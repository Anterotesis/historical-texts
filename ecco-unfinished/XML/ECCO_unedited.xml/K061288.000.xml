<HEAD>Robinson Crusoe's
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S the Design of every Thing
is said to be first in the In∣tention,
and last in the
Execution; so I come now
to acknowledge to my Reader, That
the present Work is not merely the
Product of the two first Volumes,
but the two first Volumes may rather
be called the Product of this: The
Fable is always made for the Moral,
not the Moral for the Fable.</P>
<P>I have heard, that the envious and
ill-disposed Part of the World have
rais'd some Objections against the
two first Volumes, on Pretence, <HI>for
want of a better Reason;</HI> That (<HI>as
they say</HI>) the Story is feign'd, that
the Names are borrow'd, and that
<PB REF="4"/>
it is all a Romance; that there never
were any such Man or Place, or Cir∣cumstances
in any Mans Life; that
it is all form'd and embellish'd by
Invention to impose upon the World.</P>
<P>I <HI>Robinson Crusoe</HI> being at this
Time in perfect and sound Mind and
Memory, Thanks be to God there∣fore;
do hereby declare, their Obje∣ction
is an Invention scandalous in
Design, and false in Fact; and do
affirm, that the Story, though Alle∣gorical,
is also Historical; and that
it is the beautiful Representation of a
Life of unexampled Misfortunes, and
of a Variety not to be met with in
the World, sincerely adapted to, and
intended for the common Good of
Mankind, and designed at first, <HI>as it
is now farther apply'd,</HI> to the most
serious Uses possible.</P>
<P>Farther, that there is a Man alive,
and well known too, the Actions of
whose Life are the just Subject of these
<PB REF="5"/>
Volumes, and to whom all or most
Part of the Story most directly alludes,
this may be depended upon for Truth,
and to this I set my Name.</P>
<P>The famous History of <HI>Don Quixot,</HI>
a Work which thousands read with
Pleasure, to one that knows the
Meaning of it, was an emblematic
History of, and a just Satyr upon the
Duke <HI>de Medina Sidonia;</HI> a Person
very remarkable at that Time in <HI>Spain:</HI>
To those who knew the Original, the
Figures were lively and easily disco∣vered
themselves, as they are also
here, and the Images were just; and
therefore, when a malicious, but
foolish Writer, in the abundance of
his Gall, spoke of <HI>the Quixotism</HI> of
<HI>R. Crusoe,</HI> as he called it, he shewed
evidently, that he knew nothing of
what he said; and perhaps will be
a little startled, when I shall tell
him, that what he meant for a
Satyr,
was the greatest of Panegyricks.</P>
<P><PB REF="6"/>
Without letting the Reader into a
nearer Explication of the Matter, I
proceed to let him know, that the
happy Deductions I have employ'd
myself to make from all the Cir∣cumstances
of my Story, will abun∣dantly
make him amends for his
not having the Emblem explained
by the Original; and that when in
my Observations and Reflexions of
any Kind in this Volume, I mention
my Solitudes and Retirements, and
allude to the Circumstances of the
former Story, all those Parts of the
Story are real Facts in my History,
whatever borrow'd Lights they may be
represented by: Thus the Fright and
Fancies which succeeded the Story of
the Print of a Man's Foot, and Surprise
of the old Goat, and the Thing roll∣ling
on my Bed, and my jumping
out in a Fright, are all Histories and
real Stories; as are likewise the Dream
of being taken by Messengers, being
<PB REF="7"/>
arrested by Officers, the Manner of
being driven on Shore by the Surge of
the Sea, the Ship an Fire, the Descrip∣tion
of starving; the Story of my Man
<HI>Friday,</HI> and many more most material
Passages observ'd here, and on which
any religious Reflections are made,
are all historical and true in Fact:
It is most real, that I had a Parrot,
and taught it to call me by my Name,
such a Servant a Savage, and after∣wards
a Christian, and that his Name
was called <HI>Friday,</HI> and that he was
ravish'd from me by Force, and died
in the Hands that took him, which I
represent by being killed; this is all
litterally true, and should I enter in∣to
Discoveries, many alive can testify
them: His other Conduct and As∣sistance
to me also have just Referen∣ces
in all their Parts to the Helps I had
from that faithful Savage, in my real
Solitudes and Disasters.</P>
<P><PB REF="8"/>
The Story of the Bear in the Tree,
and the Fight with the Wolves in the
Snow, is likewise Matter of real Hi∣story;
and in a Word, the Adven∣tures
of <HI>Robinson Crusoe,</HI> are one
whole Scheme of a real Life of eight
and twenty Years, spent in the
most wandring desolate and afflict∣ing
Circumstances that ever Man
went through, and in which I have
liv'd so long in a Life of Wonders in
continu'd Storms, fought with the
worse kind of Savages and Man∣eaters,
by unaccountable supprising
Incidents; fed by Miracles greater
than that of Ravens, suffered all
Manner of Violences and Oppres∣sions,
injurious Reproaches, con∣tempt
of Men, Attacks of Devils,
Corrections from Heaven, and Oppo∣sions
on Earth; have had innumera∣ble
Ups and Downs in Matters of
Fortune, been in Slavery worse than
<HI>Turkish,</HI> escaped by an exquisite
<PB REF="9"/>
Management, as that in the Story of
<HI>Xury,</HI> and the Boat at <HI>Sallee,</HI> been
taken up at Sea in Distress, rais'd a∣gain
and depress'd again, and that
oftner perhaps in one Man's life
than ever was known before; Ship∣wreck'd
often, tho' more by Land
than by Sea: In a Word, there's not
a Circumstance in the imaginary Sto∣ry,
but has its just Allusion to a
real Story, and chimes Part for Part,
and Step for Step with the inimitable
Life of <HI>Robinson Crusoe.</HI></P>
<P>In like Manner, when in these Re∣flections,
I speak of the Times and
Circumstances of particular Actions
done, or Incidents which happened
in my Solitude and Island-Life,
an impartial Reader will be so just
to take it as it is; <HI>viz.</HI> that it is spo∣ken
or intended of that Part of the
real Story, which the Island-Life is a
just Allusion to; and in this the
Story is not only illustrated, but the
<PB REF="10"/>
real Part I think most justly approv'd:
<HI>For Example,</HI> in the latter Part of
this Work called the Vision, I begin
thus, <HI>When I was in my Island King∣dom,
I had abundance of strange
Notions of my seeing Apparitions,</HI>
&amp;c. all these Reflections are just Hi∣story
of a State of forc'd Confine∣ment,
which in my real History is
represented by a confin'd Retreat
in an Island; and 'tis as reasonable to
represent one kind of Imprisonment
by another, as it is to represent any
Thing that really exists, by that
which exists not. The Story of my
Fright with something on my Bed,
was Word for Word a History of
what happened, and indeed all those
Things received very little Altera∣tion,
except what necessarily attends
removing the Scene from one Place
to another.</P>
<P>My Observations upon Solitude
are the same, and I think I need say
<PB REF="11"/>
no more, than that the same Remark
is to be made upon all the References
made here, to the Transactions of the
former Volumes, and the Reader is
desired to allow for it as he goes on.</P>
<P>Besides all this, here is the just and
only good End of all Parable or Al∣legorick
History brought to pass, <HI>viz.</HI>
for moral and religious Improve∣ment.
Here is invincible Patience
recommended under the worst of
Misery; indefatigable Application
and undaunted Resolution under
the greatest and most discouraging
Circumstances; I say, these are re∣commended,
as the only Way to
work through those Miseries, and
their Success appears sufficient to
support the most dead-hearted Crea∣ture
in the World.</P>
<P>Had the common Way of Writ∣ing
a Mans private History been ta∣ken,
and I had given you the Con∣duct
or Life of a Man you knew,
<PB REF="12"/>
and whose Misfortunes and Infirmi∣ties,
perhaps you had sometimes un∣justly
triumph'd over; all I could have
said would have yielded no Diver∣sion,
and perhaps scarce have obtain∣ed
a Reading, or at best no Attention;
the Teacher, <HI>like a greater,</HI> having
no Honour in his own Country.
Facts that are form'd to touch the
Mind, must be done a great Way off,
and by somebody never heard of:
Even the Miracles of the Blessed Sa∣viour
of the World suffered Scorn
and Contempt, when it was reflected,
that they were done by the Carpen∣ter's
Son; one whose Family and O∣riginal
they had a mean Opinion of,
and whose Brothers and Sisters were
ordinary People like themselves.</P>
<P>There even yet remains a Que∣stion,
whether the Instruction of
these Things will take place, when
you are supposing the Scene, which
is placed so far off, had its Original
so near Home.</P>
<P><PB REF="13"/>
But I am far from being anxious
about that, seeing I am well assur'd,
that if the Obstinacy of our Age
should shut their Ears against the just
Reflections made in this Volume,
upon the Transactions taken Notice
of in the former, there will come an
Age, when the Minds of Men shall
be more flexible, when the Prejudi∣ces
of their Fathers shall have no
Place, and when the Rules of Ver∣tue
and Religion justly recommend∣ed,
shall be more gratefully accep∣ted
than they may be now, that
our Children may rise up in Judg∣ment
against their fathers, and one
Generation be edified by the same
Teaching, which another Generation
had despised.</P>

<HEAD>THE
Publisher's Introduction.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE publishing this extraordinary
Volume will appear to be no Pre∣sumption,
when it shall be remembred,
with what unexpected Good <HI>and
Evil</HI> Will, the former Volumes have been ac∣cepted
in the World.</P>
<P>If the Foundation has been so well laid, the
Structure cannot but be expected to bear a Pro∣portion;
and while the Parable has been so di∣verting,
the Moral must certainly be equally
agreeable.</P>
<P>The success the two former Parts have met
with, has been known by the Envy it has
brought upon the Editor, express'd in a thousand
hard Words from the Men of Trade; the Effect
of that Regret which they entertain'd, at their
having no Share in it: And I must do the Au∣thor
the Justice to say, that not a Dog has
wag'd his Tongue at the Work itself, nor has a
Word been said to lessen the Value of it, but
which has been the visible Effect of that Envy
at the good Fortune of the Bookseller.</P>
<P><PB REF="15"/>
The Riddle is now expounded, and the inte¦ligent
Reader may see clearly the End and De∣sign
of the whole Works; that it is calculated for,
and dedicated to the Improvement and Instru∣ction
of Mankind in the Ways of Vertue and
Piety, by representing the various Circumstances,
to which Mankind is exposed; and encouraging
such as fall into ordinary or extraordinary Ca∣sualties
of Life, how to work thro' Difficulties,
with unwearied Diligence and Application,
and look up to Providence for Success.</P>
<P>The Observations and Reflections, that take
up this volume, crown the Work; if the Do∣ctrine
has been accepted, the Application must of
Necessity please; and the Author shews now,
that he has learn'd sufficient Experience, how
to make other Men wise and himself happy.</P>
<P>The Moral of the Fable, <HI>as the Author calls
it,</HI> is most instructing; and those who challeng'd
him most maliciously, with not making his Pen
useful, will have Leisure to reflect, that they
pass'd their Censure too soon; and like <HI>Solo∣mon</HI>'s
Fool, <HI>judged of the Matter before they,
heard it.</HI></P>
<P>Those whose Avarice prevailing over their
Honesty, had invaded the Property of this
Book by a corrupt Abridgment, have both fail'd
in their Hope, and been ashamed of the Fact;
shifting off the Guilt as well as they could, <HI>tho'
weakly,</HI> from one to another: The principal Py∣rate
is gone to his Place, and we say no more
of him, <HI>De mortuis nil nisi bonum;</HI> 'tis Satis∣faction
<PB REF="16"/>
enough, that the Attempt has prov'd a∣bortive,
as the Baseness of the Design might
give them Reason to expect it would.</P>

OBSERVATIONS.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>I</HI> Must have made very little Use of my solitary and wan∣dring
Years, if after such a Scene of Wonders, as
my Life may be justly call'd, I had nothing to say,
and had made no Observations which might be useful
and instructing, as well as pleasant and diverting to
those that are to come after me.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of SOLITƲDE.</HEAD>
<Q>How uncapable to make us happy, and
How unqualify'd to a Christian Life.</Q>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Have frequently look'd back, you may
be sure, and that with different
Thoughts, upon the Notions of a
long tedious Life of Solitude, which
I have represented to the World,
and of which you must have formed some Ideas
from the Life of a Man in an Island. Sometimes
<PB N="2" REF="18"/>
I have wonder'd how it could be supported, espe∣cially
for the first Years, when the Change was
violent and impos'd, and Nature unacquainted with
any thing like it. Sometimes I have as much
wonder'd, why it should be any Grievance or Af∣fliction;
seeing upon the whole View of the Stage
of Life which we act upon in this World, it
seems to me, that Life in general is, or ought to be,
but one universal Act of Solitude: But I find it is
natural to judge of Happiness, by its suiting or
not suiting our own Inclinations. Every Thing
revolves in our Minds by innumerable circular
Motions, all centring in our selves. We judge
of Prosperity, and of Affliction, Joy and Sorrow,
poverty, Riches, and all the various Scenes of
Life: I say, we judge of them by our selves: Thi∣ther
we bring them Home, as Meats touch the
Palat, by which we try them; the gay Part of
the World, or the heavy Part; it is all one, they
only call it pleasant or unpleasant, as they suit
our Taste.</P>
<P>The World, I say, is nothing to us, but as it
is more or less to our Relish: All Reflection is
carry'd Home, and our Dear-self is, in one Respect,
the End of Living. Hence Man may be proper∣ly
said to be <HI>alone</HI> in the Midst of the Crowds
and Hurry of Men and Business: All the Refle∣ctions
which he makes, are to himself; all that
is pleasant, he embraces for himself; all that is
irksome and grievous, is tasted but by his own
Palat.</P>
<P>What are the Sorrows of other Men to us? And
what their joy? Something we may be touch'd
indeed with, by the Power of Sympathy, and a
secret Turn of the Affections; but all the solid
Reflection is directed to our selves. Our Medi∣tations
are all Solitude in Perfection; our Passions
<PB N="3" REF="19"/>
are all exercised in Retirement; we love, we hate,
we covet, we enjoy, all in Privacy and Solitude:
All that we communicate of those Things to any
other, is but for their Assistance in the Pursuit of
our Desires; the End is at Home; the Enjoy∣ment,
the Contemplation, is all Solitude and Re∣tirement,
`tis for our selves we enjoy, and for
our selves we suffer.</P>
<P>What then is the Silence of Life? And, How
is it afflicting, while a Man has the Voice of his
Soul to speak to God, and to himself? That Man
can never want Conversation, who is Company
for himself; and he that cannot converse profita∣bly
with himself, is not fit for any Conversation
at all; and yet there are many good Reasons why
a Life of Solitude; as Solitude is now understood
by the Age, is not at all suited to the Life of a
Christian, or of a wise Man. Without enquiring
therefore into the Advantages of Solitude, and
how it is to be managed, I desire to be heard
concerning what Solitude really is; for I must con∣fess,
I have different Notions about it, far from
those which are generally understood in the World,
and far from all those Notions upon which those
People in the primitive Times, and since that also,
acted, who separated themselves into Desarts
and unfrequented Places, or confin'd themselves to
Cells, Monasteries, and the like, retir'd, as they
call it, from the World; All which, I think,
have nothing of the Thing I call Solitude in them,
nor do they answer any of the true Ends of Solitude,
much less those Ends which are pretended to be
sought after, by those who have talk'd most of
those Retreats from the World.</P>
<P>As for Confinement in an Island, if the Scene
was plac'd there for this very End, it were not at
all amiss. I must acknowledge, there was Con∣finement
<PB N="4" REF="20"/>
from the Enjoyments of the World, and
Restraint from human Society: <HI>But all that was
no Solitude;</HI> indeed no Part of it was so, except
that which, as in my Story, I apply'd to the
Contemplation of sublime Things, and that was
but a very little, as my Readers well know, com∣par'd
to what a Length of Years my forced Retreat
lasted.</P>
<P>It is evident then, that as I sce nothing but
what is far from being retir'd, in the forced Re∣treat
of an Island, the Thoughts being in no Com∣posure
suitable to a retired Condition, no not for a
great While; so I can affirm, that I enjoy much more
Solitude in the Middle of the greatest Collection
of Mankind in the World, I mean, at <HI>London,</HI>
while I am writing this, than ever I could say I
enjoy'd in eight and twenty Years Confinnement
to a desolate Island.</P>
<P>I have heard of a Man, that upon some extraor∣dinary
Disgust which he took at the unsuitable
Conversation of some of his nearest Relations,
whose Society he could not avoid, suddenly resolved
never to speak any more: He kept his Resolution
most rigorously many Years; not all the Tears or
Entreaties of his Friends, no not of his Wife and
Children, could prevail with him to break his Si∣lence.
It seems it was their ill Behaviour to him
at first, that was the Occasion of it; for they
treated him with provoking Language, which
frequently put him into undecent Passions, and ur∣ged
him to rash Replies; and he took this severe
Way to punish himself for being provok'd, and to pu∣nish
them for provoking him: But the Severity was
unjustifiable; it ruin'd his Family, and broke up
his House: His Wife could not bear it, and after
endeavouring, by all the Ways possible, to alter his
rigid Silence, went first away from him, and af∣terwards
<PB N="5" REF="21"/>
away from her self, turning melancholly
and distracted: His Children separated some one
Way, and some another Way, and only one
Daughter who lov'd her Father above all the rest,
kept with him, tended him, talk'd to him by
Signs, and liv'd almost Dumb like her Father,
near 29 Years with him; till being very sick,
and in a high Fever, delirious as we call it, or
light-headed, be broke his Silence, not knowing
when he did it, and spoke, tho' wildly at first.
He recover'd of the Illness afterwards, and fre∣quently
talk'd with his Daughter, but not much,
and very seldom to any Body else.</P>
<P>Yet this Man did not live a silent Life with
respect to himself; he read continually; and wrote
down many excellent Things, which deserv'd to
have appear'd in the World, and was often heard
to pray to God in his Solitudes very audibly, and
with great Fervency; but the Unjustice which his
rash Vow, <HI>if it was a Vow,</HI> of Silence, was to his
Family, and the length he carry'd it, was so un∣justifiable
another way, that I cannot say his In∣structions
could have much Force in them.</P>
<P>Had he been a single Man, had he wandred into a
strange Country or Place, where the Circum∣stance
of it had been no Scandal, his Vow of
Silence might ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> been as commendable, and as
I think, much more than any of the primitive
Christians Vows of Solitude were; whose Re∣treat
into the Wilderness, and giving themselves up
to Prayer and Contemplation, shunning human So∣ciety,
and the like, was so much esteemed by the
primitive Fathers, and from whence our religious
Houses, and Orders of religious People were first
deriv'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jews</HI> said, <HI>John</HI> the Baptist had a Devil,
because no affected Solitude and Retirement; and
<PB N="6" REF="22"/>
they took it from an old Proverb they had in the
World at that time: <HI>That every solitary Person must
be an Angel or a Devil.</HI></P>
<P>A Man under a Vow of perpetual Silence, if
but rigorously observ'd, would be even on the Ex∣change
of <HI>London,</HI> as perfectly retired from the
World, as a Hermit in his Cell; or a <HI>Solitair</HI> in
the Desarts of <HI>Arabia;</HI> and if he is able to ob∣serve
it rigorously, may reap all the Advantages
or those Solitudes, without the unjustifiable Part
of such a Life, and without the Austerities of a
Life among Brutes. For the Soul of a Man un∣der
a due and regular Conduct, is as capable of
reserving it self, or separating it self from the rest
of human Society, in the midst of a Throng, as
it is when banish'd into a desolate Island.</P>
<P>The Truth is, that all those religious Hermit∣like
Solitudes, which Men value themselves so
much upon, are but an Acknowledgment of the
Defect or Imperfection of our Resolutions, our
Incapacity to bind our selves to needful Restraints,
or rigorously to observe the Limitations we have
vow'd our selves to observe; <HI>Or take it thus,</HI> That
the Man first resolving that it would be his Feli∣city
to be entirely given up to conversing only
with Heaven, and heavenly Things, to be sepa∣rated
to Prayer and good Works; but being sen∣sible
how ill such a Life will agree with Flesh and
Blood, causes his Soul to commit a Rape upon his
Body, and to carry it by Force, as it were into
a Desart, or into a religious Retirement, from
whence it cannot return, and where it is impossible
for it to have any Converse with Mankind, other
than with such as are under the same Vows, and
same Banishment. The Folly of this is evident
many Ways.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="23"/>
I shall bring it home to the Case in Hand thus:
Christians may without doubt come to enjoy all
the desirable Advantages of Solitude, by a strict
Retirement, and exact Government of their
Thoughts, without any of these Formalities, Ri∣gours,
and apparent Mortifications, which I think
I justly call a Rape upon human Nature, and conse∣quently
without the Breach of Christian Duties,
which they necessarily carry with them, such as
rejecting Christian Communion, Sacraments, Or∣dinances,
and the like.</P>
<P>There is no need of a Wilderness to wander
among wild Beasts, no necessity of a Cell on the
top of a Mountain, or a desolate Island in the
Sea; if the Mind be confin'd, if the Soul be truly
Master of it self, all is safe; for it is certainly and
effectually Master of the Body, and what signify
Retreats, especially a forc'd Retreat as mine was?
The anxiety of my Circumstances there, I can assure
you, was such for a Time, as were very suitable
to heavenly Meditations, and even when that was
got over, the frequent Alarms from the Savages,
put the Soul sometimes to such Extremities of
Fear and Horrour, that all manner of Temper was
lost, and I was no more fit for religious Exercises,
than a sick Man is fit for Labour,</P>
<P>Divine Contemplations require a Composure
of Soul, uninterrupted by any extraordinary Mo∣tions
or Disorders of the Passions; and this, I
say, is much easier to be obtained and enjoy'd in
the ordinary Course of Life, than in Monkish Cells
and forcible Retreats.</P>
<P>The Business is to get a retired Soul, a Frame of
Mind truly elevated above the World, and then
we may be alone whenever we please, in the
greatest apparent Hurry of Business or Com∣pany:
If the Thoughts are free, and rightly un∣engag'd,
<PB N="8" REF="24"/>
What Imports the Employment the Body
is engag'd in? Does not the Soul act by a dif∣fering
Agency, and is not the Body the Servant,
nay, the Slave of the Soul? Has the Body Hands
to act, or Feet to walk, or Tongue to speak,
but by the Agency of the Understanding, and
Will, which are the two Deputies of the Soul's
Power? Are not all the Affections, and all the
Passions which so universally agitate, direct, and
possess the Body, are they not all seated in the
Soul? What have we to do then more or less, but
to get the Soul into a superior Direction and Ele∣vation,
there's no Need to prescribe the Bo∣dy
to this or that Situation; the Hands, or Feet,
or Tongue, can no more disturb the Retirement of
the Soul, than a Man having Money in his Pocket
can take it out, or pay it, or dispose of it by his
Hand, without his own Knowledge.</P>
<P>It is the Soul's being entangled by outward Ob∣jects,
that interrupts its Contemplation of divine
Objects, which is the Excuse for these Solitudes,
and makes the removing the Body from those out∣ward
Objects seemingly necessary; but what is
there of Religion in all this? For Example, a vi∣cious
Inclination remov'd from the Object, is still
a vicious Inclination, and contracts the same Guilt,
as if the Object were at Hand; for if, as our
Saviour says, <HI>He that looketh on a Woman to lust
after her,</HI> that is, to desire her unlawfully, has
committed the Adultery already; so it will▪ be no
inverting our Saviour's Meaning to say, that he
that thinketh of a Woman to desire her unlawfully,
has committed Adultery with her already, though
he has not looked on her, or has not seen her at
that Time; and how shall this thinking of her be
remov'd by transporting the Body? It must be
remov'd by the Change in the Soul, by bringing
<PB N="9" REF="25"/>
the Mind to be above the Power or Reach of the
Allurement, and to an absolute Mastership over
the wicked Desire; otherwise the vicious Desire
remains as the Force remains in the Gunpowder,
and will exert it self when ever toucht with the
Fire.</P>
<P>All Motions to Good or Evil are in the Soul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Outward Objects are but second Causes; and tho'
it is true, separating the Man from the Object, is
the Way to make any Act impossible to be com∣mitted;
yet where the Guilt does not lye in the
Act only, but in the Intention or Desire to com∣mit
it, that Separation is nothing at all, and ef∣fects
nothing at all. There may be as much Adul∣tery
committed in a Monastery, where a Woman
never comes, as in any other Place, and perhaps
is so: The abstaining from Evil therefore depends
not only and wholly upon limiting, or confining
the Man's Actions, but upon the Man's limiting
and confining his Desires; seeing to desire to sin,
<HI>is to Sin;</HI> and the Fact which we would commit
if we had Opportunity, is really committed, and
must be answer'd for as such. What then is
there of Religion, I say, in forc'd Retirements
from the World, and Vows of Silence or Soli∣tude?
They are all nothing; `tis a retired Soul
that alone is fit for Contemplation; and it is the
Conquest of our Desires to Sin, that is the only
human Preservative against Sin.</P>
<P>It was a great while after I came into human
Society, that I felt some Regret at the Loss of the
solitary Hours and Retirements I had in the I∣sland;
but when I came to reflect upon some ill
spent Time, even in my Solitudes, I found Rea∣son
to see what I have said above; that a Man
may sin alone several Ways, and find subject of
<PB N="10" REF="26"/>
Repentance for his solitary Crimes, as well as he
may in the midst of a populous City.</P>
<P>The Excellency of any State of Life consists
in its Freedom from Crime; and it is evident to
our Experience, that some Society may be better
adapted to a Rectitude of Life, than a compleat
Solitude and Retirement: Some have said, that
<HI>next to no Company, good Company is best;</HI> but it is my
Opinion, that <HI>next to good Company, no Company is
best;</HI> for as it is certain, that <HI>no Company</HI> is better
than <HI>bad Company,</HI> so 'tis as certain, that <HI>good Com∣pany</HI>
is much better than <HI>no Company.</HI></P>
<P>In Solitude a Man converses with himself, and
as a wise Man said, he is not always sure that he
does not converse with his Enemy; but he that
is in good Company, is sure to be always among
his Friends.</P>
<P>The Company of religious good Men, is a
constant Restraint from Evil, and an Encouragement
to a religious Life. You have there the Beauty of
Religion exemplified; you never want as well In∣struction
in, as Example for, all that is good; you
have a Contempt of evil Things constantly re∣commended,
and the Affections mov'd to delight
in what is good by hou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly Imitation: If we are
alone, we want all these, and are led right, or led
wrong, as the Temper of the Mind, which is
sometimes too much the Guide of our Actions, as
well as Thoughts, happens to be constituted at that
Time. Here we have no Restraint upon our
Thoughts, but from our selves, no Restraint upon
our Actions, but from our own Consciences, and
nothing to assist us in our Mortifications of our
Desires, or in directing our Desires, but our own
Reflections, which after all may often err, often
be prepossess'd.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="27"/>
If you wou'd retreat from the World then, be
sure to retreat to good Company; retreat to good
Books, and retreat to good Thoughts; these will
always assist one another, and always join to assist
him that flies to them in his Meditations, di∣rect
him to just Reflections, and mutually encou∣rage
him against whatever may attack him, from
within him, or without him: Whereas to retreat
from the World, as it is call'd, is to retreat from
good Men, who are our best Friends: Besides,
to retreat, as we call it to an entire perfect Soli∣tude,
is to retreat from the publick Worship of
God, to forsake the Assemblies; and, in a Word,
is unlawful, because it obliges us to abandon
those Things, which we are commanded to do.</P>
<P>Solitude therefore, as I understand by it, a
Retreat from human Society, on a religious or
philosophical Account, Is a meer Cheat; it nei∣ther
can answer the End it proposes, or qualify
us for the Duties of Religion, which we are com∣manded
to perform; and is therefore both irreli∣gious
in it self, and inconsistent with a Christian
Life many Ways. Let the Man that would reap
the Advantage of Solitude, and that understands
the Meaning of the Word, learn to retire into
himself: Serious Meditation is the Essence of So∣litude;
all the Retreats into Woods and Desarts
are short of this; and though a Man that is per∣fectly
Master of this Retirement, may be a little
in Danger of Quietism, that is to say, of an Af∣fectation
of Reservedness; yet it may be a Slander
upon him in the main, and he may make himself
amends upon the World, by the blessed Calm of
his Soul, which they perhaps who appear more
chearful may have little of</P>
<P>Retiring into Desarts, in the first Days of Reli∣gion,
and into Abbeys and Mcnasteries since,
<PB N="12" REF="28"/>
what have they been? Or what have they been
able to do, towards purchasing the Retirement I
speak of? They have indeed been Things to be
reckon'd among Austerities, and Acts of Mortifi∣cation,
and so far might be commendable: But I
must insist upon it, that a retired Soul is not affe∣cted
with them, any more than with the Hurries
of Company and Society. When the Soul of a
Man is powerfully engag'd in any particular Sub∣ject,
'tis like that of St. <HI>Paul, wrapt up,</HI> whether
it be into the third Heaven, or to any Degree
of lower Exaltation: Such a Man may well say
with the Apostle above, <HI>Whether I was in the Body,
or out of the Body, I cannot tell.</HI> It was in such a
wrapt up State, that I conceived in what I call my
<HI>Vision of the Angelical World;</HI> of which I have
here subjoined a very little Part.</P>
<P>Is it rational to believe, that a Mind exalted so
far above the State of Things with which we ordi∣narily
converse, should not be capable of a Sepa∣ration
from them, which, in a Word, is the ut∣most
Extent of Solitude? Let such never afflict
themselves, that they cannot retreat from the
World: Let them learn to retreat in the World,
and they shall enjoy a perfect Solitude; as com∣pleat
to all Intents and Purposes, as it they were
to live in the Cupola of St. <HI>Paul's,</HI> or, as if they
were to live upon the Top of <HI>Cheviot</HI> Hill in
<HI>Northumberland.</HI></P>
<P>They that cannot be retir'd in this Manner,
must not only retire from the World, but out of
the World, before they can arrive to any true
Solitude. Man is a Creature so form'd for Socie∣ty,
that it may not only be said, that it is not
good for him to be alone, but 'tis really impos∣sible
he should be alone: We are so continually in
need of one another; nay, in such absolute Ne∣cessity
<PB N="13" REF="29"/>
of Assistance from one another, that those
who have pretended to give us the Lives and
Manner of the <HI>Solitaires,</HI> as they call them, who
separated themselves, from Mankind, and wander'd
in the Desarts of <HI>Arabia</HI> and <HI>Lybia,</HI> are frequently
put to the Trouble of bringing the Angels down
from Heaven to do one Drudgery or another for
them; forming imaginary Miracles, to make the
Life of a true Solitair possible; sometimes they
have no Bread, sometimes no Water, for a long
Time together; and then a Miracle is brought
upon the Stage, to make them live so long with∣out
Food; at other Times they have Angels come
to be their Cooks, and bring them Roast-meat; to
be their Physicians, to bring them Physick, and
the like: If Saint <HI>Hillary</HI> comes in his Wan∣drings
to the River <HI>Nile,</HI> an humble Crocrodile
is brought to carry him over upon his Back; tho'
they do not tell us, whether the Crocodile ask'd
him, to ride, or he ask'd the Crocodile, or by what
Means they came to be so familiar with one ano∣ther:
And, what, is all this to the Retirement of
the Soul, with which it converses in Heaven in
the midst of infinite Crowds of Men, and to whom
the nearest of other Objects is nothing at all, any
more than the Objects of Mountains and Desarts,
Lions and Leopards, and the like, were to those
that banish'd themselves to <HI>Arabia?</HI></P>
<P>Besides, in a State of Life, where Circumstan∣ces
are easy, and Provision for the Necessaries of
Life, which the best Saint cannot support the
Want of, is quietly and plentifully made; has not
the Mind infinitely more Room to withdraw
from the World, than when at best it must wan∣der
for its daily Food, tho' it were but the Pro∣duct
of' the Field.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="30"/>
Let no Man plead he wants Retirement, that
he loves Solitude, but cannot enjoy it, because of
the Embarrassment of the World; `tis all a Delusi∣on;
if he loves it, if he desires it, he may have it
when, where; and as often as he pleases; let his
Hurries, his Labours, or his Afflictions, be what
they will: It is not the Want of an Opportunity
for Solitude, but the Want of a Capacity of being
solitairy that is the Case in all the Circumstances
of Life.</P>
<P>I knew a poor, but good Man; who tho' he was
a Labourer, was a Man of Sense and Religion;
who being hard at Work with some other Men,
removing a great Quantity of Earth to raise a
Bank against the Side of a Pond, was one Day so
out of himself, and wrapt up in a perfect Appli∣cation
of his Mind, to a very serious Subject,
that the poor Man drove himself and his Wheel-barrow
into the Pond, and could not recover him∣self,
till Help came to him. This Man was cer∣tainly
capable of a perfect Solitude, and perhaps
really enjoy'd it; for as I have often heard him
say, he liv'd alone in the World: (1.) Had no
Family to embarrass his Affections. (2.) His low
Circumstances placed him below the Observation
of the upper Degrees of Mankind. (3.) And his
reserv'd Meditations plac'd him above the wicked
Part, who were those in a Sphere equal to him∣self;
among whom, as he said, <HI>and is most true,</HI>
it was very hard to find a sober Man, much less a
good Man; so that he liv'd really alone in the
World; apply'd himself to labour for his Subsistance,
had no other Business with Mankind, but for Ne∣cessaries
of Life, and convers'd in Heaven, as ef∣fectually,
and, I believe, every Way, as divinely
as Sr. <HI>Hilary</HI> did in the Desarts of <HI>Lybia,</HI> among
the Lions and Crocodiles.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="31"/>
If this Retirement, which they call <HI>Solitude,</HI> con∣sisted
only of separating the Person from the World,
that is to say, from human Society, it were itself
a very mean Thing, and would every Way as well
be supplied, by removing from a Place where a
Man is known, to a Place where he is not known,
and there accustom himself to a retir'd Life, ma∣king
no new Acquaintance, and only making the
Use of Mankind which I have already, spoken of;
namely for Convenience, and Supply of necessary
Food; and I think of the Two, that such a Man,
or a Man so rerir'd, may have more Opportunity
to be an entire Recluse, and may enjoy more real
Solitude, than a Man in a Desart. For Example,</P>
<P>In the Solitude I speak of, a Man has no more
to do for the Necessaries of Life, than to receive
them from the Hands of those that are to furnish
them, and pay them for so doing; whereas, in
the Solitude of Desarts, and wandring Lives, from
whence all our Monkish Devotion springs, they
had every Day their Food, such as it was, to
seek, or the Load of it to carry; and except where
as it is said, they put Providence to the Opera∣tion
of a Miracle, to furnish it, they had frequently
Difficulties enough to sustain Life; and if we
may believe History, many of them were starv'd
to Death for meer Hunger, or Thirst; and as
often the latter as the former.</P>
<P>Those that had Recourse to these Solitudes,
merely as a Mortification of their Bodies, as I
observ'd before, and delivering themselves from the
Temptations! which Society exposed them to,
had more Room for the Pretence indeed, than
those who alledge they did it to give up them∣selves
to Prayer and Meditation. The first might:
have some Reason in Nature for the Fact, as
<PB N="16" REF="32"/>
Mens Tempers and Constitutions might lead;
some having an inordinate Appetite to Crime,
some addicted by Nature to one ill Habit, some
to another; tho' the Christian Religion does
not guide us to those Methods of putting
a Force upon our Bodies to subdue the
Violence of incrdinate Appetite. The blessed
Apostle St. <HI>Paul</HI> seems to have been in this
Circumstance, when being assaulted with what is
call'd in the Text, <HI>a Thorn in the Flesh;</HI> be it what
it will that is meant there, it is not to my Pur∣pose;
but he pray'd to the Lord thrice; that was
the first Method the Apostle took, and thereby set
a pious Example to all those who are assaulted by
any Temptation. He did not immediately fly
to Austerities and bodily Mortifications, separa∣ting
himself from Mankind, or flying into the
Desart to give himself up to Fasting, and a Re∣treat
from the World, which is the Object of all
private Snare. But he applied himself by serious
Prayer to him, who had taught us to pray, <HI>Lead
us not into Temptation;</HI> and the Answer likewise is
instructing in the Case; he was not driven out as
<HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> into the Desart; he was not com∣manded
to retire into the Wilderness, that he
might be free from the Temptation; <HI>nothing less:</HI>
But the Answer was, <HI>my Grace is sufficient for thee,</HI>
sufficient without the Help of artificail Mortifica∣tion.</P>
<P>So that even in the Case of these forcible Morti∣fications
they are not requir'd, much less directed
for Helps to Meditation for if Meditation could
not be practis'd beneficially, and to all the Intents
and Purposes for which it was ordain'd a Duty,
without flying from the Face of human Society,
the Life of Man would be very unhappy.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="33"/>
But doubtless the Contrary is evident, and all
the Parts of a compleat Solitude are to be as ef∣factually
enjoy'd, if we please, and sufficient Grace
assisting, even in the most populous Cities, among
the Hurries of Conversation, and Gallantry of a
Court, or the Noise and Business of a Camp, as in
the Desarts of <HI>Arabia</HI> and <HI>Lybia,</HI> or in the desolate
Life of an uninhabited Island.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An Essay upon HONESTY.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HEN I first came home to my own
Country, and began to sit down and
look back upon the past Circumstan∣ces
of my wandring State, as you
will in Charity suppose I could not
but do very often; the very Prosperity I enjoy'd
led me most naturally to reflect upon the particu∣lar
Steps by which I arriv'd to it. The Condi∣tion
I was in was very happy, speaking of hu∣man
Felicity; the former Captivity I had suffer'd,
made my Liberty sweeter to me; and to find my
self jump'd into easy Circumstances at once, from
a Condition below the common Rate of Life,
made it still sweeter.</P>
<P>One Time, as I was upon my Enquiries into
the happy Concurrence of the Causes which
had brought the Event of my Prosperity to
pass, as an Effect, it occurr'd to my Thoughts,
how much of it all depended, under the
Disposition of Providence, upon the Principle
of <HI>Honesty,</HI> which I met with, in almost all the
People whom it was my Lot to be concern'd with
in my private and particular Affairs; and I that
had met with such extraordinary Instances of the
Knavery and Villainy of Mens Natures in other
Circumstances, could not but be somthing taken
<PB N="19" REF="35"/>
up with Miracles of Honesty that I had met
with among the several People I had had to do
with, I mean those whom I had more particularly
to do with in the Articles of my Liberty, Estate,
or Effects, which fell into their Hands.</P>
<P>I began with my most trusty and faithful Wi∣dow,
the Captain's Wife, with whom I first went
to the Coast of <HI>Africa,</HI> and to whom I entrusted
200 <HI>l.</HI> being the Gain I had made in my first Ad∣ventures
to <HI>Guinea,</HI> as in the first Volume, Page
330, appears.</P>
<P>She was left a Widow, and in but indifferent
Circumstances; but when I sent to her so far off as
the <HI>Brasils,</HI> where I was in such a Condition as she
might have reasonably believed I should never
have been able to come my self; and if I had,
might be in no Condition to recover it of her;
and having my self nothing to shew under her
Hand for the Trust; yet she was so just, that she
sent the full Value of what I wrote for, being
one hundred Pound; and to shew, as far as in her
lay, her sincere honest Concern for my Good, put
in among many necessary Things which I did not
write for, I say, put in two Bibles, besides other
good Books, for my Reading and Instruction, as
she said afterwards, in Popish and Heathen Coun∣tries,
where I might chance to fall. Honesty not
only leads to discharge every Debt and every Trust
to our Neighbour, so far as is justly to be deman∣ded,
but an honest Man acknowledges himself
Debtor to all Mankind, for so much Good to be
done for them, whether for Soul or Body, as Pro∣vidence
puts an Opportunity into his Hands to do:
In Order to discharge this Debt, he studies
continually for Opportunity to do all the Acts of
Kindness and Beneficence, that is possible for him
to do; and tho' very few consider it, a Man is
<PB N="20" REF="36"/>
not a compleatly honest Man, that does not do
this.</P>
<P>Upon this Consideration, I question much,
whether a covetous, narrow, stingy Man, as we
call him, one who gives himself up to himself,
us born for himself only, and who declines the
Advantages and Opportunities of doing Good,
I mean, extreamly so: I say, I much question,
whether such a Man can be <HI>an honest Man;</HI> nay, I
am satisfy'd he cannot be honest Man; for tho'
he may pay every Man his own, and be just, as he
thinks it, to a Farthing; yet this is Part of the
Justice, which in the common Phrase is the grea∣test
Unjustice. This is one Meaning of that Say∣ing,
<HI>Summum jus, summa injuria.</HI></P>
<P>To pay every Man their own, is <HI>the common
Law</HI> of Honesty; but to do Good to all Mankind,
as far as you are able, is the <HI>Chancery</HI> Law of Ho∣nesty;
and tho' in common Law or Justice, as I
call it, Mankind can have no Claim upon us, if
we do but just pay our Debt; yet in Heaven's
<HI>Chancery</HI> they will have Relief against us; for
they have a Demand in Equity, of all the Good to
be done them, that it is in our Power to do, and
this <HI>Chancery</HI> Court, or Court of Equity, is held
in every Man's Breast; 'tis a true <HI>Court of Con∣science,</HI>
and every Man's Conscience is a Lord
Chancellour to him; if he has not perform'd,
if he has not paid this Debt, Conscience will de∣cree
him to pay it, on the Penalty of declaring
him <HI>a dishonest Man,</HI> even in his own Opinion;
and if he still refuses to comply, will proceed
by all the legal Steps of a Court of Conscience
Process, till at last it will issue out a Writ of Re∣bellion
against him, and proclaim him a Rebel to
Nature and his own Conscience.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="37"/>
But this is by the Way, and is occasioned by
the Observations I have made of many People,
who think they are mighty honest if they pay
their Debts, and owe no Man any Thing, <HI>as they
call it;</HI> at the same Time, like true Misers, who
lay up all for themselves, they think nothing of the
Debt of Charity and Beneficence, which they
owe to all Mankind.</P>
<P>Rich Men are their Maker's Free-holders;
they enjoy freely the Estate he has given them the
Possession of, with all the Rents, Profits, and
Emoluments, but charg'd with a <HI>free Farm</HI> Rent
to the younger Children of the Family, namely
to the Poor; or if you will, you may call them.
God's Copy-holders, paying a Quit-Rent to the
Lord of the Manor; which Quit-Rent he has
assigned for the Use of the rest of Mankind, to
be paid in a constant Discharge of all good Offi∣ces,
friendly, kind, and generous Actions; and
he that will not pay his Rent, cannot be an ho∣nest
Man, any more than he that would not pay
his other just Debts.</P>
<P>The Scripture concurs exactly with this No∣tion
of mine; the Miser is call'd by the Prophet
<HI>Isaiah, a vile Person, one that works Iniquity, and
practises Hypocrisy, and utters Error before the Lord,</HI>
Isaiah xxxii. 6. How does this appear? The ve∣ry
next Words explain it. <HI>He makes empty the Soul
of the Hungry, and he will cause the Drink of the
Thirsty to fail.</HI> But lest this should seem a strain'd
Text, let us read on, both before and after, <HI>Verse</HI>
5. <HI>The</HI> Vile <HI>Person shall no more be call'd</HI> Liberal,
<HI>nor the</HI> Churl <HI>said to be</HI> Bountiful. Here the Op∣posite
to a Liberal Man is call'd a Vile Person,
and the Opposite to a Bountiful Man is call'd a
Churl; and in the Verse following, the same
Vile Person, as opposed to the Liberal Man, is
<PB N="22" REF="38"/>
call'd a Wicked Man; and the Liberal Man is
set up a Pattern for us all, in Opposition to the
vile, churlish, covetous Wretch. Vers. 7, 8. <HI>The
Instruments also of the Churl are evil: He deviseth
wicked Devices to destroy the Poor with lying Words,
even when the N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edy speaketh right. But the Liberal
deviseth liberal Things, and by liberal Things shall he
stand.</HI></P>
<P>In a Word, I think my Opinion justify'd by this
Text, that a Churl, a morose, sowre Disposition,
a covetous, avaricious, selfish principl'd Man, can∣not
be an <HI>honest Man;</HI> he does not pay the common
Debt of Mankind to one another, nor the Fee-Farm,
or Quit-Rent of his Estate to God, who is his
Great Landlord, or Lord of the Manor, and who has
charg'd the Debt upon him. I know the Miser
will laugh at this Notion; but I speak my own
Opinion, let it go as far as Reason will car∣ry
it.</P>
<P>I come back to the Examples I was giving in
my private Case. As the Widow was honest to
me, so was my good <HI>Portuguese</HI> Captain; and it
is this Man's original Honesty, that makes me
speak of the honest Man's Debt to Mankind. It
was Honesty, a generous Honesty, that led the
poor Man to take me up at Sea; which if he had
neglected, my Boy <HI>Xury</HI> and I had perished toge∣ther:
It was no Debt to me in particular, but
a Debt to Mankind, that he paid in that Action;
and yet he could not have been an <HI>honest Man</HI> with∣out
it. You will say, if he had gone away and
left me, he had been barbarous and inhuman, and
deserv'd to be left to perish himself in the like
Distress: But, <HI>I say,</HI> this is not all the Case: Cu∣stom
and the Nature of the Thing leads us to say,
it would have been hard-hearted and inhuman;
But Conscience will tell any Man, that it was a
<PB N="23" REF="39"/>
Debt, and he could not but be condemn'd by the
Court of Conscience in his own Breast, if he had
omitted it; nay, in the Sight of Heaven he had
tacitly kill'd us, and had been as guilty of our
Death as a Murtherer; for he hat refuses to save
a Life thrown into his Hands, <HI>takes it away;</HI> and
if there is a just Retribution in a future State, if
Blood is at all requir'd there, the Blood of every
Man, Woman, or Child, whom we could have sa∣ved,
and did not, shall be reckon'd to us at that
Day, as spilt by our own Hands; for leaving Life
in a Posture in which it must inevitably perish,
is without Question causing it to perish, and will
be call'd so then, by whatever gilded dress'd-up
Words we may express and conceal it now.</P>
<P>But I go farther, for my good <HI>Portuguese</HI> went
farther with me; he not only paid the Debt he
ow'd to Heaven, in saving our Lives, but he
went farther: He took nothing of what I had,
tho' in the common Right, of the Sea, it was all
his Due <HI>for Salvage,</HI> as the Sailors call it: But
he gave me the Value of every Thing, bought
my Boat, which he might have turn'd adrift, my
Boy <HI>Xury,</HI> who was not my Slave by any Right,
or if he had, became free from that Time; and
the Life of <HI>Xury,</HI> which he had sav'd, as a Ser∣vant,
was his own; yet he bought every Thing
of me, for the full Value, and took nothing of
me, no not for my Passage.</P>
<P>Here was the <HI>Liberal Man devising liberal Things,</HI>
and the Sequel made good the promissory Text;
for by these liberal Things, the honest liberal
Man might be truly said to <HI>stand;</HI> When I came to
reward him at my coming to <HI>Lisbon,</HI> to sell my
Plantation at <HI>Brasil:</HI> Then he being poor, and
reduc'd, and not able to pay even what he ow'd
<PB N="24" REF="40"/>
me, I gave him a Reward sufficient to make his
Circumstances easy all his Life after.</P>
<P>The Bounty of this Man to me, when first he
took me up out of the Sea, was the highest and
most compleat Act of Honesty; A generous Ho∣nesty,
laying hold of an Opportunity to do Good
to an Object offer'd by the Providence, of Hea∣ven,
and thereby acknowledging the Debt he had
to pay to his Maker, in the Persons of his most
distress'd Creatures.</P>
<P>And here also let me remind may Readers of
what perhaps they seldom much regard; it is not
only a Gift from Heaven to us, to be put in a
Condition of <HI>doing Good;</HI> but 'tis a Gift, and a Fa∣vour
from Heaven, to, have an Opportunity of
<HI>doing the Good</HI> we are in a Condition to do; and we
ought to close with the Opportunity, as a parti∣cular
Gift from above, and be as thankful for it;
I say, as thankful for the Occasion of doing
Good, as for the Ability.</P>
<P>I might mention here the Honesty of my Fellow-Planter
in the <HI>Brasils,</HI> and of the two Merchants
and their Sons, by whose Integrity I had my
Share in the Plantation preserved, and taken Care
of; as also the Honesty of the publick Treasurer
for the Church there, and the like: But I am car∣ry'd
off in my Thoughts, to enlarge upon this no∣ble
Principle, from the two Examples, I have al∣ready
mentioned, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Guiney</HI> Captain's Wi∣dow,
and the <HI>Portuguese;</HI> and this in particular,
because, since I came to <HI>England</HI> to reside, I have
met with Abundance of Disputes about Honestly,
especially in Cases where honest Men come to be
unhappy Men, when they fall into such Circumstan∣ces
as they cannot be honest, or rather, cannot
shew the Principle of Honesty, which is really
at the Bottom of all their Actions, and which,
<PB N="25" REF="41"/>
but for those Circumstances which entirely disa∣ble
them, would certainly shew it self in every
Branch of their Lives: Such Men I have too
often seen branded for Knaves by those who,
if they come into the same Condition, would
perhaps do the same Things, or worse than they
may have done.</P>
<P>Both my Widow and my <HI>Portuguese</HI> Captain,
fell into low Circumstances, so that they could
not make good to me my Money that was
in their Hands; and yet both of them shew'd
to me, that they had not only a Principle
of Justice, but of generous Honesty too, when
the Opportunity was put into their Hands to
do so.</P>
<P>This put me upon enquiring and debating with
my self, what this subtle and imperceptible Thing,
call'd Honesty, is, and how it might be descri∣bed;
setting down my Thoughts, at several Times,
as Objects presented; that Posterity, if they think
them worth while, may find them both useful
and diverting. And <HI>First,</HI> I thought it not
improper to lay down the Conditions upon
which I am to enter upon that Description;
that I may not be mistaken, but be allow'd to ex∣plain
what I mean by Honesty, before I undertake
to enter upon any Discourses or Observations about
it.</P>
<P>And to come directly to it, <HI>for I would make as
few Preambles as possible,</HI> I shall crave the Liberty
in all the following Discourse, to take the Term
<HI>Honesty,</HI> as I think all <HI>English</HI> Expressions ought to
be taken, namely <HI>Honesterly,</HI> in the common Accep∣tation
of the Word, the general vulgar Sense of
it, without any Circumlocutions or Double Enten∣dres
whatsoever; for I desire to speak plainly
and sincerely. Indeed, as I have no Talent at hard
<PB N="26" REF="42"/>
Words, so I have no great Veneration for Etymo∣logies,
especially in <HI>English:</HI> But since I am trea∣ting
of <HI>Honesty,</HI> I desire to do it, as I say above,
honestly, according to the genuine Signification of
the Thing.</P>
<P>Neither shall I examine, whether Honesty be
a natural or an acquired Virtue, whether a Ha∣bit,
or a Quality, whether inherent or accidental;
all the philosophical Part of it I chuse to omit.</P>
<P>Neither shall I examine it, as it extends to
Spirituals, and looks towards Religion; if we en∣quire
about Honesty towards God, I readily al∣low
all Men are born Knaves, Villains, Thieves,
and Murtherers, and nothing but the restraining
Power of Providence witholds us all from shew∣ing
our selves such, on all Occasions.</P>
<P>No Man can be just to his Maker; if he could,
all our Creeds and Confessions, Litanies and Sup∣plications,
were ridiculous Contradictions and
Impertinences; inconsistent with themselves, and
with the whole Tenor of human Life.</P>
<P>In all the ensuing Discourse therefore, I am to
be understood of <HI>Honesty,</HI> as it regards Mankind
among themselves, as it looks from one Man to
another, in those necessary Parts of Man's Life,
his Conversation and Negotiation, Trusts, Friend∣ships,
and all the Incidents of human Affairs.</P>
<P>The Plainness I profess, both in Style and
Method, seems to me to have some suitable Ana∣logy
to the Subject, <HI>Honesty;</HI> and therefore, is ab∣solutely
necessary to be strictly follow'd. And I
must own, I am the better reconcil'd, on this very
Account, to a natural Infirmity of homely plain
Writing; in that I think the Plainness of Ex∣pression,
which I am condemn'd to, will give no
Disadvantage to my Subject, since <HI>Honesty</HI> shews
the most beautiful, and the more like <HI>Honesty,</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="43"/>
when Artifice is dismiss'd, and she is honestly seen
by her own Light only; likewise the same Since∣rity
is required in the Reader; and he that reads
this Essay without <HI>Honesty,</HI> will never understand
it right: <HI>She must, I say, be view'd by her own Light.</HI>
If Prejudice, Partiality, or private Opinions stand
in the Way, <HI>the Man's a reading Knave,</HI> he is not
honest to the Subject; and upon such an one all
the Labour is lost; this Work is of no Use to
him, and by my Consent, the Bookseller should
give him his Money again.</P>
<P>If any Man, from his private ill Nature, takes
Exceptions at me, poor, wild, wicked, <HI>Robinsoe
Crusoe,</HI> for prating of such Subjects as this is,
and shall call either my Sins, or Misfortunes to Re∣membrance,
in Prejudice of what he reads; suppo∣sing
me thereby unqualify'd to defend so noble a
Subject as this of <HI>Honesty,</HI> or at least to handle it <HI>ho∣nestly:</HI>
I take the Freedom to tell such, that those
very wild wicked Doings and Mistakes of mine,
render me the properest Man alive to give War∣ning
to others, as <HI>the Man that has been sick is half
a Physician.</HI> Besides, the Confession which I all
along make of my early Errors, and which Provi∣dence,
you see, found me Leisure enough to re∣pent
of, and I hope, gave me Assistance to do it
effectually; assists to qualify me for the present Un∣dertaking,
as well to recommend that Rectitude
of Soul, which I call <HI>Honesty</HI> others, as to warn
those who are subject to mistake it, either in
themselves or others: Heaven it self receives those
who sincerely repent, into the same State of Ac∣ceptance,
as if they had not sinn'd at all, and so
should we also.</P>
<Q><L>They who repent, and their ill Lives amend,</L>
<L>Stand next to those who never did offend.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="28" REF="44"/>
Not do I think a Man ought to be afraid or
asham'd to own and acknowledge his Follies and
Mistakes, but rather to think it a Debt which <HI>Ho∣nesty</HI>
obliges him to pay: Besides, our Infirmities
and Errors, to Which all Men are equally subject,
when recovered from, leave such Impressions be∣hind
them, on those who sincerely repent of them,
that they are always the forwardest to accuse and
reproach themselves: No Man need advise them,
or lead them; and this gives the greatest Disco∣very
of the Honesty of the Man's Heart, and Sin∣cerity
of Principles. Some People tell us, they
think they need not make any open Acknowledg∣ment
of their Follies; and 'tis a Cruelty to exact
it of them; that they could rather dye than sub∣mit
to it; that their Spirits are too great for it;
that they are more afraid to come to such publick
Confessions and Recognitions, than they would be
to meet a Cannon Bullet, or to face an Enemy:
But this is a poor mistaken Piece of false Bravery;
all Shame is Cowardise, as an eminent Poet tells
us, That all Courage is Fear, the bravest Spirit
is the best qualify'd for a Penitent; 'tis a strange
Thing that we should not be asham'd to offend,
but should be asham'd to repent; not afraid to
un, but afraid to confess. This very Thought
extorted the following Lines from a Friend of
mine, with whom I discoursed upon this Head.</P>
<Q><L>Among the worst of Cowards let him be nam'd,</L>
<L>Who having sinn'd's afraid to be asham'd;</L>
<L>And to mistaken Courage he's betray'd,</L>
<L>Who having sinn'd's asham'd to be afraid.</L></Q>
<P>But to leave the Point of Courage and Cowar∣dise
in our repenting of our Offences, I bring it
back to the very Point I am upon; namely that of
<PB N="29" REF="45"/>
<HI>Honesty.</HI> A Man cannot be truly an honest Man,
without acknowledging the Mistakes he has made;
particularly, without acknowledging the Wrong
done to his Neighbour; and why pray is Justice
less required in his Acknowledgment to his Maker?
He then that will be honest, must dare to con∣fess
he has been a Knave; for as above, speaking
of our Behaviour to God, we have been all
Knaves, and all dishonest; and if we come to
speak strictly, perhaps it would hold in our Be∣haviour
to one another also; for, Where's the
Man that is not chargeable by some or other of his
Neighbours, or by himself, with doing Wrong,
with some Oppression or Injury, either of the
Tongue, or of the Hands.</P>
<P>I might enlarge here upon the Honesty of the
Tongue, a Thing some People, who call them∣selves
very honest Men, keep a very slender Guard
upon, I mean, as to Evil-speaking; and of all
Evil-speaking, that worst Kind of it, the spea∣king
hard and unjust Things of one another.</P>
<P>This is certainly intended by the Command
of God, which is so express and emphatick, <HI>Thou
shalt not bear false Witness against thy Neighbour;</HI> at
least that Part which is what we call Slander, rai∣sing
an injurious and false Charge upon the Cha∣racter
and Conduct of our Neighbour, and sprea∣ding
it for Truth.</P>
<P>But this is not all; that Honesty I am speaking
of respects all Detraction, all outrageous As∣saults
of the Tongue; Reproach is as really a Part
of Dishonesty, as Slander; and tho' not so aggra∣vated
in Degree, yet 'tis the same in Kind.</P>
<P>There is a Kind of Murther that may be com∣mitted
with the Tongue, that is in its Na∣ture
as cruel as that of the Hand: This can
<PB N="30" REF="46"/>
never be the Practice of an honest Man; Nay, he
that practises it cannot be an honest Man.</P>
<P>But perhaps I may come to this again, but I must
go back to explain my self upon the Subject a lit∣tle
farther in the General, and then you shall hear
more of me, as to the Particulars.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Of HONESTY in General.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Have always observ'd, that however
few the real honest Men are, yet e∣very
Man thinks himself, and pro∣claims
himself an honest Man. Ho∣nesty,
like Heaven, has all Mens good Word, and
all Men pretend to a Share of it: So general is the
Claim, that like a Jest which is spoil'd by the Re∣petition,
'tis grown of no value for a Man <HI>to
swear by his Faith,</HI> which is in its original Mean∣ing,
<HI>by his Honesty,</HI> and ought to be understood
so.</P>
<P>Like Heaven too, 'tis little understood by those
who pretend most to it, 'tis too often squar'd ac∣cording
to Mens private Interest, tho' at the same
Time the Latitude which some Men give them∣selves,
is inconsistent with its Nature.</P>
<P>Honesty is a general Probity of Mind, an Apti∣tude
to Act justly and honourably in all Cases, re∣ligious
and civil, and to all Persons superiour or
inferiour; neither is Ability or Disability to act
so, any Part of the Thing it self in this Sense.</P>
<P>It may be distinguish'd into Justice and Equity,
or if you will, into Debt and Honour; for both
make up but one Honesty.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="47"/>
Exact Justice is a Debt to all our Fellow-Crea∣tures;
and honourable, generous Justice is deriv'd
from that golden Rule, <HI>Quod tibi fieri non vis al∣teri
ne fe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eris;</HI> and all this put together, makes up
Honesty: Honour indeed is a higher Word for it,
but 'tis the same Thing, and
<Q><L>—Differs from Justice only in the Name,</L>
<L>For Honesty and Honour are the same.</L></Q></P>
<P>This Honesty is of so qualifying a Nature,
that 'tis the most Denominative of all possible
Virtues: An <HI>Honest Man</HI> is the best Title can be
given in the World; all other Titles are empty
and ridiculous without it, and no Title can be
really scandalous if this remain. 'Tis the capital
Letter, by which a Man's Character will be known,
when private Qualities and Accomplishments are
Worm-eaten by Time; without it a Man can
neither be a Christian or a Gentleman: A Man may
be a poor honest Man, an unfortunate honest Man;
but a Christian Knave, or a Gentleman Knave, is
a Contradiction: A Man forfeits his Character
and his Family by Knavery; and his Escutcheon
ought to have a particular Blot, like that of Ba∣stardy.
When a Gentleman loses his Honesty, he
ceases to be a Gentleman, commences Rake from
that Minute, and ought to be us'd like one.</P>
<P>Honesty has such a general Character in the
Minds of Men, that the worst of Men, who nei∣ther
practise or pretend to any Part of it, will
yet value it in others; no Man ever cou'd be so
out of Love with it, as to desire his Posterity
should be without it; nay, such is the Veneration
all Men have for it, that the general Blessing of a
Father to his Son, is <HI>Pray, God make thee an honest
Man.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="48"/>
Indeed so general is the Value of it, and so well
known, that it seems needless to say any Thing in
behalf of it. So far as it is found upon Earth, so
much of the first Rectitude of Nature, and of the
Image of God, seems to be restor'd to Man∣kind.</P>
<P>The greatest Mischief which to me seems to
attend this Virtue, like the Thorn about the
Rose, which pricks the Finger of those who med∣dle
with it, is <HI>Pride:</HI> 'Tis a hard Thing for a
Man to be very honest, and not be proud of it;
and tho' he who is really honest, has, as we say,
something to be proud of, yet I take his Honesty to
be in a great deal of Danger, who values himself
too much upon it.</P>
<P>True honest Honesty, if I may be allow'd such
an Expression, has the least Relation to Pride of
any View in the World; 'tis all simple, plain, ge∣nuine,
and sincere; and if I hear a Man boast of his
Honesty, I cannot help having some Fears for him,
at least, that 'tis sickly and languishing.</P>
<P>Honesty is a little tender Plant, not known to
all who have Skill in Simples, Thick sow'd, <HI>as they
say,</HI> and Thin come up; 'tis nice of Growth, it
seldom thrives in a very fat Soil; and yet a very poor
Ground too is apt to starve it, unless it has taken
very good Root; when it once takes to a Piece of
Ground, it will never be quite destroy'd; it may
be choak'd with the Weeds of Prosperity, and
sometimes 'tis so scorcht up with the Droughts of
Poverty and Necessity, that it seems as if it were
quite dead and gone; but it always revives upon
the least mild Weather; and if some Showers of
Plenty fall, it makes full Reparation for the Loss the
Gardener had in his Crop.</P>
<P>There is an ugly Weed, call'd <HI>Cunning,</HI> which
is very pernicious to it, and which particularly
<PB N="33" REF="49"/>
injures it, by hiding it from our Discorery, and
making it hard to find: This is so like Honesty,
that many a Man has been deceiv'd with it, and
have taken one for t'other in the Market: Nay,
I have heard of some, who have planted this <HI>wild
Honesty,</HI> as we may call it, <HI>in their own Ground,</HI>
have made Use of it in their Friendships and Dea∣lings,
and thought it had been the true Plant,
but they always loft Credit by it: And that was
not the worst; neither; for they had the Loss who
dealt with them, and who chaffered for a Counter∣feit
Commodity; and we find many deceived so
still, which is the Occasion there is such an Out∣cry
about false Friends, and about Sharping and
Tricking in Mens ordinary Dealings in the World.</P>
<P>This true Honesty too has some little Difference
in it, according to the Soil or Climate in which
it grows, and your Simplers have had some Dis∣putes
about the Sorts of it; Nay, there have been
great Heats about the several Kinds of this Plant,
which grows in different Countries, and some call
that <HI>Honesty,</HI> which others say, is not; as parti∣cularly
they say, There is a Sort of Honesty in
my Country, <HI>Yorkshire Honesty,</HI> which differs very
much from that which is found in these southern
Parts about <HI>London:</HI> Then there is a Sort of <HI>Scots</HI>
Honesty, which they say is a meaner Sort than
that of <HI>Yorkshire:</HI> And in <HI>New England,</HI> I have
heard they have a kind of Honesty, which is
worse than the <HI>Scotish,</HI> and little better than the
wild Honesty, call'd <HI>Cunning,</HI> which I mention'd
before. On the other hand, they tell us, that in
some Parts of <HI>Asia,</HI> at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> and at <HI>Constantino∣ple,</HI>
the <HI>Turks</HI> have a better Sort of Honesty than
any of us. I am sorry, our <HI>Turkey</HI> Company have
not imported some of it, that we might try whe∣ther
it would thrive here or no. 'Tis a little odd
<PB N="34" REF="50"/>
to me, it should grow to such a Perfection in <HI>Tu∣key,</HI>
because it has always been observ'd to thrive
best, where it is sow'd with a Sort of Grain
call'd <HI>Religion:</HI> Indeed they never thrive in these
Parts of the World, so well apart, as they do
together. And far this Reason, I must own, I have
found that <HI>Scots</HI> Honesty, as above, to be of a very
good Kind. How 'tis in <HI>Turkey,</HI> I know not;
for in all my Travels, I never set my Foot in
the Grand Seignior's Dominions.</P>
<P>But to wave Allegories, Disputes about what
is, or is not Honesty, are dangerous to Honesty
it self; for no Case can be doubtful, which does
not border upon the Frontiers of Dishonesty; and
he that resolves not to be drowned, had best ne∣ver
come near the Brink of the Water.</P>
<P>That Man who will do nothing but what is barely
honest, is in great Danger. 'Tis certainly just for me
to do every Thing the Law justifies; but if I should
only square my Actions by what is literally law∣ful,
I must throw every Debtor, tho' he be poor,
in Prison, and never release him till he has paid the
uttermost Farthing: I must hang every Malefa∣ctor
without Mercy, I must exact the Penalty of
every, Bond, and the Forfeiture of every Inden∣ture:
In short, I must be uneasy to all Mankind,
and make them so to me; and in a Word, be a
very Knave too, as well as a Tyrant; for Cruelty
is not Honesty.</P>
<P>Therefore, the sovereign Judge of every Man's
Honesty has laid us down a general Rule, to
which all the Particulars are resolved, <HI>Quod tibi
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n vis, alte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i ne feceris.</HI> This is a Part of
that Honesty I am treating of, and which indeed
is the more essential of the two; this is the Test
of Behaviour, and the grand Article to have Re∣course
to, when Laws are silent.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="51"/>
I have heard some Men argue, that they are
not bound to any such Considerations of the In∣digence
of Persons, as lead to Concessions of Time,
or Compositions with them for Debts; that 'tis
all <HI>ex gratia,</HI> or the Effects of Policy, because Cir∣cumstances
lead them to judge it better to take
what they can get, than lose the Whole.</P>
<P>Speaking of the Letter of the Law, I allow that
they may be in the right.</P>
<P>On the other hand, a Man who gives a Bond
for a Debt, pleads, he is answerable for no more
than the Law will force him to; that is, he may
defend a Suit, stand out to the last Extremity,
and at last keep out of the Way, so as not to have
Judgment or Execution serv'd on him; he may
secure his Estate from the Execution, as well as
his Person, and so never pay the Debt at all; and
yet in the Eye of the Law be an honest Man; and
this Part of legal literal Honesty is supported on∣ly
by the other, namely, the cruel Part; for real∣ly
such a Man, speaking in the Sense of common
Justice, is a Knave; he ought to act according to
the true Intent and Meaning of his Obligation, and
in the Right of a Debtor to a Creditor, which is
to pay him his Money when it became due, not
stand out to the last, because he cannot be forc'd
to it sooner.</P>
<P>The Laws of the Country indeed allow such
Actions as the Laws of Conscience can by no
Means allow, as in this Case of the Creditor
suing for his Debt, and the Debtor not paying it
till he is forced by Law. The Argument made
Use of to vindicate the Morality of such a Pra∣ctice,
stands thus:</P>
<P>If a Man trusts me with his Money or Goods,
upon my common Credit, or upon my Word, he
takes me for his Money, and depends both
<PB N="36" REF="52"/>
upon my Ability and my Honesty; but if he
comes and demands my, Bond, he quits his De∣pendence
upon my Honesty, and rakes the Law
for his Security; so that the Language of such an
Action is, He will have a Bond, that it may be
in his Power, to make me pay him, whether I
will or no; and as for my Honesty, he'll have no∣thing
to do with it: What Relief then I can have
against this Bond, by the same Law, to which
the Person refers himself, is as legal an Action on
my Side, as the other Man's suing for his own,
is on his.</P>
<P>And thus the Letter of the Law will ruine the
Honesty of both Debitor and Creditor, and yet
both shall be justify'd too.</P>
<P>But if I may give my Opinion in this Case, nei∣ther
of these are the honest Man I am speaking of;
for Honesty does not consist of Negatives; and
'tis not sufficient to do my Neighbour no perso∣nal
Injury in the strict Sense and Letter of the Law;
but I am bound, where Cases and Circumstances
make other Measures reasonable, to have such Re∣gard
to these Cases and Circumstances, as Rea∣son
requires. Thus to begin with the Creditor
to the Debtor, Reason requires, that where a
Man is reduc'd to Extremities, he should not be
destroy'd for Debt; and what's unreasonable can∣not
be honest.</P>
<P>Debt is no capital Crime, nor ever was; and
stgrving Men in Prison, a Punishment worse than
the Gallows, seems to be a Thing so severe, as
it ought not to be in the Power of a Creditor
to inflict it: The Laws of God never tolerated
such a Method of treating Debtors, as we have
since thought proper, I won't say honest, to put
in Practice: But since the Politicks of the Nation
have left the Debtor so much at Mercy by the
<PB N="37" REF="53"/>
Letter of the Law, 'tis honest with Respect to
the Law, to proceed so; yet Compassion is in
this Case thought reasonable, <HI>Why shou'dst thou
take his Bed from under him?</HI> says the Text; which
implies, 'tis unnatural and unreasonable.</P>
<P>I have heard some Men insist upon it, that if
a Man be sued wrongfully at Law, he ought ra∣ther
to submit to the Injury, than to oppose the
Wrong, by the same Law; and yet I never found
those Gentlemen so passive in Matters of Law,
but they would sue a Debtor at Law, if they could
not otherwise obtain their Right.</P>
<P>I confess, I cannot blame them for the last,
but I blame them for pretending to the first:
I am not arguing against recovering a just Debt
by a just Law, where the Person is able, but un∣willing
to be honest: But I think, pursuing the
Debtor to all Extremities, to the turning his Wife
and Children into the Street, express'd in the
Scripture by, <HI>Taking his Bed from under him;</HI> and
by keeping the Debtor in Prison, when really he
is not able to pay it; there is something of Cruel∣ty
in it, and the honest Man, I am speaking of,
can never do it.</P>
<P>But some may object, if I must serve all Man∣kind,
as I would be serv'd in like Case, then I
must relieve every Beggar, and release every poor
Debtor; for if I was a Beggar, I would be re∣liev'd;
and if I was in Prison, I would be releas'd;
and so I must give away all I have. This is inver∣ting
the Argument; for the Meaning is in the
Negative still, Do not to another any Thing, or
put no Hardship upon another, which you would
not allow to be just, if you were in their
Case.</P>
<P>Honesty is Equity, every Man is Lord Chan∣cellor
to himself; and if he would consult that
<PB N="38" REF="54"/>
Principle within him, would find Reason as fair
an Advocate for his Neighbour, as for him∣self:
But I proceed.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Of the Tryal of HONESTY.</HEAD>
<P>N-Ecessity makes an honest Man a Knave;
and if the World was to be the Judge,
according to the common receiv'd No∣tion,
there would not be an honest poor
Man left alive.</P>
<P>A rich Man is an honest Man, <HI>no Thanks to
him;</HI> for he would be a double Knave to cheat
Mankind, when he had no Need of it: He has
no Occasion to press upon his Integrity, nor so
much as to touch upon the Borders of Dishone∣sty.
Tell me of a Man, that is a very honest
Man; for he pays every Body punctually, runs
into no body's Debt, does no Man any Wrong;
very well, What Circumstances is he in? Why,
he has a good Estate, a fine yearly Income, and
no Business to do. The Devil must have full Pos∣session
of this Man, if he shoud be a Knave; for
no Man commits Evil for the Sake of it; even the
Devil himself has some farther Design in Sinning,
than barely the wicked Part of it. No Man is
so hardned in Crimes, as to commit them for the
meer Pleasure of the Fact; there is always some
Vice gratify'd; Ambition, Pride, or Avarice,
make rich Men Knaves, and Necessity, the Poor:
But to go on with this rich honest Man; his
Neighbour a thriving Merchant, and whose Ho∣nesty
had as untainted a Character, as he can
<PB N="39" REF="55"/>
pretend to, has a rich Ship cast away, or a Fa∣ctor
Abroad broke in his Debt, and his Bills
come back protested, and he fails, is fain to ab∣scond,
and make a Composition: Our rich ho∣nest
Man flies out upon him presently, he is a
Knave, a Rogue, and don't pay People what he
owes them; and we should have a Law, That
he that runs into Debt farther than he is able to
pay, should be hang'd; and the like. If the poor
Man is laid Hold on by some Creditor, and put
in Prison; ay, there let him lye, he deserves it;
'twill be an Example to keep others from the
like; and now when all is done, this broken Mer∣chant
may be as honest a Man as the other.</P>
<P>You say, you are an honest Man, How do you
know it? Did you ever want Bread, and had
you Neighbour's Loaf in your Keeping, and
would starve rather than eat it? Was you ever ar∣rested,
and being not able by your self or Friends,
to make Peace with your Plaintiff, and at the
same Time having another Man's Money in your
Cash Chest, committed to your Keeping, suffer'd
your self to be carry'd to Jayl, rather than break
Bulk, and break in upon your Trust. God him∣self
has declar'd, That the Power of Extremity
is irresistible, <HI>and that so,</HI> as to our Integrity,
that he has bid us not <HI>despise the Thief</HI> that steals
in such a Case; not that the Man is less a Thief,
or the Fact less dishonest: But the Text is most
remarkably worded for Instruction, in this Point;
Don't you despise the Man; But remember, if
you were driven to the same Exigence, you would
be the same Man, and do the same Thing, tho'
now you fancy your Principle so good; therefore,
whatever his Crime may be as to God, don't re∣proach
him with it here; but you that think you
stand, <HI>take heed, least you fall.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="56"/>
I am of the Opinion, that I could state a Cir∣cumstance,
in which there is not one Man in the
World would be honest: Necessity is above the
Power of human Nature; and for Providence
to suffer a Man to fall into that Necessity, is to
suffer him to sin; because Nature is not furnish'd
with Power to defend it self, nor is Grace itself
able to fortify the Mind against it.</P>
<P>What shall we say to five Men in a Boat at Sea,
without Provision, calling a Council together,
and resolving to kill one of themselves for the
others to feed on, and eat him? With what Face
could the four look up, and crave a Blessing on
that Meat? With what Heart give Thanks after
it? And yet this has been done by honest Men;
and I believe, the honestest Man in the World
might be forc'd to it; yet here is no Manner of
Pretence, but Necessity, to palliate the Crime.
If it be argued 'twas the Loss of one Man to
save the Four, 'tis answered, But what Authority
to make him die to save their Lives? How came
the Man to owe them such a Debt? 'Twas Rob∣bery
and Murder; 'twas robbing him of his Life,
which was his, Property to preserve mine; 'tis
Murder, by taking away the Life of an innocent
Man; and at best 'twas doing Evil that Good
may come, which is expressly forbidden.</P>
<P>But there is a Kind of Equity pleaded in this
Case; generally when Men are brought to such a
Pass, they cast Lots who shall be the Man, and
the voluntary Consent of the Party makes it law∣ful
(God himself being suppos'd to determine who
shall be the Man) which I deny; for it is in no
Man's Power legally to consent to such a Lot;
no Man has a Right to give away his own Life;
he may forfeit it to the Law, and loose it; but
that's a Crime against himself, as well as against
<PB N="41" REF="57"/>
the Law; and the four Men might by our Law have
been try'd and hang'd for Murder. All that can be
said is, That Necessity makes the highest Crimes
lawful, and Things Evil in their own Nature are
made practicable by it. From these Extremes
of Necessity, we come to lighter Degrees of it;
and so let us bring our honest Man to some Exieng∣cies.
He would not wrong any Man of a Farthing;
he could not sleep if he should be in any body's
Debt; and he cannot be an honest Man that can.</P>
<P>That we may see now, whether this Man's
Honesty lyes any deeper than his Neighbour's,
turn the Scale of his Fortune a little: His
Father left him a good Estate, but here comes
some Relations, and they trump up a Title to his
Lands, and serve Ejectments upon his Tenants;
and so the Man gets into Trouble, Hurry of
Business, and the Law: The extravagant Charges
of the Law sink him of all his ready Money, and
his Rents being stopp'd, the first Breach he makes
upon his Honesty (<HI>that is, by his former Rules</HI>) he
goes to a Friend to borrow Money, tells him this
Matter will be over he hopes quickly, and he
shall have his Rents to receive, and then he will
pay him again; and really he intends to do so:
But here comes a Disappointment, the Tryal
comes on, and he is cast, and his Title to the
Estate proves defective; his Father was cheated,
and he not only loses the Estate, but is call'd up∣on
for the Arrears of the Rent he has receiv'd;
and in short, the Man is undone, and has not a
Penny to buy Bread, or help himself; and besides,
this cannot pay the Money he borrowed.</P>
<P>Now, turn to his Neighbour, the Merchant,
whom he had so loudly call'd Knave, for Breaking
in his Trade, he by this Time has made up with
his Creditors, and got Abroad again; and he meets
<PB N="42" REF="58"/>
him in the Street in his dejected Circumstances,
<HI>Well,</HI> says the Merchant, <HI>and Why don't you pay
my Cousin, your old Neighbour, the Money you borrow∣ed
of him? Truly,</HI> says he, <HI>because I have lost all my
Estate, and can't pay, nay I have nothing to live on.
Well, but,</HI> returns the Merchant, <HI>Wan't you a Knave
to borrow Money, and now can't pay it? Why truly,</HI>
says the Gentleman, <HI>When I borrowed it, I really
design'd to be honest, and did not question but I should
have my Estate again, and then I had been able also,
and would have paid him to a Penny, but it has pro∣ved
otherwise; and tho' I would pay him, if I had
it, yet I am not able. Well but,</HI> says the Merchant
again, <HI>Did you not call me Knave, tho' I lost my Estate
Abroad, by unavoidable Disasters, as you have lost
yours at Home? Did you not upbraid me, because I
could not pay? I would have paid every Body, if I
could, as well as you. Why truly,</HI> says the Gentle∣man,
<HI>I was a Fool, I did not consider what it was
to be brought to Necessity, I ask you Pardon.</HI></P>
<P>Now, let's carry on this Story: The Mer∣chant
compounds with his Creditors, and paying
every one a just Proportion, as far as 'twill go,
gets himself discharg'd; and being bred to Busi∣ness,
and industrious, falls into Trade, again, and
raises himself to good Circumstances; and at last,
a lucky Voyage, or some Hit of Trade, sets him
above the World again: The Man remembring
his former Debts, and retaining his Principle
of Honesty, calls his old Creditors together; and
tho' he was formerly discharg'd from them all, vo∣luntarily
pays them the Remainder of their Debts.
The Gentleman being bred to no Business, and
his Fortune desperate, goes Abroad, and gets in∣to
the Army, and behaving himself well, is made
an Officer; and still rising by his Merit, becomes
a great Man, but in his new Condition troubles
<PB N="43" REF="59"/>
not his Head with his former Debts in his native
Country, but settles in the Court and Favour of
the Prince, under whom he has made his Fortunes,
and there sets up for the same honest Man he did
before.</P>
<P>I think I need not ask which of these two are
the honest Man, any more than which was the
honest Penitent, the Pharisee or the Publican.</P>
<P>Honesty, like Friendship, is try'd in Affliction;
and he that cries out loudest against those who in
the Time of this Tryal are forc'd to give Ground,
would perhaps yield as far in the like Shock of
Misfortune.</P>
<P>To be honest when Peace and Plenty flows
upon our Hands, is owing to the Blessing of our
Parents; but to be honest, when Circumstances
grow narrow, Relations turbulent and quarrel∣some,
when Poverty stares at us, and the World
threatens; this Blessing is from Heaven, and can
only be supported from thence. God Al∣mighty
is very little beholding to them, who will
serve him just as long as he feeds them. 'Twas
a strong Argument the Devil used in that Dia∣logue
between Sathan and his Maker about <HI>Job.
Yes he is a mighty good Man, and a mighty just
Man, and well he may, while you give him every Thing
he wants: I wou'd serve you my self, and be as true
to you as</HI> Job, <HI>if you wou'd be as kind and as boun∣tiful
to me, as you are to him: But now, do but lay
your Finger on him; do but stop your Hand a little, and
cut him short; strip him a little, and make him like
one of those poor Fellows that now bow to him, and you
will quickly see your good Man be like other Men; nay,
the Passion he will be in at his Losses, will make him
curse you to your Face.</HI> 'Tis true, the Devil was
mistaken in the Man, but the Argument had a
great deal of Probability in it, and the Moral may
<PB N="44" REF="60"/>
be drawn, both from the Argument and from the
Consequences.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. That 'tis an easy Thing to maintain the Cha∣racter
of Honesty and Uprightness, when a Man
has no Business to be in employ'd in, and no Want
to press him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. That when Exigences and Distresses pinch
a Man, then is the Time to prove the Honesty of
his Principle.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The prosperous honest Man can only by boa∣sting
tell the World he is honest, but the distress'd
and ruin'd honest Man hears other People tell
him he is honest.</P>
<P>In this Case therefore, since Allowance must
be made for human Infirmities, we are to di∣stinguish
between an Accident and a Practice. I
am not pleading to encourage any Man to make
no Scruple of trespassing upon his Honesty in Time
of Necessity: But I cannot condemn every Man
for a Knave, who by unusual Pressures, Straits,
Difficulties, or other Temptation, has been left
to slip, and do an ill Action, as we call it,
which perhaps this Person would never have
stoop'd to, if the Exigence had not been too
great for his Resolution. The Scripture says of
<HI>David, He was a Man after God's own Heart;</HI> and
yet we have several Things recorded of him,
which, according the modern Way of censuring
People in this Age, would have given him the
Character of a very ill Man: But I conceive, the
Testimony of <HI>David</HI>'s Uprightness, given us so
authentickly from the Scripture, is given from
this very Rule, That the Inclination of his Heart,
and the general Bent of his Practice, was to serve
and obey his Great Sovereign Benefactor, how∣ever,
<PB N="45" REF="61"/>
human Frailty, back'd with Extremities of
Circumstances, or powerful Temptations, might
betray him, to commit Actions which he would
not otherwise have done. The Falling into a Crime,
will not denominate a Man dishonest; for <HI>huma∣num
est errare.</HI> The Character of a Man ought
to be taken from the general Tenour of his Be∣haviour,
and from his allowed Practice. <HI>David</HI>
took the <HI>Shew-Bread</HI> from the Priests, which it
was not lawful for him to eat. <HI>David</HI> knew, that
God, who commanded the <HI>Shew-Bread</HI> should not
be eaten, had however commanded him by the Law
of Nature, not to be starv'd; and therefore, press'd
by his Hunger, he ventures upon the Commandment.
And the Scripture is very remarkable in expressing it,
David <HI>when he was an hungry:</HI> And the Occasion for
which our Blessed Lord himself quoted this Text,
is very remarkable. <HI>viz.</HI> to prove, that Things
otherwise unlawful, may be made lawful by Ne∣cessity,
<HI>Matth.</HI> xii. 4.</P>
<P>Another Time, <HI>David</HI> in his Passion resolves
the Destruction of <HI>Nabal</HI> and all his Family,
which, without Doubt, was a great Sin; and
the Principle which he went upon, <HI>to wit,</HI> Re∣venge
for his churlish and saucy Answer to him,
was still a greater Sin; but the Temptation back'd
by the Strength of his Passion, had the better of him
at that Time: And this upright honest Man had
murder'd <HI>Nabal</HI> and all his House, if God had
not prevented him.</P>
<P>Many Instances of like Nature the Scripture
has left upon Record, giving Testimony to the
Character of good Men, from the general Practice
and Bent of their Hearts, without leaving any
Reproach upon them for particular Failings, tho'
those Sins have been extraordinary provoking, and
in their Circumstances scandalous enough.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="62"/>
If any Man would be so weak as from hence
to draw Encouragement to allow himself in easy
Trespasses upon his Honesty, on the Pretence of
Necessities, let him go on with me to the fur∣ther
End of this Observation, and find room for
it if he can.</P>
<P>If ever the honest Man I speak of, by what∣soever
Exigence or Weakness, thus slips from the
Principle of his Integrity, he never fails to ex∣press
his own Dislike of it; he acknowledges up∣all
Occasions, both to God and to Man, his
having been overcome, and been prevail'd upon
to do, what he does not approve of; he is too
much asham'd of his own Infirmity, to pretend
to vindicate the Action, and he certainly is re∣stor'd
to the first Regulation of his Principles, as
soon as the Temptation is over. No Man is
fonder to accuse him than he is to accuse himself,
and he has always upon him the sincere Marks
of a Penitent.</P>
<P>'Tis plain from hence, that the Principle of
the Man's Integrity is not destroy'd, however;
he may have fallen, tho' seven times a Day;
and I must while I live reckon him for an honest
Man.</P>
<P>Nor am I going about to suppose, that the Ex∣tremities
and Exigencies which have press'd Men
of the best Principles, to do what at another time
they would not do, make those Actions become
less Sinful, either in their own Nature or Circum∣stances.
The Guilt of a Crime with respect to
its being a Crime, <HI>viz.</HI> an Offence against God, is
not removed by the Circumstances of Necessity.
It is without Doubt a Sin for me to steal ano∣ther
Man's Food, tho' it was to supply Starving
Nature; for how do I know whether he whose
Food I steal may not be in as much Danger of
<PB N="47" REF="63"/>
Starving for want of it, as I; and <HI>if not,</HI> 'tis taking
to my own Use what I have no Right to, and
taking it by Force or Fraud; and the Question
is not as to the Right or Wrong, whether I have
a Necessity to eat this Man's Bread or no; but
whether it be his or my own? If it be his, and
not my own, I cannot do it without a manifest
Contempt of God's Law, and breaking the
Eighth Article of it, <HI>Thou shalt not Steal.</HI> Thus
as to God, the Crime is evident, let the Necessity
be what it will.</P>
<P>But when we are considering human Nature
subjected by the Consequences of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Trans∣gression,
to Frailty and Infirmity; and regarding
things from Man to Man, the Exigencies and Ex∣tremities
of streightned Circumstances seem to
me to be most prevailing Arguments, why the
Denomination of a Man's general Character ought
not, <HI>by his fellow Mortals (subject to the same
Infirmities)</HI> to be gathered from his Mistakes, his
Errors or Failings, no not from his being guilty
of any extraordinary Sin, but from the Manner
and Method of his Behaviour. Does he go on
to commit Frauds, and make a Practice of his
Sin? Is it a Distress? Is it a Storm of Affliction,
and Poverty has driven him upon the Lee Shore
of Temptation? Or is the Sin the Port he steer'd
for? A Ship may by Stress of Weather be driven
upon Sands and dangerous Places, and the Skill
of the Pilot not be blameable; but he that runs
against the Wind, and without any Necessity,
upon a Shelve which he sees before him, must do
do it on purpose to destroy the Vessel, and ruine
the Voyage.</P>
<P>In short, if no Man can be call'd honest, but
he who is never overcome, to fall into any Breach
of this Rectitude of Life; none but he who
<PB N="48" REF="64"/>
is sufficiently fortified against all Possibility of
being tempted by prospects, or driven by Distress,
to make any Trespass upon his Integrity; Woe be
unto me that Write, and to most that Read, where
shall we find the honest Man?</P>
<P>The Scripture is particularly expressive of this
in the <HI>The Righteous Man falleth seven times
a Day, and riseth again.</HI> Why, this is very strange,
if a Man come, to commit seven Crimes in a Day,
that is, many, for the Meaning is Indefinite, can
this be an honest Man?: What says the World of
him? Hang him, he is a Knave, a Rascal, a Dis∣honest
Fellow; this is the Judgment of Men: But
in the Judgment of Scripture this may be a
Righteous Man.</P>
<P>The main Design, of this Head and the proper
Application of it is, to tell us we ought not be
too hasty to Brand our Brother for his Sins,
his Infirmities or Misfortunes, snce he that is Dis∣honest
in your Eyes, by a casual or other Crime
which he Commits, may rise from that Disaster
by a sincere Repentance, and be to morrow an
honester Man than thy self in the Eyes of his
Maker.</P>
<P>But here I am assaulted with another censo∣rious
honest Man; here you talk of falling to
Day, and rising again to Morrow; Sinning and
Repenting; why here is a Fellow has cheated me
of 500 <HI>l.</HI> and he comes canting to me of his Re∣pentance,
tells me he hopes God has forgiven
him; and it would be hard for me to call to Re∣membrance
what God has wip'd out; he is
heartily sorry for the Fault, and the like, and
begs my Pardon, that is, begs my Estate indeed:
For what's all this to my Money, let him pay me
and I'll forgive him too; God may forgive him
the Sin, but that's nothing to my Debt.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="65"/>
Why truly, in Answer to this in Part, you are
in the Right if the Man be able to make you any
Satisfaction, and does not do it; for I question
not, but every Trespass of this Nature requires
Restitution, as well as Repentance; Restitution as
far as the possible Power of the Party extends; and
if the last be not found, the first is not likely to
be sincere.</P>
<P>But if the Man, either is not able to make you
any Restitution at all, or does make you Restituti∣on
to the utmost of his Capacity, and then comes
and says as before; then the Poor Man is in
the Right, and you in the Wrong; for I make no
Question likewise to affirm, and could prove it by
unanswerable Arguments, <HI>He may be an Honest Man
who cannot pay his Debts, but he cannot be an Honest
Man who can, and does not.</HI></P>
<P>Innumerable Accidents reduce Men from Plen∣tiful
Fortunes to mean and low Circumstances;
some procur'd by their own Vices and Intempe∣rance,
some by Infirmities, Ignorance, and meer
want of Judgment to manage their Affairs:
Some by the Frauds and Cheats of other Men,
some by meer Casualty and unavoidable Acci∣dents,
wherein the Sovereignty of Providence
shews us, that the Race is not to the Swift, or
the Battle to the Strong, or Riches to Men of
Understanding.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Some by Vices and Intemperance are re∣duc'd
to Poverty and Distress: Our Honest Man
cannot fall in the Misfortunes of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Class, be∣cause
there the very Poverty is a Sin, being produc'd
from a sinful Cause. As its far from being al∣low'd,
as an Excuse to a Murtherer, to say he
was in Drink, because it is excusing a Crime
with a Crime: So for a Man to ruin his For∣tunes,
as the Prodigal in the Gospel, with riot∣ous
<PB N="50" REF="66"/>
Living, all the Effects are wicked and dis∣honest,
as they partake of the Dishonesty of the
Cause from whence they proceed: For he cannot
be an honest Man, who wants wherewith to pay
his Debts, after having spent what should have
discharg'd them, in Luxury and Debauches.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Some by Ignorance and want of Judg∣ment
to manage their Affairs, are brought to
Poverty and Distress; these may be honest Men,
notwithstanding their Weakness, for I won't un∣dertake
that none of our honest Men shall be
Fools: 'Tis true the good Man, is the wise Man,
as to the main Part of Wisdom, which is in∣cluded
in his Piety, but many a Religious Man
who would not do any Wrong wilfully to his
Neighbour, is oblig'd at last to injure both his
own Family, and other People's, for want of Dis∣cretion
to guide him in his Affairs, and to judge for
himself: and therefore I dare not Tax all our
Fools with being Knaves, nor will I say but such a
Man may be Honest. Some will say, but such
a Man should not venture into Business, which he
is not able to manage, and therefore 'twas the
Vice of his Understanding, and like the Case in
the first Article, is excusing a Fault with a
Fault.</P>
<P>I cannot allow this, for if I am askt why a
Fool ventures into Trade, I answer, because he
is a Fool, not because he is a Knave.</P>
<Q><L>If Fools could their own Ignorance discern,</L>
<L>They'd be no longer Fools, because they'd learn.</L></Q>
<P>If you would convince a Man that he wants
Discretion, you must give him Discretion to be
convinc'd: 'Till then he cannot know he has it
not, because he has it not. No Man is answerable,
<PB N="51" REF="67"/>
either to God or Man, for that which he never
was Master of: The most proper Expression
that ever I met with in this Nature, was of a
certain Ideot or Natural, which a Gentleman
of my Acquaintance kept in his Family, who
being on his Death-Bed, was observ'd to be very
pensive, and much concern'd about dying; the
Gentleman sent a Minister to him, who as well
as he could to his Understanding, discoursed with
him about Death and Judgment to come; the
poor Creature who was hardly ever able to give
a rational Answer to a Question before, after
hearing him very attentively, broke out into
Tears with this Expression, <HI>That he hoped God would
not require any Thing of him, that he had not given
him Judgment to understand.</HI> Whatever it may be
as to the Soul, I am positive in the Case of human
Affairs, no Man is answerable to Man for any
more than his Discretion; Events are not in our
Power, a Man may be nicely Honest in Life, tho'
he may be weak enough in Judgment.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Some are ruin'd, and are yet merely
passive, being either defrauded and cheated by
Knaves, or plundered and rifled by Thieves, or
by immediate Casualties, as Fire, Enemies, Storms,
Floods, and the like; these are Things which nei∣ther
touch the Man's Honesty, nor his Discre∣tion.
Thus <HI>Job</HI> was by God's Permission and
the Agency of the Devil, reduc'd in a Moment
from a plentiful Estate to be as naked as he
came out of his Mother's Womb: I would fain
ask those who say, no Man can be an honest
Man if he does not pay his Debts, who paid
<HI>Job</HI>'s Debts if he own'd any, and where was his
Dishonesty, if he did not pay them? I still rea∣dily
grant that he cannot be an honest Man who
does not pay his Debts if he can; but if other∣wise,
<PB N="52" REF="68"/>
then the Words ought to be altered, and
they should say, he cannot be an honest Man
who borrows any Money, or buys any Thing up∣on
his Credit, and this cannot be true.</P>
<P>But since I have led myself into the Argument,
I cannot but make a small Digression concerning
People who fail in Trade: I conceive the greatest
Error of such is their Terror about Breaking, by
which they are tempted while their Credit is
good, tho' their Bottom be naught, to push far∣ther
in; expecting, or at least hoping, by the Pro∣fits
of some happy Voyage, or some lucky Hit,
as they call it, to retrieve their Circumstances,
and stand their Ground.</P>
<P>I must confess, I cannot vindicate the Honesty
of this; for he, who knowing his Circumstances
to be once naught, and his Bottom worn out;
ought not in Justice to enter into any Man's Debt;
for Then he Trades on their Risque, not on his
own, and yet Trades for his own Profits, not
theirs; this is not fair, because he deceives the
Creditor, who ventures his Estate on that Bot∣tom
which he supposes to be good, and the o∣ther
knows is not. Nay, tho' he really pays
this Creditor, he is not honest; for in Consci∣ence,
his former Creditors had a Right to all
his Effects, in Proportion to their Debts; and if
he really pays one all, and the rest but a Share,
'tis a Wrong to the whole.</P>
<P>I would therefore advise all Tradesmen, who
find their Circumstances declining, as soon, at
least, as they first discern themselves to be unca∣pable
of paying their Debts, if not, while yet
they can pay every one all, make a full Stop,
and call all People together; if there is enough
to pay them all, let them have it, if not, let
them have their just Shares of it; by this Means
<PB N="53" REF="69"/>
you will certainly have God's Blessing, and the
Character of an honest Man, left to begin again
with; and Creditors are often prevail'd with, in
Consideration of such a generous Honesty, to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arow back something to put such a Man in a
Posture to live again; or by further voluntary Cre∣dit
and Friendship, to uphold him. This is much
better also with respect to Interest, as well as Ho∣nesty,
than to run on to all Extremities, till the
Burthen falls too heavy, either for Debtor or
Creditor to bear: This would prevent many of
the Extremities, which, I say, puts the Honesty
of a Man to so extraordinary a Tryal.</P>
<P>An honest Principle would certainly dictate to
the Man, if it were consulted with, that when
he knows he is not able to pay, it is not lawful
for him to borrow. Taking Credit is a Promise
of Payment; a Promise of Payment is tacitly
understood, and he cannot be honest who promises
what he knows he cannot perform, as I shall
note more at large on another Head. But if the
Man be paid, yet it was not an honest Act;
'twas deceiving the Man, and making him run a
greater Risque than he knew of, and such a Risque
as he would not have run, had he known your
Circumstances and Bottom, as you do; so that
here is Deceit upon Deceit.</P>
<P>This I know is a disputed Point, and a Thing
which a great many practise, who pass for very ho∣nest
Men in the World; but I like it not the better
for that; I am very positive, that he who takes
my Goods on the Foot of his Credit, when if
he should dye the next Day, he knows his Estate
will not pay me five Shillings in the Pound;
tho' he should not dye, but does pay me at the
Time appointed, is as much guilty of a Fraud,
as if he actually robb'd my House. Credit is a
<PB N="54" REF="70"/>
receiv'd Opinion of a Man's Honesty and Abili∣ty,
his Willingness to pay, and his having where∣with
to pay; and he who wants either of these,
his Credit is same. Men won't sell their Goods
to a litigious quarrelsome Man, tho' he be never
so rich, nor to a needy Man, tho' he be never
so honest. Now, if all the World believe I
am honest and able, and I know I am not the
last, I cannot be the first, if I take their Goods
upon Credit; 'tis vain to pretend, Men Trade
upon the general Risque of Mens Appearance,
and the Credit of common Fame, and all Men
have an equal Hazard. <HI>I say no:</HI> Men may ven∣ture
their Estates in the Hands of a flourishing
Bankrupt, and he by Virtue of his yet unshaken
Credit is trusted; but he cannot be honest that
takes this Credit, because he knows his Circum∣stances
are quite otherwise than they are sup∣pos'd
to be, that the Man is deceiv'd, and he is
privy to the Deceit.</P>
<P>This Digression is not so remote from the pur∣pose,
as I expected, when I began it; the Honesty
that I am speaking of, chiefly respects Matters
of Commerce, of when Credit and Payment of
Debt are the most considerable Branches.</P>
<P>There is another Article in Trade, which
many very honest Men have made familiar to
Themselves, which yet I think, is in no Case to
be defended; and that is relating to Counterfeit
Money. Custom, before the old Money was
suppress'd in <HI>England,</HI> had prevail'd so far upon
Honesty, that I have seen some Men put all their
Brass Money among their runing Cash, to be told
over in every Sum they paid, in Order to have
somebody or other take it; I have heard many
People own they made no Scruple of it, but I
could never find them give one good Reason to
justify the Honesty of it.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="71"/>
<HI>First,</HI> They say it comes for Money, and it
ought to go so: To which I Answer, that is
just as good a Reason as this: <HI>A</HI> has cheated me,
and therefore I may Cheat <HI>B.</HI> If I have receiv∣ed
a Sum of Money for good, and knowing not
that any, of it is otherwise, offer it in Payment to
another: This is Just and Honest; but, if on this
other Man's telling it over, he returns me a Piece
of Brass or Counterfeit Money which I change
again, and afterwards knowing, this to be such,
offer the same Piece to another: I know no worse
Fraud in its Degree in the World, and I doubt
not to prove it so beyond Contradiction.</P>
<P>If the first Person did not take this Piece of
Money, it was because being both watchful and
skilful, he could discover it; and if I offer it
to another 'tis with an Expectation, that he being
either less watchful or less skillful, shall overlook
it, and so I shall make an Advantage of my
Neighbour's Ignorance, or want of Care.</P>
<P>I'll put some parallel Cases to this, to illustrate
it: Suppose a blind Man comes into a Shop to
buy Goods of me, and giving me a Guinea to
change, I shall give him the Remainder in bad Mo∣ney;
would not every Body say 'twas a barbarous
Thing? Why the other is all one, for if the Person
be ignorant of Money, he is blind as to the Point
in Hand; and nothing can be more unfair than
to take the Advantage.</P>
<P>Suppose again a young Boy, or a Servant new∣ly
entred in Trade, is sent to buy Goods, and
by his Master's Order, he asks for such a Com∣modity;
and you presuming upon the Rawness
of the Messenger, deliver a Sort of a meaner
Quality, and take the full Price of him; would
you grudge to be used scurvily for such a Trick<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Why, no less or better is Offering Brass for Silver,
<PB N="56" REF="72"/>
presuming only the want of Care or Skill in the
Receiver, shall pass it unobserv'd.</P>
<P>Ay, but says a learned Tradesman who would be
thought honester than ordinary; I always change
it again, if it be brought back: Yes Sir, so does a
Pick-Pocket give you your Handkerchief again
when you have fasten'd on him, and threaten'd him
with the Mob. The Matter in short is this; if
the Man whom you have cheated, can cheat no
Body else, then no Thanks to you; when he
comes to you, and charges the Fraud upon you,
you'll make Sat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isfaction, because if you won't,
the Law will compel you to it.</P>
<P>But if the Fraud may be carried on, as you
are manifestly willing, consenting, and instrumen∣tal
in it that it should; behold the Consequence,
your first sin against Honesty is multiplied in all
the Hands thro' whom this Piece of bad Money
knowingly so passes, till at last it happens to go
single to a poor Man that can't put it off, and
the Wrong and Injury may issue where it was
wanted to buy Bread for a starving Family.</P>
<P>All the Excuses I could ever meet with could
never satisfy me, that it can consist with Honesty,
to put Brass or Copper away for Gold or Silver,
any more than it would, to give a blind Messen∣ger
Sand instead of Sugar? or brown Bread instead
of white.</P>

<HEAD>Of HONESTY in Promises.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> <HI>Man is known by his Word, and an Ox by
his Horns,</HI> says an old <HI>English</HI> Proverb.
If I understand the true Meaning of it,
'tis, that the Honesty of a Man is known
by his punctual observing his Word, as naturally
and plainly as any Creature is known by the
most obvious Distinction. 'Tis the peculiar
Quality of an honest Man, the distinguishing
Mark to know him by. His Word or Promise is
as sacred to him in all his Affairs in the World,
as the strongest Obligation which can be laid on
him; nor is it a Thing form'd by him from set∣tled
Resolutions, or Measures of Policy taken
up of course to raise or fix his Reputation; but
'tis the native Produce of his honest Principle:
'Tis the Consequence, and his Honesty is the
Cause; he ceases to be Honest, when he ceases
to preserve this solemn Regard to his Word.</P>
<P>If he gives his Word, any Man may depend
upon it, for the Safety of his Life or Estate; he
scorns to prevaricate or shift himself off from the
punctual Observance of it, tho it be to his Loss.</P>
<P>I can't abate an honest Man an Inch in the pun∣ctual
Observance of a Promise made upon Parole,
if it be in the Man's possible Power to perform
it, because there seems to be something too base
to consist with Honesty in the very Nature of a
Man that can go back from his Word.</P>
<P>The Reverence our Ancestors paid to their
Promises, or Word past, I am of the Opinion,
<PB N="58" REF="74"/>
gave that remarkable Brand of Infamy and Scan∣dal
upon the Affront of giving the Lie; <HI>a Gentle∣man,</HI>
which is, in short, the modern Term for <HI>an
honest Man,</HI> or, a Man of Honour, cannot receive
a greater Reproach, than to be told, <HI>he lies;</HI> that
is, that he forfeits his Word, breaks his Veraci∣ty;
for the Minute he does that, he ungentlemans
himself, disgraces the Blood of his Family, de∣generates
from his Ancestors, and commences
Rake, Scoundrel, and any Thing.</P>
<P>Some People, who have run their Points of Ho∣nour
to the Extreams, are of the Opinion, that
this Affront of the Lie ought not to be given to
any Thing they, call a Gentleman, or that calls
himself so, till he has so far exposed himself to
all other Degrees of Infamy, as to bear Kicking,
or Caning, and the like; that after this, when he
breaks his Word, he may be told, <HI>he lies,</HI> or any
Thing else; but till then, the very Thing it self
is so intolerable an Abuse, that the Person who
ventures to trespass so foully on the Rules of good
Manners, deserves not the Honour of fair Play
for his Life: But as some Beasts of Prey are refu∣sed
the fair Law of the Field, and are knock'd
down in every Hedge; so these, like Bullies and
meer Rakes, may be pistol'd in the Dark, and
stabb'd at the Corner of an Alley; that is to say,
any leasure may be used with them, to dismiss
them from the Society of Mankind, as Fellows
not sufferable in the Common-wealth of good
Manner's.</P>
<P>I do not argue for these Extremes; but I in∣stance
in this, to testify the Veneration all good
Men have for the Word or Promise of an honest
Men, and the Esteem which the Integrity of the Mind
express'd by a zealous Regard to the Words of
the Mouth, have obtain'd in the World. The
<PB N="59" REF="75"/>
<HI>French,</HI> when they express themselves in Vindica∣tion
of their Honour, always bring it about by
this, <HI>Je suis homme de Parole,</HI> I am an honest
Man, or a Man of my Word; that is, I am a
Man that may be trusted upon my Parole; for I
never break my Word.</P>
<P>Such was the Value put upon the Promises of
Men in former Time, that a Promise of Payment
of Money was recoverable in put Courts by Law,
till the Inconveniencies prov'd so many, that an
Act was made on Purpose to restrain it to a Sum
under ten Pounds: But to this Day, if a Man
promises Marriage to a Woman, especially if she
has granted him any Favours upon that Condition,
the Laws of the Land, which therein have Re∣gard
to the Laws of Honour, will oblige him to
make it good, and allow it to be a sufficient Plea
to forbid his marrying with any body else.</P>
<P>There are innumerable Instances of the Vene∣ration
all Nations pay to the expressive Article of
human Veracity. In the War, you meet with
frequent Instances of Prisoners dismiss'd by a ge∣nerous
Enemy, upon their Parole, either to pay
their Ransom, or to procure such or such Condi∣tions
or come back and surrender themselves Pri∣soners;
and he that should forfeit this Parole,
wou'd be posted in the Enemy's Army, and hiss'd
out of his own.</P>
<P>I know nothing a wise Man would not chuse
to do, rather than by breaking his Word, give
the World such an undeniable Testimony of his
being a Knave; This is that good Name which
<HI>Solomon</HI> says <HI>is better than Life, and is a precious
Ointment, and which, when a Man has once lost, he
has nothing left worth keeping.</HI> A Man may even
hang himself out of the Way; for no Man that
looks like a Man, will keep his Company.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="76"/>
When a Man has once come to breaking his
Words no Mau, that has any Value for his Re∣putation,
cares to be seen in his Company; but all
good Men shun him, as if he were infected with
the Plague.</P>
<P>There are Men indeed, who will be exceeding
punctual to their Words and Promises, who yet
cannot be call'd honest Men, because they have
other Vices and Excursions that render them other
Ways wicked: These give their Testimony to
the Beauty of Honesty, by chusing it as the best
Mask to put a Gloss upon their Actions, and con∣ceal
the other Deformities of their Lives; and so
Honesty, like Religion, is made Use of to dis∣guise
the Hypocrite, and raise a Reputation upon
the Shadow, by the Advantage it takes of the
real Esteem the World has of the Substance: I say
of this Counterfeit-Honesty, as is said of Religi∣on
in like Cases. If Honesty was not the most ex∣cellent
Attainment, 'twould not be made Use or
as the most specious Pretence; nor is there a more
exquisite Way for a Man to play the Hypocrite,
than to pretend an extraordinary Zeal to the
Performance of his Promises; because, when the
Opinion of any Man's Honesty that Way, has
spread in the Thoughts of Men, there is nothing
so great, but they will trust him with, nor so
hard, but they will do it for him.</P>
<P>All Men reverence an honest Man; the Knaves
stand in Awe of him, Fools adore him, and wise
Men love him; and thus is Virtue its own
ward.</P>
<P>Honest Men are in more Danger from this one
Hypocrite, than from 20 open Knaves; for these
have a Mark plac'd upon them by their general
Character, as a Buoy upon a Rock to warn Stran∣gers
from venturing upon it: But the Hypocrites are
<PB N="61" REF="77"/>
like a Pit cover'd over, like Shoals under Water,
and Danger concealed which cannon be seen. I
must confess, I have found these the most dan∣gerous,
and have too deeply suffer'd by throwing
myself on their Protestations of Honesty: The
Esteem I always entertain'd of the most beautiful
Gift God has bestow'd, or Man could receive, has
made me the easier to be deceiv'd with the Re∣semblance
of it.</P>
<P>So much as I, or any one else, by the Vitious∣ness
of our own Nature, or the prevailing Force of
Accidents, Snares, and Temptations, have devia∣ted
from this shining Principle, to far we have been
foolish, as well as wicked; so much we have to
repent of towards our Maker, and be asham'd of
towards our Neighbour.</P>
<P>For my Part, I am never backward to own,
let who will be the Reader of these Sheets, that
to the Dishonour of my Maker, and the just Scan∣dal
of my own Honesty, I have not paid that due
Regard to the Rectitude of this Principle, which
my own Knowledge has own'd to be its due; let
those who have been juster to themselves, and
to the Giver of it, rejoice in the Happiness, ra∣ther
than triumph over the Infirmity.</P>
<P>But let them be sure, they have been juster on
their own Parts; let them be positive, that their
own Integrity is untainted, and would abide all
the Tryals and Racks, that a ruin'd Fortune,
strong Temptations, and deep Distresses, could
bring it into: Let them not boast till these Dan∣gers
are past, and they put their Armour off; and
if they can do it then, I will freely acknowledge,
they have less need of Repentance than I.</P>
<P>Not that I pretend, as I noted before, and
shall often repeat, that these Circumstances ren∣der
my Failing, or any Man's else, the less a Sin,
<PB N="62" REF="78"/>
but they make the Reason, Why we that have
fallen, should rather be pity'd than reproach'd by
those who think they stand, because, when the
same Assaults are made upon the Chastity of
their Honour, it may be every jot as likely to be
prostituted as their Neighbours.</P>
<P>And such is the Folly of Scandal, as well as
the Blindness of Malice, that it seldom fixes Re∣proach
upon the right Foot: I have seen so much
of it, with respect to other People, as well
as my self, that it gives me a very scoundrel Opi∣nion
of all those People whom I find forward to
load their Neighbours with Reproach. Nothing
is more frequent in this Case, than to run away
with a Piece of a Man's Character, in which
they err, and do him Wrong; and leave that Part
of him untouch'd which is really black, and
would bear it; this makes me sometimes,
when with the humblest and most abasing
Thoughts of my self, I look up, and betwixt
God and my own Soul, cry out, <HI>What a Wretch
am I!</HI> at the same time smile at the hair-brain'd
Enemy, whose Tongue tipt with Malice, runs a∣head
of his Understanding, and missing the Crimes
for which I deserve more than he can inflict, re∣proaches
me with those I never committed. Me∣thinks
I am ready to call him back, like the
Huntsman, when the Dogs run upon the Foil, and
say, hold, hold, your are wrong; <HI>take hint here,
and you have him.</HI></P>
<P>I question not but 'tis the same with other Peo∣ple;
for when Malice is in the Heart, Reproach
generally goes a Mile before Consideration, and
where is the Honesty of the Man all this while?
This is trampling upon my Pride, <HI>sed majo∣ri
fastu;</HI> but with greater Pride; 'tis exposing my
Dishonesty, but with the highest Knavery; 'tis
<PB N="63" REF="79"/>
a Method no honest Man will take, and when
taken, no honest Man regards; wherefore, let
none of these Sons of Slander take Satisfaction in the
frequent Acknowledgments I am always ready to
make of my own failing, for that Humility with
which I always find Cause to look into my own
Heart; where I see others worse, and more guilty of
Crimes than they can lay to my Charge, yet makes
me look back upon their Weakness with the last
Contempt, who fix their impotent Charges where
there is not Room to take hold, and run away
with the Air, and Shadow of Crimes never com∣mitted.</P>
<P>I have instanc'd this, not at all on my own
Account, for 'tis not worth while; for if I am
injur'd, what's that to troubling the World with,
when I am forgotten; but while I am examin∣ing
the nicest Article in the World, <HI>Honesty,</HI> I can∣not
but lay down these three Heads from the pre∣ceding
Observations.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. He who is forward to reproach the Infirmities
of other Mens Honesty, is very near a Breach of
his own.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. He that hastily reproaches another without suffi∣cient
Ground, cannot be an honest Man.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Where there may be sufficient Ground of Reproach,
yet an honest Man is always tender of his Neigh∣bour's
Character from the Sense of his own
Frailty.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>But I return to Honesty, as it affects a Man's
pledging his Word, which is the Counter-part of
his Principle, and this because as I said, I should
chiefly regard this Honesty, as it concerns human
Affairs Conversation, and Negotiation.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="80"/>
And here I meet with a Tradesman come
just in from dunning one of his Neighbours:
Well, I have been at a Place for Money, <HI>says he,</HI> but
I can get none; there's such a one, he passes for an
honest Man, but I am sure he is a great Rogue to
me, for he has promised me my Money a long
Time, but puts me off still From Time to Time;
he makes no more of breaking his Word, than
of drinking a Glass of Beer. I am sure he has
told me forty Lies already; this is one of your
honest Men, if all such honest Men were hang'd we
should have a better Trade; and thus he runs on.</P>
<P>If all such honest Men were hang'd, they that
were left might have a better Trade, but how
many of them would there be?</P>
<P>Now tho' I shall no Way vindicate Mens hasty
Promises absolutely to perform what is doubtful
in the Event, yet I cannot agree, that every Man
who having promis'd a Payment, does not per∣form
it, to his Time, is a Knave or a Lyar; if it
were so, the Lord have Mercy upon three Parts
of the City.</P>
<P>Wherefore, to state this Matter clearly, it must
be taken a little to Pieces, and the Articles spo∣ken
to apart.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Without Question, when a Man makes a
Promise of Payment to another on a set Day, know∣ing
in his own Thoughts that it is not probable he
should be capable to comply with it, or really
designing not to comply with it, or not endea∣vouring
to comply with it: 'Tis a Deceit put
upon the Parry, 'tis a premeditated formal Lye,
the Man that made it is a Stranger to Honesty,
he is a Knave, and every Thing that is base and
bad. But</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Promises ought to be understood both
by the Person to whom, and the Person by whom,
<PB N="65" REF="81"/>
they are made as liable to those Contingencies
that all human Affairs and Persons are liable to,
as Death, Accidents, Disappointments, and Dis∣order:
Thus, if a Man, who ought to pay me
to Day, tells me, Sir, I cannot comply with you
to Day, but if you call for it next Week, you shall
have it.</P>
<P>If I may put this Answer into plainer <HI>English;</HI> and
I suppose the Man to be an honest Man; I cannot
understand his Meaning otherwise than thus:</P>
<P>“Sir, I acknowledge your Money is due;
I have not Cash enough by me to pay you to
Day; but I have several running Bills, and se∣veral
Persons who have promised me Money,
which I doubt not I shall receive against such a
Time; and if you call then, I make no Que∣stion,
but I shall be able to do it; and if it is
possible for me to pay you, I will do it at that
Time, without Fail.”</P>
<P>I confess, it were as well to express themselves
thus at large, in all the Appointments People make
for Payment; and would the Persons who make
them consider it, they would do so: But Custom
has prevail'd in our general Way of Speaking,
whereby all Things that are subject to the com∣mon
known Contingents of Life, or visible in the
Circumstances of the Case, are understood without
being expressed. For Example:</P>
<P>I make an Appointment of meeting a Man po∣sitively
at such a Town, such a certain Day or
Hour; if I were talking to a <HI>Turk</HI> or a <HI>Pagan</HI> that
knows nothing, or believes nothing, of Supreme
Providence; I would say, <HI>If the Lord of Heaven
and Earth that governs all my Actions, please to pre∣serve
and permit me:</HI> But when I am talking to as
<HI>Christian,</HI> it should seem to be so universally sup∣posed,
that every Appointment is subjected, and
<PB N="66" REF="82"/>
submits to the Government of Providence, that the
Repetition would be needless; and that when a
Man promises positively to meet, 'tis with a general
<HI>Subintelligitur,</HI> a Reserve as natural as Nature it
self, to the Divine Permission: All Men know, that
unless I am alive, I cannot come there; or, if I
am taken sick, both which may easily happen,
I shall disappoint him: And therefore, if he shou'd
urge me again to come without Fail, and I should
rep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, I won't fail, if I am alive and well, the
Man ought to take it for an Affront, and ask me,
if I take him for a Fool, to think, if I am taken
sick, I should come with my Bed at my Back; or
if Death should interveen, he had Occasion to
speak with my Ghost.</P>
<P>In this Sense, a Tradesman who promises Pay∣ment
of Money at a set Time; first 'tis suppo∣sed
he has it not now in his Hands, because he
puts off the Person demanding to a further Day,
and promises to comply with it then: This Pro∣mise
therefore, can be understood no otherwise,
than that he expects to receive Money by that
Time: Now, if this Man, by the like Disap∣pointments
from other Men, or any other invo∣luntary
Casualty, is really and <HI>bona fide</HI> unable
to comply with the Time of promised Payment;
I cannot see, but this may befal an honest Man,
and he neither designing to fail when he promi∣sed,
nor being able to prevent the Accident that
oblig'd him to do it, nor any way voluntary in the
Breach, is not in my Opinion guilty of a Lie, or
Breach of his Honour, tho' he did not make
those verbal Reserves in the Promises he had
given.</P>
<P>If every Man, who cannot comply with pro∣mised
Payments, should be thus branded with
Lying and Dishonesty, then let him, who is
<PB N="67" REF="83"/>
without the Sin, cast the Stone, for no body
else ought to do it.</P>
<P>'Tis true, there is a Difference between an
Accident, and a Practice; that is in short, there
is a Difference between him who meets with a
great many Occasions thus to break his Word,
and he that meets with but a few: But if it be
a Crime, he that commits it once, is no more an
honest Man, than he that commits it forty Times;
and if it be not a Crime, he that does it forty
Times, is as honest as he that has Occasion to do
it but once.</P>
<P>But let no Man take Encouragement from hence,
to be prodigal of his Word, and slack in his Per∣formance;
for this nice Path is so near the Edge
of the Pit of Knavery, that the least Slip lets you
fall in.</P>
<P>These Promises must have Abundance of Cir∣cumstances
to bring the honest Man out of the
Scandal.</P>
<P>As, 1st. The Disappointments which occasioned
this Breach of his Word, must have been un∣foreseen,
and unexpected, otherwise the Ex∣pectation
of performing his Promise, was ill
grounded, and then his Honesty is answe∣rable
for the very making the Promise, as
well as the breaking it.</P>
<P>2d. No Endeavours must be wanting to com∣ply
with the Promise; otherwise 'tis wrong
to say, I am disappointed, and can't make
good my Word; the Man ought to say, Sir,
I have disappointed my self by my Negli∣gence
or Wilfulness, and have obliged my
self to break my Word; or, in <HI>English,</HI> Sir, I
am a Knave; for tho' I made you a Promise
which I might have performed, I took no
<PB N="68" REF="84"/>
Care about it, not valuing the Forfeiture of
my Word.</P>
<P>If then the Case is so nice, tho' in the Strict∣ness
of Speaking, such a Disappointment may
oblige an honest Man to break his Word; yet
every honest Man, who would preserve that Cha∣racter
to himself, ought to be the more wary, and
industriously avoid: making such absolute uncon∣ditional
Promises, because we are to avoid the
Circumstances of Offence.</P>
<P>But as to the Nature of the Thing, 'tis plain to
me, that a Man may in such Cases be obliged to
break his Word unwillingly, and nothing can be
a Fraud or dishonest Action in that Case, which is
not either voluntary in it self, or the Occasion
voluntarily procur'd.</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>Of Relative HONESTY.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S Honesty is simple and plain, with∣out
Gloss and Pretence, so 'tis univer∣sal:
He that may uphold an untainted
Reputation in one Particular, may be
justly branded with Infamy in another. A Man
may be punctual in his Dealings, and a Knave
in his Relations; honest in his Ware-house, and
a Knave at his Fire-side: He may be a Saint in
his Company, a Devil in his Family; true to his
Word, and false to his Friendship: But whosoe∣ver
he be, he is no honest Man. An honest
Man is all of a Piece, the whole Contexture of
his Life, his general Conduct is genuine, and
squar'd according to the Rules of Honesty; he
never runs into Extremes and Excesses on one
Hand or other.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="85"/>
I confess, I find 'this Thing, which they call
<HI>Relative Honesty,</HI> very little, thought of in the
World; and that which is still worse, 'tis very lit∣tle
understood: I'll bring it down to but a few
Examples; some of which frequently happen a∣mong
us, and will therefore be the more familiar∣ly
receiv'd.</P>
<P>There are relative Obligations entail'd on us
in our Family Circumstances, which are just
Debts, and must be paid; and which, in a Word,
a Man can no more be honest, if he does not make
Conscience of Discharging, than he can in the
Case of the most unquestionable Debts between
Man and Man.</P>
<P>The Debts from Children to Parents, and from
Wives to their Husbands, are in a Manner re∣latively
chang'd, and the Obligation transferr'd
into the Order of religious Duties. God the
Guide and Commander of all Subordination, has
as it were, taken that Part into his own Hand;
'tis rather call'd a Duty to him, than a relative
Duty only: But if Men take this for a Discharge
to them, of all relative Obligations to Wives and
to Children, or that God had less required one
than the other, they must act upon very wrong
Principles.</P>
<P>Nature indeed dictates in general a Man's
providing Subsistence for his Family, and he is
declared to be so far from a Christian, that he is
worse than an Infidel that neglects it: But there
are other Parts of our Obligations, which Ho∣nesty
calls upon us to perform.</P>
<P>A Wife and Children are Creditors to the Fa∣ther
or the Family; and he cannot be an honest
Man that does not discharge his Debt to them,
any more than he could, if he did not repay Mo∣ney
borrowed, to a Stranger and not to lead my
<PB N="70" REF="86"/>
Reader on to intricate and disputed Particulars;
I instance principally in those that no body can
dispute: As <HI>First,</HI> EDUCATION: By this
I mean, not only putting Children to School,
which some Parents think, is all they have to do
with or for their Children; and indeed with some,
is all that they know how to do, or are fit to do:
I say, I do not mean this only, but several other
additional Cares, as (1.) Directing what School,
what Parts of Learning, is proper for them, what
Improvements they are to be taught. (2.) Study∣ing
the Genius and Capacities of their Children,
in what they teach them: Some Children will vo∣luntarily
learn one Thing, and can never be forc'd
to learn another's and for Want of which observing
the Genius of Children, we have so many learned
Blockheads in the World, who are mere Scholars,
Pedants, and no more. (3.) But the main Part of
this Debt, which Relative Honesty calls upon us
to pay to our Children, is the Debt of Instruction,
the Debt of Government, the Debt of Example:
He that neglects to pay any of these to his Fami∣ly,
is a <HI>relative Knave;</HI> let him value himself
upon his Honesty, in paying his other Debts,
as much as he will.</P>
<P>'Tis a strange Notion Men have of Honesty,
and of their being honest Men, as if it related to no∣thing
but Tradesmen, or Men who borrow and
lend; or that the Title was obtain'd by an ordi∣nary
Observance of Right and Wrong between
Man and Man. 'Tis a great Mistake, the Name
of an honest Man is neither so easily gain'd, or so
soon lost, as these Men imagine. <HI>David</HI> was a
very honest Man, notwithstanding his Passion and
Revenge in the Case of <HI>Nabal,</HI> his Murther in the
Case of <HI>U<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iah,</HI> or his Ad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery in the Case of <HI>Bath∣sheba.</HI>
The Intent and main Design of his Life
<PB N="71" REF="87"/>
was upright; and whenever he fell by the Power
of that Temptation that overcame him, he rose
again by Repentance.</P>
<P>Let no vain Men flatter themselves with the
Pride of their Honesty, in mere Matters of Debtor
and Creditor, tho' that's also absolutely necessary
and essential to an honest Man.</P>
<P>But trace this honest Man home to his Family:
Is he a Tyrant or a Churl to his Wife? Is he a
Stranger to the Conduct and Behaviour of his
Children? Is he an <HI>Eli</HI> to their Vices? Are they
I uninstructed, uncorrected, unexhorted ungover∣ned,
or ill governed? That Man's <HI>a Knave,</HI> a re∣lative
Knave; he neither does his Duty to God,
or pays the Debt of a Husband, or of a Parent to
His Wife or his Family.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> After the Debt of EDUCATION,
there is the Debt of INDUCTION due
from us to our Children. The Debt from a Pa∣rent
is far from ending when the Children come
from School, as the Brutes who turn their Young
off from them when they are just able to pick for
themselves: It is our Business, doubtless, to introduce
them into the World, and to do it in such a manner,
as suits the Circumstances we are in, as to their
Supply, and the Inclinations and Capacities of
our Children: This is a Debt, the Want of pay∣ing
which, makes many Children too justly re∣proach
their Parents with neglecting them in their
Youth, and not giving them the necessary Intro∣duction
into the World, as might have qualify'd
them to struggle and shift for themselves.</P>
<P>Not to do this, is to ruine our Children nega∣tively
on one Hand, as doing it without Judgment,
and without Regard to our Family Circumstan∣ces,
and our Childrens Capacities, is a positive
ruining them on the other. I could very usefully
<PB N="72" REF="88"/>
run out this Part into a long Discourse on the Ne∣cessity
there is of consulting the Inclinations and
Capacities of our Children, in our placing them
out in the World. How many a martial Spirit do
we find damn'd to Trade, while we spoil many a
good Porter, and convert the able Limbs and
Bones of a Blockhead into the Figure of a long
Robe, or a Gown and Cassock?</P>
<P>How many awkward clumsy Fellows do we
breed to Surgery, or to Musick, whose Fingers
and Joints, Nature originally design'd, and plain∣ly
shew'd it us by their Size, were better suited
for the Blacksmith's Sledge, or the Carpenter's
Axe, the Waterman's Oar, or the Carman's
Whip?</P>
<P>Whence comes it to pass, that we have so many
young Men brought to the Bar, and to the Pul∣pit,
with stammering Tongues; Hesitations, and
Impediments in their Speech, unmusical Voices,
and no common Utterance; while on the other
Hand, Nature's Cripples, Bow-legg'd, Battle∣ham'd,
and half-made Creatures, are bred Tum∣blers
and Dancing-Masters.</P>
<P>I name these, because they occur most in our
common Observation, and are all miserable Ex∣amples,
where the Children curse the Knavery of
their Fathers, in not paying the Debt they ow'd
to them as Parents, in putting them to Employ∣ments
that had been suitable to their Capacities,
and suitable to what Nature had cut them out for.</P>
<P>I came into a publick House once in <HI>London,</HI>
where there was a black <HI>Maletta</HI>-look'd Man sit∣ting,
talking very warmly among some Gentle∣men,
who I observ'd were listening very attentive∣ly
to what he said; and I sat myself down, and
did the like; 'twas with great Pleasure I heard him
discourse very handsomly on several weighty Sub∣jects;
<PB N="73" REF="89"/>
I found he was a very good Scholar,
had been very handsomely bred, and that Lear∣ning
and Study was his Delight; and more than
that, some of the best of Science was at that Time
his Employment: At length I took the Freedom
to ask him, If he was born in <HI>England?</HI></P>
<P>He reply'd with a great deal of good Humour
in the Manner, but with an Excess of Resentment
at his Father, and with Tears in his Eyes, Yes,
yes, Sir, I am a true-born <HI>English</HI> Man, to my
Father's Shame be it spoken; who being an <HI>English</HI>
Man himself, could find in his Heart to join him∣self
to a <HI>Negro</HI> Woman, tho' he must needs know,
the Children he should beget, would curse the Me∣mory
of such an Action, and abhor his very Name
for the sake of it. Yes, yes, says he, repeating
it again, I am an <HI>English</HI> Man, and born in law∣ful
Wedlock; happy had it been for me, tho' my
Father had gone to the Devil for Whoredom,
had he lain with a Cook-Maid, or produced
me from the meanest Beggar Woman in the Street.
My Father might do the Duty of Nature to his
black Wise; but, God knows, he did no Justice
to his Children. If it had not been for this
damn'd black Face of mine, says he then smiling,
I had been bred to the Law, or brought up in the
Study of Divinity: But my Father gave me Lear∣ning
to no manner of Purpose; for he knew I should
never be able to rise by it to any Thing, but a
learned <HI>Valet de Chamber.</HI> What he put me to
School for, I cannot imagine: He spoil'd a good
Tarpawlin, when he strove to make me a Gentle∣man:
When he had resolv'd to marry a Slave, and
lye with a Slave, he should have begot Slaves,
and let us have been bred as we were born: But he
has twice ruin'd me; first with getting me a fright∣ful
<PB N="74" REF="90"/>
Face, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen going to paint a Gentleman
upon me.</P>
<P>It was a most affecting Discourse indeed, and as
such I record it; and I found it ended in Tears,
from the Person who was in himself the most de∣serving,
modest, and judicious Man, that I ever
met with, under a <HI>Negro</HI> Countenance in my Life.</P>
<P>After this Story, I perswaded myself I need say
no more to this Case; the Education of our Chil∣dren,
their Instruction, and the Introducing them
into the World, is a Part of Honesty, a Debt we
owe to them; and he cannot be an honest Man
that does not to the utmost of his Ability and
Judgment, endeavour to pay it.</P>
<P>All the other relative Obligations, which Fa∣mily
Circumstances call for the Discharge of, al∣low
the same Method of arguing for, and are
Debts in their Proportion, and must be paid upon
the same Principle of Integrity. I have neither
room, nor is there any Occasion to enlarge upon
them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">OF THE
Immorality of, CONVERSATION,
AND
The Vulgar ERRORS of Behaviour.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">C</SEG>Onversation is the brightest and
most beautiful Part of Life; 'tis an
Emblem of the Enjoyment of a fu∣ture
State; <HI>for suitable Society is a
heavenly Life;</HI> 'tis that Part of Life
by which Mankind are not only
distinguish'd from the inanimate World, but by
which they, are distinguish'd from one another.
Perhaps I may be more particularly sensible of the
Benefit and of the Pleasure of it, having been so
effectually mortify'd with the Want of it: But as
I take it to be one of the Peculiars of the ratio∣nal
Life, that Man is a conversible Creature; so
'tis his most compleat Blessing in Life, to be bles∣sed
with suitable Persons about him to converse
with. Bringing it down from Generals to Par∣ticulars,
nothing can recommend a Man more, no∣thing
renders him more agreeable, nothing can be
a better Character to give of one Man to another,
next to that of his being an honest and religious
Man, than to say of him that he is very good Com∣pany.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="92"/>
How delightful is in to see a Man's Face al∣ways
cover'd with Smiles, and his Soul shining
continually in the Goodness of his Temper; to see
an Air of Humour and Pleasantness sit ever upon
his Brow, and to find him on all Occasions the
same, ever agreeable to others, and to himself; a
steady Calm of Mind, a clear Head, and serene
Thoughts always acting the Mastership upon him:
Such a Man has something angelick in his very
Countenance; the Life of such a Man is one en∣tire
Scene of Composure; 'tis an Anticipation of
the future State, which we well represent by an
eternal Peace.</P>
<P>To such a Man to be angry, is only to be just
to himself, and to act as he ought to do; to be
troubled or sad, is only to act his Reason; for as
to being in a Passion, he knows nothing of it; Pas∣sion
is a Storm in the Mind, and this never hap∣pens
to him; for all Exccesses, either of Grief or
of Resentment, are Foreigners, and have no Ha∣bitation
with him: He is the only Man that can
observe that Scripture heavenly Dictate, <HI>Be an∣gry
and sin not;</HI> and if ever he is very angry, 'tis
with himself, for giving Way to be angry with any
one else.</P>
<P>This is the truly agreeable Person, and the on∣ly
one that can be call'd so in the World; his Com∣pany
is a Charm, and is rather wonder'd at than
imitated: 'Tis almost a Vertue to envy such a
Man; and one is apt innocently to grieve at him,
when we see what is so desirable in him, and can∣not
either find it, or make it in our selves.</P>
<P>But take this with you in the Character of this
happy Man, namely, that he is always a good
Man, a religious Man: 'Tis a gross Error to ima∣gine,
that a Soul blacken'd with Vice, loaded with
Crime, degenerated into Immorality and Folly,
<PB N="77" REF="93"/>
can be that Man, can have this calm, serene Soul,
those clear Thoughts, those constant Smiles upon
his Brow, and the steady Agreeableness and Plea∣santry
in his Temper, that I am speaking of; there
must be Intervals of Darkness upon such a Mind;
Storms in the Conscience will always lodge Clouds
upon the Countenance; and where the Weather
is hazey within, it can never be Sun-shine without;
the Smiles of a disturb'd Mind are all but feign'd
and forg'd; there may be a good Disposition, but
it will be too often and too evidently interrupted
by the Recoils of the Mind, to leave the Tem∣per
untouch'd, and the Humour free and uncon∣cern'd;
when the Drum beats an Alarm within
it is impossible but the Disturbance will be dis∣cover'd
without.</P>
<P>Mark the Man of Crime; sit close to him in
Company, at the End of the most exube∣rant
Excursion of his Mirth, you will never
fail, to hear his reflecting Faculty whisper a
Sigh to him; he'll shake it off, you will see him
check it and go on; perhaps he sings it off, but
at the End of every Song, nay perhaps of every
Stanza, it returns; a kind of involuntary Sadness
breaks upon all his Joy; he perceives it, rouzes,
despises it, and goes on; but in the Middle of a
long Laugh, in drops a Sigh; it will be, it can
be no otherwise; and I never convers'd closely
with a Man of Levity in my Life, but I could
perceive it most plainly; 'tis a Kind of Respira∣tion,
natural to a stisl'd Conviction; a Hesitation
that is the Consquence of a captivated Vertue:
a little Insurrection in the Soul against the Tyran∣ny
of profligate Principles.</P>
<P>But in the good Man the Calm is compleat;
'tis all Nature, no Counter<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eit; he is always in
Humour, because he is always compos'd.</P>
<Q><PB N="78" REF="94"/>
He's calm without, because he's clear within.</Q>
<P>A stated Composure of Mind can really pro∣ceed
from nothing but a Fund of Vertue; and
this is the Reason why 'tis my Opinion, that the
common Saying, That Content of Mind is Hap∣piness,
is a vulgar Mistake, unless it be granted,
that this Content is first founded on such a Basis,
as the Mind ought to be contented with; for
otherwise a Lunatick in <HI>Bedlam</HI> is a compleatly
happy Man, he sings in his Hutch, and dan∣ces
in his Chain, and is as contented as any Man
living: The Possession or Power, which that Va∣pour
or Delirium has upon his Brain, makes him
fancy himself a Prince, a Monarch, a Statesman,
or just what he pleases to be; as a certain Dut∣chess,
is said to have believ'd her self to be and
press, has her Footmen drawn up, with Javelins,
and dress'd in antick Habits, that she may see
them thro' a Window, and believe them to be
her Guards; is serv'd upon the Knee; call'd her
Majesty, Imperial Majesty, and the like and
with this Splendor, her distemper'd Mind is
deluded, forming Ideas of Things which are
not, and at the same Time her Eyes are shut to
the eternal Captivity of her Circumstances; in
which she is made a Property to other Persons, her
Estate manag'd by Guardianship, and she a poor
demented Creature to the last Degree, an Ob∣ject
of human Compassion, and compleatly mi∣serable.</P>
<P>The only Contentment which entitles Mankind
to any Felicity, is that which is founded upon
Vertue and just Principles; for Contentment is
nothing more or less than what we call Peace;
and what Peace, where Crime possesses the Mind,
<PB N="79" REF="95"/>
which is attended, as a natural Consequence, with
Torment and Disquiet? What Peace where the
Harmony of the Soul is broken by constant Re∣gret,
and Self-Reproaches? What Peace in a Mind
under constant Apprehensions and Terrors of
something yet attending to render them misera∣ble;
and all this is inseparable from a Life of Crime.</P>
<Q>For where there's Guilt, there always will Fear.</Q>
<P>Peace of Mind makes a Halcyon upon the Coun∣tenance,
it guilds the Face with a chearful Aspect,
such as nothing else can procure; and which indeed
as above, it is impossible effectually to counter∣feit.</P>

But I return to the Subject of Conversation, from
which this Digression is made only to shew that
the Fund of agreeable Conversation is, and can
only be founded in Virtue; this alone is the Thing
that keeps a Man always in Humour, and always
agreeable.</P>
<P>They mistake much, who think Religion; or a
strict Morality, discomposes the Temper, sowres
the Mind, and unfits a Man for Conversation.
'Tis irrational to think, a Man can't be bright,
unless he is wicked; It may as well be said, a
Man cannot be merry till he is mad; not agree∣able
till he is offensive, not in Humour till he is out
of himself. 'Tis clear to me, no Man can be truly
merry, but he that is truly virtuous: Wit is as
consistent with Religion, as Religion is with good
Manners; nor is there any Thing, in the Limita∣tions
of Virtue and Religion; I mean, the just
Restraints which Religion and Virtue lay upon us
in Conversation; that should abate the Pleasure of
it, on the contrary they encrease it; <HI>For Example:</HI>
Restraints from vicious and indecent Discourses<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
There's as little Manners in those Things, as
there is Mirth in them; nor indeed does Re∣ligion
or Virtue rob Conversation of one Grain
of true Mirth: On the contrary, the religious
Man is the only Man fully qualify'd for Mirth
and good Humour; with this Advantage, that
when the vitious and the virtuous Man appear gay
and merry, but differ, <HI>as they must do,</HI> in the Subject
of their Mirth, you may always observe the virtu∣ous
Man's Mirth is superiour to the other; more
suitable to him, as a Man, as a Gentleman, as a
wise Man, and as a good Man; and generally
speaking, the other will acknowledge it; at least,
afterward, when his Thoughts cool, and as his
Reflections come in.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="98"/>
But what shall we do to correct the Vices of
Conversation? How shall we shew Men the Pi∣cture
of their own Behaviour? There is not a
greater Undertaking in the World, or an Attempt
of more Consequence to the Good of Mankind
than this; but 'tis as difficult also, as it is use∣ful;
and at best I shall make but a little Progress
in it in this Work; <HI>let others mend it.</HI></P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Of unfitting our selves for CONVER∣SATION.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>Efore I enter upon the Thing which I
call the Immorality of Conversation,
let me say a little about the many weak
and foolish Ways, by which Men strive,
as it were, to unfit themselves for Conversation.
Human Infirmities furnish us with several Things
that help to make us unconversible; we need not
study to encrease the Disadvantages we lye under
on that Score: Vice and Intemperance, <HI>not as a
Crime only, that I should speak of by itself,</HI> but even
as a Distemper, unfit us for Conversation; they
help to make us cynical, morose, surly, and rude.
Vicious People boast of their polite Carriage and
their nice Behaviour, how gay, how good hu∣mour'd,
how agreeable? for a While it may be so:
But trace them as Men of Vice, follow them till
they come to Years, and observe, while you live,
you never see the Humour last, but they grow fie∣ry,
morose, positive, and petulant. An ancient
Drunkard is a Thing indeed not often seen; be∣cause
the Vice has one good Faculty with it, <HI>viz.</HI>
That in seldom hands them, on to <HI>old Age;</HI> But
an ancient <HI>and good humour'd Drunkard,</HI> I think I
never knew.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="99"/>
It seems strange, that Men should affect unfit∣ting
themselves for Society, and study to make
themselves unconversible, whereas their being
truly Sociable, as Men, is the Thing which
would most recommend them, and that to the
best of Men, and best answers to the highest Fe∣licity
of Life. Let no Man value himself upon
being morose and cynical, sour and unconversible,
'tis the Reverse of a good Man; a truly religi∣ous
Man follows the Rule of the Apostle, <HI>be Af∣fable,
be Courteous, be Humble; in Meekness, esteeming
every Man better than our selves;</HI> whereas Conversa∣tion
now is the Reverse of the Christian Rule;
'tis interrupted with Conceitedness and Affectati∣on,
<HI>a Pride, esteeming our selves better than every
Man;</HI> and that which is worse still, this happens
generally, when indeed the Justice of the Case is
against us; for where is the Man who thus over∣ruling
himself, is not evidently inferiour in Merit
to all about him? Nay, and frequently those
who put most Value upon themselves, have the
least Merit to support it. <HI>Self-Conceit</HI> is the
Bane of human Society, and generally speaking
is the Peculiar of those who have the least to
recommend them; 'tis the Ruin of Conversation,
and the Destruction of all Improvement; for how
should any Man receive any Advantage from the
Conversation of others, who believes himself qua∣lified
to teach them, and not to have Occasion to
learn any Thing from them?</P>
<P>Nay, as the Fool is generally the Man that is
conceited most of his own Wit, so that very
Conceit is the Ruin of him; it confirms him a
Fool all the Days of his Life, for he that thinks
himself a wise Man, is a Fool, and knows it
not; nay, 'tis impossible, he should continue to be
<PB N="84" REF="100"/>
a Fool, if he was but once convinc'd of his,
Folly.</P>
<Q><L>If Fools could their own Ignorance discern,</L>
<L>They'd be no longer Fools, <HI>because they'd learn.</HI></L></Q>
<P>It will be objected here indeed, that Folly and
Conceit may be hurtful to Conversation, may
rob Men of the Advantage of it, unfit one Side
for Conversing, and make it unprofitable, as well
as unpleasant to the other; But that this is no∣thing
to the Immorality of Conversation; that Ig∣norance
and Conceit may be an Infirmity, but is
not always a Crime; that the Mischief of
Mens being Fools as generally their own, but
the Mischief of their being Knaves is to other
People, and this is very true. But certainly, e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣gregious
Folly merits one Paragraph of Rebuke;
perhaps it may touch the Senses of some weak
Brethren one time or other, and the Labour may
not be lost.</P>
<P>I never saw a more simple, or yet a more fu∣rious
irreconcileable Quarrel, than once between
two of the most empty conceited People that e∣ver
I knew in the World; and it was upon one
calling the other <HI>Fool,</HI> which on both Sides was
unhappily very true; they fought upon the Spot,
but were parted by the Company; they chal∣lenged,
and could not meet, their Friends getting
Notice of it; in short, it ruin'd them both; they
made new Appointments, and at last deceiv'd their
Friends, and fought again; they were both woun∣ded,
and one died, the other fled the Country,
and never return'd. The first own'd he was a
Fool; which was indeed some Diminution of his
Folly. I say, he knew himself to be a Fool, but
could not bear the other should tell him so, who
<PB N="85" REF="101"/>
was more a Fool than himself. The other boldly as∣serted
his own Capacities to be infinitely greater
than they were, and despised the first to the last
Degree, who indeed, if he had not more Wit,
had more Modesty than the other; but both like
Fools fought about <HI>Nothing,</HI> for such indeed the
Question about their Wit might very well have
been call'd.</P>
<P>But, it is true, after all, the Want of a con∣versible
Temper, if from a Want or Defect of
Sense may be an Infirmity, not an Immorality;
that is to say, the Cause is not so in itself, but
it may be so in its Consequences, that way also.
<HI>For the Conversation of Fools is Vanity in the Ab∣stract.</HI>
I might here indeed find Subject for a
large Tract, upon the infinite Diversity of Fools,
and by consequence the wondrous Beauty of their
Conversation: I have on this Occasion reckon'd
up a List of about Seven and Thirty several Sorts
of Fools, besides <HI>Solomon</HI>'s <HI>Fool,</HI> whom I take to be
<HI>the wicked Fool</HI> only; these I have diversified by
their Tempers and Humours, and in the infinite
Variety of their Follies of several Sorts, in every
one of which they rob themselves, and all that
keep them Company of the Felicity of Conver∣sation,
there being nothing in them but Empti∣ness,
or a Fulness of what is Ridiculous, and on∣ly
qualified to be laught at, or found Fault
with.</P>
<P>I have likewise describ'd some of their Con∣versation,
their vain Repetitions, their Catch-Words,
their Laughings and Gestures, and adap∣ted
them to make the World merry. I have
Thoughts of running it on into foreign Chara∣cters,
and describe <HI>French, Spanish, Portuguese</HI>
Fools, and Fools of <HI>Russia, China,</HI> and the <HI>East
Indies:</HI> But as this is something remote from the
<PB N="86" REF="102"/>
Design in Hand, which is more serious, and
done on a much better View, and likewise of
an unmeasurable Length, like the weighty Sub∣ject
it is upon (<HI>for Folly is a large Field</HI>) so I re∣fer
it to another Opportunity.</P>
<P>The Truth is, that Part of Conversation which
I am now to speak of, or which I mean by what
I have said upon this Subject, is the weighty and
serious Part, and is not the meer common Talk,
or a Conversation which Fools are capable of;
'tis exercised in a solid and well temper'd Frame,
and when regulated as it ought to be, by Virtue,
and good Morals, is quallified to make Mankind
happy in the Enjoyment of the best Things,
and of the best Company, and therefore, the E∣vils
that creep into, and corrupt this Part of our
Conversation, are of the more fatal Quality, and
worth our exposing, that People may see and
shun them, and that Conversation may be restored
among us to what it should be.</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>1. Of the Immorality of CONVER∣SATION
in General.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>OME may object against the Term
<HI>the Immorality</HI> of Conversation, and
think the Word improper to the Sub∣ject;
but to save any Critick the dearly
beloved Labour of cavilling in Favour of ill Man∣ners
and unbecoming Behaviour, I shall explain
myself before I go any farther.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="103"/>
I call Conversation immoral, where the Dis∣course
is indecent, where 'tis irreligious or pro∣fane,
where 'tis immodest or scandalous, or where
'tis slanderous and abusive. In these and such Ca∣ses,
<HI>loqui est agere,</HI> thus talking lewdly, or talking
profanely, is an immodest Action. Such is the
Power of Words that Mankind is able to act, as
much Evil by their Tongues, as by their Hands;
the Ideas that are formed in the Mind from what
we hear, are most peircing and permanent; and
the Force of Example in this Case, is not more
powerful than the Force of Argument.</P>
<P>Some of the worst Sins are not to be commit∣ted
but by the Tongue, as the Sin of Blasphemy,
speaking Treason against the Majesty of God,
Cursings and Imprecations among Men, <HI>Lies,
Slanders,</HI> and a vast Variety of petty Excursions,
which are grown modish by Custom, and seem too
small to be reproved.</P>
<P>We are here in <HI>England,</HI> after many Years De∣generacy,
arrived to a Time, wherein Vice is in
general discountenanc'd by Authority; God in
Mercy to the Age has inspir'd our Government
with a Resolution to discourage it: The King
now, his Wars are over, and his foreign Enemies
allow him some Rest, will, we hope, declare War
against this Domestick Enemy.</P>
<P>The late Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> of heavenly Memory, for
her Piety and blessed Example, appear'd in her
Time gallantly in the Cause of Virtue: Magi∣strates
were encourag'd to punish Vice, new
Laws made to restrain it, and Justice seem'd to
be at Work to reclaim it: But what can Kings, or
Queens, or Parliaments do? Laws and Procla∣mations
are weak and useless Things, unless some
secret Influence can affect the Practices of those
whom no Laws can reach.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="104"/>
To make Laws against Words, would be as
fruitless as to make a shelter against the Lightning;
there are so many Inlets to the Breach, that the
Informers would be as numerous as the Crimi∣nals,
and the Trespass as frequent as the Minutes
we live in.</P>
<P>Conversation has received a general Taint, and
the Disease is become a Charm; the Way to cure
it, is not by forcible Restraints on Particulars,
but by some general Influence on the publick Pra∣ctice;
when a Distemper becomes pleasant to a
Patient, he is the harder to be cur'd; he has a sort of
Aversion to the Remedy because he has none to
the Disease. Our modern People have such a Pas∣sion
for the Mode, that if it be but the Fashion
to be Lewd, they will scandalize their Honour, de∣bauch
their Bodies, and damn their Souls to be
Gentile; if the Beaux talk Blasphemy, the rest will
set up for Athiests, and deny their Maker, to be
counted witty in the Defence of it; when our
Tradesmen would be thought wife, and make
themselves appear nice and learned in their Con∣versation,
nothing will satisfy them but to criti∣cise
upon Things sacred; run up to discuss the In∣scrutables
of Religion; search the Arcana even of
Heaven itself: The Divinity of the Son of God,
the hypostatick Union, the rational Description of
the State Everlasting, nay, the Demonstrations of
undemonstrable Things, are the common Subject of
their fancied affected Capacities.</P>
<P>Hence come Heresies and Delusions, Men af∣fecting
to search into what is impossible they should
clearly discover, learn to doubt, because they can∣not
describe, and deny the Existence because they
cannot explain the Manner of what they enquire
after; as if a thorow impossibility of their acting
by their Sense upon Objects beyond its Reach, was
<PB N="89" REF="105"/>
an Evidence against their Being. Thus because the
Trinity cannot appear to their Reasoning, they
oppose their Reasoning to its Reality; they will
divest the Son of God of his Divinity, and of the
hypostatick Union of the Godhead in the Person
of Christ, because they cannot distinguish between
the Actions done by him in his Mediatorial Capa∣city,
in Virtue of his Office, and those Actions,
which he did in Virtue of his Omnipotence and
Godhead.</P>
<P>This is not an Immorality and Error in Conver∣sation
only, or not so much, so as I think it is a Judg∣ment
upon it, a Blast from Heaven upon the Arro∣gance
of the Tongue; when proud Men give
themselves a Loose to talk Blasphemously to be
thought witty, their Maker gives them up to
suggest damnable Errors till they begin to believe
them, and to broach their own wicked Hints, till
they by Custom learn to espouse and defend
them, as Children tell feigned Stories till they be∣lieve▪
them to be true. If our Town Fopperies
were visible only in the little Excursions of Dress
and Behaviour, it would be Satisfaction enough
for a wise Man, either to pity or laugh at them;
but when Wit is set on work, and Invention rack'd
to find out Methods, how they may be more than
superlatively wicked, when all the Endowments
of the Mind and Helps of Art, with the Accom∣plishments
of Education are rang'd in Battel a∣gainst
Heaven, and joyn'd in Confederacy to make
Mankind more wicked, than ever the Devil had
the Impudence to desire of them; This calls out
aloud for the Help of all the Powers of Govern∣ment,
and all the Strength of Wit and Virtue to
detect and expose it.</P>
<P>Indeed I had some Thoughts to leave upon Re∣cord
a melancholly kind of Genealogy, of this
<PB N="90" REF="106"/>
horrid Perfection of Vice, which so increases i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
our Age, I mean as it respects this Nation, in
which 'tis too ancient indeed to trace it back to its
Original; yet since its visible Increase has been
within the reach of our own Memory, and 'tis as
I may say, the adopted Child of our Age, we
may judge of the Extent of its Influence, and may
take a short View of it in Miniature. None indeed
can judge of the Extent of its Influence, but such
as have conversed with all Sorts of People, from
the Court to the Plough-tail, where you may too
sadly see the Effect of it, in the general debauch∣ing
both the Principles and Practice of all Sorts
and Degrees of this Nation: But it will be an
ungrateful Task, 'twould lead me to the Chara∣cters
of Persons, and to write Satyrs upon the
Times, as well those past, as these present, which
indeed is not my Business in this Work; and
therefore I throw by some keen Observations
which I had made upon this Subject, my Business
here, or at least my Design being rather to instruct
the Age, than to reproach it; and as for the Dead,
<HI>they are gone to their Place.</HI></P>
<P>St. <HI>Augustin</HI> observes, <HI>de Civitate dei,</HI> that the An∣cients
justified their Liberty in all Excesses of
Vice, which they practised in those Times from
the Patterns of their Gods, that the Stories of
the Rapes and Incest of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> the Lewdness of
<HI>Venus</HI> and <HI>Mars,</HI> and the like, made those Crimes
appear less heinous, since People had them fre∣quent
in the Histories of the Deities they wor∣shipped;
and that they must of Necessity be law∣ful,
seeing they were practised by those famous
Persons, who they had placed above the Skyes and
thought fit to adore.</P>
<P>If modern Times have received unhappy Im∣pressions
from vicious Courts; and Princes, have
<PB N="91" REF="107"/>
not taken the needful Caution not to guide to Evil
by their Example; instead of turning this into
Satyr upon those that are past, I choose to give it
another Turn, which our Kings and People too
in Time to come may make good Use of, and I
hope will not be offended at supposing that they
will do so.</P>
<P>1. To Kings or Sovereigns in future Reigns;
for I am not in this intending the present
Reign; it may without Offence be said, that
they have a glorious Advantage put into their
Hands, to Honour their Maker, and advan∣tage
their People, to the immortal Glory of
their own Memory, by prompting Virtue and
discouraging Vice by their happy Examples;
by removing the vicious Habits of Conver∣sation
from the Court-Modes, and making
Vice unfashionable as it is unseemly; why
may not the Royal Example go as far to re∣form
a Nation, as it has formerly done to
debauch and ruin it? But as this respects the
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This was all Written in King <HI>William</HI>'s Reign and refers to that Time.</NOTE> Heads of the People, I desire to speak it
with the Deference of a Subject, and close
this Discourse with only saying, that I pray
and wish it may be so.</P>
<P>2. To the People with more Freedom I apply
it thus; Let past Examples be what they will,
the present Reign encourages no Crime, why
then should our modern Conversation receive
this Taint? why should we be Voluntiers in
the Devil's Service? while the Power we are
under gives us neither Precept or Example;
if we are Guilty, 'tis by meer Choice, the
Crime is all our own, and we are Patterns
to our selves.</P>

<HEAD>2. Of reforming the Errors of Con∣versation.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>UT I leave this Part as less grateful,
and perhaps not more significant than
what I have yet to say upon this Sub∣ject;
'tis not so absolutely material to
inquire how his Conversation came first to be cor∣rupted,
as how it shall be reform'd or recovered.
The Question before us is, by what Method to re∣trieve
this miserable Defection, and to bring back
the Nation to some tolerable Degree of good
Manners, that Morality at least may regain its
Authority, and Virtue, and Sobriety be valued
again as it ought to be; this, I say, is a diffi∣cult
Thing to direct.</P>

<P>The Method might be easier prescrib'd than

something may however be said by way of Ob∣servation,
perhaps other Well-wishers, may hereafter
<PB N="93" REF="109"/>
throw their Mites into this Treasury, and some
zealous Reformers may at last make the Attempt
upon these Foundations.</P>
<P>1. A strict Execution of the Laws against Vice;
we have already, and are every Day making very
good Laws to reform the People: But the Benefit of
Laws consists in the executive Power, which if not
vigorously put forth, Laws become useless, and it
were better they were not made at all. I was once
going to have added here a Treatise, entituled, an
Essay upon the Insignificancy of Laws and Acts of
Parliament in <HI>England;</HI> but upon second Thoughts,
resolving to mingle no Satyr with my serious Ob∣servations,
I omitted this also. The Deficiency
of our Laws, is chiefly in the Want of Laws
to reform the Law-makers, that the Wheel of exe∣cutive
Justice might be kept going; Of what
Use else can Laws be?</P>
<P>(2) An exemplar Behaviour in our Gentry, after
whose Copy the poor People generally write;
not but that I acknowledge it will be harder,
to reform a Nation, than it would to debauch
it; though Virtue should obtain upon Cu∣stom;
and become the Fashion, because Incli∣nation
does not stand neuter; but it would be
a great Step to this Reformation, if we could
all joyn to discourage Immorality by Example;
That if a Man will be drunk or lewd, he shall
<HI>as a Thief robs a House,</HI> do it in the Dark, and
be ashamed of it. If these two Heads were
brought to pass, I question not but Reformation
would come to such an heighth, that if a poor
Man happened to be drunk, he should come and
desire the Constable to set him in the Stocks, for fear
of worse Punishment; and if a rich Man
swore an Oath in his Passion, he should send his
Footman to the next Justice of the Peace with his
<PB N="94" REF="110"/>
Fine, and get a Discharge for fear of being in∣form'd
against and expos'd.</P>
<P>In order to the furthering this great Work, it
would be very necessary, if possible, to draw the
Picture of our modern Vices, to let Mankind see
by a true Light what they are doing, and how
ugly a Phyz the Mistress they court really appears
with, when Inclination which paints her in diffe∣rent
Colours is taken off.</P>
<P>'Twill be impossible to bring Vice out of Fa∣shion,
if we cannot bring Men to an Understand∣ing
of what it really is: But could we prevail up∣on
a Man to examine his Vice, to dissect its Parts,
and view the Anatomy of it; to see how disagree∣able
it is to him as a Man, as a Gentleman, or as
a Christian; how despicable and contemptible in
its highest Fruition, how destructive to his Senses,
Estate, and Reputation; how dishonourable, and how
beastly, in its publick Appearances, such a Man
would certainly be out of Love with it, and be
but Mankind once out of love with Vice, the Re∣formation
is half brought to pass.</P>
<P>I shall not pretend to invade the Province of
the Learned, nor offer one Argument from Scrip∣ture
or Providence; for I am supposed to be talk∣ing
to Men that doubt or deny them both. Divi∣nity
is not my Talent, nor ever like to be my
Profession, the Charge of Priestcraft and School∣men
would not lie against me; besides, 'tis not
the way of talking that the World relishes at this
Time; in a Word, talking Scripture is out of
Fashion: But I must crave leave to tell my Rea∣der,
that if there were no God or Providence,
Devil or future State, yet they ought not to be
Drunken and Lewd, Passionate, Revengeful or
Immoral; 'tis so Unnatural, so Unruly, so Ingen∣teel,
so Foolish and Foppish, that no wise Man as
<PB N="95" REF="111"/>
a Man can justify it so much as to his own Rea∣son,
or the Memory of his Ancestors. I suppose
my self talking to Men that have nothing to do
with God, and desire he should have nothing to
do with them; and yet even to such, a vicious
Conversation, look'd on without the Gust of Incli∣nation,
would appear too brutish to be meddled
with, if we will but choose <HI>like Men,</HI> not to say
<HI>like Christians;</HI> Virtue and Morality is more
agreeable to human Nature, more manly than
Vice and Intemperance; 'tis more suitable to all
the Ends of Life, to the Being of Society, to the
publick Peace of Families, as well as Nations.
Mankind would rather be virtuous than vicious,
if they were to choose only for their own Case and
Convenience; Vice tends to Oppression, War
and Confusion; Virtue is peaceable and honest;
Vice is a Poison to Society, no Man is safe if
Men have neither Sobriety or Honesty; for the
Innocent will be robb'd by the Thief, ravisht by
the Lewd, and murther'd by the Drunkard.</P>
<P>It might not be a needless Digression if I should
examine here, whether Whoring and Drunkenness
be not the two Mother Sins of the Times, the
Spring and Original of all our fashionable Vices;
I distinguish this because other Sins, as Mudrers,
Thefts, Rapes and the like, are now come so
much in Vogue; we are content the Laws should
be executed for them, but should think it very
hard a Man shou'd be hang'd for Whoring, or
transported for being Drunk.</P>
<P>I would not have any of our Gentlemen think,
that my laying the Charge of our Debauchery
on the Examples of the Gods, has taken off any
Thing of the Blame from those who have indu∣striously
propogated the spreading Evil, among
their Tenants and Neighbours, by their own vi∣cious
<PB N="96" REF="112"/>
Example; and I could turn the whole Obser∣vation
into a Satyr on the Manners of our Gen∣tlemen,
and describe with what Easiness our
Magistrates let fall the Reins of their Authority,
and connive at the Practice of all manner of In∣temperance
and Excess among the People; with
what Eagerness the poor Country-men are call'd
in to be made drunk upon every Occasion; with
what Contempt any Person is look'd upon either
in Town or Country, that either will not be
drunk, or cannot bear an excessive Quantity of
Wine: How our common Mirth is fill'd with
Songs and Poems, recommending Drunkenness and
Lewdness, and rampant Vice rides Riot through
the Nation. But as above I avoid Satyr, I shall
endeavour to treat this foul Subject, in as civil
Terms as the Case will bear, and only examine
general Conversation in particular Heads, with some
vulgar Errors of Behaviour which are crept in, and
which seem authorized by Custom.</P>

that something was superior, whose Influence go∣vern'd,
and whose being was Sacred and to be

Assurance he has of the Negative, and what a
Risque he runs if he should be mistaken? This we
are sure of, if we want Demonstration to prove
the Being of a God, they are much more at a
Loss for a Demonstration to prove the Negative.
Now no Man can Answer it to his Prudence, to
take the Risque they run, upon an uncertain suppo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tious
Notion; for if there be such a Thing as a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irst Cause, which we call God, they have very
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ittle Reason to expect much from him, who have
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ade it their Business to affront him by denying
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Existence. Nor have they acted in their De∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>al
like wise Men, for they have not used so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch
as the Caution of good Manners, but as
<PB N="100" REF="116"/>
if they were as sure of his Non-entity, as of the
strongest Demonstration, they have been witty
upon the Thing, and made a jest of the Supposi∣tion,
turn'd all Matters of Faith into Ridicule,
burlesqu'd upon Religion it self, and made Bal∣lads
and Songs on the Bible; thus <HI>Rochester</HI> has
lett us a long <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ewd Song, beginning thus:
<Q><L>Religion's a Politick Cheat</L>
<L>Made up of many a Fable,</L>
<L>Ne're trouble the Wise or the Great,</L>
<L>But only amuses the Rabble.</L></Q></P>
<P>Now, I am not in this Discourse entring into any
of the Arguments in these grand Questions on one
side or other, that would be to make this Work
a Collection of Polemicks; nor am I Casuist enough
for such a Work; but I am observing or remarking
upon the Wickedness of the treating these Subjects
with Levity and Ignorance in the common Road
of Conversation.</P>
<P>Methinks these Gentlemen act with more Courage
than Discretion; for if it should happen at last,
that there should be a God, and that he has the
Power of Rewards and Punishments in his Hand,
as he must have or cease to be Almighty, they are
but in an ill Case.</P>
<Q><L>If it should so fall out, as who can tell,</L>
<L>But there may be a God, a Heaven, a Hell,</L>
<L>Mankind had best consider well for fear,</L>
<L>T'shou'd be too late when their Mistakes appear.</L></Q>
<P>Nor do they in my Opinion discover any great
Wit in it; there is if I might pass for a Judge,
<PB N="101" REF="117"/>
something flat, something that shocks the Fancy,
in all the Satyr upon Religion that ever I saw; as
if the Muse were not so much an Atheist as the
Poet, but ba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ks the Hint, and could not favour a
blasphemous Flight with so much Freedom and
Spirit that at other. Times it has shown; which is
a Notice that there is a <HI>tacit</HI> Sense of the Deity,
though they pretend to deny it lodg'd in the Un∣derstanding,
that it is not stifled without some
Difficulty, and struggles hard with the Fancy,
when the Party strive, to be more than ordinary
Insolent with his Maker.</P>
<P>In the next Place as 'tis one of the worst Immorali∣ties
of Conversation when it is prophane, so Blasphe∣my
is the Extream of Prophaneness; you cannot
come into Company with an Atheist, but you have
it in his common Discourse; he is always putting
some Banter or foolish Pun upon Religion, affront∣ing
the invisible Power, or ridiculing his Maker;
all his Wit runs out into it, as all Diseases run, into
the Plague in a Time of Infection, and you must
have Patience to hear it or quarrel with him.</P>
<P>Below these we have a Sort of People who will
acknowledge a God, but he must be such a one
as they please to make him; a fine well bred good
natur'd Gentleman like Deity, that cannot have
the Heart to damn any of his Creatures to an
Eternal Punishment, nor could not be so weak as
to let the <HI>Jews</HI> crucify his own Son; these Men ex∣pose
Religion, and all the Doctrines of Repentance,
and Faith in Christ, with all the Means of a
Christian Salvation, as matter of Banter and Ridi∣cule.
The Bible they say is a good History in
most Parts, but the Story of our Saviour they look
upon as a meer Novel, and the Miracles of the
New Testament as a Legend of Priestcraft.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="118"/>
Further, besides these we have <HI>Arians</HI> and <HI>So∣cinians,</HI>
the Disciples of an ancient Heretick, who
went out of the Chutch always at the singing
the <HI>Gloria Patri,</HI> that he might be out of the
Noise, and would sit down at the Doxology of
the Prayers, to note his disowning the Godhead of
Jesus Christ.</P>
<P><HI>These are Iniquities,</HI> as <HI>Job</HI> said, <HI>should be punished by
the Judges,</HI> cap. xxii. v. xx. and these are the Things
which have given such a Stroke to the Ruin of
the Nation's Morals; for no Method can be so
direct to prepare People for all Sorts of Wicked∣ness,
as to perswade them out of a Belief of any
supreme Power to restrain them; make a Man
once cease to believe a God, and he has nothing
left to limit his Appetite but meer Philosophy; if
there is no supreme Judicature, he must be his
own Judge and his own Law, and will be so; the
Notion of Hell, Devil, and Infernal Spirits are
empty Things, and have nothing of Terror in
them, if the Belief of a Power superior to them
be obliterated.</P>
<P>But to bring this particular Case nearer to the
Point of Conversation, the Errors of which lie
before me; though we live in an Age where these
horrid Degrees of Impiety are too much practised;
yet we live in a Place where Religion is professed,
the Name of God owned and worshipped, Reli∣ligion
and the Doctrines of Christianity esta∣blished;
and as it is so, it ought as much to be
preserved by the Civil Power, from the horrid In∣vasion
of Atheists, Deists and Hereticks, as the
Publick Peace, ought to be defended against Free∣booters,
Thieves, and Invaders.</P>
<P>'Tis very improbable any Reformation of Man∣ners
should be brought to pass, if the debauching
the religious Principles of the Nation, goes on
<PB N="103" REF="119"/>
with an unrestrain'd Liberty. How incongruous
is it to the Decoration of Government, that a Man
shall be punished for Drunkenness, and set in the
Stocks for Swearing, but shall have Liberty to de∣ny
the God of Heaven, and dispute against the
very Sum and Substance of the Christian Doctrine,
shall banter the Scripture, and make Ballads of the
Pentateuch, turn all the Principles of Religion,
the Salvation of the Soul, the Death of our Savi∣our,
and the Revelation of the Gospel, into Ridi∣cule?
And shall we pretend to Reformation of
Manners, and suppressing Immoralities, while
such as this, is the general Mixture of Conversa∣tion?
If a Man talk against the Government, or
speak scurrilously of the King, he is had to the
<HI>Old Bayly,</HI> and from thence to the Pillory, or
Whipping-Post, and 'tis fit it should be so: But
he may speak Treason against the Majesty of Hea∣ven,
deny the Godhead of his Redeemer, and make
a Jest of the Holy Ghost, and thus affront the
Power we all adore, and yet pass with Impunity;
perhaps some in the Company may have Courage
enough to blame him, 2nd vindicate their Reli∣gion
with a <HI>Why do ye talk so?</HI> But where is the
Man, or the Magistrate, that ever vindicated the
Honour of his Maker, with a Resentment beco∣ming
the Crime? If a Man give the Lie to a
Gentleman in Company, he takes it as an Af∣front,
flies into a Passion, quarrels, fights, and
perhaps murders him; nay, some have done it for
an absent Friend, whom they have heard abused:
But where is the Gentleman that ever thought
himself so much concern'd in the Quarrel of his
Maker, but that he could hear him affronted,
his Being deny'd, the Lie given to h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s divine Au∣thority,
nay, to his divine Being, and all his
Commands ridicul'd and expos'd, without any
<PB N="104" REF="120"/>
Motion of Spirit to punish the Insolence of the
Party, and without drawing his Sword in the
Quarrrel, or letting him know he does not like it.</P>
<P>Methinks, I need not make an Apology for
this, as if I meant, that Quarrelling and Fighting
were a proper Practice in the Case; the Law does
not admit it in any Case; nor is it reasonable it
should, and God Almighty is far from desiring
us to run any Risque in his Service: But I chuse
to bring the Cases into a Parallel, to signify, that
I think 'tis a vulgar Error in our Behaviour, not
to show our Resentment, when we hear the Ho∣nour
and Essence of God slighted and denied, his
Majesty abused, and Religion banter'd and ridi∣cul'd
in common Discourses. I think it would
be very reasonable, to tell a Gentleman he wants
Manners, when he talks reproachfully of his Ma∣ker,
and to use him scurvily if he resented it. It
would very well become a Man of Quality to
cane a lew'd Fop, or kick him down Stairs, when
his Insolence took a Loose at Religion in his Com∣pany,
else Men may be bullied out of their Chri∣stianity,
and lampoon'd into Prophaneness, for
Fear of being counted Fools.</P>
<P>Besides, 'tis in in this as in all other like Cases;
he that will talk atheistically in my Company, ei∣ther
believes me to be an Atheist like himself, or
ventures to impose upon me; and by imposing
upon me, either accounts me a Fool that can't
tell when I am put upon, or a Coward that dare
not resent it.</P>
<P>Upon which Account, even in good Manners,
it ought to be avoided; for it can't be intro∣duc'd
into any Part of Conversation, where the
Company are not all alike, without the greatest
Affront upon the rest that can be offered them.</P>

<HEAD>4. Of Lewd and Immodest Discourse,</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Alking Bawdy, that Sodomy of the
Tongue has the most of ill Manners, and
the least of a Gentleman in it, of any
Part of common Discourse. Sir <HI>George
Mackenzie</HI> has very handsomely expos'd it in its
proper Colours: But it may not be an Intrench∣ment
at all upon his Province, to say something
to it in these Observations.</P>
<P>This Part is the puculiar Practice of such Person
as are hardened to a Degree beyond other Men;
Proficients in Debauchery, whose Lives are so con∣tinually
devoted to Lewdness, that their Mouths
cannot contain it; who can govern their Tongues
no better than their Tails, and are willing to be
thought what really they are. In these, it is
neither so strange, nor so much a Crime as in o∣thers;
these are Persons not to be reclaim'd. This
Part of my Observation is not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esigned for their
Use; they are not to be talk'd out of their Vice;
they must go on and run their Length: Nothing
but a Goal or an Hospital ever brings them to a
Reformation; they repent sometimes in that Em∣blem
of Hell, a fluxing House, and under the Sur∣geons
Hands, wish a little they had been wiser;
but they follow one Sin with another, till their
Carcass stinks as bad as their Discourse, and the
Body becomes too nasty, for the Soul to stay any
longer in it: From these no Discourse is to be ex∣pected,
but what is agreeable to the Tenor of
their Lives; for them to talk otherwise, would be
strain'd and excentrick, and become them as lit∣tle,
<PB N="106" REF="122"/>
as it would be tedious to them; but for a
Gentleman, a Man of seeming Modesty, and a
Man of Behaviour, not arriv'd to that Class in
the Devil's School, for such a one to mix his Dis∣course
with lew'd and filthy Expressions, has
something in it of a Figure, which inrends more
than is express'd.</P>
<P>Either we must believe such a one to be very
lew'd in his Practice; or else, that not being
able yet to arrive to such a Degree of Wickedness
as he desires, he would supply that Defect with a
Cheat, and perswade you to believe he is really
worse than he is.</P>
<P>Which of these two Characters I would chuse to
wear, I cannot tell; for he that desires to be worse
than he thinks he is, is certainly as bad as he de∣sires
to be; and he that is so bad as to let fly the
Excrescencies of it at his Mouth, is as wicked
as the Devil can in Reason desire of him.</P>
<P>But I descend from the Wickedness to the Inde∣cency
of the Matter; its being a Sin against God,
is not so much the present Argument, as its being
unmannerly, a Sin against Breeding, and Society,
a Breach of Behaviour, and a saucy insolent Af∣front
to all the Company.</P>
<P>I do not deny, but that Modesty, as it respects
the Covering our Bodies, was at first an Effect of
the Fall of our Parents into Crime, and is there∣fore
said still to be the Consequences of criminal
Nature, and no Virtue in itself, because no Part
of the Body had been unfit to be exposed, if
Vice had not made the Distinction necessary.</P>
<P>But from this very Argument, lewd Discourse ap∣pears
to be a Sin against Custom and Decency; for
why must the Tongue industriously expose Things
and Actions at which Nature blushes, and which
Custom, <HI>let the Original be what it will,</HI> has dedi∣cated
<PB N="107" REF="123"/>
to Privacy and Retirement? What if
it be true, that Shame is the Consequence of Sin,
and that Modesty is not an original Virtue; it
cannot but be allowed, that Sin has thereby
brought us to a Necessity of making Modesty be
a Virtue, and Sin would have a double Influence
upon us, if after it had made us asham'd, it should
make us not asham'd again.</P>
<P>'Tis in my Opinion a Mistake, when we say,
Sin was the immediate Cause of Shame; 'twas Sin
indeed gave a Nudity to our Natures and Acti∣ons;
the Innocence which serv'd as a Glory and
Covering, being gone, then Shame came in as
the Effect of the conscious Sinner; so the Text
says, <HI>They knew that they were naked:</HI> Shame was
the Effect of Nakedness, as Nakedness was the
Effect of Sin.</P>
<P>From hence then I argue, and this is the Rea∣son
of my naming it, That to be asham'd of our
Nakedness, is a Token of our Wisdom, and a
Monument of our just Sense of the first Sin that
made it so, and as much a Duty now, as any
other Part of our Repentance.</P>
<P>To give the Tongue then a Liberty in that which
there is so much Reason to blush at, argues no
Sense of the Original Degeneracy. Where is
the Man that partakes not of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Fall, has
no vicious contracted Habit and Nature convey'd
to him from his Grand-Predecessor? Let him
come forth, let him go naked, and live by himself,
and let his Posterity partake of his Innocence;
his Tongue cannot offend, nothing can be inde∣cent
for him to say, nothing uncomely for him
to see.</P>
<P>But if these Gentlemen think it proper to cover
their Nakedness with their Clothes, methinks
they should not be always uncovering it again
<PB N="108" REF="124"/>
with their Tongues; if there are some needful
Things, which Nature requires to be done in se∣cret,
and which they by Inclination chuse to act
in Private: What Reason can they give for speak∣ing
of them in Publick.</P>
<P>There is a strange Incongruity in the Behaviour
of these People, that they fill their Months with
the foul Repetition of Actions, and Things which
their own Practicing in Private condems them for,
nay, which they would be asham'd to do in Pub∣lick;
such Men ought to act the common Require∣ments
of Nature, in the most publickest Places of
the Streets, bring their Wives or Whores to the
Exchange, and to the Market Places, and lye
with them in the Street, or else hold their Tongues,
and let their Mouths have no more the Stench of
their Vices in Publick, than their Actions.</P>
<P>And why of all the rest of the Parts of Life,
must the Tongue take a peculiar Licence to re∣vel
thus upon Nature? as if she had a Mind to
reproach her with the Infirmities she labours un∣der:
The Customs we are obliged to, tho' they are
Cloggs upon Nature, and a Badge of original
Defection; yet neither is there any thing so odi∣ous,
or so burdensome, that these Gentlemen
should triumph over the Nurse that brought them
up.</P>
<P>Take the lewdest and most vicious Wretch that
ever gave his Tongue a Loose in this hateful Pra∣ctice,
and turn him about to his Mother, you shall
hardly prevail upon him to talk his lewd Language
to her; there is something nauseous and surfeiting
in that Thought. This talking Bawdy, is like
a Man going to debauch his own Mother; for
'tis raking into the <HI>Arcana,</HI> and exposing the Na∣kedness
of Nature, the common Mother of us all.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="125"/>
If, as a famous Man of Wit pretended, lying
with a Woman was <HI>the homliest thing that Man can
do;</HI> 'tis much more true, that talking of it is the
homliest thing that Man can say.</P>
<P>Nor is there <HI>to me</HI> any Jest in these things, no
Appearance of Mirth: There may be some Plea∣sure
in wicked Actions, as the World rates Plea∣sure,
but I must profess 'tis dull, and for Want of
other more regular Tastes, that there should be
Pleasure in the Discourse: 'Tis a prophaning of
Nature, and bringing forth those Things she has
hallowed to Secresy and Retirement, to the scan∣dalous
Indecency of publick Banter and Jest.</P>
<P>But Men, who have always something to say
for their Folly, tell us, 'tis Custom only which
has made any of these things uncommon; and
there's no Sin in speaking that which there is no
Sin in doing.</P>
<P>Let us grant them, that Custom only has done
this: But if Custom has made these things uncom∣mon,
and conceal'd, or at least, banish'd them
from the Voice of Conversation. 'Tis a Sin then
against Custom to expose them again. Lawful
Customs become allowed Virtues, and ought to
be preserved. Custom is a good Reason in such
Concealments; if Custom has lock'd them up, let
them remain so; at least, till you can give a bet∣ter
Reason for calling them abroad again, than
Custom has given for restraining them. Custom
has made these things uncommon, because that
Sin, which first made Nature naked, left her so
captivated, by some of her Parts more than others,
that she could not but blush at those, where Sin
had taken up its peculiar Residence. Now, as I
noted before, no Man can with any tolerable Satis∣faction,
expose the Parts, till he has first abstra∣cted
and separated the Sin, which having possess'd
<PB N="110" REF="126"/>
them, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them at first with Shame: He
that can do this, may go naked, and talk any
thing.</P>
<P>And for the same Reason, no Man can justify
talking lewd<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that at the same Time
thro'vs away his Clothes, for to cover himself
with his Hands, and uncover himself with his
Tongue, are Contradictons in their own Nature,
and one condemns the other▪ He that scorns the
Decency of Words, should also scorn the Decen∣cy
of Clothes, let his Body be as bald as his
Discourse, and let him scorn the Shame of one, as
well as the Shame of the other.</P>
<P>It is no Sin, they say, to talk of, what it is no
Sin to do; and I may add, 'tis no Sin at all to
shew, what 'tis no Sin to describe. Why is the
Eye to be less offended than the Ear, since both are
but the common Organs of the Understanding?</P>
<P>But the Weather and Inconveniencies of the
Climate, are urged for clothing our Bodies, and
I urge, Decency and good Manners for the Go∣vernment
of our Tongues;
and let any one con∣tend
it with me, that thinks he can prove, that
the Obligation of the first is greater than the
Obligation of the last.</P>
<P>Much more might be said to this, but I make
but an Essay, and am unwilling to run out into a

<HEAD>Of Talking falsly.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>Y Talking falsly, I do not design to enter
upon a long Dissertation upon the Sin
of Lying in general, I suppose all Men
that read me will acknowledge Lying to
be one of the most scandalous Sins between Man
and Man; a Crime of a deep Dye, and of an ex∣tensive
Nature leading into innumerable Sins;
That is, as Lying is practised to deceive, to in∣jure,
betray, rob, destroy, and the like. Lying
in this Sense is the concealing of all other Crimes,
'tis the Sheeps Clothing hung upon the Wolves
back, 'tis the Pharisee's Prayer, the Whore's Blush,

Thief's Cloke, 'tis <HI>Joab</HI>'s Embrace, and <HI>Judas</HI>'s
Kiss; in a Word, 'tis Mankind's Darling-Sin,
and the Devil's distinguishing Character.</P>
<P>But this is not the Case I am upon, this is not
the talking falsly I am upon, but a strange Liberty
which (particularly in Conversation) People take
to talk falsly, <HI>without charging themselves with any
Offence in it, either against God or Man:</HI> This is to be
considered in two or there Parts, not but that it has
many more.</P>
<P>1. The Liberty of telling Stories, <HI>a common
Vice in Discourse;</HI> the main End of this extraordi∣nary
Part of Tittle Tattle, is to divert the Com∣pany,
and make them laugh; but we ought to con∣sider,
whether that very empty Satisfaction either <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
ourselves or Friends, is to be purchased at so
<PB N="112" REF="128"/>
great an Expence as that of Conscience, and of
a Dishonour done to Truth.</P>
<P>'Tis <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>arce fit to say, how far some People go
in this Folly, to call it no worse, even till some∣times
they bring the general Credit of their
Conversation into decay, and People that are used
to them, learn to lay no Stress upon any Thing
they say.</P>
<P>For once we will suppose a Story to be in its
Substance true, yet to what monstrous a Bulk
doth it grow, by that frequent Addition put to
it in the Relation, till not only it comes to be im∣probable,
but even impossible to be true; and the
ignorant Relator is so tickled with having made
a good Story of it, whatever it was when he
found it, that he is blind to the Absurdities and
Inconsistencies of Fact in Relation, and tells it
with a full Face, even to those that are able
to confute it, by proving it to be impossible.</P>
<P>I once heard a Man who would have taken it
very ill to be thought a Lyar, tell a Story, the
Facts of which were impossible to be true; and yet
assert it with so much Assurance, and declare so
positively, that he had been an Eye-Witness of it
himself, that there was nothing to do but in respect
to the Man, <HI>let him alone and say nothing.</HI> A
Gentleman who sat by, and whose good Breeding
restrained his Passion, turn'd to him, and said, did
you see this Thing done Sir? yes, I did Sir, says
Relator: <HI>Well Sir,</HI> replies the Gentleman, <HI>since you
affirm that you did see it, I am bound in regard to you
to believe it; but upon my Word,</HI> 'tis such a Thing,
<HI>that if I had seen it my self, I would not have believed
it:</HI> This broke the Silence, set all the Company a
laughing, and exposed the Falshood, more than
down right telling him it was a Lye, which might
besides have made a Broil about it.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="129"/>
'Tis a strange Thing, that we cannot be con∣tent
to tell a Story as it is, but we must take from
it on one Side, or add to it on another; till the
Fact is lost among the <HI>Addenda,</HI> and till in Time even
the Man himself remembring it only as he told it
last, really forgets how it was Originally; this
being so generally practised now, nothing is more
common, than to have two Men tell the same
Story quite differing one from another, yet both
of them Eye-Witnesses to the Fact related. These
are that sort of People, who having once told a
Story falsly, tell it so often in the same or like
manner, till they really believe it to be true.</P>
<P>This supplying a Story by Invention, is certainly
a most scandalous Crime and yet very little regarded
in that Part, it is a sort of Lying that makes a great
Hole in the Heart, at which by Degrees a Habit
of Lying enters in: Such a Man comes quick∣ly
up, to a total disregarding the Truth of what he
says, looking upon it as a Trifle, a Thing of no
import, whether any Story he tells be true or no,
so it but commands the Company as they call it;
that is to say, procures a Laugh, or a kind of Amaze∣ent
Things equally agreeable to these Story-Tellers;
for the Business is to affect the Com∣pany,
either startle them with something wonder∣ful,
never heard of before; or make them laugh
immoderately, as at something prodigiously ta∣king,
witty, and diverting.</P>
<P>It is hard to place this Practice in a Station e∣qual
to its Folly, 'tis a Meanness below the Digni∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y
of common Sense: They that lye to gain, to
deceive, to deludes, to betray as above, have some
End in thei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Wickedness; and though they can∣not
give the Design for an excuse of their Crime,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et it may be given as the Reason and Founda∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion
of it: But to lye for Sport, for <HI>Fun, as the

Boys express it,</HI> is to play at Shuttle-cock with your
Soul, and load your Conscience for the meer fake
of being a Fool, and the making A meer Buffoonry
of a Story, the Pleasure of what is below even
Madness itself.</P>
<P>And yet, how common is this Folly? How
is it the Character of some Men's Conversation,
that they are made up of Story? And how mean
a Figure is it they bear in Company? Such Men
always betray their Emptiness by this, and ha∣ving
only a certain Number of Tales in their
Budget, like a Pedlar with his Pack, they can
only at every House shew the same Ware over
again, tell the same Story over and over, 'till the
Jest is quite worn out; and to convince us, that
much of it, <HI>if not all,</HI> is born of Invention, they
seldom tell it the same Way twice, but vary it
even in the most material Facts: So that though
it may be remembred, that it was the same Story,
it ought never to be remembred, that it was told
by the same Man.</P>
<P>With what Temper should I speak of these
People? What Words can express the Meanness
and Baseness of the Mind, that can do thus? that sin
without Design, and not only have no End in
the View, but even no Reflection in the Act: the
Folly is grown up to a Habit, and they not only
mean no Ill, but indeed mean nothing at all in it.</P>
<P>It is a strange Length that some People
run in this Madness of Life, and it is so odd, so
unaccountable, that indeed 'tis difficult to describe
the Man, tho' not difficult to describe the Fact▪
what Idea can be form'd in the Mind, of a Man,
who does ill without meaning ill? that wrongs
himself, affronts Truth, and imposes upon his
Friends, and yet means no Harm; or to use his own
Words, means nothing? That if he thinks any
<PB N="115" REF="131"/>
Thing, 'tis to make the Company pleasant, and
what is this but making <HI>the Circle</HI> a Stage, and
himself the Merry <HI>Andrew.</HI></P>
<P>The best Step such Men can take is to LYE
ON; <HI>and this shews the Singularity of the Crime;</HI> it
is a strange Expression, but I shall make it out; their
Way is, I say, to Lye on; 'till their Character is
compleatly known, and then they can lye no long∣er;
for he whom no Body believes, can deceive no
Body, and then the Essence of Lying is removed; for
the Description of a Lye is, that 'tis spoken to
deceive, or 'tis a Design to deceive. Now, he
that no Body believes, can never lye any more,
because no Body can be deciev'd by him. Such
a Man's Character is a Bill upon his Forehead, by
which every Body knows, <HI>Here dwells a Lying
Tongue:</HI> When every Body knows what is to be
had of him, they know what to expect; and so
no Body is deceiv'd; if they believe him after∣wards,
'tis their Fault as much as his.</P>
<P>There are a great many Sorts of those People,
who make it their Business to go about telling
Stories; it would be endless to enumerate them,
some tell formal Stories forg'd in their own Brain
without any Retrospect either on Persons or Things;
I mean, as to any particular Person, or Passage
known, or in Being, and only with the ordinary
Introduction of, <HI>There was a Man,</HI> or, <HI>there was
a Woman,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>Others again, out of the same Forge of Inven∣tion,
hammer out the very Person, Man or Wo∣man,
and begin, <HI>I knew the Man,</HI> or <HI>I knew the Wo∣man,</HI>
and these ordinarily vouch their Story with
more Assurance than others; and vouch also, that
they knew the Persons who were concern'd in it.</P>
<P>The selling or writing a Parable, or an allu∣sive
allogorick History is quite a different Case,
<PB N="116" REF="132"/>
and is always Distinguisht from this other Jest∣ing
with Truth; that it is design'd and effectually
turn'd for instructive and upright Ends, and has
its Moral justly apply'd: Such are the historical
Parables in the holy Scripture, such the Pilgrims
Progress, and such in a Word the Adventures of
your fugitive Friend, <HI>Robinson Crusoe.</HI></P>
<P>Others make no Scruple to relate real Stories
with innumerable Omissions and Additions: I
mean, Stories which have a real Existence in Fact,
but which by the barbarous Way of relating, be∣come
as romantick and false, as if they had no real
Original. These Tales, like the old Galley of
<HI>Venice,</HI> which had been so often new vamped,
doubl'd and redoubl'd, that there was not one
Piece of the first Timber in her, have been told
wrong so often, and so many Ways, 'till there
would not be one Circumstance of the real Story
left in the relating.</P>
<P>There are many more Kinds of these, such
namely, as are personal and malicious, full of
Slander and Abuse; but these are not of the
Kinds I am speaking of; the present Business is
among a Kind of white Devils, who do no
Harm or Injury to any but to themselves; they
are like the Grashopper, that spends his Time
to divert the Traveller, and does nothing but
starve himself. The Conversation of these Men
is <HI>full of Emptiness,</HI> their Words are Levity itself,
and according to the Text, they not only tell Un∣truths,
but <HI>the Truth is not in them.</HI> There is not
a settl'd Awe or Reverence of Truth upon their
Minds; 'tis a Thing of no Value to them, 'tis
not regarded in their Discourse, and they give
themselves a Liberty to be perfectly unconcern'd
about the Thing they say, or the Story they tell,
whether it be true, or no.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="133"/>
This is a most abominable Practice on another
Account, namely, that these Men make a Jest of
their Crime; they are a Sort of People that Sin
laughing; that play upon their Souls as a Man
plays upon a Fiddle, to make other People dance
and wear itself out; they may be said to make
some Sport indeed, but it is all at themselves,
they are the Hearers Comedy and their own Tra∣gedy;
and like a penitent Jack-pudding, they will
at last say, I have made others merry, but I have
been the Fool.</P>
<P>I would be glad to shame Men of common
Sense, out of this horrid Piece of Buffoonry; and
one Thing I would warn them of, namely, that
their learning to Lye so currently in Story, will
insensibly bring them to a bold entrenching upon
Truth, in the rest of their Conversation; the
Scripture Command is, <HI>Let every Man speak Truth
unto his Neighbour;</HI> if we must tell Stories, tell
them as Stories, add nothing willfully to illustrate
or set it forth in the Relation; if you doubt the
Truth of it, say so, and then every one will be at
Liberty to bel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eve their Share of it.</P>
<P>Besides, there is a spreading Evil in telling a
false Story as true, namely, that you put it into
the Mouths of others, and it continues a brooding
Forgery to the End of Time; 'tis a Chimney-corner
Romance, and has in it this distinguishing Article,
that whereas Parables, and the Inventions of Men
publish'd Historically, are once for all related,
and the Moral being drawn, the History re∣mains
allusive only, as it was intended, as in seve∣ral
Cases<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Pilgrims Progress.</NOTE> may be instanced within our Time<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The Family Instructor and others.</NOTE>
<PB N="118" REF="134"/>
and without; here the Case alters, Fraud goes unto
the World's End, for Story, never dies every Rela∣tor
Vouches it for Truth, tho' he knows nothing
of the Matter.</P>
<P>These Men know not what Foundations they
are laying for handing on the Sport of Lying, <HI>for
such they make of it</HI> to Posterity, not only leaving
the Example, but dictating the very Materials for
the Practice; like Family-Lies handed on from
Father to Son, till what begun in Forgery Ends
in History, and we make our Lies be told for
Truth, by all our Children that come after us.</P>
<P>If any Man object here, that the preceeding
Volumes of this Work seem to be hereby con∣demn'd,
and the History which I have therein
publish'd of my self, censur'd; I demand in Ju∣stice,
such Objector stay his Censure, till he sees
the End of the Scene, when all that Mystery shall
discover it self, and I doubt not, but the Work
shall abundantly justify the Design, and the De∣sign
abundantly justify the Work.</P>

<P>There is an inconsiderate Temper which reigns

<P>You may now suppose me to be arriv'd, after a
long Course of infinite Variety, on the Stage of

and that I am writing these Sheets in a Season of
my Time, when (if ever) a Man may be supposed
<PB N="120" REF="136"/>
capable of making just Reflections upon things
past, a true Judgement of things present, and
tolerable Conclusions of things to come.</P>
<P>In the Beginning of this Life of Composure; for
now, and not till now, I may say, that I begun to
live, that is to say, a sedate and compos'd Life,
I enquir'd of my self very seriously one Day, what
was the proper Business of <HI>old Age?</HI> The Answer
was very natural, and indeed return'd quick upon
me, namely, that two things were my present

<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Reflection upon things past.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Serious Application to things future.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Having resolv'd the Business of Life into these
Heads, I began immediately with the First; and
as some Times I took my Pen and Ink to disbur∣then
my Thoughts, when the Subject crowded in
fast upon me; so I have here communicated some
of my Observations for the Benefit of those that
come after me.</P>
<P>About the Time that I was upon these Enqui∣ries,
being at a Friend's House, and talking much
of my long Travels, <HI>as you know Travellers are apt
to do;</HI> I observ'd an antient Gentlewoman in the
Company listen'd with a great deal of Attention,
and as I thought, with some Pleasure, to what I
was saying: And after I had done, Pray Sir, <HI>says
she,</HI> turning her Speech to me, give me Leave to
ask you a Question or two? <HI>With all my Heart,
Madam, said I:</HI> so we began the following short
Dialogue.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray Sir, in all your Travels, can you
tell what is the World a-doing? What have you
observ'd to be the principal Business of Mankind?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="121" REF="137"/>
<SPEAKER>Rob. Cru.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly Madam, 'tis very hard to an∣swer
such a Question, the People being so diffe∣rently
employ'd, some one Way, and some another;
and particularly, according to the several Parts of
the World, thro' which our Observations are to
run, and according to the differing Manners, Cu∣stoms,
and Circumstances of the People in every
Place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Alas! Sir,</HI> that is no Answer at all to
me, because I am not a Judge of the differing
Customs and Manners of the People you may
speak of: <HI>But,</HI> Is there not one common End and
Design in the Nature of Men, which seems to
run thro' all their Actions, and to be form'd by
Nature, as the main End of Life, and by Conse∣quence
is made the chief Business of Living? Pray,
how do they spend their Time?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay; now Madam you have added a
Question to the rest, of a d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fferent Nature from
what, <HI>if I take you right,</HI> you meant at first.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Question, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why! how Mankind spend their Time;
for I cannot say, that one half of Mankind spend
their Time in what they themselves may acknow∣ledge
to be the main End of Life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, don't distinguish me out of my
Question, we may talk of what is the true End of
Life, as we understood it here in a Christian Coun∣try
another Time: But take my Question as I
offer it, What is Mankind generally a doing as their
main Business?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, the main Business that Mankind
seems to be doing, is to eat and drink, that's their
Enjoyment, and to get Food to eat is their Em∣ployment,
including a little, their eating and
devouring one another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="122" REF="138"/>
<SPEAKER>Old Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a Description of them as
Brutes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is so in the First Part, namely, their
Living to eat and drink: But in the last Part they
are worse than the Brutes; for the Brutes destroy
not their own Kind, but all prey upon a different
Species; and besides, they prey upon one another,
for Necessity, to satisfy their Hunger, and for
Food: But Man for baser Ends, such as Ava∣rice,
Envy, Revenge, and the like; devours his
own Spec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, nay, his own Flesh and Blood, as
my Lord <HI>Rochester</HI> very well expresses it.</P>
<Q><L>But judge your self, I'll bring it to the Test,</L>
<L>Which is the basest Creature, Man or Beast.</L>
<L>Birds seed on Birds, Beasts on each other Prey,</L>
<L>But Savage Man alone does Man betray,</L>
<L>Press'd by Necessity, they kill for Food,</L>
<L>Man, undoes Man, to do himself no Good.</L>
<L>With Teeth and Claws, by Nature arm'd they hunt,</L>
<L>Nature's Allowance to supply their Want:</L>
<L>But Man with Smiles, embraces, Friendship, Praise,</L>
<L>Inhumanly his Fellows Life betrays.</L>
<L>With voluntary Pains works his Distress,</L>
<L>Not for Necessity, but Wantonness.</L></Q>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>All this I believe is true; but this
does not reach my Question yet: There is cer∣tainly
something among them, which is esteemed
as more particularly the End of Life, and of Living,
than the rest; to which they apply in common,
as the main Business, and which it is alway esteem∣ed
to be their Wisdom to be employ'd in: Is there
<PB N="123" REF="139"/>
not something that is apparently the great Business
of Living?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why really, Madam, I think not. For
Example: Great Part of the World, and a
greater Part by far than we imagine, is resolv'd in∣to
the lowest Degeneracy of human Nature, I
mean the Savage Life; where the chief End of
Life seems to be meerly to eat and drink, that is
to say, to get their Food, just as the brutal Life
is employ'd, and indeed with very little Difference
between them; for except only Speech and Ido∣latry,
I see nothing in the Life of some whole Na∣tions
of People, and for ought I know, containing
Millions of Souls, in which the Life of a Lion or
an Elephant in the Desarts of <HI>Arabia,</HI> is not e∣qual.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>I could mention many things, Sir, in
which they might differ, but that is not the pre∣sent
thing I enquire about: But, pray Sir, Is not
Religion the principal Business of Mankind in all
the Parts of the World; for I think you granted
it when you nam'd Idolatry▪ which they, no doubt,
call Religion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R. C▪</SPEAKER>
<P>Really, Madam, I cannot say it is; because,
what with Ignorance on one hand, and Hypocri∣sy
on the other, 'tis very hard to know where to
find Religion in the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>You avoid my Question too laborious∣ly,
Sir, I have nothing to do either with the Ig∣norance
or Hypocrisy of the People, whether they
are blindly devout, or knavishly and designedly de∣vout,
is not the Case; but whether Religion is
not apparently the main Business of the World, the
principal apparent End of Life, and the Employ∣ment
of Mankind?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you call Religion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="124" REF="140"/>
<SPEAKER>Old Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>By Religion, I mean, the Worship∣ping
and Paying Homage to some supreme Being,
some God, <HI>known or unknown,</HI> is not to the Case,
so it be but to something counted supreme.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, Madam, there are searce any
Nations in the World so stupid, but they give Te∣stimony
to the Being of a God, and have some No∣tion
of a supreme Power.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I know also, but that is not the
main Part of my Question: But my Opinion is,
that paying a divine Worship, Acts or Homage and
Adoration, and particularly, that of Praying to
the Supreme Being, which they acknowledge, is
deriv'd to Mankind from the Light of Nature,
with the Notion or Belief itself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose Madam, you mean by the Que∣stion
then, Whether the Notion or Belief of a God
in general, and the Sense of Worship in particu∣lar,
are not one and the same natural Principle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do so, if you and I do but agree
about what we call Worship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>By Worship, I understand Adoration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>But there you and I differ again a lit∣tle;
for by Worship, I understand Supplication.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you must take them both in toge∣ther;
for some Part of the <HI>Indian</HI> Savages only
adore.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess there is much Adoration,
where there is little Supplication.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>You distinguish too nicely, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Gent</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, I do not distinguish in what
I call Worship; I alledge, that all the Adora∣tion
of those poor Savages is mere Supplication:
You say they lift up their Hands to their Idols, for
Fear they should hurt them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do say so? and it is apparent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="125" REF="141"/>
<SPEAKER>Old Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, that is the same thing, for then
they life up their Hands to him, that is to say,
pray to him not to hurt them; for all the Wor∣ship
in the World, especially the outward Per∣formance,
may be resolv'd into Supplication.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R. R.</SPEAKER>
<P>I agree with you in that, if you mean the
apparent End of Worship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why! did not your Man <HI>Friday</HI> and
the <HI>Savage</HI> Woman you tell us of, talk of their
old Idol they call'd <HI>Benamuckee?</HI> And what did
they do?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>R. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very true they did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>And did not <HI>Friday</HI> tell you they
went up to the Hills, and said <HI>O</HI> to him? Pray,
what was the Meaning of saying <HI>O</HI> to him: But
<HI>O</HI> do not hurt us; for thou art Omnipotent,
and canst kill us; <HI>O</HI> heal our Distempers; for thou
art Infinite, and can'st do all things: <HI>O</HI> give us
what we want; for thou art Bountiful; <HI>O</HI> spare
us; for thou art Merciful: And so of all the other
Conceptions of a God?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Madam, I grant all this, pray what
do you infer from it? What is the Reason of your
Question?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Sir, I have many Inferences to
draw from it for my own Observation, I do not
set up to instruct you.</P>
</SP>
<P>I thought this serious old Lady would have en∣tertain'd
a farther Discourse with me on so fruit∣ful
a Subject; but she declin'd it, and left me to
my own Meditation, which indeed she had rais'd
up to an unusual Pitch: And the first thing that
occurr'd to me, was to put me upon enquiring
after that nice thing, I ought to call Religion, in
the World; seeing really I found Reason to think,
<PB N="126" REF="142"/>
that there was much more Devotion than Religion
in the World; in a Word, much more Adoration
than Supplication: And I doubt, as I come nearer
Home, it will appear, that there is much more
Hypocrisy than Sincerity: Of which I may speak
by itself.</P>
<P>In my first Enquiries, I look'd back upon my
own Travels, and it afforded me but a melancho∣ly
Reflection, that in all the Voyages and Tra∣vels
which I have employ'd two Volumes in giving
a Relation of, I never set my Foot in a Christian
Country, no not in circling three Parts of the
Globe; for, excepting the <HI>Brasils,</HI> where the
<HI>Portug<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ese</HI> indeed profess'd the Roman-Catholick
Principles, which however, in Distinction from
Paganism, I will call the Christian Religion; I
say, except the <HI>Brasils,</HI> where also I made little
Stay, I could not be said to set Foot in a Christi∣an
Country, or a Country inhabited by Christians,
from the Bay of <HI>La'rache,</HI> and the Port of <HI>Sallee,</HI>
by the <HI>Straits</HI> Mouth, where I escap'd from Slave∣ry,
thro' the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean, the Coasts of
<HI>Africk</HI> on one Side, and of <HI>Carribbea</HI> on the <HI>Ameri∣can</HI>
Shore, on the other Side; from thence to <HI>Ma∣dagascar,
Malabar,</HI> and the Bay and City of <HI>Bon∣gale,</HI>
the Coast of <HI>Sumatra, Malacca, Siam, Cambo∣dia,
Cochinchina,</HI> the Empire and Coast of <HI>China,</HI>
the Desarts of <HI>Karakathay,</HI> the <HI>Mongul Tartars,</HI> the
<HI>Siberian,</HI> the <HI>Samoiede Barbarians,</HI> and till I came
within four or five Days of <HI>Arch-Angel</HI> in the <HI>Black
Russia.</HI></P>
<P>It is, I say, a melancholy Reflection to think,
how all these Parts of the World, and with infinite
Numbers of Millions of People, furnish'd with the
Powers of Reason, and Gifts of Nature, and ma∣ny
Ways, if not every Way, as capable of the
Reception of sublime things, as we are, are yet
<PB N="127" REF="143"/>
abandon'd to the grossest Ignorance and Depra∣vity;
and that not in Religion only, but even in
all the desirable Parts of humane Knowledge,
and especially Science and acqui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d Knowledge.</P>
<P>What the Divine Wisdom has determined con∣cerning
the Souls of so many Millions, it is hard
to conclude, nor is it my present Design to en∣quire;
but this I may be allow'd here, as a Re∣mark:
If they are received to Mercy in a Fu∣ture
State, according to the Opinion of some,
as having not sin'd against saving Light, then their
Ignorance and Pagan Darkness is not a Curse, but
a Felicity; and there are no unhappy People in
the World, but those lost among Christians, for
their Sins against reveal'd Light; nay, then being
born in the Regions of Christian Light, and un∣der
the Revelation of the Gospel Doctrines, is not
so much a Mercy to be acknowledged as some
teach us, and it may in a negative Manner be true,
that the Christian Religion is an Efficient in the
Condemnation of Sinners, and loses more than it
saves, which is impious but to imagin: On the o∣ther
Hand, if all those Nations are concluded
under the Sentence of eternal Absence from God,
which is Hell in the Abstract; then what becomes
of all the sceptical Doctrines of its being incon∣sistent
with the Mercy and Goodness of an infi∣nite
and beneficent Being, to condemn so great a
Part of the World, for not believing in him of
whom they never had any Knowledge or Instru∣ction?
But I desire not to be the Promoter of un∣answerable
Doubts in Matters of Religion; much
less would I promote Cavils at the Foundations
of Religion, either as to its Profession or Practice,
and therefore I only name Things. I return to my
Enquiry after Religion as we generally understand
the Word.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="144"/>
And in this I confine my self in my present Enqui∣ries
to the particular Nations professing the Chri∣stian
Religion only, and I shall take Notice after∣ward,
what influence the want of Religion has
upon the Manners the Genius, and the Capaci∣ties
of the People, as to all the improvable Parts of
human Knowledge.</P>
<P>The <HI>Moors</HI> of <HI>Barbary</HI> are <HI>Mahometans,</HI> and that
of the most degenerate and unpolished Sort, espe∣cially
of that Part of the World where they live;
they are cruel as Beasts, vicious, insolent, and in∣human
as degenerated Nature can make them:
Moral Vertues have so little recommended them∣selves
to any among them, that they are accounted
no Accomplishment, and are in no Esteem; nor is
a Man at all respected for being grave, sober, ju∣dicious,
or wise, or for being just in his Dealings,
or most easy in his Conversation; but Rapine and
Injury is the Custom of the Place; and it is to re∣commend
a great Man, that he is rich, powerful
in Slaves, merciless in his Government of them,
and imperiously haughty in his whole Houshold.
Every Man is a King within himself, and regards
neither Justice or Mercy, Humanity or Civility,
either to them above him, or them below him,
but just as his arbitrary Passions guide him.</P>
<P>Religion here is confin'd to the <HI>Biram</HI> and the
<HI>Ramadan,</HI> the Feast and the Fast, to the Mosque
and the Bath; reading the Alcoran on one Hand,
and performing the Washings and Purifications on
the other, make up their religious Exercises; and
for the rest, Conversation is eaten up with Bar∣barisms
and Brutish Customs; so that there's nei∣ther
Society, Humanity, Confidence in one ano∣ther,
or Conversation with one another; but Men
live like the wild Beasts, for every Man here real∣ly
would destroy and devour the other if the could.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="145"/>
This guided me to a just Reflection▪ in Ho∣nour
of the Christian Religion, which I have of∣ten
since made Use of, and which on this Occa∣sion
I will make a Digressio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to, <HI>viz.</HI> That it is to
be said for the Reputation of the Christian Religi∣on
in general, and by which it is justly distin∣guish'd
from all other Religions, that where-ever
Christianity has been planted or profess'd natio∣nally
in the World, even where it has not had a
<HI>Saving</HI> Influence, it has yet had a <HI>Civilizing</HI> Influ∣ence:
It has operated upon the Manners, the Mo∣rals,
the Politics, and even the Tempers and
Dispositions of the People: It has reduc'd them to
the Practice of Virtue, and to the true Methods
of Living, has wean'd them from the <HI>Barbarous</HI>
Customs they had been used to, infusing a Kind
of Humanity and Softness of Disposition into their
very Natures; civilizing and softning them, teach∣ing
them to love a Regularity of <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fe,</HI> and filling
them with Principles of generous Kindness and
Beneficence one to another; in a Word, it has
taught them to live like Men, and act upon the
Foundations of Clemency, Humanity, Love, and
and good Neighbourhood, suitable to the Nature
and Dignity of God's Image, and to the Rules of
Justice and Equity, which it instructs them in.</P>
<P>Nay farther, I must observe also, That as the
Christian Religion has worn out, or been remo∣ved
from any Country, and they have returned to
Heathenism and Idolatry, so the Barbarisms have
return'd, the Customs of the Heathen Nations have
been again restor'd; the very Nature and Temper of
the People, have been again lost; all their generous
Principles have forsaken them, the Softness and
Goodness of their Dispositions have worn out,
and they have returned to Cruelty, Inhumanity,
Rapin, and Blood.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="146"/>
It is true, and it may be nam'd as an Obje∣ction
to this Remark of mine, that the <HI>Romans</HI>
tho' Heathens, and the <HI>Grecians</HI> by the Study of
Philosophy, in particular Persons, and by the
Excellency of their Government in their general
or national Capacity, were fill'd with Notions of
Virtue and Honour, with most generous and just
Principles, and acted with an heroic Mind in
many Occasions; practising the most sublime and
exa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed Height of Virtue, such as sacrificing their
Lives for their Country, with the utmost Zeal;
descending to great Examples of Humanity and
Beneficence, scorning to do base or vile Actions,
as unworthy the <HI>Roman</HI> Name, to save their
Lives; and a great many most excellent Examples
of Virtue and Gallantry, are found in the Histo∣ries
of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empires.</P>
<P>This does not oppose, it rather indeed illustrates
what I say; for with all the Philosophy, all the
Humanity and Gen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rosity they practis'd, they had
yet their Remains of Barbarity, were cruel and
unmerciful in their Natures, as appear'd by the
Barbarity of their Customs, such as throwing Ma∣lefactors
to wild Beasts, the Fightings of their
Gladiators, and the like; which were not only
appointed as Punishments and Severities, by the
Order of Public Justice; but to shew it touch'd the
very Article I am upon, it was the Subject of
their Sport and Diversion, these Things were ex∣hibited
as Shows to entertain the Ladies; the
Cutting in Pieces fourty or fifty Slaves, and the
Seeing twenty or thirty miserable Creatures thrown
to the Lyons and Tygers, was no less pleasant to
them, than the Going to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee an Opera, a Masque∣rade,
or a Puppet Show, is to us; So that I
think, the <HI>Romans</HI> were very far from a People ci∣viliz'd
and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h'd in their Natures by the Influ∣enc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
<PB N="131" REF="147"/>
of Religion. And this is evident, because,
that as the Christian Religion came among them,
all those cruel Customs were abhorr'd by them, the
famous Theatres and Circles for their publick
Sports, were overthrown, and the Ruines of
them testify the Justice of my Observation at this
very Day.</P>
<P>Nor will it be deny'd, if I should carry this yet
farther, and observe, That even among Christians▪
those who are more reform'd, and farther and far∣ther
christianiz'd, are still in Proportion rendred
more human, more soft and tender; and we do
find, without being partial to our selves, that even
the Protestant Countries are much distinguish'd in
the Humanity and Softness of their Tempers, the
meek merciful Disposition extends more among
Protestants, than among the Papists, as I could
very particularly demonstrate from History and
Experience.</P>
<P>But to return back to the Moores, where I left
off, they are an Instance of that Cruelty of Dispo∣sition,
which was anciently in their Nature, and
how in a Country abandon'd of the true Christian
Religion, after it has been first planted and pro∣fess'd
among them, the Return of Heathenism or
Mahometanism has brought back with it all the
Barbarisms of a Nation void of Religion and good
Nature.</P>
<P>I saw enough of these dreadful People to think
them at this Time the worst of all the Nations of
the World; a Nation, where no such thing as a
generous Spirit, or a Temper with any Compas∣sion
mixt with it, is to be found; among whom
Nature appears stripp'd of all the additional Glo∣ries,
which it derives from Religion, and yet where∣on
a Christian flourishing Church had stood several
hundred Years.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="148"/>
From these I went among the Negroes of <HI>Afri∣ca;</HI>
many of them I saw without any the least No∣tion
of a Deity among them, much less any Form
or Worship; but I had not any Occasion to con∣verse
with them on Shore▪ other than I have done
since by Accident, but went away to the <HI>Brasils:</HI>
Here I found the Natives, and that even before the
<HI>Portuguese</HI> came among them, and since also, had
Abundance of Religion, <HI>such as it was:</HI> But it
was all so bloody, so cruel; consisting of Murders,
human Sacrifices, Witchcrafts, Sor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eries, and Con∣jurings,
that I could not so much as call them ho∣nest
Pagans, as I do the Negroes.</P>
<P>As for the Cannibals, as I have observ'd in the
Discourse of them, on Account of their Landing
on my Island, I can say but very little of them:
As for their eating human Flesh, I take it to be a
Kind of martial Rage, rather than a civil Pra∣ctice;
for 'tis evident, they eat no human Crea∣tures,
but such as are taken Prisoners in their Bat∣tles;
and as I have observ'd in giving the Account
of those things, they do not Esteem it Murder, no
nor so much as unlawful. I must confess, saving
its being a Practice in itself unnatural, especially
to us, I say, saving that Part, I see little Difference
between that and our Way, which in the War is
frequent in Heat of Action, <HI>viz.</HI> refusing Quarter;
for as to the Difference between Eating and Kil∣ling
those that offer to yield, it matters not much.
And this I observed at the same Time, that in
their other Conduct, those Savages were as human,
as mild, and gentle, as most I have met with in
the World, and as easily civiliz'd.</P>
<P>From these Sorts of People, I come to the <HI>Indi∣ans;</HI>
for as to the <HI>Madagascar</HI> Men, I saw very
little of them, but that they were a Kind of Ne∣gr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es,
much like those on the Coast of <HI>Guinea,</HI> on∣ly,
<PB N="133" REF="149"/>
a little more used and accustomed to the <HI>Euro∣peans,</HI>
by their often Landing among them.</P>
<P>The <HI>E. Indians</HI> are generally Pagans or Mahome∣tans,
and have such Mixtures of Savage Customs
with them, that even Mahometanism is there in
its Corruption; neither have they there, the up∣right
just Dealing in Matters of Right and Wrong,
which the <HI>Turks</HI> in <HI>Europe</HI> have, with whom 'tis
generally very safe trading: But here they act all
the Parts of Thieves and Cheats, watching to de∣ceive
you, and proud of being thought able to
do it.</P>
<P>The Subjects of the great <HI>Mogul</HI> have a seeming
polite Government; and the Inhabitants of <HI>Cey∣lon</HI>
are under very strict Discipline; and yet what
Difficulty do we find to trade with them? Nay,
their very Oeconomy renders them fraudulent,
and in some places they cannot turn their
Thoughts to being honest.</P>
<P><HI>China</HI> is famous for Wisdom, <HI>that is to say,</HI> that
they, having such a boundless Conceit of their own
Wisdom, we are oblig'd to allow them more than
they have; the Truth is, they are justly said to be
a wise Nation among the foolish ones, and may
as justly be called a Nation of Fools among the
wise ones.</P>
<P>As to their Religion, 'tis all summ'd up in <HI>Con∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cius</HI>
his Maxims, whose Theology, I take to
be a Rhapsody of Moral Conclusions; a Founda∣tion,
or what we may call Elements of Polity,
Morality and Superstition, huddl'd together in a
Rhapsody of Words, without Consistency, and
indeed with very little Reasoning in it: Then 'tis
really not so much as a refin'd Paganism, for
there are in my Opinion much more regular Do∣ings
among some of the <HI>Indians</HI> that are Pagans in
<HI>America,</HI> than there are in <HI>China:</HI> And if I may be∣lieve
<PB N="134" REF="150"/>
the Account given of the Government of
<HI>Montezuma</HI> in <HI>Mexico,</HI> and of the Unca's of <HI>Cusco</HI>
in <HI>Peru;</HI> their Worship and Religion such as it
was, was carry'd on with more Regularity than
these in <HI>China.</HI> As to the human Ingenuity, as they
call it, of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> I shall account for it by itself:
The utmost Discoveries of it to me appear'd in the
Mechanicks, and even in them infinitely short of
of what is found among the <HI>European</HI> Nations.</P>
<P>But let us take these People to Pieces a little,
and examine into the great Penetration, they are
so fam'd for: First of all, their Knowledge has
not led them that Length in religio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Matters,
which the common Notions of Philosophy would
have done, and to which they did lead the wise Hea∣thens
of Old among the <HI>Grecian</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Em∣pires;
for they having not the Knowledge of the
true God, preserv'd notwithstanding, the Notion
of a God to be something Immortal, Omnipo∣tent,
sublime; exalted above in Place, as well as
Authority; and therefore made Heaven to be
the Seat of their Gods, and the Images by
which they represented the Gods and Goddesses,
had always some Perfections that were really to be
admir'd; as the Attendants of their Gods, as
<HI>Jupiter</HI> was call'd the Thunderer, for his Power;
Father of Gods and Men, for his Seniority; <HI>Ve∣nus</HI>
ador'd for her Beauty; <HI>Mercury</HI> for Swiftness;
<HI>Apollo</HI> for Wit, Poetry, Musick; <HI>Mars</HI> for Terror
and Gallantry in Arms, and the like: But when
we come to these polite Nations of <HI>China,</HI> which
yet we cry up for Sense, and Greatness of Genius,
we see them groveling in the very Sink and Filth
of Idolatry; their Idols are the most frightful mon∣strous
Shapes, not the Form of any real Creature,
much less the Images of Virtue, of Chastity, of Li∣terature;
but horrid Shapes of their Priests Inven∣tion;

speak, but meerly to instill horrible Ideas of some∣thing
nauseous and abominable, into the Minds
of Men that ador'd them.</P>
<P>If I may be allow'd to give my Notio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of Wor∣ship,
I mean, as it relates to the Objects of natu∣ral
Homage, where the Name and Nature of God
is not reveal'd, as in the Christian Religion. I must
acknowledge, the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, the
Elements, as in the Pagan and Heathen Nations
of old; and above all these, the Representations of
superiour Virtues and Excellencies among
Men, such as Valour, Fortitude, Chastity, Pa∣tience,
Beauty, Strength, Love, Learning, Wis∣dom,
and the like; The Objects of Worship in
the <HI>Grecian</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Times, were far more eligi∣ble,
and more rational Objects of divine Rites, than
the Idols of <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japan;</HI> where with all the
Oeconomy of their State Maxims and Rules of
Civil Government, which we insist so much on,
as Tests of their Wisdom, their great Capacities,
and Understandings; their Worship is the most
brutish, and the Objects of their Worship, the
coursest, the most unmanly, inconsistent with Rea∣son
or the Nature of Religion of any the World
can shew; bowing down to a meer Hob-gobblin,
and doing their Reverence not to the Work of
Mens Hands only, but the ugliest, basest, fright∣fullest
things that Man could make; Images so
far from being lovely and amiable, as in the Na∣ture
of Worship is implied, that they are the most
detestable and nauseous, even to Nature.</P>
<P>How is it possible these People can have any
Claim to the Character of wise, ingenious, polite,
<PB N="136" REF="152"/>
that could suffer themselves to be overwhelm'd in
an Idolatry repugnant to common Sense, even to
Nature, and be brought to chuse to adore that
which was in itself the most odious and con∣temptible
to Nature; not meerly terrible, that so
their Worship might proceed from Fear, but a
Complication of Nature's Aversions.</P>
<P>I cannot omit, that being in one of their Tem∣ples,
or rather in a kind of Oratory or Chapel,
annexed to one Part or the great Palace at <HI>Peguin,</HI>
there appear'd a Mandarin with his Attendants,
or, as we may say, a great Lord and his Retinue,
prostrate before the Image, not of any one of God's
Creatures, but a Creature of meer human Forming,
such as neither was alive, nor was like any thing
that had Life, or had ever been seen or heard of
in the World.</P>
<P>The like Image, or something worse, if
I could give it a true Representation, may be
found in a Garden Chapel, if not defac'd by wi∣ser
Heads, of a great <HI>Tartarian</HI> Mandarin, at a
small Distance from <HI>Nanquin,</HI> and to which the
poor abandon'd Creatures, pay their most blinded
Devotions.</P>
<P>It had a thing instead of a Head, but no Head;
it had a Mouth distorted out of all Manner of
Shape, and not to be deser<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bed for a Mouth, being
only an uns<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>apen Chasm, neither representing the
Mouth of a Man, Beast, Fowl, or Fish: The
Thing was neither any of the four, but an incon∣gruous
Monster: It had Feet, Hands, Fingers,
Claws, Legs, Arms, Wings, Ears, Horns, every
Thing mixt one among another, neither in the
Shape or Place that Nature appointed, but blend∣ed
together, and fix'd to a Bulk, not a Body;
form'd of no just Parts, but a shapeless Trunk or
Log; whether of Wood or Stone, I know not;
<PB N="137" REF="153"/>
a thing that might have stood with any Side for∣ward,
or any Side backward, any End upward,
or any End downward, that had as much Vene∣ration
due to it on one Side, as on the other, a
kind of celestial Hedge-hog, that was rolled up
within itself, and was every thing every Way; that
to a Christian could not have been worthy to have
represented even the Devil; and to Men of common
Sense, must have been their very Souls Aversion▪
In a Word, if I have not represented their mon∣strous
Deities right, let Imagination supply any∣thing
that can make a misshapen Image horrid,
frightful, and surprising; And you may with Ju∣stice
suppose, those sagacious People, called the
<HI>Chineses,</HI> whom forsooth we must admire, I say,
you may suppose them prostrate on the Ground,
with all their Pomp and Pageanty, which is in it
self not a little, worshipping such a mangled, pro∣miscuous
gendred Creature.</P>
<P>Shall we call these a wise Nation, who repre∣sent
God in such hideous monstrous Figures as
these, and can prostrate themselves to things ten
thousand Times more disfigured than the Devil?
Had these Images been contriv'd in the <HI>Romans</HI>
Time, and been set up for the God of Ugliness,
as they had their God of Beauty, they might in∣deed
have been thought exquisite; but the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI>
would have spurn'd such an Image out of their
Temples.</P>
<P>Nothing can render a Nation so compleatly
foolish and simple, as such an Extravagance in
Matters of religious Worship; for if gross Igno∣rance
in the Notion of a God, which is so ex∣tremely
natural, will not demonstrate a Nation
unpolish'd, foolish, and weak, even next to Ideo∣tism,
I know nothing that will.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="154"/>
But let me trace this wise Nation that we talk
so much of, and who not only think themselves
wise, but have drawn us in, to pay a Kind of Ho∣mage
to their low-priz'd Wit.</P>
<P>Government, and the Mechanick Arts, are the
two main things in which our People in <HI>England,</HI>
who have admir'd them so much, pretend they
excel; as to their Government, which consists in
an absolute Tyranny, which, by the Way, is the
easiest Way of Ruling in the World, where the
People are dispos'd to obey, as blindly as the
<HI>Mandarin</HI> commands or governs imperiously;
what Policy is required in governing a Peo∣ple,
of whom 'tis said, that if you command them to
hang themselves, they will only cry a little, and sub∣mit
immediately? Their Maxims of Government
may do well enough among themselves, but with
us they would be all Confusion. In their Country
it is not so, only because, whatever the <HI>Man∣darin</HI>
says, is a Law, and God himself has no
Power or Interest among them to contradict it,
unless he pleases to execute it <HI>brevi manu</HI> from
Heaven.</P>
<P>Most of their Laws consist in immediate Judg∣ment,
swift Executions, just Re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aliations, and
fair Protection from Injuries: Their Punishments
are cruel and exorbitant, such as Cutting the Hands
and the Feet off for Theft, at the same Time re∣leasing
Murders and other flagrant Crimes.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Mandarines</HI> are their Judges in very many
Cases, like our Justices of the Peace; but then
they judge by Customs, Oral Tradition, or im∣mediate
Opinion, and execute the Sentence im∣mediately,
without room, or Time to reflect
upon the Justice of it, or to consider of Mitigations,
as in all Christian Countries is practised, and as
the Sense of human Frailty would direct.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="155"/>
But let me come to their Mechanics, in which
their Ingenuity is so much cry'd up, I affirm there is
little or nothing sufficient to build the mighty Opi∣nion
we have of them upon, but what is founded up∣on
the Comparisons which we make between them
and other Pagan Nations, or proceeds from the
Wonder which we make, that they should have
any Knowledge of Mechanics Arts, because we
find the remote Inhabitants of <HI>Afric</HI> and <HI>America,</HI>
so grossly ignorant, and so entirely destitute in such
things; whereas we do not consider, that the <HI>Chi∣neses</HI>
inhabit the Continent of <HI>Asia;</HI> and tho' they
are separated by Desarts and Wildernesses, yet
they are a continuous Continent of Land, with
the Parts of the World once inhabited by the poli∣ter
<HI>Medes, Persians,</HI> and <HI>Grecians;</HI> that the first
Ideas of Mechanic Arts were probably receiv'd
by them from the <HI>Persians, Assyrians,</HI> and the ba∣nish'd
transplanted <HI>Israelites,</HI> who are said to be
carry'd into the Regions of <HI>Parthia,</HI> and the Bor∣ders
of <HI>Karacathay,</HI> from whence they are also said
to have communicated Arts, and especially Han∣dicraft,
in which the <HI>Israelites</HI> excell'd, to the In∣habitants
of all those Countries, and consequently
in Time to those beyond them.</P>
<P>But let them be received from whom they will,
and how long ago soever; let us but compare the
Improvement they have made, with what others
have made; and except in things peculiar to them∣selves
by their Climate, we shall find the utmost
of their Ingenuity amounts but to a very Tri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le, and
that they are out-done even in the best of their
Works by our ordinary Artists, whose Imitations
exceed their Originals, beyond all Comparison.</P>
<P>For Example, they have Gun-powder and Guns,
whether they have learned to make them by Di∣rection
of <HI>Europeans,</HI> which is most likely, or that
<PB N="140" REF="156"/>
they found it out by meer Strength of Invention,
as some would advance, tho' without Certainty,
in their Favour: Be it which it will, as I say,
it matters not much; their Powder is of no
Strength for the needful Operations of Sieges,
Mines, Batteries, no nor for shooting of Birds, as
ours is, without great Quantities put together;
their Guns are rather an Ostentation than for Exe∣cution,
clumsy, heavy, and ill made; neither have
they arriv'd to any tolerable Degree of Know∣ledge
in the Art of Gunnery or Engineering; they
have no Bombs, Carcasses, Hand-grenades; their
artificial Fireworks are in no Degree comparable,
or to be nam'd with ours; nor have they arriv'd to
any thing in the military Skill, in martialling Ar∣mies,
handling Arms, Discipline, and the Exer∣cise
in the Field, as the <HI>Europeans</HI> have; all
which is depending on the Improvement of Fire-Arms,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> in which, if they have had the Use of
Gun-powder so many Ages as some Dream, they
must be unaccountable Blockheads, that they have
made no farther Improvement; and if it is but
lately, they are yet apparently dull enough in the
managing of it, at least, compar'd to what ought
to be expected of an ingenious People, such as our
People cry them up to be.</P>
<P>I might go from this to their Navigation, in
which it is true they out-do most of their Neigh∣bours:
But what is all their Skill in Sailing com∣par'd
to ours? Whither do they go? And how
manage the little and foolish Barks and Jonks they
have? What would they do with them to traverse
the great <HI>Indian, American,</HI> or <HI>Atlantic</HI> Oceans?
What Ships, what Sailors, what poor, awkard,
and ignorant Doings is there among them at Sea?
And when our People hire any of them, as some∣times
they are oblig'd to do, How do our Sailors
<PB N="141" REF="157"/>
kick them about, as a Parcel of clumsy, ignorant▪
unhandy Fellows?</P>
<P>Then for building of Ships, What are they?
And what are they able to do towards the glo∣rious
Art of building a large Man of War? 'Tis
out of Doubt with me, that all the People of
<HI>China</HI> could not build such a Ship as the <HI>Royal So∣vereign,</HI>
in a hundred Years, no not tho' she
was there for them to look at, and take Pattern
by.</P>
<P>I might go on to abundance more things, such
as Painting, making Glasses, making Clocks and
Watches, making Bone-lace, Frame-work Knit∣ting;
of all which, except the two first, they know
little or nothing; and of the two first, nothing
compar'd to what is done in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The Height of their Ingenuity, and for which
we admire them with more Colour of Cause than
in other things, is their Porcella<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n or Earthen∣ware
Work, which, in a Word, is more due to
the excellent Composition of the Earth they make
them of, and which is their Peculiar, than to
the Workmanship, in which, if we had the same
Clay, we should soon outdo them, as much as we
do in other things. The next Art is, their Ma∣nufacturing
in fine Silks, Cotton, Herba, Gold,
and Silver, in which they have nothing but what
is in common with our ordinary poor Weavers.</P>
<P>The next Mechanic Art is, their Lacquering,
which is just as in the <HI>China</HI> Ware, a Peculiar to
their Country, in the Materials, not at all in the
Workmanship: And as for the Cabinet Work of
it, they are manifestly out-done by us; and abun∣dance

I might run the like Parallel thro' most of the
things these People excel in, which would all ap∣pear
to be so deficient,, as would render all their
fam'd Wisdom and Capacity most scandalously
imperfect: But I am not so<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>much upon their Cun∣ning
in Arts, as upon their Absurdity and ridicu∣lous
Folly in Matters religious, and in which I
think the rudest <HI>Barbarians</HI> out-do them.</P>
<P>From this wise Nation, we have a vast Extent
of Ground, near 2000 Miles in Breadth; partly
under the <HI>Chinese</HI> Government, partly under the
<HI>Muscovite,</HI> but inhabited by <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Mongul Tar∣tary,
Karkathay, Siberian,</HI> and <HI>Samoides</HI> Pagans;
whose Idols are almost as hideous as the <HI>Chineses,</HI>
and whose Religion is all Nature; and not only so,
but Nature under the greatest Degeneracy, and
next to Brutal. <HI>Father La Comte</HI> gives us the Pi∣ctures
or some of their House Idols, and an Ac∣count
of their Worship; and this lasts, as I have
observ'd, to within a few Days of <HI>Arch-Angel▪</HI>
So that, in a Word, from the Mouth of the <HI>Straits,</HI>
that is to say, from <HI>Sallee</HI> over to <HI>Caribbea,</HI> from
thence round <HI>Africa</HI> by the Cape of good Hope,
cross the vast <HI>Indian</HI> Ocean, and upon all the
Coast of it, about by <HI>Malacca</HI> and <HI>Sumatra,</HI> thro'
the Straits of <HI>Sincapore</HI> and the Coast of <HI>Siam</HI> North∣wards
to <HI>China,</HI> and thro' <HI>China</HI> by Land over the
Desarts of the Grand <HI>Tartary,</HI> to the River <HI>Dwi∣na,</HI>
being a Circuit three Times the Diameter of
the Earth, and every jot as far as the whole Cir∣cumference.
The Name of God is not heard of,
except among a few of the <HI>Indians</HI> that are Ma∣hometan;
the Word of God is not known, or
the Son of God spoken of.</P>
<P>Having some Warmth in my Search after Re∣ligion,
occasion'd by this Reflection, and so little
o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it appearing in all the Parts which I had tra∣vel'd,
<PB N="143" REF="159"/>
I resolv'd to travel over the rest of the
World in Books, for my wandring Days are pretty
well over; I say, I resolv'd to travel the rest in
Books; and sure, said I, there must appear abun∣dance
of serious Religion in the rest of the World,
or else I know nothing at all of where I shall find
it.</P>
<P>But I find by my Reading, just as I did in Tra∣velling,
that all the Customs of Nations, as to
Religion, were much alike; that one with ano∣ther,
they are more devout in their Worship of
something, <HI>whatever it be,</HI> than inquisitive after
what it is they worship; and most of the Altars
of Worship in the World, might to this Day be
inscrib'd to the Unknown God.</P>
<P>This may seem a strange thing; but that Won∣der
may cease, when farther Enquiry is made into
the particular Objects of Worship, which the se∣veral
Nations of the World bow down to, some of
which, are so horrid, so absurd, as one would
think human Nature could not sink so low, as to do
her Homage in so irrational a Manner.</P>
<P>And here, being to speak of Religion as idola∣trous,
it occurs to me, that it seem'd strange, that
except in <HI>Persia,</HI> and some Part of <HI>Tartary,</HI> I found
none of the People look <HI>Up</HI> for their Gods, but
<HI>Down;</HI> by which it came into my Mind, that even
in Idolatry itself, the World was something dege∣nerated,
and their Reason was more hoodwink'd
than their Ancestors.</P>
<P>By looking up, and looking down, I mean, they
do not as the <HI>Romans,</HI> look up among the Stars
for their Idols, place their Gods in the Skies, and
worship, as we might say, like Men; but look
down among the Brutes, form Idols to them∣selves
out of the Beasts, and figure things like
<PB N="144" REF="160"/>
Monsters, to adore them for their Ugliness and
horrible Deformity.</P>
<P>Of the Two, the former, in my Opinion, was
much the more rational Idolatry, as particularly▪
the <HI>Persians</HI> worshipping the Sun; and when I had
a particular Account of that at <HI>Bengale,</HI> it present∣ly
occur'd to my Thought, that there was some∣thing
awful, something glorious▪ and: <HI>God-like</HI> in
the Sun, that, in the Ignorance of the True God,
might rationally bespeak the Homage of the Crea∣tures;
and to whom it seem'd reasonable▪ <HI>where
Reason was its own Judge only, without the Helps of
Revelation,</HI> to pay an Adoration; as the Parent of
Light, and the Giver of Life to all the Vegetative
World, and as in a visible Manner, enlivening and
influencing the rational and sensitive Life, and
which might, for ought they knew, at first create,
as it did since, so plainly affect all things round
us.</P>
<P>This Thought gave Birth to the following Ex∣cursion,
with which I shall close this Observa∣tion.</P>
<LG>
<L>Hail! Glorious Lamp, the Parent of the Day,</L>
<L>Whose Beams net only Heat, and Life convey;</L>
<L>But may that Heat and Life, for ought we know,</L>
<L>On many many distant Worlds bestow.</L>

<L>Thy Cent'ral Vigour never never dies▪</L>
<L>But Life the Motion, Motion, Life supplies▪</L>

When lesser Bodies rob us of thy Beams,</L>
<L>And intercept thy flowing heavenly Streams;</L>
<L>Fools by Mistake ecclipse thee from their Sight,</L>
<L>When 'tis the Eye's ecclips'd, and not thy Light.</L>
<L>Thy Absence constitutes effectual Night,</L>
<L>When rolling Earth deprives us of thy Light:</L>
<L>And Planets all opaque and beggerly,</L>
<L>Borrow thy Beams, and strive to shine like thee.</L>
<L>In their mock life-less Light we starve and freeze,</L>
<L>And wait the Warmth of thy returning Rays.</L>
<L>Thy Distance leaves us all recline and sad,</L>
<L>And hoary Winter governs in thy Stead:</L>

<L>Great Soul of Nature, from whose vital Spring</L>
<L>Due Heat and Life's diffus'd, thro' every thing:</L>

<L>How imperceptible thy Influence</L>
<L>Slides thro' their Veins, and touches every Sense;</L>
<L>By glimmering Nature led, they bow their Knee,</L>
<L>Mistake their God, and sacrifice to thee.</L>
<L>Mourn thy declining Steps, and hate the Night,</L>
<L>But when in Hope of thy approaching Light,</L>
<L>Bless thy Return, which brings the chearful Day,</L>
<L>And to thy wond'rous Light false Adorations pay.</L>
<L><PB N="146" REF="162"/>
Nor can we blame the Justice of the Thought,</L>
<L>In Minds by erring Reason only, taught.</L>
<L>Nature it seems instructs a Deity,</L>
<L>And Reason says, there's none so bright as thee.</L>
<L>Nor is the Influence so much a Jest,</L>
<L>There's something shocks our Nature in the Rest:</L>
<L>To make a God, and then the Tool adore,</L>
<L>And bow to that, that worshipp'd us before.</L>
<L>The Nonsense takes off all the Reverence,</L>
<L>That can't be worshipping that is not Sense.</L>
<L>But when the Spring of Nature shews its Face,</L>
<L>The Glory of its Rays, the Swiftness of its Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</L>
<L>Stupendous Height, and Majesty Divine,</L>
<L>And with what awful Splendor it can shine:</L>
<L>Who that no other News from Heaven could hear,</L>
<L>Would think but this was God, would think and fear,</L>
<L>No other Idol ever came so near.</L>
</LG>
<P>Certain it is, that the <HI>Persians</HI> who thus paid
their Adoration to the Sun, were at that Time
some of the wisest People in the World. Some
tell us, that the great Image that <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI>
set up for all his People to worship, was repre∣sented
holding the Sun in his Right-hand; and
that it was to the Representation of the Sun that
he commanded all Nations and Kindreds to bow
and to worship: If so, then the <HI>Assyrians</HI> were Wor∣shippers
also of the Sun, as well as the <HI>Persians,</HI>
which is not at all improbable; we read also in
the Scripture, of those Nations who worshipped
all the Host of Heaven, a Thing much more ra∣tional,
and nearer of Kin to Worshipping the
Great God of Heaven, than worshipping the
<PB N="147" REF="163"/>
whole Host of the Earth, and worshipping the
most abject and loathsome Creatures, or but even
the Representations of those Creatures, which was
still worse than the other.</P>
<P>But what are all the Absurdities of Heathenism,
which at last are resolv'd into the Degeneracy of
Mankind, and their being fallen from the Knowledge
of the true God, which was once, as we have
Reason to believe, diffused to all Mankind.</P>
<P>I say, What are these? And how much Ground
for just Reflection do they afford us, compar'd
to the gross things in Practice, which we find
every Day among those Nations, who profess to
have had the clear Light of Gospel Revelation?</P>
<P>How many Self-contradicting Principles do they
hold? How contrary to their Profession do they act?
How do one Side burn for what another Side ab∣hors?
And how do Christians, <HI>taking that vene∣rable
Name for a general Appellation,</HI> doom one ano∣ther
to the Devil, for a few disagreeing Clauses
of the same Religion, while all profess to worship
the same Deity, and to expect the same Salva∣tion?</P>
<P>With what preposterous Enthusiasms do some
mingle their Knowledge, and with as gross Ab∣surdities
others their Devotion? How blindly su∣perstitious?
How furious and raging in their
Zeal? How cruel, inexorable, and even inhuman
and barbarous to one another, when they differ?
as if Religion divested us of Humanity, and that
in our worshipping a God of Mercy, and in
whose Compassions alone it is that we have room
to hope, we should to please and serve him, ba∣nish
Humanity from our Nature, and shew no
Compassion to those that fall into our Hands.</P>
<P>In my Travelling thro' <HI>Portugal,</HI> it was my Lot to
come to <HI>Lisbon,</HI> while they held there one of their
<PB N="148" REF="164"/>
Courts of Justice, call'd <HI>Auto de fe,</HI> that is to say
a Court of Justice of the Inquisition: It is a Sub∣ject
has been handled by many Writers, and indeed
expos'd by some of the best Catholicks; and my
present Business is not to write a History, or en∣gage
in a Dispute, but to relate a Passage.</P>
<P>They carry'd in Procession all their Criminals
to the great Church; where eight of them ap∣pear'd
first, dress'd up in Gowns and Caps of Can∣vass,
upon which was painted all that Man could
devise, of Hell's Torments, Devils broiling and
roasting human Bodies, and a thousand such fright∣ful
things, with Flames and Devils besides in eve∣ry
Part of the Dress.</P>
<P>Those I found were eight poor Creatures con∣demn'd
to be burnt, and for they scarce knew what;
but for Crimes against the Catholick Faith, and
against the Blessed Virgin, and they were burnt.
One of them, it was said, rejoic'd that he was to
be burnt; and being ask'd, Why? Answer'd, That
he had much rather die, than be carry'd back to
the Prison of the Inquisition, where their Cruel∣ties
were worse than Death: Of those eight, as I
was told, some were Jews, whose greatest Crime,
as many there did not scruple to say, was, that
they were very rich; and some Christians were in
the Number at the same Time, whose greatest
Misery was, that they were very poor.</P>
<P>It was a Sight that almost gave me a Shock in
my N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion of Christianity itself, till I began to re∣collect,
that it might be possible, that Inquisitors
were scarce Christians, and that <HI>I knew</HI> many Ca∣tholic
Countries do not suffer this abominable Judi∣cature
to be erected among them.</P>
<P>I have seen much, and read more, of the unhap∣py
Conduct in Matters or Religion, among the
other Nations of the World, professing the Chri∣stian
<PB N="149" REF="165"/>
Religion; and upon my Word, I find some
Practices infinitely scandalous, some which are the
common receiv'd Customs of Christians, which
would be the Abhorrence of Heathens; and it re∣quires
a strong Attachment to the Foundation,
which is indeed the principal Part in Religion, to
guard our Minds against being offended, even at
the Christian Religion itself; but I got over that
Part afterward.</P>
<P>Let it not offend the Ears of any true Lover of
the Christian Religion, that I observe some of the
Follies of the Professors of the Christian Religion,
assuring you, 'tis far from being my Design to bring
the least Scandal upon the Profession itself.</P>
<P>And here therefore let me give the Words of
a judicious Person who travell'd from <HI>Turkey</HI> thro'
<HI>Italy:</HI> His Words are these.</P>
<P>“When I was in <HI>Italy,</HI> I rang'd over great Part
of the Patrimony of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> where one would
think indeed, the Face of Religion would be
plainest to be seen, and without any Disguise;
but in short I found there the Face of Reli∣gion,
and no more.”</P>
<P>“At <HI>Rome</HI> there was all the Pomp and Glory
of religious Habits: The Pope and the Cardi∣nals
walk'd with a religious Gravity, but liv'd
in a religious Luxury, kept up the Pomp of Re∣ligion,
and the Dignity of religious Titles:
But like our Lord's Observation on the <HI>Phari∣sees,</HI>
I found within they were all ravening
Wolves.”</P>
<P>“The religious Justice they do there, is par∣cularly
remarkable, and very much recommends
them. The Church protects Murthers and As∣sassins,
and then delivers the Civil Magistrates
over to Satan, for doing Justice. They inter∣dict
whole Kingdoms, and shut up the Churches
<PB N="150" REF="166"/>
for Want of paying a few Ecclesiastic Dues,
and so put a Stop to Religion for Want of their
Money. I found the <HI>Courtezans</HI> were the most
constant Creatures at the Church, and the most
certain Place for an Assignation with another
Man's Wife, was at Prayers.”</P>
<P>“The Court of Inquisition burnt two Men for
speaking dishonourably of the Blessed Virgin,
and the Missionaries in <HI>China</HI> tolerated the Wor∣shipping
the Devil by their new Convert. A
Jew was likewise burnt for denying Christ, while
the Jesuits join'd the Paganism of the Heathen
with the High Mass, and sung Anthems to
the immortal Idols of <HI>Tonquin.</HI>”</P>
<P>“When I saw this, I resolv'd to enquire no more
after <HI>Religion</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> till by Accident meeting
with a Quietist, he gave me to understand, that
all Religion was internal, that the Duties of
Christianity were summ'd up in Reflection
and Ejaculation, He inveigh'd bitterly against
the Game of Religion, which he said was
playing over the whole World by the Clergy;
and said, <HI>Italy</HI> was a Theatre, where Religion
was the Grand <HI>Opera,</HI> and the Popish Clergy
were the Stage Players. I lik'd him in many
of his Notions about other Peoples Religion;
but when I came to talk with him a little close∣ly
about <HI>his own,</HI> it was so wrapp'd up in his
Internals, conceal'd in the Cavities and dark
Parts of the Soul, <HI>viz.</HI> Meditation without
Worship, Doctrine without Practice, Reflecti∣on
without Reformation, and Zeal with∣out
Knowledge; that I could come to no
Certainty with him, but in this, that Religion
in <HI>Italy</HI> was really <HI>invisible.</HI>”</P>
<P>This was very agreeable to my Notions of <HI>Ita∣lian</HI>
Religion, and to what I had met with from
<PB N="151" REF="167"/>
other People that had travel'd the Country: But
one Observation of Blindness and Superstition I
must give within my own Knowledge, and nearer
Home; when passing thro' <HI>Flanders,</HI> I found the
People in a certain City there, in a very
great Commotion: The Case was this; A certain
<HI>Scelerate,</HI> so they call an abandon'd Wretch given
up to all Wickedness, had broken into a Chapel
in the City, and had stoln the Pix or Casket where∣in
the sacred Host was deposited; which Host, af∣ter
rightly consecrated, they believe to be the real
Body of our Blessed Saviour, being transubstantiat∣ed,
as they call it, from the Substance of Bread.</P>
<P>The Fact being discover'd, the City, as I said
above, was all up in a Tumult; the Gates were
shut up, no Body suffer'd to go out; every House
was searched, and the utmost Diligence used; and
at length, as it was next to Impossibility he should
escape, he was discover'd.</P>
<P>His Execution was not long deferr'd: But first
he was examin'd, and I think by Torture, What
he had done with the sacred thing which was in
the Pix, which he had stoln? And at length he
confess'd, That he had thrown it into a House
of Office; and was carry'd with a Guard to shew
them the Place.</P>
<P>As it was impossible to find a little Piece of a
Wafer in such a Place, tho' no Pains was spar'd in
a most filthy Manner to search for it; but, as I say,
it could not be found, immediately the Place was
judg'd consecrated <HI>ipso facto,</HI> turn'd into an Orato∣ry,
and the devout People flock'd to it, to expiate
by their Prayers, the Dishonour done to the Lord
God, by throwing his precious Body into so vile a
Place. It was determin'd by the Wiser part, that the
Body would not fall down into the Place, but be
snatch'd up by its inherent Power, or by the holy
<PB N="152" REF="168"/>
Angels, and not be suffer'd to touch the Excre∣ments
in that Place. However, the People conti∣nu'd
their Devotions for some Time, just in the
Place where it was, and afterwards a large Cha∣pel
was built upon it, where the same Prayers are
continued, as I suppose, to this Day.</P>
<P>I had a particular Occasion to come at a very
accurate Account of <HI>Poland,</HI> by a <HI>Polish</HI> Gentle∣man,
in whose Company I travell'd, and from
whom I learn'd all that was worth enquiring of,
about religious Affairs in <HI>Prussia</HI> on one Side, and
<HI>Muscovy</HI> on the other.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Poland,</HI> he told me they were all Confu∣sion,
both in Church and in State; that notwith∣standing
their Wars, they were Persecutors of the
worst Kind; that they let the Jews live among 'em
undisturb'd, to such a Degree, that in the Coun∣try
about <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mberg</HI> and <HI>Kiow,</HI> there were reckon'd
above 30000 Jews: That these had not Tolera∣tion
only, but many Privileges granted them, tho'
they deny'd Christ to be the Messiah, or that the
Messiah was come in the Flesh; and blasphemed
his Name upon frequent Occasions; and at the
same Time they persecuted the Protestants, and
destroy'd their Churches, where-ever they had
Power to do it.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, when I came to enquire of
those Protestants, and what Kind of People they
were, who suffer'd so severely for their Religion, I
found they were generally a Sort of Protestants,
call'd <HI>Socinians,</HI> and that <HI>Lelius Socinus</HI> had spread
his Errors so universally over this Country, that our
Lord Jesus Christ was reduc'd here to little more
than a good Man sent from Heaven to instruct the
World, and far from capable of effecting by the In∣fluence
of his Spirit, and Grace, the glorious
Work of redeeming the World; As for the
<PB N="153" REF="169"/>
Divinity of the Holy Ghost, they have no Trou∣ble
about it.</P>
<P>Having given this Account of Knowledge
and Piety in the Countries inhabited by Christians
of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, it seems natural to say some
thing of the <HI>Greek</HI> Church.</P>
<P>There are in the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy</HI>'s Dominions
abundance of Wooden Churches; and had not
the Country been as full of Wooden Priests,
something might have been said for the Reli∣gion
of the <HI>Muscovites;</HI> for the People are won∣derfully
devout there, which would have been ve∣ry
well, if it had not been attended with the pro∣foundest
Ignorance that was ever heard of in any
Country, where the Name of Christian was so
much as talk'd of.</P>
<P>But when I came to enquire about their Wor∣ship,
I found our Lord Jesus Christ made so much
a meaner Figure among them than St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI>
that I concluded Religion was swallow'd up of
Superstition; and so indeed I found it was upon all
Occasions; as to the Conduct of the People in re∣ligious
Matters, their Ignorance is so establish'd
upon Obstinacy, <HI>which is the</HI> Muscovite'<HI>s national
Sin,</HI> that it would be really to no Purpose to look
any longer for a Reformation among them.</P>
<P>In short, no Man will, I believe, say of me,
that I do the <HI>Muscovites</HI> any Wrong, when I say
they are the most ignorant, and most obstinate
People in the Christian World, when I tell the
following Story of them.</P>
<P>It was after the Battle at <HI>Narva,</HI> where the
late King of <HI>Sweden Charles</HI> XII. defeated their great
Army, and after the Victory, extended his Troops
pretty far into their Country, and perhaps plun∣der'd
them a little, as he advanc'd; when the
<HI>Muscovites,</HI> we may be sure, being in the utmost
<PB N="154" REF="170"/>
Distress and Confusion, fell to their Prayers. We
read of nothing they had to say to God Almigh∣ty
in that Case; but to their Patron Saint they
address'd this extraordinary Prayer.</P>
<P>O Thou our perpetual Comforter in all our Adversi∣ties!
Thou infinitely Powerful St. <HI>NICHOLAS,</HI>
by what Sin, and how have we highly offended thee in
our Sacrifices, Genuflections, Reverences and Actions
of Thansgiving, that thou hast thus forsaken us? we
had therefore sought to appease thee entirely, and we had
implor'd thy Presence and thy Succour against the Terri∣ble,
Insolent, Dreadful, Enrag'd, and Undaunted
Enemies and Destroyers; when like Lyons, Bears,
and other Savage Beasts, that have lost their young
ones, they attack'd us after an insolent and terri∣ble
Manner; and terrify'd and wounded, took and killed
us by thousands, us who are thy People: Now as it
is impossible that this should happen without Witchcraft,
and Enchantment, seeing the great Care that we had
taken to fortify our selves after an impregnable Man∣ner,
for the Defence and Security of thy Name. We
beseech thee, O St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> to be our Champion,
and the Bearer of our Standard, to be with us, both
in Peace and in War, and in our Necessities, and at
the Time of our Death to protect us against this horrible
and Tyrannical Crew of Sorcerers, and to drive them
far enough off from our Frontiers, with the Recompence
which they deserve.</P>
<P>It may be hoped I may give a better Account
of Religion among Protestants than I have among
the <HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>Grecian</HI> Churches; and I will, if in
Justice it is possible.</P>
<P>The next to the Nations I have been mention∣ing,
I mean, in Geographical Order, are those
reform'd Christians, call'd <HI>Lutherans;</HI> to say
<PB N="155" REF="171"/>
no worse of them, the Face of Religion indeed is
alter'd much between these and the latter: But I
scarce know what Name to give it, at least as far
as I have enquir'd into it, or what it is like.</P>
<P>It was <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>no Popery;</HI> there was the <HI>Con∣sub.</HI>
but not the <HI>Transub.</HI> The Service differ'd
indeed from <HI>the Mass,</HI> but the Deficiency seem'd
to be made up very much with the Trumpets, Ket∣tle-Drums,
Fiddles, Hautboys, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and all the
<HI>merry Part</HI> of the Popish Devotion; upon which it
occurr'd to me presently, that if there was no
Danger <HI>of Popery</HI> among the <HI>Lutherans,</HI> there was
Danger of <HI>Superstition;</HI> and as for the pious Part, I
saw very little of it in either of them.</P>
<P>By <HI>Religion</HI> therefore, the Reader is desired to un∣derstand
here, not the Principles upon which the
several Nations denominate themselves so much,
as the Manner in which they discover themselves
to be sincere in the Profession which they make.
I had no Inclination here to enter into the Enquiry
after the Creeds, which every Nation profess'd to
believe; but the Manner in which they practised
that Religion which they really profess'd; for,
What is Religion to me without Practice? And
altho' it may be true, that there can be no true
Religion, where it is not profess'd upon right
Principles; yet that which I observe here, and
which to me is the greatest Grievance among
Christians, is the Want of a religious Practice,
even where there are right Principles at Bottom,
and where there is a Profession of the Orthodox
Faith.</P>
<P>In Brief, I am not hunting after the Profession
of Religion, but the Practice: The first I find
almost in every Nation, <HI>Nulla gens tam barbara</HI>—But
the last I am like to travel thro' the Histories
of all Christendom <HI>with my Search,</HI> and per∣haps
<PB N="156" REF="172"/>
may hardly be able, when I have done, to
tell you where it is.</P>
<P>All the Satyr of this Enquiry will look this
Way; for where God has not given a People
the Blessing of a true Knowledge of himself, it
would call for our Pity, not Reproach. It
would be a very dull Satyr indeed, that a Man
should be witty upon the Negroes in <HI>Africa</HI> for
not knowing Christ. and not understanding the
Doctrine of a Saviour: But if turning to our
modern Christians of <HI>Barbadoes</HI> and <HI>Jamaica</HI> for
not teaching them, not instructing them, and
for refusing to baptize them; there the Satyr
would be pointed and seasonable, as we shall hear
farther by and by.</P>
<P>But to return to the <HI>Lutherans,</HI> for there I am
supposed to be at this Time, I mean, among
the Courts and Cities of <HI>Brandenburgh, Saxo∣ny,
&amp;c.</HI> I had Opportunity here to view a Court,
affecting Gallantry, Magnificence, and gay things,
to such a Height, and with such a Passion, to ex∣ceed
the whole World in that empty Part of hu∣man
Felicity, call'd <HI>Show,</HI> that I thought it was
impossible to pursue it with such an impetuous
Torrent of the Affections, without sacrificing all
things to it, which wise Men esteem more va∣luable.</P>
<P>Nor was my Notion wrong; for the first thing
I found sacrific'd, as I say, to this voluptuous
Humour, was the Liberties of the People, who
being by Constitution or Custom, rather under ab∣solute
Government, and at the arbitrary Will
of the Prince, are sure to pay, not all they can
spare, but even all they have, to gratify the un∣bounded
Appetite of a Court given up to Plea∣sure
and Exorbitance.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="173"/>
By all I have read of the Manner of Living
there, both Court and People; the latter are
entirely given up to the former; not by Ne∣cessity
only, but by the Consent of Custom, and
the general Way of Management thro' the whole
Country; nay, this is carry'd to s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch a Height,
that as I have been told, the King's Coffers are
the general Cess-Pool of the Nations, whither all
the Money of the Kingdoms flow, and only dis∣perses
again, as that gives it out; whether by
running over or running out at its proper Vent,
I do not enquire; so that as all the Blood in the
human Body circulates in 24 Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs thro' the
Ventricles of the Heart, so all the Money in the
Kingdom is said to pass once a Year thro' the
King's Treasury.</P>
<P>How far Poverty and Misery may prompt
Piety and Devotion among the poor Inhabi∣tants,
I cannot say: But if Luxury and Gallan∣try,
together with Tyranny and Oppression to
support it, can subsist with true Religion in the
great Men, than for ought I know, the Courts of
<HI>Prussia</HI> and <HI>Dresden</HI> may be the best qualify'd in the
World to produce this Thing call'd Religion,
which I have hitherto seen, is hard to be found.</P>
<P>It is true, that the Magnificence of the wisest
King in the World in <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> was esteemed
the Felicity of his People: B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t it seems to be ex∣press'd
very elegantly, not as a Testimony of
his Glory only, but of the flourishing Condition
of his People at the same Time, under the pros∣perous
Circumstances which his Reign brought
them to, <HI>viz.</HI> That he made Gold to be for Plen∣ty
like the Stones in the Streets, amply expressing
the flo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rishing Condition of his People under
him.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="174"/>
I have likewise read indeed, and heard much of
the same Kind of the King of <HI>Prussia,</HI> and that
even from his own Subjects, who were always full
of the generous and truly royal Qualities of that
Prince: He was the first King of the Country,
which before was a Dukedom or Electorate only:
The Summ of their Discourse is, That his Maje∣sty
was so true a Father of his Country and of his
People, that his whole care was the Flourishing
of their Trade, establishing their Manufactures,
encreasing their Numbers, planting Foreigners,
<HI>French, Swiss,</HI> and other Nations, among them,
to instruct and encourage them; and being noway
accessory to any of their Oppressions, but relieving
and redressing all their Grievances, as often and
as soon as they came to his Knowledge:
And indeed, I could not but entertain a great
Regard to the Character of so just and good a
Prince. But all I could infer from that was, That
a Government may be tyrannical, and yet the
King not be a Tyrant; but the Grievances to the
People are oftentimes much the same: And every
Administration, where the Constitution is thus
stated, as it seems to be in most, if not all of the
Northern Courts, Protestant as well as others,
seems inconsistent with the true Ends of Govern∣ment;
the thing we call Government was certain∣ly
established for the Prosperity of the People;
Whereas; on the contrary, in all those <HI>German</HI>
Courts, where I have made my Observations, the
Magnificence of the Court, and the Prosperity of
the People, stand like the two Poles; what Ex∣cess
of Light you see at one, is exactly balanced by
so much Dark<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess at t'other.</P>
<P>And where, pray, is the Religion of all this?
That a whole Nation of People should appear
miserable, that their Governours may appear gay,
<PB N="159" REF="175"/>
the People starve, that the Prince may be fed;
or rather, the People be lean, that their Sovereign
may be fat; the Subjects sigh, that he may laugh;
be empty, that he may be full; and all this for
meer Luxury, not for the needful Defence of the
Government, resisting Enemies, preserving the
public Peace, and the like, but for meer Extra∣vagance,
Luxury, and Magnificence, as in <HI>Prussia;</HI>
or for Ambition, and pushing at Crowns, and the
Lust of Domination, as in <HI>Saxony.</HI></P>
<P>But to come back to the religious Transactions
of these Countries, How are the Ecclesiastics
jealous of their Hierarchy, afraid to reform far∣ther,
least, as they gave a mortal Stabb to the
Perquisites and Vails of God Almighty's Ser∣vice
in the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, modern Reformation
might give the like to them? For this Reason
they set a Pale about their Church, and there,
as well as in other Places, they cry to their
Neighbours, <HI>Stand off, I am holier than thou;</HI> and
with what Persecution and Invasion, persecuting
for Religion, and invading the Principles of one
another. If there was any Peace among them,
it was that only which <HI>passes all Understanding.</HI> It
presently occurr'd to me, what Charity can here
be, where there is no Peace? And what Religion,
where is no Charity? And I began to fear I should
find little of what I look'd for in those odd Cli∣mates.</P>
<P>I had travell'd personally thro' the Heart of
<HI>France,</HI> where I had Occasion to look round me
often enough in my Rout from the Foot of the
<HI>Pyrenean</HI> Mountains to <HI>Thoulouse,</HI> from thence to
<HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Calais.</HI> Here I found the People so mer∣ry,
and yet so miserable, that I knew not where to
make any Judgment. The Poverty of the Poor
was so great, that it seem'd to leave them no
<PB N="160" REF="176"/>
room to sigh for any thing, but their Burthens, or
to pray for any thing, but Bread: But the Tem∣per
of the People was so volatile, that I thought,
they went always dancing to Church, and came
singing out of it.</P>
<P>I found a World of Teachers here, but no body
taught: The Streets were every where full of
Priests, and the Churches full of Women, But as
for Religion, I found most of the Clergy were so far
from having much of it, that few of them knew
what it was. Never sure was a Nation so full of
truly <HI>blind Guides;</HI> for nothing can be more gross∣ly
ignorant of Religion, than many of their Cler∣gy
are; nothing more void of Morals, than many
of those to whom other People go to confess their
Sins.</P>
<P>I made some Enquiry about Religion; and a∣mong
the rest, I happen'd to fall in Company with
a good honest Hugonot <HI>incognito;</HI> and he told me
very honestly, that the State of Religion in <HI>France</HI>
stood thus: First, That for some Years ago it was
put to the Test by the King, and that was, when
the Edicts came out to banish and ruin the Hugo∣nots;
at which Time, <HI>said he,</HI> we thought there
had been a great deal of Religion in it: But really
when it came to the Push, <HI>said he,</HI> it was hard to
tell where we should find it. The Persecution, as
it was thought at first, would be ingrateful to the
more religious Roman-Catholicks, and that some
would be found too good to do the Drudgery of
the Devil: But we were mistaken, the best fell
in with Persecution, when it was done by other
Hands, and not their own; and those that would
not do it, acknowledg'd they rejoic'd that it was
done; which shew'd, <HI>said he,</HI> that the Catholicks
<PB N="161" REF="177"/>
either had no Principle, or acted against Principle,
which is much at one. And as for us Hugonots,
<HI>says he,</HI> we have shewn that we have no Religion
lost among us: For first, some run away for their Re∣ligion,
and yet left it behind them, and we that stay'd
behind did it at the Price of our Principles: For now,
<HI>says he,</HI> we are meer Hypocrites, neither Papists nor
Hugonots, for we go to Mass with Protestant
Hearts; and while we call our selves Protestants,
we bow in the House of <HI>Rimmon,</HI> Where then, <HI>said I,</HI>
is the Religion, once boasted of here, to be found?
Indeed, <HI>said he,</HI> it is hard to tell you, and except a
little that is in the Galleys, I can give you no good
Account of it. This indeed was confining the
Remains of a flourishing Church to about 350
Confessors, who really suffer'd Martyrdom for it,
for it was no less; so I minuted down <HI>French</HI> Reli∣gion,
tugging at the Oar, and would have come
away.</P>
<P>But it came into my Thought to ask him, What
he meant by telling me, that those who run away
for their Religion out of <HI>France,</HI> left most of it
behind them? He answer'd, I should judge of it
better, if I observ'd them when I came into my
own Country; where, if I found they liv'd better
than other People, or shew'd any thing of Reli∣gion
suitable to a People that suffer'd Persecution
for their Profession, I should send Word of it; for
he had heard quite otherwise of them, which
was the Reason why he and Thousands of others
did not follow them.</P>
<P>It happen'd, while I was warm in my Enqui∣ries
thus after Religion, a Proclamation came
out in <HI>London,</HI> for appointing a General Thanks∣giving,
for a great Victory obtain'd by the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Forces and their Confederates, over the <HI>French</HI>
at—I care not to put Names to the parti∣cular
Times of things.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="178"/>
I started at the Noise, when they cry'd it in the
Streets: Hah, <HI>said I,</HI> then I have found it at last;
and I rejoyc'd in particular, that having look'd so
much abroad for Religion, I should find it out
at home: Then I began to call myself a thousand
Fools, that I had not sav'd myself all this Labour,
and look'd at home first; tho' by the By, I had
done no more in this than other Travellers often,
or indeed generally do, <HI>viz.</HI> go abroad to see the
World, and search into the Curiosities of foreign
Countries, and know nothing of their own.</P>
<P>But to return to my Observations: I was re∣solv'd
to see the Ceremonies of this pious Piece of
Work; and as the Preparations for it were prodi∣gious
great, I enquir'd how it would be; but no
body could remember that the like had ever been
in their Time before: Every one said, it would
be very fine, that the Queen would be there her
self, and all the Nobility; and that the like had
never been seen since Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Time.</P>
<P>This pleased me exceedingly; and I began to
form Ideas in my Mind, of what had been in for∣mer
Times among religious Nations; I could
find nothing of what I was made to expect, unless
it was <HI>Solomen</HI>'s Dedication of the Temple, or <HI>Jo∣siah</HI>'s
Great Feast of the Reformation; and I ex∣pected
God would have a most royal Tribute of
Praise.</P>
<P>But it shock'd me a little, that the People said
there had never been such a Thansgiving since
Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Time. What thought I can be
the Reason of that? and musing a little, O! says I
to myself, now I have found it: I suppose, no bo∣dy
gives God Thanks in our Country, but Queens:
But this look'd a little harsh; and I rumag'd our
Histories a little for my farther Satisfaction, but
could make nothing of it: At last, talking of it
<PB N="163" REF="179"/>
to a good old Cavalier, that had been a Soldier
for King <HI>Charles,</HI> O, <HI>says he,</HI> I can tell you the
Reason of it: They have never given Thanks, <HI>says
he,</HI> because they have had nothing to give Thanks
for. Pray, <HI>says he,</HI> When have they had any Vi∣ctories
in <HI>England</HI> since Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Time,
except two or three in <HI>Ireland</HI> in King <HI>William</HI>'s
Time; and then they were so busy, had so many
other Losses with them abroad, that they were
asham'd to give Thanks for them.</P>
<P>This I found had too much Truth in it, howe∣ver
bitter the Jest of it: But still heighten'd my
Expectation, and made me look for some strange
Seriousness, and religious Thanksfulness in the Ap∣pearance
that was to be on the Occasion in Hand;
and accordingly I secur'd myself a Place, both
without and within the Church, where I might be
a Witness to every Part of the Devotionand Joy
People.</P>
<P>But my Expectations were wound up to a yet grea∣ter
Pitch, when I saw the infinite Crowds of Peo∣ple
throng with so much Zeal, <HI>as I, like a charitable
C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>comb, thought it to be,</HI> to the Place of the Worship
of God; and when I considered, that it was to give
God Thanks for a great Victory, I could think of
nothing else than the Joy of the <HI>Israelites,</HI> when
they landed on the Banks of the Sea, and saw <HI>Pha∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI>'s
Army, Horses, and Chariots, swallow'd up
behind them; and I doubted not I should hear
something like the Song of <HI>Moses</HI> and the Chil∣dren
of <HI>Israel,</HI> on the Occasion, and should hear it
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with the same Elevation of Soul.</P>
<P>But when I came to the Point, the first thing I
observ'd was, That nine Parts of ten of all the
Company, came there only to see the Queen, and
the Show, and the other tenth Part, I think, might
be said to make the Show.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="180"/>
When the Queen came to the Rails, and de∣scended
from her Coach, the People, instead of
crying out <HI>Hos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nah,</HI> blessed be the Queen that
cometh in the Name of the Lord; I say, the Peo∣ple
cry'd Murder, and Help, for God's sake,
treading upon one another, and stifling one ano∣ther,
at such a rate, that in the Rear of the two
Lines or Crowds of People, thro' which the Queen
Pass'd, it look'd something like a Battle, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
the wound<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> were retir'd to die, and to get Sur∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons
to come to them, for there lay Heaps of
Women and Children dragg'd from among the
Fe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the Crowd, and gasping for Breath. I
went among some of them, and ask'd them, What
made them go into such a Crowd? And their An∣swer
was all the same, O Sir, I had a Mind to see
the Queen, as the rest did.</P>
<P>Well, I had my Answer here indeed; for in
short, the whole Business of the Thanksgiving
without Doors, was to see the Queen, that was
plain; so I went away to my Stand, which, for
no less than three Guineas, I had secur'd in the
Church.</P>
<P>When I came there, it was my Fate to be pla∣ced
between the Seats, where the Men of God
reform'd the Service of his Praise, and sung out
the Anthems and the <HI>Te Deum,</HI> which celebrated
the religious Triumph of the Day.</P>
<P>As to the Men themselves, I lik'd their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
their Vest<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ents, and their Appearance; all look'd
awful and grave enough, suitable in some Respects
to the Solemnity of a religious Triumph; and I
expected they would be as solemn in their Perfor∣mances,
as the <HI>Levites</HI> that blow'd the Trumpets
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t <HI>Solemen</HI>'s Feast, when all the People shouted and
praised God.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="181"/>
But I observed these grave People, in the In∣tervals
of their worshipping God, when it was
not their Turn to sing, or read, or pray, bestow'd
some of the rest of their Time in taking Snuff, ad∣justing
their Perukes, looking about at the fair La∣dies,
whispering, and that not very softly neither
to one another, about this fine Lady, that pretty
Woman, this fine Dutchess, and that great For∣tune,
and not without some Indecencies, as well
of Words, as of Gestures. Well, <HI>says I,</HI> you are
none of the People I look for, where are they that
give God Thanks?</P>
<P>Immediately the Organ struck up for the <HI>Te De∣um;</HI>
up starts all my Gentlemen, as if inspir'd from
above, and from their talking together, not over
modestly, fall to praising God with the utmost Pre∣cipitation,
singing the heavenly Anthems, with all
the Grace and Music imaginable.</P>
<P>In the Middle of all this Musick and these exalted
things, when I thought my Soul elevated with di∣vine
Melody, and began to be reconcil'd to all the
rest, I saw a little rustling Motion among the Peo∣ple,
as if they had been disturb'd or frighted:
Some said it thunder'd, some said the Church shook.
The true Business was, the <HI>Te Deum</HI> within was
answer'd without by the Thunder of 100 Pieces
of Cannon, and the Noise of Drums, with the
Huzza's and Shouts of great Crowds of People in
the Streets. This I did not understand, so it did
neither disturb or concern me; I found indeed no
great Harmony in it; it bore no Consort in the
Music, at least, as I understood it; but it was
over pretty soon, and so we went on.</P>
<P>When the Anthem was sung, and the other Ser∣vices
succeeded them, I that had been a little di∣sturb'd
with the lucid Intervals of the Choristers,
and the Gentlemen that sat crowded in with
<PB N="166" REF="182"/>
them, turn'd my Eyes to other Places, in Hopes
I should find some Saints among the Crowd, whose
Souls were taken up with the exalted Raptures of
the Day.</P>
<P>But alas, it was all one, the Ladies were busy
singling out the Men, and the Men the Ladies.
The Star and Garter of a fine young Nobleman,
beautiful in Person, rich in Habit, and sparkling
in Jewels, his blew Ribbond intimating his Cha∣racter,
drew the Eyes of so many Women off of
their Prayer Books, that I think his Grace ought
to have been spoken to by the Vergers, to have
withdrawn out of the Church, that he might
not injure the Service, and rob God Almighty of
the Homage of the Day.</P>
<P>As for the Queen, her Majesty was the Star of
the Day, and infinitely more Eyes were directed
to her than were lifted up to Heaven, tho' the
last was the Business of the whole Procession.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>said I,</HI> this is mighty fine, that's true:
But where's the Religion of all this? Heavens
bless me, <HI>said I,</HI> out of this Crowd, and I'll ne∣ver
mock God any more here, when the Queen
comes again. Cannot these People go and see the
Queen, where the Queen is to be seen, but must
they come hither to prophane the Church with
her, and make the Queen an Idol? And in a great
Passion I was both at the People and at the Man∣ner
of the Day, as you may easily see by what
follows.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> I had made some other satyrical Reflections
upon the Conduct of the Day; but as it looks
too near home, I am not willing, that poor <HI>Ro∣binson
Cr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> should disoblige any body.</P>
<P>I confess, the Close of the Day was still more
extravagant; for there the Thanksgiving was ad∣journed
from the Church to the Tavern, and to
<PB N="167" REF="183"/>
the Street; and instead of the Decency of a reli∣gious
Triumph, there was indeed a Triumph of
religious indecency, and the Anthems <HI>Te Deum</HI>
and Thanksgiving of the Day ended in the Drun∣kenness,
the Bonefires, and the Squibs and Crac∣kers
of the Street.</P>
<P>How far Religion is concern'd in all this, or
whether God Almighty will accept of this noisy
Doings for Thanksgivings, that I have nothing
to do with; let those People consider of it, that are
concern'd in it.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Of Differences in Religion.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>IS known alone to the Divine Wisdom,
why he has been pleased to suffer any
Part of Religion, and the Adoration
paid to his Majesty, the Supplications
made to him, and the Homage which his Crea∣tures
owe to his glorious Being, to be so doubt∣fully
directed, or so differently understood by his
Creatures, as that there should be any Mistakes or
Disagreements about them.</P>
<P>How comes it to pass, that the paying a Re∣verence
to the Name and Being of God, should
not be as uncapable of being disputed in the Man∣ner
of it, as in the thing itself? That all the Rules
of Worshipping, Believing in, and Serving the Great
God of Heaven and Earth, should be capable of
being understood any more than one Way? And that
the Infallible Spirit of God, who is our Guide
<PB N="168" REF="184"/>
to Heaven, should leave any one of its Dictates
in a State of being misunderstood?</P>
<P>Why have not the Rules of Religion, as well
those of Doctrine as of Life, been laid down in
Terms so plain, and so impossible to be mistaken,
that all Men in the World in every Age, should
have the same Notions of them, and understand them
in every Title of them exactly alike? Then as Hea∣ven
is but one blessed great Port, at which all Hope
to arrive, there would have been but one Road
to travel the Journey in; all Men would have gone
the same Way, steer'd the same Course; and
Brethren would no more have fallen out by the
Way.</P>
<P>God alone, who for wise and righteous Rea∣sons,
because he can do nothing but what is wise
and righteous, has otherwise order'd it, and that
is all we can say of it: As to the Reason and Ju∣stice
of it, that is a thing, of which, like as of
the Times and of the Seasons, we may say, <HI>Know∣eth
no Man.</HI></P>
<P>In the State of Uncertainty we are now in, so
it is; two Men believing in the same God, holding
the same Faith, the same Saviour, the same Do∣ctrine,
and aiming at the same Heaven; yet can∣not
agree to go to that Heaven, or worship
that God, or believe in that Saviour the same Way,
or after the same Manner: Nay, they cannot
know, or conceive of God, or of Heaven, or of the
Redeemer, or indeed of any one Principle of the
Christian Religion, in the same Manner, or form
the same Ideas of these things in their Minds.</P>
<P>It is true, the different Capacities and Faculties
of Men, are in Part a Reason for this; by which
it is occasioned, that scarce two Men together
have the same Notions and Apprehensions even of
one and the same thing, because their Understan∣dings
<PB N="169" REF="185"/>
are led by different Guides, and they see by
different Lights.</P>
<P>But this is not all; they are not alike honest to
the Light they have: Three Men read the same do∣ctrinal
Article, say it be of the Trinity, or of any
other, and they all examine the Foundation of it in
the Scripture. One thinks verily he has found out
the Mystery effectually, goes on with his Enquiries,
and brings every Scripture and every Passage to
correspond exactly with his first Notion; and thus
he confirms himself immoveably in his Opinion;
and it is so clear to him, that he can not only ne∣ver
be argued out of it, but can entertain no good
Opinion of any Man, that conceives of it in any
other Way, but takes him for an Enemy to the
Orthodox Doctrine, and that he merits to be ex∣pell'd
out of Christ's Church, deny'd the Christian
Communion; and in short, treats him with no Re∣spect,
no nor thinks of him with Charity.</P>
<P>Another comes to the same Scripture, and in
quest of the same Doctrine, and he reads over the
same Texts, and recieves Motions from them di∣rectly
opposite to the other, or at least, very re∣mote
from them: He follows in his Search thro'
all the corroborating Texts, and is confirm'd in
his first Opinion from them all: He grows as
immoveable in his receiv'd Construction of the
Scripture, as the other; and all is so clear to him,
that he not only can never be argued out of his
Opinion, but can entertain no good Opinion of
any Man that conceives of it any other Way,
but takes him for an Enemy to the Orthodox
Doctrine.</P>
<P>The third Man, he reads over all the same
Texts of Scripture, but doing it with an Indiffe∣rency
as to the Substance, and whether he re∣ceives
right information or no, truly he comes
<PB N="170" REF="186"/>
way with a Calmness of Mind as to the Substance;
and as he went with no great Concern about being
certain, so he comes back as uncertain as he went.</P>
<P>These three Men are enough to fill the whole
World full of Disputes about Religion. The first
two meet, and being equally positive of their being
infallibly guided, equally warm in defending their
Opinions, and equally tenacious of them, and above
all equally void of Charity to the other; truly they
fall our, Part, condemn, censure, revile, and as Op∣portunity
and Power offers, at last, persecute
one another, and all one anothers Adherents.</P>
<P>The third, half inform'd indifferent Man, he
comes in between these two, laughs at them both,
says they are a Parcel of furious Christians, that
the thing is not absolutely necessary to be known,
that it is no Article of Faith, so as that with∣out
deciding it, a Man cannot be sav'd; says,
they are a Parcel of Fools to fall out thus about
what they cannnot be certain of, and which they
may go to Heaven tho' they should not understand
it till they come there: And thus the World comes
to be divided.</P>
<P>Could they differ with Humility, they would
differ with Charity; but it is not to be, in Religi∣on,
whatever it may be in civil or politick Affairs;
for there is a thing called <HI>Zeal,</HI> which Men call
<HI>a Grace</HI> in Religion, and esteem a Duty; and this
makes Men fall out in religious Matters, with a
more fatal Warmth, and more Animosity, than in
other Cases, according to <HI>Hudibrass.</HI></P>
<Q><L>“Zeal makes men fight like mad or drunk,</L>
<L>For Dame Religion as for Punk.”</L></Q>
<P>Nor is this the Fate only of the Christian Religi∣on,
tho' 'tis more so there than in any other; but 'tis
<PB N="171" REF="187"/>
the same in other Cases, as between the <HI>Persians</HI>
and the <HI>Turks,</HI> about the Successors of their Pro∣phet
<HI>Mahomet.</HI> It was so of Old between the
<HI>Heathen</HI> and the <HI>Jews:</HI> And the <HI>Assyrian</HI> Monarch
prepar'd a fiery Furnace for those that would not fall
down and worship the great Image that he had set
up.</P>
<P>In the Primitive Times of God's Church, the
Heathen did die like by the Christians, and <HI>Christia∣nos
Ad Leones</HI> was the common Cry: But when the
Church came to its Halcyon-Days, <HI>Constantine the
Great</HI> gave Peace to the Christians, and it was but a
little While that they enjoy'd that Peace, before
they fell out by the Way, the Arian Heresies rose
up, and differing Opinions rent the State into Fa∣ctions,
the Church into Schisms, and in the Space
of two Reigns, the Arians persecuted the Ortho∣dox,
and the Orthodox the Arians, almost with
the same Fury as the Heathen had persecutet<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h em
both with before.</P>
<P>From thence to our Time, Persecution has been
the Practice even of all Parties, as they have been
clothed with Power, and as their Differences have
mov'd them: For Example, in all the Christian
Countries, there is a mortal Feud between Popish
and Protestant; and tho' indeed the former have
carry'd their Zeal farthest, yet the latter have not
been able to say they have not persecuted in their
Turn, tho' not with Fire and Faggot.</P>
<P>What Wars and Bloodshed molested <HI>Europe</HI> on
the Account of Religion in <HI>Germany?</HI> especially
till the general Pacification of those Troubles at
the Treaty of <HI>Westphalia?</HI> when the Protestants
having had the apparent Advantage of the War,
obtain'd the everlasting Settlement of their Religi∣on,
as well as Liberties thro' the whole Empire.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="188"/>
Since those times, what Persecution in the same
Country, between the Lutheran and Calvinist
Churches? And how little Charity is among them?
insomuch, that the Lutherans to this Day will not
allow the reformed Evangelick Churches, so the
Calvinists are call'd, Liberty to assemble for Worship
within the Gates of their Cities, or give them
Christian Burial.</P>
<P>I avoid looking too near Home, or searching in
<HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England</HI> among the unhappy Divisi∣ons
of Episcopal and Presbyterian, Church of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
and Dissenter; and this I do, because it is at
Home: But it is too evident, that all these come
either from Mens being negligent of right Informa∣tions,
or too tenacious when they have it; for 'tis
evident, if all Men would be honest to the Light
they have, and favourable to their Neighbours, we
might hope, that how many several Ways soever,
we chose to walk towards Heaven, we should all
meet there at last.</P>
<P>I look upon all the Seeds of religious Dissen∣tion,
as Tares sow'd by the Devil among the
Wheat: And it may be observed, that tho' as I
have already said, the <HI>Assyrians</HI> persecuted the Jews,
and the <HI>Romans</HI> the Christians; yet where the
Devil is immediately and personally worshipped,
there we meet with little or no Persecution; for
Satan having a kind of peaceable Dominion there,
offers them no Disturbance: He desires no Inno∣vation
for ever; he finds the Sweetness of it, and
lets it all alone.</P>
<P>But if once they talk of <HI>other Gods Before him,</HI>
he is far less easy; there he is continually sowing
Strife, and hatching Divisions among them; <HI>for
like all other Menarchs,</HI> the Devil loves to reign
alone.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="189"/>
It would be too long a Task here, to reckon up
the several Sorts of Differences in Religion, even
among us in <HI>England;</HI> where, if two happen to
differ, presently like St. <HI>Paul</HI> to St. <HI>Peter,</HI> they
<HI>withstand one another to the Face;</HI> that is to say, car∣ry
on the Dispute to the utmost Extremity.</P>
<P>But there is another Question before me, and
that is not only, Why there are such Differences
in the Points of Religion? And, why are religi∣ous
Differences hotter and more irreconcilable
than other Breaches? But, why are there more
Differences of this Kind among us, than among
any other Nation in the World?</P>
<P>Certainly this pushing on our religious Broils to
the Extremity, is the Peculiar of this Country of
<HI>England,</HI> and is not the same thing in other Places;
and the Variety is such here, that 'tis said, there
are more several Communions or Communities of
religious Kinds in <HI>England,</HI> than in all the other
Protestant Countries in the World.</P>
<P>The best and most charitable Answer that I
can think of to give for this, is to compliment
our selves, and say, 'tis because we are the most
religious Nation in the World; that is to say,
that we in general set more seriously to work, to
enquire into the Substance and Nature of Religion;
to examine Principles, and weigh the Reasons of
things, than other People; being more concern'd
for, and anxious about, the Affairs of God, of
Heaven, and our Souls; that thinking, as we
ought to do, that Religion is of the utmost Con∣cern
to us, and that it is of the last Moment to us
to be certain about it, and well grounded in the
Points before us, particularly whether we are rightly
inform'd or not; this anxious Concern makes us jea∣lous
of every Opinion and Tenacious of our own,
breaks much in upon the Custom of submitting
<PB N="174" REF="190"/>
our Judgments to the Clergy, as is the Case in
Countries, where People are more indifferent in
their Search after these things, and more uncon∣cern'd
in the Certainty Or Uncertainty of them.</P>
<P>I must acknowledge, that I think the true
and the only just Reason that can be given for this
Matter, is not, that we are more furious
than other People, more censorious and rash in our
Judgment, that we have less Charity, or less Pa∣tience,
in debating religious Points, than other
People: But the Truth is, that we have less In∣difference
about them; and we cannot sit down
contented with a Slight and overly Enquiry, or a
Cursory or School Answer to the Doubts in Que∣stion:
But we make it a Thing of absolute necessi∣ty,
to be fully inform'd of, and therefore are ear∣nest
in the Enquiry, and knowing the Scripture
to be the great Rule of Faith, the Standard for
Life and Doctrine, we flie thither and search for
our selves, not having Popery enough to expect an
infallible Judge, not Indifference enough to acqui∣esce
in the Judgment of the Clergy; and perhaps a
little too tenacious of out own Interpretation,
even in things we are uninstructed about.</P>
<P>This indeed I take to be the true Reason why
religious Disputes encrease so much here, and why
there are such Separations and Schisms among us,
more than they are in any other Nation in the
World.</P>
<P>I know much of it is laid to the Door of the
Confusions they were all in here, during the bloody
intestine Wars in the Years 1640 to 1656, and the
Liberty given to all Opinions to set up themselves
at that Time: But I wave that as a Question that
tends to more Division. I believe, the Reason I
have given for it, stands as well grounded, and as
<PB N="175" REF="191"/>
likely to be approved as any I can give, or as any
that has been given in this Case.</P>
<P>There is another difficult Question, which still
remains before us; and that is, What Remedy
can we apply to this Malady? And first, I must
answer negatively; not to have us be less religious,
that we might differ less about it: But to have
us exercise more Charity in our Disputes, that we
might differ more like Men of Temper, and more
like Christians, than we do: This is striking at
the Root of religious Differences; for if they were
carry'd on mildly with a peaceable Spirit, willing
to be inform'd, a Disposition to Love as Brethren,
tho in every thing not like minded: Our Variety
of Opinions would not then have the Name of
Differences, we should not separate in Communion
and in Charity, tho' we did not agree in every
thing we were to believe or not believe, about
Religion.</P>
<P>It is hard that we should say these Differences
are the Consequences of a Nation, having more
Religion than their Neighbours, since we have
still this one Part too little; and as I suppose us
to have more Religion, I must be oblig'd to grant
we have not <HI>enough more;</HI> for if, as we have just so
much more Religion, as is sufficient to make us
quarrelsome in religious Disputes; we had yet
as much more, as were sufficient to make us
peaceable again after it, then we should be reli∣gious
to Purpose.</P>
<P>So that, in a Word, our being so religious, as
above, is only an unhappy middle Composition
between the enquiring and fully inform'd Christi∣an
on one Hand, and the careless, indifferent, un∣concern'd
Temper, that takes up with any thing,
on the other Hand: And this I take to be a just tho'
<PB N="176" REF="192"/>
short Account of our <HI>Differences in</HI> England <HI>about
Religion.</HI></P>
<P>It might be a very useful Question to start here,
namely where all our unhappy religious Differences
will end. I that am not willing to give the worst
natur'd Answer, where the best and kindest will
hold Water, am for the present dispos'd to answer
in general, rather than descend to Particulars, <HI>viz.</HI> in
<HI>Heaven:</HI> There all our unkind, unchristian, unneigh∣bourly,
unbrotherly Differences will end: We shall
freely shake Hands there with many a pardon'd
Sinner, that here <HI>we bid stand off;</HI> embrace many a
Publican, that here we think it a Dishonour to con∣verse
with; see many a Heart that we have broken
herewith Censures, Reproachings, and Revilings,
made whole again by the Balm of the same Re∣deemer's
Blood.</P>
<P>There we shall see, that there have been other
Flocks than those of our Fold, other Paths to
Heaven than those we shut Men out from; that
those we have excommunicated have been taken
into that superiour Communion; and those we
have plac'd at our Left-hands, have been there sum∣mon'd
to the Right-hand; all Separations will
be there taken away, and the Mind of every Chri∣stian
be entirely reconcild to one another; no Di∣visions,
no Differences, no charging sincere Minds
with Hypocrisy, or embracing painted Hypocrites
for Saints; every thing to be seen, and to be
known, as it really is, and by a clear Light; none
will desire to deceive, none be subject to be de∣ceived.</P>
<P>There we shall look upon all we have done and
said in Prejudice of the Character of our Brethren
with a just Change, and sufficiently repair to one
another all the injurious things we have said, or
indeed but thought of one another, by rejoicing
<PB N="177" REF="193"/>
in the common Felicity, and praising the sove∣reign
Glory, that had receiv'd those we had foo∣lishly
rejected, and let those into the same Heaven,
whom we had in the Abundance of our Pride, and
the Penury of our Charity, shut out.</P>
<P>How many Actions of Men, which we, seeing
only their Out-side, have now censur'd, shall we
find there, by that Penetration that cannot err, be
accepted for their in side Sincerity? How many
an Opinion, that we condemn here, shall we see
then to be Orthodox? In a Word, How many
contradicting Notions and Principles, which we
thought inconsistent with true Religion, shall we
find then to be reconcilable to themselves, to one
another, and to the Fountain of Truth?</P>
<P>All the Difficulties in our Conceptions of things
invisible, will then be explain'd; all the Doctrines
of the Immutability of the divine Councils will
then be reconcilable to the changeable Events of
things, and to the Varieties often happening in
the World: The Unchangeableness of the eternal
Decrees will then appear; and yet the Efficacy of
praying to God to do this, or not do that, to
pardon, forgive, spare, and forbear, which we
now say is inconsistent with those unchangeable
Decrees, shall be reconcilable to that Unchange∣ableness,
in a Manner to us now inconceiveable.</P>
<P>And this is the Foundation of what I now ad∣vance,
<HI>viz.</HI> That in Heaven all our Differences in
Religion will be reconcil'd, and will be at an End.
If any Man ask me, whether they cannot be ended
before? I answer, If we were all thoroughly con∣vinc'd,
that they would be reconcil'd then, we
should certainly put an End to them before; but
'tis impossible to be done. Mens Convictions of
the greatest and most certain Truths, are
not equal to one another, or equal to the
<PB N="178" REF="194"/>
Weight and Significancy of those Truths; and
therefore, such a general Effect of this Affair can∣not
be expected on this Side of Time.</P>
<P>There is one very great Reconciler of religious
Differences in this World, which has sometimes
been made use of by Providence to heal the Breaches
in Christian Charity among religious People; and
it is, generally speaking, very effectual: But it is
a bitter Draught, a Potion that goes down with
great Reluctance, and that is PERSECUTION. This
generally reconciles the Differences of Christians,
about the lesser Matters in Religion: The Primi∣tive
Churches, while under the <HI>Roman</HI> Persecutions,
had a much greater Harmony among themselves,
and very few Schisms and Divisions broke out a∣mong
them. When they did differ in any Parti∣cular
Points, they wrote healing Epistles to one
another, contended with Modesty and with Cha∣rity,
and referr'd willingly their Notions to be de∣cided
by one another. They did not separate Com∣munion,
and excommunicate whole Churches and
Nations, for a Dispute about the Celebration of
<HI>Easter,</HI> or unchurch one another for the Question
of receiving and re-baptizing of Penitents, as was
afterwards the Case. The Furnace of Affliction
burnt up all that Dross, the Fury of their Perse∣cutors
kept their Minds humble, their Zeal for
Religion hot, and their Affection for, and Charity
to one another encreased as their Liberty, and their
Number was lessened.</P>
<P>Thus Bishop <HI>Ridley,</HI> and Bishop <HI>Hooper;</HI> the first,
a rigid Church of <HI>England</HI> Bishop, the other, almost
a Presbyterian, or at least a Calvinist, like <HI>Peter</HI>
and <HI>Paul,</HI> differ'd hotly, and withstood one ano∣ther
to the Face, in the very Beginning of the Re∣formation:
But when they came to burn for their
Religion, Fire and Faggot shew'd them the Re∣concileableness
<PB N="179" REF="195"/>
of all their Disputes; convinc'd
them, that it was possible for both to hold fast
the Truth in Sincerity, a and yet entertain differing
Notions of the Rites and Outsides of the divine
O Economy, and at the Stake they ended all their
Disputes, wrote healing Letters to one another,
and became Fellow-Martyrs and Confessors for
that very Profession which was so intermix'd with
Censure and Dislike before.</P>
<P>And let all that think of this Remedy remem∣ber,
that whenever these quarrelsome Christians
come, by Persecution, or any other Incident, to
be thus reconcil'd in their Charity, they find al∣ways
a great deal to ask Pardon of one another
for, with respect to what is past; all their Violence,
Heat of Zeal, and much more Heat of Passion,
all their Breach of Charity, their Reproaches and
Censures, and hard Words, which have pass'd be∣tween
them, will only then serve to bring them
together with more Affection, and to Embrace
more warmly; for, depend upon it, all the Diffe∣rences
in Religion among good Men, (<HI>for I do
not mean Essential, Doctrinal, and Fundamental
Differences</HI>) serve only to make them all asham'd
of themselves at last.</P>

<HEAD>Of the wonderful Excellency of
Negative Religion, and Negative
Virtue</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">N</SEG>Egative Virtue sets out like the Phari∣see,
with <HI>God I thank thee;</HI> 'tis a Piece
of religious Pageantry; a jointed Baby
dress'd up gay, but stript of its Gew∣gaws,
it appears a naked Lump, fit only to please
Children and deceive Fools. 'Tis <HI>the Hope of the
Hypocrite,</HI> 'tis a Cheat upon the Neighbourhood,
a Dress for without Doors, for 'tis of no Use
within; 'tis a Mask put on for a Character, and
as generally 'tis used to cheat others, 'tis so igno∣ranly
embrac'd, that we cheat even ourselves
with it.</P>
<P>In a Word, <HI>Negative</HI> Virtue is <HI>Positive</HI> Vice, at
least when it is made use of in any of the two last
Cases; namely, Either as a <HI>Mask</HI> to deceive others,
or as a <HI>Mist</HI> to deceive ourselves. If a Man were
to look back upon it, to see in what Part he
could take up his Nest, or lay a Foundation of
Hope for the Satisfaction of his Mind, as to fu∣ture
things, he would find it the most uncom∣fortable
Condition to go out of the World with,
that any Man in the World can think.</P>
<P>The Reason is plain, compare it with the Pub∣lican,
whom such a Man despises: Here is my
Landlord is a Drunkard, one of my Tenants is a
Thief, such a poor Man is a Swearer, such a rich
<PB N="181" REF="197"/>
Man a Blasphemer, such a Tradesman is a Cheat▪
such a Justice of the Peace is an Atheist, such a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>akish Fellow is turn'd Highwayman, such a
Beau is debauch'd; But I! I that am cloath'd
in Negatives, and walk in the Light of my own
Vanity, I live a sober, regular, retir'd Life, I am
an honest Man: <HI>Vide Page▪</HI> I defraud no body,
no Man ever heard me swear, or an ill Word
come out of my Mouth; I never talk irreligiously
or prophanely, and I am never miss'd out of my
Seat at Church. God I thank thee! I am not
debauch'd, I am no Highwayman, no Murderer,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now, what's the Difference of all these? I
must confess, speaking of all these together, and
of what is usually the End of them, I think a
Man had better be any of them, nay, almost all
of them together, <HI>than the Man himself;</HI> and my
Reason is, in a few Words, as follows:</P>
<P>All these know themselves to be wicked Per∣sons;
Conscience, tho' for a Time oppress'd and
kept under, yet upon all Occasions tells them
plainly what their Condition is, and oftentimes
they repent. 'Tis true, sometimes they do not,
God is pleas'd sometimes to treat them in the
vindictive Attribute, and they are cut off in their
Crimes, insensible and stupid, without a Space or
a Heart to repent; and therefore, let none take
Hope in their profligate Living, from what I am
going to say.</P>
<P>Again; others, tho' they do repent, and God
is pleas'd to give them the Grace to return to
him as Penitents, come to it very late, and some∣times
under a severe Hand, as perhaps on a
Death-Bed, or under some Disaster, and often∣times
at the <HI>Gallows.</HI></P>
<P>But still I say, those Men tho' they sin, they do
it as a Crime, and when they come to be told
<PB N="182" REF="198"/>
of it often, they are brought repent: But the
Negative Christian I speak of, is full so of him∣self,
so perswaded, that he is good enough, and
religious enough already, that he has no Thoughts
of any thing, unless it be to pull off his Hat to God
Almighty now and then, and thank him, that he
has no Need of him; this is the Opiat that
doses his Soul even to the last Gasp; and it
is ten thousand to one, but the Lethargic Dream
shoots him thro' the Gulph at once, and he never
opens his Eyes till he arrives in that Light, where
all things are naked and open; where he sees
too late, that he has been a Cheat to himself, and
has been hurry'd by his own Pride in a Cloud of
Negatives, into a State of positive Destruction,
without Remedy.</P>
<P>I am reading no particular Man's Fate; God
forbid! I restrain it to no Circumstances, I point
out no Persons; 'tis too solemn a thing to make
it a Satyr; 'tis the State, not the Man, I speak
of; let the guilty apply it to themselves, and the
proud good Man humble himself, and avoid it.</P>
<P>I have observ'd, that many fall into this Case
by the excessive Vanity of being thought well of
by their Neighbours, obtaining a Character, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 'tis
a Delusion very fatal to many; a good Name, is
indeed a precious Ointment, and in some Cases
is better than Life: But with your Pardon, Mr.
<HI>Negative,</HI> it must be a good Name for good Deeds,
or otherwise, a good Name upon a bad Life is <HI>a
painted Where,</HI> that has a gay Countenance upon a
rotten, diseased, corrupted Carcass.</P>
<P>Much to be preferr'd is the general Slander of a
prejudic'd Age, and a State of universal Calumny,
where the Mind is free from the Guilt they charge:
Such a Man, tho' the World spits upon and despi∣ses
<PB N="183" REF="199"/>
him, looks in with Comfort, and looks up
with Hope.</P>
<Q><L>—Hic murus Aheneus esto,</L>
<L>Nil conscire sibi, nulla pallescere culpa.</L>
<L>Virg.</L></Q>
<P>General Contempt, universal Reproach, is a
Life that requires a world of Courage and
Steadiness of Mind to support: But, be this
my Portion in this World, with a Heart that does
not reproach me with the Guilt, much rather
than to be a Man of Negatives only, and who all
the World caresses with their good Wishes, and
good Opinion, but is himself empty of real Vir∣tue,
a Hypocrite at Bottom, a Cheat, and under
the Delusion of it; whose Portion is with Hypo∣crites,
and who can neither look in, or look up
with Pleasure, but must look without himself, for
all that can be call'd Good, either by others, or
by himself.</P>
<P>As at the Great and Last Day, the Secrets of
all Hearts shall be disclosed, so I am perswaded,
the Opinion we have of one another here, will be
one of the Things which will be there, and per∣haps
not till then fully rectify'd; and as we shall
be there thorowly enlightened, we shall find Room
to see, that we have been much mistaken in our No∣tions
of Virtue and Vice, Religion and Irreligion,
in the Characters of our Neighbours. And I am
perswaded, we shall see many of our Acquaintan∣ces
placed at the Right-hand of a righteous Judge,
whose Characters we have oppressed with Slanders,
and who we have censoriously placed at his Left-hand
here: And many a painted Hypocrite, who
has insulted his Neighbour with, <HI>Stand off, I am
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olier than thou,</HI> or whom he has turned from
<PB N="184" REF="200"/>
with Disdain, and with a <HI>This Publican!</HI> plac'd at
the Left-hand, who we made no Doubt we should
have seen at the Right-hand in Triumph.</P>
<P>This is a Support to the Mind of a good Man,
even when his Enemies, as <HI>David says, gnash upon
him with their Teeth,</HI> and <HI>have him in Derision,</HI>
that is to say, when he is run down by universal
Clamour, and damn'd by the Tongues of Men,
even for this World and another.</P>
<Q><L>Happy the Man, who with exalted Soul,</L>
<L>Knows how to rate the great the prosp'rous Fool,</L>
<L>Who can the Ins<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lts of the Street contemn,</L>
<L>And values not the Rage or Tongues of Men?</L>
<L>He like the Sun exists on his own Flame,</L>
<L>And when he dies, is to himself <HI>a Fame.</HI></L></Q>
<P>But take this with you as you go, that as nega∣tive
Praise will build no Man Comfort, so nega∣tive
Virtue will not support the Mind under uni∣versal
Contempt. <HI>Scandal</HI> is much worse than
<HI>Slander;</HI> for the first is founded upon real Guilt,
the other attacks Innocence. Nothing is a Scan∣dal,
but what <HI>is true:</HI> Nothing is a Slander, but
what is <HI>false.</HI></P>
<P>He that fortifies himself against Reproach, must
do it with a certain Reserve of Real, and solid Vir∣tue,
and Piety; it must be Uprightness and Inte∣grity
that must preserve him; nothing but a Fund
of what is good can support the Mind under the
Reproach of being all that is bad; I do not mean
neither, that the Man must be perfect, have no
Follies or Failings, have made no Excursions, have
nothing to be laid to the Charge of his Character;
for where then shall the Man be found I am spea∣king
of? And I may be said to be describing the
<PB N="185" REF="201"/>
Black-swan, a Person that is not, and never was
to be found: But the right Way of judging Men,
and the Way which alone can be just, is to judge
of them by their general Conduct; and so a Man
may in his own Mind justly denominate himself:
As every<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> good Action does not denominate me
to be a good Man, so neither does every Failing,
every Folly, no nor every scandalous Action, de∣nominate
me a Hypocrite, or a wicked Man;
otherwise, some of the most eminent Saints in Scrip∣ture,
and of every Age since the Scripture was
written, are gone to the Devil; and 'twill be
hard to say, there was ever a good Man in the
World.</P>
<P>But I return to my Subject, the negative good
Man; and let me examine him a little in his just
Character, in his Conduct, publick and private:
He is no Drunkard, but is intoxicated with the
Pride of his own Worth: He is a good Neigh∣bour,
a common Arbitrator and Peace-maker in
other Families, but a cursed Tyrant in his own:
He appears in a publick Place of Worship for a
Show, but never enters into his Closet and shuts
the Door about him, to pray to him that sees in
Secret: He is covered with the vain-glorious,
and ostentatious Part of Charity, but does all his
Alms before Men, <HI>to be seen of them:</HI> He is migh∣ty
eager in the Duties of the second Table, but re∣gardless
of the first; appearingly religious to be
seen and taken Notice of by Men; but between
God and his own Soul, no Entercourse, no Com∣munication:
What is this Man? And what Com∣fort
is there of the Life he lives? He knows lit∣tle,
or perhaps nothing of Faith, Repentance, and
a Christian mortified Life: In a Word, he is a
Man perfect in the Circumstances of Religion,
<PB N="186" REF="202"/>
and perfectly a Stranger to the essential Part of
Religion.</P>
<P>Take this Man's Conversation apart, enter into
the private and retir'd Part of it, What Notions
has he of mispent Hours, and of the natural Re∣flux
of all our Minutes, on to the great Center and
Gulph of Life, <HI>Eternity?</HI> Does he know how to
put a right Value upon <HI>Time?</HI> Does he esteem it
<HI>the Life-Blood of his Soul,</HI> as it really is, and act
in all the Moments of it, as one that must ac∣count
for them? Alas! this is of no Weight with
such a Man; he is too full of himself to enter in∣to
any Notions about an Account, either for mi∣spent
Time, or any thing else misdone; but per∣swading
himself, that he never did any thing amiss,
entertains no Notion of Judgment to come, Eter∣nity,
or any thing in it.</P>
<P>What Room has a Man to expatiate in
his Thoughts upon so immense and inconceivable
a Subject, as that of eternal Duration, whose
Thoughts are all taken up, and swell'd Top-full
with his own extraordinary self. It would be im∣possible
for any Man in the World to entertain one
proud Thought of himself, if he had but one
right Idea of a future State. Could such a Man
think, that any thing in him, or any thing he could
do, could purchase for him, a Felicity that was
to last to Eternity? What! that a Man should be ca∣pable
in one Moment (for Life is not that in Length
compar'd to Eternity) to do any thing for which he
should deserve to be made happy to Eternity?</P>
<P>If then you can form no Equality between what
he can do, and what he shall receive; less can it be
founded upon his negative Virtue, or what he has
forborn to do; and if neither his negative nor his
positive Piety can be equal to the Reward, and to
the Eternity that Reward is to last for; Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="187" REF="203"/>
then is become of the Pharisee? he must think no
more of himself, for all his Boasts; neither of his
Negatives nor his Positives, but of a rich unboun∣ded
Grace, that rewards according to itself, not
according to what we can do; and that to be
judged at the last Day according to our Works,
if literally understood, would be to be undone;
but we are to be judged by the Sincerity of our
Repentance, be rewarded according to the infi∣nite
Grace of God, and Purchase of Christ,
with a State of Blessedness to an endless Eter∣nity.</P>
<P>Indeed this Eternity is not a Meditation suita∣ble
to the Man I am talking of, 'tis a sublime
Thought, which his bloated Imagination has never
descended to, or engag'd in; and when it comes,
he is like to have as little Comfort of it, as he has
had Thought about it.</P>
<P>This Thought of Eternity raises new Ideas in
my Mind, and I cannot go forward without a
Digression upon so important a Subject; if the
Reader approves the Thought, he will not quar∣rel
about its being a Digression.</P>

</LG>
<P>But to the Purpose in Hand; for I have not
done with this Man of Negatives yet: And now
let us bring him more nearly and seriously to a
Converse with the invisible World: He looks in∣to
it with Horror and dreadful Apprehensions; as
<HI>Foelix,</HI> when St. <HI>Paul</HI> reasoned of Temperance, Righ∣teousness,
and of Judgment to come. <HI>Foelix,</HI> was
<PB N="191" REF="207"/>
a moral Heathen, that is to say, a Man of Nega∣tives,
like him I am speaking of. What was
then the Case? he trembl'd; Pray, what is it rea∣sonable
to think <HI>Foelix</HI> trembled at? if I may give
my Opinion, who am but a very mean Expositor
of Texts, it was this or something like it.</P>
<P><HI>Foelix</HI> was a Philosopher, as well as a Man of
Power; and by his Wisdom, as also by his Reve∣rence
of the Gods, which at that Time was the
Sum of Religion, had been a Man of Morals, a
Man that had practic'd Temperance and Righte∣ousness,
as the Life which was unquestionably to
be rewarded by the Powers above, with an Ely∣sian
Felicity; that is to say, according to the <HI>Ro∣man</HI>
Maxim, That the Gods were the Rewarders
of Virtue.</P>
<P>But when the blessed Apostle came to reason
with <HI>Foelix,</HI> how unlikely it was, that these Ne∣gatives
should purchase our Happiness hereafter,
he shew'd him, that the Gods could not be in Debt
to us for the Practice of Virtue, which was indeed no
more than living most suitable to our Reason,
that a Life of Virtue and Temperance was its own
Reward, by giving a healthy Body, a clear Head,
a compos'd Life, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> fitting the Man for all
other worldly Enjoyments, adequate to his Rea∣son,
and his present Felicity as a Man: But
eternal Happiness must come from another Spring,
namely from the infinite unbounded Grace of a
provok'd God, who having erected a righteous
Tribunal, where every Heart should be searched,
and where every Tongue would confess itself guil∣ty,
and stand self-condemn'd. Jesus Christ, whom
<HI>Paul</HI> preach'd, would separate such as by Faith and
Repentance he had brought home, and united to
himself by the Grace of Adoption, and on the
<PB N="192" REF="208"/>
Foot of his having laid down his Life a Ransom
for them, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad appointed them to Salvation.</P>
<P>When poor Negative <HI>Foelix</HI> heard of this, and
that all his Philosophy, his Temperance, and
Righteousness, if it had been ten thousand Times
as great, could weigh nothing, and plead nothing
for him at that Judicature; and that he began to
see the Justice and Reason of this; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or <HI>Paul</HI> rea∣soned
him into it; I say, when he saw this, he
trembl'd indeed, as well he might, and as all ne∣gative
People will.</P>
<P>What a strange Idea must that Pharisee have of
God, who went up with the Publican to the Tem∣ple
to pray: 'Tis observable, he went with a good
Stock of Assurance in his Face, that could come to
the Altar, as he did, not to offer any Sacrifice; we
don't find he carry'd any Offering, or bespoke
the Priest to make any Attonement; he wanted no
Priests to make any Confession to: Good Man, as
he thought he was, he had no Sins to confess;
he rather came up to the Altar to even Accounts
with Heaven; and like the other Man in the Gos∣pel,
tell God, that he had fulfill'd the whole Law,
and had done all those things that were command∣ed,
even from his Youth; so, as before, he only pul∣led
off his Hat to his God, and let him know,
that there was nothing between them at present,
and away he goes about his Business.</P>
<P>But the poor Wretch, whom he despis'd, and
whom he had left behind him, for he durst come no
farther, acted quite another Part. He had at first
indeed, in Sence of his Duty, resolv'd to go up to
the Temple; But when he saw the Splendor and
Majesty of God represented by the Glory of that
elevated Building; I say, when he saw that, tho'
a great Way off,, and then look'd into his own
Heart, all his negative Confidences failing him,
<PB N="193" REF="209"/>
and a Sense of miserable Circumstances coming
upon him, he stops short, and with a Blow of Re∣flection
and perfectly unmixt with any of the Pha∣risees
Pride, he looks down in Humility, but lifts
up his Heart in a penitential Faith, with a <HI>Lord be
merciful to me a Sinner.</HI></P>
<P>Here was Faith, Repentance, Duty, and Con∣fession,
all conjoin'd in one Act, and the Man's
Work was done at once, <HI>he went away justified;</HI>
when the negative Pharisee went home, the same∣self
vain Wretch, that he came out with <HI>God I
thank thee</HI> in his Mouth, and a M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ss of Pride in
his Heart, that nothing could convince.</P>
<P>In what glorious Colours do the Scriptures up∣on
all Occasions represent those two <HI>Hand in Hand</HI>
Graces, <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Repentance?</HI> There is not one
Mention of Faith in the whole Scripture, but
what is recommending some Way or other to our
Admiration, and to our Practice; 'tis the Foun∣dation
and the Top-stone of all Religion, the
Right-hand to lead, and the Left-hand to support,
in the whole Journey of a Christian, even thro' this
World, and into the next: In a Word, 'tis the
S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m and Substance of the Gospel Foundation.</P>
<P>Religion seems to have been founded upon three
Establishments in the World; in all which the
Terms of Life are laid down at the End of our
Acceptance of it.</P>
<P>The First Establishment was with <HI>Adam</HI> in <HI>Pa∣radise;</HI>
the Terms of which were, FORBEAR <HI>and
Live.</HI></P>
<P>The Second Establishment was with the Chil∣dren
of <HI>Israel,</HI> in the giving of the Law; the Terms
of which were, Do <HI>and Live.</HI></P>
<P>The Third Establishment is that of the Gospel
of Jesus Christ; the Terms of which are, BELIEVE
<HI>and Liv</HI></P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="210"/>
So that in a Word, Faith is the Substance
and Fulfilling of Gospel Religion, the Plan of
Righteousness, and the great Efficient of eter∣nal
Life. Let me break out here upon this glo∣rious

If all this be to be said, and all indeed but a Poe∣tical
Trifle upon this exalted Subject, What is be∣come
of our Negative Christian in all this? There
is not a Word of Negative Religion in all the De∣scription
of Faith, any more than there is of Faith
in all our Negative Religion.</P>
<P>Now let us follow this poor Negative Wretch to
his Death-bed, and there having very little other
Notion of Religion; for 'tis the Fate of those
that trust to their Negatives, to have little else in
their Thoughts: If a good Man come to talk with
him, if he talks out of that Way, he puts him all
into Confusion; for if he cannot swim upon the
Bladders of his Negatives, he drowns immediate∣ly,
or he bouys himself up above your Reproofs,
and goes on as before: He is a little like the <HI>Po∣lish</HI>
Captain <HI>Uratz,</HI> who was executed for the Mur∣ther
of Mr. <HI>Thynne,</HI> who, when they talk't to him
of Repentance, and of Jesus Christ, said, he was
of such and such a Family, and he hop'd God would
have some Respect to him as a Gentleman.</P>
<P>But what must a poor Minister do, who being
fill'd with better Principles, prays for this vain
glorious Man? Must he say, Lord accept this
good Man, for he has been no Drunkard, no Swea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er,
no debauch'd Person; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he has been a just, a
charitable Man, has done a great deal of Good
among his Neighbours, and never wilfully wrong'd
any Man; he has not been so wicked as it is the
Custom of the Times to be; nor has he shewn
bad Examples to others; Lord be merciful to this
excellent good Man?</P>
<P>No, no, the poor sincere Miuister knows better
things; and if he prays with him, he turns him
quite in-side-out, represents him as a poor mista∣ken
Creature, who now sees, that he is nothing,
<PB N="203" REF="219"/>
and has nothing in himself, but casts himself en∣tirely,
as a miserable lost Sinner, into the Arms
of a most merc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ful Saviour, praying to be accep∣ted

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>E are naturally backward to inform
our selves of our Duty to our Ma∣ker,
and to our selves; 'tis a Study
we engage in with great Reluctance,
and 'tis but too agreeable to us,
when we meet with any Difficulty
which we think gives us a just Occasion to throw
off any farther Enquiries of that kind.</P>
<P>Hence I observe the wisest of Men often run
into Mistakes about the Things, which speaking
of Religion we call <HI>Duty,</HI> taking up slight Notions
of them, and believing they understand enough of
them; by which they rob themselves of the Ad∣vantage,
as well as Comfort of a farther search.
Or on the other hand, taking up with the gene∣ral
Knowledge of religious Princ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ples, and the
common Duties of a Christian Life, are satisfy'd
with knowing what they say is sufficient to carry
them to Heaven, without enquiring into those
Things which are helpful and assistant to make
that strait Path easy and pleasant to themselves;
and to make them useful to others by the
Way.</P>
<P><HI>Solomon</HI> was quite of another Opinion, when
he bid us <HI>cry after Knowledge, and lift up</HI> our <HI>Voice
<PB N="205" REF="221"/>
for Understanding; dig for her as for Silver,</HI> and <HI>search
for her as for hid Treasure.</HI> It is certain here that he
meant religious Knowledge; and it is explained
in the very next Words, with an encouraging Pro∣mise
to those that shall enter upon the Search. (<HI>viz.</HI>)
<HI>Then shalt thou understand the Fear of the LORD,
and find the Knowledge of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>I am of Opinion that it is our unquestioned
Duty, to enquire after every Thing in our Jour∣ney
to the eternal Habitation, which God has
permitted us to know, and thus to raise Difficul∣ties
in the Way of our just search into divine Dis∣coveries
is to act, like <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Sluggard, who saith,
<HI>There is a Lion without, I shall be slain in the Streets,</HI>
Prov. xxii. 13. <HI>that is,</HI> he sits down in his Ignorance
repuls'd with imaginary difficulties, without making
one Step in the search after the Knowledge, which
he ought to <HI>dig for, as for hid Treasure.</HI></P>
<P>Let us then be encourag'd to our Duty; let us
boldly enquire after every Thing that God has
permitted us to know; I grant that secret Things
belong to God, and I shall labour to keep my due
Distance. But I firmly believe, that there are no
secret Things belonging to God, and which
as such we are forbidden to enquire into, but what
also are so preserv'd in Secrecy, that by all our
Enquiries we cannot arrive to the Knowledge of
them; and it is a most merciful, as well as wise
Dispensation, that we are only forbid enquiring
after these Things which we cannot know; and
that all those Things are effectually lock'd up from
our Knowledge, which we are forbidden to en∣quire
into. The Case is better with us, than it
was with <HI>Adam.</HI> We have not the Tree of Know∣ledge
first planted in our View, as it were tempt∣ing
us with its Beauty, and within our Reach,
and then a Prohibition upon Pain of Death: But
<PB N="206" REF="222"/>
blessed be God, we may eat of all the Trees in
the Garden; and all those of which we are not
allow'd to take, are plac'd both out of our Sight,
and out of our Reach.</P>
<P>I am making Way here to one of the Trees of
sacred Knowledge, which tho' it may grow in the
thickest of the Wood, and be surrounded with
some Briars and Thorns, so as to place it a little
out of Sight; yet I hope to prove, that it is our
Duty to taste of it: and that the Way to come at
it, is both practicable and plain.</P>
<P>But to wave the Allegory, as I am entring into
the nicest Search of divine things, that perhaps the
whole Scheme of Religion directs us to; 'tis ab∣solutely
necessary at our Entrance, <HI>if possible,</HI> to re∣move
every Difficulty, explain every Principle,
and lay down every Foundation so undeniably
clear, that nothing may appear dark or mysterious
in our first Conceptions of things; no Stumbling∣block
lye at the Threshold, and the humble Rea∣der
may meet with no Repulse from his own Ap∣prehensions,
of not understanding what he is going
to read.</P>
<P><HI>Listening to the Voice of Providence,</HI> is my Subject:
I am willing to suppose in the first Place, that I am
writing to those who acknowledge the two grand
Principles upon which all Religion depends. 1.
That there is a God, a first great moving Cause
of all things, an eternal Power, <HI>Prior,</HI> and conse∣quently
<HI>Superior</HI> to all Power and Being. 2. That
this eternal Power, which I call God, is the Crea∣tor
and Governour of all things, <HI>viz.</HI> of Heaven
and Earth.</P>
<P>To avoid needless Distinctions concerning which
of the Persons in the God-head, are exercised in the
creating Power, and which in the governing Power.
I offer that glorious Text, <HI>Psalm</HI> xxxiii. 6 as a
<PB N="207" REF="223"/>
Repulse to all such <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avilling Enquiries, where the
whole Trinity is plainly entitled to the whole
creating Work, by the WORD (<HI>God the Son</HI>) of the
LORD (<HI>God the Father</HI>) were the Heavens made,
and all the Host of them, by the BREATH (<HI>God the
Holy Ghost</HI>) of his Mouth.</P>
<P>Having thus presupposed the Belief of the Being,
and the creating Work of God, and declar'd, that
I am writing to such only, who are ready to own,
they believe that <HI>God is,</HI> and that he created the
Heaven, and the Earth, the Sea, and all that in
them is. I think I need not make any Preamble,
to introduce the following Propositions, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>1. That this Eternal God guides by his Provi∣dence
the whole World, which he has created by his
Power.</P>
<P>2. That this Providence manifests a particular Care
over, and Concern in the governing and directing Man,
the best and last created Creature on Earth.</P>
<P><HI>Natural Religion</HI> proves the first, reveal'd Reli∣gion
proves the last of these beyond Contradiction.
<HI>Natural Religion</HI> intimates the Necessity of a Pro∣vidence
guiding and governing the World, from
the Consequence of the Wisdom, Justice, Pre∣science,
and Goodness of the Creator.</P>
<P>It would be absurd to conceive of God exer∣ting
infinite Power to create a World, and not
concerning his Wisdom, which is his Providence,
in guiding the Operations of Nature, so as to pre∣serve
the Order of his Creation, and the Obedi∣ence
and Subordination of Consequences and Cau∣ses
throughout the Course of that Nature,
which is in Part the inferior Life of that Cre∣ation.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="224"/>
<HI>Reveal'd Religion</HI> has given such a Light into the
Care and Concern of this Providence in an espe∣cial
Manner, in and over that Part of the Creation
call'd <HI>Man,</HI> that we must likewise deny Principles,
if we enter into dispute about it.</P>
<P>For him the Peace of the Creation is preserv'd,
the Climates made habitable, the Creatures subje∣cted
and made nourishing, all vegetative Life made
medicinal; so that indeed the whole Creation seems
to be entail'd upon him as an Inheritance, and given
to him for a Possession, subjected to his Authority,
and governed by him, as Viceroy to the King of all
the Earth; the Management of it is given to him as
Tenant to the great Proprietor, who is Lord of
the Mannor, or Landlord of the Soil And it can
not be conceiv'd, without great Inconsistency of
Thought, that this World isle ft entirely to Man's
Conduct without the supervising Influence and
the secret Direction of the Creator.</P>
<P>This I call <HI>Providence,</HI> to which I give the whole
Power of guiding and directing of the Creation,
and managing of it, by Man who is his Deputy
or Substitute, and even the guiding, influencing,
and over-ruling Man himself also.</P>
<P>Let critical Annotators enter into specifick Di∣stinctions
of Providence, and its Way of acting,
as they please, and as the Formalities of the School∣men
direct. The short Description I shall give of
it is this, That it is that Operation of the Pow∣er,
Wisdom, Justice, and Goodness of God, by
which he influences, governs, and directs, not on∣ly
the Means, but the Events of all things, which
concern us in this World.</P>
<P>I say, it is <HI>that Operation,</HI> let them call it what
they will, which acts thus; I am noway concern'd
to shew how it acts, or why it acts thus and thus
in particular; we are to reverence its Sovereignty,
<PB N="209" REF="225"/>
as it is the Finger of God himself, who is the so∣vereign
Director, and we are to observe its Mo∣tions,
obey its Dictates, and <HI>listen to its Voice,</HI> as
it is, and because it is particularly employ'd for
our Advantage.</P>
<P>It would be a very proper and useful Observa∣tion
here, and might take up much of this Work,
to illustrate the Goodness of Providence, in that it
is, <HI>as I say,</HI> particularly employ'd for the Advan∣tage
of Mankind: But, as this is not the main
Design, and will come in naturally in every Part of
the Work I am upon, I refer it to the common In∣ferences,
which are to be drawn from the Particu∣lars,
as I go on.</P>
<P>It is indeed the most rational Foundation of the
whole Design before me; 'tis therefore that we
should <HI>listen to the Voice of Providence,</HI> because it is
principally determin'd, and determines all other
things for our Advantage.</P>
<P>But I return to the main Subject, <HI>The Voice of
Providence,</HI> the Language or the Meaning of Pro∣vidence.</P>
<P>Nothing is more frequent, than for us to mistake
Providence, even in its most visible Appearances;
How easy then must it be, to let its silent Actings,
which perhaps are the most pungent and significant,
pass our Observation.</P>
<P>I am aware of the Error many fall into, who
determining the universal Currency of Events to
Providence, and that not the minutest thing occurs
in the Course of Life, but by the particular Desti∣nation
of Heaven, by Consequence entitle Provi∣dence
to the Efficiency of their own Follies; as
if a Person, presuming to smoke his Pipe in a
Magazin of Gun-Powder, should reproach Provi∣dence
with blowing up the Castle, for which in∣deed
he ought to be hang'd; or a Man leaving his
<PB N="210" REF="226"/>
House or Shop open in the Night, should charge
Providence with appointing him to be robb'd, <HI>and
the like:</HI> Nay, to carry it farther, every Murtherer
or Thief may allege Providence, that determines
and directs every thing, directed him to such Wic∣kedness,
whereas Providence itself, notwithstan∣ding
the Crimes of Men, is actively concern'd in
no Evil.</P>
<P>But I pass all these things; the Subject I am
treating upon, is of another Nature: The Design
here, is to instruct us in some particular things re∣lating
to Providence and its Government of
Men in the World, which it will be worth our
While to observe, without enquiring how far it
does or does not act in other Methods.</P>
<P>There is, 'tis true, a Difficulty to shake off all the
wry Steps, which People take to amuse them∣selves
about Providence; and for this Reason, I
take so much Pains at first to avoid them: Many
Men entitle Providence to things, which it is not
concern'd about, <HI>speaking abstractedly;</HI> but, <HI>which is
a much worse Error,</HI> many also take no Notice of
those things, which Providence particularly, and
even in a very remarkable Manner, distinguishes it
self by <HI>its Concern</HI> in.</P>
<P>If Providence guides the World, and directs the
Issues and Events of things, if it commands causes,
and forms the Connection of Circumstances in the
World, as no Man, that owns the Principles men∣tioned
above, will deny: And above all, if the
general Scope of Providence, and of the Govern∣ment
of the World by its Influence, be for our
Advantage; then it follows necessarily, that it
is our Business, and our Interest, <HI>to listen to its
Voice.</HI></P>
<P>By Listning to the Voice of Providence, I
mean, to study its Meaning in every Circumstance
<PB N="211" REF="227"/>
of Life, in every Event; to learn to understand the
End and Design of Providence in every thing than
happens, what is the Design of Providence in it,
respecting our selves, and what our Duty to do
upon the particular Occasion that offers. I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Man
were in Danger of drowning in a shipwreck'd
Vessel, and Providence presented a Boat coming
towards him, he would scarce want to be told,
that it was his Business to make Signals of Distress,
that the People in the said Boat might not pass
by ignorant of his Condition, and give him no
Assistance; if he did, and omitted it, he would
have little Cause to concern Providence in his
Ruine.</P>
<P>There is certainly a Rebellion against Provi∣dence,
which Heaven itself will not always con∣cern
itself to over-rule; and he that throws him∣self
into a River to drown himself, he that hangs
himself up to a Beam, he that shoots himself into
the Head with a Pistol, shall die in Spite of all
the Notions of Decree, Destiny, Fate, or what
ever we weakly call Providence; in such Cases,
Providence will not always concern itself to pre∣vent
it; and yet 'tis no Impeachment of the So∣vereignty
of Heaven, in directing, decreeing, and
governing all Events in the World.</P>
<P>Providence decrees, that Events shall attend up∣on
Causes in a direct Chain, and by an evident
Necessity, and has doubtless left many Powers of
Good and Evil, seemingly to our selves, and, as
it were, in our Hands, as the natural Product of
such Causes and Consequences, which we are not
to limit, and cannot expressly determine about,
but which we are accountable for the good or evil
Application of; otherwise we were in vain ex∣horted
and commanded to do any good thing, or
to avoid any wicked one: Rewards and Punish∣ments
<PB N="212" REF="228"/>
would be incongruous with sovereign Justice;
and Promises, and Threatnings, be perfectly un∣meaning
useless things, Mankind being no free
Agent to himself, or entrusted with the necessary
Powers, which those Promises and Threatnings
imply.</P>
<P>But all these things are out of my present En∣quiry;
I am for freely and entirely submitting all
Events to Providence; but not to be supinely and
unconcernedly passive, as if there was nothing
warnings, instructing, or directing in the Premoni∣tions
of God's Providence; and which he expe∣cted
we should take Notice of, and take Warning
by. <HI>The prudent Man foreseeth the Evil, and
hideth himself:</HI> How does he foresee it, since 'tis
not in Man to direct himself? There are Intima∣tions
given us, by which a prudent Man may some∣times
foresee Evil, and hide himself; and I must
take these all out of the Devil's Hands, if possi∣ble,
and place Providence at the Head of the in∣visible
World, as well as at the Helm of this
World; and tho' I abhor superstitious and scepti∣cal
Notions of the World of Spirits, of which
I purpose to speak hereafter, either in this Work,
or in some other by itself; I say, tho' I am not at
all a Sceptick, yet I cannot doubt, but that the
invisible Hand of Providence, which guides and
governs this World, does with a secret Power like∣wise
influence the World, and may, and I believe
does, direct from thence silent Messengers on many
Occasions, whether sleeping or waking, whether
directly or indirectly, whether by Hints, Impul∣ses,
Allegories, Mysteries, or otherwise, we know
not; and does think fit to give us such Alarms, such
previous and particular Knowledge of things,
that it listen'd to, might many Ways be useful to
<PB N="213" REF="229"/>
the prudent Man to foresee the Evil, and hide
himself.</P>
<P>The only Objection, and which I can see no
Method to give a Reason for, and no Answer to,
is, Why, if it be the Work of Providence, those
things should be so imperfect, so broken, so irre∣gular,
that Men may either never be able to pass
any right Judgment of them, as is sometimes the
Case, or make a perfect Judgment of them, which
is often the Case, and so the End of the Intima∣tion
be entirely defeated, without any Fault, Ne∣glect,
or Omission of the Man.</P>
<P>This we can no more account for, than we
can for the Hand-writing upon the Wall at the
great Feast of <HI>Belshazzer, viz.</HI> why it was writ∣ten
in a Character, which none could understand;
and which, if the Prophet had not been-found,
had perhaps never been known, or at least, not till
the King's Fate, which was even then irretrieva∣ble,
had been over.</P>
<P>This, indeed, we cannot account for, and can
only say, 'tis our Duty to study these things, to listen
to the Voice of them, and obey their secret Di∣ctates,
as far as Reason directs, without an over
superstitious Regard to them, any more than a
total Neglect, leaving the Reason of Providence's
acting thus, to be better understood hereafter.</P>
<P>But to describe a little what I mean by Listen∣ing
to the Voice of Providence; it is the Reverse
of the supine stupid Man, whose Character I shall
come to by and by. The Man I would recom∣mend,
lives first in a general Belief, that Provi∣dence
has the supreme Direction of all his Affairs,
even of his in particular, as well as those of the
World; that 'tis his Mercy that it is so, that 'tis
the Effect of an infinitely wise and gracious Dispo∣sition
from above, that he subsists; and that 'tis
<PB N="214" REF="230"/>
not below the Dignity any more than 'tis remote
from the Power of an infinite, wise, and good
Being, to take Cognizance of the least thing con∣cerning
him.</P>
<P>This in the Consequence obliges him to all I
say, for to him who firmly believes, that Provi∣dence
stoops to concern itself for him, and to or∣der
the least Article of his Affairs, it necessarily
follows, that he should concern himself in every
thing that Providence does, <HI>which comes within his
Reach,</HI> that he may know whether he be interested
in it or no.</P>
<P>If he neglects this, he neglects himself; he a∣bandons
all Concern about himself, since he does
not know, but that the very next particular Act of
Providence, which comes within his Reach to
distinguish, may be interested in him, and he
in it.</P>
<P>It is not for me to dictate here to any Man,
what particular things, relating to him, Providence
is concern'd in, or what not; or how far any In∣cident
of Life is or is not the particular Act and
Deed of the Government of Providence: But as
it is the receiv'd Opinion of every good Man, that
nothing befalls us without the active or passive
Concern of Providence in it; so it is impossible
this good Man can be unconcern'd in what∣ever
that Providence determines concerning
him.</P>
<P>If it be true, as our Saviour himself says, <HI>That
not a Hair falls from our Heads without the Will of
our heavenly Father,</HI> then not a Hair ought to fall
from our Heads, without our having our Eyes up
to our heavenly Father in it.</P>
<P>I take the Text in its due Latitude, namely,
that not the minutest Incident of Life, befalls us
without the active Will of our Father directing it,
<PB N="215" REF="231"/>
or the passive Will of our Father suffering it, so
I take the Deduction from it in the same Latitude;
that nothing of how mean a Nature soever can
befal us, but we ought to have our Eyes up to
our heavenly Father in it, be resign'd to him in
the Event, and subjected to him in the Means;
and he that neglects this, lives in Contempt of
Providence, and that in the most provoking Man∣ner
possible.</P>
<P>I am not answerable for any Extremes these
Things may lead weak People into; I know some
are apt to entitle the Hand of God, to the com∣mon
and most ridiculous Trifles in Nature;
as a religious Creature, I knew, seeing a Bot∣tle
of Beer being over ripe burst out, the Cork fly
up against the Ceiling, and the Froth follow it like
an Engin, cried out, <HI>O! the Wonders of Omnipo∣tent
Power:</HI> But I am representing, how a Christian
with an awful Regard to the Government of Provi∣dence
in the World, and particularly in all his own
Affairs, subjects his Mind to a constant Obedience
to the Dictates of that Providence, gives an humble
Preference to it in all his Conclusions, waits the
Issues of it with a chearful Resignation; and in a
Word listens carefully to the Voice of Providence,
that he may be always obedient to the heavenly
Vision.</P>
<P>Whether this divine Emanation has any Con∣cern
in the Notices, Omens, Dreams, Voices,
Hints, Forebodings, Impulses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which seem
to be a kind of Communication with the invi∣sible
World, and a Converse between the Spi∣rits
embodied and those unembodied, and how
far without Prejudice to the Honour and our Reve∣rence
of Providence, and without Danger of
Scepticism, and a kind of radicated Infidelity,
those Things may be regarded, is a nice and dif∣ficult
<PB N="116" REF="232"/>
Thing to resolve, and I shall treat of it by
it self.</P>
<P>It has been the Opinion of good Men of all
Ages, to say how far they are to be depend∣ed
upon, that such Things are not to be to∣tally
disregarded, I am not to take upon me,
How far they may or may not be concerned in the
Influence of Providence, I also dare not say: But as
the Verity of Astronomy is evidenced by the
Calculation of Eclipses, so the Certainty of this
Communication of Spirits is established by the
Concurrence of Events with the Notices they
sometimes give; and if it be true, as I must be∣lieve,
that the Divine Providence takes Cognisance
of all Things belonging to us, I dare not exclude
it from having some Concern, <HI>how much I do not say,</HI>
in these Things also: But of this in its Place.</P>
<P>Whenever Providence discovers any thing of this
<HI>Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anum,</HI> I desire to listen to the Voice of it; and
this is one of the Things I recommend to others:
Indeed I would be very cautious, how I listen to
any other Voices from that Country, than such as I
am sure are conveyed to me from Heaven for my
better understanding the whole Mystery.</P>
<P>If then we are to listen to the Voice of Nature, and
to the Voices of Creatures, <HI>viz.</HI> to the Voice of the
invisible Agents of the World of Spirits as above,
much more are we to listen to the Voice of God.</P>
<P>I have already hinted that he that made the
World, <HI>we are sure</HI> guides it, and his Provi∣dence
is equally wonderful as his Power: But no∣thing
in the whole Course of his Providence is
more worthy our Regard, especially as it con∣cerns
us his Creatures, than the silent Voice, <HI>if it
may be allowed me to call it so,</HI> of his managing
Events and Causes; he that listens to the Provi∣dence
of God, listens to the Voice of God,
<PB N="217" REF="233"/>
as he is seen in the Wonders of his Government,
and as he is seen in the Wonders of his Omni∣potence.</P>
<P>If then the Events of Things are his, as well
as the Causes, it is certainly well worth our
Notice, when the Sympathy or Relation between
Events of Things and their Causes, most emi∣nently
appears; and how can any Man, who has
the least Inclination to observe what is remarka∣ble
in the World, shut his Eyes to the visible
Discovery, which there is in the Events of
Providence, of a supreme Hand guiding them;
for Example, when visible Punishments follow vi∣sible
Crimes, who can refrain confessing the appa∣rent
Direction of supreme Justice? When Concur∣rence
of Circumstances directs to the Cause,
Men that take no Notice of such remarkable
Pointings of Providence, openly contemn Hea∣ven,
and frequently stand in the Light of their
own Advantages.</P>
<P>The Concurrence of Events, is a Light to
their Causes, and the Methods of Heaven in
some Things, are a happy Guide to us to make a
Judgment in others; he that is deaf to these
Things, shuts his Ears to Instruction, and like
<HI>Solomon</HI>'s Fool, <HI>hates Knowledge.</HI></P>
<P>The Dispositions of Heaven to approve or con∣demn
our Actions, are many of them discovered
by Observation; and 'tis easy to know, when that
Hand of Providence opens the Door for, or
shuts it against our Measures, if we will bring
Causes together, and compare former Things
with present, making our Judgment by the ordinary
Rules of Heaven's dealing with Men.</P>
<P>How, and from what Hand come the frequent
Instances of severe Judgment, following rash and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ellish Imprecations? when Men call for God's
<PB N="218" REF="234"/>
Judgment; and Providence, or Justice, rather
obeys the Summons and comes at their call: A
Man calls God to Witness to an Untruth, and
wishes himself struck dumb; blind, or dead if it
is not true; and is struck dumb; blind, or dead;
is not this a Voice, does not Heaven with the
Stroke, cry, <HI>Castigo te, Be it to thee as thou hast
said:</HI> He must be deaf who cannot hear i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and
worse than deaf that does not heed it; such Exe∣cutions
from Heaven are <HI>in Terrorem,</HI> as Offenders
among Men are punished as well for Example to
others, as to prevent their doing the like again.</P>
<P>Innumerable Ways the merciful Disposition of
Providence takes to discover to us, what he ex∣pects
we should do in difficult Cases, and doubtless
then, it expects at the same Time we should take
Notice of those Directions.</P>
<P>We are short-sighted Creatures at best, and can
see but a little Way before us, I mean as to the E∣vents
of Things; we ought therefore to make use
of all the Lights and Helps we can get; these if
nicely regarded, would be some of the most con∣siderable
to guide us in many difficult Cases.</P>
<P>Would we carefully listen to the Concurrence
of Providence, in the several Parts of our Lives,
we should stand in less need of the more dange∣rous
Helps of Visions, Dreams, and Voices,
from less certain Intelligences.</P>
<P>A Gentleman of my Acquaintance, being to
go a Journey into the North, was twice ta∣ken
very ill the Day he had appointed to begin his
Journey, and so was oblig'd to put off going; this he
took for a Direction from Heaven, that he should
not go at all; and in very few Days after, his Wife
was taken sick and died, which made it absolutely
necessary for him, to be at Home, to look after
<PB N="219" REF="235"/>
his Affairs, and had he gone away before, must
certainly have been obliged to come back again.</P>
<P>The <HI>Romans</HI> had certainly the Foundation of
this Principle, in their prudent Observation of
Days and Circumstances of Days; nor is Scrip∣ture
it self void of the like, but rather points out
to the Observation, particularly that of the Chil∣dren
of <HI>Israel,</HI> who after 430 Years were expired
from their coming into <HI>Egypt, Even in the self∣same
Day departed they thence,</HI> Exod. 12, 41, 42.
This is the Day, that remarkable Day, several
other Scriptures mention periodical Times, <HI>dies
Infaustus,</HI> the Prudent shall keep Silence in that
Time; for it is <HI>an evil Time.</HI></P>
<P>We find Providence stoops to restrain not the A∣ctions
of Men only, but even its own Actions to Days
and Times; doubtless for our Observation, and in
some Things for our Instruction; I do not
so much refer to the Revolutions of Things and
Families on particular Days, which are there∣fore
by some People called lucky and unlucky
Days, as I do to the observing, how Providence
causes the Revolutions of Days, to form a
Concurrence between the Actions of Men, which
it does not approve or does approve, and the Re∣ward
of these Actions in this World; by which
Men may if they think fit to distinguish, and ob∣serve
right upon them, see the Crime or Merit
of those Actions in the divine Resentment, may
read the Sin in the Punishment, and may learn
Conviction from the Revolution of Circumstances
in the Appointment of Heaven.</P>
<P>I have seen several Collections of such Things
made by private Hands, some relating to Family
Circumstances, some to Public; also in the unnatural
Wars in <HI>England,</HI> between the King and the Parlia∣ment,
I have heard many such things have been ob∣erv'd:
<PB N="220" REF="236"/>
For Example, the same Day of the Year
and Month, that Sir <HI>John Hotham</HI> kept out <HI>Hull</HI> a∣gainst
King <HI>Charles</HI> the 1st, and refused him En∣trance,
was the same Sir <HI>John Hotham</HI> put to
Death, by the very Parliament that he did that
Exploit for; that King <HI>Charles</HI> himself was
sentenced to die, by the high Court of Justice, as
it was then called, the same Day of the Month,
that he sign'd the Warrant for the Execution of
the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> which as it was then said by
some of his Friends, was cutting off his own
Right-hand. The same Day that King <HI>James</HI>
the 2d came to the Crown against the Design of
the Bill of Exclusion, the same Day he was voted
Abdicated by Parliament, and the Throne fill'd
with the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> and his Princess.</P>
<P>These, or such as these, seem to be a kind of
silent Sentence of Providence upon such Actions,
animadverting upon them in a judicial Manner,
and intimating plainly, that the Animadversion
had a retrospect to what was passed, and those
that listen to the Voice of Providence in such
Things, should at least lay them up in their
Hearts.</P>
<P>Eminent Deliverances in sudden Dangers are of
the most significant kind of Providences, and
which accordingly have a loud Voice in them,
calling upon us to be thankful, to that blessed
Hand, that has been pleased to spare and protect
us. The Voice of such signal Deliverances, is
frequently a just Call upon us to Repentance
and looks directly that Way; often 'tis a Caution
against falling into the like Dangers we were ex∣posed
to, from which nothing but so much Good∣ness
could deliver us again. In how many Occa∣sions
of Life, if God's Providence had no greater
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in our Safety than our own Prudence,
<PB N="221" REF="237"/>
should we plunge and precipitate our selves into
all manner of Misery and Distress? and how of∣ten
for want of listening to those Providences do
we miscarry?</P>
<P>Innumerable Instances present themselves to us
every Day, in which the Providence of God speaks
to us, in Things relating to ourselves; in Delive∣rances
to excite our Thankfulness, in Views of
Dangers to awaken our Caution, and to make us
walk wisely and circumspectly in every Step we
take; those that are awake to these Things, and
have their Ears open to the Voice of them, many
Times reap the Benefit of their Instruction by
being protected, while those who neglect them,
are of the Number of the Simple, who pass on
and are punished.</P>
<P>To be utterly careless of ourselves in such Cases,
and talk of trusting Providence, is a Lethargy of
the worst Nature; for as we are to trust Provi∣dence
with our Estates, but to use at the same
Time, all Diligence in our Callings; so we
are to trust Providence with our Safety, but
with our Eyes open to all its necessary Cautions,
Warnings, and Instructions; many of which Provi∣dence
is pleased to give us in the Course of Life, for
the Direction of our Conduct, and which we should
ill place to the Account of Providence, without ac∣knowledging
that they ought to be regarded, and
a due Reverence paid to them upon all Occasions.</P>
<P>I take a general Neglect of these Things, to
be a kind of practical Atheism, or at least a living
in a kind of Contempt of Heaven, regardless of
all that Share, which his invisible Hand has in the
Things that befal us.</P>
<P>Such a Man receives good at the Hand of his
Maker, but unconcerned at the very Nature or
Original of it, looks not at all to the Benefactor:
<PB N="222" REF="238"/>
Again, he receives Evil, but has no Sense of it, as
a judicial dispensing of Punishment from Heaven;
but insensible of one or other, he is neither thank∣ful
for one, not humble under the other, but stupid
in both, as if he was out of God's Care, and God
himself out of his Thoughts; this is just the re∣verse
of the Temper I am recommending, and let
the Picture recommend it self to any according to
its Merit.</P>
<P>When Prince <HI>Vandemont</HI> commanded the confe∣derate
Army in <HI>Flanders,</HI> the same Campaign that
King <HI>William</HI> was beseiging <HI>Namure,</HI> some Troops
were order'd to march into the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at Country to∣wards
<HI>Newport,</HI> in Order to make a Diversion,
and draw down the Count <HI>de Montal,</HI> who com∣manded
a flying Body about <HI>Menin,</HI> and to keep
him from joyning the Duke <HI>de Villeroy,</HI> who com∣manded
the main Body of the <HI>French</HI> Army.</P>
<P>The Soldiers were order'd upon Pain of Death
not to stir from their Camp, or to plunder any of
the Country People; the Reason was evident,
because Provisions being somewhat scarce, if the
Boors were not protected they would have fled
from their Houses, and the Army would have
been put to great Straits, being just entred into the
Enemies Country.</P>
<P>It happened that five <HI>English</HI> Soldiers straggling
beyond their Bounds were fallen upon, near a
Farm-House, by some of the Country People (for
indeed the Boors were oftentimes too unmerciful
to the Soldiers) as if they had plunder'd them,
when indeed they had not: The Soldiers de∣fended
themselves, got the better, and kill'd two
of the Boors; and being, as they thought, justly
provok'd by being first attack'd, they broke into
the House, and then used them roughly enough
indeed.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="239"/>
They found in the House a great Quantity of
Apples, the People being fled had left them in
Possession, and they made no Haste to go away,
but fell to work with the Apples; and heating the
Oven put a great Quantity of Apples into the
Oven to roast. In the mean Time the Boors,
who knew their Number to be but five, and had
got more Help on their Side, came down upon
them again, attack'd the House, forced their Way
in, master'd the <HI>Englishmen,</HI> kill'd two, and took
a third, and barbarously put him into the Oven,
which he had heated, where he was smother'd to
Death; it seems it was not hot enough to burn
him.</P>
<P>The other two escaped, but in coming back to
the Camp, they were immediately apprehended
by the Provosts, and brought to a Court Martial,
where they were sentenc'd not for Plundering, for
that did not appear, but for being out of the
Bounds appointed by the general Order, as a∣bove.</P>
<P>When the Sentence came to be executed, the
General was prevail'd upon to spare one of them,
and to order them to cast Lots for their Lives.
This, as it is known is usually done by throwing
Dice upon a Drumhead; and he that throws
highest or lowest, as is appointed before is to
die; at this time he that threw lowest was to
live.</P>
<P>When the Fellows were brought out to throw,
the first threw two Sixes, and fell immediately
to wringing his Hands, crying he was a dead
Man; but was as much surpriz'd with Joy, when
his Comrade throwing, there came up two Sixes
also.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="240"/>
The Officer appointed to see Execution was a
little doubtful what to do, but his Orders being
positive, he commanded them to throw again;
they did so, and each of them threw two Fives;
the Soldiers that stood round shouted, and said
neither of them was to die: The Officer being a
sober thinking Man, said it was strange, and
look'd like something from Heaven, and he would
not proceed without acquainting the Council of
War, which was then sitting; they consider'd a
while, and at last order'd them to take other Dice
and to throw again, which was done, and both
the Soldiers threw two Fours.</P>
<P>The Officer goes back to the Council of War,
who were surpriz'd very much, and looking on it
as the Voice of Heaven, respited the Execution
till the General was acquainted with it.</P>
<P>The General sends for the Men and examines
them strictly, who telling him the whole Story, he
pardon'd them with this Expression to those about
him, <HI>I love,</HI> says he, <HI>in such extraordinary Cases to
listen to the Voice of Providence.</HI></P>
<P>While we are in this un-inform'd State, where
we know so little of the invisible World, it would
be greatly our Advantage, if we knew rightly,
and without the Bondage of Enthusiasm and Su∣perstition,
how to make use of the Hints given
us from above, for our Direction in Matters of
the greatest Importance.</P>
<P>It has pleased God very much to streighten the
special and particular Directions, which he gives
to Men immediately from himself; but I dare not
say, they are quite ceased; we read of many Ex∣amples
in Scripture, how God spake to Men by
Voice immediately from Heaven, by Appearance
of Angels, or by Dreams and Visions of the
Night, and by all these not in Public and more
<PB N="225" REF="241"/>
extraordinary Cases only, but in private, personal,
and family Concerns.</P>
<P>Thus God is said to have appeared to <HI>Abraham,</HI>
to <HI>Lot,</HI> and to <HI>Jacob;</HI> Angels also have appeared
in many other Cases, and to many several Persons,
as to <HI>Manoah,</HI> and his Wife, to <HI>Zachariah,</HI> to the
Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and to the <HI>Apostles;</HI> others have
been warned in a Dream, as King <HI>Abimelech,</HI> the
false Prophet <HI>Balaam, Pontius Pilate</HI>'s Wife, <HI>Herod,
Joseph,</HI> the <HI>Apostles</HI> also, and many others.</P>
<P>We cannot say, but these and all the miracu∣lous
Voices, the prophetic Messages prefac'd
boldly by the Anc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ents, with <HI>thus saith the Lord</HI>
are ceas'd, and as we have <HI>a more sure Word of
Prophesy</HI> handed to us by the Mission of Gospel
Ministers; to which the Scripture says, <HI>We
do well that we take heed;</HI> and to whom our
blessed Lord has said, <HI>Lo, I am with you to the End
of the World:</HI> I say, as we have this Gospel back'd
with the Spirit and Prefence of God, we are no
Losers, if we observe the Rule laid down, <HI>viz.
that we be obedient to the heavenly Vision,</HI> for
such it is, as well as that of the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI>'s
Dream of the Sheet let down from Heaven.</P>
<P>I mention this to pay a due Reverence to the
Sufficiency of Gospel Revelation, and to the
guiding of the Spirit of God, who in spiritual
Things is given to <HI>lead us into all Truth,</HI> nor
would I have any Thing, which I am going to
say, tend to lessen these great Efficients of our
eternal Salvation.</P>
<P>But I am chiefly upon our Conduct in the infe∣rior
Life, as I may call it; and in this, I think,
the Voice of God, even his immediate Voicefrom
Heaven, is not entirely ceased from us, though it
may have changed the Mediums of Communica∣tion.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="242"/>
I have heard the Divines tell us by Way of Di∣stinction,
that there is a Voice of God in his
Word, and a Voice of God in his Work; the
latter I take to be a subject very awful and very
instructing.</P>
<P>This Voice of God in his Works, is either
heard in his Works which are already wrought,
such as of Creation, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>which fill us with Wonder
and Aston<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shment, Admiration and Adoration;
<HI>When I view the Heavens, the Work of thy Hands,
the Moon and the Stars which thon hast made, then I
say, What is Man,</HI> &amp;c. Or 2. His Works of Go∣vernment
and Providence, in which the infinite
Variety affords a pleasing and instructing Contem∣plation;
and it is without Question, our Wisdom
and Advantage to study and know them, and to
listen to the Voice of God in them: For this
listening to the Voice of Providence, is a Thing
so hard to direct, and so little understood, that I
find the very Thought of it is treated with Con∣tempt,
even by many pious and good People,
as leading to Superstition, to Enthusiasm, and
vain Fancies, tainted with Melancholly, and
amusing the Mind with the Vapours of the
Head.</P>
<P>It is true, an ill Use may be made of these
Things, and to tye People too strictly down to a
Rule, where their own Observation is to be the
Judge, endangers the running into many foolish
Extreams, entitling a distemper'd Brain, too much
to the Exposition of the sublimest Things; and tack∣ing
the awful Name of Providence to every fancy
of their own.</P>
<P>From Hence I think, too much proceeds the
extraordinary (Note, <HI>I say, Extraordinary</HI>) Ho∣mage
paid to Omens, flying of Birds, Voices,
Noises, Predictions, and a thousand foolish
<PB N="227" REF="243"/>
Things, in which I shall endeavour to state the
Case fairly between the Devil and Mankind: But
at present I need say no more here, than that they
have nothing to do with the Subject I am now
upon, or the Subject I am upon with them.</P>
<P>But as my Design is serious, and I hope pious,
I shall keep strictly to the Exposition I give of
my own Meaning, and meddle with no other.</P>
<P>By the Voice of Providence therefore, I shall
confine myself to the particular Circumstances in∣cident
and accident which every Man's Life is full
of, and which are in a more extraordinary man∣ner,
said to be peculiar to himself or to his
Family.</P>
<P>By listening to them, I mean, making such due
Application of them to his own Circumstances,
as becomes a Christian, for Caution in his Con∣duct,
and all manner of Instruction, receiving all
the Hints as from Heaven, returning all the
Pra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se to, making all the Improvement for, and re∣verencing
the Sovereignty of his Maker in every
Thing, not disputing or reproaching the Justice
of Providence; and which is the main Thing I
aim at, taking such Notice of the several Provi∣dences,
that happen in the Course of our Lives,
as by one Circumstance to learn how to behave in
another.</P>
<P>For Example, supposing from my own Story,
When a young Fellow broke from his Friends,
trampled upon all the wise Advices, and most af∣fectionate
Perswasions of his Father, and even the
Tears and Entreaties of a tender Mother, and
would go away to Sea; but is check'd in his first
Excursions by being Shipwreck'd, and in the ut∣most
Distress sav'd by the Assistance of another
Ship's Boat, seeing the Ship he was in, soon after
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the Bottom; ought not such a young Man
<PB N="228" REF="244"/>
to have listened to the Voice of this Providence,
and have taken it for a Summons to him; that
when he was on Shore, he should stay on Shore,
and go back to the Arms of his Friends, hearken
to their Council, and not precipitate himself into
farther Mischiefs; what Happiness might such a
prudent Step have procured, what Miseries and
Mischiefs would it have prevented in the rest of
his unfortunate Life.</P>
<P>An Acquaintance of mine, who had several such
Circumstances befel him, as those which I am in∣clin'd
to call Warnings, but entirely neglected
them, and laugh'd at those that did otherwise,
suffered deeply for his dis-regard of Omens; he
took Lodgings in a Village near the City of <HI>Lon∣den,</HI>
and in a House, where either he sought <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bad
Company, or at best could meet with little that
was good. Providence that seemed to animadvert
upon his Conduct, so ordered it that something
or other mischievous always happened to him
there, or as he went thither; several Times he
was robbed on the Highway going thither, once
or twice taken very ill, at other Times his Affairs
in the World went ill, while he diverted himself
there; several of his Friends caution'd him of it
and told him, he ought to consider that some su∣perior
Hand seemed to hint to him, that he
should come there no more; he slighted the Hint,
or at least neglected it after some Time, and went
to the same Place again: But was so terrified
with a most dreadful Tempest of Thunder and
Lightning, which fell as it were more particular∣ly
upon that Part of the Country than upon
others; that he took it as a Warning from Heaven,
and resolv'd not to go there again, and some
Time after a Fire destroyed that House, very few
escaping that were in it.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="245"/>
It would be an ill Account we should give of
the Government of divine Providence in the
World, if we should argue, that its Events are so
unavoidable, and every Circumstance so determin∣ed,
that nothing can be altered; and that therefore
these Warnings of Providence are inconsistent with
the Nature of it. This besides that I think it
would take from the Sovereignty of Providence,
and deny even God himself the Privilege of being
a free Agent, it would also so contradict the Ex∣perience
of every Man living, in the Varieties of
his respective Life, that he should be unable to
give any Account for what End many Things,
which Providence directs in the World, are di∣rected,
and why so many Things happen which
do happen; why are Evils attending us so evi∣dently
foretold, that by those Fore-tellings they are
avoided, if it was not determined before that they
should be avoided, and should not befal us?</P>
<P>People that tye up all to Events and Causes,
strip the Providence of God which guides the
World of all its Superintendency, and leave it
no room to act as a wise Disposer of Things.</P>
<P>It seems to me that the immutable Wisdom and
Power of the Creator, and the Notion of it in
the Minds of Men, is as dutifully preserved, and is
as legible to our Understanding, though there be
a Hand left at Liberty to direct the Course of na∣tural
Causes and Events; 'Tis sufficient to the
Honour of an immutable Deity, that for the
common Incidents of Life, they be left to the
Disposition of a daily Agitator, namely, divine
Providence, to order and direct them as it shall see
good, within the natural Limits of Cause and
Consequence.</P>

This seems to me a much more rational System,
than that of tying up the Hands of the supreme
Power to a Road of Things, so that none can be
acted or permitted, but such as was so appointed
before to be acted and permitted.</P>
<P>But what, if after all, we were to sit down and
acknowledge, that the immutability of God's
Being, and the Unchangeableness of his Actings,
are not easy to be comprehended by us, or that
we may say we are not able to reconcile them
with the infinite Variation of his Providence,
which in all its Actings seems to us to be at full
Liberty to determine anew, and give Events a
turn this Way or that Way, as its Sovereignty
and Wisdom, shall direct; does it follow, that
these Things are not reconcileable, because we
cannot reconcile them? why should we not as well
say, nothing of God is to be understood, because
we cannot understand it? or that nothing in Nature
is intelligible, but what we can understand?</P>
<P>Who can understand the Reason, and much less
the Manner of the Needle tending to the Pole,
by being touch'd with the Loadstone, and by
what Operation the magnetic Vertue is convey∣ed
with a Touch? why that Vertue is not com∣municable
to other Metals, such as Gold, Silver,
or Copper, but to Iron only? what Sympathetic
Influence is there between the Stone and the
Star or the Pole? why tending to that Point in
the whole Arch, and not to any other, and why
face about to the South Pole as soon as it has
past the Equinox? yet we see all these Things
in their Operations and Events, we know
they must be reconcileable in Nature, though we
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> reconcile them, and intelligible in Nature,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we cannot understand them: Sure it is
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> reasonable then for us to believe, that
<PB N="231" REF="247"/>
the various Actings of Providence, which to us
appear changeable, one Decree, as it were, re∣versing
another, and one Action superseding a∣nother,
may be as reconcilable to the Immutabi∣lity
of God, and to the Unchangeableness of his
Purposes, tho' we cannot understand, how it is
brought to pass, as it is to believe, that there is
a Reason to be given for the Agreement and sim∣pathetick
Correspondence between the <HI>Magn t</HI> and
the <HI>Pole,</HI> tho at present the Manner of it is not
discover'd, and cannot be understood.</P>
<P>If then the Hand of divine Providence has a
spontaneous Power of acting, and directed by its
own Sovereignty, proceeds by such Methods, as
it thinks fit, and as we see daily in the Course
of human things: Our Business is to converse
with the acting Part of Providence, with which
we more immediately have to do, and not con∣found
our Judgment with things which we cannot
fully comprehend, such as the Why, to what
End, and the how in what Manner, it acts so
and so.</P>
<P>As we are then conversant with the immediate
Actions of divine Providence, it is our Business to
study it as much as may be in that Part of its
Actings, wherein it is to be known; and this in∣cludes
the silent Actings of Providence, as well as
those which are more loud, and which being de∣clar'd,
speak in publick.</P>
<P>There are several silent Steps, which Providence
takes in the World, which summon our Attention;
and he that will not listen to them, shall deprive
himself of much of the Caution and Council, as
well as Comfort, which he might otherwise have
in his Passage thro' this Life, particularly by thus
listening to the Voice, as I call it, of Providence,
we have the Comfort of seeing, that really an
<PB N="232" REF="248"/>
invisible and powerful Hand is employ'd in, and
concern'd for our Preservation and Prosperity in
the World; And who can look upon the manifest De∣liverances
which he meets with in the infinite Vari∣ety
of Life, without being convinc'd that they are
wrought for him without his own Assistance, by
the wise and merciful Dispositions of an invisible
and friendly Power.</P>
<P>The bringing good Events to pass by the most
threatning Causes, as it testifies a Power that has
the Government of Causes and Effects in its Hand,
so it gives a very convincing Evidence of that
Power, being in good Terms with us; as on the
contrary, when the like Providence declares against
us, we ought to make a suitable Use of it another
Way, that is to say, take the just Alarm, and ap∣ply
to the necessary Duties of Humiliation and
Repentance.</P>
<P>These things may be jested with by the Men of
Fashion; but I am supposing myself talking to
Men that have a Sense of a future State, and of
the Oeconomy of an invisible World upon them,
and neither to Atheists, Scepticks, or Persons in∣different,
who are indeed near of Kin to them
both.</P>
<P>As there are just Reflections to be made upon
the various Conduct of Providence in the several
Passages of Man's Life, so there are infinite Cir∣cumstances,
in which we may furnish our selves
with Directions in the Course of Life, and in the
most sudden Incidents, as well to obtain Good,
as avoid Evil.</P>
<P>Much of the Honour due to the Goodness of
Providence, is unjustly taken away from it, by
Men that give themselves a Loose in a general
Neglect of these things: But that which is still
more absurd to me is, that some Men are obsti∣nately
<PB N="233" REF="249"/>
resolv'd against paying the Homage of their
Deliverances to their Maker, or paying the Re∣verence
due to his Terrors, in any thing that be∣falls
them ill, where it ought to be paid, that
they will give all that Honour to another. If it
was well, they tell you, they know not how, but
so it happen'd, or it was so by good Chance,
and the like. This is a Sort of Language I can∣not
understand: It seems to be a felonious
Thought in its very Design, robbing Heaven of
the Honour due to it, and listing our selves in
the Regiment of the Ungrateful.</P>
<P>But this is not all, for one Crime leads on to a∣ther,
if this Part is Felony or Robbery, the
next is Treason, for resolving first to deny the
Homage of good or evil Events to God from
whose Hands they come, they go on and pay
it to the Devil, the Enemy of his Praise, and
Rival of his Power.</P>
<P>Two of these Wretches travell'd a little Journey
with me some Years ago; and in their Return,
some Time after I was gone from them, they met
with a very different Adventure, and telling me
the Story, they express'd themselves thus, <HI>They
were riding from</HI> Huntington <HI>towards</HI> London, <HI>and
in some Lanes betwixt</HI> Huntington <HI>and</HI> Caxton, <HI>one
happen'd by a Slip of his Horse's Foot, which lam'd him
a little, to stay about half a Mile behind the other, was
set upon by some Highway-men, who robb'd him, and
abus'd him very much; the other went on to</HI> Caxton,
<HI>not taking Care of his Companion, thinking he had stay'd
on some particular Occasion, and escap'd the Thieves,
they making off cross the Country towards</HI> Cambridge.</P>
<P>Well, says I to the first, How came you to
escape? <HI>I don't know not I,</HI> says he, I <HI>happen'd</HI> not
to look behind me, when his Horse stumbl'd, and
I went forward, and <HI>by good Luck,</HI> adds he again,
<PB N="234" REF="250"/>
I heard nothing of the Matter; here was, <HI>it hap∣pen'd,</HI>
and <HI>by good Luck,</HI> but not the least Sense of
the Government of Providence in this Affair, or
its Disposition for his Good, but an empty Idol
of Air, or rather an imaginary nonsensical <HI>Nothing,</HI>
an Image more inconsistent than those I mention'd
among the <HI>Chineses;</HI> not a Monster indeed of a
ftightful Shape, and ugly Figure, loathsome and
frightful, but a meer <HI>Phantasm,</HI> an Idea, a None-Entity,
a Name without being a miscall'd, unborn,
nothing, hap, luck, Chance, that is to say, a Name
put upon the <HI>Medium,</HI> which they set up in their
Imagination, for Want of a Will to acknowledge
their Maker, and recognize the Goodness which
had particularly preserv'd him.</P>
<P>This was the most ungrateful Piece of Fol∣ly,
or to speak more properly, the maddest and foo∣lishest
Piece of Ingratitude that ever I met
with.</P>
<P>Well, if this was foolish and preposterous, the
other was as wicked and detestable: For when
the first had told his Tale, I turn'd to the other,
and ask'd him, What was the Matter? <HI>Why!
How came this to pass?</HI> said I, <HI>why this Disaster has
fallen all upon you? How was it?</HI> Nay, <HI>says he,</HI> I
don't know, I was a little behind, and my Horse
<HI>chanc'd</HI> to slip, and lame himself, and he went for∣ward,
and left me; and as the Devil would have
it, these Fellows came cross the Country, and
chopt upon me, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Here was first <HI>Chance,</HI> the same Mock-Goddess,
as before, lam'd his Horse, and next, the Devil
order'd the Highway-men to chop upon him that
Moment. Now, tho' it may true, that the High∣way-men
were even by their Employment doing
the Devil's Office of going to and fro, seeking
whom they might plunder; yet 'twas a higher
<PB N="235" REF="251"/>
Hand than Satan's, that deliver'd this poor blind
Fellow into their Power.</P>
<P>We have a plain Guide for this in Scripture
Language, in the Law of Man-slaughter, or
Death, <HI>as the call it foolishly enough,</HI> by Misadven∣ture
it is in the 21 <HI>Exod.</HI> 13. in the Case of casual
killing a Man, it is express'd thus, <HI>If a Man lye
not in Wait, but God deliver him into his Hand.</HI> This
was not to be accounted Murther, but the Slayer
was to fly to the City of Refuge.</P>
<P>Here it is evident, that God takes all these
Misadventures into his own Hand; and a Man
kill'd by Accident, is a Man whom God has de∣liver'd
up, for what End in his Providence is known
only to himself, to be kill'd in that Manner, per∣haps
vindictively, perhaps not.</P>
<P>With what Face can any Man say, this was <HI>as
the Devil would have it,</HI> or <HI>as bad Luck would have
it,</HI> or it <HI>happen'd,</HI> or <HI>chanc'd,</HI> or <HI>fell out;</HI> all which
are our simple and empty Ways of talking of things
that are order'd by the immediate Hand or Dire∣ction
of God's Providence.</P>
<P>The Words last quoted from the Scripture of
<HI>God's delivering a Man into another Man's Hand to
be killed unwillingly,</HI> are fully explained in another
Place, <HI>Deut.</HI> xix. 5.</P>
<P>As when a Man goeth into the Wood with his Neigh∣bour,
to hew Wood, and his Hand fetches a Stroke
with the Ax to cut down the Tree, and the Head slip∣peth
from the Helve, and lighteth upon his Neighbour,
that he die; he shall flee unto one of those Cities, and
live.</P>
<P>The wicked thoughtless Creature, I have just
mentioned, whose Horse fell lame, and stopt his
Travelling, till he might come just in the Way of
those Thieves, who it seems were crossing the
Country, perhaps upon some other Exploit, ought
<PB N="236" REF="252"/>
to have reflected, that Providence, to chastise
him, and bring him to a Sense of his Dependance
upon, and being subjected to his Power, had di∣rected
him to be separated from his Companion,
that he might fall into the Hands that robb'd and
abus'd him; and the other had no less Obliga∣tion
to give Thanks for his Deliverance: But how
contrary they acted in both Cases, you have
heard.</P>
<P>We have had abundance of Collections, in my
Remembrance, of remarkable Providences, as they
are call'd; and many People are forward to call
them so: But this does not come up to the Case
in Hand.</P>
<P>Tho' contemning Providence, and giving the
Homage due to it, as above, to the Devil, or to
Chance, Fate, and I know not what Embrio's of
the Fancy are impious; yet every one that avoids
this Evil, does not come up to the particular Point
I am speaking of; for there is a manifest Diffe∣rence
between acknowledging the Being and Ope∣rations
of Providence, and <HI>listning to its Voice,</HI> as
many People acknowledge a God, that obey none
of his Commands, and concern themselves in no∣thing
of their Duty to him.</P>
<P>To listen to the Voice of Providence, is to take
strict Notice of all the remarkable Steps of Provi∣dence,
which relate to us in particular, to observe,
if there is nothing in them instructing to our Con∣duct;
no Warning to us for avoiding some Dan∣ger;
no Direction for the taking some particular
Steps for our Safety or Advantage; no Hint to re∣mind
us of such and such things <HI>omitted;</HI> no Con∣viction
of something <HI>committed;</HI> no vindictive
Step, by Way of Retaliation, marking out the
Crime in the Punishment; You may easily ob∣serve
the Differences between the Directions and
<PB N="237" REF="253"/>
Warnings of Providence, when duly listned to,
and the Notices of Spirits from an invisible
World, <HI>viz.</HI> that these are dark Hints of Evil, with
very little Direction to avoid it: But those Noti∣ces,
which are to be taken from the Proceedings
of Providence, tho' the Voice be a Kind of silent
or soft Whisper; yet 'tis generally attended with
an Offer of the Means for escaping the Evil, nay,
very often leads by the Hand to the very proper
Steps to be taken; and even obliges us, by a strong
Conviction of the Reason of it, to take those
Steps.</P>
<P>It is in vain for me to run into a Collection of
Stories; for Example, where the Variety is infinite,
and things vary as every particular Man's Circum∣stances
vary: But as every Event in the World is
manag'd by the Superintendency of Providence; so
every Providence has in it some thing instructing,
some thing that calls upon us to look up, or look
out, or look in.</P>
<P>Every one of those Heads are big with particu∣lar
Explanations; but my Business is not Preach∣ing;
I am making Observations and Reflections,
let those make Enlargements who read it: In a Word,
there is scarce any particular Providence attends
our Lives, but we shall find, if we give due
Weight to it, that it calls upon us, either.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Proportion between the Chri∣stian
and Pagan World.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Have said something of this al∣ready
in my Enquiry after the
State of Religion in the World;
but upon some Reflections which
fell in my Way since, I think it
may offer further Thoughts, very
improving, as well as diverting.</P>
<P>When we view the World geographically,
take the Plan of the Globe, and measure it by
Line, and cut it out into Latitude and Longitude,
Degrees, Leagues, and Miles; we may see indeed
that a pretty large Spot of the whole, is at pre∣sent
under the Government of Christian Powers
and Princes, or under the Influence of their Power
and Commerce, by Arms, Navies, Colonies, and
Plantations; or their Factories, Missionaries, Resi∣dences,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But I am loth to say we should take this for a
Fulfilling the Promise made to the Messiah, that
his Kingdom should be exalted above all Nations,
and the Gospel be heard to the End of the Earth,
I was going to say, <HI>and yet without any Prophane∣ss;</HI>
that we hope God will not <HI>put in off</HI> S O.
I must acknowledge, I expect in the Fulfilling of
these Promises, that the Time will come, <HI>when the
<PB N="240" REF="256"/>
Knowledge of God shall cover the Earth, as the Waters
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>over the Sea,</HI> that the Church of God shall be set
open to the four Winds, <HI>that the Mountain of the
Lords House shall be exalted above the Tops of the
Mountains, and all the Nations shall flow into it,</HI> Isa.
ii. 2. that is to say, that the Christian Religion,
or the Profession of the Doctrine of the MESSIAH,
shall be made national over the whole Globe, ac∣cording
to those Words, <HI>Matth.</HI> xxiv. 14. <HI>Mark</HI> xiii.
13. <HI>Luke</HI> xxiv. 17. But this may be a little too
apocalyptical, or visionary for the Times; and 'tis
no Business of mine, to enter upon the Interpre∣tation
of Scripture Difficulties, whatever I may
understand, or believe my self about them; but
rather to make my Observations, as I have be∣gun,
upon things which now are, and which we
have seen and know, let what is to come, be as he
pleases, who has ordered things past, and knows
what is to follow.</P>
<P>The present Case is, to speak of the mathema∣tical
Proportion that there is now to be observed
upon the Plain of the Globe, and observe how
small a Part of the World it is, where the Chri∣stian
Religion has really prevail'd, and is natio∣nally
profess'd, I speak of the Christian Religion,
where it is, as I call it, National, <HI>that is,</HI> in its
utmost Latitude; and I do so, that I may give
the utmost Advantage, even against my self, in
what I am going to say; and therefore, when I
come to make Deductions for the Mixtures of bar∣barous
Nations, I shall do it fairly also.</P>
<P>I have nothing to do with the Distinctions of
Christians: I hope none will object against calling
the Roman Church, a Christian Church, in this
Respect, and the Professors of the Popish Church,
<HI>Christians;</HI> neither do I scruple to call the Greek
Church <HI>Christian,</HI> tho' in some Places so blended
<PB N="241" REF="257"/>
with Superstition, and barbarous Customs, as in
<HI>Georgia, Armenia,</HI> and the Borders of <HI>Persia</HI> and
<HI>Tartary;</HI> likewise in many Parts of the <HI>Czar</HI>
of <HI>Muscovy</HI>'s Dominions, that (as before) the Name
of Christ is little more than just spoken of, and
literally known, without any material Knowledge
of his Person, Nature, and Dignity; or of the
Homage due to him as the Redeemer of the
World.</P>
<P>The Nations of the World then, where Christ
is acknowledged, and the Christian Religion is
profess'd nationally, be it <HI>Romish</HI> Church or <HI>Greek</HI>
Church, or even the Protestant Church, in∣cluding

<P>The chief Seat of the Christian Religion is at
present in <HI>Europe:</HI> But if we measure the Quarter
of the World, we call <HI>Europe</HI> upon the Plan of the
Globe, and cast up the northern, frozen, and indeed
unhabitable Part of it, such <HI>Laponia, Petzora, Can∣dora,
Obdora,</HI> and the <HI>Samoiedes,</HI> with Part of <HI>Siberia,</HI>
they are all Pagans, with the eastern unpeopl'd
Desarts, bordering upon <HI>Asia,</HI> on the Way to <HI>Chi∣na,</HI>
and the vast Extent of Land on that Side,
which tho' nominally under the Dominion of
<HI>Muscovy,</HI> is yet all Pagan, even nationally so, un∣under
no real Government, but of their own Pa∣gan
Customs.</P>
<P>If we go from thence to the <HI>South,</HI> and take out
or it the <HI>European Tartars, viz.</HI> of <HI>Circassia,</HI>
the <HI>Crimee,</HI> and <HI>Budziack,</HI> if you go on, and
draw a Line from the <HI>Crim Tartary</HI> to the

and cut off all the Grand Seignior's <HI>European</HI> Do∣minions;
I say, take this Extent of Land out of
<HI>Europe,</HI> and the Remainder does not measure full
two Thirds of Land in <HI>Europe,</HI> under the Christi∣an
Government, much of which is also Desart,
and uninhabited, or at least, by such as cannot be
call'd Christians, and do not concern themselves
about it, as particularly, the <HI>Swedish</HI> and <HI>Norwe∣gean</HI>
Lapland, the more eastern and southern <HI>Mus∣covy,</HI>
beyond the <HI>Wolga,</HI> even to <HI>Karakathay,</HI> and to
the Borders of <HI>Asia</HI> on the Side of <HI>India;</HI> I say,
taking in this Part, not above one half of <HI>Europe</HI>
is really inhabited by Christians.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="259"/>
The <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> of the Religion, of whose
Subjects I have said enough, is Lord of a vast ex∣tended
Country; and those who have measur'd
it critically, say, his Dominions are larger than all
the rest of <HI>Europe;</HI> that is to say, that he possesses
a full Half as much as <HI>Europe;</HI> and in those Domi∣nions,
he is Master of Abundance of Nations, that
are Pagan or Mahometan, as in particular <HI>Circas∣sia,</HI>
being conquer'd by him, the <HI>Circassian Tartars,</HI>
who are all Mahometans, or the most of them, are
his Subjects.</P>
<P>However, since a Christian Monarch governs
them, we must upon the Plan I laid down, call
this a Christian Country; and that alone obliges
me to give two Thirds of <HI>Europe</HI> to the Chri∣stians.</P>
<P>But this will bring another Account upon my
Hands to ballance it, <HI>viz.</HI> That excepting this
two Thirds, there will not come one Christian to
be accounted for in any of the other three Parts of
the World, except <HI>Georgia</HI> and <HI>Armenia;</HI> as for
<HI>Africa,</HI> there is nothing to be mention'd on that
Side: All the Christians that are on the Conti∣nent
of <HI>Africk,</HI> consisting only of a few Merchants
residing at the Coast Towns in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI>
as at <HI>Alexandria, Grand Cairo, Tunis, Tripoli, Al∣gier,</HI>
&amp;c. The Factories of the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI>
on the Coast of <HI>Guinea,</HI> the <HI>Gold</HI> Coast, the Coast
of <HI>Angola,</HI> and at the <HI>Cape of Good Hope;</HI> all which
put together, as I have calculated them, and as
they are calculated by a better Judgment than mine,
will not amount to 5000 People, excepting Chri∣stian
Slaves in <HI>Sallee, Algier, Tunis, Tripoli,</HI> &amp;c
which are not so many more.</P>
<P><HI>America</HI> is throng'd with Christians, God wot,
such as they are; for I must confess, the <HI>Euro∣pean</HI>
Inhabitants of some of the Colonies there,
<PB N="244" REF="260"/>
as well <HI>French</HI> and <HI>English,</HI> as <HI>Spanish</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI>
very ill merit that Name.</P>
<P>Some Part of <HI>America</HI> is entirely under the Do∣minion
and Government of the <HI>European</HI> Nations;
and having indeed destroy'd the Natives, and
made desolate the Country, they may be said to
be Christian Countries in the Sense, as above.</P>
<P>But what Numbers do these amount to, com∣par'd
to the Inhabitants of so great a Part of the
World, as that of <HI>America,</HI> Which at least is three
Times as big as <HI>Europe,</HI> and in which are still
vast extended Countries, infinite Numbers of Peo∣ple
of Nations unknown, and even unheard of;
which neither the <HI>English, French, Spanish,</HI> or <HI>Por∣tuguese</HI>
have ever seen; Witness the populous Ci∣ties
and innumerable Nations, which Sir <HI>Walter
Raleigh</HI> met with in his Voyage up the great
River <HI>Or<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onoque;</HI> in one of which they talk of two
Millions of People, Witness the Nations infinite∣ly
populous, spread on both Sides the River de
<HI>Amezones,</HI> and all the Country between these two
prodigious Rivers, being a Country above 400
Miles in Breadth, and 1600 Miles in Length,
besides its Extent South even to the <HI>Rio Para∣guay,</HI>
and S. E. to the <HI>Brasils,</HI> a rich, fruitful, and
populous Country; and in which, by the Ac∣counts
given, there must be more People inhabit∣ing
at this Time, than in all the Christian Part of
<HI>Europe</HI> put together, being the Chief, if not the on∣ly
Part of <HI>America,</HI> into which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> ne∣ver
came and whether the frighted People sled
from them, being so fortify'd with Rivers and un∣pass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oys and rapid Currents, and so inac∣cessible
by the Number of Inhabitants, the Heat
of the Climate, and the Mountains, Waterfals,
and such other Obstructions, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
durst never attempt to penetrate the Way.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="261"/>
What are the Numbers of Christians in <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI>
put them altogether to the Inhabitants of
these Parts of <HI>America,</HI> besides the Northern
Parts of <HI>America,</HI> not enquir'd into.</P>
<P>But we are not calculating of People yet, but
the Extent of Land, that the Christians possess,
the <HI>British</HI> Colonies in the <HI>North,</HI> are by far the
most populous even more than the <HI>Spaniards</HI> them∣selves,
though the latter extend themselves over
more Land.</P>
<P>The <HI>British</HI> Colonies in the <HI>North</HI> of <HI>America</HI>
are supposed to contain Three Hundred Thousand
Souls, including <HI>Nova Scotia, New England, New
York, New Jersey, East</HI> and <HI>West Pensilvania, Ma∣ryland,
Virginia,</HI> and <HI>Carolina,</HI> and these lye ex∣tended
upon the Coast from the Latitude of 32
Degrees, to 47, or thereabouts, being about 750
Miles in Length; but then much of this is very
thinly-peopled, and the Breadth they lye <HI>West</HI>
into the Country is little or nothing, 50 Miles
or 60 Miles is in many Places the most; and ex∣cept
some Plantations in <HI>Virginia,</HI> in <HI>Rapahanock,</HI>
and <HI>Janes</HI> River in <HI>Virginia,</HI> occasioned by the
great In-let of the <HI>Bay</HI> there, and of the Rivers
that fall into it. We can see nothing an hundred
Miles within that Land but waste and Woods,
whose Inhabitants seem to be fled farther up in∣to
the Country from the Face of their Enemies
the Christians.</P>
<P>So that all this planting though so considerable,
amounts to no more compared to the Country it∣self,
than a long narrow Slip of Land upon the
Sea-Coast, there being very few <HI>English</HI> Inhabi∣tants
planted any where above twenty Miles
from the Sea, or from some navigable River, and
even that Sea-Coast itself very thinly inhabited,
and particularly from <HI>New-England</HI> to <HI>New York,</HI>
<PB N="246" REF="262"/>
from <HI>New-England</HI> North to <HI>Annapolis,</HI> from <HI>Vir∣ginia</HI>
to <HI>Carolina;</HI> so that all this great Colony or
Collection of Colonies, nay, tho' we include the
<HI>French</HI> at <HI>Canada,</HI> are but a Point, a Handful, com∣par'd
to the vast Extent of Land lying West and
North-West from them, even to the South-Sea,
an Extent of Continent full of innumerable Na∣tions
of People unknown, undiscovered, never
search'd into or indeed heard of, but from one
another, much greater in its Extent than all
<HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>If we take the North Part of <HI>America</HI> exclusive
of all the Country, which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> possess,
and which they call the Empire of <HI>Mexico;</HI> and ex∣clusive
too of what the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French</HI> possess
on the Coast, and in the two Rivers of <HI>Canada</HI>
and <HI>Missisippi</HI> as above, which indeed are but Trifles;
the rest of that Country <HI>which as far as it has been
travelied into, is found exceeding populous,</HI> is a great
deal larger than all <HI>Europe,</HI> though we have not
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the most Northern, Frozen and almost
unhabitable Part of it, where no End can be found,
and where it is no doubt, but there is a conti∣guous
Continent with the Northern Part of <HI>Asia,</HI>
or so near joining, as to be only parted by a nar∣row
Gulph and Streight of Sea, easily passed over
both by Man or Beast, or else it would be hard
to give an Account how Man or Beast came into
that Part of the World; I say, this vast Conti∣nent
full of People, and no doubt, inhabited by
many Millions of Souls, is all wrapt up in Idola∣try
and Paganism, given up to Ignorance and
Blindness, worshipping the Sun, the Moon, the
Fire, the Hills their Fathers, and in a Word the
Devil.</P>
<P>As to the Thing we call Religion, or the Know∣ledge
of the true God, much less the Doctrine of
<PB N="247" REF="263"/>
the Messiah, and the Name of Christ, they not
only have not, but never had the least Intimation of
it on Earth, or Revelation of it from Heaven,
till the <HI>Spaniards</HI> came among them: Nay,
and now Christians are come among them,
'tis hard to say, whether the Paganism is
much abated, except by the infinite Ravages the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> made where they came, who rooted
out the Idolatry by destroying the Idolaters, not
by converting them; having cruelly cut off, as
their own Writers affirm, above seventy Millions
of People, and left the Country naked of its In∣habitants
for many hundred Miles together.</P>
<P>But what need we come to Calculations for the
present Time with Respect to <HI>America,</HI> let us but
be at the Trouble to look back a little more than
a Hundred Years, which is as nothing at all in the
Argument; how had the whole Continent of <HI>A∣merica</HI>
extended almost from Pole to Pole, with
all the Islands round it, and peopled with such innu∣merable
Multitudes of People, been as it were en∣tirely
abandoned to the Devil's Government, even
from the beginning of Time, or at least from the
second Peopling the World by <HI>Noah</HI> to the 16th
Century, when <HI>Ferdinando Cortez,</HI> General for the
famous <HI>Charles</HI> the 5th, first landed in the Gulph
of <HI>Mexico?</HI></P>
<P>We have heard much of the Cruelty of the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
in destroying such Multitudes of the Inha∣bitants
there, and of cutting off whole Nations
by Fire and Sword: But as I am for giving up
all the Actions of Men to the Government of Pro∣vidence,
it seems to me, that Heaven had
determined such an Act of Vengeance should
be executed, and of which the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
were Instruments, to destroy those People, who
were come up (by the Influence of the Devil, no
<PB N="248" REF="264"/>
Doubt) to such a dreadful height, in that abhorr'd
Custom of human Sacrifices, that the innocent
Blood cried for it, and it seemed to be a Time to put
a Stop to that Crime, lest the very Race of People
should at last be extinct by their own Butcheries.</P>
<P>The Magnitude of this may be guessed at, by
the Temple consecrated to the great Idol of
<HI>Vis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lip<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stli</HI> in the City of <HI>Mexico,</HI> where at the
Command of <HI>Montezuma</HI> the Pagan Monarch,
twenty thousand Men were sacrificed in a Year,
and the Wall hung a Foot thick with clotted
Blood, dashed in Ceremony against the Side of
that Place on those Occasions.</P>
<P>This Abomination God in his Providence, put
an End to, by destroying those Nations from the
Face of the Earth, bringing a Race of bearded
Strangers upon them, cutting in Pieces Man, Wo∣man
and Child, destroying their Idols, and even the
Idolatry it self by the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> who, however
wicked in themselves, yet were in this to be
esteemed Instruments in the Hand of Heaven, to
execute the divine Justice, on Nations, whose
Crimes were come up to a full Height, and that
call'd for Vengeance.</P>
<P>I make no doubt (to carry on this Digression a
little farther) that when God cast out the Hea∣then,
so the Scripture calls it, from before the
<HI>Israelites,</HI> and the Iniquity of the People of the
Land was full, <HI>Joshua, Moses,</HI> and the <HI>Israelites</HI>
were tax'd with as much Cruelty and Inhumanity,
in destroying the Cities, killing Man, Woman,
and Child; nay, even destroying the very Cattle,
and Trees, and Fruits of the Earth, as ever the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> were charg'd with in the Conquest of
<HI>Mexico.</HI></P>
<P>This is apparent by the Terror that was spread
upon the Minds o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the People <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound about them,
<PB N="249" REF="265"/>
whereof thousands fled to other Parts of the
World. That History tells us, that the first
Builders of the City of <HI>Carthage,</HI> long before the
<HI>Roman</HI> Times, or before the Fable of Queen <HI>Dido,</HI>
were some <HI>Phenicians,</HI> that is to say, <HI>Canaanites,</HI>
who flying for their Lives, got Ships and went
away to Sea, planting themselves on the Coast of
<HI>Africk,</HI> as the first Place of Safety they arriv'd at,
and to prove this a Pillar of Stone, was found not
far from <HI>Tripoli,</HI> on which was cut in <HI>Phenician</HI>
Characters, these Words, <HI>We are of those who fled
from the Face of</HI> Joshua <HI>the Robber.</HI></P>
<P>The Cruelties of the <HI>Israelites,</HI> in destroying
the Nations of the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> was com∣manded
from Heaven; and therein <HI>Joshua</HI> was
justify'd in what was done. The Cruelties of the
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> however abhorr'd by us, was doubtless
an Appointment of God, for the Destruction of the
wickedest and most abominable People upon
Earth.</P>
<P>But this is all a Digression; I come to my Cal∣culation:
It is true, that the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> whom I
allow to be Christians, have possess'd the Empires
of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru:</HI> But after all the Havock
they made, and the Millions of Souls they dis∣miss'd
out of Life there, yet the Natives are in∣finitely
the Majority of the Inhabitants; and tho'
many of them are christianiz'd, they are little more
than subjected, and take all the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> Christi∣ans,
and all the <HI>Portuguese</HI> in the <HI>Brasils,</HI> all the
<HI>English</HI> and <HI>French</HI> in the <HI>North,</HI> and in a Word, all
the Christians in <HI>America,</HI> and put them together,
they will not ballance one Part of the Pagans or
Mahometans in <HI>Europe:</HI> For Example, Take the
<HI>Crim Tartars</HI> of <HI>Europe,</HI> who inhabit the Bank of
the <HI>Euxine</HI> Sea, they are more in Number than all
the Christians in <HI>America;</HI> so that setting one Na∣tion
<PB N="250" REF="266"/>
against the other, and you may reckon that
there is not one Christian, or as if there were not
one Christian in those three Parts of the World, <HI>Asia,
Africa,</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> except the <HI>Greeks</HI> of <HI>Asia.</HI></P>
<P>This is a just but a very sad Account of the
small Extent of Christian Knowledge in the
World; and were it consider'd, as it ought, would
put the most powerful Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> upon
thinking of some Methods, at least to open a Way
for the spreading Christian Knowledge. I am
not much of the Opinion indeed, that Religion
should be planted by the Sword: But as the Chri∣stian
Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> however few in Number,
are yet so superior to all the rest of the World in
martial Experience and the Art of War, nothing
is more certain than that, if they could unite their
Interest, they are able to beat Paganism out of the
World. Nothing is more certain than this, that
would the Christian Princes unite their Powers, and
act in Concert, they might destroy the <HI>Turkish</HI> Em∣pire,
and the <HI>Persian</HI> Kingdom, and beat the very
Name of Mahomet out of the World.</P>
<P>It is no Boast to say, That were there no inte∣stine
Broils among us, the Christian Soldiery is
so evidently superior to the <HI>Turks</HI> at this Time,
that had they all join'd after the late Battel at
<HI>Belgrade,</HI> to have sent 80000 <HI>Veteran</HI> Soldiers to
have join'd Prince <HI>Eugene,</HI> and supply'd him with
Money and Provisions by the Ports of the <HI>Adriatic</HI>
Gulph, and the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> that Prince would in
two or three Campaigns, have driven the Ma∣hometans
out of <HI>Europe,</HI> taken <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and
have overturn'd the <HI>Turkish</HI> Empire.</P>
<P>After such a Conquest, whether might not the
Christian Religion have spread? The King of <HI>Spain</HI>
with the same Ease would reduce the Moors
of <HI>Barbary,</HI> and dispossess those Sons of Hell the
<PB N="251" REF="267"/>
<HI>Algerines, Tripolines, Tunizeens,</HI> and all the Maho∣metan
Pyrates of that Coast, and plant again
the antient Churches of <HI>Africk,</HI> the Sees of <HI>Tertulli∣an,</HI>
St. <HI>Cyprian, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, even the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> an enterprizing
and glorious Prince, well assisted and supported by
his Neighbours, the Northern Powers, who to∣gether
are Masters of the best Soldiery in the
World, would not find it impossible to march an
Army of 36000 Foot and 16000 Horse, in Spite
of waste and unhospitable Desarts, even to attack
the <HI>Chinese</HI> Empire; who, notwithstanding their
infinite Numbers, pretended Policy and great
Skill in War, would sink in the Operation: And
such an Army of disciplin'd <HI>European</HI> Soldiers,
would beat all the Forces of that vast Empire, with
the same (or greater) Ease, as <HI>Alexander</HI> with
30000 <HI>Macedonians</HI> destroy'd the Army of <HI>Darius,</HI>
which consisted of 680000 Men.</P>
<P>And let no Man ridicule this Project, on Ac∣count
of the March which I know they will call
3000 Miles and more: While there is no Obstru∣ction,
but the Length of the Way, it is not so
difficult as some may imagine; 'tis far from im∣possible,
to furnish sufficient Provisions for the
March, which is indeed the only Difficulty that
carries any Terror in it.</P>
<P>Such a Prince as the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy</HI> cannot
want the Assistance of innumerable Hands, for the
Amassing or Carriage for conveying to proper Ma∣gazines,
sufficient Stores of Provisions, for the
maintaining a select chosen Body of Men to march
over the Desarts; for in the grand March, no
useless Mouths should be found to feed.</P>
<P>Why then should not the Christian Princes think
it a Deed of Compassion to the Souls of Men, as
well as an humble Agency to the Work of Provi∣dence,
<PB N="252" REF="268"/>
and to the Fulfilling the Promises of their
Saviour, by a moderate, and as far as in them lyes,
a bloodless Conquest, to reduce the whole World
to the Government of Christian Power, and so
plant the Name and Knowledge of Christ Jesus
among the Heathens and Mahometans? I am not
supposing, that they can plant real Religion in
this manner; the Business of Power, is to open
the Way to the Gospel of Peace, the Servants of
the King of the Earth are to fight, that the Ser∣vants
of the King of Heaven may preach.</P>
<P>Let but an open Door be made for the preach∣ing
of the Word of God, and the Ministers of
Christ be admitted, if they do not spread Christi∣an
Knowledge over the Face of the Earth, the
Fault will be their's. Let but the military Power
reduce the Pagan World, and banish the Devil and
Mahomet from the Face of the Earth, the Know∣ledge
of God be diligently spread, the Word of God
duly preach'd, and the People meekly and faith∣fully
instructed in the Christian Religion; the
World would soon receive the Truth, and the
Knowledge of divine Things would be the Study
and Delight of Mankind.</P>
<P>I know, some nice and difficult People would
object here, how are the present Body of Christi∣ans,
<HI>as you call them,</HI> qualified to convert the Pa∣gan
and Mahometan World, when they are not
able to settle the main Point, <HI>viz.</HI> What the Chri∣stian
Religion is, Or, what they would convert
them to? That Christianity is subdivided into so
many Parts, and particular Principles, the People so
divided in their Opinion; and that which is still
worse, there is so little Charity among the several
Sorts, that some of them would rather side with
<HI>Mahomet</HI> against their Neighbours, than assist to pro∣pagate
that particular Doctrine in Religion, which
<PB N="253" REF="269"/>
they condemn. Thus the Members of the Prote∣stant
Faith would make it a Point of Principle,
not to supporr or propagate the Interest of Popery
in such a Conquest as this: And again, the Ca∣tholicks
would as much make it a Duty on
them to root out Heresy, so they call the Prote∣stant
<HI>Doctrine,</HI> as they would to root out Paganism
and the Worship of Devils.</P>
<P>I would not answer for some Protestants, that
they would not be of the same Mind as to particu∣lar
Divisions among Protestants: The Difference
among some Opinions is such, and their Want
of Charity one to another, sets them at such Va∣riance,
that if they do not censure one another for
Devil-Worshippers, yet we know they frequently
call some of the opposite Principles, Doctrines of
Devils; and persecute one another with as much
Fury, as ever the Heathen persecuted the Primi∣tive
Churches.</P>
<P>Witness the Violences which have reign'd be∣tween
the Episcopal and Presbyterian Parties, in the
North of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and in <HI>Scotland,</HI> which has so
often broken out into a Flame of War, and that
Flame been always quench'd with Blood.</P>
<P>Witness the frequent Persecutions, Wars, Mas∣sacres,
and other cruel and unnatural Doings,
which have been in these Parts of the World among
Christians, the Effect of a mistaken Zeal for the
Christian Religion; which as it was not planted
by Blood and Violence, so much less can Christi∣ans
justify the Endeavours to erect this or that
Opinion in it, by the Ruine and Blood of their
Brethren.</P>
<P>But this is far from being a Reason, why we
should not think it our Duty to subdue the barba∣rous
and idolatrous Nations of the World; in Or∣der
to suppress the Worshipping the Devil, who
<PB N="254" REF="270"/>
is the Enemy not only of God, and of all true Re∣ligion
in the World, but who is the great Destroy∣er
and Enemy of Mankind, and of his future or
present Felicity; and whose Business is always to
the utmost of his Power to involve and retain them
either in Ignorance, or in Error.</P>
<P>I distinguish between forcing Religion upon
People, or forcing them to entertain this or that
Opinion of Religion; I say, I distinguish between
that, and opening the Door for Religion to come
among them: The former is a Violence indeed,
inconsistent with the Nature of Religion it self,
whose Energy prevails and forces its Way into the
Minds of Men, by another Sort of Power; Where∣as
the latter is removing a Force unjustly put al∣ready
upon the Minds of Men by the Artifice of
the Devil, to keep the Christian Religion out of
the World; so that indeed I propose a War not
with Men, but with the Devil; a War to depose
<HI>Sathan</HI>'s infernal Tyranny in the World, and set
open the Doors to Religion, that it may enter if
Men will receive it; if they will not receive it,
be that to themselves.</P>
<P><HI>In a Word,</HI> to unchain the Wills of Men, set
their Inclinations free, that their Reason may be
at Liberty to influence their Understandings, and
that they may have the Faith of Christ preach'd
to them; whether they will hear or forbear, I say,
as above, is no Part of the Question, let the Chri∣stian
Doctrine and its spiritual Enemies alone to
struggle about that: I am for dealing with the
Tempora<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ities or the Devil, and deposing that hu∣man
Power which is armed in the Behalf of obsti∣nate
Ignorance, and resolute to keep out the Light
of Religion from the Mind.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="271"/>
I think this is a lawful and just War, and in the
End, kind both to them and their Posterity: Let me
bring the Case home to our selves.</P>
<P>Suppose neither <HI>Julius Cesar</HI> or any of the <HI>Ro∣man</HI>
Generals or Emperors, had cast their Eyes
towards <HI>Britain</HI> for some Ages, or till the Christian
Religion had spread over the whole <HI>Roman</HI> Em∣pire.
'Tis true, the <HI>Britains</HI> might at last have
received the Christian Faith in common with the
rest of the Northern World; but they had yet layn
above 300 Years longer in Ignorance and Paganism,
than they did; and some hundred thousands of
People, who prov'd zealous Christians, nay even
Martyrs for the Christian Doctrine, would have
dy'd in the profess'd Paganism of the <HI>Britains.</HI></P>
<P>Now 'tis evident, the Invasion of the <HI>Romans</HI>
was an unjust, bloody, tyrannical Assault upon the
poor <HI>Britains,</HI> against all Right and Property, against
Justice and Neighbourhood, and meerly carry'd
on for Conquest and Dominion. Nor indeed had
the <HI>Romans</HI> any just Pretence of War; yet God
was pleased to make this Violence be the kindest
Thing that could have befallen the <HI>British</HI> Nation,
since it brought in the Knowledge of God among
the <HI>Britains,</HI> and was a Means of reducing a hea∣then
and barbarous Nation to the Faith of Christ,
and to embrace the Messias.</P>
<P>Thus Heaven serves it self of Mens worst De∣signs,
and the Avarice, Ambition, and Rage of
Men, have been made Use of to bring to pass the
glorious Ends of Providence, without the least
Knowledge or Design of the Actors: Why then
may not the great Undertakings of the Princes of
<HI>Europe, if they could be brought to act in Concert,</HI> with
a good Design to bring all the World, to open their
Doors to the Christian Religion, and by Conse∣quence
their Ears? I say, why may not such an
<PB N="256" REF="272"/>
Attempt be blessed from Heaven with so much
Success, at least as to make Way for bringing in
nominal Christianity among the Nations? For as
to obliging the People to be of this or that Opini∣on
afterward, that is another Case.</P>
<P>There is a great Pother made in the World a∣mong
the several Denominations of Christians
about Coertion, erecting a Church, and compel∣ling
Men to come in; that is to say, one Sort of
Christians persecuting another Sort of Christians,
to make them worship Christ their Way, as if
Christ had no Sheep but one Fold.</P>
<P>I distinguish much between using Force to re∣duce
Heathens and Savages to Christianity, and
using Force to reduce those that are already Chri∣stians,
to be of this or that Opinion; I will not
say but a War might be very just, and the Cause
be righteous, to reduce the Worshippers of the Pa∣gods
of <HI>India,</HI> to the Knowledge and Obedience
of Christianity, when it would be a horrible In∣justice
to commence a like War, to reduce even
a Popish Nation to be Protestant.</P>
<P>But my propos'd War does not reach so far as
that neither; for tho' I would have a Nation of Pa∣gans
conquer'd, that their Idols and Temples
might be destroy'd, and their Idol Worship be
abolish'd; yet I would be very far from punishing
and persecuting the People for not believing in
Christ: For if we believe that Faith, as the Scrip∣ture
says is the Gift of God, How can we upon
any Christian Foundation, punish or persecute the
Man for not exercising that which God had not
given him.</P>
<P>Hence, compelling Men to conform to this
or that particular Profession of the Christian Re∣ligion,
is to me impious and unchristian.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="273"/>
And shall I speak a Word here of the unhap∣py
Custom among Christians, of reviling one
another with Words, on Account of differing O∣pinions
in Religion: It was a Part of <HI>Apocryphal</HI>
Scripture, taken from one of the traditional Say∣ings
of the Rabbies, <HI>Thou shalt not mock at the
Gods of the Heathens:</HI> But Ribaldry, Satyr, and
Sarcasms, are the Usage we give one another
every Day on the Subject of Religion; as if Slan∣der
and the Severities of the Tongue, were not the
worst kind of Violence in Matters of the Chri∣stian
Religion.</P>
<P>In a Word, I must acknowledge, if I am to
speak of Reproach in general, I know no worse
Persecution than that of the Tongue; <HI>Solomon</HI>
says, <HI>There are that speak, like the piercing of a Sword;</HI>
and King <HI>David</HI> was so sensible of the Bitterness
of the Tongue, that he is full of Exclamations
upon the Subject; among the rest, he says of his
Enemies, <HI>They have compassed me about with Words
of Hatred. He cloathed himself with Cursing like as
with his Garment,</HI> Psalm cix. 3, 18.</P>
<P>It is indeed remote from the Subject I am upon,
to talk of this kind of uncharitable Dealing, but
as just Observations are never out of Season, it
may have its Uses: Let no Man slight the Hint,
tho' it were meant of Religion only, for that indeed
is my present Subject; there is doubtless as severe
a Persecution by the Tongue, as that of Fire and
Faggot, and some think 'tis as hard to be born.</P>
<P>I have never met with so much of this any
where in all my Travels as in <HI>England,</HI> where the
Mouths of the several Sects and Opinions are so
effectually open against one another, that albeit
common Charity commands us to talk the best of
particular Persons in their Failings and Infirmi∣ties;
yet <HI>here,</HI> censuring, condemning and re∣proaching
<PB N="258" REF="274"/>
one another on Account of Opinions,
is carried on with such a Gust, that lets every one
see nothing but Death and Destruction can follow,
and no Reconciliation can be expected.</P>
<P>I have liv'd to see Men of the best Light be
mistaken, as well in Party as in Principles, as well
in Politicks as in Religion, and find not only Oc∣casion,
but even a Necessity to change Hands or
Sides in both; I have seen them sometimes run in∣to
contrary Extremes, beyond their first Inten∣tion,
and even without Design: Nay, in those un∣happy
Changes, I have seen them driven into
Lengths they never designed, by the fiery Re∣sentment
of those whom they seem'd to have
left, and whom they differ'd from; I have lived to
see those Men acknowledge even publickly and
openly, they were wrong and mistaken, and ex∣press
their Regret for being misled very sincerely;
but I cannot say, I have liv'd to see the People,
they have desir'd to return to, forgive or receive
them: Perhaps, the Age I have lived in, has not
been a proper Season for Charity, I hope Futurity
will be furnish'd with better Christians, or per∣haps
'tis appointed so, to illustrate the divine Mer∣cy,
and let Mankind see, that they are the only
Creatures that never forgive. I have seen a Man
in the Case I speak of, offer the most sincere Ac∣knowledgments
of his having been mistaken, and
this not in Matters essential either to the Person's
Morals or Christianity, but only in Matters of
Party, and with the most moving Expressions, de∣sire
his old Friends to forgive what has been
pass'd; and have seen their Return, be mocking
him with what they called a Baseness of Spirit,
and a mean Submission: I have seen him expostu∣late
with them, why they should not act upon
the same Terms with a Penitent, as God himself
<PB N="259" REF="275"/>
not only prescribed, but yields to; and have seen
them in Return, tell him, God might forgive him
if he pleased, but they would never; and then ex∣pose
all those Offers to the first Comer in Banter
and Ridicule: But take me right too, I have seen
at the same Time, that to wiser Men it has been
always thought to be an exposing themselves, and
an Honour to the Person.</P>
<P>I speak this <HI>too feelingly,</HI> and therefore say no
more; there is a Way by Patience, to conquer
even the universal Contempt of Mankind; and
though two Drams of that Drug be a Vomit
for a Dog, it is in my Experience the only Me∣thod;
there is a secret Peace in it, and in Time
the Rage of Men will abate, a constant steady
adhering to Vertue and Honesty, and shewing the
World, that whatever Mistakes he might be led
into, supposing them to be Mistakes, that yet the
main Intention and Design of his Life, was sin∣cere
and upright; he that governs the Actions of
Men by an unbiass'd Hand, will never suffer
such a Man to sink under the Weight of universal
Prejudice and Clamour.</P>
<P>I ROBINSON CRUSOE, grown old in Affli∣ction,
born down by Calumny and Reproach, but
supported from within, boldly prescribe this Re∣medy
against universal Clamours and Contempt of
Mankind; Patience, a steady Life of Vertue and
Sobriety, and a comforting Dependance on the
Justice of Providence, will first or last restore the
Patient to the Opinion of his Friends, and justify
him in the Face of his Enemies; and in the mean
time; will support him comfortably, in despising
those who want Manners and Charity, and leave
them to be cursed from Heaven with their own
Passions and Rage.</P>

This very Thought made me long ago claim
a kind of Property in some good old Lines of
the famous <HI>George Withers</HI> Es{que} made in Prison
in the <HI>Tower;</HI> he was a poetical Gentleman, who
had in the Time of the Civil Wars in <HI>England,</HI>
been unhappy in changing of Sides too often, and
and had been put into the <HI>Tower</HI> by every Side in
their Turn; once by the King, once by the Par∣liament,
once by the Army, then by the Rump,
and at last again, <HI>I think,</HI> by General <HI>Monk;</HI> in
a Word, what ever Side got up, he had the Dis∣aster
to be down, the Lines are thus:</P>
<LG>
<L>The World and I may well agree,</L>
<L>as most that are offended;</L>
<L>For I slight her, and she slights me,</L>
<L>and there's our Quarrel ended,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For Service done and love exprest,</L>
<L>Tho' very few regard it,</L>
<L>My Country owes me Bread at least:</L>
<L>But if I am debarr'd it,</L>
<L>Good Conscience is a daily Feast,</L>
<L>and Sorrow never marr'd it.</L>
</LG>
<P>But this Article of verbal Persecution, has
hurried me from my Subject, which I must re∣turn
to.</P>
<P>I have spoken of a Project for the Czar of <HI>Mus∣covy,</HI>
worthy of a Monarch, who is Lord of so
vast an extent of Country, as the <HI>Russian</HI> Empire
reaches to; which is in Effect as I have said,
much more than half <HI>Europe,</HI> and consequently an
eighth Part of the World. I have given my
Thoughts how a War to open a Door for the
<PB N="261" REF="277"/>
Christian Religion may be justifiable, and that it has
not the least Tincture of Persecution in it: If the
Christian Princes of the World, who now spend
their Force so much to an ill Purpose, in real Per∣secution,
would join in an universal War against
Paganism and Devil-worship, the savage Part
of Mankind would in one Age, be brought to
bow their Knees to the God of Truth, and would
bless the Enterprise it self in the End of it, as
the best Thing that ever befel them: Nor could
such an Attempt fail of Success, unless Heaven in
Justice had determined to shut up the World lon∣ger
in Darkness, and the Cup of their Abomina∣tions
was not yet full: But I may venture to say,
there would be much more Ground for such
Christian Princes to hope and expect the Con∣currence
of Heaven in such an Undertaking, than
in sheathing their Swords in the Bowels of
their Brethren, and making an Effusion of Chri∣stian
Blood upon every slight Pretence, as we see
has been the Case in <HI>Europe</HI> for above thirty Years
past.</P>
<P>I had intended to remark here, that as the
Country possessed by Christians is but a Spot of the
Globe, compared to the Heathen, Pagan, and
Mahometan World; so the Number of real Chri∣stians
among the Nations professing the Christian
Name, is yet a more disproportioned Part, a mere
Triflle, and hardly to be compar'd with the infi∣nite
Numbers of those who tho' they call themselves
Christians, yet know as little of God and Reli∣gion
as can be imagin'd to be known, where the
Word Christian is spoken of, and neither seek or
desire to know more; in a Word, who know but
little of God or Jesus Christ, Heaven or Hell, and
regard none of them.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="278"/>
This is a large Field and being througly search'd
into, would I doubt not, reduce the real faithful
Subjects of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, to a
much fewer Number than those of <HI>Mahomet;</HI> nay,
than those of the Monarch of <HI>Germany;</HI> and make
our Lord appear a weaker Prince, speaking in the
Sense of Kingdoms, than many of the King's of
the Earth. And if it be true that the old King
of <HI>France</HI> should say, That he had more loyal Sub∣jects
than King Jesus; I do not know, but in the
Sense his Most Christian Majesty meant it, the
Thing might be very true.</P>
<P>But this Observation is something out of my
present Road, and merits to be spoken of by itself.
The Number of true Christians will never be
known on this Side the great Bar, where they
shall be critically separated. No political Arith∣metick
can make a Calculation of the Number
of true Christians, while they live blended with
the false ores, since it is not only hard, but im∣possible
to know them one from another in this
World.</P>
<P>We shall perhaps be surprised at the last Day, to
see some People at the Right-hand of the righ∣teous
Judge, whom we have condemned with
the utmost Zeal in our Opinions, while we were
Contemporary with them in Life; for Charity,
as it is generally practised in this World, and
mix'd with our human Infirmities, such as Pride,
Self-opinion, and Personal-prejudice, is strangely
mis-guided, and makes us entertain Notions of
Things and of People, quite different from what
they really deserve; and there is hardly any Rule
to prescribe ourselves, except it be of the Text,
<HI>In Meekness, every one esteeming other better than
themselves,</HI> which by the Way, is difficult to
do.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="279"/>
But though we shall thus see at the great <HI>Au∣dit,</HI>
a Transposition of Persons from the Station
they held in our Charity, we shall only thereby
see that our Judgment was wrong; that God
judgeth not as Man judgeth, and that we too
rashly condemn, whom he has thought fit to ju∣stify
and accept.</P>
<P>Let then the Number of Christians be more or
less, as he that makes them Christians determines,
this is not for us to enter into, and this brings
me back to what I said before, that though we
cannot make Christians, we both can and may, and
indeed ought to open the Door to Christianity,
that the Preaching of God's Word, which is the
ordinary Means of bringing Mankind to the Know∣ledge
of Religion, may be spread over the whole
World.</P>
<P>With what Vigour do we consult, and how do
the labouring Heads of the World club together
to form Projects, and to raise Subscriptions to
extend the general Commerce of Nations in∣to
every Corner of the World: But 'twould
pass for a Bubble of all Bubbles, and a Whimsy
that none would engage in, if ten Millions should
be asked to be subscribed, for sending a strong
Fleet and Army to conquer Heathenism and Ido∣latry,
and protect a Mission of Christians, to be
employ'd in Preaching the Gospel to the poor
Heathens, say it were on the Coast of <HI>Cormandel,</HI>
the Island of <HI>Ceylon</HI> and Country of <HI>Malabar,</HI> or
any of the Dominions of the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> and
yet such an Attempt would not only be just, but
infinitely advantageous to the People who should
undertake it, and to the People of the Country,
on whom the Operation should be wrought.</P>
<P>In the occasional Discourses I had on this Subject,
in Conversation with Men of good Judg∣ment
<PB N="264" REF="280"/>
and Principles, I have been often ask'd
in what Manner I would propose to carry on such
a Conquest as I speak of, and how it should an∣swer
the End; and that I may not be supposed to
suggest a Thing impracticable in itself or for
which no rational Scheme might be proposed, I
shall make a brief Essay, at the Manner, in which
the Conquest I speak of should be, or ought to be
carried on; and if it be considered seriously, the
Difficulties and perhaps all the reasonable Ob∣jections
might vanish in an Instant. I will there∣fore
first, <HI>for the Purpose only,</HI> suppose that an At∣tempt
was made by a Christian Nation, to con∣quer
and subdue some Heathen or <HI>Mahometan</HI> Peo∣ple
at a Distance from them, place the Conquest
where, and among whom we will: For Example,
Suppose it was the great Island of <HI>Madagascar,</HI> or
that of <HI>Ceylon, Borneo</HI> in the <HI>Indies,</HI> or those of
<HI>Japan,</HI> or any other where you please.</P>
<P>I would first suppose, the Place to be infinite∣ly
populous as any of those Countries, though
they are Islands, are said to be; and because the
<HI>Japonnese</HI> are said to be a most sensible sagacious
People, under excellent Forms of Government,
and capable more than ordinarily of receiving
Impressions, supported by the Argument and Ex∣ample
of a vertuous and religious Conqueror.</P>
<P>For this Purpose you must grant me, that the
Island or Islands of <HI>Japan</HI> were in a Situation
proper for the undertaking, and that a powerful
<HI>European</HI> Army being landed upon them, had in a
great Battle or in divers Battles, over-thrown
all their Military Force, and had entirely re∣duced
the whole Nation to their Power: As to
go back to Examples, the <HI>Venetians</HI> had done by
the <HI>Turks</HI> in the <HI>Morea</HI> in a former War, or as
The <HI>Turks</HI> did in the Isles of <HI>Candia, Cyprus,</HI> and
<PB N="265" REF="281"/>
the like. The short Scheme for establishing the
Government in those Countries should be this;
<LIST>
<ITEM>First, As the War is pointed chiefly a∣gainst
the Kingdom of the Devil, in
behalf of the Christian Worship, so
no Quarter should be given to Satan's
Administration; and as nothing else
should willingly be treated with Vio∣lence;
so indeed no Part of the De∣vils
O Economy should have any Fa∣vour,
but all the Idols should imme∣diately
be destroyed, and publickly
burnt, all the Pagods and Temples
burnt, and the very Face and Form
of Paganism and the Worship attend∣ing
it, be utterly defaced and de∣stroyed.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Secondly, The Priests and dedicated Per∣sons
of every kind, by whatsoever
Names or Titles known or distin∣guished,
should be at le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st removed,
if not destroyed.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Thirdly, All the Exercise of profane and
idolatrous Rites, Ceremonies, Wor∣ship,
Festivals, and Customs, should
be abolished entirely, so as by Time
to be forgotten, and clean wiped out
of the Minds, as well as out of the
Practice of the People.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>This is all the Coertion I propose, and less than
this cannot be proposed, because though we may
not by Arms and Force compel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Men to be reli∣gious,
because if we do, we cannot make them
<PB N="266" REF="282"/>
sincere, and so by Persecution we only create Hy∣pocrites;
yet I insist that we may by Force,
and that with the greatest Justice possible, sup∣press
Paganism, and the Worship of God's Enemy
the Devil, and banish it out of the World; nay,
that we ought to do it to the utmost of our Power:
But I return to the Conquest.</P>
<P>The Country being thus entirely reduced under
Christian Government, the Inhabitants if they
submit quietly, ought to be used with Humanity
and Justice; no Cruelty, no Rigour; they should
suffer no Oppression, Injury, or Injustice, that
they may not receive evil Impressions of the Peo∣ple
that are come among them; lest entertaining an
Abhorrence of Christians, from their evil Conduct,
Cruelty, and Injustice, they should entertain an Ab∣horrence
of the Christian Religion for their Sakes;
as the poor Wretches the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> who
when they were talked to of the Future State,
the Resurrection of the Dead, Eternal Felicity in
Heaven, and the like, enquir'd where the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
went after Death, and if any of them went to
Heaven? and being answered in the Affirmative,
shook their Heads, and desired they might go to
Hell then, for that they were afraid to think of
being in Heaven, if the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were there.</P>
<P>A just and generous Behaviour to the Natives,
or at least to such of them as should show them∣selves
willing to submit, would certainly engage
them in their Interest, and accordingly would in
a little while bring them to embrace that Truth,
which dictated such just Principles to those who
espoused it.</P>
<P>Thus Prejudices being removed, the Way to In∣struction
would be made the more plain, and then
would be the Time for Gospel-Labourers to enter
upon the Harvest; Ministers should be instructed
<PB N="267" REF="283"/>
to teach them our Language, to exhort them to
seek the Blessings of Religion and of the true
God, and so gradually to introduce right Prin∣ples
among them at their own Request.</P>
<P>From hence they should proceed, to teach all
the young Children the Language spoken by them,
who would then be their Benefactors, rather than
Conquerors, and a few Years wearing the old Ge∣neration
out, the Posterity of them, and of their
Conquerors, would be all one Nation.</P>
<P>In Case any rejected the Instruction of religious
Men, and adher'd obstinately to his Idolatry, and
would not be reclaimed by gentle and christian U∣sage,
suitable Methods are to be taken with such,
that they might not make a religious Faction in the
Country, and gain others to side with them, in
older to recover their Liberty, as they might call it
to serve their own Gods, that is to say Idols; for
it must be for ever as just, not to permit them to go
back to Idolatry by Force, as it was to pull
them from it by Force.</P>
<P>By this kind of Conquest, the Christian Reli∣gion
would be most effectually propagated among
innumerable Nations of Savages and Idola∣ters,
and as many People be brought to worship
the true God, as may be said to do it at this Time
in the whole Christian World.</P>
<P>This is my <HI>Cruisado,</HI> and it would be a War as
justifiable on many Accounts, as any that was ever
undertaken in the World, a War that would bring
Eternal Honour to the Conquerors, and an Eternal
Blessing to the People conquer'd.</P>
<P>It were easy now to cut out Enterprises of this
Nature for other of the Princes of the World than
the Czar of <HI>Muscovy;</HI> and I could lay very ratio∣nal
Schemes for such Undertakings, and the
Schemes that could, if througly pursued never
<PB N="268" REF="284"/>
fail of Success: For Example, An Expedition
against the <HI>Moors</HI> of <HI>Africa,</HI> by the <HI>French, Spanish</HI>
and <HI>Italian</HI> Princes, who daily suffer so much by
them, and the last of whom are at perpetual War
with them; how easy would it be to those
Powers to join in a Christian Confederacy, to
plant the Christian Religion again in the <HI>Numi∣dian</HI>
and <HI>Mauritanian</HI> Kingdoms; where was once
the famous Church of <HI>Carthage,</HI> and from whence
Thousands of Christians have gone to Heaven;
the Harvest of the primitive Labours of St. <HI>Cy∣prian,
Tertullian,</HI> and many more, whose Poste∣rity
now bow their Knees to that latest and worst
of all Impostors, <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P>But unchristian Strife was always a Bar against
the Propagation of Christian Religion, and unna∣tural
Wars carried on among the Nations I speak
of, are made so much the Business of the Christian
World, that I do not expect in our Time, to see
the Advantages taken hold of, that the Nature of
the Thing offers: But I am persuaded, and leave it
upon Record as my settled Opinion, that one
Time or other, the Christian Powers of <HI>Europe,</HI>
shall be inspired from Heaven for such a Work,
and then the Easiness of subduing the Kingdom of
<HI>Africa</HI> to the Christian Power, shall shame the Ge∣nerations
past, who had the Opportunity so often
in their Hands, but made no Use of it.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> In this Part of the Subject I am upon, I
must acknowledge there is a double Argument
for a War: 1. In Point of the interfering Interests,
<HI>Europe</HI> ought to take Possession of those Shoars,
without which it is manifest her Commerce is not
secured; and indeed, while that Part of <HI>Africk</HI>
bordering on the Sea, is in the Hands of Robbers,
Pyrates cannot be secur'd: Now, this is a Point
of undisputed Right, for a War-Trade claims the
<PB N="269" REF="285"/>
Protection of the Powers to whom it belongs, and
we make no Scruple to make War upon one ano∣ther,
for the Protection of our Trade, and it is
allowed to be a good Reason why we should do
so. Why then is it not a good Reason to make
War upon Thieves and Robbers? If one Nation
takes the Ships belonging to another, we imme∣diately
reclaim the Prize from the Captors, and
require of the Prince, that Justice be done against
the Aggressor, who is a Breaker of the Peace;
and it this is refused, we make War.</P>
<P>But shall we do thus to Christians, and scruple
to make an universal War for the rooting out a
Race of Pyrates and Rovers who live by Rapin,
and are continually employed like the Lions and
Tygers of their own <HI>Lybia</HI> in devouring their
Neighbours: This, I say, makes such a War not
only just on a religious Account, but both just
and necessary upon a civil Account.</P>
<P>The War then being thus proved to be just on
other Accounts, why should not 2. The Extir∣pation
of Idolatry, Paganism, and Devil-Worship,
be the Consequence of the Victory. If God be
allow'd to be the Giver of Victory, how can it
be answered to him, that the Victory should not
be made Use of, for the Interest and Glory of
the God of War, from whom it proceeds? But
these Things are not to be offered to the World,
till higher Principles work in the Minds of Men,
in their making War and Peace, than yet seems to
take up their Minds.</P>
<P>I was tempted upon this Occasion, to make an
Excursion here, upon the Subject of the very
light Occasions, Princes and Powers, States and
Statesmen make use of, for the engaging in War
and Blood one against another; one for being ill
satisfied with the other, and another for preserving
<PB N="270" REF="286"/>
the Ballance of Power; this for nothing at all,
and that for something next to nothing; and how
little Concern the Blood that is necessarily spilt
in these Wars produces among them: But this is
not a Case that will so well bear, to be entred
upon in a publick Manner at this Time.</P>
<P>All I can add is, I doubt, no such Zeal for the
Christian Religion, will be found in our Days, or
perhaps in any Age of the World, till Heaven beats
the Drums itself, and the glorious Legions from above
come down on Purpose to propagate the Work, and
to reduce the whole World to the Obedience of
King <HI>Jesus;</HI> a Time which some tell us is not far
off: But of which I heard nothing in all my Travels
and Illuminations, <HI>no not one Word.</HI></P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HEY must be much taken up
with the Satisfaction of what
they are already, that never spare
their Thoughts upon the Subject
of what they shall be.</P>
<P>The Place, the Company, the
Employment which we expect to
know so much of hereafter, must certainly be well
worth our while to enquire after here.</P>
<P>I believe the main Interruptions which have
been given to these Enquiries, and perhaps, the
Reason why those that have entred into them
<PB N="2" REF="288"/>
have given them up, and those who have not
entred into them, have satisfied themselves in the
utter Neglect, have been the wild chimerick
Notions, enthusiastick Dreams, and unsatisfying
Ideas, which most of the Conceptions of Men
have led them into, about these Things.</P>
<P>As I endeavour to conceive justly of these
Things, I shall likewise endeavour to reason upon
them clearly, and, if possible, convey some such
Ideas of the invisible World to the Thoughts of
Men, as may not be confused and indigested, and
so leave them darker than I find them.</P>
<P>The Locality of Heaven or Hell is no Part of
my Search; there is doubtless a Place reserv'd
for the Reception of our Souls after Death; as
there is a State of Being for material Substances,
so there must be a Place; if we are to BE, we
must have <HI>a where;</HI> the Scripture supports Rea∣son
in it, <HI>Judas</HI> is gone to his Place, <HI>Dives</HI> in
Hell lift up his Eyes, and saw <HI>Lazarus</HI> in <HI>Abra∣ham</HI>'s
Bosom; the Locality of Bliss and Misery
seems to be positively asserted in both Cases.</P>
<P>But there is not so clear a View of the Company
as of the Place; it is not so easy to enquire into
the World of Spirits, as it is evident that there
are such Spirits, and such a World; we find the
Locality of it is natural, but who the Inhabitants
are, is a Search of still a sublimer Nature, liable
to more Exception, encumber'd with more Dif∣ficulties,
and exposed to much more Uncertainty.</P>
<P>I shall endeavour to clear up as much of it as
I can, and intimate most willingly, how much I
rejoyce in the Expectation, that some other En∣quirers
may go farther, 'till at last, all that Pro∣vidence
has thought fit to discover of that Part
may be perfectly known.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="289"/>
The Discoveries in the Scripture which lead
to this, are innumerable; but the positive Decla∣ration
of it seems to be declin'd. When our Sa∣viour
walking on the Sea frighted his Disciples,
and they cried out, what do we find terrify'd
them? Truly, they thought they had seen a Spi∣rit.
One would have thought such Men as they,
who had the Vision of <HI>God manifest in the Flesh,</HI>
should not have been so much surpriz'd, if they
had seen a Spirit, that is to say, <HI>seen an Apparition;</HI>
for to see a Spirit, seems to be an Allusion, not
an Expression to be us'd literally, a Spirit being
not visible by the Organ of human Sight.</P>
<P>But what if it had been a Spirit? if it had
been a good Spirit, what had they to fear? And
if a bad Spirit, what would <HI>crying out</HI> have as∣sisted
them? When People cry out in such Cases,
it is either for Help, and then they cry to others;
or for Mercy, and then they cry to the Subject
of their Terror to spare them. Either Way it
was either the foolishest, or the wickedest Thing
that ever was done by such grave Men as the
Apostles; for if it was a good Spirit, as before;
they had no Need to cry out; and if it was a bad
one, who did they cry to? For 'tis evident they
did not pray to God, or cross and bless them∣selves,
as was afterwards the Fashion; but they
<HI>cried out,</HI> that is to say, they either cried out for
Help, which was great Nonsense, to call to Man
for Help against the Devil; or they cried to the
Spirit they saw, that it might not hurt them,
which was, in short, neither less, or more, than
praying to the Devil.</P>
<P>This put me in Mind of the poor Savages in
many of the Countries of <HI>America</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> who
really instructed by their Fear, that is to say, by
meer Nature, worship the Devil, that he may not
hurt them.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="290"/>
Here I must digress a little, and make a Tran∣sition
from the Story of a Spirit, to the strange
Absurdities of Mens Notions at that Time; and
particularly, of those upon whom the first Im∣pressions
of Christ's Preachings were wrought,
and if it be look'd narrowly into, one cannot but
wonder what strange ignorant People, even the
Disciples themselves were, at first; and indeed
their Ignorance continued a great while, even
to after the Death of Christ himself; witness the
foolish Talk of the two Disciples going to <HI>Emans.</HI>
It is true they were wiser afterwards when they
were better taught; but the Scripture is full of
the Discoveries of their Ignorance; as in the No∣tions
of sitting at his Right-hand and his Left, in
his Kingdom, ask'd for by <HI>Zebedee</HI>'s Children; no
doubt but the good Woman their Mother thought
one of her Sons should be Lord Treasurer there,
and the t'other Lord Chancellor, and she could
not but think those Places their Due, when she
saw them in such Favour with him here. Just so
in their Notion of seeing a Spirit here, which
put them into such a Fright, and indeed they
might be said, according to our dull Way of
Talking, to be frighted out of their Wits; For
had their Senses been in Exercise, they would ei∣ther
have rejoic'd in the Appearance of a good
Angel, and stood still to hear his Message, as
from Heaven; or pray'd to God to deliver them
out of the Hands of the Devil, on their supposing
it, as above, to be a Vision from Hell.</P>
<P>But I come to the Subject. It is evident that
the Notion of Spirits, and their intermeddling
with the Affairs of Men, and even of their ap∣pearing
to Men, prevail'd fo universally in those
Ages of the World, that even God's own People,
who were instructed from himself, believ'd it,
<PB N="5" REF="291"/>
nor is there any Thing in all the Old Testament
Institution to contradict it, tho' many Things
to confirm it; such particularly, as the Law
against what is call'd a familiar Spirit, which
was esteem'd no better or worse than a conver∣sing
with the Devil, that is to say, with some
of the evil Spirits of the World I speak of.</P>
<P>The Witch of <HI>Endor,</HI> and the Story of an Ap∣parition
of an old Man personating <HI>Samuel,</HI> which
is so plainly asserted in Scripture, and which the
learned Opposers of these Notions have spent so
much weak Pains to disturb our Imaginations
about, yet assure us, that such Apparitions are
not inconsistent with Nature, or with Religion;
nay, the Scripture allows this Woman to <HI>Paw waw,</HI>
as the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>America</HI> call it, and conjure for
the raising this Spectre, and when it is come, al∣lows
it to speak a great prophetick Truth, fore∣telling
the King in all its terrible Particulars what
was to happen to him, and what did befal him
the very next Day.</P>
<P>Either this Appearance must be a good Spirit,
or a bad; if it was a good Spirit, it was an
Angel, as it is express'd in another Place of the
Apostle <HI>Peter,</HI> when he knock'd at the good
People's Door in <HI>Jerusalem, Acts</HI> xii. 15. and then it
supports my Opinion of the Spirits unembodied
conversing with, and taking Care of the Spirits
embodied; if it was an evil Spirit, then they
must grant God to be making a Prophet of the
Devil, and making him personate <HI>Samuel</HI> to foretel
Things to come; permitting Sathan to speak in the
first Person of God's own Prophet, and indeed to
preach the Justice of God's Dealing with <HI>Saul,</HI> for
rejecting his Prophet <HI>Samuel;</HI> which in short, is not
a little odd, putting the Spirit of God into the
<PB N="6" REF="292"/>
Mouth of the Devil, and making Sathan a
Preacher of Righteousness.</P>
<P>When I was in my Retirement, I had a∣bundance
of strange Notions of my seeing Ap∣paritions
there, and especially when I hap∣pen'd
to be abroad by Moon-shine, when every
Bush look'd like a Man, and every Tree like a
Man on Horse-back; and I so prepossess'd my
self with it, that I scarce durst look behind me
for a good while, and after that durst not go a∣broad
at all at Night; nay, it grew upon me to
such a Degree at last, that I as firmly believ'd I
saw several Times real Shapes and Appearances,
as I do now really believe and am assur'd, that it
was all Hypochondriack Delusion.</P>
<P>But however, that the Reader may see how
far the Power of Imagination may go, and judge
for me whether I shew'd any more Folly and Sim∣plicity
than other Men might do, I'll repeat some
little Passages, which for a while gave me very
great Disturbances, and every one shall judge for
me, whether they might not have been deluded in
the like Circumstances as well as I.</P>
<P>The first Case was, when I crept into the dark
Cave in the Valley, where the old Goat lay just
expiring, which, wherever it happen'd, is a true
History, I assure you.</P>
<P>When first I was stopp'd by the Noise of this
poor dying Creature, you are to observe, that
the Voice was not only like the Voice of a Man,
but even articulate, only that I could not form
any Words from it; and what did that amount to
more or less than this, namely, that it spoke,
but only it was in a Language that I did not un∣derstand.
If it was possible to describe the Sur∣prise
of my Spirits on that Occasion, I would do
it here; how all my Blood run, <HI>or rather stood still,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="293"/>
chill'd in my Veins; how a cold Dew of Sweat
sat on my Forehead; how my Joints, like <HI>Belshaz∣zar</HI>'s
Knees, shook one against another; and how,
as I said, my Hair would have lifted off my Hat,
if I had had one on my Head.</P>
<P>But this is not all. After the first Noise of the
Creature which was a faint dying Kind of imper∣fect
Bleating, not unusual, as I found afterward; I
say, after this, he fetch'd two or three deep Sighs
as lively, and as like human, as it is possible to
imagine, as I have also said.</P>
<P>These were so many Confirmations of my Sur∣prize,
besides the Sight of his two glaring Eyes,
and carried it up to the Extreme of Fright and
Amazement; how I afterwards conquered this
childish Beginning, and muster'd up Courage e∣nough
to go into the Place with a Fire brand for
Light; and how I was presently satisfy'd with
seeing the Creature whose Condition made all the
little accidental Noises appear rational, I have
already said.</P>
<P>But I must acknowledge, that this real Surprize
left some Relicks or Remains behind it, that did
not wear quite off a great while, tho' Istruggl'd hard
with them: The Vapours that were rais'd at first
were never so laid, but that on every trifling Oc∣casion
they return'd; and I saw, nay, I felt Ap∣paritions,
as plainly and distinctly as ever I felt
or saw any real Substance in my Life.</P>
<P>The like was the Case with me before that,
when I first found the Print of a Man's Foot up∣on
the Sand, by the Seaside on the North Part of
the Island.</P>
<P>And these, I say, having left my Fancy a little
peevish and wayward, I had frequently some Re∣turns
of these Vapours on differing Occasions,
and sometimes even without Occasion; nothing
<PB N="8" REF="294"/>
but meer Hypochondriack Whimsies, fluttering of
the Blood, and rising of Vapours, which nobody
could give any Account of but myself.</P>
<P><HI>For Example:</HI> It was one Night, after my having
seen some odd Appearances in the Air, of no great
Significance, that coming home and being in Bed,
but not asleep, I felt a Pain in one of my Feet; af∣ter
which it came to a kind of Numb'dness in my
Foot, which a little surpriz'd me, and after that, a
kind of Tingling in my Blood, as if it had been
some Distemper running up my Leg.</P>
<P>On a sudden I felt, as it were, something alive
lye upon me, as if it had been a Dog lying up∣on
my Bed, from my Knee downwards about half
Way my Leg, and immediately afterwards I felt
it heavier, and felt it as plainly roll itself upon me
upwards upon my Thigh, for I lay on one Side;
I say, as if it had been a Creature lying upon me
with all his Weight, and turning his Body upon
me.</P>
<P>It was so lively and sensible to me, and I re∣member
it so perfectly well, though it is now
many Years ago, that my Blood chills and flutters
about my Heart at the very writing it. I imme∣diately
flung my self out of my Bed, and flew to
my Musquet, which stood always ready at my
Hand, and, naked as I was, laid about me upon
the Bed in the dark, and every where else that I
could think of where any Body might stand or lye,
but could find nothing. <HI>Lord deliver me from an
evil Spirit,</HI> said I! <HI>What can this be?</HI> And being
tired with groping about, and having broke two
or three of my Earthen Pots with making Blows
here and there to no Purpose, I went to light my
Candle, for my Lamp which I us'd to burn in the
Night, either had not been lighted, or was gone
out.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="295"/>
When I lighted a Candle, I could easily see
there was no living Creature in the Place with
me, but the poor Parrot, who was wak'd and
frighted, and cry'd out, <HI>Hold your Tongue,</HI> and,
<HI>What's the Matter with you?</HI> Which Words he
learn'd of me, from my frequent saying so to him,
when he used to make his ordinary wild Noise and
Screaming that I did not like.</P>
<P>The more I was satisfy'd that there was nothing
in the Room, at least to be seen, the more another
Concern came upon me. Lord! <HI>says I aloud,</HI> this
is the Devil. <HI>Hold your Tongue,</HI> says Poll. I was
so mad at the Bird, tho' the Creature knew no∣thing
of the Matter, that if he had hung near
me, I believe I should have killed him. I put my
Clothes on, and sat me down, for I could not find
in my Heart to go to Bed again; and as I sat
down, <HI>I am terribly frighted,</HI> said I. <HI>What's the
Matter with you?</HI> says Poll. You Toad, <HI>said I,</HI> I'd
knock your Brains out if you were here. <HI>Hold your
Tongue,</HI> says he again, and then fell to chattering,
<HI>Robin Crusoe,</HI> and, <HI>Poor Robin Crusoe,</HI> as he us'd
to do.</P>
<P>Had I been in any Reach of a good Temper, it
had been enough to have composed me; but I
was quite gone, I was fully possess'd with a Belief,
that it was the Devil, and I pray'd most heartily
to God, to be delivered from the Power of the
evil Spirit.</P>
<P>After some Time, I composed my self a little,
and went to Bed again, and lying just in the Po∣sture
as I was in before, I felt a little of the Ting∣ling
in my Blood which I felt before, and I re∣solv'd
to lye still, let it be what it would; it
came up as high as my Knee, as before, but no
higher; and now I began to see plainly that it was
all a Distemper, that it was something Paralitick,
<PB N="10" REF="296"/>
and that affected the Nerves; but I had not ei∣ther
Experience of such a thing, or Knowledge
of Diseases, enough to be fully satisfy'd of the Na∣ture
of them, and whether any thing natural, any
Numbedness or Dead Palsie affecting one Part of
The Thigh, could feel as that did; till some Months
after that, I felt something of the very same again
at my first lying down in my Bed for three or four
Nights together, which at first gave me a little Con∣cern
as a Distemper, but at last gave me such Sa∣tisfaction,
that the first was nothing but the same
thing in a higher Degree; that the Pleasure of
knowing it was only a Disease, was far beyond the
Concern at the Danger of it; Tho' a dead Palsie
to one in my Condition might reasonably have been
one of the most frightful Things in Nature; since
having no body to help me, I must have inevitably
perish'd for meer Want of Food, not being able to
go from Place to Place to fetch it.</P>
<P>But to go back to the Case in Hand, and to
the Apprehension I had been in; all the several
Months that pass'd between the first of this and
the last, I went about with a melancholy heavy
Heart, fully satisfy'd that the Devil had been in
my Room, and lay upon my Bed.</P>
<P>Sometimes I would trye to argue my self a little
out of it, asking my self, Whether it was reason∣able
to imagine the Devil had nothing else to do
than to come thither, and only lye down upon
me, and go away about his Business, and say not
one Word to me? What End it could answer? and
whether I thought the Devil was really busy'd
about such Trifles? Or whether he had not Em∣ployment
enough of a higher Nature, so that such
a Thing as that could be worth his while?</P>
<P>But still then I was answer'd with my own
Thoughts, returning thus, What could it be? Or,
<PB N="11" REF="297"/>
if it was not a Devil, what was it? This I could
not answer by any Means at all; and so I still sunk
under the Belief, that it was the Devil, and no∣thing
but the Devil.</P>
<P>You may be sure, while I had this Fancy in my
Head, I was of Course over-run with the Vapours,
and had all the Hypochondriack Fancies that ever
any melancholy Head could entertain; and what
with ruminating on the Print of a Foot upon the
Sand, and the Weight of the Devil upon me in my
Bed, I made no Difficulty to conclude, that the Old
Gentleman really visited the Place; and in a Word,
it had been easy to have possess'd me, if I had con∣tinued
so much longer, that it was an enchanted
Island, that there were a Million of evil Spirits in
it, and that the Devil was Lord of the Manor.</P>
<P>I scarce heard the least Noise, near or far off,
but I started, and expected to see a Devil; every
distant Bush upon a Hill, if I did not particularly
remember it before, was a Man, and every Stump
an Apparition; and I scarce went twenty Yards
together by Night or by Day, without looking
behind me.</P>
<P>Sometimes indeed I took a little Heart, and
would say <HI>well,</HI> let it be <HI>the Devil</HI> if it will, <HI>God</HI>
is Master of <HI>the Devil,</HI> and he can do me no Hurt,
unless he is permitted; he can be no where, but
he that made him is there too; and as I said after∣wards,
when I was frighted with the old Goat
in a Cave, he is not fit to live all alone in such an
Island for 20 Years that would be afraid to see the
Devil.</P>
<P>But all these Things lasted but a short while,
and the Vapours that were raised at first, were not
to be laid so easily; for, in a Word, it was not
meer Imagination, but it was the Imagination
ras'd up to Disease: Nor did it ever quite wear
<PB N="12" REF="298"/>
off till I got my Man <HI>Fryday</HI> with me, of whom
I have said so much; and then having Company
to talk to, the Hypo wore off, and I did not see
any more Devils after that.</P>
<P>Before I leave this Part, I cannot but give a Cau∣tion
to all vapourish melancholy People, whose I∣maginations
run this Way; I mean, about seeing
she Devil, Apparitions, and the like; namely, that
they should never look behind them, and over their
Shoulders as they go up Stairs, or look into the
Corners and Holes of Rooms with a Candle in
their Hands, or turn about to see who may be be∣hind
them in any Walks or dark Fields, Lanes, or
the like; for let such know, they will see the Devil
whether he be there or no; nay, they will be so
perswaded, that they do see him, that their very
Imagination will be a Devil to them where-ever
they go.</P>
<P>But after all this is said, let nobody suggest,
that because the brain-sick Fancy, the vapourish
Hypochondriack Imagination represents Spectres
and Spirits to us, and makes Apparitions for us,
that therefore there are no such Things as Spirits
both good and evil, any more than we should con∣ceive
that there is no Devil, because we do not
see him.</P>
<P>The Devil has Witnesses of his Being and Na∣ture,
just as God himself has of his; they are not
indeed so visible or so numerous, but we are all
able to bring Evidence of the Existence of the
Devil from our own Frailties, as we are to bring
Evidence of the Existence of God from the Facul∣ties
of our Souls, and from the Contexture of our
Bodies.</P>
<P>As our Propensity to Evil rather than Good, is
a Testimony of the original Depravity of human
Nature; so the Harmony between the Inclination
<PB N="13" REF="299"/>
and the Occasion, is a Testimony which leaves
the Presence of the evil Spirit with us out of Que∣stion.</P>
<P>Not that the Devil is always the Agent in our
Temptations; for tho' the Devil is a very dili∣gent
Fellow, and always appears ready to fall
in with the Allurement, yet the Scripture clears
him, and we must do so too, of being the main
Tempter; 'tis our own corrupt debauch'd In∣clination
which is the first moving Agent; and
therefore the Scripture says, <HI>A Man is tempted,
when he is drawn away of his own Lusts, and enticed.</HI>
The Devil who, as I said, is a very diligent Fel∣low
in the infernal Work, and is always ready to
forward the Mischief, is also a very cunning
Fellow, and knows how most dextrously to suit
alluring Objects to the allurable Dispositions; to
procure ensnaring Things, and lay them in the
Way of the Man whom he finds so easy to be en∣snar'd,
and he never fails to prompt all the Mis∣chief
he can, full of Stratagem and Art to en∣snare
us by the Help of our corrupt Affections,
and these are call'd <HI>Sathan's Devices.</HI></P>
<P>But having charg'd Sathan home in that Part,
I must do the Devil that Justice, as to own, that
he is the most slander'd, most abus'd Creature
alive; Thousands of Crimes we lay to his Charge
that he is not guilty of; Thousands of our own
Infirmities we load him with which he has no
Hand in; and Thousands of our Sins, which, as
bad as he is, he knows nothing of; calling him
our Tempter, and pretending we did so and so,
as the Devil would have it, when on the contrary
the Devil had no Share in it, and we were only
<HI>led away of our own Lusts, and enticed.</HI></P>
<P>But now, having made this Digression in the
Devil's Defence, I return to the main Question, that
<PB N="14" REF="300"/>
of the Being of the Devil, and of evil Spirits; this,
I believe, there is no Room to doubt of; but this,
as I have observ'd, is not the Thing; these are
not the Spirits I am speaking of, but I shall come
directly to what I mean, and speak plain without
any Possibility of being misunderstood.</P>
<P>I make no Question, but that there is not only
a World of Spirits, but that there is a certain
Knowledge of it, tho' to us impossible as to the
Manner of it; there is a certain Converse between
the World of Spirits, and the Spirits in this
World; that is to say, between Spirits uncased or
unembody'd, and Souls of Men embody'd or cased
up in Flesh and Blood, as we all are on this side Death.</P>
<P>It is true, that we cannot describe this Con∣verse
of Spirits, as to the Way of it, the Manner
of the Communication, or how things are mutu∣ally
convey'd from one to another. How Intelli∣gences
are given or receiv'd we know not; we
know but little of their being convey'd <HI>this Way,</HI>
from the Spirits unembody'd, to ours that are in
Life; and of their being convey'd <HI>that Way,</HI> name∣ly,
from us to them; of that we know nothing▪
The latter certainly is done without the Help of
the Organ, the former is convey'd by the Under∣standing,
and the retir'd Faculties of the Soul, of
which we can give very little Account.</P>
<Q>For Spirits, without the help of Voice, converse.</Q>
<P>Let me, however, give, as Reasons for my Opi∣nion,
some Account of the Consequences of this
Converse of Spirits; I mean such as are quite re∣mote
from what we call Apparition or Appearance
of Spirits; and I omit these, because I know they
are objected much against, and they bear much
Scandal from the frequent Impositions of our Fan∣cies
<PB N="15" REF="301"/>
and Imaginations upon our Judgments and
Understandings, as above.</P>
<P>But the more particular Discoveries of this Con∣verse
of Spirits, and which to me are undeniable;
are such as follows; namely,
<LIST>
<ITEM>Dreams,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Voices,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Noises,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Impulses,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Hints,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Apprehensions,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Involuntary Sad∣ness,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Dreams are dangerous Things to talk of; and
we have such dreaming about them, that indeed
the least Encouragement to lay any Weight upon
'em, is presently carry'd away by a sort of People
that dream waking; and that run into such wild
Extreams about them, that indeed we ought to
be very cautious what we say of them.</P>
<P>It is certain, Dreams of old were the Ways by
which God himself was pleased to warn Men, as
well what to do, as what not to do; what Ser∣vices
to perform, what Evils to shun. <HI>Joseph,</HI> the
Husband of the Blessed Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> was ap∣pear'd
to in both these, <HI>Matt.</HI> ii. 13. 19. He was
directed of God, in a Dream, to go into <HI>Egypt,</HI>
and he was bid return out of <HI>Egypt</HI> in a Dream;
and in the same Chapter, the Wise-men of the
East were <HI>warn'd of God in a Dream,</HI> to depart into
their own Country another Way, to avoid the
Fury of <HI>Herod.</HI></P>
<P>Now as this, and innumerable Instances thro' the
whole Scripture, confirm, that God did once make
use of this Manner to convey Knowledge and In∣struction
to Men, I wish I could have this Que∣stion
well answer'd, (<HI>viz.) Why are we now to▪ di∣rect
People to take no Notice of their Dreams?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="302"/>
But farther, it appears that this was not only
the Method God himself took by his immediate
Power, but 'tis evident he made use of it by the
Ministry of Spirits; the Scripture says in both the
Cases of <HI>Joseph</HI> above-nam'd, That <HI>the Angel of the
Lord appear'd to</HI> Joseph <HI>in a Dream.</HI> Now every
unembody'd Spirit is an Angel of the Lord in
some Sense, and, as Angels and Spirits may be the
same thing in respect of this Influence upon us in
Dreams, so it is still; and when any Notice for
Good, or Warning against Evil, is given us in a
Dream, I think 'tis no Arrogance at all for us to
say, the Angel of the Lord appear'd to us in a
Dream; or to say, some good Spirit gave me
Warning of this in a Dream; take this which
Way you will.</P>
<P>That I may support this with such undeniable
Arguments, drawn from Examples of the Fact, as
no Man will, or reasonably can oppose, I first ap∣peal
to the Experience of observing People; I
mean such People as observe these things without
a superstitious Dependence upon the Signification
of them, that look upon Dreams but with such
a moderate Regard to them, as may direct to a
right Use of them: The Question I would ask of
such is, Whether they have never found any re∣markable
Event of their Lives so evidently fore∣told
them by a Dream, as that it must of Neces∣sity
be true, that some invisible Being foresaw the
Event, and gave them Notice of it? And that
had that Notice been listen'd to, and the natural
Prudence used, which would have been used if it
had been certainly discovered, that evil Event
might have been prevented?</P>
<P>I would ask others, whether they have not, by
Dreams, been so warn'd of Evil really approach∣ing,
as that taking the Hint, and making use of
<PB N="17" REF="303"/>
the Caution given in those Dreams the Evil has
been avoided. If I may speak my own Expe∣rience,
I must take leave to say, That I never had
any capital Mischief befel me in my Life, but I
have had Notice of it by a Dream; and if I had
not been that thoughtless unbelieving Creature,
which I now would caution other People against,
I might have taken many a Warning, and avoided
many of the Evils that I afterwards fell into,
merely by a total obstinate Neglect of those
Dreams.</P>
<P>In like Manner, I have in some of the greatest
Distresses of my Life, been encouraged to believe
firmly and fully, that I should one Time or other
be delivered; and I must acknowledge, that in my
greatest and most hopeless Banishment, I had such
frequent Dreams of my Deliverance, that I al∣ways
entertained a firm and satisfying Belief, that
my last Days would be better than my first; all
which has effectually come to pass.</P>
<P>From which I cannot determine, <HI>as I know some
do,</HI> that all Dreams are meet Dosings of a deli∣tious
Head, Delusions of a waking Devil, and Re∣licts
of the Day's Thoughts, and Perplexities,
or Pleasures: Nor do I see any Period of Time
fixed between the two opposite Circumstances;
namely, when Dreams were to be esteemed the
Voice of God, and when the Delusion of the
Devil.</P>
<P>I know some have struggled hard to fix that
particular Article, and to settle it as a Thing go∣ing
hand in hand with the <HI>Jewish</HI> Institutions; as if
the Oracle ceasing in the Temple with the Con∣summation
of the typical Law, all the Methods
which Heaven was pleased to take in the former
Times for revealing his Will to Men, were to cease
also at the same Time, and the Gospel Revela∣tion
<PB N="18" REF="304"/>
being fully and effectually supplied by the
Mission of the Holy Spirit, Dreams and all the
Uses and Significations of Dreams were at an
End, and the Esteem and Regard to the Warn∣ings
and Instructions of Dreams was to expire
also.</P>
<P>But the Scripture is Point-blank against this,
in the History of Fact relating to <HI>Ananias,</HI> and
the Conversion of St. <HI>Paul;</HI> and in the Story of
St. <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Cornelius</HI> the devout Centurion at
<HI>Antioch;</HI> both of them eminent Instances of God's
giving Notice of his Pleasure to Men, by the In∣terposition
or Medium of a Dream. The first of
these is in <HI>Acts</HI> ix. 10. <HI>There was a certain Dis∣ciple
at</HI> Damascus <HI>named</HI> Ananias, <HI>To him said the
Lord in a Vision,</HI> &amp;c. the Words spoken in this Vi∣sion
to <HI>Ananias,</HI> directing to go to seek out one
<HI>Saul</HI> of <HI>Tarsus,</HI> go on thus <HI>v. 12. And hath seen in
a Vision, a Man named</HI> Ananias <HI>coming in.</HI></P>
<P>The other Passage is of St. <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Cornelius</HI>
the Centurion, <HI>Acts 10. v.</HI> 3, 10, 11. in the third
Verse it is said, <HI>Cornelius</HI> Fasting and Praying,
<HI>saw a Vision,</HI> which afterwards in the 22d Verse,
is called <HI>an holy Angel warning him,</HI> in the 30th
Verse it is said, <HI>a Man stood before me in bright
Cloathing;</HI> at the same Time, <HI>v.</HI> 10. it is said,
St. <HI>Peter</HI> was Praying and fell into <HI>a Trance;</HI> this
we will agree to be a Possession of Sleep or a deep
Sleep; and in this Traunce 'tis said, <HI>he saw Hea∣ven
opened,</HI> that is to say, he dreamed that he saw
Heaven opened; it could be nothing else; for
no Interpreters will offer to insist that Heaven
was really opened; also the hearing a Voice, <HI>v.</HI> 13,
15. must be in a Dream; thus 'tis apparent the
Will of God concerning what we are to do or not
to do, what is or is not to befal us, is and has
been thus conveyed by Vision or Dream, since the
<PB N="19" REF="305"/>
Expiration of the <HI>Levitical</HI> Dispensation, and since
the Mission of the Holy Ghost.</P>
<P>When then did it cease? and if we do not
know when it ceased, how then are we sure it is
at all ceased, and what Authority have we now
to reject all Dreams or Visions of the Night, <HI>as they
are called,</HI> more than formerly?</P>
<P>I will not say, but there may be more noctur∣nal
Delusions now in the World, than there were
in those Times; and perhaps the Devil may have
gain'd more upon Mankind in these Days, than
he had then, though we are not let into those
Things enough, to know whether it is so or not;
nor do we know, that there were not as many un∣signifying
Dreams in those Days as now, and per∣haps
as much to be said against depending upon
them; though I think there is not one Word in
Scripture said, to take off the Regard Men might
give to Dreams, or to lessen the Weight which
they might lay on them.</P>
<P>The only Text that I think looks like it, is the
Flout <HI>Joseph</HI>'s Brethren put upon him, or threw
out at him, when they were speaking of him with
Contempt, <HI>Genesis</HI> xxxvii. 19. <HI>Behold this Dreamer
cometh;</HI> and again, <HI>v. 20. Let us slay him and cast
him into some Pit,</HI> and we shall see <HI>what will be∣come
of his</HI> DREAMS.</P>
<P>This indeed looks a little like the present Lan∣guage
against Dreams; but even this, is sufficiently
rebuked in the Consequences, for those Dreams of
<HI>Joseph</HI>'s did come all to pass, and proving the su∣perior
Influence such Things have upon the Affairs
of Men, in spight of all the Contempt they can
cast upon them.</P>
<P>The Maxim I have laid down to my self for
my Conduct in this Affair is in few Words, that
<PB N="20" REF="306"/>
we should not lay too great Stress upon Dreams,
and yet not wholly neglect them.</P>
<P>I remember, I was once present, where a long
Dispute was warmly carried on between two
Persons of my Acquaintance upon this very Sub∣ject,
the one a Layman, the other a Clergyman,
but both very pious and religious Persons: The
first thought there was no heed at all to be
given to Dreams, that they could have no justi∣fiable
Original, that they were Delusions and no
more, that it was Atheistical to lay any Stress up∣on
them, and that he could give such Objections
against them, as that no Man of good Principles
could avoid being convinced by; that as to their
being a Communication from the invisible to the
visible World, 'twas a Chimaera, and that he saw
no Foundation for believing any Reality in such a
Thing, unless I would set up for a Popish <HI>Limbus</HI>
or Purgatory, which had no Foundation in the
Scripture.</P>
<P>1. He said, If Dreams were from the Agency
of any prescient Being, the Notices would be
more direct, and the Discoveries clear; not by
Allegories and emblematick Fancies, expressing
Things imperfect and dark: For to what Purpose
should Spirits un-embodied sport with Mankind,
warning him of approaching Mischiefs by the
most ridiculous Enigmas, Figures, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> leaving
the Wretch to guess what awaited him, though
of the utmost Consequence, and to perish if
he mistook the Meaning of it; and leaving
him sometimes perfectly at a Loss, to know
whether he was Right or Wrong, and without any
Rule of Guide to walk by in the most difficult
Cases.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="307"/>
2. He objected, that with the Notice of Evil,
suppose it to be rightly understood, there was not
given a Power to avoid it; and therefore it could
not be alledged, that the Notice was any way
kind, and that it was not likely to proceed from a
beneficent Spirit, but meerly Fortuitous and of
no Significancy.</P>
<P>3. He objected, That if such Notices as those
were of such Weight, why were they not Con∣stant:
But that sometimes they were given, and
sometimes omitted, though Cases were equally
important; and that therefore they did not seem
to proceed from any Agent, whose Actions were
to be fairly accounted for.</P>
<P>4. He said, That oftentimes we had very di∣stinct
and formal Dreams, without any Significa∣tion
at all, that we could neither know any Thing
probable or any Thing rational of them; and that
it would be profane to suggest that to come from
Heaven, which was too apparently foolish and
inconsistent.</P>
<P>5. As Men were not always thus warned, or
supplied with Notices of Good or Evil, so all
Men were not alike supplied with them; and
what Reason could we give, why one Man or one
Woman should not have the same Hints as ano∣ther.</P>
<P>The Clergyman gave distinct Answers to all
these Objections, and to me, I confess, very
satisfactory; whether they may be so to those that
read them, is no Concern of mine, let every one
judge for himself.</P>
<P>1. He said, that as to the Signification of
Dreams, and the Objections against them, be∣cause
dark and doubtful, that they are express'd
generally by Hieroglyphical Representations, Si∣milies,
Allusions, and figurative emblematick
<PB N="22" REF="308"/>
Ways of expressing Things was true, and that
by this Means, for want of Interpretation, the
Thing was not understood, and consequently the
Evil not shun'd. This, he said, was the only
Difficulty that remained to him in the Case, but
that he could see nothing in it against the Sig∣nification
of them, because thus it was be∣fore;
for Dreams were often allegorick and allu∣sive,
when they were evidently from God; and
what the End and Design of Providence in that
was, we could not pretend to enquire.</P>
<P>2. To the Second he said, <HI>we charged God foo∣lishly,</HI>
to say he had given the Notice of Evil
without <HI>the Power to avoid it,</HI> which he denied;
and affirmed, that if any one had not Power to
avoid the Evil, it was no Notice to him, that it
was want of giving due Heed to that Notice,
nor for want of the Notice being sufficient that,
any Evil followed, and that Men first neglected
themselves, and then charg'd the Judge of all the
Earth with not doing right.</P>
<P>3. Likewise he said, the Complaint that these no∣tices
were not constant, was unjust, for he doubt∣ed
not but they were so, but our discerning was
crazed and clouded by our Negligence in not tak∣ing
due Notice of it, that we hoodwink'd our
Understanding by pretending Dreams were not to
be regarded; and the Voice really spoke, but we
refused to hear being negligent of our own Good.</P>
<P>4. In the same Sense he answered the Fourth,
and said, it was a Mistake to say, that sometimes
Dreams had no Import at all, he said it was only
to be said, none that we could perceive the Rea∣son
of, which was owing to our Blindness and su∣pine
Negligence to be secure at one Time, and
our Heads too much alarmed at another; so that
the Spirit which we might be said to be conver∣sing
<PB N="23" REF="309"/>
with in a Dream, was constantly and equal∣ly
kind and careful, but our Powers, not always in
the same State of Action, nor equally attentive
to, or retentive of the Hints that were given; or
Things might be rendred more or less intelligible
to us, as the Powers of our Soul were more or less
doz'd or somniated with the Oppression of Va∣pours
from the Body, which occasions Sleep; for
tho' the Soul cannot be said to sleep itself, yet
how far its Operations may be limited, and the
Understanding perscribed by the Sleepiness of the
Body, <HI>says he,</HI> I will not undertake, let the Ana∣tomist
judge of it, who can account for the Con∣texture
of the Parts, and for their Operations,
which I cannot answer to.</P>
<P>5. As to the last Question, why People are not
equally supplied with such Warnings, he said, this
seem'd to be no Question at all in the Case; for
Providence itself might have some share in the
Direction of it, and then that Providence might
perhaps be limited by some superiour Direction,
the same that guides all the solemn Dispositions of
Nature, and was a Wind blowing where it list∣eth:
that as to the Converse of Spirits, tho' he
allowed the Thing itself, yet he did not tie it up
to a stated Course of Conversing, that it should
be the same always, and to all People, and on all
Occasions; but that it seem'd to be spontaneous,
and consequently Arbitrary, as if the Spirits
unembodied had it left to them to converse as
they thought fit, how, where, and with whom
they would; that all he answered for in that Dis∣course
was for the Thing itself, that such a Thing
there was, but why there was so much of it, or
why no more, was none of his Business, and he
believed a Discovery was not yet made to Man∣kind
of that Part.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="310"/>
I thought it would be much to the Purpose to
remark this Opinion of another Man, because it
corresponded so exactly with my own, but I have
not done with my Friend, for he led me into a∣nother
Enquiry, which indeed I had not taken
so much notice of before, and this was introdu∣ced
by the following Question.</P>
<P>You seem, says he, to be very inquisitive about
Dreams, and to doubt, <HI>tho' I think you have no
Reason for it,</HI> of the Reality of the World of Spi∣rits,
which Dreams are such an Evidence of Pray,
says he, what think you of waking Dreams, Tran∣ses,
Visions, Noises, Voices, Hints, Impulses,
and all these waking Testimonies of an invisible
World, and of the Communication that there is
between us and them, which are generally enter∣tained
with our Eyes open.</P>
<P>This led me into many Reflections upon past
Things, which I had been Witness to as well in
myself as in other People, and particularly in my
former Solitudes, when I had many Occasions to
mark such Things as these; and I could not but
entertain a free Conversation with my Friend up∣on
this Subject, as often as I had Opportunity,
of which I must give some Account.</P>
<P>I had one Day been conversing so long with
him upon the common received Notions of the
planets being habitable, and of a Diversity of
Worlds, that I think verily, I was for some Days
like a Man transported into these Regions myself;
whether my Imagination is more addicted to real∣lizing
the Things I talk of, as if they were in
View, I know not; or whether by the Power of
the Converse of Spirits I speak of, I was at that
Time enabled to entertain clearer Ideas of the
Invisible World, I really cannot tell; but I cer∣tainly
made a Journey to all those supposed ha∣bitable
<PB N="25" REF="311"/>
Bodies in my Imagination, and I know
not but it may be very useful to tell you what I
met with in my Way, and what the wiser I am
for the Discovery; whether you will be the wiser
for the Relation at second Hand, I cannot answer
for that.</P>
<P>I could make a long Discourse here of the Pow∣er
of Imagination, and how bright the Ideas of
Distant Things may be found in the Mind, when
the Soul is more than ordinarily agitated: It is
certain the extraordinary Intelligence conveyed in
this Manner is not always regular, sometimes it is
exceeding confused, and the Brain being not able
to digest it, turns round too fast; this tends to Lu∣nacy
and Distraction, and the Swiftness of the Mo∣tion
these Ideas come in with, occasions a Com∣motion
in Nature, the understanding is mobb'd
with them, disturb'd, runs from one Thing to ano∣ther,
and digests nothing; this is well expressed
in our common Way of talking of a mad Man,
namely, that his Head is turned. Indeed I can
liken it to nothing so well as to the Wheels of a
Wind-mill, which if the Sails or Wings are set,
and the Wind blow a Storm, run round so fast, that
they will set all on Fire, it a skilful Hand be not
ready to direct and manage it.</P>
<P>But not to enter upon this whymsical Description
of Lunacy, which perhaps may be no Bodies Opi∣nion
but my own, I proceed thus. That when the
Head is strong, and capable of the Impressions;
when the Understanding is impowered to digest
the infinite Variety of Ideas, which present to it
from the extended Fancy; then, I say, the Soul of
Man is capable of act strangely upon the Invisibles
in Nature, and upon Futurity, Reallizing every
Thing to itself in such a lively Manner, that what
it thus thinks of, it really sees, speaks to, hears,
<PB N="26" REF="312"/>
converses with, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as livelily, as if the Substance
was really before his Face; and this is what I
mean by those that dream waking, by Visions,
Trances, or what you please to call them; for it is
not necessary to this Part, that the Man should
be asleep.</P>
<P>I return to my Share of these Things. It was
after my conversing with my learned Friend a∣bout
the heavenly Bodies, the Motion, the Di∣stances,
and the Bulk of the Planets, their Si∣tuation,
and the Orbits they move in, the
Share of Light, Heat and Moisture, which they
enjoy, their Respect to the Sun, their Influences
upon us, and at last, the Possibility of their being
habitable, with all the Arcana of the Skies; it
was on this Occasion, I say, that my Imagination,
<HI>always given to wander,</HI> took a Flight of its own;
and as I have told you that I had an invincible
Inclination to travel, so I think I travelled as sen∣sibly,
to my understanding, over all the Mazes
and Wastes of infinite Space, in Quest of those
Things, as ever I did over the Desarts of <HI>Ka∣rakathay,</HI>
and the uninhabited Wasts of <HI>Tratary,</HI>
and perhaps may give as useful an Account of
my Journey.</P>
<P>When first my Fancy rais'd me up in the Con∣fines
of this vast Abyss, and having now tra∣velled
thro' the misty Regions of the Atmo∣sphere
could look down as I mounted, and see the
World below me, tis scarce possible to ima∣gine,
how little, how mean, how despicable every
Thing look'd; let any Man but try this Experi∣ment
of himself, and he shall certainly find the
same Thing; let him but fix his Thoughts so in∣tensly
upon what is, and must necessarily be seen
in a Stage or two higher, than where we now
live removed from the particular Converse with
<PB N="27" REF="313"/>
the World, as to reallize to his Imagination what
he can suppose to be there, he shall find all that
is below him, as distant Objects always do,
lessen in his Mind as they do in his Sight.</P>
<P>Could a Man subsist without a supply of Food,
and live but one Mile in perpendicular Height from
the Surface, he would despise Life and the World
at such a Rate, that he would hardly come down
to have it be all his own; the Soul of Man is
capable of being continually elevated above the
very Thoughts of human Things, is capable of
travelling up to the highest and most distant Re∣gions
of Light, but when it does, as it rises a∣bove
the earthly Globe, so the Things of this
Globe sink to him.</P>
<P>When I was at first lifted up in my imaginary
Travels, this was the first Thing of Moment I
remarked; namely, how little the World and every
Thing about it seemed to me: I am not given to
preach or drawing long Corollaries as the Learned
call them, but I commend it to my Friends to ob∣serve,
that could we always look upon the Things
of Life with the same Eyes, as we shall do when
we come to the Edge of Time, when one Eye can
as it were look back on the World, and the other
look forward into Eternity, we should save our∣selves
the Trouble of much Repentance, and
should scorn to touch many of those Things, in
which now we fancy our chief Felicity is laid up;
believe me we shall see more with half an Eye
then, and judge better at first Glance, than we
can now with all our pretended Wisdom and Pe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etration.
In a Word, all the Passions and Af∣fections
suffer a general Change upon such a View,
and what we desire before, we contemn then with
Abhorrence.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="314"/>
Having begun to soar, the World was soon out
of Sight, unless that as I rose higher, and could
look at her in a due Position as to the Sun, I could
see her turned into a Moon, and shine by Refle∣ction:
<HI>Ay, shine ou,</HI> said I, <HI>with thy borrowed Rays,
for thou hast but very few of thy own.</HI></P>
<P>When my Fancy had mounted me thus beyond
the Vestiges of the Earth, and leaving the Atmos∣phere
behind me, I had set my firm Foot upon the
Verge of Infinite, when I drew no Breath,
but subsisted upon pure <HI>Aether,</HI> it is not possible
to express fully the Vision of the Place; first you
are to conceive of Sight as unconfin'd, and you
see here at least the whole solar System at one View▪
Nor is your Sight bounded by the narrow Cir∣cumference
of one Sun, and its Attendants of Pla∣nets,
whose Orbits are appropriated to its proper
System, but above and beyond, and on every Side
you see innumerable Suns, and attending on them,
Planets, Satellites, and inferior Lights proper
to their respective Systems, and all these mov∣ing
in their subordinate Circumstances, without the
least Confusion, with glorious Light and Splendor
inconceivable.</P>
<P>In this first Discovery 'tis most natural to ob∣serve,
how plainly it is to be seen, that the Reason
of the Creation of such immense Bodies as the Sun,
Stars, Planets, and Moons in the great Circle of
the lower Heaven, is far from being to be found in
the Study of Nature, on the Surface of our Earth:
But he that will see thorowly, why God has formd
the Heavens the Work of his Hands, and the
Moon and the Stars which he has made, must soar
up higher; and then as he will see with other Eyes
than he did before, so he will see the God of Na∣ture
has form'd an infinite Variety which we know
<PB N="29" REF="315"/>
nothing of, and that all the Creatures are a Rea∣son
to one another for their Creation.</P>
<P>I could not forget myself however, when I was
got up thus high, I say, I could not but look back
upon the State of Man in this Life, how confined
from these Discoveries, how vilely employed in
biting and devouring, envying, and maligning one
another, and all for the vilest Trifles that can be
conceived.</P>
<P>But I was above it all here, and all those Things
which appeared so afflicting before, gave me not
the least Concern now; for the Soul being gone of
this Errand, had quite different Notices of the
whole State of Life, and was neither influenced
by Passions or Affections as it was before.</P>
<P>Here I saw into many Things by the Help of a
sedate Inquiry, that we can entertain little or no
Notion of in a State of common superficial
Life, and I desire to leave a few Remarks of this
imaginary Journey, as I did of my ordinary Tra∣vels.</P>
<P>When I came, I say, to look into the solar
System as I have hinted, I saw perfectly the Emp∣tiness
of our modern Notions, that the Planets
were habitable Worlds, and shall give a brief
Description of the Case, that others may see it
too, without the Necessity of taking so long a
Journey.</P>
<P>And first for the Word Habitable, I understand
the meaning of it to be, that the Place it is spo∣ken
of, is qualify'd for the Subsistence and Exi∣stence
of Man and Beast, and to preserve the vege∣tative
and sensitive Life; and you may depend up∣on
it, that none of the Planets except the Moon,
are in this Sense habitable; and the Moon, a poor
little watery damp Thing, not above as big as
<HI>Yorkshire,</HI> neither worth being called a World, nor
<PB N="30" REF="316"/>
capable of rendring Life comfortable to Mankind,
if indeed supportable; and if you will believe
one's Mind capable of seeing at so great a Di∣stance,
I assure you I did not see Man, Woman or
Child there in all my Contemplative Voyage to
it; my Meaning is, I did not see the least Rea∣son
to believe there was or could be any there. As
to the rest of the Planets, I'll take them in their
Order. <HI>Saturn,</HI> (the remotest from the Sun, which
is in the Centre of the System,) is a vast extended
Globe, of a Substance cold and moist, its greatest
Degree of Light is never so much as our greatest
Darkness may be said to be in clear Weather, and
its cold unsufferable; and if it were a Body com∣posed
of the same Elements as our Earth, its Sea
would be all Brass, and its Earth all Iron; that
is to say, both would be continually frozen, as
the North-Pole in the Winter Solstice. What Man
or Men, and of what Nature, could inhabit this
frigid Planet, unless the Creator must be sup∣posed
to have created animal Creatures for the
Climate, not the Climate for the Creatures. All
the Notions of <HI>Saturns</HI> being a habitable World,
are contrary to Nature, and incongruous with Sense;
for <HI>Saturn</HI> is at so infinite a Distance from the
Sun, that it has not above one ninetieth Part of
the Light and Heat that we enjoy on our Earth;
so that the Light there, may be said to be much
less than our Star-light, and the cold ninety Times
greater than the coldest Day in our Winter.</P>
<P><HI>Jupiter</HI> is in the same Predicament, his Consti∣tution,
however in its Degree much milder than
<HI>Saturn,</HI> yet certainly is not qualify'd for human
Bodies to subsist, having only one twenty-seventh
Part of the Light and Heat that we enjoy here,
consequently its Light is at best as dim as our
Twilight, and its Heat so little in the Summer of
<PB N="31" REF="317"/>
its Situation, as to be as far from comfortable, as
it is in its Winter Situation insupportable.</P>
<P><HI>Mars,</HI> If you will believe our ancient Philoso∣phers,
is a fiery Planet in the very Disposition of
its Influence, as well as by the Course of its Mo∣tion;
and yet even here, the Light is not above
one Half, and its Heat one Third of ours. And
on the other Hand, as <HI>Saturn</HI> is cold and moist,
so this Planet is hot and dry, and would admite
no Habitation of Man, through the manifest In∣temperance
of the Air, as well as want of Light
to make it comfortable, and Moisture to make it
fruitful; for by the Nature of the Planet, as well
as by clear-sighted Observation, there is never
any Rain, Vapour, Fog, or Dew in that Pla∣net.</P>
<P><HI>Venus</HI> and <HI>Mercury</HI> are in the extreme the other
Way, and would destroy Nature by their Heat
and dazling Light, as the other would by their
Darkness and Cold, so that you may depend up∣on
it, I could see very clearly, that all these Bo∣dies
were neither inhabited or habitable; and the
Earth only as we call it, being seated between these
Intemperances appeared habitable, surrounded
with an Atmosphere to defend it, from the Inva∣sion
of the inconsistent <HI>Aether,</HI> in which Perspiration
could not be performed by the Lungs, and by
which the needful Vapour it sends forth, is pre∣serv'd
from dissipating into the Waste and Abyss,
and is condensed and timely returns in Showers of
Rain to moisten, cool, and nourish the exhausted
Earth.</P>
<P>It is true the Way I went was no common
Road, yet I found Abundance of Passengers go∣ing
to and fro here, and particularly innumerable
Armies of good and evil Spirits, who all seem'd
busily employed, and continually upon the Wing, as
<PB N="32" REF="318"/>
if some Expresses pass'd between the Earth, which
in this Part of my Travels I place below me, and
some Country infinitely beyond all that I could
reach the Sight of; for by the Way, though I
take, upon me in this sublime Journey to see a
great deal of the invisible World, yet I was not
arrived to a Length to see into any Part of the
World of Light, beyond it all; that Vision is
beyond all, and I pretend to say nothing of it
here, except this only, that a clear View of this
Part with Opticks unclouded is a great Step to
prepare the Mind for a Look into the other.</P>
<P>But to return to my Station in the highest crea∣ted
World, flatter not yourselves that those Re∣gions
are uninhabited, because the Planets ap∣pear
to be so. No, no, I assure you this is that
World of Spirits, or at least is a World of Spirits.</P>
<P>Here I saw a clear Demonstration of Satan be∣ing
<HI>the Prince of the Power of the Air;</HI> 'tis in this
boundless Waste he is confined, whether it be his
busie restless Inclination has posted him here, that
he may affront God in his Government of the
World, and do Injury to Mankind in meer Envy
to his Happiness, as the fam'd Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> says it,
or whether it is that by the eternal Decree of Pro∣vidence
he is appointed to be Mans continual
Disturber for divine Ends, to us unknown; this
I had not wandred far enough to be informed of,
those Secrets being lodged much higher, than I∣magination
itself ever travelled.</P>
<P>But here, I say, I found Sathan keeping his
Court, or Camp we may call it, which we please.
The innumerable Legions that attended his im∣mediate
Service were such, that it is not at all to
be wondred that he supplied every Angle of this
World, and had his Work going forward, not in
every Country only, but even in every individual
<PB N="33" REF="319"/>
Inhabitant of it, with all the Dexterity and Appli∣cation
imaginable.</P>
<P>This Sight gave me a just Idea of the Devil
as a Tempter, but really let me into a Secret,
which I did not so well know before, or at least
did not consider; namely, that the Devil is not
capable of doing half the Mischief in the World
that we lay to his Charge; that he works by En∣gines
and Agents, Stratagems and Art is true, and
a great deal is owing to his Vigilance and Ap∣plication;
for he is a very diligent Fellow in his
Calling: But 'tis plain, his Power is not so great
as we imagine, he can only prompt to the Crime,
he cannot force us to commit it; so that if we sin
'tis all our own, the Devil is only to be charged
with the Art of Insinuation; just as he began with
<HI>Eve,</HI> he goes on with us; in short he reasons us
out of our Resolutions to do well, and wheedles us
to an Agreement to do ill; working us up to an
Opinion, that what Evil we are about to do is no
Sin, or not so great a Sin as we feared, and so
draws us by Art into the Crime we had resolved
against; this indeed the Scripture intimates when
it speaks of <HI>Satan's Devices,</HI> the <HI>Subtilty of the
wicked one, his lying in wait,</HI> &amp;c. But to charge
the Devil with forcing us to offend, is doing the
Devil a great Deal of Wrong: Our doing Evil is
from the native Propensity of our Wills: <HI>Huma∣mun
est peccare.</HI> I will not enter here into the Dis∣pute
about an original Corruption in Nature, which
I know many good Men and learned Men dispute,
but that there is a secret Aptness to offend, and a
secret Backwardness to what is Good, which if
it is not born with us, we can give no Account how
we came by, this I think every Man will grant;
and that this is the Devil that tempts us, the Scrip∣ture
plainly tells us, when it says, <HI>Every Man is
<PB N="34" REF="320"/>
tempted when he is drawn away of his own Lust and
enticed.</HI></P>
<P>There is a secret Love of Folly and Vanity in
the Mind, and Mankind are hurry'd down the
Stream of their own Affections into Crime, 'tis
agreeable to them to do this, and 'tis a Force up∣on
Nature not to do it.</P>
<Q><L>Vice is down Hill, and when we do offend,</L>
<L>'Tis Nature all, we act as we intend.</L></Q>
<Q><L>Vertue's up Hill, and all against the Grain</L>
<L>Resolv'd reluctant, and pursued with Pain.</L></Q>
<P>But to return to the Devil; his Power not
extending to Creation, and being not able to force
the World into an open Rebellion against Heaven,
as doubtless he would do if he could, he is left to
the Exercise of his Skill; and in a Word we may
say of him, <HI>that he lives by his Wits;</HI> that is to say,
maintains his Kingdom by Subtilty and most ex∣quifire
Cunning; and if my Vision of his Poli∣ticks
is not a new Discovery, I am very much
mistaken.</P>
<P>His innumerable Legions as I hinted above, like
<HI>Aid du Camps</HI> to a General, are continually em∣ployed
to carry his Orders, and execute his Com∣missions
in all Parts of the World, and in every in∣dividual
to oppose the Authority of God, and the
Felicity of Man to the utmost of his Power.</P>
<P>The first and greatest Part of his Government,
is over those Savage Nations where he has obtain∣ed
to set himself up as God, and to be worshipped
instead of God; and I observed, that though ha∣ving
full Possession of these People, even by whole
Nations as a Time, that is the easiest Part of his
<PB N="35" REF="321"/>
Government, yet he is far from neglecting his Inte∣rest
there, but is exceeding vigilant to keep up his
Authority among those People. This he does
by sending Messengers into those Parts to answer
the <HI>Pawawings</HI> or Conjurings, even of the most
ignorant old Wizard, raising Storms and making
Noises and Shreiks in the Air, Flashes of infernal
Fire, and any Thing but to fright the People,
that they may not forget him, and that they may
have <HI>no other Gods but him.</HI></P>
<P>He has his peculiar Agents for this Work,
which he makes Detachments of, as his Occasions,
require, some to one Part of the World, some to
another, as to the North <HI>America,</HI> even as far as
to the frozen Provinces of <HI>Groenland;</HI> to the North
of <HI>Europe,</HI> to the <HI>Laplanders, Samoiedes,</HI> and <HI>Mon∣gul-Tartars,</HI>
also to the <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog</HI> of <HI>Asia,</HI>
and to the Devil-makers of <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japan,</HI>
again to the Southern Parts of <HI>Asia,</HI> to the Isles
of the <HI>Indian</HI> and <HI>South Seas,</HI> and to the South
Part of <HI>America</HI> and <HI>Africa.</HI></P>
<P>Through all these Parts he has an uncontroull'd
Power, and is either worshipped in Person, or by
his Representatives, the Idols and Monsters which
the poor People bow down to, and <HI>Satan</HI> has very
little Trouble with them.</P>
<P>He employs indeed some Millions of his Missio∣naries
into those Countries, who labour <HI>ad propa∣gand.
fid.</HI> and fail not to return and bring him an
Account of their Success, and I doubt not but
some of them were at Hand in my Island, when
the Savages appear'd there; for it the Devil had
not been in them, they would hardly have come
straggling over the Sea so far, to devour one
another.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="322"/>
In all these Countries the Brutality, the Cruelty
and ravenous bloody Dispositions of the People, is
to me a certain Testimony that the Devil has full
Possession of them.</P>
<P>But to return to my Observations in the exalted
State of my Fancy, I must tell you, that though
the Devil carried on his Schemes of Government,
in those blinded Parts of the World with great
Ease, and all Things went to his Mind; I found
he had more Difficulty in the northern Parts of
the temperate Zone, I mean, our Climate and
the rest of Christendom, and consequently he did
not act here by whole Squadrons and by Generals;
but was obliged to carry on his Business among us
by particular Solicitations, to act by particular
Agents upon particular Persons, attacking the
personal Conduct of Men in a Manner peculiar to
himself: But so far was this Difficulty from being
any Advantage to the World, or Disadvantage to
the Devil, that it only obliged him to make Use
of the more Engines; and as he had no want of
Numbers, I observed that his whole Clan seemed
busy on this Side, the Number of which consists
of innumerable M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llions; so that in short, there
was not a Devil wanting, no, not to manage eve∣ry
individual Man, Woman, and Child in the
World.</P>
<P>How and in what Manner evil Angels attend us,
what their Business, how far their Power extends,
and how far it is restrained, and by who, were all
made plain to me at one View in this State of
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> that I stood in now, and I will de∣scribe
it if I can in a few Heads of Fact; you may
enlarge upon them us Experience guides.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="323"/>
And first, the Limitations of the Devil's Power,
are necessary to be understood, and how di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ected;
<HI>for Example,</HI> you must know, that though the
Numbers of these Evil Spirits, which are thus
diligently employed in Mischief, are so infinitely
great, yet the Numbers of good Angels or good
Spirits, which are employed by a superior Au∣thority,
and from a Place infinitely distant and
high above the Devils bounds, is not only equal;
I say, equal at least in Number, but infinitely su∣perior
in Power, and it is this Particular which
makes it plain, that all the Devil does, or that his
Agents can do, is by continual Subtilty, extreme
Vigilance and Application, under infinite Checks,
Rebukes, and Callings off by the attendant Spi∣rits,
who have Power to correct and restrain him.
upon all Occasions; just as a Man does a Dog or
a Thief when he is discovered.</P>
<P>On this Account, 'tis first plain, I say, that the
Devil can do nothing by Force, he cannot kill,
maim, hurt or destroy; if he could, Mankind
would have but a very precarious State of Life in
the World: Nay, the Devil cannot blast the Fruits
of the Earth, cause Dearth, Droughts, Famine,
or Scarcity, neither can he spread noxious Fumes
in the Air to infect the World; if any of those
Things were in his Power, he would soon unpeo∣ple
God's Creation, and put his Maker to the
Necessity of a new FIAT, or of having no more
human Creatures to worship and honour him.</P>
<P>You will ask me, how I came to know all this?
say, ask me no Questions, till the Elevation
of your Fancy carries you up to the outer Edge of
the Atmosphere, as I tell you mine did: There
you will see the Prince of the Air in his full State,
managing his universal Empire with the most exqui∣site
Art: But if ever you can come to a clear View
<PB N="38" REF="324"/>
of his Person, do but look narrowly, and you'll
see a great Clog at his Foot, in token of his li∣mited
Power, and though he is himself immense in
Bulk, and moves like a Fiery Meteor in the Air,
yet you always see a Hand with a Thunderbolt
impending just over his Head; the Arm coming
out of a fiery Cloud, which is a Token of the Sen∣tence
he is under, that at the End of his appointed
Time that Cloud shall break, and that Hand strike
him with the Thunder represented, Down, Down
for ever, into a Place prepared for him.</P>
<P>But all this does not hinder him, who is
prompted by infernal Rage against the Kingdom
of God, and the Welfare of Man, from pushing
Mankind as above, upon all the Methods of their
own Ruin and Destruction, by alluring Baits, cun∣ning
Artifice, Night-whispers, infusing wicked De∣sires,
and fanning the Flames of Men's Lusts,
Pride, Avarice, Ambition, Revenge, and all the
wicked Excursions of corrupt Nature.</P>
<P>It would take up a long Tract by itself, to form
a System of the Devil's Politicks, and to lay down
a Body of his Philosophy: I observ'd how∣ever,
that some of his general Rules are such as
these.</P>
<P>1. To infuse Notions of Liberty into the
Minds of Men; that it is hard they should be
born into the World with Inclinations, and then be
forbidden to gratify them; that such and such
Pleasures should be prepar'd in the Nature of
Things, made suitable and proper to the Senses
and Faculties, which on the other Hand, are pre∣pared
in mere Constitution, and placed in his
Soul, and that then he should be forbidden under
the Penalty of a Curse to taste them; that to place
an Appetite in the Man, and a strong powerful
Gust to these Delights, and then declare them fa∣tal
<PB N="39" REF="325"/>
to him, would be laying a Snare to Man∣kind
in his very Constitution, and making his
brightest Faculties be the Betrayers of his Soul to
Misery, which would not consist with Justice,
much less with the Goodness of a Creator.</P>
<P>2. To persuade from hence, that the Notions
of future Punishments are Fables and Amuse∣ments,
that it is not rational to think a just God
would prepare infinite and eternal Punishments,
for finite and trivial Offences; that God does not
take Notice of the minute acts of Life, and lay
every Slip to our Charge, but that the merciful
Dispositions of God, who so bountifully directs
the whole World to be assistant to the Profit and
Delight of Mankind, has certainly given him
leave to enjoy it at fill, and take the Comfort of
it without fear.</P>
<P>3. Of late indeed the Devil has learn'd, <HI>for De∣vils
may improve as well as Men in the Arts of doing
ill.</HI> At last, I say, he has learned to infuse a wild
Notion into the Heads of some People, who are
first fitted for it, by having reasoned themselves in
Favour of their loose Desires up to a Pitch, that
there is no such Thing as a God or a future State
at all.</P>
<P>Now as at first the Devil was not Fool enough
to attempt to put this Jest upon Man, his own
Antiquity and Eternity being a Contradiction to it;
so I found among my new Discoveries, that the Devil
took this Absurdity from Man himself, and that it
went among Satan's People for a new Invention: I
found also that there was a black I arty employ'd
upon this new Subtilty, these were a Sort of De∣vils,
for Satan never wants Instruments, who were
call'd <HI>Insiauators,</HI> and who were formerly employed
to prompt Men to Crimes by Dreams; and here I
shall observe, that I learned a Way how to make
<PB N="40" REF="326"/>
any Man dream of what I please: <HI>For Example,</HI>
suppose one to be sound asleep, or as we say, in a
deep Sleep, or dead asleep, let another lay his
Mouth close to his Ear, and whisper any Thing
to him so softly as not to awaken him, the sleep∣ing
Man shall certainly dream of what was so
Whispered to him.</P>
<P>Let to Man despise this Hint, nothing is more
sure, than that many of our Dreams are the Wis∣pers
of the Devil, who by his <HI>Insinuators</HI> whispers
into our Heads, what wicked Things he wou'd
have our Thoughts entertain and work upon; and
take this with you as you go, those insinuating
Devils can do this as well when we are awake, as
when we are asleep, and this will bring me to
what I call <HI>Impulses upon the Mind,</HI> which are cer∣tainly
whispers in the Ear and no other, and come
either from good Angels attending us, or from the
Devil's <HI>Insinuators,</HI> which are always at hand, and
may be Judged of according as the Subject our
Thoughts are prompted to work upon, are Good
or Evil.</P>
<P>From whence but from these Insinuators, come
our causeless Passions, our involuntary Wickedness,
sinning in Desire as effectually, as by actual com∣mitting
the Crime we desire to commit?</P>
<P>Whence comes Imagination to work upon
wicked and vicious Objects, when the Person is
fast asleep, and when he had not been under the
Preparation of wicked Discourse, or wicked
Thoughts previous to those Imaginations? who
forms Ideas in the Mind of Man? who presents
beautiful or terrible Figures to his Fancy, when
his Eyes are clos'd with Sleep? who, but these in∣sinuating
Devils, who invisibly approach the
Man sleeping or waking, and whisper all man∣ner
of lewd abominable Things into his Mind.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="327"/>
Mr. <HI>Milton,</HI> whose Imagination was carried up
to a greater Height than I am now, went farther
into the Abyss of Satan's Empire a great Way,
especially when he form'd Satan's Palace of <HI>Pande∣monium,
I say,</HI> he was exactly of this Opinion, when
he represented the Devil tempting our Mother <HI>Eve,</HI>
in the Shape of a Toad lying just at her Ear. when
she lay fast asleep in her Bower, where he whisper'd
to her Ear all the wicked Things which she en∣tertained
Notions of by Night, and which
prompted her the next Day to break the great Com∣mand,
which was the rule of her Life; and ac∣cordingly
he brings in <HI>Eve telling Adam</HI> what an
uneasy Night's Rest she had, and relating her
Dream to him.</P>
<P>This Thought, however laid down in a kind of
Jest, is very seriously intended, and would, if well
digested, direct us very clearly in our Judgment of
Dreams; <HI>viz.</HI> not to suggest them to be always
Things of meer Chance; but that sometimes they
are to be heeded as useful Warnings of Evil or
Good by the Agency of good Spirits, as at other
Times they are the artful Insinuations of the De∣vil
to inject wicked Thoughts and abhorr'd abo∣minable
Ideas into the Mind; which we ought not
only as much as possible to guard against, but even
to repent of, so far as the Mind may have enter∣tained
and acted upon them.</P>
<P>From this general Vision of the Devil's Ma∣nagement
of his Affairs, which I must own I have
had with my Eyes wide open, I find a great many
useful Observations to be made; and first, it can
be no longer strange, that while the Commerce of
Evil Spirits is so free, and the intercourse between
this World and that, is thus open, I say, it can be
no longer strange, that there are so many silent
<PB N="42" REF="328"/>
Ways of Spirits conversing, I mean Spirits of
all Kinds.</P>
<P>For as I have observed already, there is a Resi∣dence
of good Spirits, but they are placed infinite∣ly
higher out of the Reach, and out of the Sight of
this lower Orbit of Satan's Kingdom; as
those pass and repass invisible, I confess, I have
yet had no Ideas of them, but those which I have
received from my first View of the infernal Re∣gion:
If I should have any superior Elevations,
and should be able to see the O Economy of Heaven
in his Disposition of Things on Earth, I shall be
as careful to convey them to Posterity as they
come in.</P>
<P>However, the Transactions of good Spirits with
Man are certainly the same; for as God has for
a Protection and Safeguard to Mankind, limited
the Devil from affrighting him, by visible Appear∣ances
in his native and hellish Deformity, and the
horrrid Shape he would necessarily bear: So for
Man's Felicity, even the glorious Angels of Hea∣ven
are very seldom allowed, at least not lately,
to appear in the glorious Forms they formerly
took, or indeed in any Form, or with a Voice;
the restraint of our Souls in the Case of Flesh and
Blood we now wear not admitting it, and not
being able to familiarize those Things to us; Man
being by no Means, in his encorporated State, qua∣lified
for an open and easy Conversation with un∣embodied
Spirit.</P>
<P>Moreover, this would be breaking into the
Limits, which the Wisdom and Goodness of God
has put to our present State, I mean as to Futurity,
our Ignorance in which, is the greatest Felicity of
human Life; and without which necessary Blind∣ness
Man could not support Life, for Nature is no
way able to support a View into Futurity; I mean
<PB N="43" REF="329"/>
not into that Part of Futurity which concerns us in
our State of Life in this World.</P>
<P>I have often been myself among the Number of
those Fools, that would be their own Fortune-tel∣lers;
but when I look thus beyond the Atmosphere,
and see a little speculatively into Invisibles, I could
easily perceive, that it is our Happiness that we
are short-sighted Creatures, and can see but a very
little before us: <HI>For Example,</HI> were we to have the
Eyes of <HI>our Souls</HI> opened through the Eyes of <HI>our
Bodies,</HI> we should see this very immediate Region
of Air which we breath in, throng'd with Spirits,
to us, <HI>blessed be God,</HI> now invisible, and which would
otherwise be most frightful: We should see into
the secret Transactions of those Messengers who
are employ'd when the passing Soul takes its Leave
of the Reluctant Body, and perhaps see Things Na∣ture
would shrink back from with the utmost Ter∣ror
and Amazement. In a Word, the Curtain of Pro∣vidence
for the Dispofition of Things here, and
the Curtain of Judgment for the Determination of
the State of Souls hereafter, would be alike
drawn back, and what Heart could support here
its future State <HI>in LIFE,</HI> much less that of its
future State <HI>after LIFE</HI> even good or bad.</P>
<P>It is then our Felicity, that the Converse of Spi∣rits,
and the Visions of Futurity, are silent, em∣blematick,
and done by Hints, Dreams, and Im∣pulses,
and not by clear Vision and open Discovery;
they that desire a fuller and plainer Sight of these
Things, ask they know not what; and it was a
good Answer of a Gypsy, when a Lady of my Ac∣quaintance,
ask'd her, to tell her Fortune; <HI>Do not
ask me, Lady,</HI> said the Gypsy, <HI>to tell you what you
dare not hear.</HI> The Woman was a little honester than
her Profession intimated, and freely confess'd it was
all a Cheat, and that they knew nothing of Fortunes,
<PB N="44" REF="330"/>
but had a Course or Round of doubtful Expressions,
to amuse ignorant People and get a little Money.</P>
<P>Even the Devils Oracles, for such no doubt
they were at <HI>Delphos,</HI> and at other Places, though
the Devil seemed at that Time to have some Li∣berties
granted him, which it is evident have since
been denied him, were allowed to be given only
in doubtful Expressions, double Entendres, Ecchoes
of Words, and such like: <HI>For Example,</HI> A Man
going to Sea and enquiring of the Oracle, thus;
<Q><L>Have I just cause the Seas and Storms to Fear?</L>
<L>Eccho.—<HI>Fear.</HI></L></Q>
Another.
<Q><L>Shall we the <HI>Parthian</HI> Bowmen fight or Fly?</L>
<L>Eccho.—<HI>Fly.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Such dark Replies, and other Words doubtful
and enigmatic, were frequently given and taken for
Answers, by which the deluded World were kept in
doubt of that Futurity they hunted after: But Satan
even then, was not permitted to speak plain, or
Mankind to see what awaited him behind the dark
Veil of Futurity, nor was it proper on any Ac∣count
whatsoever, that it should be otherwise.</P>
<P>But before I come to this, let me far from Li∣mits
to the Elevations and Visions I have men∣tioned
before; for as I am far from Enthusiastic
in my Notions of Things, so I would not lead any
one to fancy themselves farther enlightned than is
meet, or to see Things unseeable, as St. <HI>Paul</HI> heard
Things unutterable.</P>
<P>And therefore let me add here, that the highest
Raptures, Trances and Elevations of the Soul, are
bounded by the eternal Decree of Heaven and let
<PB N="45" REF="331"/>
Men pretend to what Visions they please, it is all
Romance, all beyond what I have talked of a∣bove,
is fabulous and absurd, and it will for ever
be true, as the Scripture says, not only, <HI>those
Things are hid from the Eye,</HI> but even from the
Conception.</P>
<P>Upon this Occasion I must own, that I think
'tis Criminal to attempt to form Ideas either of
Hell or of Heaven in the Mind, other than as the
Scripture has described them, by the State rather
than the Place; we are told in plain Words, <HI>it
hath not entred into the Heart of Man to conceive,</HI> ei∣ther
of what is prepared for the future State of the
Happy or Miserable; 'tis enough for us to enter∣tain
the general Notion, the Favour of God is
Heaven, and the Loss of it the most dreadful of
all Hell.</P>
<Q><L>A <HI>HEAVEN</HI> of Joy must in his Presence dwell;</L>
<L>And in his Absence every Place is <HI>HELL.</HI></L></Q>
<P>My Meaning is this, all Visions, or propoun∣ded
Visions either of Heaven or Hell, are meet<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Delusions of the Mind, and generally are Fictions
of a waking bewildred Head; and you may see
the Folly of them in the meannest of the Descrip∣tions,
which generally end in shewing some glo∣rious
Place, fine Walks, noble illustrious Palaces,
Gardens of Gold, and People of shining Forms,
and the like. Alas! these are all so short, that
they are Unworthy the Thoughts of a Mind
elevated two Degrees above Darkness and Dirt:
All these Things amount to no more than <HI>Ma∣bomet</HI>'s
Alchoran, and the glorious State of Things
represented by him to his Believers. In short,
all this makes only a Heaven of Sense, but comes
so infinitely short of what alone must or can be
<PB N="46" REF="332"/>
a Heaven to an exalted glorified Spirit, that I
as much want Words to express how contem∣tible
the best of these Descriptions are as to a
true Description of Heaven, as I do to express a
true Idea, or Description of Heaven myself.</P>
<P>And how should this be done? We can Form
no Idea of any Thing that we know not and have
not seen, but in the Form of something that we
have seen. How then can we form an Idea of
God or Heaven, in any Form but of some∣thing
which we have seen or known? By what
Image in the Mind can we judge of Spirits? By
what Idea conceive of eternal Glory? Let us
cease to Imagin concerning it, 'tis impossible to
attain, 'tis criminal to attempt it.</P>
<P>Let me therefore hint here, that supposing my
self, as before, in the Orbit of the Sun, take it
in its immense Distance as our Astronomers con∣ceive
of it, or on the Edge only of the Atmos∣phere
with a clear View of the whole <HI>Solar Sy∣stem,</HI>
the Region of Satan's Empire all in View,
and the World of Spirits laid open to me.</P>
<P>Yet let me give you this for a Check to your
Imagination, that even here the Space between
Finite and Infinite is as impenetrable as on Earth,
and will for ever be so, till our Spirits being un∣cased
shall take their Flight to the Center of
Glory, where every Thing shall be seen as it is;
and therefore you must not be surprized, if I am
come down again from the Verge of the World
of Spirits, the same short sighted Wretch, as to Fu∣turity
and Things belonging to Heaven and Hell
as I went up; for Elevations of this Kind are
meant only to give us a clearer View of what we
<HI>are,</HI> not of what we <HI>shall be;</HI> and 'tis an Advan∣tage
worth Travelling for too. All this I thought
necessary to prevent the whimsical Building of
<PB N="47" REF="333"/>
erroneous Structures on my Foundation, and fan∣cying
themselves carried farther than they are
able to go.</P>
<P>I come therefore back to talk of Things fa∣miliar,
and particularly to mention in the next
Place, some of those other Ways by which we
have Notice given of this Converse of Spirits
which I have been speaking of; for the Whis∣pers
and Insinuators I have mentioned, go some∣times
farther than ordinary.</P>
<P>One of those other Methods is, when by
<HI>strong Impulses</HI> of the Mind, as we call them, we
are directed to do, or not to do, this or that
particular Thing that we have before us to do, or,
are under Consultation about. I am a Witness
to many of these Things, as well in my own Life,
as in my Observation of others.</P>
<P>I know a Man, who being at some Distance
from <HI>London,</HI> not above six or seven Miles, a
Friend that came to visit and dine with him urged
him to go to <HI>London.</HI> What for, says, his Friend,
is there any Business wants me? Nay, nothing,
says the other, but for your Company; I do not
know of any Thing wants you; and so gave over
importuning him: But as his Friend had given
it over, a strong Impulse of Mind seized him and
follow'd him like a Voice with this, <HI>Go to</HI> London,
<HI>go to</HI> London. He put it by several Times, but it
went on still, Go to <HI>London,</HI> go to <HI>London,</HI> and
nothing else could come upon his Thoughts but,
<HI>Go to</HI> London. He came back to his Friend,
Hark ye, says he, tell me sincerely, is all well
at <HI>London?</HI> Am I wanted there? Did you ask me
to go to <HI>London</HI> with you on any particular Ac∣count.
Not I, says his Friend, in the least; I
saw all your Family, and all is very well there;
not did they say, they had any particular Occa∣sion
<PB N="48" REF="334"/>
for you to return; I only ask it as I told
you, for the Sake of your Company: So he put
off going again, but could have no Quiet, for it
still followed him, and no doubt, a good Spirit
communicated it, Go to <HI>London;</HI> and at length
he resolved he would go, and did so; and when
he came there he found a Letter and Messengers
had been at his House, to seek him, and to tell
him of a particular Business, which was first and
last worth above a thousand Pounds to him, and
which if he had not been found that very Night,
would have been in Danger of being lost.</P>
<P>I seriously advise all sober thinking Persons not
to disregard those powerful Impulses of the Mind,
in Things otherwise indifferent or doubtful, but
believe them to be Whispers from some kind Spi∣rit,
which sees something that we cannot see,
and knows something that we cannot know.</P>
<P>Besides, unless infinite Power should take off
the Silence that is imposed upon the Inhabitants
of the invisible World, and allow them to speak
audibly, nothing can be a plainer Voice; they
are Words spoken to the Mind, tho' not to the
Ear, and they are a certain Intelligence of Things
unseen, because they are given by Persons un∣seen,
and the Event confirms it beyond all Di∣spute,</P>
<P>I know a Man, who made it his Rule always
to obey these silent Hints, and he has often de∣clared
to me, that when he obeyed them he ne∣ver
miscarried, and if he neglected them, or went
on contrary to them, he never succeeded; and
gave me a particular Case of his own, among
a great many others, wherein he was thus direct∣ed.
He had a particular Case befallen him,
wherein he was under the Displeasure of the Go∣vernment,
and was prosecuted for a Misdemea∣nor,
<PB N="49" REF="335"/>
and brought to a Tryal in the King's Bench
Court, where a Verdict was brought against him,
and he was cast; and Times running very hard
at that Time against the Party he was of, he
was afraid to stand the Hazard of a Sentence
and absconded, taking Care to make due Provi∣sion
for his Bail, and to pay them whatever they
might suffer. In this Circumstance he was in
great Distress, and no Way presented unto him
but to fly out of the Kingdom, which being to
leave his Family, Children and Employment, was
very bitter to him, and he knew not what to
do; all his Friends advising him not to put him∣self
into the Hands of the Law, which tho' the
Offence was not Capital, yet in his Circum∣stances
seemed to threaten his utter Ruin. In
this Extremity he felt one Morning, (just as he
had awaked, and the Thoughts of his Misfor∣tune
began to return upon him;) I say, he felt a
strong Impulse darting into his Mind thus, <HI>Write
a Letter to them:</HI> It spoke so distinctly to him,
and as it were forcibly, that as he has often said
since, he can scarce persuade himself not to be∣lieve
but that he heard it; but he grants that he
did not really hear it, too.</P>
<P>However it repeated the Words daily and
hourly to him, till at length walking about in
his Chamber where he was hidden, very pen∣sive
and sad, it Jogg'd him again, and he an∣swered
aloud to it, as if it had been a Voice,
<HI>Who shall I write to?</HI> It returned immediately,
<HI>Write to the Judge.</HI> This persued him again for
several Days, till at length he took his Pen, Ink
and Paper, and sat down to write, but knew not
one Word of what he should say, but <HI>Dabitur in hac
hora, he wanted not Words:</HI> It was immediately im∣pressed
on his Mind, and the Words flowed up∣on
<PB N="50" REF="336"/>
his Pen in a manner, that even charm'd him∣self,
and filled him with Expectations of Success.</P>
<P>The Letter was so strenous in Argument, so
pathetick in its Eloquence, and so moving and
perswasive, that as soon as the Judge read it,
he sent him Word he should be easie, for he
would Endeavour to make that Matter light to
him, and in a Word never left, till be obtained
to stop Prosecution, and restore him to his Li∣berty
and to his Family.</P>
<P>These Hints, I say, are of a Nature too signi∣ficant
to be neglected; whence they come is the
next Enquiry. I answer, They are the Whispers
of some subsisting Spirit communicated to the
Soul, without the Help of the Organ, without
the Assistance of a particular Sound, and with∣out
any other Communication; but take it as you
go, not without the merciful Disposition of that
Power, that governs that World, as well as this
that we are sensible of; How near those Spirits
are to us, who thus for<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce what concerns us,
and how they convey these Hints into our Minds
as well waking as sleeping, or how they are di∣rected,
that I could not discover, nor can yet re∣solve,
no not in the highest of my imaginary Ele∣vation,
any more than in what Manner they are
Limited and restrained.</P>
<P>I have been asked by some, to whom I have
talked freely of my frequent Applications to
these Things, If I knew any Thing by those
Observations, of the Manner of the Disposition of
human Soul after its Departure out of the Body?
I mean as to its middle State, and whether, as
some, it has a wandring Existence in the upper
Part of the Waste or Abyss near to, but not in
a present State of Felicity? Whether it is still
confined within the Atmosphere of the Earth
<PB N="51" REF="337"/>
according to others, as in a <HI>Limbus,</HI> or Purga∣tory;
or in the Circle of the Sun, as others say?
Whether I knew or perceived any Thing of our
Saviour's being ascended into the Body of the
Sun only, and not into the highest Heaven re∣ceiving
his redeemed Souls to himself, and in∣to
an Incorporation with his Glory there, <HI>till the
Restitution of all Things?</HI> Whether I perceived any
Thing of Satan being possessed of the reprobate
Souls as they departed; and of his Substitutes
as Executioners, being empowered and employ∣ed
to torment them according to the receiv∣ed
Notions of the wise Contemplators of such
Things.</P>
<P>I answered, as I do now, that not only no∣thing
of all this appears, but on the contrary, such
serious Contemplations as mine give a great and a∣bundant
Reason to be satified, that there is no∣thing
in it all but meer Dream and enthusiastick
Conjecture: I own that the Agents I mention∣ed,
make use of all those Things to terrify and
affright poor ignorant People out of their Senses,
and to drive them often into Desperation, and
after to restore them by a Cure that is worse
than the Distemper, namely, by a Hardness and
Coldness of Temper, rejecting entirely all the No∣tions
of Eternity and Futurity, and so fitting them
to go out of the World as they lived in it, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
without troubling themselves with what is to
come after it.</P>
<P>But I return to the Article of Impulses of the
Mind, for I lay greater Weight upon these than
upon any of the other Discoveries of the In∣visible
World, because they have something in
them relating to what we are about, some∣thing
directing, something to guide us in avoid∣ing
the evils that attend us, and to accepting, or
<PB N="52" REF="338"/>
rather embracing Opportunities of doing our∣selves
good when they present, which many
Times for want of the knowledge of our Way,
we irrecoverably let slip.</P>
<P>Voices, Apparitions, Noises, and all the o∣ther
affrighting Things, which unavoidably fol∣low
the Neighbourhood of Spirits in the Air
we breath in, seem to have much less Significa∣tion,
<HI>as to us,</HI> than these seasonable kind Whis∣pers
to our Souls, which it is plain, are directed
for the Advantage of Life.</P>
<P>It seems hard that Mankind should be so open
to the secret Insinuators the whispering Devils I
have been speaking of, who are Night and Day,
sleeping and waking, working upon his Senses by
the Arts and Subtilties of Hell, to fill his Ima∣gination
with a thousand devilish Contrivances
to gratify his Vanity and Lust; and that our
Thoughts should be always ready to receive the
Impressions they make, pressed to follow the
infernal Counsel, be awake to listen to all his
Directions, but should be deaf to the Instructions
of any kind Spirits that would influence us for our
Advantage, and insensible of those Impressions
which are made upon us for our immediate Good,
by an Agent Good in itself, and acting from a
Principle whatever it be, of Good to us.</P>
<P>We have a foolish Saying, though taken from
Something that is more significant than we ima∣gine
when any Danger has i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>prised us. Well,
<HI>my Mind misg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve me,</HI> when I was going about it:
Well, I knew some Mischief would come of it;
<HI>did you so?</HI> And why, than did you do it? Why
did you so on? Why, when <HI>your Mind misgave
you,</HI> did you not obey the friendly Caution?
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> do you think your Mind received the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Impression? Why did you
<PB N="53" REF="339"/>
not listen to it, <HI>as to a Voice?</HI> For such a one it
was no doubt; and let all those unthinking Peo∣ple
who go on in any Thing they are upon, con∣trary
to those secret silent Impressions upon their
Minds; I say, let them know and observe it,
they will very seldom fail of meeting some Mis∣chief
in the Way. They will very seldom fail of
miscarrying in the Way; <HI>I say very seldom,</HI> be∣cause
I would not take upon me to prescribe
Things positively, which the Reader will take
me up short in, and say, how do I know it? But
I will take the Liberty to say, I durst be posi∣tive
in it, relating to my self, and I durst be po∣sitive
from the Nature and Reason of the Thing.</P>
<P>As to my own Experience, I wave saying much
of it, but that in general I never slighted these
Impulses, but to my great Misfortune; I never
listen'd to and obey'd them, but to my great Ad∣vantage,
but I choose to argue from the Reason
of them, rather than from my own Experience.</P>
<P>As they are evident Warnings of what is to
come, and are testified daily and hourly by the
Things coming to pass afterwards, so they are
undeniable Testimonies, that they proceed from
some Being, intelligent of those Things that are
at Hand, while they are yet to come. If then
I am satisfied that it is a Notice given from a
Something, <HI>be it what it will,</HI> which is fully in∣form'd
of what is attending me, tho' conceal'd
from me; why should I slight the Hint given
me from any Thing that knows, what I know
not, and especially, for Example, for avoiding
Evils to come.</P>
<P>I know a Person, who had so strong an Impressi∣on
upon her Mind, that the House she was in
would be burnt that very Night, that she could
not go to sleep, the Impulse she had upon her
<PB N="54" REF="340"/>
Mind press'd her not to go to Bed, which how∣ever
she resisted and went to Bed, but was so
terrified with the Thought, which as she call'd
it, run in her Mind, that the House would be
burnt, that she could not go to sleep.</P>
<P>She had made so much Discovery of her Ap∣prehensions
in the Family, that they were all
in a Fright, and applied themselves to search
from the Top of the House to the Bottom, and
to see every Fire, and every Candle safe out, so
that, as they all said, it was impossible any
Thing could happen in the House, and they sent
to the Neighbours on both Sides to do the like.
Thus far they did well, but had she obeyed the
Hint, which prest upon her strangely not to go
to Bed, she had done much better, for the Fire
was actually kindled at that very Time, tho' not
broken out.</P>
<P>In about an Hour, after the whole Family was
in Bed, the House just over the Way, directly
opposite, was all in a Flame, and the Wind
which was very high, blowing the Flame upon
the House this Gentlewoman lived in, so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it
with Smoke and Fire in a few Moments, the
Street being Narrow, that they had not Air to
breath, or Time to do any Thing, but jump
out of their Beds and save their Lives; had she
obey'd the Hint given, and not gone to Bed, she
might have saved several Things of Value,
which she lost; but as she neglected that, and
would go to Bed, the Moments she had spar'd
to her, were but just sufficient to get out of Bed,
get some Cloaths on, and get down Stairs, for
the House was on Fire in half Quarter of an
Hour.</P>
<P>It might be ask'd here, why could not the
same kind Spirit have intimated by the same
<PB N="55" REF="341"/>
Whispers, where the Danger lay, and from what
Quarter it was to be expected; in what Man∣ner
the Fire would attack them, and that it
would come from the other Side of the Street,
the Wind blowing it directly upon them?</P>
<P>To this, I answer, that it is our Business the
more vigilantly to observe and listen to the Hints
which are given, seeing the Intimations are not
so Particular as we might wish, without enqui∣ring
into the Reasons, why they are given no
plainer. We have a great deal of Reason to be∣lieve
the kind Spirit that gives these Intimations
and Whispers, thus to us, gives us all the Light
it is permitted to give, and whispers as much,
either as it knows, or as it is allow'd to commu∣nicate;
otherwise, why does it give any Inti∣mations
at all? But on the other Hand, it may
be alledg'd, that enough is intimated to suffice
for our Safety, if we will obey the Intimation;
and it would be a much more reasonable Que∣stion,
to ask, why we slight and disobey the im∣pression
that we acknowledge to have received,
rather than why the Intimation was no plainer.</P>
<P>A Person of my Acquaintance being to go to
<HI>New-England</HI> by Sea, two Ships presented, and
the Masters earnestly solicited to take him as a
Passenger; he asked my Advice, professing, that
as well the Ships, as the Captains, were perfect∣ly
indifferent to him, both the Men being equally
agreeable to him, and the Vessels equally good.
I had my Eye upon this Notion of Impulses, and
prest him to observe strictly, if he had not some
secret Motion of his Mind to one Ship rather
than another, and he said he had not.</P>
<P>After some Time he accidentally met one of
the Captains, and falling into Terms with him,
agreed for his Passage, and accordingly prepar'd
<PB N="56" REF="342"/>
to go on board; but from the very Time that
he made the Agreement, nay, even while he was
making the Bargain, he had a strong Impression
on his Mind, that he should not go in that
Ship.</P>
<P>It was some Days after this, that he told me
of these Impressions, which increas'd on him e∣very
Day; upon which I prest him earnestly not
to go, but to take Passage with the other. Af∣ter
he had resolv'd upon this, the came to me,
and told me, that he had with some Difficulty,
and some Loss, put off the first Ship, but that
now he had the same, or rather stronger Aversi∣on
to going in the second Ship, and had a strong
Impression on his Mind, that if he went in the
second Ship he should be drowned; I bid him
consider it a little, and tell me if he had any
farther Intimations of it; and he continued to
tell me, that he had no Rest about his going in
either of those Ships, and yet his Affairs lay so,
that he was under a Necessity of going, and
there was no other Ship put up upon the <HI>Ex∣change</HI>
for going.</P>
<P>I press'd him, however, not to venture by any
Means; I convinc'd him, that those Impulses of
his Mind were the Whispers of some kind Spi∣rit,
that saw Things farther than he could, and
were certainly given him as Cautions to save
him from some Mischief which the might not
foresee; that it could be no evil Spirit, because
the keeping him back could be no Injury to
him, of such a Nature as would gratify the De∣vil
in any Part of his usual Desires; it must there∣fore
be something for his Good, and he ought
to be very cautious how he slighted the silent Ad∣monition.
In a Word, I prepossess'd him so much
in aid of the secret Impulses of his own Mind,
<PB N="57" REF="343"/>
that he resolved not to go that Year, and he
saw clearly afterwards, that the secret Intimati∣mation
was from a good Hand, for both the
Ships miscarried; the first being taken by the
<HI>Turks,</HI> and the latter cast away and all the Men
lost, the Ship foundring at Sea, as was suppos'd,
for she was never heard of.</P>
<P>I could fill this Tract with Accounts of this
Nature, but the Reason of the Case is stronger
than the Example; for as it is an Intimation of
something future, and that is to come to pass, it is
certain, there is a State in which what is Future
and must come to pass is known, and why should
we not believe the News, if it comes from the
Place where the Certainty of it is known?</P>
<P>Some give all this to a Prescience peculiar to
the Soul it self, and of kin to that we call the
<HI>Second Sight;</HI> but I see no Ground for this, but
mere Presumption. Others call it an <HI>Afflatus,</HI>
which they think is a Distemper of the Brain.
Others call it a <HI>Sympathetick Power in the Soul,</HI>
foreboding its own Disasters. But all this is
short of the Thing, for here is not a Foreboding
only, which indeed is often felt, but is express'd
another Way; but here is a direct Intelligence; a
plain Intimation of the Evil, and warning to a∣void
it: This must be more than an <HI>Afflatus,</HI> more
than a <HI>Sympathy;</HI> this must be from a certain
Knowledge of a Thing that <HI>exists not,</HI> by a Some∣thing
that <HI>does exist;</HI> and must be communicated
by a Converse of Spirits unembodied, with the
Spirit embodied, for its Good; unless you will
call it <HI>Divine Revelation,</HI> which I see no Ground
for.</P>
<P>All these Reasonings make it abundantly our
Concern to regard these Things, as what we are
greatly concern'd in; However that is not the chief
<PB N="58" REF="344"/>
Use I make of them here, but (1.) they abundantly
explain the Nature of the World of Spirits, and
the Certainty of an Existence after Death; (2.)
they confirm that the Disposition of Providence
concerning Man, and the Event of Things, are
not so much hidden from the Inhabitants of that
World as they are from us; as also (3.) that Spirits
unembodied see with a Sight differing from us,
and are capable of knowing what attends us,
when we know nothing of it our selves.</P>
<P>This offer'd many useful Reflections to my
Mind, which, however, 'ti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> impossible for me to
communicate with the same Vivacity, or to ex∣press
with the same Life, that the Impression
they make on my own Thoughts came with.</P>
<P>1. The Knowledge of there being a World of
Spirits, may be many Ways useful to us, and especially
that of their seeing into Futurity, so as to
be able to communicate to us, by what Means so∣ever
they do it, what we shall, or shall not do,
or what shall, or shall not befall us; to communi∣cate
Dangers before us, so as they may be avoided,
and Mischiefs awaiting us, so as they may be pre∣vented,
and even Death it self, so as we may pre∣pare
for it; For we may certainly, if we would at∣tend
to these Things, encrease our Acquaintance
with them, and that very much to our Advantage.</P>
<P>I would be far from prompting the crazy Imagina∣tions
of Hypocondriac Distemper'd Heads, which
run Men out to so many Extravagancies, and which
in fixing their Thoughts upon the real World
of Spirits, make <HI>this</HI> an imaginary World of Spi∣rits
to them; who think they are talk'd to from
the invisible World, by the Howling of every Dog,
or the Screeching of every Owl. I believe it was
much of this vapourish dreaming Fancy, by which
the <HI>Augurs</HI> of the <HI>Romans</HI> determin'd Events from the
<PB N="59" REF="345"/>
Flying of Birds, and the Entrails of Beasts. It will
be hard for me to be prevail'd on to suppose,
that even those intelligent Spirits which I speak of,
who are able by such easy Ways, as the Impul∣ses
of our Minds, Dreams, and the like, to con∣vey
the Knowledge of Things to us, can be put
to the Necessity, or find Reason to make Use of
the Agency of Dogs and Birds, to convey their
Notices by; this would be to suppose them to
be much more confin'd in their Converse with us,
than we evidently find they are; and on the other
Hand would suppose the inanimate World to have
more Knowledge of the invisible, than we have,
whereas on the other Hand we know they have no∣thing
at all to do with it.</P>
<P>There is only this to be said for it, namely,
that those inanimate Creatures do it involunta∣rily,
and as it were, under the Power of a Pos∣session.</P>
<P>I will not affirm, but that the invisible Inhabi∣tants
I have been speaking of, may have Power to
act upon the brute Creatures, so as to employ
them, or make use of their Agency in the Warn∣ings
and Notices which they give to us of Things
to come; but that the Brutes have otherwise a∣ny
farther Sight of Things than we have, I can
see nothing at all of that. It is true, <HI>Balaam</HI>'s
Ass saw the Angel with the flaming Sword, stan∣ding
in the Road, when the Prophet did not,
but the Reason is plainly express'd; the Angel
was really there, and actually presenting Terror
to them with a flaming Sword in his Hand, on∣ly
the Prophets Eyes were miraculously witheld,
that he could not see him.</P>
<P>I shall unriddle this Mystery of the Agency of
Beasts, and Birds, as far as Reason dictates;
and it seems to be Easy upon the Scheme of the
<PB N="60" REF="346"/>
Nearness of the Spirits I am speaking of to us,
and their Concern to convey Intelligence to us:
They may, I say, have Power to Terrify the
Brutes by horrible Apparitions to them, so as to
force those Howlings and Screichings we have
been told of, and to do this in such Places, and
at such Times as shall suit with the Circumstances
of the Family or Person concern'd, and so far
their said extraordinary Howlings and Screichings
may be significant; but that the Brutes can ei∣ther
by Sense, or by extraordinary Sight have any
Foreknowledge of Things in Futurity relating to
us, or to themselves; this has no Foundation in
Reason or Philosophy any more than it has in Re∣ligion.
Matter may act upon material Objects,
and so the Understanding or Sense of a Brute
may act upon visible Objects, but Matter cannot
act upon immaterial Things, and so the Eye of a
Beast cannot see a Spirit, or the Mind of a Brute
act upon Futurity, Eternity, and the sublime
Things of a State to come.</P>
<P>What Use then the Spirits we speak of, inhabi∣ting
the invisible World, can make of the inani∣mate
World to direct them, as Missionaries to us,
I do not see, neither did I in all my Altitudes
perceive they employ'd any such Agents.</P>
<P>It is from the Misunderstanding of these Things
that we place abundance of Incidents meerly for∣tuitous
to the Devils Account, which he knows
nothing of; many a Storm blows that is none
of his raising; many a Mid-night Noise hap∣pens
that is none of his making; if Satan or his
Instruments had one Tenth Part of the Pow∣er,
either of the Air, or in the Air, or over the
Elements, that we give them in our Imginations,
we should have our Houses burnt every Night,
Hurricanes raised in the Air, Floods made in the
<PB N="61" REF="347"/>
Country, and in a Word, the World would not
be habitable: But you remember I told you, as
powerful as he is, he is chain'd, he has a great
Clog at his Foot, and he can do nothing by Vio∣lence,
or without Permission.</P>
<P>I might hint here at abundance of idle ridicu∣lous
Devils, that we are daily told of, that come
and only make Game among us, put out our Can∣dles,
throw Chairs and Stools about the House,
break Glasses, make a Smoak, a Stink of Brim∣stone,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> whereas after all, the Devil has no
more Sulphur about him than other Folks, and I
can answer for it, that Satan is not disposed for
Mirth; all the Frolicks and Gambols we ascribe
to him, I dare say, are Anticks of our own Brain.</P>
<P>I heard of a House in <HI>Essex,</HI> which they told me
was haunted, and that every Night the Devil or
a Spirit, call it which you will, came into such a
Room, and made a most terrible Knocking, as if
it had a Hammer or a Mallet, and this for two
or three Hours together: At length, upon looking
about in an empty Closet in that Room, there
was found an old Mallet, and this was presently
concluded to be the Mallet which the Devil made
such a Noise with, so it was taken away: But
the next Night they said, the Devil made such a
Racket for want of the Mallet, that they were
much more disturb'd than before, so they were ob∣liged
to leave the Mallet there again, and every
Night the Devil would come and knock in the
Window, for two or three Hours together with
that Mallet. I have seen the Room, and the
Mallet, in neither of which was any Thing ex∣traordinary,
but never heard the Noise, though
I sat up to wait for it; nor after causing the Mal∣let
to be taken away, was there any Noise; be∣like
<PB N="62" REF="348"/>
the mannerly Spirit would not disturb us who
were Strangers.</P>
<P>This pass'd for a most eminent Piece of Walk∣ing
or Haunting, and all the Difficulty was to
enquire, to what Purpose all this Disturbance was
made, seeing there was no End answered in it,
and I always thought the Devil was too full of
Business to spend his Time to no manner of Pur∣pose.</P>
<P>At last, all the Cheat was discovered, <HI>viz.</HI> that
a Monkey kept in a House three or four Houses
from it, had found the Way into that Room,
and came every Night almost about Midnight,
and diverted himself with the Frolick, and then
went Home again.</P>
<P>If these Things were not frequently detected,
it would be a great Scandal upon the Devil, that
he had nothing to employ himself in, more signi∣ficant,
than Rapping all Night with a Hammer
to fright and disturb the Neighbours, making
Noises, putting out Candles, and the like: When
we come into the invisible State, of which we
now know so little, we shall be easily convinced,
that the Devil is otherwise employ'd, and has Bu∣siness
of much more Importance upon his Hands.</P>
<P>It would be very insignificant, to have us so fre∣quently
warned against Satans Devices, to have us
be caution'd to be sober and vigilant, knowing that
our Adversary the Devil, goes about like a roar∣ing
Lion, seeking, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> All these Things import,
that he is diligent in attacking us, watching all
Advantages, hunting us down, circumventing,
waiting, and constantly plying us with Snares that
he may trapan and devour us: This admits not
any of those simple, ludicrous, and senseless Di∣gressions,
which we set him to work upon in our
Imaginations.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="349"/>
Perhaps, it may be expected I should enter here
upon the Subject of Apparitions, and discourse
with equal Certainty of that yet undecided Que∣stion,
concerning the Reality of Apparitions,
and whether departed Souls can revisit the Place
of their former Existence, take up Shapes, Bodies,
and visible and apparent Beings, assume Voices, and
concern themselves with the Affairs of Life, of
Families, Persons, and even of Estates, and the
like, as many have affirmed they have been Wit∣nesses
to.</P>
<P>I must be allowed to leave this where I find it;
there are some Difficulties which I am not yet got
over in it, nor have I been elevated high enough
to determine that Point, and shall not venture to
decide it, without more certainty than I am yet
arriv'd to.</P>
<P>I would warn all People not to suffer their Ima∣gination,
to form Shapes and Appearances where
there are none; and I may take upon me to say,
that the Devil himself does not appear half so of∣ten,
as some People think they see him; Fancy go∣verns
many People, and a sick Brain forms strange
Things to itself: But it does not follow from
thence that nothing can appear, because nothing
does at that Time.</P>
<P>However, as my Design is to instruct, not a∣muse,
so I say, I forbear to enter upon a Subject,
which I must leave as doubtful as I find it, and
consequently talk of to no Purpose.</P>
<P>I have heard of a Man that would allow the
Reality of Apparitions, but would have it be no∣thing
but the Devil, that the Souls of Men de∣parted
or good Spirits never appeared, it happen'd
that to this very Man something appear'd, as he said,
and insisted upon it to the last: He said he saw
the Shape of an ancient Man pass by him in the
<PB N="64" REF="350"/>
Dusk of the Evening, who holding up his Hand,
as it were in a threatning Posture, said aloud, <HI>O
wicked Creature, repent, repent.</HI> He was exceedingly
terrified, and consulted several People about it,
who all advised him seriously to take the Advice;
for his Life made it well known it seems, that he
stood in need of it: But being seriously debating
about it, one of his Friends asked what he thought
of the Apparition, and whether it was any of the
Devils Business to bid him <HI>Repent;</HI> this puzzled
his Thoughts, and in a Word, he grew a very so∣ber
Man: But after all, it was a real Man, and no
Apparition that spoke to him, though his frighted
Fancy made him affirm that he vanish'd out of his
Sight, which he did not. And the Person who
did it, being a Grave and pious Gentleman, met
him by mere Accident without any Design, and
spoke as he did, from the Knowledge he had of his
being indeed a most wretched wicked Fellow: By
the Way, the Gentleman had the Opportunity to
hear the Use that was made of it, and to hear
himself mistaken for an Apparition of the Devil,
but he was so prudent as not to discover it to the
Man, lest the Reformation, which was the Con∣sequence
of the Fright, should wear off, when he
should know, that there was nothing in the Thing
but what was common.</P>
<P>If we would always make the like good Use of
<HI>Satan</HI>'s real Appearances, I do not know but it
would go a great Way to banish him from the vi∣sible
World; for I am well assur'd he would very
seldom visit us, if he thought his Com<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng would
do us any Good; at least he would never come,
but when he was sent, he would never come wil∣lingly:
For he is so absolutely at the Divine Dis∣posal,
that if Heaven Commands, he must go,
though it were to do the good he abhors; not
<PB N="63" REF="351"/>
that I believe Heaven ever thinks fit to employ him
in doing Good, if ever he is let loose, 'tis to act in
Judgment as an Instrument of Vengeance, and
some are of Opinion, he is often employed as
a destroying Angel, tho' I do not grant that; I can
hardly think the Justice of God would gratify
Satan's Gust of doing Evil, so far as to suffer him
to be even so much as an Executioner: But that is
by the Way.</P>
<P>I have another Turn to give this Part of my
Observations, which tho' perhaps some may not
think so much to the Purpose, as entring into
a critical Enquiry after the Devils particular
Mission in these Cases: Yet I think otherwise.</P>
<P>I have observ'd, that some desperate People
make a very ill use of the general Notion, that there
are no Apparitions, nor Spirits at all; and really
the Use they make of it, is worse than the ex∣treme
of those, who, as I said, make Visions
and Devils of every Thing they see or hear:
For these Men persuade themselves there are no
Spirits at all, either in the visible or invisible
World, and carrying it on farther, they next an∣nihilate
the Devil, and believe nothing about
him, either of one kind or another.</P>
<P>This would not be of so much bad Consequence,
if it was not always followed by a worse; namely,
that when they have prevailed with themselves to
believe there is no Devil, the next Thing is, and
they soon come to it, <HI>That there is no God,</HI> and so
Atheism takes its rise in the same Sink, with a
Carelesness about Futurity.</P>
<P>I have no Mind to enter upon an Argument to
prove the being of our Maker, and to illustrate
his Power by Words, who has so many undeniable
Testimonies in the Breasts of every rational Being
to prove his Existence: But I have a Mind to con∣clude
<PB N="64" REF="352"/>
this Work with a short History of some A∣theists,
which I met with many Years ago,
and whether the Facts are testified or not, may
be equally useful in the Application, if you do
not think them a little too Religious for you.</P>
<P>Some Years ago, there was a young Gentleman,
a Scholar at the University, eminent for Learn∣ing
and Vertue, of prompt Parts, and great Pro∣ficiency,
insomuch that he was taken great No∣tice
of by the Masters and Fellows, and every
one promised fair in their Thoughts for him, that
he would be a great Man. It happened, whe∣ther
from his earnest Desire of more Knowledge,
or the Opinion of his own great Capacity, I know
not which; that this Gentleman falling upon the
Study of Divinity, grew so opinionative, so very
positive and dogmatic in his Notions in religious
Things, that by Degrees it came to this Height,
that his Tutor saw plainly, he had little more than
Notions in all his religious Pretences to Know∣ledge,
and concluded, he would either grow
Enthusiastic or obstinately Profane and Athei∣stick.</P>
<P>He had three <HI>Chums</HI> or Companions in his Stu∣dies,
and they all fell into the same Error, as well
by the Consequence of a great deal of Wit and
little Grace, as by the Example and Leading of
this other young Gentleman, who was indeed
their Oracle, almost in every Thing.</P>
<P>As his Tutor who was a very good Man, fear'd
for him, so it came to pass with him, and all the
rest; for they ran up their superficial Notions in
Divinity to such a Height, that instead of Rea∣soning
themselves into good Principles of Reli∣gion,
they really reason'd themselves out of all
Religion whatsoever; running on to expunge
every right Idea from their Minds, pretending those
<PB N="65" REF="353"/>
Things really <HI>were not,</HI> of which they could not
define both how and what <HI>they were;</HI> they pro∣ceeded
to deny the Existence of their Maker, the
Certainty of a future State, a Resurrection, a Judg∣ment,
a Heaven, or a Hell.</P>
<P>They were not contented to satisfie themselves
with these impious Foundations, but they set up
to dispute in private Societies against all revealed
Religion; there by bringing on themselves the Curse
denounced in Scripture against those, that do Evil
and <HI>teach Men so to do;</HI> in a little Time they grew
so publick, that more Company came in, and
which was worse, many joined with them in
Principle, or as I should rather have said, in cast∣ing
off all Principles, and they began to be famous
in the Place, <HI>though to the Offence of all good Men,</HI>
and were call'd, <HI>The Atheistical Club.</HI></P>
<P>They soon began to see sober, religious People shun
them, and in some Time, upon Information given,
they were obliged by Authority, to separate for
Fear of Punishment, so that they could not hold
their publick Disputations, as they began to do;
yet they abated nothing of their wicked Custom;
and this dreadful Creature, who set up at the
Head of the rest, began to be so open in his
Blasphemies, that he was at Length oblig'd to fly
from the University.</P>
<P>However, he went a great while before it came
to that; and though he had been often admonish∣ed,
yet instead of reclaiming, he grew the more
impious, making the most Sacred Things his
Jest, and the Subject of his Ridicule: He gave
out, That he could frame a new Gospel, and a
much better <HI>System</HI> of Religion, than that which
they call'd <HI>Christian;</HI> and that if he would trouble
himself to go about it, he would not fail to draw
in as great a Part of the World to run after him,
<PB N="66" REF="354"/>
as had been after <HI>any other.</HI> I care not to repeat
any of his blasphemous Words, it is not to be
supposed there can be any blasphemous abominable
Thing, that this Set of wicked wretched young
Men did not run into, neither any Wicked∣ness
of that kind within their Reach, which they
did not commit.</P>
<P>It would be too long to enter into the particu∣lar
History of these Men, and how it pleased
God to dispose of them; they might be in Number
before they separated about twenty-two in all, I
shall tell you of some of them however, who did
not run such Lengths as the rest: There was a
young Man, who frequented their Society, though
<HI>as he afterwards said,</HI> he was rather persuaded to
be <HI>among them,</HI> than to be <HI>one of them;</HI> he had
however too much yielded to their Delusions;
and though they made him very much their Jest,
because they found he still retained some little Sense
of a God, and of a future State in his Mind, yet
he had yielded dreadfully to them, and began to do
so more and more every Day.</P>
<P>It happen'd one Day, this young Man was going
to their hellish Society, and not minding the Wea∣ther,
the Clouds gathered over his Head, and he
was stopp'd by a sudden Shower of Rain in the
Street: It rained so very hard, that it obliged him
to stand up in the Gate-way of an Inn for some
Time; while he was standing here, a great Flash
of Lightning more than ordinarily surpriz'd him;
it seems the Fire coming so directly in his Face,
that he felt the very Warmth of it, and was ex∣ceedingly
startled; in the same Moment almost,
<HI>as is natural in the Case,</HI> followed such a Clap of
Thunder that perfectly astonished him. The Rain
continuing, kept him in the Gate-way, as I said, for a
good While, till he had Time for such Reflections,
<PB N="67" REF="355"/>
as these, <HI>Where am I going! What am I going about!
Who is it has stopt me thus! Why are these Thunders,
these Rains, and this Lightning thus Terrible? and whence
are they!</HI> and with the rest came in this Thought,
warm and swift as the Lightning, which had terri∣fied
him before, <HI>What if there should be a God! What
will become of me then!</HI> Terrified with these Things,
he starts out of the <HI>Gate-way</HI> into the Street not∣withstanding
the Wet, and runs back through the
Rain, saying to himself as he went, <HI>I will go among
them no more!</HI> When he came Home to his Cham∣bers,
he fell into dreadful Agonies of Mind, and at
length broke out thus: <HI>What have I been doing! have I
been denying the Power that made me! Despising that
God whose Five flash'd just now in my Face! And
which, had not that Mercy I have abused interposed,
might have burnt me to Death! What kind of Creature
am I!</HI> While he was thus giving vent to his Re∣flections,
a near Relation of his, a pious good
Man, who had often used to speak very plain∣ly
to him of the horrid Sin he was guilty of, hap∣pened
to come to visit him.</P>
<P>The young Man had thrown himself upon his
Bed, and had with the deepest Sense of his Mad∣ness,
and most serious Reproaches of himself for
his horrid Life, been expressing himself to his
Friend, and he had been comforting him in the
best Manner he could, when after a while he desir'd
his Friend to retire, that he might be a little alone,
and might give vent to his Thoughts with the
more Freedom, and his Friend, taking a Book in
his Hand, staid in the outer Room.</P>
<P>In this Interval came another Scholar to the
Door, who was one of the wicked Company I
mention'd just now: He came not to visit this
first Gentleman, but to call him to go with him to
the usual Meeting of their dreadful Society. And
<PB N="68" REF="356"/>
knocking at his Chamber Door; this Gentleman,
who was left in the Chamber, stept to the Door,
and looking through a little Grate, not only knew
the Person, but knew him to be one of the wicked
Company I have been speaking of: Now as he
was very loath, his Friend should have such an In∣terruption
to the good Disposition he was then in,
so above all, he was loth he should be persuaded
to go any more among that miserable Gang;
wherefore he opened the Door a little Way, so
as he was not very distinctly seen, and speaks aloud
in the Person of his Friend thus: O SIR, <HI>Beseech
them all to repent;</HI> for depend upon it, <HI>There is a</HI>
GOD, tell them, <HI>I say so;</HI> and with that he shut
the Door upon him violently, giving him no Time
to reply, and going back into his Friends Room,
took no Notice of any Body having been at the
Door at all.</P>
<P>The Person who knocked at the Door, you may
suppose, was one of the Leaders of the Company,
a young Scholar of good Parts and Sense, but de∣bauch'd
by that horr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Crew; and one that
had made himself eminent, for his declar'd Oppo∣sition
to all the common Notions of Religion; a
complete Atheist and publickly so, without God
or the Desire of God in the World: However,
(<HI>as he afterwards confessed</HI>) the Repulse he met with
at the Door, <HI>and which he thought came from his
Friend,</HI> gave him a strange Shock at first, and fill'd
him with Horror: He went down the College-Stairs
in the greatest Confusion imaginable, and
went musing along a good Way, not knowing
where he was, or whither he went, and in that
Embarrassment of Thought went a whole Street
out of the Way; the Words had made an unusual
Impression upon his Mind, but he had his other
Surprises too; for he Thought his Friend, <HI>for he
<PB N="69" REF="357"/>
believ'd firmly, that it was he that had spoken to him,</HI>
had treated him very rudely.</P>
<P>Sometimes he resented it, and reflected upon it
as an Affront, and once or twice was upon the
Point of going back again to him, to know the
Reason of his using him so, and to demand Satis∣faction:
But still the Words, THERE IS A GOD,
dwelt upon his Mind, <HI>and what if it should be so?</HI>
says he, <HI>what then?</HI> Upon this Question to him∣self,
the Answer immediately occurr'd to his Mind,
<HI>what then! why, then I am undone;</HI> for, <HI>have not
I declar'd War against the very Notion, defy'd all the
Pretenders to it, as mere Enthusias<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and Men of
Whimsy?</HI> However, after these Thoughts his
Mind cool'd a little again, and it offered to him,
<HI>no doubt injected by an Evil Spirit,</HI> that he should not
trouble himself with enquiring into it one Way or
another, but <HI>be easy.</HI></P>
<P>This pacified him for a little While, and he
shook off the Surprise he was in; the hardned
Temper seem'd to return, and he kept on his Way
towards the hellish Society, that he was going to
before: But still the Words returned upon him,
THERE IS A GOD, and began to bring
some Terror with it upon his Mind; and the
last Words of his Friend came into his Mind often,
<HI>tell them, I say so,</HI> this fill'd him with a Curiosity
which he could not withstand; <HI>viz.</HI> of going back
to his Friend, and enquiring of him, what Disco∣veries
he had made of this Kind? how he came to
have changed his Mind of suddenly? and especially,
how he was arrived to a Certainty of the Thing?</P>
<P>I told you, that there had been a great Shower
of Rain, which had stopp'd the first young Gen∣tleman
in his Way out; it seems the Day was still
showery and a little Rain happening to fall again,
as this Gentleman went by a Bookseller's Shop,</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="358"/>
he stops at the Door to stand up a little out of
the wet.</P>
<P>There happens to be sitting in the Shop reading
a Book, a Gentleman of his Acquaintance, though
far differing from him in his Principles, being a
very sober, studious, religious young Man, a Stu∣dent
in Divinity of the same College, who look∣ing
up called him in, and after a few common Sa∣lutes,
he whispers in his Ear.</P>

I resolv'd never to come into Company with ei∣ther
of you again, and it was that very Discourse,
that made me think of you when I found those
Lines in this Book; I should think it an evident
Discovery of God, and what I might hope should
best forward your Conviction, if his Providence
should have sent you to this Door at that Minute,
to receive the Hint on this Occasion.</P>

height of Sinning. The Devil has frequently set
up himself, and persuaded poor deluded People to
worship him as a God; but <HI>to do him Justice,</HI> he
never had the Impudence to deny the Being of a
God; that's a Sin purely Human, and even among

Men, <HI>as they call themselves;</HI> a Way they have late∣ly
found out to cherish superlative Wickedness,

Persons so eminently concurr'd in speak∣ing
to you, you cannot believe God would bid you

<P>I cannot deny but my Heart always struck

<P>The greater is that Love which refuses to
be shut out, that sends such a heavenly Summons
to you to repent, and in so eminent a Manner; it
is not your having been an Enemy, a Blasphemer,
a Denyer of God; <HI>Peter</HI> denied Christ three

<P>I beseech you unriddle yourself, for I am

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ath.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, about three a Clock this Afternoon,
I came to this Chamber-Door; I knock'd; you
came and open'd the Door; I began to speak, you
interrupted me, and—</P>
</SP>
<Q>Here he repeats the Passage a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> large,
and his own Thoughts, and Resent∣ment
as before.</Q>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>Depend upon it, 'twas some Voice from
Heaven, it was nothing of mine; I have not been
at the Door since two of the Clock, when I came
first in, but have been on the Bed or in my Study
ever since, wholly taken up with my own Thoughts,
and very much indispos'd.</P>
</SP>
<Q>The young Man turns Pale, and falls
into a Swound.</Q>
<P>There was a great deal more belonging to this
Story, but 'tis too long for the present Purpose, I
have related this Part on several Accounts, and it
hits the Purpose I am upon many Ways.</P>
<P>1. Here is a visible Evidence of God, and of
his Being and Nature fix'd so in the Mind,
that not the most hardn'd Atheist can deny it,
Nature recoils at every Endeavour to sup∣press
it, and the very Pulsation of his Blood
shall discover and acknowledge it.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="371"/>
2. Yet even in this, we see how the Power of
Imagination may be work'd up, by the se∣cret
Agency of an unknown Hand, how ma∣ny
Things concurr'd to make this Man be∣lieve
he had seen an Apparition, and heard
a Voice, and yet there was nothing in it
but the Voice of a Man unseen and mistaken;
the young Man was so surprised at his
Friends declaring that he knew nothing of
his coming there, that he concluded it had
been all a Vision or Apparition that opened
the Door, and that it was a Voice that had
spoken to him, of what Kind he knew not;
and the Reflection upon this surprised him so
much as threw him into a Swound, and yet
here was neither Vision or Voice, but that
of an ordinary Person, and one who meant
well, and said well.</P>
<P>It is not to be doubted, but that many an Ap∣parition
related with a great deal of Certainty
in the World, and of which good Ends have fol∣low'd,
has been no more than such a serious Mi∣stake
as this.</P>
<P>But before I leave it, let me observe, that this
should not at all hinder us from making a very
good Use of such Things; for many a Voice may
be directed from Heaven, that is not immediately
spoken from thence; as when the Children cried
<HI>Hosannah</HI> to our Saviour, they fulfilled the Scrip∣ture,
which said out of the Mouths of Babes and
Sucklings thou hast ordain'd Praise; so doubtless
he that made all Things and created all Things;
may appoint Instruction to be given by fortuitous
Accidents, and may direct concurring Circum∣stances
to touch and affect the Mind as much, and
as effectually, as if they had been immediate and
miraculous.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="372"/>
Thus was the two Persons happening to say the
same Words to the Atheist, the strange reading of
those Lines, when the Person came into the Book∣seller's
Shop, the incident of his running into the
Shop for Shelter, and many the like Things of the
same Nature, and order'd in the same Manner as
the Cock crowing when <HI>Peter</HI> denied Christ, which
though wonderfully concurrent with what his
blessed Master had foretold, yet was no extraor∣dinary
Thing in a Cock, who naturally Crows at
such a Time of the Morning.</P>
<P>In a Word, all these Things serve to convince
us of a great Super-intendency of Divine Provi∣dence
in the minutest Affairs of this World, of a
manifest Existence of the invisible World, of the
Reality of Spirits, and of the Intelligence between
us and them. I hope I have said nothing of it to
mis-guide any Body, or to assist them to delude
themselves, having spoken of it with the utmost Se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riousness
in my Design, and with a sincere Desire
for a General Good.</P>
