<HEAD>TO
DOCTOR ******</HEAD>
<P>YOU and I, my good friend, have
often deliberated on the difficulty of
writing such a Dedication as might
gratify the self-complacency of a patron,
without exposing the author to the ridicule
or censure of the public; and I think we
generally agreed that the task was altogether
impracticable.—Indeed, this was one of the
few subjects on which we have always
thought in the same manner: for notwith∣standing
that deference and regard which
we mutually pay to each other, certain it
is, we have often differed, according to the
predominancy of those different passions,
which frequently warp the opinion, and
perplex the understanding of the most ju∣dicious.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="3"/>
In Dedication as in Poetry, there is no
medium: for, if any one of the human virtues
be omitted in the enumeration of the pa∣tron's
good qualities; the whole address is
construed into an affront, and the writer has
the mortification to find his praise prosti∣tuted
to very little purpose.</P>
<P>On the other hand, should he yield to
the transports of gratitude or affection which
is always apt to exaggerate, and produce
no more than the genuine effusions of his
heart, the world will make no allowance
for the warmth of his passion, but ascribe
the praise he bestows, to interested views
and sordid adulation.</P>
<P>Sometimes too, dazzled by the tinsel of
a character which he has no opportunity to
investigate, he pours forth the homage of his
admiration, upon some false Maecenas, whose
future conduct gives the lie to his eulogi∣um,
and involves him in shame and con∣fusion
of face. Such was the fate of a late
ingenious<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author of the SEASONS.</NOTE> author, who was so often put to
the blush for the undeserved incense he had
offered, in the heat of an enthusiastic dispo∣sition,
misled by popular applause, that he
had resolved to retract in his last will, all
<PB N="iii" REF="4"/>
the encomiums which he had thus prema∣turely
bestowed, and stigmatize the unwor∣thy
by name: a laudable scheme of poeti∣cal
justice, the execution of which was fa∣tally
prevented by untimely death.</P>
<P>Whatever may have been the sate of other
Dedicators, I, for my own part, sit down
to write this address, without any apprehen∣sion
of disgrace or disappointment; because
I know you are too well convinced of my
affection and sincerity to repine at what I
shall say touching your character and con∣duct:
and you will do me the justice to be∣lieve,
that this public distinction is a tes∣timony
of my particular friendship and
esteem.</P>
<P>Not that I am either insensible of your
infirmities, or disposed to conceal them from
the notice of mankind. There are certain
foibles which can only be cured by shame
and mortification; and whether or not yours
be of that species, I shall have the comfort
to think my best endeavours were used for
your reformation.</P>
<P>Know then, I can despise your pride,
while I honour your integrity; and applaud
your taste, while I am shocked at your
ostentation.—I have known you trifling,
superficial and obstinate in dispute; meanly
<PB N="iv" REF="5"/>
jealous and aukwardly reserved; rash and
haughty in your resentments; and coarse and
lowly in your connexions.—I have blushed
at the weakness of your conversation, and
trembled at the errors of your conduct.—Yet,
as I own you possess certain good qua∣lities,
which over-balance these defects, and
distinguish you on this occasion, as a person
for whom I have the most perfect attach∣ment
and esteem, you have no cause to
complain of the indelicacy with which your
faults are reprehended: and as they are
chiefly the excesses of a sanguine disposition
and looseness of thought, impatient of cau∣tion
or controul; you may, thus stimulated,
watch over your own intemperance and in∣firmity,
with redoubled vigilance and con∣sideration,
and for the future profit by the
severity of my reproof.</P>
<P>These, however, are not the only mo∣tives
that induce me to trouble you with
this public application. I must not only per∣form
my duty to my friends, but also dis∣charge
the debt I owe to my own interest.
We live in a censorious age; and an author
cannot take too much precaution to anti∣cipate
the prejudice, misapprehension and
temerity of malice, ignorance and presump∣tion.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="6"/>
I therefore think it incumbent upon me,
to give some previous intimation of the
plan which I have executed in the subse∣quent
performance, that I may not be con∣demned
upon partial evidence; and to
whom can I with more propriety appeal in
my explanation, than to you, who are so well
acquainted with all the sentiments and emo∣tions
of my breast?</P>
<P>A Novel is a large diffused picture, com∣prehending
the characters of life, disposed
in different groupes, and exhibited in va∣rious
attitudes, for the purposes of an uni∣form
plan, and general occurrence, to
which every individual figure is subservient.
But this plan cannot be executed with pro∣priety,
probability or success, without a
principal personage to attract the attention,
unite the incidents, unwind the clue of the
labyrinth, and at last close the scene by
virtue of his own importance.</P>
<P>Almost all the heroes of this kind, who
have hitherto succeeded on the English
stage, are characters of transcendent worth,
conducted through the vicissitudes of fortune,
to that goal of happiness, which ever ought
to be the repose of extraordinary desert.—Yet
the same principle by which we rejoice
at the remuneration of merit, will teach us to
<PB N="vi" REF="7"/>
relish the disgrace and discomfiture of vice,
which is always an example of extensive
use and in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>luence, because it leaves a deep
impression of terror upon the minds of
those who were not confirmed in the pur∣suit
of morality and virtue, and while the
balance wavers, enables the right scale to
preponderate.</P>
<P>In the Drama, which is a more limited
field of invention, the chief personage is
often the object of our detestation and ab∣horrence;
and we are as well pleased to see
the wicked schemes of a RICHARD blasted,
and the perfidy of a MASKWELL exposed,
as to behold a BEVIL happy, and an ED∣WARD
victorious.</P>
<P>The impulses of fear which is the most
violent and interesting of all the passions,
remain longer than any other upon the
memory; and for one that is allured to vir∣tue,
by the contemplation of that peace and
happiness which it bestows, an hundred
are deterred from the practice of vice, by
that infamy and punishment to which it is
liable, from the laws and regulations of
mankind.</P>
<P>Let me not therefore be condemned for
having chosen my principal character from
the purlieus of treachery and fraud, when
<PB N="vii" REF="8"/>
I declare my purpose is to set him up as a
beacon for the benefit of the unexperienced
and unwary, who from the perusal of these
memoirs, may learn to avoid the manifold
snares with which they are continually sur∣rounded
in the paths of life; while those
who hesitate on the brink of iniquity, may
be terrified from plunging into that irreme∣able
gulph, by surveying the deplorable
fate of FERDINAND Count FATHOM.</P>
<P>That the mind might not be fatigued,
nor the imagination disgusted by a succes∣sion
of vitious objects, I have endeavoured
to refresh the attention with occasional inci∣dents
of a different nature; and raised up a
virtuous character, in opposition to the ad∣venturer,
with a view to amuse the fancy,
engage the affection, and form a striking
contrast which might heighten the expres∣sion,
and give a <HI>Relief</HI> to the moral of
the whole.</P>
<P>If I have not succeeded in my endeavours
to unfold the mysteries of fraud, to instruct
the ignorant, and entertain the vacant; if I
have failed in my attempts to subject folly
to ridicule, and vice to indignation; to
rouse the spirit of mirth, wake the soul of
compassion, and touch the secret springs
that move the heart; I have at least, adorn∣ed
virtue with honour and applause;
<PB N="viii" REF="9"/>
branded iniquity with reproach and shame,
and carefully avoided every hint or expres∣sion
which could give umbrage to the most
delicate reader: circumstances which (what∣ever
may be my fate with the public) will
with you always operate in favour of</P>

<HEAD>THE
ADVENTURES
OF
Ferdinand Count Fathom.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Some sage observations that naturally introduce
our important history.</HEAD>
<P>CARDINAL de Retz very judiciously
observes, that all historians must of ne∣cessity,
be subject to mistakes, in explain∣ing
the motives of those actions they record, un∣less
they derive their intelligence from the can∣did
confession of the person whose character they
represent; and that, of consequence, every man
of importance ought to write his own memoirs,
provided he has honesty enough to tell the truth,
without suppressing any circumstance, that may
tend to the information of the reader. This,
however, is a requisite that, I am afraid, would
<PB N="2" REF="11"/>
be very rarely found among the number of those
who exhibit their own portraits to the public:
indeed, I will venture to say, that how upright
soever a man's intentions may be, he will, in the
performance of such a task, be sometimes misled
by his own phantasy, and represent objects, as
they appeared to him, through the mists of pre∣judice
and passion.</P>
<P>An unconcerned reader, when he peruses the
history of two competitors, who lived two thou∣sand
years ago, or who, perhaps, never had ex∣istence,
except in the imagination of the author,
cannot help interesting himself in the dispute,
and espousing one side of the contest, with all
the zeal of a warm adherent. What wonder
then, that we should be heated in our own concerns,
review our actions with the same self-approba∣tion
that they had formerly acquired, and re∣commend
them to the world with all the en∣thusiasm
of paternal affection?</P>
<P>Supposing this to be the case, it was lucky for
the cause of historical truth, that so many pens
have been drawn by writers, who could not
be suspected of such partiality; and that many
great personages, among the ancients as well as
moderns, either would not, or could not enter∣tain
the public with their own memoirs. From
this want of inclination or capacity to write, in
our hero himself, the undertaking is now left
to me, of transmitting to posterity, the remark∣able
adventures of FERDINAND Count FATHOM;
and by that time the reader shall have glanced
over the subsequent sheets, I doubt not, but he
will bless God, that the adventurer was not his
own historian.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="12"/>
This mirrour of modern chivalry was none
of those who owe their dignity to the circum∣stances
of their birth, and are consecrated from
the cradle for the purposes of greatness, meerly
because they are the accidental children of
wealth. He was heir to no visible patrimony,
unless we reckon a robust constitution, a tolera∣ble
appearance, and an uncommon capacity, as
the advantages of inheritance: if the comparison
obtains in this point of consideration, he was as
much as any man, indebted to his parents; and
pity it was, that in the sequel of his fortune, he
never had an opportunity of manifesting his
filial gratitude and regard. From this agreeable
act of duty to his sire, and all those tender∣nesses
that are reciprocally enjoyed betwixt the
father and the son, he was unhappily excluded
by a small circumstance; at which, however, he
was never heard to repine. In short, had he
been brought forth in the fabulous ages of the
world, the nature of his origin might have turn∣ed
to his account; he might, like other heroes
of antiquity, have laid claim to divine extrac∣tion,
without running the risque of being claim∣ed
by any earthly father; not that his parents
had any reason to disown or renounce their off∣spring,
or that there was any thing preternatural
in the circumstances of his generation and birth; on
the contrary, he was from the beginning, a child
of promising parts, and in due course of nature,
ushered into the world, amidst a whole cloud of
witnesses: but, that he was acknowledged by no
mortal sire, solely proceeded from the uncertainty
of his mother, whose affections were so dissipated
among a number of admirers, that she could
<PB N="4" REF="13"/>
never pitch upon the person from whose loins
our hero sprung.</P>
<P>Over and above this important doubt, under
which he was begotten, other particularities at∣tended
his birth, and seemed to mark him out
as something uncommon among the sons of men.
He was brought forth in a waggon, and might
be said to be literally a native of two different
countries; for, though he first saw the light in
Holland, he was not born till after the carriage
arrived in Flanders; so that all these extraor∣dinary
circumstances considered, the task of de∣termining
to what government he naturally
owed allegiance, would be at least as difficult,
as that of ascertaining the so much contested
birth-place of Homer.</P>
<P>Certain it is, the count's mother was an Eng∣lishwoman,
who, after having been five times
a widow in one campaign, was, in the last year
of the renowned Marlborough's command, num∣bered
among the baggage of the allied army,
which she still accompanied, through pure bene∣volence
of spirit, supplying the ranks with the
refreshing streams of choice geneva, and ac∣commodating
individuals with clean linnen, as
the emergency of their occasions required: Nor
was her philanthropy altogether confined to such
ministration: she abounded with “the milk
of human kindness,” which flowed plenti∣fully
among her fellow-creatures; and to every
son of Mars who cultivated her favour, she libe∣rally
dispensed her smiles, in order to sweeten
the toils and dangers of the field.</P>
<P>And here it will not be amiss to anticipate the
remarks of the reader, who, in the chastity and
excellency of his conception, may possibly ex∣claim,
<PB N="5" REF="14"/>
“Good Heaven! will these authors never
reform their imaginations, and list their ideas
from the obscene objects of low life? Must
the publick be again disgusted with the grovel∣ing
adventures of a waggon? Will no writer
of genius draw his pen in the vindication of
taste, and entertain us with the agreeable cha∣racters,
the dignified conversation, the poignant
repartee, in short, the genteel comedy of the
polite world?”</P>
<P>Have a little patience, gentle, delicate, sub∣lime,
critic; you, I doubt not, are one of those
consummate connoisseurs, who in their purifica∣tions,
let humour evaporate, while they endea∣vour
to preserve decorum, and polish wit, until
the edge of it is quite wore off: or, perhaps of
that class, who, in the sapience of taste, are
disgusted with those very flavours, in the produc∣tions
of their own country, which have yielded
infinite delectation to their faculties, when im∣ported
from another clime; and damn an author
in despite of all precedent and prescription;
who extol the writings of Petronius Arbiter,
read with rapture the amorous fallies of Ovid's
pen, and chuckle over the story of Lucian's
ass; yet, if a modern author presumes to relate
the progress of a simple intrigue, are shocked at
the indecency and immorality of the scene: who
delight in following Guzman d'Alfarache, thro'
all the mazes of squalid beggary; who with
pleasure accompany Don Quixote and his squire,
in the lowest paths of fortune; who are diverted
with the adventures of Scarron's ragged troop
of strollers, and highly entertained with the ser∣vile
situations of Gil Blas; yet, when a cha∣racter
in humble life occasionally occurs in a
<PB N="6" REF="15"/>
performance of our own growth, exclaim with
an air of disgust, “Was ever any thing so
mean! Sure, this writer must have been very
conversant with the lowest scenes of life:” who,
when Swift or Pope represents a coxcomb in
the act of swearing, scruple not to laugh at the
ridiculous execrations; but in a less reputed au∣thor,
condemn the use of such profane ex∣pletives:
who eagerly explore the jakes of Ra∣be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ais,
for amusement, and even extract hu∣mour
from the dean's description of a lady's
dressing-room: yet, in a production of these
days, unstampt with such venerable names, will
stop their noses with all the signs of loathing and
abhorrence, at a bare mention of the china cham∣ber-pot:
who applaud Catullus, Juvenal, Per∣sius
and Lucan, for their spirit in lashing the
greatest names of antiquity; yet, when a British
fatirist, of this generation, has courage enough
to call in question the talents of a Pseudo-pa∣tron,
in power, accuse him of insolence, ran∣cour
and scurrility.</P>
<P>If such you be, courteous reader, I say again,
have a little patience; for your entertainment we
are about to write. Our hero shall, with all
convenient dispatch, be gradually sublimed, into
those splendid connexions of which you are ena∣moured;
and God forbid, that in the mean
time, the nature of his extraction should turn
to his prejudice, in a land of freedom like this,
where individuals are every day ennobled in
consequence of their own qualifications, with∣out
the least retrospective regard to the rank or
merit of their ancestors. Yes, refined reader,
we are hastening to that goal of perfection,
<PB N="7" REF="16"/>
where satire dares not shew her face; where na∣ture
is castligated, almost even to still life; where
humour turns changeling, and slavers in an in∣sipid
grin; where wit is volatilized into a meer
vapour; where decency, divested of all sub∣stance,
hovers about like a fantastic shadow;
where the salt of genius, escaping, leaves no∣thing
but pure and simple phlegm; and the in∣offensive
pen for ever drops the mild manna of
soul-sweetning praise.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A superficial view of our hero's infancy.</HEAD>
<P>HAving thus bespoke the indulgence of our
guests, let us now produce the particulars
of our entertainment, and speedily conduct our
adventurer through the stage of infancy, which
seldom teems with interesting incidents.</P>
<P>As the occupations of his mother would not
conveniently permit her to suckle this her first-born
at her own breast, and those happy ages
were now no more, in which the charge of
nursing a child might be lest to the next goat
or she-wolf, she resolved to improve upon the
ordinances of nature, and foster him with a
juice much more ene<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gic than the milk of goat,
or wolf, or woman; this was no other than that
delicious nectar, which, as we have already
hinted, she so cordially distributed from a small
cask that hung before her, depending from her
shoulders by a leathern zone. Thus determined,
'ere he was yet twelve days old, she enclosed
him in a canvas knapsack, which being adjusted
<PB N="8" REF="17"/>
to her neck, sell down upon her back, and bal∣lanced
the cargo that rested on her bosom.</P>
<P>There are not wanting those who affirm,
that while her double charge was carried about
in this situation, her cag was furnished with a
long and slender flexible tube, which, when the
child began to be clamorous, she conveyed into
his mouth, and strait he stilled himself with suck∣ing;
but this we consider as an extravagant
assertion of those, who mix the marvellous in
all their narrations, because we cannot conceive
how the tender organs of an infant, could digest
such a fiery beverage, which never fails to dis∣compose
the constitutions of the most hardy and
robust: we therefore conclude, that the use of
this potation was more restrained, and that it
was with simple element, diluted into a compo∣sition
adapted to his taste and years. Be this
as it will, he certainly was indulged in the use of
it to such a degree, as would have effectually
obstructed his future fortune, had not he been
happily cloyed with the repetition of the same
fare, for which he conceived the utmost detes∣tation
and abhorrence, rejecting it with loath∣ing
and disgust, like those choice spirits, who,
having been crammed with religion in their
childhood, renounce it in their youth, among
other absurd prejudices of education.</P>
<P>While he thus dangled in a state of suspen∣sion,
a German trooper was transiently smit
with the charms of his mother, who listened to
his honourable addresses, and once more received
the silken bonds of matrimony; the ceremony
having been performed as usual at the drum-head.
The lady had no sooner taken possession of her new
name, than she bestowed it upon her son, who
<PB N="9" REF="18"/>
was thenceforward distinguished by the appella∣tion
of Ferdinand de Fadom; nor was the hus∣band
offended at this presumption in his wife,
which he not only considered as a proof of her
affection and esteem, but also as a compliment,
by which he might in time acquire the credit
of being the real father of such an hopeful
child.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this new engagement with
a foreigner, our Hero's mother still exercised the
virtues of her calling among the English troops,
so much was she blassed by that laudable par∣tiality,
which, as Horace observes, the <HI>natale
solum</HI> generally inspires: indeed this inclination
was enforced by another reason, that did not
fail to influence her conduct in this particular;
all her knowledge of the high Dutch language
consisted in some words of traffic, absolutely
necessary for the practice of her vocation; to∣gether
with sundry oaths and terms of reproach,
that kept her customers in awe; so that, except
among her own countrymen, she could not in∣dulge
that propensity to conversation, for which
she had been remarkable from her earliest years.
Nor did this instance of her affection fail of
turning to her account in the sequel: She was
promoted to the office of cook to a regimental
mess of officers; and before the peace of Utrecht,
was actually in possession of a suttling-tent,
pitched for the accommodation of the gentle∣men
in the army.</P>
<P>Mean while, Ferdinand improved apace in
the accomplishments of infancy; his beauty was
conspicuous, and his vigour so uncommon, that
he was with justice likened unto Hercules in the
cradle: the friends of his father-in-law, dandled
<PB N="10" REF="19"/>
him on their knees, while he played with their
whiskers, and before he was thirteen months old,
taught him to suck brandy impregnated with
gun-powder, through the touch-hole of a pistol.
At the same time, he was caressed by divers ser∣jeants
of the British army, who severally and
in secret contemplated his qualifications with a
father's pride, excited by the artful declara∣tion,
with which the mother had flattered each
apart.</P>
<P>Soon as the war was (for her unhappily) con∣cluded,
she, as in duty bound, followed her hus∣band
into Bohemia; and his regiment being sent
into garrison at Prague, she opened a cabaret
in that city, which was frequented by a good
many guests of the Scotch and Irish nations,
who were devoted to the exercise of arms, in
the service of the emperor. It was by this
communication, that the English tongue became
vernacular to young Ferdinand, who, without
such opportunity, would have been a stranger to
the language of his forefathers, in spite of all
his mother's loquacity and elocution: though it
must be owned, for the credit of her maternal
care, that she let slip no occasion of making it
familiar to his ear and conception; for, even at
those intervals in which she could find no per∣son
to carry on the altercation, she used to hold
forth in earnest soliloquies upon the subject of
her own situation, giving vent to many oppro∣brious
invectives against her husband's country,
between which and old England she drew many
odious comparisons; and prayed without ceasing
that Europe might speedily be involved in a ge∣neral
war, so as that she might have some chance
<PB N="11" REF="20"/>
of reinjoying the pleasures and emoluments of a
Flanders compaign.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He is initiated in a military life, and has the
good fortune to acquire a generous patron.</HEAD>
<P>WHile she wearied Heaven with these peti∣tions,
the flame of war broke out be∣twixt
the houses of Ottoman and Austria, and
the emperor sent forth an army into Hungary,
under the auspices of the renowned prince Eu∣gene.
On account of this expedition, the mother
of our hero gave up house-keeping, and chear∣fully
followed her customers and husband into
the field; having first provided herself with store
of those commodities, in which she had for∣merly
merchandized. Although the hope of pro∣fit
might in some measure affect her determina∣tion,
one of the chief motives for her visiting
the frontiers of Turkey, was the desire of ini∣tiating
her son in the rudiments of his education,
which she now thought high time to inculcate,
he being, at this period, in the sixth year of his
age; he was ac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ordingly conducted to the camp,
which she considered as the most consummate
school of life, and proposed for the scene of his
instruction; and in this academy he had not
continued many weeks, when he was an eye∣witness
of that famous victory, which, with
sixty thousand men, the imperial general ob∣tained
over an army of one hundred and fifty
thousand Turks.</P>
<P>His father in law was engaged, and his mo∣ther
would not be idle on this occasion: she
<PB N="12" REF="21"/>
was a perfect mistress of all the camp qualifica∣tions,
and thought it a duty incumbent on her,
to contribute all that lay in her power, towards
distressing the enemy: with these sentiments,
she hovered about the skirts of the army, and
the troops were no sooner employed in the pur∣suit,
than she began to traverse the field of bat∣tle
with a poignard and a bag, in order to
consult her own interest, annoy the foe, and
exercise her humanity at the same time. In
short, she had with amazing prowess, delivered
some fifty or threescore disabled mu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fulmen of
the pain under which they groaned, and made
a comfortable booty of the spoils of the slain,
when her eyes were attracted by the rich attire
of an imperial officer, who lay bleeding on
the plain, to all appearance in the agonies of
death.</P>
<P>She could not, in her heart, refuse that favour
to a friend and christian, she had so compassion∣ately
bestowed upon so many enemies and infi∣dels,
and therefore drew near with the sovereign
remedy, which she had already administred with
such success. As she approached this deplorable
object of pity, her ears were surprized with an
ejaculation in the English tongue, which he fer∣vently
pronounced, though with a weak and
languid voice, recommending his soul to God,
and his family to the protection of Heaven.
Our amazon's purpose was staggered by this pro∣vidential
incident; the sound of her native lan∣guage,
so unexpectedly heard, and so patheti∣cally
delivered, had a surprising effect upon her
imagination; and the faculty of reflexion did
not forsake her in such emergency: though she
could not recollect the features of this unhappy
<PB N="13" REF="22"/>
officer, she concluded from his appearance, that
he was some person of distinction in the service,
and foresaw greater advantage to herself in at∣tempting
to preserve his life, than she could possi∣bly
reap from the execution of her first resolve.
“If (said she to herself) I can find means of
conveying him to his tent, alive, he cannot but
in conscience acknowledge my humanity with
some considerable recompence; and should he
chance to survive his wounds, I have every
thing to expect from his gratitude and power.”</P>
<P>Fraught with these prudential suggestions, she
drew near the unfortunate stranger, and in a
softened accent of pity and condolance, question∣ed
him concerning his name, condition, and the
nature of his mischance, at the same time mak∣ing
a gentle tender of her service. Agreeably
surprized to hear himself accosted in such a man∣ner,
by a person whose equipage seemed to
promise far other designs, he thanked her in the
most grateful terms for her humanity, with the
appellation of kind countrywoman; gave her to
understand that he was colonel of a regiment of
horse; that he had fallen in consequence of a
shot he received in his breast, at the beginning
of the action; and finally intreated her to pro∣cure
some carriage on which he might be re∣moved
to his tent. Perceiving him faint and
exhausted with loss of blood, she raised up his
head, and treated him with that cordial which
was her constant companion: at that instant,
espying a small body of hussars returning to the
camp with the plunder they had taken, she in∣voked
their assistance, and they forthwith carried
the officer to his own quarters, where his wound
<PB N="14" REF="23"/>
was dressed, and his preserver carefully tended
him until his recovery was compleated.</P>
<P>In return for these good offices, this gentle∣man,
who was originally of Scotland, rewarded
her for the present, with great liberality, assured
her of his influence in promoting her husband,
and took upon himself the charge of young
Ferdinand's education; the boy was immediately
taken into his protection, and entered as a
trooper in his own regiment; but his good in∣tentions
towards his father-in-law, were frustrat∣ed
by the death of the German, who in a few
days after this disposition, was shot in the
trenches before Temiswaer.</P>
<P>This event, over and above the conjugal af∣fliction
with which it invaded the lady's quiet,
would have involved her in infinite difficulty and
distress, with regard to her temporal concerns,
by leaving her unprotected in the midst of
strangers, had not she been thus providentially
supplied, with an effectual patron in the colonel,
who was known by the appellation of count
Melvil. He no sooner saw her, by the death of
her husband, detached from all personal con∣nexions
with a military life, than he proposed
that she should quit her occupation in the camp,
and retire to his habitation in the city of Pres∣burg,
where she would be entertained in case
and plenty, during the remaining part of her
natural life: with all due acknowledgments of
his generosity, she begged to be excused from
embracing his proposal, alledging she was so
much accustomed to her present way of life,
and so much devoted to the service of the sol∣diery,
that she should never be happy in retire∣ment,
<PB N="15" REF="24"/>
while the troops of any prince of Chris∣tendom
kept the field.</P>
<P>The count finding her determined to prose∣cute
her scheme, repeated his promise of be∣friending
her upon all occasions; and in the mean
time, admitted Ferdinand into the number of
his domestics, resolving that he should be brought
up in attendance upon his own son, who was a
boy of the same age. He kept him, however,
in his tent, until he should have an opportunity
of revisiting his family in person; and before
that occasion offered, two whole years elapsed,
during which, the illustrious prince Eugene
gained the celebrated battle of Belgrade, and af∣terwards
made himself master of that important
frontier.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">His mother's prowess and death; together with some
instances of his own sagacity.</HEAD>
<P>IT would have been impossible for the mother
of our adventurer, such as she hath been de∣scribed,
to sit quietly in her tent, while such an
heroic scene was acting. She was no sooner ap∣prised
of the general's intention to attack the
enemy, than she, as usual, packed up her move∣ables
in a waggon, which she committed to the
care of a peasant in the neighbourhood, and put
herself in motion with the troops; big with the
expectation of re-acting that part, in which she
had formerly acquitted herself so much to her
advantage. Nay, she by this time looked upon
her own presence as a certain omen of success
to the cause which she espoused; and in their
<PB N="16" REF="25"/>
march to battle, actually encouraged the ranks
with repeated declarations, importing, that she
had been eye-witness of ten decisive engage∣ments,
in all of which her friends had been vic∣torious,
and imputing such uncommon good
fortune to some supernatural quality inherent
in her person.</P>
<P>Whether or not this confidence contributed
to the fortune of the day, by inspiriting the sol∣diers
to an uncommon pitch of courage and re∣solution,
I shall not pretend to determine: but,
certain it is, the victory began from that
quarter in which she had posted herself; and
no corps in the army behaved with such intre∣pidity
as that, which was manifested by those
who were favoured with her admonitions and
example; for, she not only exposed her person
to the enemy's fire, with the indifference and
deliberation of a veteran, but she is said to
have atchieved a very conspicuous exploit by
the prowess of her single arm: the extremity
of the line to which she had attached herself,
being assaulted in flank by a body of the spahis,
wheeled about, in order to sustain the charge,
and received them with such a seasonable fire,
as brought a great number of turbans to the
ground; among those who fell, was one of the
chiefs, or aga's, who had advanced before the
rest, with a view to signalize his valour.</P>
<P>Our English Penthesilea no sooner saw this
Turkish leader drop, than, struck with the mag∣nificence
of his own and horse's trappings, she
sprung forward to seize them as her prize, and
found the aga not dead, though in a good mea∣sure
disabled by his misfortune, which was in∣tirely
owing to the weight of his horse, that,
<PB N="17" REF="26"/>
having been killed by a musket-ball, lay upon
his leg, so that he could not disingage himself.
Nevertheless, perceiving the virago approach
with fell intent, he brandished his scymitar, and
tried to intimidate his assailant with a most hor∣rible
exclamation; but, it was not the dismal yell
of a dismounted cavalier, though enforced with
a hideous ferocity of countenance, and the me∣nacing
gestures with which he waited her ap∣proach,
that could intimidate such an undaunted
she-campaigner; she saw him writhing in the
agonies of a situation from which he could not
move; and, running towards him with the nim∣bleness
and intrepidity of a Camilla, described
a semicircle in the progress of her assault, and
attacking him on one side, plunged her well-tried
dagger in his throat: the shades of death
encompassed him, his life-blood issued at the
wound, he fell prone upon the earth, he bit
the dust, and having thrice invoked the name
of Allah! straight expired.</P>
<P>While his destiny was thus fulfilled, his follow∣ers
began to reel; they seemed dismayed at the
fate of their chief, beheld their companions drop
like the leaves in autumn, and suddenly halted in
the midst of their career. The Imperialists observ∣ing
the confusion of the enemy, redoubled their
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire; and raising a dreadful shout, advanced in
order to improve the advantage they had gained:
the spahis durst not wait the shock of such an
encounter; they wheeled to the right about, and
clapping spurs to their horses, fled in the utmost
disorder. This was actually the circumstance
that turned the scale of battle: the Austrians
pursued their good fortune with uncommon im∣petuosity,
and in a few minutes, left the field
<PB N="18" REF="27"/>
clear for the mother of our hero, who was such
an adept in the art of stripping, that in the
twinkling of an eye, the bodies of the aga and
his Arabian, lay naked to the skin. It would
have been happy for her, had she been content∣ed
with these first-fruits, reaped from the for∣tune
of the day, and retired with her spoils,
which were not inconsiderable; but, intoxicated
with the glory she had won, inticed by the glit∣tering
caparisons that lay scattered on the plain,
and without doubt, prompted by the secret in∣stinct
of her fate, she resolved to seize oppor∣tunity
by the forelock, and once for all indem∣nify
herself for the many fatigues, hazards and
sorrows she had undergone.</P>
<P>Thus determined, she reconnoitred the field,
and practised her address so successfully, that in
less than half an hour, she was loaded with er∣min
and embroidery, and disposed to retreat with
her burden, when her regards were sollicited by
a splendid bundle, which she descried at some
distance lying on the ground. This was no
other than an unhappy officer of hussars; who,
after having had the good fortune to take a
Turkish standard, was desperately wounded in
the thigh, and obliged to quit his horse; finding
himself in such an helpless condition, he had
wrapped his acquisition round his body, that
whatever might happen, he and his glory should
not be parted; and thus shrouded among the
dying and the dead, he had observed the progress
of our heroine, who stalked about the field,
like another Atropos, finishing, wherever she
came, the work of death: he did not at all
doubt, that he himself would be visited in the
course of her peregrinations, and therefore pro∣vided
<PB N="19" REF="28"/>
for her reception, with a pistol ready cock'd
in his hand, while he lay perdue, beneath his
covert, in all appearance bereft of life. He
was not deceived in his prognostic; she no sooner
eyed the golden crescent, than inflamed with
curiosity or cupidity, she directed thitherward
her steps, and discerning the carcase of a man,
from which, she thought, there would be a ne∣cessity
for disengaging it, she lifted up her weapon,
in order to make sure of her purchase; and in
the very instant of discharging her blow, receiv'd
a brace of bullets in her brain.</P>
<P>Thus ended the mortal pilgrimage of this
modern amazon; who, in point of courage, was
not inferior to Semiramis, Tomyris, Zenobia,
Thale<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ris, or any boasted heroine of antient
times. It cannot be supposed, that this cata∣strophe
made a very deep impression upon the
mind of young Ferdinand, who had just then
attained the ninth year of his age, and been for
a considerable time, weaned from her maternal
caresses; especially, as he felt no wants nor
grievances in the family of the count, who fa∣voured
him with a particular share of indulgence,
because he perceived in him, a spirit of docility,
insinuation, and sagacity, far above his years.
He did not, however, fail to lament the untime∣ly
fate of his mother, with such filial expressions
of sorrow, as still more intimately recommended
him to his patron; who being, himself, a
man of extraordinary benevolence, looked upon
the boy as a prodigy of natural affection, and
foresaw in his future services a fund of gratitude
and attachment, that could not fail to render
him a valuable acquisition to his family.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="29"/>
In his own country he had often seen connec∣tions
of that sort, which having been planted in
the infancy of the adherent, had grown up to
a surprising pitch of fidelity and friendship,
that no temptation could biass, and no danger
dissolve. He therefore rejoiced in the hope of
seeing his own son accommodated with such a
faithful attendant, in the person of young Fa∣thom,
on whom he resolved to bestow the same
education he had planned for the other, though
conveyed in such a manner as should be suitable
to the sphere in which he was ordained to move.
In consequence of these determinations, our
young adventurer led a very easy life, in quality
of page to the count, in whose tent he lay up∣on
a pallet, close to his field-bed, and often di∣verted
him with his childish prattle in the English
tongue, which the more seldom his master had
occasion to speak, he the more delighted to hear.
In the exercise of his function, the boy was in∣credibly
affiduous and alert; far from neglecting
the little particulars of his duty, and embark∣ing
in the mischievous amusements of the chil∣dren
belonging to the camp, he was always di∣ligent,
sedate, agreeably officious and anticipat∣ing;
and in the whole of his behaviour, seemed
to express the most vigilant sense of his patron's
goodness and generosity: nay, to such a degree
had these sentiments, in all appearance, operated
upon his reflexion, that one morning while he
supposed the count asleep, he crept softly to his
bedside, and gently kissing his hand, which hap∣pened
to be uncovered, pronounced, in a low
voice, a most fervent prayer in his behalf, be∣seeching
Heaven to shower down blessings upon
<PB N="21" REF="30"/>
him, as the widow's friend and the orphan's fa∣ther:
this benediction was not lost upon the
count, who chanced to be awake and heard it
with admiration; but, what rivetted Ferdinand
in his good graces, was a discovery that our
youth made, while his master was upon duty in
the trenches before Belgrade.</P>
<P>Two foot-soldiers standing centry near the
door of the tent, were captivated with the sight
of some valuable moveables belonging to it; and
supposing, in their great wisdom, that the city of
Belgrade was too well fortified to be taken dur∣ing
that campaign, they came to a resolution
of with-drawing themselves from the severe
service of the trenches, by deserting to the ene∣my,
after they should have rifled count Melvil's
tent, of the furniture by which they were so
powerfully allured: the particulars of this plan
were concerted in the French language, which,
they imagined, would screen them from all risk
of being detected, in case they should be over∣heard,
though, as there was no living creature in
sight, they had no reason to believe, that any
person was privy to their conversation. Never∣theless,
they were mistaken in both these con∣jectures.
The conference reached the ears of
Fathom, who was at the other end of the tent,
and had perceived the eager looks, with which
they considered some parts of the furniture: he
had penetration enough to suspect their desire,
and alarmed by that suspicion, listened atten∣tively
to their discourse, which from a slender
knowledge in the French tongue, he had the
good fortune partly to understand.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="31"/>
This important piece of intelligence he com∣municated
to the count at his return, and mea∣sures
were immediately taken to defeat the de∣sign,
and make an example of the authors, who
being permitted to load themselves with the
booty, were apprehended in their retreat, and
punished with death according to their demerits.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A brief detail of his education.</HEAD>
<P>NOthing could have more seasonably happen∣ed,
to confirm the good opinion which
the colonel entertained of Ferdinand's principles:
his intentions towards the boy grew every day
more and more warm; and immediately after
the peace of Passarowitz, he retired to his own
house at Presburg, and presented young Fathom
to his lady, not only as the son of a person to
whom he owed his life, but also as a lad, who
merited his peculiar protection and regard by his
own personal virtue. The countess, who was an
Hungarian, received him with great kindness
and affability, and her son was ravished with
the prospect of enjoying such a companion: in
short, fortune seemed to have provided for him
an asylum, in which he might be safely trained
up, and suitably prepared for more important
scenes of life, than any of his ancestors had ever
known.</P>
<P>He was not, in all respects, entertained on the
footing of his young master; yet he shar'd in all his
education and amusements, as one whom the old
gentleman was fully determined to qualify for the
station of an officer in the service; and if he
<PB N="23" REF="32"/>
did not eat with the count, he was every day
regaled with choice bits from his table; holding,
as it were, a middle place between the rank of
a relation; and favoured domestic. Although
his patron maintained a tutor in the house, to
superintend the conduct of his heir, he com∣mitted
the charge of his learning to the instruc∣tions
of a public school; where, he imagined,
the boy would imbibe a laudable spirit of emula∣tion
among his fellows, which could not fail of
turning out to the advantage of his education.
Ferdinand was entered in the same academy;
and the two lads proceeded equally in the paths
of erudition; a mutual friendship and intimacy
soon ensued, and notwithstanding the levity and
caprice commonly discernible in the behaviour
of such boys, very few, or rather no quarrels
happened in the course of their communication.
Yet their dispositions were altogether different,
and their talents unlike. Nay, this dissimila∣rity
was the very bond of their union; because
it prevented that jealousy and rivalship which of∣ten
interrupts the harmony of two warm co∣temporaries.</P>
<P>The young count made extraordinary pro∣gress
in the exercises of the school, though he
seemed to take very little pains in the cultiva∣tion
of his studies; and became a perfect hero in
all the athletic diversions of his fellow-scholars;
but, at the same time, exhibited such a bashful
appearance and uncouth address, that his mo∣ther
despaired of ever seeing him improved into
any degree of polite behaviour. On the other
hand, Fathom, who was in point of learning a
meer dunce, became, even in his childhood, re∣markable
among the ladies for his genteel de∣portment
<PB N="24" REF="33"/>
and vivacity; they admired the profi∣ciency
he made, under the directions of his dan∣cing-master,
the air with which he performed
his obeisance at his entrance and exit; and were
charmed with the agreeable assurance and lively
sallies of his conversation; while they express∣ed
the utmost concern and disgust at the boorish
demeanour of his companion, whose extorted
bows resembled the pawings of a mule, who
hung his head in silence, like a detected sheep-stealer,
who sat in company under the most auk∣ward
expressions of constraint, and whose dis∣course
never exceeded the simple monosyllable<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of negation and assent.</P>
<P>In vain did all the females of the family pro∣pose
to him young Fathom, as a pattern and re∣proach:
he remained unaltered by all their ef∣forts
and expostulations, and allowed our adven∣turer
to enjoy the triumph of his praise, while
he himself was conscious of his own superiority
in those qualifications which seemed of more
real importance than the meer exteriors and
forms of life. His present ambition was not to
make a figure at his father's table, but to
eclipse his rivals at school, and to acquire an
influence and authority among these confederates.
Nevertheless, Fathom might possibly have fallen
under his displeasure or contempt, had not that
pliant genius found means to retain his friend∣ship
by seasonable compliances and submission;
for, the sole study, or at least the chief aim of
Ferdinand, was to make himself necessary and
agreeable to those on whom his dependance
was placed: his talent was in this particular suit∣ed
to his inclination; he seemed to have inherit∣ed
it from his mother's womb; and without all
<PB N="25" REF="34"/>
doubt, would have raised upon it, a most ad∣mirable
superstructure of fortune and applause,
had not it been inseparably yoked with a most
insidious principle of self-love, that grew up
with him from the cradle, and left no room
in his heart for the least particle of social virtue.
This last, however, he knew so well how to
counterfeit, by means of a large share of ducti∣lity
and dissimulation, that, surely, he was cal∣culated
by nature, to dupe even the most cau∣tious,
and gratify his appetites by levying con∣tributions
on all mankind.</P>
<P>So little are the common instructors of youth,
qualified to judge the capacities of those who are
under their tutelage and care, that Fathom, by
dint of his insinuating arts, made shift to pass
upon the schoolmaster, as a lad of quick parts,
in despite of a natural inaptitude to retain his
lessons, which all his industry could never over∣come.
In order to remedy, or rather to cloak
this defect in his understanding, he had always
recourse to the friendship of the young count,
who freely permitted him to transcribe his exer∣cises,
until a small accident happened, which
had well-nigh put a stop to these instances of his
generosity.—The adventure, inconsiderable as
it is, we shall record, as the first overt-act of Fer∣dinand's
true character, as well as an illustration
of the opinion we have advanced, touching the
blind and injudicious decisions of a right peda∣gogue.</P>
<P>Among other tasks imposed by the pedant,
upon the form to which our two companions
belonged, they were one evening ordered to
translate a chapter of Caesar's commentaries.
Accordingly the young count went to work, and
<PB N="26" REF="35"/>
performed the undertaking with great elegance
and dispatch: Fathom having spent the night in
more effeminate amusements, was next morning
so much hurried for want of time, that in his
transcription, he neglected to insert a few varia∣tions
from the text; these being the terms on
which he was allowed to use it: so that it was
verbatim a copy of the original. As those exer∣cises
were always delivered in a heap, subscribed
with the several names of the boys to whom
they belonged; the schoolmaster chanced to pe∣ruse
the version of Ferdinand, before he looked
into any of the rest, and could not help bestow∣ing
upon it particular marks of approbation:
the next that fell under his examination was
that of the young count, when he immediately
perceived the sameness, and far from imputing
it to the true cause, upbraided him with hav∣ing
copied the exercise of our adventurer, and
insisted upon chastising him upon the spot, for
his want of application.</P>
<P>Had not the young gentleman thought his
honour was concerned, he would have submit∣ed
to the punishment without murmuring; but
he inherited from his parents the pride of two
fierce nations, and being overwhelmed with re∣proaches,
for that which he imagined, ought to
have redounded to his glory, he could not brook
the indignity, and boldly affirmed, that he him∣self
was the original, to whom Ferdinand was
beholden for his performance. The school∣master,
nettled to find himself mistaken in his
judgment, resolved that the count should have
no cause to exult in the discovery he had made,
and like a true flogger, actually whipt him for
having allowed Fathom to copy his exercise.
<PB N="27" REF="36"/>
Nay, in the hope of vindicating his own pene∣tration,
he took an opportunity of questioning
Ferdinand in private, concerning the circum∣stances
of the translation; and our hero perceiv∣ing
his drift, gave him such artful and ambiguous
answers, as persuaded him, that the young count
had acted the part of a plagiary, and that the
other had been restrained from doing himself
justice, by the consideration of his own dependance.</P>
<P>This profound director did not fail, in honour
of his own discernment, to whisper about the
misrepresentation, as an instance of the young
count's insolence, and Fathom's humility and
good sense. The story was circulated among
the servants, especially the maids belonging to the
family, whose favour our hero had acquired by his
engaging behaviour; and at length it reached the
ears of his patron, who incensed at his son's
presumption and inhospitality, called him to a
severe account, when the young gentleman
absolutely denied the truth of the allegation, and
appealed to the evidence of Fathom himself.
Our adventurer was accordingly summoned by
the father, and encouraged to declare the truth,
with an assurance of his constant protection;
upon which, Ferdinand very wisely fell upon his
knees, and while the tears gushed from his eyes,
acquitted the young count of the imputation,
and expressed his apprehension, that the report
had been spread by some of his enemies, who
wanted to prejudice him in the opinion of his
patron.</P>
<P>The old gentleman was not satisfied of his
son's integrity, by this declaration; being natu∣rally
of a generous disposition, highly prepossess∣ed
<PB N="28" REF="37"/>
in favour of the poor orphan, and chagrined
at the unpromising appearance of his heir, he
suspected that Fathom was over-awed by the fear
of giving offence, and that notwithstanding what
he had said, the case really stood as it had been
represented. In this persuasion, he earnestly
exhorted his son to resist and combat with any
impulse he might feel within himself, tending
to selfishness, fraud or imposition; to encourage
every sentiment of candour and benevolence, and
to behave with moderation and affability to all his
fellow-creatures. He laid upon him strong injunc∣tions,
not without a mixture of threats, to consi∣der
Fathom as the object of his peculiar regard;
to respect him as the son of the count's preser∣ver,
as a Briton, a stranger, and above all, an
helpless orphan, to whom the rights of hospita∣lity
were doubly due.</P>
<P>Such admonitions were not lost upon the
youth, who under the rough husk of his per∣sonal
exhibition, possessed a large share of ge∣nerous
sensibility: without any formal professions
to his father, he resolved to govern himself ac∣cording
to his remonstrances; and far from con∣ceiving
the least spark of animosity against Fa∣thom,
he looked upon the poor boy as the inno∣cent
cause of his disgrace, and redoubled his
kindness towards him, that his honour might
never again be called in question, upon the same
subject. Nothing is more liable to misconstruc∣tion
than an act of uncommon generosity; one
half of the world mistake the motive, from want
of ideas to conceive an instance of beneficence,
that soars so high above the level of their own
sentiments; and the rest suspect it of something
finister or selfish, from the suggestions of their
<PB N="29" REF="38"/>
own sordid and vicious inclinations. The young
count subjected himself to such misinterpreta∣tion,
among those who observed the increased
warmth of civility and complaisance in his beha∣viour
to Ferdinand: they ascribed it to his desire
of still profiting by our adventurer's superior ta∣lents,
by which alone they supposed him enabled
to maintain any degree of reputation at school;
or to the fear of being convicted by him of some
misdemeanour of which he knew himself guilty.
These suspicions were not effaced by the conduct
of Ferdinand, who, when examined on the sub∣ject,
managed his answers in such a manner, as
confirmed their conjectures, while he pretended
to refute them, and at the same time acquired to
himself credit for his extraordinary discretion and
self-denial.</P>
<P>If he exhibited such a proof of sagacity in the
twelfth year of his age, what might not be ex∣pected
from his finesse, in the maturity of his
faculties and experience? Thus secured in the
good graces of the whole family, he saw the
days of his puerility glide along in the most a∣greeable
elapse of caresses and amusement. He
never fairly plunged into the stream of school
education; but, by floating on the surface, im∣bibed
a small tincture of those different sciences,
which his master pretended to teach; in short,
he resembled those vagrant swallows that skim
along the level of some pool or river, without
venturing to wet one feather in their wings, ex∣cept
in the accidental pursuit of an inconsider∣able
fly. Yet, though his capacity or inclina∣tion
was unsuited for studies of this kind, he
did not fail to manifest a perfect genius in the
acquisition of other more profitable arts. Over
<PB N="30" REF="39"/>
and above the accomplishments of address, for
which he hath been already celebrated, he ex∣celled
all his fellows in his dexterity at sives and
billiards; was altogether unrivalled in his skill at
draughts and backgammon; began even at these
years, to understand the moves and schemes
of chess; and made himself a meer adept in the
mystery of cards, which he learned in the course
of his assiduities and attention to the females of
the house.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">He meditates schemes of importance.</HEAD>
<P>IT was in these parties, that he attracted the
notice and friendship of his patron's daugh∣ter,
a girl by two years older than himself, who
was not insensible to his qualifications, and look∣ed
upon him with the most favourable eyes of
prepossession. Whether or not he at this period
of his life, began to project plans for availing
himself of her susceptibility, is uncertain; but
without all doubt, he cultivated her esteem with
as obsequious and submissive attention, as if he
had already formed the design which in his ad∣vanced
age, he attempted to put in execu∣tion.</P>
<P>Divers circumstances conspired to promote
him in the favour of this young lady; the green∣ness
of his years, secured him from any suspi∣cion
of fallacious aim; so that he was indulged
in frequent opportunities of conversing with his
young mistress, whose parents encouraged this
communication, by which they hoped she would
improve in speaking the language of her father.
<PB N="31" REF="40"/>
Such connexions naturally produce intimacy and
friendship. Fathom's person was agreeable, his
talents calculated for the meridian of those par∣ties,
and his manners so engaging, that there
would have been no just subject for wonder,
had he made an impression upon the tender un∣experienced
heart of Mademoiselle de Melvil,
whose beauty was not so attractive as to extin∣guish
his hope, in raising up a number of formi∣dable
rivals; though her expectations of fortune
were such as commonly lend additional lustre to
personal merit.</P>
<P>All these considerations were so many steps to∣wards
the success of Ferdinand's pretensions;
and though he cannot be supposed to have per∣ceived
them at first, he in the sequel, seemed
perfectly well apprized of his advantages, and
used them to the full extent of his faculties. Ob∣serving
that she delighted in music, he betook
himself to the study of that art, and by dint of
application and a tolerable ear, learned of himself
to accompany her with a german flute, while
she sung and played upon the harpsichord. The
count seeing his inclination, and the progress he
had made, resolved that his capacity should not
be lost for want of cultivation; and accordingly
provided him with a master, by whom he was
instructed in the principles of the art, and soon
became a proficient in playing upon the violin.</P>
<P>In the practice of these improvements and
avocations, and in attendance upon his young
master, whom he took care never to disoblige or
neglect, he attained to the age of sixteen, with∣out
feeling the least abatement in the friendship
and generosity of those upon whom he depend∣ed;
but, on the contrary, receiving every day
<PB N="32" REF="41"/>
fresh marks of their bounty and regard. He had
before this time, been smit with the ambition of
making a conquest of the young lady's heart;
and foresaw manifold advantages to himself, in
becoming son in law to count Melvil, who, he
never doubted, would soon be reconciled to the
match, if once it could be effectuated without
his knowledge. Altho' he thought he had great
reason to believe that Mademoiselle looked upon
him with an eye of peculiar favour, his disposi∣tion
was happily tempered with an ingredient of
caution, that hindered him from acting with
precipitation, and he had discerned in the young
lady's deportment certain indications of loftiness
and pride, which kept him in the utmost vigi∣lance
of circumspection; for, he knew that by
a premature declaration, he should run the risque
of forfeiting all the advantages he had gained,
and blasting those expectations that now blossom∣ed
so gaily in his heart.</P>
<P>Restricted by these reflections, he acted at a
wary distance, and determined to proceed by
the method of sap, and summoning all his arti∣fice
and attractions to his aid, employed them un∣der
the in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idious cover of profound respect, in order
to undermine those bulwarks of haughtiness or dis∣cretion,
which, otherwise, might have rendered
his approaches to her impracticable. With a view
to inhance the value of his company, and sound
her sentiments at the same time, he became more
reserved than usual, and seldomer engaged in her
parties of music and cards; yet in the midst
of his reserve he never failed in those de∣monstrations
of reverence and regard, which he
knew perfectly well how to express; but devised
such excuses for his absence, as she could not
<PB N="33" REF="42"/>
help admitting. In consequence of this affected
shyness, she more than once, gently chid him
for his neglect and indifference, observing,
with an ironical air, that he was now too much
of a man to be entertained with such effeminate
diversions; but her reproofs were pronounced
with too much ease and good humour to be
agreeable to our hero, who desired to see her
ruffled and chagrined at his absence, and to hear
himself rebuked with an angry affectation of
disdain. This effort, therefore, he reinforced
with the most captivating carriage he could as∣sume,
in those hours which he now so sparingly
bestowed upon his mistress; he regaled her with
all the entertaining stories he could learn or in∣vent,
particularly such as he thought would jus∣tify
and recommend the levelling power of love,
that knows no distinctions of fortune. He sung
nothing but tender airs and passionate complaints,
composed by desponding or despairing swains;
and to render his performances of this kind the
more pathetic, interlarded them with some sea∣sonable
sighs, while the tears which he had ever
at command, stood collected in either eye.</P>
<P>It was impossible for her to overlook such stu∣died
emotions; she in a jocose manner, taxed
him with having lost his heart, rallied the excess
of his passion, and in a merry strain undertook
to be an advocate for his love. Her behaviour
was still wide of his wish and expectation: he
thought she would, in consequence of her disco∣very,
have betrayed some interested symptom;
that her face would have undergone some fa∣vourable
suffusion; that her tongue would have
faultered, her breast heaved, and her whole de∣portment
betokened internal agitation and dis∣order;
<PB N="34" REF="43"/>
in which case, he meant to profit by the
happy impression, and declare himself before she
could possibly recollect the dictates of her pride.
Baffled however in his endeavours, by the sere∣nity
of the young lady, which he still deemed
equivocal, he had recourse to another experi∣ment,
by which he believed, he should make a
discovery of her sentiments, beyond all possibi∣lity
of doubt. One day, while he accompanied
Mademoiselle in her exercises of music, he pre∣tended
all of a sudden, to be taken ill, and
counterfeited a swoon in her apartment. Sur∣prised
at this accident, she screamed aloud,
but far from running to his assistance, with the
transports and distraction of a lover, she ordered
her maid, who was present, to support his head,
and went in person to call for more help: he
was accordingly removed to his own chamber,
where, willing to be still more certified of her
inclinations, he prolonged the farce, and lay
groaning under the pretence of a severe fever.</P>
<P>The whole family was alarmed upon this oc∣casion;
for as we have already observed, he was
an universal favourite. He was immediately
visited by the old count and his lady, who ex∣pressed
the utmost concern at his distemper,
ordered him to be carefully attended, and sent
for a physician, without loss of time. The
young gentleman would scarce stir from his bed∣side,
where he ministred unto him with all the
demonstrations of brotherly affection; and miss
exhorted him to keep up his spirits, with many
expressions of unreserved sympathy and regard:
nevertheless, he saw nothing in her behaviour,
but what might be naturally expected from com∣mon
friendship, and a compassionate disposition,
<PB N="35" REF="44"/>
and was very much mortified at his disappoint∣ment.</P>
<P>Whether the miscarriage actually affected his
constitution, or the doctor happened to be mis∣taken
in his diagnostics, we shall not pretend to
determine; but the patient was certainly treated
Secundum Artem, and all his complaints in a little
time realized; for the physician, like a true gra∣duate,
had an eye to the apothecary, in his pre∣scriptions;
and such was the concern and scru∣pulous
care with which our hero was attended,
that the orders of the faculty were performed
with the utmost punctuality. He was blooded,
vomited, purged and blistered in the usual forms,
(for the physicians of Hungary are generally as
well skilled in the arts of their occupation, as
any other leeches under the sun) and swallowed
a whole dispensary of bolusses, draughts and apo∣zems,
by which means he became fairly deli∣rious
in three days, and so untractable, that he
could be no longer managed according to rule;
otherwise in all likelihood, the world would ne∣ver
have enjoyed the benefit of these adventures.
In short, his constitution, though unable to cope
with two such formidable antagonists, as the
doctor, and the disease he had conjured up, was
no sooner rid of the one, than it easily got the
better of the other, and though Ferdinand after
all, found his grand aim unaccomplished, his
malady was productive of a consequence, which
though he had not foreseen it, he did not fail to
convert to his own use and advantage.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Engages in partnership with a female associate, in
order to put his talents in action.</HEAD>
<P>WHile he displayed his qualifications in
order to intrap the heart of his young
mistress, he had unwittingly enslaved the affec∣tions
of her maid. This attendant was also a
favourite of the young lady, and though her
senior by two or three good years at least, un∣questionably
her superior in point of personal
beauty; she morever possessed a good stock
of cunning and discernment, and was furnished
by nature with a very amorous complexion.
These circumstances being premised, the reader
will not be surprised to find her smitten by those
uncommon qualifications which we have cele∣brated
in young Fathom. She had in good
sooth, long sighed in secret, under the power∣ful
influence of his charms, and practised upon
him all those little arts, by which a woman
strives to attract the admiration and ensnare the
heart of a man she loves; but, all his faculties
were employed upon the plan which he had al∣ready
projected; that was the goal of his whole
attention, to which all his measures tended; and
whether or not he perceived the impression he
had made upon Teresa, he never gave her the
least reason to believe he was conscious of his
victory, until he found himself baffled in his
design upon the heart of her mistress. She there∣fore
persevered in her distant attempts to allure
him, with the usual coquetries of dress and ad∣dress,
and in the sweet hope of profiting by his
<PB N="37" REF="46"/>
susceptibility, made shift to suppress her feelings,
and keep her passion within bounds; until his
supposed danger alarmed her fears, and raised
such a tumult within her breast, that she could
no longer conceal her love, but gave a loose to
her sorrow in the most immoderate expressions
of anguish and affliction, and while his delirium
lasted, behaved with all the agitation of a de∣spairing
shepherdess.</P>
<P>Ferdinand was, or pretended to be, the last
person in the family, who understood the situa∣tion
of her thoughts; when he perceived her
passion, he entered into deliberation with him∣self,
and tasked his reflexion and foresight, in
order to discover how best he might convert this
conquest to his own advantage. Here, then,
that we may neglect no opportunity of doing
justice to our hero, it will be proper to observe,
that howsoever unapt his understanding might be
to receive and retain the usual culture of the
schools, he was naturally a genius self-taught,
in point of sagacity and invention. He dived
into the characters of mankind, with a pene∣tration
peculiar to himself, and had he been ad∣mitted
as a pupil in any political academy, would
have certainly become one of the ablest statesmen
in Europe.</P>
<P>Having revolved all the probable consequences
of such a connexion, he determined to prosecute
an amour with the lady whose affection he had
subdued; because he hoped to interest her as an
auxiliary in his grand scheme upon Mademoiselle,
which he did not as yet think proper to lay
aside; for, he was not more ambitious in the
plan, than indefatigable in the prosecution of it.
He knew it would be impossible to execute his
<PB N="38" REF="47"/>
aims upon the count's daughter, under the eye
of Teresa, whose natural discernment would be
whetted with jealousy, and who would watch
his conduct, and thwart his progress with all the
vigilance and spite of a slighted maiden. On
the other hand, he did not doubt of being able
to bring her over to his interest, by the influence
he had already gained, or might afterwards ac∣quire
over her passions; in which case, she would
effectually espouse his cause, and employ her
good offices with her mistress, in his behalf:
besides, he was induced by another motive,
which though secondary, did not fail in this case
to have an effect upon his determination. He
looked upon Teresa with the eyes of appetite,
which he longed to gratify: for he was not at
all dead to the instigations of the flesh, though
he had philosophy enough to resist them, when
he thought they interfered with his interest. Here
the case was quite different: his desire happen∣ed
to be upon the side of his advantage, and
therefore, resolving to indulge it, he no sooner
found himself in a condition to manage such an
adventure, than he began to make gradual ad∣vances
in point of warmth and particular com∣placency
to the love-sick maid.</P>
<P>He first of all, thanked her in the most grate∣ful
terms, for the concern she had manifested at
his distemper, and the kind services he had re∣ceived
from her, during the course of it; he
treated her upon all occasions, with unusual
affability and regard, assiduously courted her ac∣quaintance
and conversation, and contracted an
intimacy that, in a little time, produced a de∣claration
of love. Although her heart was too
much intendered to hold out against all the forms
<PB N="39" REF="48"/>
of assault, far from yielding at discretion, she
stood upon honourable terms, with great obsti∣nacy
of punctilio, and while she owned he was
master of her inclinations, gave him to under∣stand
with a peremptory and resolute air, that
he should never make a conquest of her virtue:
observing, that if the passion he professed was
genuine, he would not scruple to give such a
proof of it, as would at once convince her
of his sincerity; and that he could have no
just cause to refuse her that satisfaction, she
being his equal in point of birth and situation:
for, if he was the companion and favourite of
the young count, she was the friend and confi∣dante
of Mademoiselle.</P>
<P>He acknowledged the strength of her argu∣ment,
and that her condescension was greater
than his dese<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts; but objected against the propo∣sal,
as infinitely prejudicial to the fortunes of them
both. He represented the state of dependance
in which they mutually stood; their utter in∣capacity
to support one another, under the con∣sequences
of a precipitate match, clandestinely
made, without the consent and concurrence of
their patrons: he displayed, with great eloquence,
all those gay expectations they had reason to
entertain, from that eminent degree of favour
which they had already secured in the family;
and set forth, in the most alluring colours, those
enchanting scenes of pleasures they might enjoy,
in each other, without that disagreeable consci∣ousness
of a nuptial chain, provided she would
be his associate in the execution of a plan,
which he had projected for their reciprocal con∣venience.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="49"/>
Having thus inflamed her love of pleasure and
curiosity, he, with great caution, hinted his de∣sign
upon the young lady's fortune, and per∣ceiving
her listening with the most greedy atten∣tion,
and perfectly ripe for the conspiracy, he
disclosed his intention at full length, assuring her,
with the most solemn protestations of love and
attachment, that could he once make himself
legal possessor of an estate which Mademoiselle
inherited, by the will of a deceased aunt, his
dear Teresa should reap the happy fruits of his
affluence; and wholly engross his time and at∣tention.</P>
<P>Such a base declaration our hero would not have
ventured to make, had he not implicitly believed
the damsel was as great a latitudinarian as him∣self
in point of morals and principle; and been
well assured that though he should be mistaken
in her way of thinking, so far as to be threat∣ned
with a detection of his purpose, he would
always have it in his power to refute her accusa∣tion
as meer calumny, by the character he had
hitherto maintained, and the circumspection of
his future conduct.</P>
<P>He seldom or never erred in his observations
on the human heart. Teresa, instead of dis∣approving,
relished the plan in general, with de∣monstrations
of singular satisfaction: she, at once
conceived all the advantageous consequences of
such a scheme, and perceived in it, only one
flaw, which, however, she did not think incurable.
This defect was no other than a sufficient bond
of union, by which they might be effectually
tied down to their mutual interest. She foresaw
that in case Ferdinand should obtain possession of
<PB N="41" REF="50"/>
the prize, he might, with great ease, deny their
contract, and disavow her claim of participation.
She therefore demanded security, and proposed
as a preliminary of the agreement, that he
should privately take her to wife, with a view
to dispel all her apprehensions of his inconstancy
or deceit, as such a previous engagement would
be a check upon his behaviour, and keep him
strictly to the letter of their contract.</P>
<P>He could not help subscribing to the righteous∣ness
of this proposal, which, nevertheless, he
would have willingly waved, on the supposition
that they could not possibly be joined in the
bands of wedlock, with such secrecy as the
nature of the case absolutely required. This
would have been a difficulty soon removed, had
the scene of the transaction been laid in the
metropolis of England, where passengers are
plied in the streets by clergymen, who prostitute
their characters and consciences for hire, in de∣fiance
of all decency and law; but in the king∣dom
of Hungary, ecclesiastics are more scru∣pulous
in the exercise of their function, and the
objection was, or supposed to be altogether in∣surmountable;
so that they were fain to have
recourse to an expedient, with which, after some
hesitation, our she-adventurer was satisfied. They
joined hands in the sight of Heaven, which they
called to witness, and to judge the sincerity of
their vows, and engaged in a voluntary oath to
confirm their union by the sanction of the
church, whenever a convenient opportunity for
so doing, should occur.</P>
<P>The scruples of Teresa being thus removed,
she admitted Ferdinand to the privileges of a
<PB N="42" REF="51"/>
husband, which he enjoyed in stolen interviews;
and readily undertook to exert her whole power
in promoting his suit with her young mistress,
because she now considered his interest as inse∣parably
connected with her own. Surely no∣thing
could be more absurd or preposterous,
than the articles of this covenant, which she in∣sisted
upon with such inflexibility. How could she
suppose, that her pretended lover would be restrain∣ed
by an oath, when the very occasion of incur∣ing
it, was an intention to act in violation of all
laws human and divine; and yet such ridiculous
conjuration is commonly the cement of every con∣spiracy,
how dark, how treacherous, how im∣pious
soever it may be. A certain sign that there
are some remains of religion left in the human
mind, even after every moral sentiment hath
abandoned it; and that the most execrable ruf∣fian
finds means to quiet the suggestions of his
conscience, by some reversionary hope of hea∣ven's
forgiveness.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Their first attempt; with a digression which some
Readers may think impertinent.</HEAD>
<P>BE this as it will, our lovers, though real vo∣luptuaries,
amidst the first transports of their
enjoyment, did not neglect the great political
aim of their conjunction. Teresa's bed-cham∣ber,
to which our hero constantly repaired at
midnight, was the scene of their deliberations,
and there it was determined, that the damsel, in
order to avoid suspicion, should feign herself ir∣ritated
<PB N="43" REF="52"/>
at the indifference of Ferdinand, her pas∣sion
for whom, was by this time no secret in the
family; and that with a view to countenance
this affectation, he should upon all occasions
treat her with an air of loftiness and disdain.</P>
<P>So screened from all imputation of fraud, she
was furnished by him with artful instructions,
how to sound the inclinations of her young mis∣tress;
how to recommend his person and quali∣fications
by the sure methods of contradiction,
comparison, revilings and reproach; how to
watch the paroxysms of her disposition, inflame
her passions, and improve, for his advantage,
those moments of frailty, from which no wo∣man
is exempted. In short, this consummate
politician taught his agent to poison the young
lady's mind with in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idious conversation, tending
to inspire her with the love of guilty pleasure,
to debauch her sentiments, and confound her
ideas of dignity and virtue. After all, the task
is not difficult to lead the unpractised heart
astray, by dint of those opportunities her seducer
possessed. The seeds of insinuation seasonably
sown upon the warm, luxuriant soil of youth,
could hardly fail of shooting up into such in∣temperate
desires as he wanted to produce; espe∣cially
when cultured and cherished in her un∣guarded
hours, by that stimulating discourse
which familiarity admits, and the looser passions
ingrafted in every breast, are apt to relish and
excuse.</P>
<P>Fathom had previously reconnoitred the ground,
and discovered some marks of inflammability in
Mademoiselle's constitution; her beauty was not
such as to engage her in those gaieties of amuse∣ment,
which could flatter her vanity, and dissi∣pate
<PB N="44" REF="53"/>
her ideas; and she was of an age, when
the little loves and young desires take possession
of the fancy; he therefore concluded, that she
had the more leisure to indulge those inticing
images of pleasure that youth never fails to cre∣ate,
particularly in those who, like her, were ad∣dicted
to solitude and study.</P>
<P>Teresa, full fraught with the wily injunction,
of her confederate, took the field, and opened
the campaign with such remarkable sourness in
her aspect, when Ferdinand appeared, that her
young lady could not help taking notice of her<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
affected chag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in, and asked the reason of such
apparent alteration in her way of thinking. Pre∣pared
for this question, the other replied in a
manner calculated for giving Mademoiselle to
understand, that whatever impressions Ferdinand
might have formerly made on her heart, they
were now altogether effaced by the pride and
insolence with which he had received her ad∣vances;
and that her breast now glowed with
all the revenge of a slighted lover.</P>
<P>To evince the sincerity of this declaration,
she bitterly inveighed against him, and even af∣fected
to depreciate those talents, in which she
knew his chief merit to consist; hoping by
these means to interest Mademoiselle's candour
in his defence. So far the train succeeded:
that young lady's natural love for truth was
offended at the calumnies that were vented a∣gainst
Ferdinand in his absence. She c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id her
woman for the rancour of her remarks, and
undertook to refute the articles of his dispraise:
Teresa supported her own assertions with great
obstinacy, and a dispute ensued, in which her
<PB N="45" REF="54"/>
mistress was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eated into some extravagant com∣mendations
of our adventurer.</P>
<P>His supposed enemy did not fail to make a
report of her success, and to magnify every ad∣vantage
they had gained; believing in good
earnest, that her lady's warmth was the effect
of a real passion for the fortunate Mr. Fathom:
but he himself viewed the adventure in a diffe∣rent
light; and rightly imputed the violence of
Mademoiselle's behaviour to the contradiction she
had sustained from her maid; or to the fire of
her natural generosity, glowing in behalf of in∣nocence
traduced. Nevertheless, he was per∣fectly
well pleased with the nature of the con∣test;
because, in the course of such debates,
he foresaw that he should become habitually her
hero, and that, in time, she would actually be∣lieve
those exaggerations of his merit, which she
herself had feigned for the honour of her own
arguments.</P>
<P>This presage, founded upon that principle of
self-respect, without which no individual exists,
may certainly be justified by manifold occurrences
in life: we ourselves have known a very preg∣nant
example, which we shall relate, for the
emolument of the reader. A certain needy au∣thor
having found means to present a manuscript
to one of those sons of fortune, who are digni∣fied
with the appellation of patrons, instead of
reaping that applause, and advantage, with which
he had regaled his fancy, had the mortification
to find his performance treated with infinite ir∣reverence
and contempt: and in high dudgeon
and disappointment appealed to the judgment of
another critic, who, he knew, had no veneration
for the first.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="55"/>
This common consolation, to which all baffled
authors have recourse, was productive of very
happy consequences to our bard: for though the
opinions of both judges, concerning the piece,
were altogether the same, the latter, either out
of compassion to the appellant, or desire of ren∣dering
his rival ridiculous in the eye of taste,
undertook to repair the misfortune, and in this
manner executed the plan, in a meeting of lite∣rati,
to which both these wits belonged; he who
had espoused the poet's cause, having previously
desired another member to bring his composition
on the carpet, no sooner heard it mentioned,
than he began to censure it with flagrant marks
of scorn, and with an ironical air looking at its
first condemner, observed that he must be furi∣ously
infected with the rage of patronizing, who
could take such a deplorable performance into
his protection: the sarcasm took effect.</P>
<P>The person against whom it was levelled, tak∣ing
umbrage at his presumption, assumed an as∣pect
of disdain, and replied with great animo∣sity,
that nothing was more easily supported
than the character of a Zoilus, because no pro∣duction
was altogether free from blemishes, and
any man might pronounce against any piece by
the lump, without interesting his own discern∣ment:
but to perceive the beauties of a work,
it was requisite to have learning, judgment and
taste; and therefore he did not wonder that the
gentleman had overlooked a great many in the
composition which he so contemptuously decried.
A rejoinder succeeded this reply, and produced
a long train of altercation, in which the gen∣tleman
who had formerly treated the book with
such disrespect, now prosessed himself its passion∣ate

admirer, and held forth in praise of it with
great warmth and elocution.</P>
<P>Not contented with having exhibited this in∣stance
of regard, he next morning sent a mes∣sage
to the owner, importing that he had but
superficially glanced over the manuscript, and
desiring the favour of perusing it a second time;
being indulged in this request, he recommended
it in terms of rapture, to all his friends and de∣pendants,
and by dint of unwearied sollicitation,
procured a very ample subscription for the au∣thor.</P>
<P>But, to resume the thread of our story: Te∣resa's
practices were not confined to simple defa∣mation:
her reproaches were contrived so as to
imply some intelligence in favour of the person
she reviled. In exemplifying his pertness and ar∣rogance,
she repeated his witty repartee; on pre∣tence
of blaming his ferocity, she recounted
proofs of his spirit and prowess; and in explain∣ing
the source of his vanity, gave her mistress to
understand, that a certain young lady of fashion
was said to be enamoured of his person. Nor
did this well-instructed understrapper omit those
other parts of her cue, which the principal judged
necessary for the furtherance of his scheme. Her
conversation became less guarded, and took a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reer turn than usual: she seized all opportunities
of introducing little amorous stories, the greatest
part of which were invented for the purposes of
warming her passions, and lowering the price of
chastity in her esteem; for, she represented all
the young lady's cotemporaries in point of age
and situation, as so many sensualists, who with∣out
scruple indulged themselves in the stolen
pleasures of youth.</P>

presume upon these misconstructions, that
she at length divested her tongue of all restraint,
and behaved in such a manner, that the young

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The confederates change their battery; and at∣chieve
a remarkable adventure.</HEAD>
<P>THunderstruck at this disappointment, the
confederates held a council, in order to
deliberate upon the next measures that should be
taken; and Ferdinand, for the present, despair∣ing
of accomplishing his grand aim, resolved to
profit in another manner, by the conveniency
of his situation. He represented to his help∣mate,
that it would be prudent for them to
make hay while the sun shone, as their connexi∣on
might be sooner or later discovered, and an
end put to all those opportunities which they
now so happily enjoyed. All principles of mo∣rality
had been already excluded from their for∣mer
plan; consequently, he found it an easy
task to interest Teresa in any other scheme tend∣ing
to their mutual advantage, howsoever wicked
and perfidious it might be. He therefore, per∣suaded
her to be his auxiliary in defrauding Ma∣demoiselle
at play, and gave her suitable direc∣tions
<PB N="50" REF="59"/>
for that purpose; and even tutored her
how to abuse the trust reposed in her, by em∣bezzling
the young lady's effects, without in∣curring
the suspicion of dishonesty.</P>
<P>On the supposition that every servant in the
house, was not able to resist such temptation,
the purse of her mistress (to which the maid had
always access) was dropped in a passage, which
the domestics had occasion to frequent, and Fa∣thom
posted himself in a convenient place, in
order to observe the effect of his stratagem.
Here he was not disappointed in his conjecture.
The first person who chanced to pass that way,
was one of the chambermaids, with whom Te∣resa
had lived, for some time, in a state of inve∣terate
enmity, because the wench had failed in
that homage and respect which was paid to her
by the rest of the servants.</P>
<P>Ferdinand had in his heart espoused the quar∣rel
of his associate, and longed for an occasion
to deliver her from the malicious observance of
such an antagonist; when he therefore, saw her
approach, his heart throbbed with joyful expec∣tations;
but, when she snatched up the purse,
and thrust it in her bosom, with all the eager∣ness
and confusion of one determined to appro∣priate
the windfall to her own use, his transports
were altogether unspeakable. He traced her to
her own apartment, whither she immediately
retreated with great trepidation, and then com∣municated
the discovery to Teresa, together
with instructions how to behave in the sequel.</P>
<P>In conformity with these lessons, she took
the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> opportunity of going to Mademoiselle,
and demanding money for some necessary ex∣pence,
that the loss might be known, before the
<PB N="51" REF="60"/>
finder could have leisure to make any fresh con∣veyance
of the prize; and in the mean time,
Ferdinand kept a strict eye upon the motions of
the chambermaid. The young lady having rum∣maged
her pockets in vain, expressed some sur∣prize
at the loss of her purse, upon which her
attendant gave indications of extreme amaze∣ment
and concern; she said, it could not possibly
be lost; intreated her to search her escrutore,
while she herself ran about the room, prying into
every corner, with all the symptoms of fear and
distraction. Having made this unsuccessful in∣quiry,
she pretended to shed a flood of tears,
bewailing her own fate, in being near the person
of any lady, who met with such a misfortune,
by which, she observed, her character might be
called in question: she produced her own keys,
and begged upon her knees, that her chamber
and boxes might be searched without delay.</P>
<P>In a word, she demeaned herself so artfully,
upon this occasion, that her mistress, who never
entertained the least doubt of her integrity, now
looked upon her as a miracle of fidelity and at∣tachment,
and was at infinite pains to console
her for the accident which had happened; pro∣testing
that for her own part, the loss of
the money should never affect her with a mo∣ment's
uneasiness, if she could retrieve a certain
medal which she had long kept in her purse, as
a remembrance of her deceased aunt, from whom
she received it in a present.</P>
<P>Fathom entered accidentally in the midst
of this well-acted scene, and perceiving the agi∣tation
of the maid, and the concern of the mis∣tress,
desired, in a respectful manner, to know
the cause of their disorder. Before the young
<PB N="52" REF="61"/>
lady had time to make him acquainted with the
circumstances of the case, his accomplice ex∣claimed
in an affected passion, “Mr. Fathom,
my lady has lost her purse; and as no persons in
the family are so much about her, as you and I,
you must give me leave in my own justification,
to insist upon Mademoiselle's ordering the apart∣ments
of us both to be searched without loss of
time: here are my pockets and my keys, and
you cannot scruple to give her the same satisfac∣tion;
for innocence has nothing to fear.”</P>
<P>Miss Melvile reprimanded her sharply for her
unmannerly zeal; and Ferdinand eying her with
a look of disdain, “Madam, said he, I approve
of your proposal; but before I undergo such
mortification, I would advise Mademoiselle to
subject the two chambermaids to such inquiry:
as they also have access to the apartments, and
are, I apprehend, as likely as you or I, to be∣have
in such a scandalous manner.</P>
<P>The young lady declared that she was too
well satisfied of Teresa's honesty and Ferdinand's
honour, to harbour the least suspicion of either,
and that she would sooner die than disgrace them
so far as to comply with the proposal the former
had made; but as she saw no reason for exempt∣ing
the inferior servants from that examination,
which Fathom advised, she would forthwith put
it in execution. The chambermaids being ac∣cordingly
summoned, she calmly asked if either
of them had accidentally found the purse she
had dropped, and both replying in the negative,
she assumed an air of severity and determination,
and demanding their keys, threatned to examine
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir trunks on the instant.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="62"/>
The guilty Abigail, who, though an Hunga∣rian,
was not inferior, in point of effrontery, to
any one of the sisterhood in England, no sooner
heard this menace, than she affected an air of
affronted innocence, thanked God she had lived
in many reputable families, and been trusted with
untold gold; but was never before suspected
of theft; that the other maid might do as she
should think proper, and be mean-spirited enough
to let her things be tumbled topsy-turvy and ex∣posed;
but, for her own part, if she should be
used in that inhuman and disgraceful manner,
she would not stay another hour in the house;
and in conclusion said, that Mademoiselle had
more reason to look sharp after those who en∣joyed
the greatest share of her favour, than be∣lieve
their malicious insinuations against innocent
people whom they were well known to hate and
defame.</P>
<P>This declaration implying an hint to the pre∣judice
of Teresa, far from diverting miss Mel∣vile
from her purpose, served only to inhance
the character of the accused in her opinion, and
to confirm her suspicion of the accuser, of whom
she again demanded her keys, protesting, that
should she prove refractory, the count himself
should take cognizance of the affair, whereas if
she would deal ingenuously, she should have no
cause to repent of her confession. So saying, she
desired our adventurer to take the trouble of
calling up some of the men servants; upon which
the conscious criminal began to tremble, and
falling upon her knees, acknowledged her guilt,
and implored the forgiveness of her young mis∣tress.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="63"/>
Teresa seizing this occasion to signalize her
generosity, joined in the request, and the offen∣der
was pardoned, after having restored the
purse, and promised in the fight of Heaven, that
the devil should never again intice her to the
commission of such a crime. This adventure
fully answered all the purposes of our politician;
it established the opinion of his fellow-labourer's
virtue, beyond the power of accident or infor∣mation
to shake, and set up a false beacon to
mislead the sentiments of Mademoiselle, in case
she should for the future meet with the like
misfortune.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">They proceed to levy contributions with great success,
until our hero sets out with the young count for
Vienna, where he enters into league with another
adventurer.</HEAD>
<P>UNder this secure cover, Teresa levied con∣tributions
upon her mistress with great
success. Some trinket was missing every day;
the young lady's patience began to fail, the
faithful attendant was overwhelmed with con∣sternation,
and with the appearance of extreme
chagrin, demanded her dismission, affirming that
these things were certainly effected by some per∣son
in the family, with a view of murthering
her precious reputation. Miss Melvile, not with∣out
difficulty, quieted her vexation with assur∣ances
of inviolable confidence and esteem, until
a pair of diamond ear-rings vanished, when
Teresa could no longer keep her affliction with∣in
bounds. Indeed this was an event of more
<PB N="55" REF="64"/>
consequence, than all the rest which had hap∣pened,
for the jewels were valued at five hun∣dred
florins.</P>
<P>Mademoiselle was accordingly alarmed to such
a degree, that she made her mother acquainted
with her loss, and that good lady, who was an
excellent oeconomist, did not fail to give indica∣tions
of extraordinary concern. She asked, if
her daughter had reason to suspect any indi∣vidual
in the family, and if she was perfectly
confident of her own woman's integrity: upon
which Mademoiselle, with many encomiums o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the fidelity and attachment of Teresa, recount∣ed
the adventure of the chambermaid, who im∣mediately
underwent a strict enquiry, and was
even committed to prison, on the strength of her
former misdemeanour. Our adventurer's mate
insisted upon undergoing the same tryal with
the rest of the domesticks, and as usual compre∣hended
Fathom in her insinuations; while he
seconded the proposal, and privately counselled
the old lady to introduce Teresa to the magistrate
of the place. By these pre-concerted recrimina∣tions,
they escaped all suspicion of collusion.
After a fruitless inquiry, the prisoner was dis∣charged
from her confinement, and turned out
of the service of the count, in whose private
opinion the character of no person suffered so
much, as that of his own son, whom he suspect∣ed
of having embezzled the jewels, for the use
of a certain Inamorata, who, at that time, was
said to have captivated his affections.</P>
<P>The old gentleman felt upon this occasion,
all that internal anguish which a man of honour
may be supposed to suffer, on account of a son's
deg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>racy; and without divulging his sentiments,
<PB N="56" REF="65"/>
or even hinting his suspicions to the youth him∣self,
determined to detach him at once from
such dangerous connexions, by sending him forth∣with
to Vi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nna, on pretence of finishing his
exercises at the academy, and ushering him in∣to
acquaintance with the great world. Though
he would not be thought by the young gentle∣man
himself, to harbour the least doubt of his
morals, he did not scruple to unbosom himself
on that subject to Ferdinand, whose sagacity and
virtue he held in great veneration. This indul∣gent
patron, expressed himself in the most pa∣thetic
terms, on the untoward disposition of his
son; he told Fathom that he should accompany
Renaldo (that was the youth's name) not only
as a companion, but a preceptor and pattern;
conjured him to assist his tutor in superintending
his conduct, and to reinforce the governor's
precepts, by his own example; to inculcate
upon him, the most delicate punctilio's of ho∣nour,
and decoy him into extravagance, rather
than leave the least illiberal sentiment in his
heart.</P>
<P>Our crafty adventurer, with demonstrations
of the utmost sensibility, acknowledged the
great goodness of the count in reposing such
confidence in his integrity; which, as he ob∣served,
none but the worst of villains could abuse;
and servently wished that he might no longer
exist, than he should continue to remember and
resent the obligations he owed to his kind bene∣factor.
While preparations were making for
their departure, our hero held a council with his
associate, whom he enriched with many sage
instructions touching her future operations; he
at the same time disburthened her of all or the
<PB N="57" REF="66"/>
greatest part of the spoils she had won, and after
having received divers marks of boun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y from the
count and his lady, together with a purse from
his young mistress, he set out <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or Vienna in the
eighteenth year of his age, with Renaldo and
his governor, who were provided with letters of
recommendation to some of the count's friends
belonging to the imperial court.</P>
<P>Such a favourable introduction could not fail
of being advantageous to a youth of Ferdinand's
specious accomplishments; for he was consider∣ed
as the young count's companion, admitted
into his parties, and included in all the enter∣tainments
to which Renaldo was invited. He
soon distinguished himself by his activity and ad∣dress,
in the course of those exercises that were
taught at the academy of which he was pupil;
his manners were so engaging as to attract the
acquaintance of his fellow-students, and his con∣versation
being sprightly and inoffensive, grew
into very great request; in a word, he and the
young count formed a remarkable contrast, which
in the eye of the world, redounded to his advan∣tage.</P>
<P>They were certainly, in all respects, the re∣verse
of each other. Renaldo, under a total
defect of exterior cultivation, possessed a most
excellent understanding, with every virtue that
dignifies the human heart; while the other,
beneath a most agreeable outside, with an in∣aptitude
and aversion to letters, concealed an
amazing fund of villainy and ingr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>titude. Hi∣therto,
his observation had been confined to a
narrow sphere, and his reflections, though sur∣prizingly
just and acute, had not attained to that
maturity, which age and experience give: but
<PB N="58" REF="67"/>
now, his perceptions began to be more distinct,
and extended to a thousand objects which had
never before come under his cognizance.</P>
<P>He had formerly imagined, but was now fully
persuaded, that the sons of men preyed upon one
another, and such was the end and condition
of their being. Among the principal figures of
life, he observed few or no characters that did
not bear a strong analogy to the savage tyrants of
the wood. One resembled a tyger in fury and
rapaciousness; a second prowled about like an
hungry wolf, seeking whom he might devour;
a third acted the part of a jackall, in beating the
bush for game to his voracious employer; and
a fourth imitated the wily fox, in practising a
thousand crafty ambuscades for the destruction
of the ignorant and unwary. This last was the
department of life for which he found himself
best qualified, by nature and inclination, and he
accordingly resolved that his talent should not
rust in his possession. He was already pretty well
versed in all the sciences of play; but, he had
every day, occasion to see these arts carried to
such a surprising pitch of finesse and dexterity,
as discouraged him from building his schemes on
that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oundation.</P>
<P>He therefore determined to fascinate the judg∣ment,
rather than the eyes of his fellow-crea∣tures,
by a continual exercise of that gift of de∣ceiving,
with which he knew himself endued to
an unrivalled degree; and to acquire unbounded
influence with those who might be subservient
to his interest, by an a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iduous application to
their prevailing passions. Not that play was al∣together
left out in the projection of his occo∣nomy:
though he engaged himself very little in
<PB N="59" REF="68"/>
the executive part of gaming, he had not been
long in Vienna, when he entered into league
with a genius of that kind, whom he distinguished
among the pupils of the academy, and who
indeed, had taken up his habitation in that place,
with a view to pillage the provincials on their
first arrival in town, before they could be arm∣ed
with proper circumspection to preserve their
money, or have time to dispose of it in any other
shape.</P>
<P>Similar characters naturally attract each other,
and people of our hero's principles are, of all
others, the most apt to distinguish their own
likeness wheresoever it occurs; because they al∣ways
keep the faculty of discerning in full ex∣ertion.
It was in consequence of this mutual
alertness, that Ferdinand and the stranger, who
was a native of Tyrol, perceived themselves
reflected in the dispositions of each other, and
immediately entered into an offensive and de∣fensive
alliance: our adventurer undertaking for
the articles of intelligence, countenance and
counsel; and his associate charging himself with
the risque of execution.</P>

being one night intoxicated in the course

which Fathom had purposely absented himself,
was by the Tyroleze so artfully provoked to play,

in less than an hour, stripped him of a pretty
round sum. Next day, when the young gentle∣man
recovered the use of his reflection, he was
sensibly chagrin'd at the folly and precipitation of
his own conduct, an account of which he com∣municated
in confidence to our hero, with de∣monstrations
of infinite shame and concern.</P>
<P>Ferdinand having moralized upon the subject
with great sagacity, and sharply inveighed against
the Tyroleze, for the unfair advantage he had
taken, retired to his closet and wrote the fol∣lowing
billet, which was immediately sent to

</LETTER>
<P>The gamester no sooner received this intima∣tion,
than according to the plan which had been
preconcerted betwixt the author and him, he
<PB N="61" REF="70"/>
went to the apartment of Renaldo, and present∣ing
the sum of money which he had defrauded
him of, the preceding night, told him with a
stern countenance, that though it was a just ac∣quisition,
he scorned to avail himself of his good
fortune against any person who entertained the
smallest doubt of his honour.</P>
<P>The young count, surprized at this address,
rejected his offer with disdain, and desired to
know the meaning of such an unexpected declara∣tion.
Upon which, the other produced Ferdi∣nand's
billet, and threatned in very high terms,
to meet the stripling according to his invitation,
and chastise him severely for his presumption.
The consequence of this explanation is obvious.
Renaldo imputing the officiousness of Fathom to
the zeal of his friendship, interposed in the quar∣rel,
which was amicably compromised, not a lit∣tle
to the honour of our adventurer, who thus
obtained an opportunity of displaying his cou∣rage
and integrity, without the least hazard to
his person; while at the same time, his confe∣derate
recommended himself to the esteem of the
young count, by his spirited behaviour on this
occasion; so that Rinaldo being less shy of his
company for the future, the Tyroleze had the
fairer opportunities to prosecute his designs upon
the young gentleman's purse.</P>
<P>It would be almost superfluous to say that these
were not neglected. The son of count Melvile
was not deficient in point of penetration: but,
his whole study was at that time, engrossed by
the care of his education; and he had sometimes
recourse to play, as to an amusement by which
he sought to unbend the severity of his attention:
no wonder then, that he fell a prey to an artful
<PB N="62" REF="71"/>
gamester, who had been regularly trained to the
profession, and made it the sole study of his life;
especially as the Hungarian was remarkable for
a warmth of temper, which a knight of the post
always knows how to manage for his own ad∣vantage.</P>
<P>In the course of these operations, Fathom
was a very useful correspondent; he instructed
the Tyroleze in the peculiarities of Renaldo's
disposition, and made him acquainted with the
proper seasons for profiting by his dexterity.
Ferdinand, for example, who by the authority
derived to him from the injunctions of the old
count, sometimes took upon himself the office
of an adviser, cunningly chose to counsel the
son, at those conjunctures, when he knew him
least able to bear such expostulation. Advice
improperly administred, generally acts in diame∣trical
opposition to the purpose for which it is
supposed to be given: at least this was the case
with the young gentleman, who inflamed by the
reproof of such a tutor, used to obey the dic∣tates
of his resentment, in an immediate repe∣tition
of that conduct which our adventurer had
taken the liberty to disapprove; and the game∣ster
was always at hand, to minister unto his
indignation. By these means he was disencum∣bered
of divers considerable remittances, with
which his father chearfully supplied him, on the
supposition that they were spent with taste and
liberality, under the direction of our adven∣turer.</P>
<P>But Ferdinand's views were not confined to
the narrow field of this alliance: he attempted
divers enterprizes in the world of gallantry, con∣scious
of his own personal qualifications, and never
<PB N="63" REF="72"/>
doubting that he could insinuate himself into the
good graces of some married lady about court,
or lay an opulent dowager under contribution.
But he met with an obstacle in his endeavours
of this kind, which all his art was unable to
surmount. This was no other than the obscu∣rity
of his birth, and the want of a title, with∣out
which no person in that country lays claim
to the privileges of a gentleman. Had he fore∣seen
this inconvenience, he might have made
shift to obviate the consequences, by obtaining
permission to appear in the character of the
count's kinsman: though, in all probability, such
an expedient would not have been extremely
agreeable to the old gentleman, who was very
tenacious of the honour of his family: never∣theless,
his generosity might have been prevailed
upon, to indulge Fathom with such a pretext,
in consideration of the youth's supposed attach∣ment,
and the obligations for which he deemed
himself indebted to his deceased mother.</P>
<P>True it is, Ferdinand, upon his first arrival
at Vienna, had been admitted into fashionable
company, on the footing of Renaldo's compa∣nion,
because no body suspected the defect of
his pedigree; and even after a report had been
circulated to the prejudice of his extraction, by
the industry of a lacquey who attended the young
count, there were not wanting many young peo∣ple
of distinction, who still favoured him with
their countenance and correspondence: but, he
was no longer invited to private families, in
which only he could expect to profit by
his address among the ladies, and had the morti∣fication
of finding himself frequently excepted
from parties which were expresly calculated for
<PB N="64" REF="73"/>
the entertainment of the young count. Luckily,
his spirit was so pliant as to sustain these slights,
without being much dejected: instead of repin∣ing
at the loss of that respect which had been
paid to him at first, he endeavoured with all
his might, to preserve the little that still remain∣ed,
and resolyed to translate into an humblet
sphere, that gallantry which he had no longer
opportunities of displaying in the world of ran<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and fashion.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He effects a lodgment in the house of a rich
Jeweller.</HEAD>
<P>IN consequence of this determination, he to
the uttermost exerted his good humour a∣mong
the few friends of consequence his fortun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
had left, and even carried his complaisance so
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar, as to become the humble servant of their
pleasures; while he attempted to extend his ac∣quaintance
in an inferior path of life, where he
thought his talents would shine more conspicuous
than at the assemblies of the great, and conduce
more effectually to the interest of all his designs.
Nor did he find himself disappointed in that ex∣pectation,
sanguine as it was. He soon found
means to be introduced to the house of a weal∣thy
bourgeois, where every individual was
charmed with his easy air and extraordinary qua∣lifications.
He accommodated himself surpri∣singly
to the humours of the whole family;
smoaked tobacco, swallowed wine and discoursed
of stones with the husband, who was a rich jew∣eller;
sacrificed himself to the pride and loqua∣city
<PB N="65" REF="74"/>
of the wife, and played upon the violin,
and sung alternately, for the amusement of his
only daughter, a buxom lass, nearly of his own
age, the fruit of a former marriage.</P>
<P>It was not long before Ferdinand had reason
to congratulate himself on the footing he had
gained in this society. He had expected to find,
and in a little time actually discovered that mu∣tual
jealousy and rancour, which almost always
subsist between a daughter and her step dame,
inflamed with all the virulence of female emu∣lation;
for the disparity in their ages, served
only to render them the more inveterate rivals
in the desire of captivating the other sex. Our
adventurer having deliberated upon the means of
converting this animosity to his own advantage,
saw no method for this purpose so feasible, as
that of making his approaches to the hearts of
both, by ministring to each in private, food for
their reciprocal envy and malevolence: because
he well knew that no road lies so direct and open
to a woman's heart, as that of grati<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ying her
passions of vanity and resentment.</P>
<P>When he had an opportunity of being parti∣cular
with the mother, he expressed his concern
for having unwittingly incurred the displeasure of
Mademoiselle, which, he observed, was obvious
in every circumstance of her behaviour towards
him; protesting he was utterly innocent of
all intention of offending her; and that he
could not account for his disgrace, any other
way, than by supposing she took umbrage at the
direction of his chief regards towards her mo∣ther-in-law,
which, he owned, was altogether
involuntary, being wholly influenced by that
lady's superior charms and politeness.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="75"/>
Such a declaration was perfectly well calculated
for the meridian of a dame like her, who with
all the intoxication of unenlightened pride, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
an increased appetite for pleasure, had begun to
find herself neglected, and even to believe that
her attractions were actually in the wane. She
very graciously consoled our gallant for the mis∣hap
of which he complained; representing Wil∣hemina
(that was the daughter's name) as a pert,
illiterate, envious baggage, of whose disgust he
ought to make no consideration; then she re∣counted
many instances of her own generosity
to that young lady, with the returns of malice
and ingratitude she had made; and lastly, enu∣merated
all the imperfections of her person, edu∣cation,
and behaviour; that he might see with
what justice the gypsy pretended to vye with
those who had been distinguished by the appro∣bation,
and even gallantry of the best people in
Vienna.</P>
<P>Having thus established himself her confident
and gossip, he knew his next step of promotion
would necessarily be to the degree of her lover;
and in that belief, resolved to play the same
game with Mademoiselle Wilhelmina, whose
complexion was very much a-kin to that of her
step-mother: indeed they resembled each other
too much to live upon any terms of friendship or
even decorum. Fathom, in order to enjoy a
private conversation with the young lady, never
failed to repeat his visit every afternoon, 'till at
length, he had the pleasure of finding her disen∣gaged,
the jeweller being occupied among his
workmen, and his wife gone to assist at a
lying-in.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="76"/>
Our adventurer and the daughter had already
exchanged their vows, by the expressive language
of the eyes; he had even declared himself in
some tender ejaculations which had been softly
whispered in her ear, when he could snatch an
opportunity of venting them, unperceived; nay,
he had upon divers occasions, gently squeezed
her fair hand, on pretence of tuning her harpsi∣chord,
and been favoured with returns of the
same cordial pressure: so that instead of accost∣ing
her with the fearful hesitation and reserve of
a timid swain, he told her, after the exercise of
the doux-yeux, that he was come to confer with
her upon a subject that nearly concerned her
peace; and asked if she had not observed of late,
an evident abatement of friendship in her mo∣ther's
behaviour to him, whom she had formerly
treated with such marks of favour and respect.
Mademoiselle would not pay so ill a compliment
to her own discernment as to say she had not
perceived the alteration, which, on the contrary,
she owned was extremely palpable; nor was it
difficult to divine the cause of such estranged
looks. This remark was accompanied with an
irresistible glance, she smiled inchanting, the
colour deepened on her cheeks, her breast be∣gan
to heave, and her whole frame underwent
a most agreeable confusion.</P>
<P>Ferdinand was not a man to let such a favour∣able
conjuncture pass unregarded. “Yes,
charming Wilhelmina! exclaimed the politician
in an affected rapture, the cause is as conspicu∣ous
as your attractions. She hath in spite of all
my circumspection, perceived that passion which
it is not in my power to conceal, and in conse∣quence
of which, I now declare myself your
<PB N="68" REF="77"/>
devoted adorer; or, conscious of your superior
excellence, her jealousy hath taken the alarm,
and though stung with conjecture only, repine<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
at the triumph of your perfections. How far
this spirit of malignity may be inflamed to my
prejudice, I know not: perhaps as this is the
first, it may be also the last opportunity, I shall
have of avowing the dearest sentiments of my
heart, to the fair object that inspired them; in a
word, I may be for ever excluded from your pre∣fence.
Excuse me then, divine creature! from
the practice of those unnecessary forms, which I
should take pride in observing, were I indulged
with the ordinary privileges of an honourable
lover; and once for all, accept the homage of
an heart overflowing with love and admiration.
Yes, adorable Wilhelmina! I am dazzled with
your supernatural beauty; your other accomplish∣ments
strike me with wonder and awe. I am
enchanted by the graces of your deportment▪
ravished with the charms of your conversation▪
and there is a certain tenderness of benevolence
in that endearing aspect, which, I trust will not
fail to melt with sympathy at the emotions of a
faithful slave like me.”</P>
<P>So saying, he threw himself upon his knees,
and seizing her plump hand, pressed it to his lips
with all the violence of real transport. The
nymph, whose passions nature had filled to the
brim, could not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear such a rhapsody unmoved:
being an utter stranger to addresses of this kind,
she understood every word of it, in the literal
acceptation; she believed implicitly in the truth
of the encomiums he had bestowed, and thought
it reasonable he should be rewarded for the jus∣tice
he had done to her qualifications, which
<PB N="69" REF="78"/>
had hitherto been almost altogether over-looked:
in short, her heart began to thaw, and her face
to hang out the flag of capitulation, which was
no sooner perceived b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> our hero, than he re∣newed
his attack with redoubled fervour, pro∣nouncing
in a most vehement tone, “Light of
my eyes, and empress of my soul! behold me
prostrate at your feet, waiting with the most
pious resignation, for that sentence from your
lips, on which my future happiness and misery
must altogether depend. Not with more reve∣rence
does the unhappy bashaw kiss the Sultan's
letter that contains his doom, than I will submit,
to your fatal determination. Speak then, ange∣lic
sweetness! for, never, ah never will I rise
from this suppliant po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ure, until I am encou∣raged
to live and hope. No! if you refuse to
smile upon my passion, here shall I breathe the
last sighs of a despairing lover: here shall this
faithful sword do the last office to its unfortunate
master, and shed the blood of the truest heart
that ever felt the cruel pangs of disappointed
love.”</P>
<P>The young lady, well nigh overcome by this
effusion, which brought the tears into her eyes,
“Enough, enough, cried she, interrupting him,
sure you men were created for the ruin of our
sex.” “Ruin, re-ecchoed Fathom, talk not of
ruin and Wilhelmina! let these terms be for
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver parted, far as the east and west asunder!
let ever smiling peace attend her steps, and love
and joy still wanton in her train! Ruin indeed,
shall wait upon her enemies, if such there be,
and those love-lorn wretches who pine with
anguish under her disdain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> grant me, kind
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eaven a more propitious boon: direct her ge∣nial
<PB N="70" REF="79"/>
regards to one whose love is without exam∣ple,
and whose constancy is unparalleled: bear
witness to my constancy and faith, ye verdant
hills, ye fertile plains, ye shady groves, ye purl∣ing
streams: and if I prove untrue, ah! let me
never find a solitary willow or a bubling brook,
by help of which I may be enabled to put a
period to my wretched life.”</P>
<P>Here this excellent actor began to sob most
piteously, and the tender-hearted Wilhelmina, un∣able
longer to withstand his moving tale, with a
repetition of the interjection ah! gently dropp'd
into his arms. This was the beginning of a
correspondence that soon rose to a very interest∣ing
pitch; and they forthwith concerted mea∣sures
for carrying it on, without the knowledge
or suspicion of her mother-in-law. Neverthe∣less
the young lady, vanquished as she was, and
unskilled in the ways of men, would not all at
once yield at discretion; but insisted upon those
terms, without which no woman's reputation
can be secured. Our lover far from seeking to
evade the proposal, assented to it in terms of
uncommon satisfaction, and promised to use his
whole industry in finding a priest, upon whose
discretion they could rely; nay, he certainly
resolved to comply with her request in good
earnest, rather than forfeit the advantages which
he foresaw in their union. His good fortune,
however, exempted him from the necessity of
taking such a step, which at best must have
been disagreeable: for so many difficulties occurred
in the enquiry which was set on foot, and so
artfully did Fathom in the mean time manage
the influence he had already gained over her
heart, that before her passion could obtain a
<PB N="71" REF="80"/>
legal gratification, she surrendered to his wish,
without any other assurance, than his solemn
profession of sincerity and truth, on which she
reposed herself with the most implicit confidence
and faith.</P>

<DIV2 N="13" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He is exposed to a most perilous incident in the
course of his intrigue with the daughter.</HEAD>
<P>HE was rejoiced to find her so easily satisfied
in such a momentous concern: for the
principal aim of the intrigue was to make her
necessary to his interested views, and even, if
possible, an associate in the fraudulent plans he
had projected upon her father; consequently he
considered this relaxation in her virtue, as an
happy omen of his future success. All the ob∣stacles
to their mutual enjoyment being thus re∣moved,
our adventurer was by his mistress, in∣dulged
with an assignation in her own chamber,
which, though contiguous to that of her step∣mother,
was provided with a door that opened
into a common stair-case, to which he had ac∣cess
at all hours of the night.</P>
<P>He did not neglect the rendezvous, but, pre∣senting
himself at the appointed time, which
was midnight, made the signal they had agreed
upon, and was immediately admitted by Wil∣helmina,
who waited for him with a lover's im∣patience.
Fathom was not deficient in those
expressions of rapture, that are current on such
occasions; but, on the contrary, became so
loud in the transports of self-congratulation, that
his voice reached the ears of the vigilant step∣mother,
who wakening the jeweller from his

person was certainly in close conversatio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
with his daughter; and exhorted him to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
forthwith, and vindicate the honour of his fa∣mily.</P>
<P>The German, who was naturally of a phleg∣matic
habit, and never went to bed without<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
full dose of the creature, which added to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

would have made his retreat immediately, throug<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
the port by which he entered, had not his inten∣tion
been over-ruled by the remonstrances <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the young lady, who observed that the door <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
already fast bolted, and could not possibly b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
opened without creating a noise that would con∣firm
the suspicion of her parents; and that over
and above this objection, he would, in sallying
from that door, run the risque of being met by
her father, who in all probability, would prese<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
himself besore it, in order to hinder our hero'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

her closet, where she assured him he might re∣main
with great tranquillity, in full confidence
that she would take such measures, as would effec∣tually
screen him from detection.</P>
<P>He was fain to depend upon her assurance, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
accordingly insconced himself behind her dress<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing
table; but he could not help sweating with<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
apprehension, and praying servently to God for
his deliverance, when he heard the jewelle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
thundring at the door, and calling to his daugh∣ter
for admittance. Wilhel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, who was already
<PB N="73" REF="82"/>
undressed, and had purposely extinguished the
light, pretended to be suddenly waked from her
sleep, and starting up, exclaimed in a tone of
surprize and affright, “Jesu, Maria! what is
the matter?” Hussey! replied the German in a
terrible accent, open the door this instant, there
is a man in your bed-chamber; and by the light∣ning
and thunder! I will wash away the stain he
has cast upon my honour with the schellum's
heart's-blood.</P>
<P>Not at all intimidated by this boisterous threat,
she admitted him without hesitation, and with
a shrillness of voice peculiar to herself, began to
hold forth upon her own innocence and his
unjust suspicion, mingling in her harangue, sun∣dry
oblique hints against her mother in law,
importing that some people were so vitiously
inclined by their own natures, that she did not
wonder at their doubting the virtue of other
people; but that these people despised the insi∣nuations
of such people, who ought to be more
circumspect in their own conduct, lest they
themselves should suffer reprisals from those peo∣ple
whom they had so maliciously slandered.</P>
<P>Having uttered these flowers of rhetoric, which
were calculated for the hearing of her step-dame,
who stood with a light at her husband's back,
the young lady assumed an ironical air, and ad∣monished
her father to search every corner of
her apartment; she even affected to assist his
inquiry; with her own hands pulled out a par∣cel
of small drawers, in which her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> inkets were
contained; desired him to look into her needle
case and thimble, and seeing his examination
fruitless, earnestly intreated him to rummage her
closet also, saying with a sneer, that in all pro∣bability,
<PB N="74" REF="83"/>
the dishonourer would be sound in that
lurking-place. The manner in which she pre∣tended
to ridicule his apprehensions, made an
impression upon the jeweller, who was very
well disposed to retreat into his own nest, when
his wife, with a certain slyness in her counte∣nance,
besought him to comply with his daugh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter's
request, and look into that same closet;
by which means Wilhelmina's virtue would ob∣tain
a compleat triumph.</P>
<P>Our adventurer, who overheard the conver∣sation,
was immediately seized with a palsy of
fear: he trembled at every joint, the sweat
trickled down his forehead, his teeth began to
chatter, his hair to stand on end, and he in his
heart, bitterly cursed the daughter's petu∣lance,
the mother's malice, together with his
own precipitation, by which he was involved
in an adventure so pregnant with danger
and disgrace. Indeed, the reader may easily
conceive his disorder, when he heard the key
turning in the lock, and the German swearing
that he would make him food for the beasts of
the field and the fowls of the air.</P>
<P>Fathom had come unprepared with weapons
of defence, was naturally an oeconomist of his
person, and saw himself on the brink of forfeit∣ing
not only the promised harvest of his double
intrigue, but also the reputation of a man of
honour, upon which all his future hopes depend<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed:
his agony was therefore unspeakable, when
the door flew open, and it was not till after a
considerable pause of recollection, that he per∣ceived
the candle extinguished by the motion of
the air produced from the German's sudden irrup∣tion.
This accident, which disconcerted him so
<PB N="75" REF="84"/>
much as to put a full stop to his charge, was
very favourable to our hero, who summoning
all his presence of mind, crept up into the chim∣ney,
while the jeweller stood at the door, wait∣ing
for his wife's return with another light; so
that when the closet was examined, there was
nothing found to justify the report which the
step-mother had made; and the father, after hav∣ing
made a slight apology to Wilhelmina, for
his intr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sion, retired with his yoke-fellow into
their own chamber.</P>
<P>The young lady who little thought that her
papa would have taken her at her word, was
overwhelmed with confusion and dismay, when
she saw him enter the closet, and had her lover
been discovered, would in all probability have
been the loudest in his reproach, and perhaps,
have accused him of an intention to rob the
house: but, she was altogether astonished when
she found he had made shift to elude the in∣quiry
of her parents, because she could not con∣ceive
the possibility of his escaping by the win∣dow,
which was in the third story, at a prodi∣gious
distance from the ground; and how he
could conceal himself in the apartment, was a
mystery which she could by no means unfold<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Before her father and mother retired, she <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ighted
her lamp, on pretence of being afraid to be in
the dark, after the perturbation of spirits she had
undergone, and her room was no sooner eva∣cuated
of such troublesome visitants, than she
secured the doors, and went in quest of her
lover.</P>
<P>Accordingly, every corner of the closet un∣derwent
a new search, and she called upon his
name with a soft voice, which she thought no
<PB N="76" REF="85"/>
other person would overhear: but Ferdinan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
did not think proper to gratify her impatience<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
because he could not judge of the predicamen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in which he stood by the evidence of all his
senses, and would not relinquish his post, unti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
he should be better certified that the coast wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
clear. Mean while, his Dulcinea having per∣formed
her inquiry to no purpose, imagine<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
there was something preternatural in the circum∣stance
of his vanishing so unaccountably, and
began to cross herself with great devotion. She
returned to her chamber, fixed the lamp in the
fire-place, and throwing herself upon the bed<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
gave way to the suggestions of her superstition▪
which were reinforced by the silence that pre∣vailed,
and the gloomy glimmering of the light
She reflected upon the trespass she had already
committed in her heart, and in the conjecture
of her fear, believed that her lover was no other
than the devil himself, who had assumed the ap∣pearance
of Fathom, in order to tempt and se∣duce
her virtue.</P>
<P>While her imagination teemed with thos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
horrible ideas, our adventurer concluding from
the general stillness, that the jeweller and his
wife were at last happily asleep, ventured <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
come forth from his hiding-place, and stood be∣fore
his mistress, all begrimed with soot. Wil∣helmina
lifting up her eyes, and seeing this sa∣ble
apparition, which she mistook for Satan i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
propria persona, instantly screamed, and bega<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to repeat her Pater-noster with an audible voice
upon which Ferdinand, fore-seeing that her pa∣rents
would be again alarmed, would not stay t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
undeceive her, and explain himself; but unlock∣ing
the door with great expedition, ran down∣stairs,
<PB N="77" REF="86"/>
and luckily accomplished his escape. This
was undoubtedly the wisest measure he could have
taken: for, he had not performed one half of
his descent toward the street, when the Ger∣man
was at his daughter's bed-side, demanding
to know the cause of her exclamation: she then
gave him an account of what she had seen, with
all the exaggerations of her own fancy, and af∣ter
having weighed the circumstances of her
story, he interpreted the apparition into a thief,
who had found means to open the door that
communicated with the stair, but having been
scared by Wilhelmina's shriek, had been ob∣liged
to retreat before he could execute his
purpose.</P>
<P>Our hero's spirits were so woefully disturbed
by this adventure, that for a whole week he f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lt
no inclination to visit his inamorata, and was
not without apprehension that the affair had ter∣minated
in an explanation very little to his ad∣vantage.
He was, however, delivered from this
disagreeable suspence, by an accidental meeting
with the jeweller himself, who kindly chid
him for his long absence, and entertained him
in the street, with an account of the alarm
which his family had sustained, by a thief who
broke into Wilhelmina's apartment. Glad to find
his apprehension mistaken, he renewed his cor∣respondence
with the family, and in a little
time, found reason to console himself for the
jeopardy and panic he had undergone.</P>

away by the domestic duties of the house. The
passions of the jeweller's wife were in such
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>state of exaltation as exempted our hero from
the repulses and fatigue attending a long siege.</P>
<P>We have already observed how cunningly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
catered for the gratification of her ruling appe∣tite,
and have exhibited pregnant proofs of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
ability in gaining upon the human heart; the
reader will not therefore be surprized at the ra∣pidity
of his conquest over the affections of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
lady whose complexion was perfectly amoro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
and whose vanity laid her open to all the at∣tempts
of adulation. In a word, matters were
quickly brought to such a mutual understanding <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
that one evening, while they amused themselves
at lansquenet, Fathom conjured her to give
him the rendezvous next day, at the house <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
any third person of her own sex, in whose dis∣cretion
she could confide; and after a few affect∣ed
scruples on her side, which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> well knew
how to surmount, she complied with his re∣quest,
<PB N="79" REF="88"/>
and the circumstances of the appoint∣ment
were settled accordingly. After this treaty,
their satisfaction rose to such a warmth, and the
conversation became so reciprocally endearing,
that our gallant expressed his impatience of wait∣ing
so long for the accomplishment of his wishes;
and with the most eager transport, begged she
would, if possible, curtail the term of his ex∣pectation,
that his brain might not suffer by his
standing so many tedious hours on the giddy
verge of rapture.</P>
<P>The dame, who was naturally compassionate,
sympathized with his condition, and unable to
resist his pathetic supplications, gave him to un∣derstand
that his desire could not be granted,
without subjecting them both to some hazard,
but that she was disposed to run any risque in
behalf of his happiness and peace. After this
affectionate preamble, she told him that her hus∣band
was then engaged in a quarterly meeting
of the jewellers, from whence he never sailed
to return quite over-whelmed with wine, to∣bacco,
and the phlegm of his own constitution;
so that he would fall fast asleep as soon as his
head should touch the pillow; and she be at
liberty to entertain the lover without interrup∣tion,
provided he could find means to deceive
the jealous vigilance of Wilhelmina, and conceal
himself in some corner of the house, unsuspected
and unperceived.</P>
<P>Our lover remembring his adventure with the
daughter, would have willingly dispensed with
this expedient, and began to repent of the eager∣ness
with which he had preferr'd his sollicitation;
but, seeing there was now no opportunity of
retracting with honour, he affected to enter hear∣tily
<PB N="80" REF="89"/>
into the conversation, and after much can∣vassing,
it was determined that while Wilhelmina
was employed in the kitchen, the mother should
conduct our adventurer to the outward door,
where he should pay the compliment of parting,
so as to be overheard by the young lady, but in
the mean time, glide softly into the jeweller's
bed-chamber, which was a place they imagined
least liable to the effects of a daughter's prying
disposition; and conceal himself in a large press
or wardrobe, that stood in one corner of the
apartment. The scene was immediately acted
with great success, and our hero cooped up in
his cage, where he waited so long, that his de∣sires
began to subside, and his imagination to
aggravate the danger of his situation.</P>
<P>“Suppose,” said he to himself, “this brutal
German, instead of being stupified with wine,
should come home inflamed with brandy, to the
use of which he is sometimes addicted; far from
feeling any inclination to sleep, he will labour
under the most fretful anxiety of watching,
every irascible particle in his disposition will be
exasperated: he will be offended with every ob∣ject
that may present itself to his view, and if
there is the least ingredient of jealousy in his
temper, it will manifest itself in riot and rage.
What if his frenzy should prompt him to search
his wife's chamber for gallants? this would cer∣tainly
be the first place to which he would direct
his inquiry; or, granting this supposition chi∣merical,
I may be seized with an irresistible in∣clination
to cough, before he is oppressed with
sleep: he may be waked by the noise I shall make
in disengaging myself from this embarrassed situa∣tion;
and finally, I may find it impracticable to
<PB N="81" REF="90"/>
retire unseen or unheard, after every thing else
shall have succeeded to my wish.”</P>
<P>These suggestions did not at all contribute to
the quiet of our adventurer, who, having waited
three whole hours in the most uncomfortable sus∣pence,
heard the jeweller brought into the room
in that very condition which his fears had prog∣nosticated.
He had, it seems, quarrelled over
his cups with another tradesman, and received a
salutation on the forehead with a candlestick,
which, not only left an ignominious and painful
mark upon his countenance, but even disordered
his brain to a very dangerous degree of delirium:
so that, instead of allowing himself quietly to be
undressed and put to bed by his wife, he answer∣ed
all her gentle admonitions and caresses, with
the most opprobrious invectives and obstreperous
behaviour; and though he did not tax her with
insidelity to his bed, he virulently accused her
of extravagance and want of oeconomy, observ∣ed
her expensive way of living would bring him
to a morsel of bread, and unfortunately recol∣lecting
the attempt of the supposed thief, start∣ed
up from his chair, swearing by God's mother,
that he would forthwith arm himself with a bra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
of pistols, and search every apartment of the
house. “That press,” said he with great voci∣feration,
“may for aught I know, be the recep∣tacle
of some ruffian.”</P>
<P>So saying, he approached the ark in which
Fathom was embarked, and exclaiming “Come
forth, Satan,” applied his foot to the door of it,
with such violence as threw him from the centre
of gravity, and laid him sprawling on his back.
This address made such an impression upon our
adventurer, that he had well nigh obeyed the
<PB N="82" REF="91"/>
summons, and burst from his concealment, in a
desperate effort to escape, without being recogniz∣ed
by the intoxicated German: and indeed had
the application been repeated, he in all likelihood
would have tried the experiment; for, by this
time, his terrors had waxed too strong to be much
longer suppressed: from this hazardous enterprize,
he was however exempted by a lucky accident that
happened to his disturber, whose head chancing to
pitch upon the corner of a chair, in his fall, he
was immediately lulled into a trance; during
which, the considerate lady guessing the disorder
of her gallant, and dreading further interruption,
very prudently released him from his confinement,
after the had put out the light, and in the dark
conveyed him to the door, where he was com∣forted
with the promise that she would punctu∣ally
remember the rendezvous of next day.</P>
<P>She then invoked the assistance of the servants,
who being waked for the purpose, lifted up their
master, and tumbled him into bed, while Ferdi∣nand
hied him home in an universal sweat, bles∣sing
himself from any future atchievement of
that sort, in an house, where he had been twice
in such imminent danger of life and reputation.
Nevertheless, he did not fail to honour the assig∣nation,
and avail himself of the disposition his
mistiess manifested, to make him all the recom∣pence
in her power, for the disappointment and
chagrin which he had undergone.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">But at length succeeds in his attempts upon both.</HEAD>
<P>HAving thus gained a compleat victory over
the affections of these two ladies, he be∣gan
to convert his good fortune to the purposes
of that principle, from which his view was ne∣ver,
no no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for a moment, detached. In other
words, he used them as ministers and purveyors
to his avarice and fraud. As for the mother-in-law,
she was of herself so liberal as to anticipate
the wisnes of any moderate adventurer, and pre∣sented
him with sundry valuable jewels, as me∣morials
of her esteem; nor was the daughter
backward in such expressions of regard; she al∣ready
considered his interest as her own, and
took <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>requent opportunities of secreting for his
benefit, certain stray trinkets that she happened
to pick up in her excursions within doors.</P>
<P>All these gratifications he received with de∣monstrations
of in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inite constraint and reluctance,
and in the midst of his rapacious extortion, acted
so cunningly as to impose himself upon both, for
a miracle of disinterested integrity. Yet not
contented with what he thus could earn, and
despairing of being able to steer the bark of his
fortune for any length of time, between two
such dangerous quicksands, her-esolved to profit
by the occasion while it lasted, and strike some
considerable stroke at once. A plan was formed
in consequence of this determination, and at an
appointment with the mother, in the house of
their female friend, our adventurer appeared with
an air of dejection, which he veiled with a thin
<PB N="84" REF="93"/>
cover of forced pleasantry, that his mistress
might suppose he endeavoured to conceal some
mortal chagrin that preyed upon his heart.</P>
<P>The stratagem succeeded to his wish: she ob∣served
his countenance between whiles over-cast,
took notice of the involuntary sighs he heaved;
and with the most tender expressions of sympathy,
conjured him to make her acquainted with the
cause of his affliction. Instead of gratifying her
request immediately, he evaded her questions
with a respectful reserve, implying, that his love
would not suffer him to make her a partner in his
sorrow; and this delicacy on his part, whetted her
impatience and concern to such a degree, that
rather than keep her in such an agony of doubt and
apprehension, he was prevailed upon to tell her,
that he had been the preceding night, engaged
with a company of his fellow-students, where
he had made too <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ree with the champaigne, so
that his caution forsook him, and he had been
decoyed into a play by a Tyroleze gamester, who
stripped him of all his ready money, and ob∣tained
from him, an obligation for two hundred
florins, which he could not possibly pay, with∣out
having recourse to his relation the count de
Melvile, who would have just cause to be incensed
at his extravagance.</P>
<P>This information he concluded, by declaring,
that cost what it would, he was resolved to make
a candid confession of the truth, and throw him∣self
entirely upon the generosity of his patron,
who could inflict no other punishment than that
of discarding him from his favour and protection:
a misfortune, which how grievous soever it
might be, he should be able to sustain with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or∣titude,
could he fall upon some method of satis∣fying
<PB N="85" REF="94"/>
the Tyrolese, who was very importunate
and savage in his demand. His kind mistress no
sooner found out the source of his inquietude,
than she promised to dry it up, assuring him that
next day at the same hour, she would enable him
to discharge the debt; so that he might set his
heart at ease, and recollect that gaiety which was
the soul of her enjoyment.</P>
<P>He expressed the utmost astonishment at this
generous proffer, which, however, he declined
with an affected earnestness of refusal, protesting
that he should be extremely mortified, if he
thought she looked upon him as one of those
mercenary gallants, who could make such a for∣did
use of a lady's affection. “No madam,”
cried our politician in a pathetic strain, “what∣ever
happens, I shall never part with that inter∣nal
consolation that conscious honour never
fails to yield in the deepest scenes of solitary di∣stress:
the attachment I have the honour to pro∣fess
for your amiable person, is not sounded on
such inglorious motives; but, is the genuine re∣sult
of that generous passion, which none but
the noble-minded feel, and the only circum∣stance
of this misfortune, that I dread to en∣counter,
is, the necessity of withdrawing myself
for ever, from the presence of her whose genial
smiles could animate my soul against all the per∣secution
of adverse fortune.”</P>
<P>This declamation, accompanied with a pro∣sound
sigh, served only to inflame her desire of
extricating him from the difficulty in which he
was involved. She exhausted all her eloquence
in attempting to persuade him that his refusal
was an outrage against her affection: he pre∣tended
to resute her arguments, and remained
<PB N="86" REF="95"/>
unshaken by all the power of her sollicitations<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
until she had recourse to the most passionate re∣monstrances
of love, and fell at his feet in the
posture of a forlorn shepherdess. What he re∣fused
to her reason, he granted to her tears, be∣cause
his heart was melted by her affliction, and
next day, condescended to accept of her money,
out of pure regard to her happiness and peace.</P>
<P>Encouraged by the success of this atchieve∣ment,
he resolved to practise the same experi∣ment
upon Wilhelmina, in hope of extracting
an equal share of profit from her simplicity and
attachment; and at their very next nocturnal
rendezvous in her chamber, re-acted the farce
already rehearsed; with a small variation, which
he thought necessary to stimulate the young lady
in his behalf. He rightly concluded, that she
was by no means mistress of such a considerable
sum as he had already extorted from her mother<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and therefore thought proper to represent him∣self
in the most urgent predicament, that her ap∣prehension,
on his account, might be so alarmed,
as to engage her in some enterprize for his ad∣vantage,
which, otherwise, she would never
have dreamed of undertaking. With this view,
after having described his own calamitous situa∣tion,
in consequence of her pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssing intreaties,
which he affected to evade, he gave her to un∣derstand
that there was no person upon earth,
to whom he would have recourse in this emer∣gency;
for which reason, he was determined to
rid himself of all his cares at once, upon the
friendly point of his own faithful sword.</P>
<P>Such a dreadful resolution could not fail to
operate upon the tender passions of his Dulcinea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
she was instantly seized with an agony of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="87" REF="96"/>
and distraction: her grief manifested itself in a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lood of tears, while she hung round his neck,
conjuring him in the most melting terms, by
their mutual love, in which they had been so
happy, to lay aside that fatal determination,
which would infallibly involve her in the same
fate; for, she took Heaven to witness, that she
would not one moment survive the knowledge
of his death.</P>
<P>He was not deficient in expressions of reci∣procal
regard: he extolled her love and tender∣ness
with a most extravagant eulogium; and
seemed wrung with mortal anguish at the pros∣pect
of parting for ever from his lovely Wil∣helmina;
but his honour was a stern and rigid
creditor, that could not be appeased, except with
his blood; and all the boon she could obtain, by
dint of the most woeful supplication, was a pro∣mise
to defer the execution of his baleful purpose,
for the space of four and twenty hours, during
which, she hoped, Heaven would compassionate
her sufferings, and inspire her with some contri∣vance
for their mutual relief. Thus he yielded
to her fervent request, rather with a view to
calm the present transports of her sorrow, than
with any expectation of seeing himself redeemed
from his fate, by her interposition; such at least
were his professions, when he took his leave,
assuring her, that he would not quit his being,
before he should have devoted a few hours to
another interview with the dear object of his
love.</P>
<P>Having th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> kindled the train, he did not
doubt that the mine of his craft would take ef∣fect,
and repaired to his own lodging, in full
persuasion of seeing his aim accomplished, before
<PB N="88" REF="97"/>
the time fixed for their last assignation. His
prognostic was next morning verified by the arri∣val
of a messenger, who brought to him a small
parcel, to which was cemented with sealing∣wax,
the following epistle.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>“Jewel of my soul!</OPENER>
<P>Scarce had you, last night, quitted my dis∣consolate
arms, when I happily recollected
that there was in my possession, a gold chain,
of value more than sufficient to answer the
exigence of your present occasions: it was
pledged to my grandfather for two hundred
crowns, by a knight of Malta, who soon af∣ter
perished in a sea-engagement with the
enemies of our faith; so that it became the
property of our house, and was bequeathed
to me by the old gentleman, as a memorial
of his particular affection. Upon whom can
I more properly bestow it, than him who is
already master of my heart! receive it, there∣fore,
from the bearer of this billet, and con∣vert
it without scruple to that use which
shall be most conducive to your ease and sa∣tisfaction;
nor seek, from a too romantic
notion of honour, which I know you enter∣tain,
to excuse yourself, from accepting this
testimony of my affection: for, I have al∣ready
sworn before an image of our blessed
lady, that I will no longer own you as the
sovereign of my heart, nor even indulge you
with another interview, if you reject this
mark of tenderness and concern, from your
ever faithful.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>WILHELMINA.”</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="89" REF="98"/>
The heart of our adventurer began to bound
with joy, when he surveyed the contents of this
letter; and his eyes sparkled with transport at
sight of the chain, which he immediately per∣ceived
to be worth twice the sum she had men∣tioned.
Nevertheless, he would not avail him∣self
without further question of her generosity;
but, that same night, repairing to her apartment
at the usual hour of meeting, he prostrated him∣self
before her, and counterfeiting extreme agi∣tation
of spirit, begged in the most urgent terms,
not even unaccompanied with tears, that she
would take back the present which he tendered
for her acceptance; and spare him the most in∣sufferable
mortification of thinking himself ex∣posed
to the imputation of being mercenary in
his love. Such, he said, was the delicacy of
his passion, that he could not possibly exist under
the apprehension of incurring a censure so un∣worthy
of his sentiments; and he would a thou∣sand
times, sooner undergo the persecution of
his rancorous creditor, than bear the thought
of being in the smallest consideration lessened
in her esteem: nay, so far did he carry his pre∣tensions
to punctilio, as to protest that should
she refuse to quiet the scruples of his honour,
on this score, her unyielding beneficence would
serve only to hasten the execution of his deter∣mined
purpose, to withdraw himself at once
from a life of vanity and misfortune.</P>
<P>The more pathetically he pleaded for her com∣pliance,
the more strenuously did she resist his
remonstrances. She advanced all the arguments
her reason, love and terror could suggest, re∣minded
him of her oath, from which, he could
not suppose she would recede, whatever the con∣sequence
<PB N="90" REF="99"/>
might be; and in conclusion, vowe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to Heaven with great solemnity and devotion,
that she would not survive the news of his death.
Thus the alternative she offered, was either to
retain the chain and be happy in her affection,
or forfeit all title to her love, and die in the con∣viction
of having brought his innocent mistre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
to an untimely grave.</P>
<P>His fortitude was not proof against this last
consideration: “My savage honour,” said he,
“would enable me to endure the pangs of eter∣nal
separation, in the confidence of being endowed
with the power of ending these tortures by the
energy of my own hand; but, the prospect o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Wilhelmina's death, and that too occasioned by
my inflexibility, disarms my soul of all her re∣solution,
swallows up the dictates of my jealo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
pride, and fills my bosom with such a gush o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
tenderness and sorrow, as overwhelms the whole
oeconomy of my purpose! Yes, inchanting crea∣ture!
I sacrifice my glory to that irresistible re∣flection:
and rather than know myself the cru<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
instrument of robbing the world of such perfec∣tion,
consent to retain the fatal testimony <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
your love.”</P>
<P>So saying, he pocketed the chain, with an
air of ineffable mortification, and was rewarded
for his compliance with the most endearing c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣resses
of his Dulcinea, who amidst the tumul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of his joy, ejaculated a thousand acknowledg∣ments
to Heaven, for having blessed her with
the affection of such a man, whose honour was

<HEAD TYPE="sub">His success begets a blind security, by which he is
once again well nigh entrapped in his Dulcinea's
apartment.</HEAD>
<P>IN this manner did the crafty Fathom turn to
account those ingratiating qualifications he
inherited from nature; and maintain with in∣credible
assiduity and circumspection, an amorous
correspondence with two domestic rivals, who
watched the conduct of each other, with the
most indefatigable virulence of envious suspicion,
until an accident happened, which had well-nigh
overturned the bark of his policy, and induced
him to alter the course, that he might not be
shipwrecked on the rocks that began to multiply
in the prosecution of his present voyage.</P>
<P>The jeweller, who, as a German, wanted
neither pride nor ostentation, never failed to cele∣brate
the anniversary of his birth, by an annual
feast granted to his neighbours and friends; and
on these occasions, was accustomed to wear that
chain, which though bequeathed to his daughter,
he considered as an ornament appertaining to
the family, whereof he himself was head: ac∣cordingly,
when the time of this festival revolved,
he as usual, ordered Wilhelmina to surrender it
for the day. This injunction, the reader will
perceive, our young lady was in no condition to
obey; she had, however, foreseen the demand,
and contrived a scheme of behaviour, for the
occasion, which she forthwith put in execu∣tion.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="101"/>
With an air of uncommon chearfulness pur∣posely
assumed, she retired to her closet, on pre∣tence
of complying with his desire, and having
employed a few minutes in rummaging her
drawers, and disordering her moveables, uttered
a loud shriek, that brought her father instantly
into the apartment, where he found his daughter
tossing about her cloaths and trinkets, with vio∣lent
demonstrations of disorder and affright, and
heard her in a lamentable strain declare, that she
was robbed of her chain, and for ever undone.
This was so far from being an agreeable intima∣tion
to the jeweller, that he was struck dumb
with astonishment and vexation, and it was not
till after a long pause, that he pronounced the
word Sacrament! with an emphasis, denoting
the most mortifying surprize.</P>
<P>Soon as that exclamation escaped from his
lips, he flew to the scrutore as if instinctively, and
joining Wilhelmina in her occupation, tumbled
its whole contents upon the floor, in a trice.</P>
<P>While he was thus employed, in the most
expressive silence, the wife of his bosom chanced
to pass that way, and seeing them both occu∣pied,
with such violence and trepidation, believed
at first, that they were certainly actuated by the
spirit of frenzy; but when she interposed, by
asking with great earnestness, the cause of such
transports and distracted behaviour; and heard
her husband reply with an accent of despair,
“The chain! the chain of my forefathers is no
more.” She immediately justified his emotion,
by undergoing the same alarm, and without fur∣ther
hesitation, engaged herself in the search,
beginning with a song, which might be compar∣ed
to the hymn of battle among the Greeks, or
<PB N="93" REF="102"/>
rather more aptly, to that which the Spartan
females sung round the altar of Diana, surnamed
Orthian: for, it was attended with strange gesti∣culations,
and in the course of utterance, be∣came
so loud and shrill, that the guests, who
were by this time partly assembled, being con∣founded
at the clamour, rushed towards the
place from whence it seemed to proceed, and
found their landlord, with his wife and daughter
in the attitudes of distraction and despair.</P>
<P>When they understood the nature of the case,
they condoled the family on their misfortune,
and would have retired, on the supposition that
it would defeat the mirthful intent of their
meeting; but the jeweller mustering up his
whole temper and hospitality, intreated them to
excuse his disorder, and favour him with their
company, which, he observed, was now more than
ever wanted, to dispel the melancholy ideas in∣spired
by his loss. Notwithstanding this apology,
and the efforts he made in the sequel, to enter∣tain
his friends with jollity and good humour,
his heart was so linked to the chain, that he
could not detach himself from the thoughts of
it, which invaded him at short intervals, in such
qualms as effectually spoiled his appetite and hin∣dered
his digestion.</P>
<P>He revolved within himself, the circumstances
of his disaster, and in canvassing all the probable
means, by which the chain could be stolen, con∣cluded
that the deed must have been done by
some person in the family, who, in consequence
of having access to his daughter's chamber, had
either found the drawer left open by her care∣lessness
and neglect, or found means to obtain a
false key, by some waxen impression: for, the
<PB N="94" REF="103"/>
locks of the escritore were safe and uninjured.
His suspicion being thus confined within his own
house, sometimes pitched upon his workmen,
and sometimes upon his wife, who, he thought,
was the more likely to practise such finesle, as
she considered Wilhelmina in the light of a
daughter in-law, whose interest interfered with
her own, and who had often harangued to him in
private, on the folly of leaving this very chain
in the young lady's possession.</P>
<P>The more he considered this subject, he
thought he saw the more reason to attribute the
damage he had sustained, to the machinations
of his spouse, who, he did not doubt, was
disposed to feather her own nest, at the expence
of him and his heirs, and who, with the same
honest intention had already secreted for her pri∣vate
use, those inconsiderable jewels which of
late had at different times, been missing. Ar∣roused
by these sentiments, he resolved to re∣taliate
her own schemes, by contriving means
to visit her cabinet in secret, and if possible, to
rob the robber, of the spoils she had gathered to
his prejudice, without coming to any explanation,
which might end in domestic turmoils and eter∣nal
disquiet.</P>
<P>While the husband exercised his reflection in
this manner, his innocent mate did not allow
the powers of her imagination to rest in idleness
and sloth. Her observations touching the loss of
the chain were such, as a suspicious woman,
biassed by hatred and envy, would naturally
make. To her it seemed highly improbable,
that a thing of such value, so carefully deposited,
should vanish without the connivance of its
keeper, and without much expence of conjec∣ture,
<PB N="95" REF="104"/>
divined the true manner in which it was
conveyed. The sole difficulty that occurred in
the researches of her sagacity, was to know the
gallant, who had been favoured with such a
pledge of Wilhelmina's affection; for as the
reader will easily imagine, she never dreamed of
viewing Ferdinand in that odious perspective.
In order to satisfy her curiosity, discover this
happy favourite, and be revenged on her petulant
rival, she prevailed upon the jeweller to employ
a scout, who should watch all night upon the
stair, without the knowledge of any other per∣son
in the family, alledging, that in all likeli∣hood,
the house-maid gave private admittance
to some lover, who was the author of all the
losses they had lately suffered, and that they
might possibly detect him in his nocturnal ad∣ventures;
and observing that it would be impru∣dent
to intimate their design to Wilhelmina,
left through the heedlessness and indiscretion of
youth, she might chance to divulge the secret,
so as to frustrate their aim.</P>
<P>A Swiss, in whose honesty the German could
confide, being hired for this purpose, was posted
in a dark corner of the stair-case, within a few
paces of the door, which he was directed to
watch, and actually stood centinel three nights,
without perceiving the least object of suspicion;
but on the fourth, the evil stars of our adven∣turer
conducted him to the spot, on his voyage
to the apartment of his Dulcinea, with whom
he had had pre-concerted the assignation. Having
made the signal, which consisted of two gentle
taps on her door, he was immediately admitted,
and the Swiss, no sooner saw him fairly housed,
than he crept softly to the other door, that was
<PB N="96" REF="105"/>
left open for the purpose, and gave immediate inti∣mation
of what he had perceived: this intelli∣gence,
however, he could not convey so secretly
but the lovers, who were always vigilant upon
these occasions, overheard a sort of commotion
in the jeweller's chamber, the cause of which
their apprehension was ingenious enough to com∣prehend.</P>
<P>We have formerly observed, that our adven∣turer
could not make his retreat by the door
without running a very great risque of being de∣tected,
and the expedient of the chimney h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
had no inclination to repeat; so that he found
himself in a very uncomfortable dilemma, and
was utterly abandoned by all his invention an
address; when his mistress in a whisper, desire
him to begin a dialogue, aloud, in an apology
importing, that he had mistaken the door; and
that his intention was to visit her father, touch∣ing
a ring belonging to the young count Me∣vile,
which, she knew, Fathom had put into
his hands, in order to be altered.</P>
<P>Ferdinand seizing the hint, availed himself <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
it, without delay, and unbolting the door, pro∣nounced
in an audible voice, “Upon my ho∣nour,
Mademoiselle, you wrong my intention
if you imagine I came hither with any disrespect∣ful
or dishonourable motive: I have business with
your father, which cannot be delayed till to-mor∣row,
without manifest prejudice to my friend
and myself; therefore I took the liberty of visu∣ing
him at these untimely hours; and it has been
my misfortune to mistake the door in the dark
I beg pardon for my involuntary intrusion; and
again assure you, that nothing was farther from
my thoughts, than any design to violate the
<PB N="97" REF="106"/>
respect, which I have always entertained for you
and your father's family.”</P>
<P>To this remonstrance, which was distinctly
heard by the German and his wife, who by this
time, stood listening at the door, the young
lady replied in a shrill accent of displeasure,
“Sir, I am bound to believe that all your ac∣tions
are conducted by honour; but, you must
give me leave to tell you, that your mistake is a
little extraordinary, and your visit even to my
father at this time of the night, altogether un∣seasonable,
if not mysterious. As for the inter∣ruption
I have suffered in my repose, I impute
it to my own forgetfulness, in leaving my door
unlocked, and blame myself so severely for the
omission that I shall tomorrow put it out of my
own power to be guilty of the like for the future,
by ordering the passage to be nailed up; mean
while, if you would persuade me of your well∣meaning,
you will instantly withdraw, left my
reputation should suffer by your continuance in
my apartment.”</P>
<P>“Madam, answered our hero, I will not
give you an opportunity to repeat the command,
which I shall forthwith obey, after having in∣treated
you once more, to forgive the distur∣bance
I have given.” So saying, he gently opened
the door, and at sight of the German and his
wife, who, he well knew, waited for his exit,
started back, and gave tokens of confusion which
was partly real and partly affected. The jewel∣ler
fully satisfied with Fathom's declaration to
his daughter, received him with a complai∣sant
look, and in order to alleviate his con∣cern,
gave him to understand that he already
knew the reason of his being in that apartment,
<PB N="98" REF="107"/>
and desired to be informed of what had pro∣cured
him the honour to see him at such a junc∣ture.</P>
<P>“My dear friend, said our adventurer, pre∣tending
to recollect himself with difficulty. I
am utterly ashamed and confounded to be dis∣covered
in this situation; but as you have over∣heard
what past between Mademoiselle and me,
I know you will do justice to my intention and
forgive my mistake. After begging pardon for
having intruded upon your family at these hours,
I must now tell you, that my cousin count Mel∣vile
was som<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> time ago so much misrepresented
to his mother, by certain malicious informers,
who delight in sowing discord in private families,
that she actually believed her son an extrava∣gant
spendthrist, who had not only consumed
his remittances in the most riotous scenes of dis∣order,
but also indulged a pernicious appetite
for gaming to such a degree, that he had lost
all his cloaths and jewels at play. In conse∣quence
of such false information, she expostu∣lated
with him in a severe letter, and desired he
would transmit to her that ring which is in
your custody, it being a family stone, for which
she expressed an inestimable value. The young
gentleman, in his answer to her reproof, endea∣voured
to vindicate himself from the aspersions
which had been cast upon his character, and
with regard to the ring, told her it was at pre∣sent
in the hands of a jeweller, in order to be
new set, according to her own directions, and
that whenever it should be altered, he would
send it home to her by some safe conveyance.
This account the good lady took for an evasion,
and upon that supposition, has again written to
<PB N="99" REF="108"/>
him, in such a provoking stile, that although
the letter arrived but half an hour ago, he is de∣termined
to dispatch a courier before morning
with the mischievous ring, for which, in compli∣ance
with the impetuosity of his temper, I have
taken the freedom to disturb you at this unsea∣sonable
hour.</P>
<P>The German paid implicit faith to every cir∣cumstance
of this story, which indeed could not
well be supposed to be invented extempore; the
ring was immediately restored, and our adven∣turer
took his leave, congratulating himself up∣on
his signal deliverance from the snare in which
he had fallen.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The step-dame's suspicions being awakened, she lays
a snare for our adventurer, from which he is
delivered by the interposition of his good genius.</HEAD>
<P>THough the husband swallowed the bait,
without further inquiry, the penetration
of the wise was not so easily deceived: that
same dialogue in Wilhelmina's apartment, far
from allaying, rather inflamed her suspicion, be∣cause
in the like emergency, she herself had
once profited by the same, or nearly the same
contrivance. Without communicating her doubts
to the father, she resolved to double her atten∣tion
to the daughter's future conduct, and keep
such a strict eye over the behaviour of our gal∣lant,
that he should find it very difficult, if not
impossible, to elude her observation. For this
purpose, she took into her pay an old maiden,
of the right sour disposition, who lived in an
<PB N="100" REF="109"/>
house opposite to her own, and directed her to
follow the young lady in all her out-goings,
whenever she should receive from the window a
certain signal, which the mother-in-law agreed
to make for the occasion. It was not long before
this scheme succeeded to her wish: the door of
communication, betwixt Wilhelmina's apartment
and the stair case, being nailed up, by the jewel∣ler's
express order, our adventurer was altogether
deprived of those opportunities he had hitherto
enjoyed; and was not at all mortified to find
himself so restricted, in a correspondence which
began to be tiresome and disagreeable: but the
case was far otherwise with his Deleinea, whose
passion, the more it was thwarted, raged with
greater violence, like a fire, that from the at∣tempts
that are made to extinguish it, gathers
greater force, and flames with double fury.</P>
<P>Upon the second day of her misfortune, she
had written a very tender billet, lamenting her
unhappiness, in being deprived of those meetings
which constituted the chief joy of her life, and
intreating him to contrive some means of re∣newing
the delicious commerce in an unsuspect∣ed
place. This intimation she proposed to
convey privately into the hand of her lover, dur∣ing
his next visit to the family; but both were
so narrowly eyed by the mother, that she found
the execution of her design impracticable; and
next forenoon, on pretence of going to church,
repaired to the house of a companion, who be∣ing
also her confidante, undertook to deliver the
billet with her own hand.</P>
<P>The she-dragon employed by her mother, in
obedience to the sign, which was displayed from
the window, immediately put on her veil, and
<PB N="101" REF="110"/>
followed Wilhelmina at a distance, until she
saw her fairly housed: she would not even then,
return from her excursion, but hovered about in
sight of the door, with a view of making further
observations: in less than five minutes after
the young lady disappeared, the scout perceived
her coming out, accompanied by her comrade,
from whom she instantly parted, and bent her
way towards the church in good earnest, while
the other steered her course in another direction.
The duenna, after a moment's suspence and con∣sideration,
divined the true cause of this short
visit, and resolved to watch the motions of the
confidante, whom she traced to the academy in
which our hero lodged, and from which she
saw her return, after the supposed message was
delivered.</P>
<P>Fraught with this intelligence, the rancorous
understrapper, hied her home to the jeweller's
wife, and made a faithful recital of what she had
seen; communicating, at the same time, her own
conjectures on the subject. Her employer was
equally astonished and incensed at this informa∣tion:
she was seized with all that frenzy which
takes possession of a slighted woman, when she
finds herself supplanted by a detested rival; and
in the first transports of her indignation, devoted
them as sacrifices to her vengeance: nor was
her surprize so much the effect of his diffi nulation,
as of his want of taste and discernment. She in∣veighed
against him, not as the most treache∣rous
lover, but as the most abject wretch, in
courting the smiles of such an aukward dowdy,
while he enjoyed the favours of a woman, who
had numbered princes in the train of her admi∣rers.
For the brilliancy of her attractions, such
<PB N="102" REF="111"/>
as they at present shone, she appealed to the
decision of her minister, who consulted her own
satisfaction and interest, by flattering the others
vanity and resentment: and so unaccountable
did the depravity of our hero's judgment appear
to this conceited dame, that she began to believe
there was some mistake in the person, and to
hope that Wilhelmina's gallant was not in reality
her professed admirer Mr. Fathom, but rather
one of his fellow lodgers, whose passion he fa∣voured
with his mediation and assistance.</P>
<P>On this notion, which nothing but meer va∣nity
could have inspired, in opposition to so
many more weighty presumptions, she took the
resolution of bringing the affair to a fuller ex∣planation,
before she would concert any mea∣sures
to the prejudice of our adventurer, and
forthwith dispatched her spy back to his lodgings
to sollicit on the part of Wilhelmina an immedi∣ate
answer to the letter he had received. This was
an expedition with which the old maiden would
have willingly dispensed, because it was founded
upon an uncertainty, which might be attended
with troublesome consequences; but rather then
be the means of retarding a negociation, so pro∣ductive
of that sort of mischief which is parti∣cularly
agreeable to all of her tribe, she un∣dertook
to manage and effect the discovery, in
full confidence of her own talents and expe∣rience.</P>
<P>With such a fund of self sufficiency and insti∣gation,
she repaired to the academy on the in∣stant,
and inquiring for Mr. Fathom, was in∣troduced
to his apartment, where she found him
in the very act of writing a billet to the jewel∣ler's
daughter. The artful agent having asked,
<PB N="103" REF="112"/>
with the mysterious air of an expert go between,
if he had not lately received a message from a
certain young lady; and being answered in the
affirmative, gave him to understand, that she her∣self
was a person favoured with the friendship
and confidence of Withelmina, whom she had
known from her cradle, and often dandled on
her knee; then in the genuine stile of a prat∣ling
dry-nurse, she launched out in encomiums
on his Dulcinca's beauty and sweetness of tem∣per,
recounting many simple occurrences of her
infancy and childhood; and finally, desiring a
more circumstantial answer to that which she
had sent to him by her friend Catherina. In
the course of her loquacity, she had also, accord∣ing
to her instructions, hinted at the misfortune
of the door; and on the whole, performed her
cue with such dexte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity and discretion, that our
politician was actually over-reached, and having
finished his epistle, committed it to her care,
with many verbal expressions of eternal love and
fidelity to his charming Wilhelmina.</P>
<P>The messenger doubly rejoiced at her atchieve∣ment,
which not only recommended her mi∣nistry,
but also gratified her malice, returned to
her principal with great exultation, and deliver∣ing
the letter, the reader will easily conceive
the transports of that lady, when she read the
contents of it in these words.</P>

<CLOSER><SIGNED>FATHOM.”</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Had our hero murdered her father, or left her
a disconsolate widow, by effecting the death of
her dear husband, there might have been a pos∣sibility
of her exerting the christian virtues of
resignation and sorgiveness; but such a personal
outrage as that contained in this epistle, preclud∣ed
all hope of pardon, and rendered penitence
of no signification. His atrocious crime being
now fully ascertained, this virago gave a loose
to her resentment, which became so loud and
tempestuous, that her informer shuddered at
the storm she had raised, and began to repent
of having communicated the intelligence which
seemed to have such a violent effect upon her
brain.</P>
<P>She endeavoured, however, to allay the agi∣tation,
by flattering her fancy with the prospect
<PB N="105" REF="114"/>
of revenge, and gradually soothed her into a
state of deliberate ire; during which she deter∣mined
to take ample vengeance on the delinquent.
In the zenith of her rage, she would have had
immediate recourse to poison or steel, had she not
been diverted from her mortal purpose, by her
counsellor, who represented the danger of engag∣ing
in such violent measures, and proposed a
more secure scheme, in the execution of which
she would see the persidious wretch sufficiently
punished, without any hazard to her own person
or reputation. She advised her to inform the
jeweller of Fathom's efforts, to seduce her con∣jugal
fidelity, and impart to him a plan, by
which he would have it in his power, to detect
our adventurer in the very act of practising upon
her virtue.</P>
<P>The lady relished her proposal, and actually
resolved to make an assignation with Ferdinand,
as usual, and give notice of the appointment
to her husband, that he might personally discover
the treachery of his pretended friend, and inflict
upon him such chastisement, as the German's
brutal disposition should suggest, when inflamed
by that species of provocation. Had this project
been brought to bear, Ferdinand in all likelihood,
would have been disqualified from engaging in
any future intrigue; but fate ordained, that the
design should be defeated, in order to reserve him
for more important occasions.</P>
<P>Before the circumstances of the plan could
be adjusted, it was his good fortune to meet his
Dulcinea in the street, and in the midst of their
mutual condolance on the interruption they had
suffered in their correspondence, he assured her,
that he would never give his invention respite,
<PB N="106" REF="115"/>
until he should have verified the protestations
contained in the letter he had delivered to her
discreet agent. This allusion to a billet she have
never received, did not fail to alarm her fears,
and introduce a very mortifying explanation, in
which he so accurately described the person of
the messenger, that she forthwith comprehended
the plot, and communicated to our hero her sen∣timents
on that subject.</P>
<P>Though he expressed infinite anxiety and cha∣grin
at this misfortune, which could not fail to
raise new obstacles to their love, his heart was a
stranger to the uneasiness he affected; and ra∣ther
pleased with the occasion, which would
furnish him with pretences to withdraw himself
gradually, from an intercourse by this time be∣come
equally cloying and unprofitable. Being
well acquainted with the mother's temperament,
he guessed the present situation of her thoughts,
and concluding she would make the jeweller a
party in her revenge, he resolved from that mo∣ment
to discontinue his visits, and cautiously
guard against any future interview with the lady,
whom he had rendered so implecable.</P>
<P>It was well for our adventurer that his good
fortune so seasonably interposed; for that same
day, in the afternoon, he was favoured with a
billet from the jeweller's wife, couched in the
same tender stile she had formerly used, and im∣porting
an earnest desire of seeing him next day,
at the wonted rendezvous. Although his pene∣tration
was sufficient to perceive the drift of this
message; or at least, to discern the risque he
should run, in complying with her request, yet
he was willing to be more fully certified of the
truth of his suspicion, and wrote an answer to
<PB N="107" REF="116"/>
the billet, in which he assured her, that he would
repair to the place of appointment, with all the
punctuality of an impatient lover. Nevertheless,
instead of performing this promise, he, in the
morning, took post in a public house opposite
to the place of assignation, in order to recon∣noitre
the ground, and about noon had the plea∣sure
of seeing the German wrapped in a cloak,
enter the door of his wife's she-friend, though
the appointment was fixed at five in the evening.
Fathom blessed his good angel, for having con∣ducted
him clear of this conspiracy, and kept
his station with great tranquility, till the hour
of meeting, when he beheld his enraged Tha∣lestris
take the same route, and enjoyed her dis∣appointment
with ineffable satisfaction.</P>
<P>Thus favoured with a pretext, he took his
leave of her, in a letter, giving her to understand,
that he was no stranger to the barbarous snare
she had laid for him; and upbraiding her with
having made such an ungrateful return for all
his tenderness and attachment. She was not
backward in conveying a reply to this expestu∣lation,
which seemed to have been dictated in
all the distraction of a proud woman who sees
her vengeance baffled, as well as her love dis∣dained.
Her letter was nothing but a succession
of reproaches, menaces, and incoherent execra∣tions.
She taxed him with knavery, insensibility
and dissimulation; imprecated a thousand curses
upon his head, and threatned not only to perse∣cute
his life with all the arts that hell and ma∣lice
could inspire, but also to wound him in the
person of her daughter-in-law, who should be
inclosed for life in a convent, where she would
have leisure to repent of those loose and diser∣derly
<PB N="108" REF="117"/>
practices, which he had taught her to
commit, and of which she could not pretend in∣nocence,
as they had it in their power to con∣front
her with the evidence of her lover's own
confession. Yet all this denunciation was quali∣fied
with an alternative, by which he was given
to understand, that the gates of mercy were still
open, and that penitence was capable of wash∣ing
out the deepest stain of guilt.</P>
<P>Ferdinand read the whole remonstrance with
great composure and moderation, and was con∣tent
to incur the hazard of her hate, rather
than put her to the trouble of making such an
effort of generosity, as would induce her to for∣give
the heinous offence he had committed; nor
did his apprehension for Wilhelmina in the least
influence his behaviour on this occasion: so
zealous was he for her spiritual concerns, that
he would have been glad to hear she had actu∣ally
taken the veil; but he knew such a step
was not at all agreeable to her disposition, and
that no violence would be offered to her inclina∣tions
on that score, unless her step-mother should
communicate to the father that letter of Fa∣thom
which she had intercepted, and by which
the German would be convinced of his daughter's
backsliding; but this measure, he rightly sup∣po'ed,
the wife would not venture to take, lest
the husband, instead of taking her advice, touch∣ing
the young lady, should seek to compromise
the affair, by offering her in marriage to her
debaucher; a proffer, which, if accepted, would
overwhelm the mo her with vexation and despair.
He therefore chose to trust to the effects of
lenient time, which he hoped would gradually
weaken the resentment of this Penthesilea, and
<PB N="109" REF="118"/>
dissolve his connexion with the other parts of the
family, from which he longed to be totally de∣ached.</P>
<P>How well soever he might have succeeded in
his attempts to shake off the yoke of the mother,
who by her situation in life was restrained from
prosecuting those measures her resentment had
planned against his fortitude and indifference;
he would have found greater difficulty than he
had foreseen, in disengaging himself from the
daughter, whose affections he had won under
the most solemn professions of honour and fide∣lity;
and who, now she was debarred of his com∣pany
and conversation, and in danger of losing
him for ever, had actually taken the resolution
of disclosing the amour to her father, that he
might interpose in behalf of her peace and repu∣tation,
and secure her happiness by the sanction
of the church.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Our hero departs from Vienna, and quits the do∣main
of Venus for the rough field of Mars.</HEAD>
<P>LUckily for our adventurer, before he ad∣hered
to this determination, the young
count de Melvile was summoned to Presburg
by his father, who desired to see him, before
he should take the field, in consequence of a
rupture between the emperor and the French
king; and Fathom of course, quitted Vienna,
in order to attend his patron, after he and Re∣naldo
had resided two whole years in that capital,
where the former had made himself perfect in
all the polite exercises, become master of the
<PB N="110" REF="119"/>
French tongue, and learned to speak the Italian
with great facility; over and above those other
accomplishments in which we have represented
him as an inimitable original.</P>
<P>As for the young count, his exteriors were so
much improved by the company to which he
had access, since his departure from his father's
house, that his parents were equally surprised
and overjoyed at the alteration. All that auk∣wardness
and rusticity, which hung upon his de∣portment,
was, like the rough coat of a diamond,
polished away; the connexion and disposition of
his limbs seemed to have been adjusted anew;
his carriage was become easy, his air perfectly
genteel, and his conversation gay and unrestrain∣ed.
The merit of this reformation was in a
great measure ascribed to the care and example
of Mr. Fathom, who was received by the old
count and his lady with marks of singular friend∣ship
and esteem; nor was he over-looked by
Mademoiselle, who still remained in a state of
celibacy, and seemed to have resigned all hope
of altering her condition; she expressed uncom∣mon
satisfaction at the return of her old favour∣ite,
and re-admitted him into the same degree
of familiarity with which he had been honoured
before his departure.</P>
<P>The joy of Teresa was so excessive at his ar∣rival,
that she could scarce suppress her raptures,
so as to conceal them from the notice of the
family; and our here, upon this occasion, per∣formed
the part of an exquisite actor, in dissem∣bling
those transports which his bosom never
know. So well had this pupil retained the les∣sons
of her instructor, that in the midst of those
fraudulent appropriations, which she still conti∣nued
<PB N="111" REF="120"/>
to make, she had found means to support
her interest and character with Mademoiselle,
and even to acquire such influence in the fa∣mily,
that no other servant male or female,
could pretend to live under the same roof, with∣out
paying incessant homage to this artful wait∣ing-woman,
and yielding the most abject sub∣mission
to her will.</P>
<P>The young gentlemen having tarried at Pres∣burg
about six weeks, during which a small
field equipage was prepared for Renaldo, they
repaired to the camo at Heilbron, under the
auspices of count Melvile, in whose regiment
they carried arms, as volunteers, with a view to
merit promotion in the service, by their own
personal behaviour. Our adventurer would have
willingly dispensed with this occasion of signaliz∣ing
himself, his talents being much better a∣dapted
to another sphere of life; nevertheless,
he affected uncommon alacrity at the prospect of
gathering laurels in the field, and subscribed to
his fortune with a good grace; forseeing that
even in a campaign, a man of his art and inge∣nuity,
might find means to consult his corporal
safety, without any danger to his reputation.
Accordingly, before he had lived full three weeks
in camp, the damp situation and sudden change
in his way of life, had such a violent effect up∣on
his constitution, that he was deprived of the
use of all his limbs, and mourned without cea∣sing,
his hard fate, by which he found him∣self
precluded from all opportunity of exert∣ing
his diligence, courage and activity, in the
character of a soldier, to which he now as∣pired.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="121"/>
Renaldo, who was actually enamoured of a
martial life, and missed no occasion of distin∣guishing
himself, consoled his companion, with
great cordiality, encouraged him with the hope
of seeing his constitution familiarized to the in∣conveniences
of a camp, and accommodated
him with every thing which he thought would
alleviate the pain of his body, as well as the
anxiety of his mind. The old count, who sin∣cerely
sympathized with his affliction, would
have persuaded him to retire into quarters, where
he could be carefully nursed, and provided with
every thing necessary to a person in his condi∣tion;
but, such was his desire of glory, that
he resisted his patron's importunities, with great
constancy, till at length, seeing the old gentle∣man
obstinately determined to consult his health,
by removing him from the field, he gradually
suffered himself to recover the use of his hands,
made shift to sit up in his bed, and amuse him∣self
with cards or back gammon, and notwith∣standing
the feeble condition of his legs, ventur∣ed
to ride out on horseback, to visit the lines;
though the count and his son would never yield
to his solicitations so far, as to let him accom∣pany
Renaldo in those excursions and reconnoit∣ring
parties by which a volunteer inures him∣self
to toil and peril, and acquires that know∣ledge
in the operations of war, which qualifies
him for a command in the service.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this exemption from all duty,
our adventurer managed matters so as to pass
for a youth of infinite mettle, and even ren∣dered
his backwardness and timidity subservient
to the support of that character, by expressing
an impatience of lying inactive, and a desire
<PB N="113" REF="122"/>
of signalizing his prowess, which even the dis∣abled
condition of his body could scarce restrain.
He must be a man of very weak nerves and ex∣cessive
irresolution, who can live in the midst of
actual service, without imbibing some portion of
military fortitude; danger become<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> habitual, and
loses a great part of its terror; and as fear is of∣ten
caught by contagion, so is courage commu∣nicated
among the individuals of an army.
The hope of fame, desire of honours and pre∣ferment,
envy, emulation, and the dread of
disgrace, are motives which co-operate in sup∣pressing
that aversion to death or mutilation,
which nature hath implanted in the human mind;
and therefore, it is not to be wondered at, if
Fathom, who was naturally chicken-hearted,
gained some advantages over his disposition, be∣fore
the end of the campaign, which happened
to be neither perilous nor severe.</P>
<P>During the winter, while both armies remain∣ed
in quarters, our adventurer attended his pa∣tron
to Presburg, and before the troops were
in motion, Renaldo obtained a commission, in
consequence of which, he went into garrison at
Philipsburg, whither he was followed by our
hero, while the old count's duty called him to
the field in a different place. Ferdinand, for
some time had no reason to be dissatisfied with
this disposition, by which he was at once deli∣vered
from the fatigues of a campaign, and the
inspection of a severe censor, in the person of
count Melvile; and his satisfaction was still in∣creased
by an accidental meeting with the Tyro∣lese,
who had been his confederate at Vienna,
and now chanced to serve in garrison, on the
same footing with himself. These two knights∣errant
<PB N="114" REF="123"/>
renewed their former correspondence, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
as all soldiers are addicted to gaming, levied con∣tributions
upon all those officers who had mo∣ney
to lose, and temerity to play.</P>
<P>However they had not long pursued the
branch of traffic, when their success was inter∣rupted
by a very serious occurrence, that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the present intirely detached the gentlemen
the garrison from such amusements. The French
troops invested fort Kehl, situated on the Rhi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
opposite to Strasburg, and the Imperialists dre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ing
that the next storm would fall upon Philip<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
burg, employed themselves with great diligence
to put that important sortress in a proper p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ture
of defence. If the suspension of play w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
displeasing to our hero, the expectation of being
besieged was by no means more agreeable. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
knew the excellence of the French engineer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the power of their artillery, and the perseverance
of their general: he felt, by anticipation, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
toils of hard duty upon the works, the horro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of night-alarms, cannonading, bombardment
sallies and mines blown up; and deliberate<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
with himself, whether or not he should private<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
withdraw, and take refuge among the besiege<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
but, when he reflected that such a step
besides the infamy that must attend it, would
be like that of running upon Scylla, seeking to
avoid Char bdis, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s he would be exposed t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
more danger and inconvenience in the trenche<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
than he could possibly undergo in the town, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
after all run the risque of being taken and treated
as a deserter; upon these considerations, he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

to mitigate the rigour of his fate, by those arts <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="115" REF="124"/>
had formerly practised with success. He ac∣cordingly
found means to enjoy a very bad state
of health during the whole siege, which lasted
about six weeks after the trenches were opened;
and then the garrison marched out by capitula∣tion,
with all the honours of war.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">He puts himself under the guidance of his associate,
and stumbles upon the French camp, where he
finishes his military carreer.</HEAD>
<P>NOthing else of moment was transacted
during that campaign; and in the winter,
our adventurer, with the young count, and his
friend the Tyrolese, were d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sposed in quarters
of cantonment, where Ferdinand made himself
amends for the chagrin he had undergone, by
the exercise of those talents in which he excelled.
Not that he was satisfied with the sphere of life
in which he acted; though he knew himself
consummate in the art of play, he was not at
all ambitious of a gamester's name; nor did he
find himself disposed to hazard those discoveries
and explanations to which heroes of that class
are sometimes necessarily exposed. His aim was
to dwell among the tents of civil life, undisturb∣ed
by quarrels and the din of war, and render
mankind subservient to his interest, not by stra∣tagems
which irritate, but by that suppleness of
insinuation, which could not fail to sooth the
temper of those on whom he meant to prey.</P>
<P>He saw, that all his expectations of count Mel∣vile's
future favour, were connected with his
choice of a military life; and that his promo∣tion
<PB N="116" REF="125"/>
in the service would, in a great measure,
depend upon his personal behaviour in such
emergencies as he did not at all wish to encoun∣ter.
On the other hand, he consided so much
in his own dexterity and address, that he never
doubted of being able to rear a splendid fortune
for himself, provided he could once obtain a
fixed and firm foundation. He had in fancy,
often enjoyed a prospect of England, not
only as his native country, to which, like a true
citizen, he longed to be united; but also as the
land of promise, flowing with milk and honey,
and abounding with subjects on which he knew
his talents would be properly exercised.</P>
<P>These reflections never occurred, without
leaving a strong impression upon the mind of our
adventurer, which influenced his deliberations,
in such a manner, as at length amounted to a
perfect resolution of withdrawing himself pri∣vately
from a service that teemed with disa∣greeable
events; and of transporting himself
into the country of his ancestors, which he con∣sidered
as the Canaan of all able adventurers.
But, previous to his appearance on that stage,
he was desirous of visiting the metropolis of
France, in which he hoped to improve himself
in the knowledge of men and things, and ac∣quire
such intelligence as would qualify him to
act a more important part upon the British scene.
After having for sometime indulged these prospects
in secret, he determined to accommodate him∣self
with the company and experience of the
Tyrolese, whom, under the specious title of an
associate, he knew he could convert into a very
serviceable tool, in forwarding the execution of his
own projects.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="126"/>
Accordingly, the inclination of this confede∣rate,
was founded by distant hints, and being
found apt, our hero made him privy to his de∣sign
of decamping without beat of drum; though,
at the same time, he begged his advice, touch∣ing
the method of their departure, that he might
retire with as much delicacy as the nature of
such a step would permit. Divers consultations
were held upon this subject, before they adhered
to the resolution of making their escape from
the army, after it should have taken the field in
the spring; because, in that case, they would
have frequent opportunities of going abroad on
foraging parties, and during one of these excur∣sions,
might retire in such a manner as to per∣suade
their companions, that they had fallen into
the enemy's hands.</P>
<P>Agreeable to this determination, the camp
was no sooner formed in Alsace, than our asso∣ciates
began to make preparations for their march,
and had already taken all the previous measures
for their departure, when an accident happened,
which our hero did not fail to convert to his
own advantage: this was no other than the de∣sertion
of Renaldo's valet, who, in consequence
of a gentle chastisement, which he had richly
merited, thought proper to disappear, after having
plundered his master's portmanteau, which he had
forced open for the purpose. Ferdinand, who was
the first person that discovered the theft, imme∣diately
comprehended the whole adventure, and
taking it for granted, that the delinquent would
never return, resolved to finish what the fugitive
had imperfectly performed.</P>
<P>Being favoured with the unreserved confidence
of the young count, he instantly had recourse
<PB N="118" REF="127"/>
to his bureau, the locks of which, he found means
to burst open, and examining a private drawer
contrived with great art to conceal Renaldo's
jewels and cash, made himself master of the
contents without hesitation; then cutting open
his cloak bag, and strewing the tent with his
linnen and cloaths, began to raise his voice, and
produce such a clamour as alarmed the whole
neighbourhood, and brought a great many officers
into the tent.</P>
<P>He on this, as on all other occasions, per∣formed
his cue to a miracle, expressing confusion
and concern so naturally, in his gestures and ex∣clamation,
that no man could possibly suspect
his sincerity; nay, to such a degree of finesse
did his cunning amount, that when his friend
and patron entered, in consequence of an inti∣mation
he soon received of his loss, our ad∣venturer
exhibited undoubted signs of distrac∣tion
and delirium, and springing upon Renaldo
with all the frantic fury of a bedlamite, “Vil∣lain!”
cried he, “restore the effects you have
stole from your master, or you shall be immedi∣ately
committed to the care of the prêvot.”
However mortified M. de Melvile might be, at
his own misfortune, the condition of his friend
seemed to touch him more nearly; he under∣valued
his own loss, as a trifle that could be
easily repaired, said every thing which he thought
would tend to sooth and compose the agitation
of Ferdinand, and finally prevailed upon him
to retire to rest. The calamity was wholly
attributed to the deserter, and Renaldo, far from
suspecting the true author, took occasion, from
his behaviour on this emergency, to admire him
as a mirrour of integrity and attachment; in
<PB N="119" REF="128"/>
such an exquisite manner did he plan all his de∣signs,
that almost every instance of his fraud
furnished matter of triumph to his reputation.</P>
<P>Having thus profitably exercised his genius,
this subtle politician, thought it high time to
relinquish his military expectations, and securing
all his valuable acquisitions about his own person,
rode out with his understrapper, in the midst of
fifty dragoons who went in quest of forage.
While the troopers were employed in making up
their trusses, the two adventurers advanced to∣wards
the skirt of a wood, on pretence of re∣connoitring,
and the Tyroleze, who undertook
to be our hero's guide, directing him to a path
which led towards Strasburg, they suddenly va∣nished
from the eyes of their companions, who
in a few minutes hearing the report of several
pistols, which the confederates purposely fired,
conjectured that they had fallen in with a party
of French, by whom they were made prisoners
of war.</P>
<P>The T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roleze had over-rated his own know∣ledge,
when he took upon himself the charge of
conducting our hero; for, upon their arrival at
a certain place, where two roads crossed each
other, he chanced to follow that which not only
frustrated their intention, but even led them di∣rectly
to the French camp: so that in the twi∣light
they fell in upon one of the out-guards, be∣fore
they were aware of their mistake. What∣ever
confusion and perplexity they might under∣go,
when they heard themselves questioned by
the cent<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nel on the advanced post, certain it is,
they betrayed no symptoms of fear or disorder;
but while Ferdinand endeavoured to recollect
himself, his fellow-traveller, with the appearance
<PB N="120" REF="129"/>
of admirable intrepidity and presence of mind,
told the soldier, that he and his companion were
two gentlemen of family, who had quitted the
Austrian army, on account of having sustained
some ill-usage, which they had no opportunity
of resenting in any other way; and that they
were come to offer their services to the French
general, to whose quarters they desired to be
immediately conveyed.</P>
<P>The centinel, to whom such an instance of
desertion was neither rare, nor indeed uncommon,
directed them without scruple to the next post,
where they found a serjeant's party, from which,
at their request, they were transmitted to the
officer of the grand guard, and by him, next
morning, introduced to count Coigny, who very
politely received them as volunteers in the army
of France. Though this translation was not at
all to our hero's liking, he was forced to ac∣quiesce
in his fate, glad to find himself, on these
terms, in possession of his effects, of which he
would otherwise have been infallibly rifled.</P>
<P>This campaign, however, was the most disa∣greeable
period of his whole life; because the
manner in which he had entered into the service,
subjected him to the particular observation and
notice of the French officers; so that he was ob∣liged
to be very alert in his duty, and summon
all his fortitude to maintain the character he had
assumed. What rendered his situation still more
unpalatable, was the activity of both armies in
the course of this season, during which, over
and above sundry fatiguing marches and counter-marches,
he was personally engaged in the affair
of Hallch, which was very obstinate, where
being in the skirts of the detachment, he was
<PB N="121" REF="130"/>
actually wounded in the face by the sword of an
hussar; but this was, luckily for him, the last
time he found himself under the necessity of ex∣erting
his military prowess; for a cessation of
arms was proclaimed, before he was cured of
his wound, and peace concluded about the end
of the campaign.</P>
<P>During his sojourn in the French camp, he
assumed the character of a man of family, who
being disgusted at some supercilious treatment he
had met with, in the German service, and at
the same time ambitious of carrying arms under
the banners of France, took the opportunity of
retreating by stealth from his friends, accom∣panied
only by one with whom he could en∣trust
his intention. In this capacity, he had ma∣naged
his matters to such advantage, that many
French officers of rank were very well disposed
to contribute their interest in his behalf, had his
inclination verged towards promotion in the
army; but he thought proper to conceal his
real design, under the specious pretext of longing
to see the metropolis of France, that centre of
pleasure and politeness, in which he proposed to
spend some time for the improvement of his ad∣dress
and understanding. These were motives
too laudable to be opposed by his new patrons,
some of whom furnished him with letters of
recommendation to certain noblemen of the first
rank at the court of Versailles, for which place
he and his companion set out from the banks of
the Rhine, very well satisfied with the honourable
dismission they had obtained from a life of incon∣venience,
danger and alarm.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He prepares a stratagem, but finds himself counter∣mined;
proceeds on his journey, and is overtaken
by a terrible tempest.</HEAD>
<P>IN the course of this journey, Ferdinand,
who was never deficient in his political capa∣city,
held a secret conclave with his own
thoughts, not only touching the plan of his own
future conduct, but also concerning his associate,
of whose fidelity and adherence he began to
entertain such doubts as discouraged him from
the prosecution of that design, in which the Ty∣roleze
had been at first included: for, he had
lately observed him practise the arts of his occu∣pation
among the French officers, with such ra∣pacity
and want of caution, as indicated a dan∣gerous
temerity of temper, as well as a furious
rage of acquiring, which might be sometime or
other, satiated upon his own friends. In other
words, our adventurer was afraid that his ac∣complice
would profit by his knowledge of the
road and countries through which they travelled,
and after having made free with his most valua∣ble
effects, in consequence of the familiarity
subsisting between them, leave him some
morning without the ceremony of a formal
adieu.</P>
<P>Arroused by this suspicion, he resolved to an∣ticipate
the supposed intention of the Tyroleze,
by taking his own departure in the same abrupt
manner; and this scheme he actually put in exe∣cution,
upon their arrival in Bar le duc, where
it was agreed they should spend a day to repose
<PB N="123" REF="132"/>
and refresh themselves from the fatigue of hard
riding. Ferdinand, therefore, taking the ad∣vantage
of his companion's absence, for the
Tyroleze had walked abroad to view the town,
found means to hire a peasant, who undertook
to conduct him through a bye-road, as far as
Chalons, and with this guide, he accordingly
set out on horseback, after having discharged
the bill, left a blank paper sealed up in form of a
letter, directed to his friend, and secured be∣hind
his own saddle, a pair of leathern bags in
which his jewels and cash were usually contained.
So eager was our hero to leave the Tyroleze at
a considerable distance behind, that he rode all
night at a round pace, without halting, and next
morning, found himself at a village distant thir∣teen
good leagues, from any part of the route,
which he and his companion had at first resolved
to pursue.</P>
<P>Here thinking himself safely delivered from the
cause of all his apprehension, he determined to
lie incognito for a few days, so as that he might
run no risque of an accidental meeting upon the
road, with the person whose company he had
forsaken; and accordingly he took possession of
an apartment, in which he went to rest, desir∣ing
his guide to wake him, when dinner should
be ready. Having enjoyed a very comfortable
refreshment of sleep, with his bags under his
pillow, he was summoned according to his di∣rection,
and ate a very hearty meal with great
tranquillity and internal satisfaction. In the af∣ternoon,
he amused himself with happy presages,
and ideal prospects of his future fortune, and
in the midst of these imaginary banquets was
seized with an inclination of realizing his bliss,
<PB N="124" REF="133"/>
and regaling his eye sight with the fruits of that
success, which had hitherto attended his endea∣vours.
Thus inflamed, he opened the repo∣sitory,
and O reader! what were his reflections,
when in lieu of mademoiselle Melvile's ear∣rings
and necklace, the German's golden chain,
divers jewels of considerable value, the spoils
of sundry dupes, and about two hundred ducats
in ready money, he found neither more nor less
than a parcel of rusty nails, disposed in such a
manner as to resemble in weight and bulk the
moveables he had lost.</P>
<P>It is not to be supposed, our adventurer made
this discovery without emotion. If the eternal
salvation of mankind could have been purchased
for the tenth part of his treasure, he would have
left the whole species in a state of reprobation,
rather than redeem them at that price, unless
he had seen in the bargain, some evident advan∣tage
to his own concerns: one may therefore
easily conceive with what milkiness of resignation,
he bore the loss of the whole, and saw himself
reduced from such affluence, to the necessity
of depending upon about twenty ducats, and
some loose silver which he carried in his pocket,
for his expence upon the road. However bitter
this pill might be in swallowing, he so far mas∣tered
his mortification, as to digest it with a
good grace: his own penetration at once, pointed
out the canal through which this misfortune had
flowed upon him; he forthwith placed the cala∣mity
to the account of the Tyroleze, and never
doubting that he had retired with the booty
across the Rhine, into some place to which he
knew Fathom would not follow his footsteps,
he formed the melancholy resolution of pursuing
<PB N="125" REF="134"/>
with all dispatch, his journey to Paris, that he
might with all convenient expedition, indemnify
himself for the discomfiture he had sustained.</P>
<P>With regard to his confederate, his conjecture
was perfectly right; that adventurer, though in∣finitely
inferior to our hero in point of genius
and invention, had manifestly the advantage of
him, in the articles of age and experience; he
was no stranger to Fathom's qualifications, the
happy exertion of which he had often seen. He
knew him to be an oeconomist of the most fru∣gal
order, consequently concluded his finances
were worthy of examination; and upon the true
principles of a sharper, eased him of the incum∣brance,
taking it for granted, that in so doing,
he only precluded Ferdinand from the power of
acting the same tragedy upon him, should ever
opportunity concur with his inclination. He had
therefore concerted his measures with the dexte∣rity
of an experienced conveyancer, and snatch∣ing
the occasion, while our hero travel-tainted,
lay sunk in the arms of profound repose, he ript
up the seams of the leathern depository, with∣drew
the contents, introduced the parcel of
nails, which he had made up for the purpose,
and then repaired the breach with great delibe∣ration.</P>
<P>Had Fathom's good genius prompted him to
examine his effects next morning, the Tyro∣leze,
in all probability, would have maintained
his acquisition by force of arms; for his per∣sonal
courage was rather more determined than
that of our adventurer, and he was conscious of
his own ascendancy in this particular; but, his
good fortune prevented such explanation. Imme∣diately
after dinner, he availed himself of his
<PB N="126" REF="135"/>
knowledge, and betaking himself to a remote
part of the town, set out in a post-chaise for
Luneville, while our hero was meditating his
own escape.</P>
<P>Fathom's conception was sufficient to compre∣hend
the whole of this adventure, as soon as his
chagrin would give his sagacity fair play; nor
would he allow his resolution to sink under the
trial; on the contrary, he departed from the
village, that same afternoon, under the auspices
of his conductor, and found himself benighted
in the midst of a forest far from the habitations
of men; the darkness of the night, the silence
and solitude of the place, the indistinct images
of the trees that appeared on every side, “stretch∣ing
their extravagant arms athwart the gloom,”
conspired with the dejection of spirits occasioned
by his loss to disturb his fancy, and raise strange
phantoms in his imagination. Although he was
not naturally superstitious, his mind began to
be invaded with an awful horror, that gradually
prevailed over all the consolations of reason and
philosophy; nor was his heart free from the
terrors of assassination. In order to dissipate these
disagreeable reveries, he had recourse to the con∣versation
of his guide, by whom he was enter∣tained
with the history of divers travellers, who
had been robbed and murdered by ruffians,
whose retreat was in the recesses of that very
wood.</P>
<P>In the midst of this communication, which
did not at all tend to the elevation of our
hero's spirits, the conductor made an excuse for
dropping behind, while our traveller jogged on
in expectation of being joined again by him in a
few minutes: he was however disappointed in
<PB N="127" REF="136"/>
that hope: the sound of the other horse's feet,
by degrees, grew more and more faint, and at
last, altogether died away. Alarmed at this cir∣cumstance,
Fathom halted in the middle of the
road, and listened with the most fearful atten∣tion;
but his sense of hearing was saluted with
nought but the dismal sighings of the trees, that
seemed to foretell an approaching storm; accord∣ingly
the Heavens contracted a more dreary as∣pect,
the lightning began to gleam, the thunder
to roll, and the tempest raising its voice to
a tremendous roar, descended in a torrent of
rain.</P>
<P>In this emergency, the fortitude of our hero
was almost quite overcome; so many concur∣ing
circumstances of danger and distress, might
have appalled the most undaunted breast; what
impression then must they have made upon the
mind of Ferdinand, who was by no means a
man to set fear at defiance! indeed, he had well
nigh lost the use of his reflection, and was actu∣ally
invaded to the skin, before he could recol∣lect
himself so far as to quit the road, and seek
for shelter among the thickets that surrounded
them. Having rode some furlongs into the fo∣rest,
he took his station under a tuft of tall trees,
that screened him from the storm, and in that
situation called a council within himself, to de∣liberate
upon his next excursion. He persuaded
himself that his guide had deserted him for the
present, in order to give intelligence of a travel∣ler,
to some gang of robbers with whom he was
connected; and that he must of necessity fall a
prey to those banditti, unless he should have the
good fortune to elude their search, and disentan∣gle
himself from the mazes of the wood.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="137"/>
Harrowed with these apprehensions, he resolv∣ed
to commit himself to the mercy of the hur∣ricane,
as of two evils the least, and penetrate
streight forwards through some devious opening,
until he should be delivered from the forest. For
this purpose, he turned his horse's head in a line,
quite contrary to the direction of the high-road
which he had left, on the supposition, that the
robbers would pursue that tract in quest of him,
and that they would never dream of his desert∣ing
the highway, to traverse an unknown for∣rest,
amidst the darkness of such a boisterous
night. After he had continued in this progress, thro'
a succession of groves, and bogs, and thorns and
brakes, by which, not only his cloaths, but
also his skin suffered in a grievous manner, while
every nerve quivered with eagerness of dismay;
he at length reached an open plain, and pursu∣ing
his course, in full hope of arriving at some
village, where his life would be safe, he descried
a rush light at a distance, which he looked upon
as the star of his good fortune, and riding to∣wards
it at full speed, arrived at the door of a
lone cottage, into which he was admitted by an
old woman, who understanding he was a be∣wildered
traveller, received him with great hos∣pitality.</P>
<P>When he learned from his hostess, that there
was not another house within three leagues, that
she could accommodate him with a tolerable
bed, and his horse with lodging and oats, he
thanked Heaven for his good fortune in stum∣bling
upon this homely habitation, and deter∣mined
to pass the night under the protection of
the old cottager, who gave him to understand
that her husband, who was a faggot-maker, had
<PB N="129" REF="138"/>
gone to the next town to dispose of his merchan∣dize,
and that in all probability, he would not
return till next morning, on account of the
tempestuous night. Ferdinand sounded the bel∣dame
with a thousand artful interrogations, and
she answered with such appearance of truth and
simplicity, that he concluded his person was
quite secure; and after having been regaled with
a dish of eggs and bacon, desired she would
conduct him into the chamber where she propo∣sed
he should take his repose. He was accord∣ingly
ushered up by a sort of ladder, into an apart∣ment
furnished with a standing-bed, and almost
half filled with trusses of straw. He seemed
extremely well pleased with his lodging, which
in reality exceeded his expectation, and his kind
landlady cautioning him against letting the can∣dle
approach the combustibles, took her leave,
and locked the door on the outside.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">He falls upon Scylla, seeking to avoid Charybdis.</HEAD>
<P>FAthom, whose own principles taught him
to be suspicious, and ever upon his guard
against the treachery of his fellow creatures,
could have dispensed with this instance of her
care in confining her guest to her chamber, and
began to be seized with strange fancies, when
he observed that there was no bolt on the inside
of the door, by which he might secure himself
from intrusion. In consequence of these sugges∣tions,
he proposed to take an accurate survey of
every object in the apartment, and in the course
of his inquiry, had the mortification to find the
<PB N="130" REF="139"/>
dead body of a man, still warm, who had been
lately stabbed, and concealed beneath several bun∣dles
of straw.</P>
<P>Such a discovery could not fail to fill the breast
of our hero, with unspeakable horror; for he
concluded that he himself would undergo the
same fate before morning, without the interpo∣sition
of a miracle in his favour. In the first
transports of his dread, he ran to the window
with a view to escape by that outlet, and found
his flight effectually obstructed by divers strong
bars of iron. Then his heart began to palpi∣tate,
his hair to bristle up, and his knees to tot∣ter;
his thoughts teemed with presages of death
and destruction; his conscience rose up in judg∣ment
against him, and he underwent a severe
paroxysm of dismay and distraction. His spirits
were agitated into a state of fermentation that
produced a species of resolution a-kin to that
which is inspired by brandy or other strong
liquors, and by an impulse that seemed superna∣tural,
he was immediately hurried into mea∣sures
for his own preservation.</P>
<P>What upon a less interesting occasion his ima∣gination
durst not propose, he now executed
without scruple or remorse: he undressed the
corpse that lay bleeding among the straw, and
conveying it to the bed in his arms, deposited
it in the attitude of a person who sleeps at his
ease; then he extinguished the light, took pos∣session
of the place from whence the body had
been removed, and holding a pistol ready cocked
in each hand, waited for the sequel with that
determined purpose, which is often the imme∣diate
production of despair. About midnight
he heard the sound of feet ascending the ladder,
<PB N="131" REF="140"/>
the door was softly opened, he saw the shadow
of two men stalking towards the bed, a dark
lanthorn being unshrouded, directed their aim
to the supposed sleeper, and he that held it, thrust
a poignard to his heart; the force of the blow
made a compression on the chest, and a sort of
groan issued from the windpipe of the defunct;
the stroke was repeated, without producing a
repetition of the note, so that the assassins con∣cluded
the work was effectually done, and retired
for the present, with a design to return and rifle
the deceased at their leisure.</P>
<P>Never had our hero spent a moment in such
agony, as he felt during this operation; the
whole surface of his body was covered with a
cold sweat, and his nerves were relaxed with
an universal palsy: in short, he remained in a
trance that, in all probability, contributed to his
safety; for, had he retained the use of his senses,
he might have been discovered by the transports
of his fear. The first use he made of his re∣trieved
recollection was to perceive that the assas∣sins
had left the door open in their retreat; and
he would have instantly availed himself of this
their neglect, by sallying out upon them, at the
hazard of his life, had not he been restrained
by a conversation he overheard in the room
below, importing that the ruffians were going
to set out upon another expedition, in hopes of
finding more prey: they accordingly departed,
after having laid strong injunctions upon the old
woman, to keep the door fast locked during
their absence; and Ferdinand took his resolu∣tion
without farther delay. So soon as by his
conjecture, the robbers were at a sufficient dis∣tance
from the house, he rose from his lurking∣place,
<PB N="132" REF="141"/>
moved softly towards the bed, and rum∣maging
the pockets of the deceased, found a
purse well stored with ducats, of which, toge∣ther
with a silver watch and a diamond ring, he
immediately possessed himself without scruple;
then descending with great care and circumspec∣tion,
into the lower apartment, stood before the
old beldam, before she had the least intimation
of his approach.</P>
<P>Accustomed as she was to the trade of blood,
the hoary hag did not behold this apparition
without giving signs of infinite terror and
astonishment, believing it was no other than the
spirit of her second guest who had been mur∣dered;
she fell upon her knees, and began to re∣commend
herself to the protection of the saints,
crossing herself with as much devotion, as if
she had been intitled to the particular care
and attention of Heaven. Nor did her anxiety
abate, when she was undeceived in this her sup∣position,
and understood it was no phantom,
but the real substance of the stranger, who
without staying to upbraid her with the enormity
of her crimes, commanded her on pain of im∣mediate
death to produce his horse, to which
being conducted, he set her upon the saddle
without delay, and mounting behind, invested
her with the management of the reins, swear∣ing
in a most peremptory tone, that the only
chance she had for her life, was in directing
him safely to the next town; and that so soon
as she should give him the least cause to doubt
her fidelity in the performance of that task,
he would, on the instant, act the part of her
executioner.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="142"/>
This declaration had its effect upon the wi∣thered
Hecate, who, with many supplications
for mercy and forgiveness, promised to guide him
in safety, to a certain village at the distance of
two leagues, where he might lodge in security,
and be provided with a fresh horse, or other
convenience, for pursuing his intended route.
On these conditions, he told her, she might de∣serve
his clemency, and they accordingly took
their departure together, she being placed astride
upon the saddle, holding the bridle in one hand,
and a switch in the other; and our adventurer
sitting on the crupper, superintending her con∣duct,
and keeping the muzzle of a pistol close
at her ear. In this equipage, they travelled across
part of the same wood, in which his guide had
forsaken him; and it is not be supposed, that he
passed his time in the most agreeable reverie,
while he found himself involved in the labyrinth
of those shades, which he considered as the
haunts of robbery and assassination.</P>
<P>Common fear was a comfortable sensation to
what he felt in this excursion. The first steps he
had taken for his preservation, were the effects
of meer instinct, while his faculties were ex∣tinguished
or suppressed by despair; but, now as
his reflection began to recur, he was haunted by
the most intolerable apprehensions. Every whis∣per
of the wind through the thickets, was swell∣ed
into the hoarse menaces of murder, the shak∣ing
of the boughs was construed into the bran∣dishing
of poignards, and every shadow of a
tree, became the apparition of a ruffian eager
for blood. In short, at each of these occurrences,
he felt what was infinitely more tormenting
than the stab of a real dagger; and at every
<PB N="134" REF="143"/>
fresh silip of his fear, he acted as remembrancer
to his conductress, in a new volley of impreca∣tions,
importing that her life was absolutely con∣nected
with his opinion of his own safety.</P>
<P>Human nature could not long subsist under
such complicated terror: at last he found him∣self
clear of the forest, and was blessed with
the distant view of an inhabited place: he then
began to exercise his thoughts upon a new sub∣ject.
He debated with himself, whether he
should make a parade of his intrepidity and pub∣lic
spirit, by disclosing his atchievement and sur∣rendring
his guide to the penalty of the law; or
leave the old hag and her accomplices to the re∣morse
of their own consciences, and proceed
quietly on his journey to Paris, in undisturbed
possession of the prize he had already obtained.
This last step he determined to take, upon re∣collecting
that in the course of his information,
the story of the murdered stranger would infal∣libly
attract the attention of justice, and in that
case, the effects he had borrowed from the de∣funct,
must be refunded for the benefit of those
who had a right to the succession. This was an
argument which our adventurer could not resist;
he foresaw that he should be stript of his acqui∣sition,
which he looked upon as the fair fruits of
his valour and sagacity; and moreover, be de∣tained
as an evidence against the robbers, to the
manifest detriment of his affairs: perhaps too,
he had motives of conscience that dissuaded
him from bearing witness against a set of people,
whose principles did not much differ from his
own.</P>
<P>Influenced by such considerations, he yielded
to the first importunity of the beldam, whom
<PB N="135" REF="144"/>
he dismissed at a very small distance from the vil∣lage,
after he had earnestly exhorted her to quit
such an atrocious course of life, and attone for
her past crimes, by sacrificing her associates to
the demands of justice. She did not fail to vow
a perfect reformation, and to prostrate herself
before him, for the favour she had found; then
she betook herself to her habitation, with full
purpose of advising her fellow-murderers to re∣pair
with all dispatch to the village, and impeach
our hero, who wisely distrusting her professions,
staid no longer in the place, than to hire a guide
for the next stage, which brought him to the
city of Chalons sur Marne.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">He arrives at Paris, and is pleased with his re∣ception.</HEAD>
<P>HE was not so smitten with the delightful
situation of this ancient town, but that he
abandoned it as soon as he could procure a post∣chaise,
in which he arrived at Paris, without
having been exposed to any other troublesome
adventure upon the road. He took lodgings at
a certain hotel in the Fauxbourg de St. Germain,
which is the general rendezvous of all the
strangers that resort to this capital; and
now sincerely congratulated himself upon his
happy escape from his Hungarian connections,
and from the snares of the banditti; as well as
upon the spoils of the dead body, and his arrival
at Paris, from whence there was such a short
conveyance to England, whither he was attracted
<PB N="136" REF="145"/>
by far other motives than that of filial venera∣tion
for his native soil.</P>
<P>He suppressed all his letters of recommenda∣tion,
which he justly concluded, would subject
him to a tedious course of attendance upon the
great, and lay him under the necessity of sollicit∣ing
preferment in the army, than which nothing
was farther from his inclination; and resolved
to make his appearance in the character of a
private gentleman, which would supply him with
opportunities of examining the different scenes
of life in such a gay metropolis, so as that he
should be able to chuse that sphere in which he
could move the most effectually to his own ad∣vantage.
He accordingly hired an occasional
domestick, and under the denomination of count
Fadome, which he had retained since his elope∣ment
from Renaldo, repaired to dinner at an
ordinary, to which he was directed as a re∣putable
place frequented by fashionable strangers
of all nations.</P>
<P>He found this piece of information perfectly
just; for he no sooner entered the apartment,
than his ears were saluted with a strange confu∣sion
of sounds, among which he at once di∣stinguished
the high and low Dutch, barbarous
French, Italian and English languages. He was
rejoiced at this occasion of displaying his own
qualifications; took his place at one of three
long tables, betwixt a Westphalian count, and a
Bolognian marquis, insinuated himself into the
conversation with his usual address, and in less
than half an hour, found means to accost a na∣tive
of each different country, in his own mo∣ther
tongue.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="146"/>
Such extensive knowledge did not pass unob∣served.
A French abbé, in a provincial dialect,
complimented him upon his retaining that pu∣rity
in pronunciation, which is not to be found
in the speech of a Parisian. The Bolognian
mistaking him for a Tuscan, “Sir, said he, I
presume you are from Florence: I hope the il∣lustrious
house of Lorrain leaves you gentlemen
of that famous city, no room to regret the loss
of your own princes.” The castle of Versailles
becoming the subject of conversation, monsieur
le Comte appealed to him as to a native German,
whether it was not inferior in point of magni∣ficence
to the Chateau of Grubenhagen: the
Dutch officer addressing himself to Fathom,
drank to the prosperity of Faderland, and
asked if he had not once served in garrison at
Schenkenschans; and an English knight swore
with great assurance, that he had frequently
rambled with him at midnight, among the hun∣dreds
of Drury.</P>
<P>To each person he replied in a polite, tho'
mysterious manner, which did not fail to inhance
their opinion of his good breeding and import∣ance;
and long before the desert appeared, he
was by all the company supposed to be a perso∣nage
of great consequence, who for some sub∣stantial
reasons, found it convenient to keep him∣self
incognito. This being the case, it is not
to be doubted that particular civilities were
poured upon him from all quarters: he perceived
their sentiments, and encouraged them, by be∣having
with that sort of complaisance which
seems to be the result of engaging condescen∣sion
in a character of superior dignity and sta∣tion.
His affability was general; but his chief
<PB N="138" REF="147"/>
attention limited to those gentlemen already men∣tioned,
who chanced to sit nearest him at table;
and he no sooner gave them to understand that he
was an utter stranger in Paris, than they una∣nimously
begged to have the honour of making
him acquainted with the different curiosities pe∣culiar
to that metropolis.</P>
<P>He accepted of their hospitality, accom∣panied
them to a coffee-house in the after∣noon,
from whence they repaired to the opera, and
afterwards adjourned to a noted hotel, in order to
spend the remaining part of the evening. It
was here that our hero secured himself effectually
in the footing he had gained in their good graces:
he in a moment saw through all the characters
of the partie, and adapted himself to the humour
of each individual; without descending from
that elevation of behaviour, which, he perceived,
would operate among them in his behalf. With
the Italian he discoursed on musick, in the stile
of a connoisseur; and indeed had a better claim
to that title than the generality of those upon
whom it is usually conferred; for he understood
the art in theory as well as in practice, and
would have made no contemptible figure among
the best performers of the age.</P>
<P>He harangued upon taste and genius, to the
abbé, who was a wit and critic, ex officio, or
rather ex vestitu: for, a young pert Frenchman,
the very moment he puts on the petit collet, or
little band, looks upon himself as an inspired son
of Apollo; and every one of the fraternity
thinks it incumbent upon him to assert the divi∣nity
of his mission: in a word, the abbés are a
set of people, that bear a strong analogy to the
templars in London. Fools of each fabric,
<PB N="139" REF="148"/>
sharpers of all sorts, and dunces of every degree,
profess themselves of both orders: the templar
is, generally speaking a prig, so is the abbé:
both are distinguished by an air of petulance and
self-conceit, which holds a middle rank betwixt
the insolence of a first rate buck, and the learn∣ed
pride of a supercilious pedant. The abbé
is supposed to be a younger brother in quest of
preferment in the church: the temple is consi∣dered
as a receptacle or seminary for younger
sons, intended for the bar; but a great number
of each profession turn aside into other paths of
life, long before they reach these proposed
goals: an abbé is often metamorphosed into a
foot-soldier; a templar sometimes sinks into an
attorney's clerk: the gallies of France abound
with abbés; and many templars may be found
in our American plantations; not to mention
those who have made a public exit nearer home.
Yet, I would not have it thought that my de∣scription
includes every individual of those socie∣ties.
Some of the greatest scholars, politicians,
and wits that ever Europe produced, have wore
the habit of an abbé; and many of our most
noble families in England derive their honours
from those who have studied law in the temple:
the worthy sons of every community shall al∣ways
be sacred from my censure and ridicule;
and while I laugh at the folly of particular mem∣bers,
I can still honour and revere the insti∣tution.</P>
<P>But, let us return from this comparison, which
some readers may think impertinent and unsea∣sonable;
and observe that the Westphalian count,
Dutch officer, and English knight, were not
excepted from the particular regard and atten∣tion
<PB N="140" REF="149"/>
of our adventurer: he pledged the German
in every bumper; flattered the Hollander with
complements upon the industry, wealth and po∣licy
of the seven United Provinces; but he re∣served
his chief battery for his own countryman,
on the supposition that he was, in all respects, the
best adapted for the purposes of a needy game∣fter:
him, therefore, he cultivated with extra∣ordinary
care, and singular observance; for he
soon perceived him to be an humourist, and from
that circumstance derived an happy presage of
his own success. The baronet's disposition seem∣ed
to be cast in the true English mould. He
was sour, silent and contemptuous; his very
looks indicated a consciousness of superior wealth,
and he never opened his mouth, except to make
some dry, sarcastic, national reflection: nor
was his behaviour free from that air of suspicion
which a man puts on, when he believes himself
in a croud of pickpockets whom his caution and
vigilance set at desiance: in a word, though his
tongue was silent on the subject, his whole de∣meanour
was continually saying, “You are all
a pack of poor, lousy rascals, who have a de∣sign
upon my purse: 'tis true, I could buy your
whole generation; but, I wont be bubbled, d'ye
see; I am aware of your flattery, and upon
my guard against all your knavish pranks;
and I come into your company, for my own
amusement only.”</P>
<P>Fathom having reconnoitred this peculiarity
of temper, instead of treating him with that assi∣duous
complaisance, which he received from the
other gentlemen of the party, kept aloof from
him in the conversation, with a remarkable shy∣ness
of distant civility, and seldom took notice
<PB N="141" REF="150"/>
of what he said, except with a view to contra∣dict
him, or retort some of his satyrical obser∣vations.
This he conceived to be the best me∣thod
of acquiring his good opinion; because the
Englishman would naturally conclude he was a
person who could have no sinister views upon his
fortune, else he would have chosen quite a dif∣ferent
manner of deportment. Accordingly,
the knight seemed to bite at the hook: he listen∣ed
to Ferdinand with uncommon regard; he
was even heard to commend his remarks; and
at length drank to their better acquaintance.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Acquits himself with address in a nocturnal riot.</HEAD>
<P>THE Italian and the Abbé were the first
who began to grow whimsical under the
influence of the Burgundy; and in the heat of
their elevation, proposed that the company should
amuse themselves during the remaining part of
the night, at the house of an obliging dame,
who maintained a troop of fair nymphs, for the
accommodation of the other sex. The propo∣sal
was approved by all, except the Hollander,
whose oeconomy the wine had not as yet invad∣ed;
and while he retreated soberly to his own
lodgings, the rest of the society adjourned in
two coaches, to the temple of love, where they
were received by the venerable priestess, a per∣sonage
turned of seventy, who seemed to exer∣cise
the functions of her calling, in despight of
the most cruel ravages of time: for age had
bent her into the form of a Turkish bow: her
head was agitated by the palsy, like the leaf of
<PB N="142" REF="151"/>
the poplar-tree, her hair fell down in scanty par∣cels,
as white as the driven snow: her face was
not simply wrinkled, but ploughed into innume∣rable
furrows: her jaws could not boast of one
remaining tooth; one eye distilled a large quan∣tity
of rheum, by virtue of the fiery edge that
surrounded it, the other was altogether extin∣guished,
and she had lost her nose in the course
of her ministration. The Delphic sibyl was but
a type of this hoary matron, who by her figure
might have been mistaken for the consort of chaos,
or mother of time. Yet there was something
meritorous in her appearance, as it denoted her
an indefatigable minister to the pleasure of man∣kind;
and as it formed an agreeable contrast
with the beauty and youth of the fair damsels
that wantoned in her train. It resembled those
discords in musick, which properly disposed,
contribute to the harmony of the whole piece:
or those horrible giants who in the world of ro∣mance,
used to guard the gates of the castle, in
which the inchanted damsel was confined.</P>
<P>This Urganda seemed to be aware of her own
importance, and perfectly well acquainted with
the human appetite; for she compelled the
whole company to undergo her embrace; then a
lacquey in magnificent livery, ushered them into
a superb apartment, where they waited some mi∣nutes,
without being favoured with the appear∣ance
of the ladies, to the manifest dissatisfaction
of the abbé, who sending for the gouvernante,
reprimanded her severely for her want of poli∣tesse.
The old lady, who was by no means a
patern of patience and submission, retorted his
reproaches with great emphasis and vivacity:
her eloquence flowed altogether in the Covent∣garden
<PB N="143" REF="152"/>
strain; and I question whether the cele∣brated
mother D—gl—s herself could have made
such a figure in extemporaneous altercation.</P>
<P>After having bestowed upon the abbé the epi∣thets
of saucy insignificant pimp, she put him in
mind of the good offices which he had received
at her hands; how she had supplied him with
bed, board, and bedfellow, in his greatest
necessity; sent him abroad with money in his
pockets, and in a word, cherished him in her
bosom, when his own mother had abandoned
him to distress: she then reviled him for pre∣suming
to affront her before strangers, and gave
the company to understand that the young ladies
would wait upon them, as soon as they could
be confessed and receive absolution from a wor∣thy
cordelier, who was now employed in per∣forming
that charitable office. The gentlemen
were satisfied with this remonstrance, which ar∣gued
the old lady's pious concern for the souls
that were under her care, and our adventurer
proposed an accommodation betwixt her and the
abbé, who was prevailed upon to ask her pardon,
and received her blessing upon his knees.</P>
<P>This affair had not been long adjusted, when
five damsels were introduced in a very gay disha∣bille,
and our hero was complimented with the
privilege of chusing his Amanda from the whole
bevy: when he was provided, the others began
to pair themselves, and unhappily, the German
count chanced to pitch upon the same nymph
who had captivated the desires of the British
knight: a dispute immediately ensued, for the
Englishman made his addresses to the lady,
without paying the least regard to the priority
of the other's claim; and she being pleased with
<PB N="144" REF="153"/>
his attachment, did not scruple to renounce his
rival, who swore by the thunder, lightning and
sacrament, that he would not quit his preten∣sions
for any prince in Christendom, much less
for a little English chevalier, whom he had al∣ready
honoured too much in condescending to
be his companion.</P>
<P>The knight, provoked at this stately declara∣tion,
which was the immediate effect of anger
and ebriety, eyed his antagonist with a most
contemptuous aspect, and advised him to avoid
such comparisons for the future: “We all know,
said he, the importance of a German count;
I suppose your revenue amounts to three hundred
rixdollars; and you have a chateau that looks
like the ruins of an English gaol. I will bind
myself to lend you a thousand pounds upon a
mortgage of your estate (and a bad bargain I am
sure I should have:) if I do not in less than two
months, find a yeoman of Kent, who spends
more in strong ale, than the sum total of your
yearly income; and were the truth known, I be∣lieve
that lace upon your coat, is no better than
tinsel, and those fringed ruffles with fine Holland
sleeves, tacked to a shirt of brown canvas, so
that were you to undress yourself before the lady,
you would only expose your own poverty and
pride.”</P>
<P>The count was so much enraged at these sar∣castic
observations, that his faculty of speech
was overwhelmed by his resentment; though
in order to acquit himself of the English∣man's
imputation, he forthwith pulled off his
cloaths with such fury, that his brocard waist∣coat
was tore from top to bottom. The knight
mistaking his meaning, considered this demeanour
<PB N="145" REF="154"/>
as a fair challenge, to try which was the better
man in the exercise of boxing; and on that sup∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tion,
began to strip in his turn, when he
was undeceived by Fathom, who put the right
interpretation upon the count's behaviour, and
begged that the affair might be compromised.
By this time the Westphalian recovered the use
of his tongue, and with many threats and impre∣cations,
desired they would take notice how
falsly he had been aspersed, and do him justice
in espousing his claim to the damsel in ques∣tion.</P>
<P>Before the company had time or inclination
to interest themselves in the quarrel, his oppo∣nent
observed that no person who was not a meer
German, would ever dream of forcing the in∣clinations
of a pretty girl, whom the accidents
of fortune had subjected to his power: that such
compulsion was equivalent to the most cruel rape
that could be committed; and that the lady's
aversion was not at all surprising; for, to speak
his own sentiments, were he a woman of plea∣sure,
he would as soon grant favours to a West∣phalian
hog, as to the person of his antagonist.
The German enraged at this comparison, was
quite abandoned by his patience and discretion:
he called the knight an English clown, and
swearing he was the most untoward beast of a
whole nation of mules, snatched up one of the
candlesticks which he launched at him with
such force and violence, that it sung through the
air, and winging its flight into the anti-chamber,
encountered the skull of his own valet, who
with immediate prostration received the message
of his master.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="155"/>
The knight, that he might not be behind
hand with the Westphalian, in point of court<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sy,
returned the compliment with the remaining
chandelier, which also missed its mark, and
smiting a large mirrour that was fixed behind
them, emitted such a crash as one might expect
to hear if a mine were sprung beneath a manu∣facture
of glass. Both lights being thus extin∣guished,
a surious combat ensued in the dark;
the Italian scampered off with infinite agility,
and as he went down stairs, desired that nobody
would interpose, because it was an affair of ho∣nour,
which could not be made up. The ladies
consulted their fafety in flight; count Fathom
slily retired to one corner of the room, while the
abbé having upon him the terrors of the commis∣saire,
endeavoured to appease and part the com∣batants,
and in the attempt, sustained a random
blow upon his nose, which sent him howling
into the other chamber, where finding his band
besmea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed with his own blood, he began to
caper about the apartment, in a transport of rage
and vexation.</P>
<P>Mean while, the old gentlewoman being
alarmed with the noise of the battle, and ap∣prehensive
that it would end in murder, to the
danger and discredit of herself and family, im∣mediately
mustered up her myrmidons, of whom
she always retained a formidable band, and put∣ing
herself at their head, lighted them to the
scene of uproar: Ferdinand, who had hitherto
observed a strict neutrality, no sooner perceived
them approach, than he leaped in between the
disputants, that he might be sound acting in the
character of a peace-maker; and indeed, by this
time, victory had declared for the baronet, who
had treated his antagonist with a cross-buttock,
<PB N="147" REF="156"/>
which laid him almost breathless on the floor.
The victor was prevailed upon, by the intreaties
of Fathom, to quit the field of battle, and ad∣journ
into another room, where in less than half
an hour, he received a billet from the count,
defying him to single combat on the frontiers
of Flanders, at an appointed time and place.
The challenge was immediately accepted by the
knight, who being flushed with conquest, treat∣ed
his adversary with great contempt.</P>
<P>But, next day, when the fumes of the Bur∣gundy
were quite exhaled, and the adventure
recurred to his remembrance and sober reflection,
he waited upon our adventurer at his lodgings,
and sollicited his advice in such a manner, as
gave him to understand that he looked upon
what had happened, as a drunken brawl, which
ought to have no serious consequences. Fathom
foreseeing that the affair might be managed for
his own interest, professed himself of the baro∣net's
opinion; and without hesitation, under∣took
the office of a mediator, assuring his prin∣cipal,
that his honour should suffer no stain in
the course of his negotiation.</P>
<P>Having received the Englishman's acknow∣ledgments
for this instance of friendship, he
forthwith set out for the place of the Ger∣man's
habitation, and understanding he was still
asleep, insisted upon his being immediately
waked, and told, that a gentleman from the che∣valier,
desired to see him, upon business of im∣portance
which could not be delayed. Accord∣ingly,
his valet de chambre pressed by Fathom's
importunities and remonstrances, ventured to go
in and shake the count by the shoulder, when
this furious Teutonian, still agitated by the fever
<PB N="148" REF="157"/>
of the preceding night, leaped out of bed in a
frenzy, and seizing his sword that lay upon a ta∣ble,
would have severely punished the presump∣tion
of his servant, had not he been restrained
by the entrance of Ferdinand, who with a pe∣remptory
countenance, gave him to understand
that the valet had acted at his immediate instiga∣tion;
and that he was come, as the Englishman's
friend, to concert with him proper measures for
keeping the appointment they had made at their
last meeting.</P>
<P>This message effectually calmed the German,
who was not a little mortified to find himself so
disagreeably disturbed. He could not help curs∣ing
the impatience of his antagonist, and even
hinting that he would have acted more like a
gentleman and good christian, in expressing a
desire of seeing the affair accommodated, as he
knew himself to be the aggressor, consequently
the first offender against the laws of politeness
and good fellowship. Fathom finding him in a
fit temper of mind, took the opportunity of as∣senting
to the reasonableness of his observation:
he ventured to condemn the impetuosity of the
baronet, who, he perceived, was extremely
nice and scrupulous in the punctilios of honour;
and said it was pity that two gentlemen should
forfeit each other's friendship, much less expose
their lives for such a frivolous cause. “My dear
count! cried the Westphalian, I am charmed
to find your sentiments so conformable to my
own: in an honourable cause, I despise all dan∣ger;
my courage, thank Heaven! has been
manifested in many public engagements as well
as in private rencounters; but, to break with
my friend, whose eminent virtues I admire, and
<PB N="149" REF="158"/>
even to seek his life, on such a scandalous occa∣sion,
for a little insignificant whore, who, I sup∣pose,
took the advantage of our intoxication, to
foment the quarrel: by Heaven! my conscience
cannot digest it.”</P>
<P>Having expressed himself to this purpose, he
waited impatiently for the reply of Ferdinand,
who after a pause of deliberation, offered his
services in the way of mediation; though he ob∣served,
it was a matter of great delicacy,
and the event altogether uncertain. “Never∣theless,”
added our adventurer, “I will strive
to appease the knight, who, I hope will be in∣duced
by my remonstrances to forget the unlucky
accident, which hath so disagreeably interrupted
your mutual friendship.” The German thanked
him for this proof of his regard, which yielded
him more satisfaction on account of the cheva∣lier
than of himself: “For, by the tombs of
my fathers!” cried he, “I have so little concern
for my personal safety, that if my honour were
interested, I durst oppose myself singly to the
whole ban of the empire; and I am now ready,
if the chevalier requires it, to give him the ren∣dezvous
in the forest of Senlis, either on horse∣back
or on foot, where this contest may be ter∣minated
with the life of one or both of us.”</P>
<P>Count Fathom, with a view to chastise the
Westphalian for this rhodomontade, told him
with a mortifying air of indifference, that if they
were both bent upon taking the field, he would
save himself the trouble of interposing farther in
the affair; and desired to know the hour at
which it would suit him to take the air with the
baronet: the other, not a little embarrassed by
this question, said with a faultering tongue, he
<PB N="150" REF="159"/>
should be proud to obey the chevalier's orders;
but, at the same time, owned he should be much
better pleased, if our hero would execute the
pacific proposal he had made. Fathom, accord∣ingly
promised to exert himself for that purpose,
returned to the knight, with whom he assumed
the merit of having tranquillized the rage of an
incensed barbarian, who was now disposed to a
reconciliation upon equal terms: the baronet
overwhelmed him with caresses and compliments
upon his friendship and address; the parties met
that same forenoon, as if by accident in Fathom's
apartment, where they embraced each other
cordially, exchanged apologies, and renewed
their former correspondence.</P>
<P>Our adventurer thought he had good reason
to congratulate himself upon the part he acted
in this pacification: he was treated by both with
signal marks of particular affection and esteem.
The count pressed him to accept as a token of his
attachment, a sword of very curious workman∣ship,
which he had received in a present from a
certain prince of the empire: the knight forced
upon his finger a very splendid diamond ring, as a
testimony of his gratitude and esteem: but there
was still another person to be appeased, before
the peace of the whole company could be esta∣blished.
This was no other than the abbé, from
whom each of the reconciled friends received
at dinner a billet couched in these words.</P>
<P>“I have the honour to lament the infinite
chagrin and mortification that compels me
to address myself in this manner to a per∣son
of your rank and eminence, whom I
should do myself the pleasure of waiting upon
<PB N="151" REF="160"/>
in person; were I not prevented by the mis∣fortune
of my nose, which was last night most
cruelly disar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ged, by a violent contusion I
had the honour to receive, in attempting to
compose that unhappy <HI>fracas,</HI> at the house of
madam la Maquerelle; and what puts the
finishing stroke to my mishap, is my being
rendered incapable of keeping three or four
assignations with ladies of fashion, by whom I
have the honour to be particularly esteemed.
The disfiguration of my nose, the pain I have
undergone, with the discomposure of brain
which it produced, I could bear as a philoso∣pher;
but the disappointment of the ladies, my
glory will not permit me to overlook: and as
you know the injury was sustained in your ser∣vice,
I have the pleasure to hope you will not
refuse to grant such reparation as will be ac∣ceptable
to a gentleman who has the honour to
be with inviolable attachment,</P>
<Q>“Sir your most devoted slave,
Pepin Clothaire Charlé Henri Louis Bar∣nabe
de Eumier.”</Q>
<P>This epistle was so equivocal, that the per∣sons
to whom it was addressed, did not know
whether or not they ought to interpret the con∣tents
into a challenge; when our hero observed,
that the ambiguity of his expressions, plainly
proved there was a door left open for accom∣modation;
and proposed that they should forth∣with
visit the writer at his own apartment: they
accordingly followed his advice, and found the
abbé in his morning-gown and slippers, with
three huge night-caps on his head, and a crape
<PB N="152" REF="161"/>
hat-band tied over the middle of his face, by
way of bandage to his nose. He received his
visiters with the most ridiculous solemnity, be∣ing
still a stranger to the purport of their errand;
but soon as the Westphalian declared they were
come in consequence of his billet, in order to
ask pardon for the undesigned offence they had
given, his features retrieved their natural viva∣city,
and he professed himself perfectly satisfied
with their polite acknowledgment. Then they
condoled him upon the evil plight of his nose,
and seeing some marks upon his shirt, asked with
seeming concern, if he had lost any blood in the
fray. To this interrogation, he replied, that he
had still a sufficient quantity left for the occasions
of his friends; and that he should deem it his
greatest glory, to expend the last drop of it in
their service.</P>
<P>Matters being thus amicably adjusted, they
prevailed upon him to uncase his nose, which
retained no signs of the outrage he had suffered;
and the amusements of the day were concerted.
It was in consequence of this plan, that after the
comedy, they were entertained at the count's
lodgings, where quadrille was proposed by the
abbé, as the most innocent pastime, and the
proposal was immediately embraced by all pre∣sent,
and by none with more alacrity than by
our adventurer, who without putting forth a
moiety of his terror, went home with twenty
louis' clear gain: though, far from believing
himself greatly superior to the rest of the party,
in the artifices of play, he justly suspected that
they had concealed their skill, with a view of
stripping him on some other occasion; for he
could not suppose, that persons of their figure
<PB N="153" REF="162"/>
and character, should be, in reality, such novices
as they affected to appear.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="24" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He overlooks the advances of his friends, and
smarts severely for his neglect.</HEAD>
<P>STeeled with this cautious maxim he guarded
himself from their united endeavours, in
sundry subsequent attacks, by which his first con∣jecture
was confirmed, and still came off con∣queror,
by virtue of his unparallelled finesse and
discretion: till at length they seemed to despair
of making him their prey, and the count began
to drop some hints, importing a desire of seeing
him more closely united to the views and interest
of their triumvirate. But Ferdinand, who was
altogether selfish, and quite solitary in his pros∣pects,
discouraged all those advances; being re∣solved
to trade upon his own bottom only, and
to avoid all such connexions with any person or
society whatever; much more, with a set of
raw adventurers whose talents he despised. With
these sentiments, he still maintained the dignity
and reserve of his first appearance among them,
and rather inhanced than diminished that idea of
importance which he had inspired at the begin∣ning;
because besides his other qualifica∣tions,
they gave him credit for the address with
which he kept himself superior to their united
designs.</P>
<P>While he thus enjoyed his pre-heminence,
together with the fruits of his success at play,
which he managed so discreetly, as never to in∣cur
the reputation of an adventurer; he one day,
chanced to be at the ordinary, when the com∣pany
<PB N="154" REF="163"/>
was surprised by the entrance of such a
figure as had never appeared before in that place.
This was no other than a person habited in the
exact uniform of an English jockey. His leathern
cap, cut bob, sustian frock, flannel waistcoat,
buff breeches, hunting-boots and whip, were
sufficient of themselves to furnish out a phaeno∣menon
for the admiration of all Paris: but these
peculiarities were rendered still more conspicu∣ous
by the behaviour of the man who owned
them. When he crossed the threshold of the
outward door, he produced such a found from
the smack of his whip, as equalled the explosion
of an ordinary cohorn; and then broke forth
into the hollow of a foxhunter, which he
uttered with all its variations, in a strain of vo∣ciferation,
that seemed to astonish and confound
the whole assembly, to whom he introduced
himself and his spaniel, by exclaiming in a tone
something less melodious than the cry of macka∣rel
or live cod. “By your leave, Gentlevolks,
I hope there's no offence, in an honest plain
Englishman's coming with money in his pocket,
to taste a bit of your Vrench frigasee and ra∣gooze.”</P>
<P>This declaration was made in such a wild, fan∣tastical
manner, that the greatest part of the compa∣ny
mistook him for some savage monster or maniac,
and consulted their safety by starting up from table,
and drawing their swords. The Englishman see∣ing
such a martial apparatus produced against him,
recoiled two or three steps, saying, “Waunds, a
believe the people are all bewitched: what do
they take me for a beast of prey; is there no
body here that knows Sir Stentor Stile, or can
speak to me in my own lingo?” He had no
<PB N="155" REF="164"/>
sooner pronounced these words, than the baronet,
with marks of infinite surprize, ran towards
him, crying, “Good Heaven! Sir Stentor,
who expected to meet with you in Paris?” Up∣on
which, the other eyeing him very earnestly,
“Odds heartlikens, cried he, my neighbour Sir
Giles Squirrel, as I am a living soul!” With these
words, he flew upon him like a tyger, kissed
him from ear to ear, demolished his periwig, and
disordered the whole oeconomy of his dress, to
the no small entertainment of the company.</P>
<P>Having well nigh stifled his countryman with
embraces, and besmeared himself with pulville
from head to foot, he proceeded in this manner;
“Mercy upon thee, knight, thou art so trans∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>graphied
and bedaubed, and bedizened, that
thou mought rob thy own mother without fear of
information. Look ye here now, I will be truss∣ed,
if the very bitch that was brought up in thy
own bosom, knows thee again. Hey, sweetlips,
here hussy, damn thee tuoad, do'st n't know thy
old measter. Ey, ey, thou may'st smell till
Christmas. I'll be bound to be hanged, knight,
if the creature's nose an't foundered by the
damned stinking persumes you have got among
you.”</P>
<P>These compliments being past, the two knights
sat down by one another, and Sir Stentor be∣ing
asked by his neighbour, upon what errand
he had crossed the sea, gave him to understand,
that he had come to Franc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, in consequence of
a wager with squire Snaffle, who had laid a
thousand pounds, that he, Sir Stentor, would
not travel to Paris by himself, and for a whole
month, appear every day at a certain hour, in
the public walks, without wearing any other
<PB N="156" REF="165"/>
dress, than that in which he saw him. “The sel∣lor
has got no more stuff in his pate, continued
this polite stranger, than a jack-ass, to think I
could not find my way hither, thof I could not
jabber your French lingo. Ecod! the people of
this country, are sharp enough to find out your
meaning, when you want to spend any thing
among them: and as for the matter of dress, bo∣dikins!
for a thousand pounds, I would engage
to live in the midst of them, and shew myself
without any cloaths at all. Odd's heart! a
true-born Englishman needs not be afeard to
shew his face, nor his back-side neither, with
the best Frenchman, that ever trod the ground.
Thos we Englishmen don't beplaister our dou∣blets
with gold and silver, I believe as how we
have our pockets better lined than most of our
neighbours; and for all my bit of a sustian
frock, that cost me in all but forty shillings, I
believe, between you and me, knight, I have more
dust in my fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, than all these powdered sparks
put together. But the worst of the matter is
this; here is no solid belly timber in this coun∣try:
one can't have a slice of a delicate sirloin,
or nice buttock of beef, for love nor money.
Apize upon them! I could get no eata<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>les
upon the ruoad, but what they call Bully, which
looks like the flesh of Pharaoh's lean kine stewed
into rags and tatters; and then their peajohn,
peajohn, rabbet them! one would think every
old woman of this kingdom hatched pidgeons
from her own body.”</P>
<P>It is not to be supposed that such an original
sat unobserved. The French and other foreigners,
who had never been in England, were struck
dumb with amazement, at the knight's appear∣ance
<PB N="157" REF="166"/>
and deportment; while the English guests
were over whelmed with shame and confusion,
and kept a most wary silence, for fear of being
recognized by their countryman. As for our
adventurer, he was inwardly transported with
joy at fight of this curiosity. He considered
him as a genuine, rich country booby, of the
right English growth, fresh as imported; and
his heart throbbed with rapture, when he heard
Sir Stentor value himself upon the lining of his
pockets: he foresaw, indeed, that the other
knight would endeavour to reserve him for his
own game; but he was too conscious of his own
accomplishments to think he should find great
difficulty in superseding the influence of Sir Giles.</P>
<P>Mean while, the new comer was by his friend,
helped to some ragout, which pleased his palate,
so well, that he declared he should now m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke a
hearty meal, for the first time, since he had
crossed the water; and while his good humour
prevailed, he drank to every individual around
the table. Ferdinand seized this opportunity of
insinuating himself into his favour, by saying in
English, he was glad to find there was any thing
in France, that was agreeable to Sir Stentor:
to this compliment the knight replied with an
air of surprize. “Waunds! I find here's ano∣ther
countryman of mine, in this here com∣pany.
Sir, I am proud to see you with all my
heart.” So speaking, he thrust out his right
hand, across the table, and shook our hero by
the fist, with such violence of civility, as proved
very grievous to a French marquis, who, in
helping himself to soup, was jo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tled in such a
manner, as to overturn the dividing spoon in his
own bosom. The Englishman seeing the mis∣chief
<PB N="158" REF="167"/>
chief he had produced, cried, “no offence, I
hope,” in a tone of vociferation, which the
marquis in all probability misconstrued: for he
began to model his features into a very sub∣lime
and peremptory look, when Fathom inter∣preted
the apology, and at the same time, in∣formed
Sir Stentor, that although he himself had
not the honour of being an Englishman, he had
always entertained a most particular veneration
for the country, and learned the language in con∣sequence
of that esteem.</P>
<P>“Blood!” answered the knight, “I think my∣self
the more obliged to you for your kind opi∣nion,
than if you was my countryman in good
earnest: for there be abundance of we English,
no offence Sir Giles, that seem to be ashamed
of their own nation, and leave their homes to
come and spend their fortunes abroad, among a
parcel of—you understand me, Sir—a word to
the wise, as the saying is—” Here he was inter∣rupted
by an article of the second course, that
seemed to give him great disturbance: this was
a roasted leveret very strong of the fumet, which
happened to be placed directly under his nose,
his sense of smelling was no sooner encountered
by the effluvia of this delicious fare, than he
started up from table, exclaiming.” Odd's my
liver! here's a piece of carrion, that I would
not offer to e'er a hound in my kennel; 'tis
enough to make any christian vomit both gut
and gall;” and indeed, by the wry faces he
made while he ran to the door, his stomach
seemed ready to justify this last assertion.</P>
<P>The abbé, who concluded from these symp∣toms
of disgust, that the leveret was not suffi∣ciently
stale, began to exhibit marks of discon∣tent,
<PB N="159" REF="168"/>
and desired that it might be brought to
the other end of the table, for his examination.
He accordingly hung over it with the most greedy
appetite, feasting his nostrils with the steams of
animal putrefaction; and at length declared that
the morceau was passable, though he owned it
would have been highly perfect, had it been kept
another week. Nevertheless, mouths were not
wanting to discuss it, insipid as it was: for in
three minutes there was not a vestige to be seen
of that which had offended the organs of Sir
Stentor, who now resumed his place, and did
justice to the desert. But what he seemed to
relish better than any other part of the enter∣tainment,
was the conversation of our adven∣turer,
whom after dinner, he begged to have the
honour of treating with a dish of coffee; to the
seeming mortification of his brother knight, over
which Fathom exulted in his own heart.</P>
<P>In short, our hero, by his affability and en∣gaging
deportment, immediately gained posses∣sion
of Sir Stentor's good graces: insomuch,
that he desired to crack a bottle with him in
the evening, and they repaired to an auberge,
whither his fellow knight accompanied them,
not without manifest signs of reluctance. There
the stranger gave a loose to jollity; though at
first he damned the Burgundy as a poor, thin
liquor, that ran through him in a twinkling, and
instead of warming, cooled his heart and bowels:
however, it insensibly seemed to give the lie to
his imputation; for his spirits rose to a more ele∣vated
pitch of mirth and good fellowship; he
sung or rather roared the Early Horn so as to
alarm the whole neighbourhood, and began to
slabber his companions, with a most bearlike af∣fection,
<PB N="160" REF="169"/>
Yet, whatever haste he made to the
goal of ebriety, he was distanced by his brother
baronet, who from the beginning of the party
had made little other use of his mouth, than to
receive the glass, and now sunk down upon the
floor, in a state of temporary annihilation.</P>
<P>He was immediately carried to bed by the direc∣tion
of Ferdinand, who now saw himself in a man∣ner
possessor of that mine, to which he had made
such eager and artful advances. That he might,
therefore, carry on the approaches in the same
cautious manner, he gradually shook off the
trammels of sobriety, gave a loose to that spirit
of freedom, which good liquor commonly in∣spires,
and in the familiarity of drunkenness,
owned himself head of a noble family of Poland,
from which he had been obliged to absent him∣self
on account of an affair of honour, not yet
compromised.</P>
<P>Having made this confession, and laid strong
injunctions of secresy upon Sir Stentor, his coun∣tenance
seemed to acquire from every succeed∣ing
glass, a new symptom of intoxication: they
renewed their embraces, swore eternal friend∣ship
from that day, and swallowed fresh bum∣pers,
till both being in all appearance, quite
over-powered, they began to yawn in concert,
and even nod in their chairs. The knight
seemed to resent the attacks of slumber, as so
many impertinent attempts to interrupt their
entertainment; he cursed his own propens<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y to
sleep, imputing it to the damned French climate,
and proposed to engage in some pastime that
would keep them awake. “Odd's flesh! cried
the Briton, when I'm at home, I defy all the
devils in hell to fasten my eye-lids together, if
<PB N="161" REF="170"/>
so be as I am otherwise inclined. For there's
mother and sister Nan, and brother Numps,
and I continue to divert ourselves at all fours,
brag, cribbidge, tetotum, husle-cap, and chuck-varthing;
and tho'f I say it, that should n't say
it, I won't turn my back to e'er a he in Eng∣land,
at any of these pastimes: and so count, if
you are so disposed, I am your man, that is in
the way of friendship, at which of these you
shall please to pitch upon.”</P>
<P>To this proposal Fathom replied, he was
quite ignorant of all the games he had mention∣ed;
but, in order to amuse Sir Stentor, he would
play with him at lansquenet, for a trifle, as he
had laid it down for a maxim, to risk nothing
considerable at play. “Waunds, answered the
knight, I hope you don't think I come here in
quest of money. Thank God! I have a good
landed estate worth five thousand a year, and
owe no man a halfpenny; and I question whe∣ther
there be many counts in your nation, no
offence, I hope, that can say a bolder word. As
for your lambskin net, I know nothing of the
matter: but I will toss up with you for a guinea,
cross or pile as the saying is, or if there's such a
thing in this country as a box and dice, I love to
hear the bones rattle sometimes.”</P>
<P>Fathom found some difficulty in concealing
his joy, at the mention of this last amusement,
which had been one of his chief studies, and in
which he had made such progress, that he could
calculate all the chances with the utmost exact∣ness
and certainty. However, he made shift
to contain himself, within due bounds, and with
seeming indifference, consented to pass away an
hour at hazard, provided the implements could
<PB N="162" REF="171"/>
be procured. Accordingly, the landlord was
consulted, and their desire gratified; the dice
were produced, and the table resounded with
the effects of their mutual eagerness. Fortune,
at first, declared for the Englishman, who was
permitted by our advent<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rer to win twenty
broad pieces; and he was so elated with his suc∣cess,
as to accompany every lucky throw with a
loud burst of laughter, and other savage and
simple manisestations of excessive joy, exclaim∣ing
in a tone something less sweet than the bel∣lowing
of a bull; “Now for the main, count,
—odd! here they come—here are the seven black
stars, i'faith. Come along my yellow-boys—
odd's heart! I never liked the face of Lewis
before.”</P>
<P>Fathom drew happy presages from these boyish
raptures, and after having indulged them for
some time, began to avail himself of his arith∣metic,
in consequence of which the knight was
obliged to refund the greatest part of his winning:
then he altered his note, and became as in∣temperate
in his chagrin, as he had been be∣fore
immoderate in his mirth. He cursed him∣self
and his whole generation, damned his bad
luck, stamped with his feet, upon the floor, and
challenged Ferdinand to double stakes. This
was a very welcome proposal to our hero, who
found Sir Stentor, just such a subject as he had
long desired to encounter with; the more the
Englishman laid, the more he lost, and Fathom
took care to inflame his passions, by certain well-timed
sarcasms upon his want of judgment, 'till
at length, he became quite outrageous, swore
the dice were false, and threw them out at the
window; pulled off his periwig, and committed
<PB N="163" REF="172"/>
it to the flames, spoke with the most rancor∣ous
contempt of his adversary's skill, insisting up∣on
his having stripped many a better man, for
all he was a count, and threatning that before
they parted, he should not only look like a Pole,
but also smell like a pole-cat.</P>
<P>This was a spirit which our adventurer in∣dustriously
kept up, observing that the English
were dupes to all the world; and that in point
of genius and address, they were no more than
noisy braggadocios. In short, another pair of
dice was procured; the stakes were again raised,
and after several vicissitudes, fortune declared so
much in favour of the knight, that Fathom lost
all the money in his pocket, amounting to a
pretty considerable sum. By this time, he was
warmed into uncommon eagerness and impati∣ence;
being equally piqued at the success and
provoking exultations of his antagonist, whom
he now invited to his lodgings, in order to de∣cide
the contest: Sir Stentor complied with his
request; the dispute was renewed with various
success, till towards day-light, Ferdinand saw
this noisy, raw, unexperienced simpleton, carry
off all his ready cash, together with his jewels,
and almost every thing that was valuable about
his person; and to crown the whole, the victor
at parting, told him with a most intolerable
sneer, that so soon as the count should receive
another remittance from Poland, he would give
him his revenge.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He bears his fate like a philosopher; and contracts
acquaintance with a very remarkable personage.</HEAD>
<P>THIS was a proper subject for our hero to
moralize upon; and accordingly, it did
not pass without his remarks; he found himself
fairly foiled at his own weapons, reduced to in∣digence
in a foreign land, and, what he chiefly
regretted, robbed of all those gay expectations
he had indulged from his own supposed excel∣lence
in the wiles of fraud: for, upon a little
recollection, he plainly perceived he had fallen a
sacrifice to the confederacy he had refused to join;
and did not at all doubt that the dice were loaded
for his destruction: but instead of beating his
head against the wall, tearing his hair, impre∣cating
vain curses upon himself, or betraying
other frantic symptoms of despair, he resolved
to accommodate himself to his fate, and profit
by the lesson he had so dearly bought.</P>
<P>With this intention, he immediately dismissed
his valet, quitted his lodgings, retired to an ob∣scure
street, on the other side of the river, and
covering one eye with a large patch of black
silk, presented himself in quality of a musician,
to the director of the opera, who upon hearing
a trial of his skill, received him into the band,
without further question. While he continued
in this situation, he not only improved his taste
and execution in musick, but likewise found
frequent opportunities to extend his knowledge of
mankind; for, besides the employment he exer∣cised
in public, he was often concerned in pri∣vate
<PB N="165" REF="174"/>
concerts that were given in the hotels of
noblemen; by which means, he became more
and more acquainted with the persons, manners
and characters of high life, which he contem∣plated
with the most industrious attention, as a
spectator, who being altogether unconcerned in
the performance, is at more liberty to ob∣serve
and enjoy the particulars of the entertain∣ment.</P>
<P>It was in one of those assemblies, he had the
pleasure of seeing his friend Sir Stentor, dressed
in the most fashionable manner, and behaving
with all the overstrained politesse of a native
Frenchman: he was accompanied by his brother
knight and the abbé, and this triumvirate, even
in Fathom's hearing, gave a most ludicrous detail
of the finesse they had practised upon the Po∣lish
count, to their entertainer, who was ambas∣sador
from a certain court, and made himself
extremely merry with the particulars of the re∣lation.
Indeed, they made shift to describe some
of the circumstances in such a ridiculous light,
that our adventurer himself, smarting as he was
with the disgrace, could not help laughing in
secret at the account. He afterwards made it
his business to enquire into the characters of the
two British knights, and understood they were
notorious sharpers, who had come abroad for the
good of their country, and now hunted in cou∣ple
among a French pack, that dispersed them∣selves
through the public ordinaries, walks, and
spectacles, in order to make a prey of incautious
strangers.</P>
<P>The pride of Ferdinand was piqued at this
information; and he was even animated with
the desire of making reprisals upon this frater∣nity,
<PB N="166" REF="175"/>
from which he ardently longed to retrieve
his honour and effects: but, the issue of his last
adventure had reinforced his caution; and for
the present, he found means to suppress the dic∣tates
of his avarice and ambition; resolving to
employ his whole penetration in reconnoitring
the ground, before he should venture to take
the field again. He therefore, continued to act
the part of a one-eyed fidler, under the name of
Fadini, and lived with incredible frugality, that
he might save a purse for his future operations.
In this manner had he proceeded for the space
of ten months, during which, he acquired a
competent knowledge of the city of Paris, when
his curiosity was attracted by certain peculiarities
in the appearance of a man, who lived in one
of the upper apartments belonging to the house,
in which he himself had fixed his habitation.</P>
<P>This was a tall, thin, meagre figure, with a long
black beard, an aquiline nose, a brown complexion,
and a most piercing vivacity in his eyes: he seem∣ed
to be about the age of fifty, wore the Persian
habit, and there was a remarkable severity in his
aspect and demeanour. He and our adventurer had
been fellow-lodgers for some time, and, according
to the laudable custom of these days, had hitherto
remained as much estranged to one another, as
if they had lived on opposite fides of the globe;
but of late, the Persian seemed to regard our
hero with particular attention; when they
chanced to meet on the stair-case, or elsewhere,
he bowed to Ferdinand with great solemnity,
and complimented him with the Pas: he even
proceeded in the course of this communication,
to open his mouth, and salute him with a good
morrow, and sometimes made the common re∣marks
<PB N="167" REF="176"/>
upon the weather. Fathom, who was
naturally complaisant, did not discourage these
advances: on the contrary, he behaved to
him with marks of particular respect, and one
day, desired the favour of his company to break∣fast.</P>
<P>This invitation the stranger declined with due
acknowledgment, on pretence of being out of
order; and in the mean time, our adventurer
bethought himself of questioning the landlord
concerning his outlandish guest. His curiosity
was rather inflamed than satisfied with the infor∣mation
he could obtain from this quarter; for,
all he learned, was, that the Persian went by
the name of Ali Beker, and that he had lived in
the house, for the space of four months, in a
most solitary and parsimonious manner, without
being visited by one living soul; that, for some∣time
after his arrival, he had been often heard to
groan dismally in the night, and even to exclaim
in an unknown language, as if he had laboured
under some grievous affliction; and though the
first transports of his grief had subsided, it was
easy to perceive, he still indulged a deep rooted
melancholy, for the tears were frequently ob∣served
to trickle down his beard. The commis∣saire
of the quarter, had at first ordered this
Oriental to be watched in his out-goings, ac∣cording
to the maxims of the French police;
but his life was found so regular and inoffensive,
that this precaution was soon set aside.</P>
<P>Any man of humane sentiments, from the
knowledge of these particulars, would have been
prompted to offer his services to the sorlorn
stranger: but as our hero was devoid of all these
infirmities of human nature, it was necessary
<PB N="168" REF="177"/>
that other motives should produce the same ef∣fect:
his curiosity, therefore, joined with the
hopes of converting the confidence of Ali to his
own emolument, effectually impelled him to∣wards
his acquaintance; and in a little time,
they began to relish the conversation of each
other: for, as the reader may have already
observed, Fathom possessed all the arts of insi∣nuation;
and had discernment enough to per∣ceive
an air of dignity in the Persian, which the
humility of his circumstances could not conceal.
He was, moreover, a man of good understand∣ing,
not without a tincture of letters, perfectly
well-bred, though in a ceremonious stile, extreme∣ly
moral in his discourse, and scrupulously nice in
his notions of honour.</P>
<P>Our hero conformed himself in all respects,
to the other's opinions, and managed his discre∣tion
so as to pass upon him, for a gentleman re∣duced
by misfortunes, to the exercise of an em∣ployment
which was altogether unsuitable to his
birth and quality. He made earnest and repeat∣ed
tenders of his good offices to the stranger,
and pressed him to make use of his purse, with
such cordial perseverance, that at length Ali's
reserve was overcome, and he condescended to
borrow of him a small sum, which, in all proba∣bility,
saved his life; for he had been driven to
the utmost extremity of want before he would
accept of this assistance.</P>
<P>Fathom, having gradually stole into his good
graces, began to take notice of many piteous
sighs that escaped him, in the moments of their
intercourse, and seemed to denote an heart
fraught with woe; and on pretence of admi∣nistring
consolation and counsel, begged leave to
<PB N="169" REF="178"/>
know the cause of his distress; observing that
his mind would be disburthened by such commu∣nication,
and perhaps his grief alleviated by some
means which they might jointly concert, and
execute in his behalf.</P>
<P>Ali, thus sollicited, would often shake his
head with marks of extreme sorrow and despon∣dence,
and while the tears gushed from his
eyes, declared that his distress was beyond the
power of any remedy but death, and that by
making our hero his confident, he should only
extend his unhappiness to a friend, without feel∣ing
the least remission of his own torture. Not∣withstanding
these repeated declarations, Ferdi∣nand,
who was well enough acquainted with the
mind of man, to know that such importunity
is seldom or never disagreeable, redoubled his
instances, together with his expressions of sym∣pathy
and esteem, until the stranger was pre∣vailed
upon to gratisy his curiosity and benevo∣lence.
Having therefore, secured the chamber∣door,
one night, while all the rest of the family
was asleep, the unfortunate Hali disclosed him∣self
in these words.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="26" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The history of the noble Castilian:</HEAD>
<P>I Should be ungrateful as well as unwise, did
I longer resist the desire you express to know
the particulars of that destiny, which hath dri∣ven
me to this miserable disguise, and rendered
me in all considerations, the most wretched of
men. I have felt your friendship, am confident
of your honour, and though my misfortunes are
<PB N="170" REF="179"/>
such as can never be repaired, because I am ut∣terly
cut off from hope, which is the wretch's
last comfort, yet I may by your means, be en∣abled
to bear them with some degree of forti∣tude
and resignation.</P>
<P>Know then, my name is not Hali; neither
am I of Persian extraction. I had once the ho∣nour
to own myself a Castilian, and was, under
the appellation of Don Diego de Zelos, respect∣ed
as the head of one of the most ancient fa∣milies
of that kingdom. Judge then how se∣vere
that distress must be, which compels a Spa∣niard
to renounce his country, his honours and
his name. My you'h was not spent in inglori∣ous
case, neither did it waste unheeded in the
rolls of fame: before I had attained the age of
nineteen, I was twice wounded in battle; I
once fortunately recovered the standard of the
regiment to which I belonged, after it had been
seized by the enemy; and at another occasion
made shift to save the life of my colonel when
he lay at the mercy of an enraged barbarian.</P>
<P>He that thinks I recapitulate these particulars,
out of ostentation, does wrong to the unhappy
Don Diego de Zelos, who in having performed
these little acts of gallantry, thinks he has done
nothing, but simply approved himself worthy of
being called a Castilian. I mean only to do
justice to my own character, and to make you
acquainted with one of the most remarkable
incidents of my life. It was my fate, during
my third campaign, to command a troop of
horse in the regiment of Don Gonzales Orgullo,
between whom and my father a family-feud
had long been maintained with great enmity;
and that gentleman did not leave me without
<PB N="171" REF="180"/>
reason to believe he rejoiced at the opportunity
of exercising his resentment upon his adversary's
son; for he with-held from me that countenance
which my fellow officers enjoyed, and found
means to subject me to divers mortifications, of
which I was not at liberty to complain. These
I bore in silence, for some time, as part of my
probation in the character of a soldier; resolved
nevertheless, to employ my interest at court, for
a removal into another corps, and to take some
future opportunity of explaining my sentiments
to Don Gonzales, upon the injustice of his be∣haviour.</P>
<P>While I animated myself with these senti∣ments,
against the discouragements I underwent,
and the hard duty to which I was daily exposed,
it was our fate to be concerned in the battle of
Saragossa, where our regiment was so severely
handled by the English infantry, that it was
forced to give ground with the loss of one half
of its officers and men. Don Gonzales, who
acted as brigadier in another wing, being in∣formed
of our sate, and dreading the disgrace of
his corps, which had never turned back to the
enemy, put spurs to his horse, and riding across
the field at full speed, rallied our broken squa∣drons,
and led us back to the charge, with such
intrepidity of behaviour, as did not fail to in∣spire
us all with uncommon courage and alacrity:
for my own part, I thought myself doubly inte∣rested,
to distinguish my valour; not only on
account of my own glory, but likewise on the
supposition, that as I was acting under the eye
of Gonzales, my conduct would be narrowly
observed.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="181"/>
I therefore exerted myself with unusual vigour,
and as he began the attack with the remains of
my troop, fought close by his side, during the
rest of the engagement. I even acquired his
applause in the very heat of battle: when his
hat was struck off, and his horse fell under him,
I accommodated and remounted him upon my
own, and having seized for my own use, ano∣ther
that belonged to a common trooper, attend∣ed
this stern commander as before, and seconded
him in all his repeated efforts: but it was impos∣sible
to withstand the numbers and impetuosity
of the foe, and Don Gonzales having had the
mortification to see his regiment cut in pieces,
and the greatest part of the army routed, was
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain to yield to the fortune of the day; yet he
retired as became a man of honour and a Casti∣lian:
that is, he marched off with great delibe∣ration,
in the rear of the Spanish troops, and
frequently faced about to check the pursuit of the
enemy. Indeed, this exercise of his courage had
well nigh cost him his life; for, in one of these
wheelings, he was left almost alone, and a small
party of the Portuguese horse had actually cut
off our communication with the retreating forces
of Spain.</P>
<P>In this dilemma, we had no other chance for
saving our lives and liberty, than that of opening
a passage sword in hand; and this was what Gon∣zales
instantly resolved to attempt. We accord∣ingly
recommended our souls to God, and charg∣ing
the line abreast of another, bore down all
opposition, and were in a fair way of accomplish∣ing
our retreat, without further danger; but the
gallant Orgullo, in crossing a ditch, had the mis∣fortune
to be thrown from his horse, and was
<PB N="173" REF="182"/>
almost the same instant overtaken by one of the
Portuguese dragoons, whose sword was already
suspended over his head, as he lay half-stunned
with his fall; when I rode up, discharged a pis∣tol
in the russian's brain, and seating my colonel
on his horse, had the good fortune to conduct
him to a place of safety.</P>
<P>Here he was provided with such accommoda∣tion
as his case required: for, he had been
wounded in the battle, and dangerously bruised
by his fall, and when all the necessary steps
were taken towards his recovery, I desired to
know if he had any further commands for his
service, being resolved to join the army without
delay. I thought proper to communicate this
question, by message, because he had not spoke
one word to me, during our retreat, notwith∣standing
the good office he had received at my
hands; a reserve which I attributed to his pride,
and resented accordingly. He no sooner under∣stood
my intention, than he desired to see me
in his apartment, and as near as I can remember
spoke to this effect.</P>
<P>“Were your father Don Alonzo alive, I
should now, in consequence of your behaviour,
banish every suggestion of resentment, and sol∣licit
his friendship, with great sincerity. Yes,
Don Diego, your virtue hath triumphed over that
enmity I bore your house, and I upbraid myself
with the ungenerous treatment you have suffered
under my command. But it is not enough for
me to withdraw that rigour which it was un∣just
to exercise, and would be wicked to main∣tain:
I must likewise attone for the injuries you
have sustained, and make some suitable acknow∣ledgment
for that life which I have twice to∣day
<PB N="174" REF="183"/>
owed to your valour and generosity. What∣ever
interest I have at court, shall be employed
in your behalf; and I have other designs in your
favour, which shall be disclosed in due season.
Mean while, I desire you will still add one ob∣ligation
to the debt which I have already in∣curred,
and carry this billet, in person, to my
Estisania, who from the news of this fatal
overthrow, must be in despair upon my ac∣count.”</P>
<P>So saying, he presented a letter, directed to his
lady, which I received in a transport of joy,
with expressions suitable to the occasion, and
immediately set out for his country-house, which
happened to be about thirty leagues from the
spot. This expedition was equally glorious and
interesting: for my thoughts upon the road were
engrossed by the hope of seeing Don Orgullo's
daughter and heiress Antonia, who was report∣ed
to be a young lady of great beauty, and the
most amiable accomplishments. However ridi∣culous
it may seem, for a man to conceive a pas∣sion
for an object which he hath never beheld,
certain it is, my sentiments were so much pre∣possessed
by the fame of her qualifications, that
I must have fallen a victim to her charms, had
they been much less powerful than they were.
Notwithstanding the fatigues I had undergone
in the field, I closed not an eye, until I arrived
at the gate of Gonzales, being determined to
precede the report of the battle, that madam
d'Org<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llo might not be alarmed for the life of
her husband.</P>
<P>I declared my errand, and was introduced into
a saloon, where I had not waited above three
minutes, when my colonel's lady appeared, and
<PB N="175" REF="184"/>
in great confusion, received the letter, exclaiming.
“Heaven grant that Don Gonzales be well!”
In reading the contents, she underwent a variety
of agitations; but when she had perused the whole,
her countenance regained its se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enity, and re∣garding
me with an air of ineffable complacency,
“Don Diego,” said she, “while I lament the
national calamity, in the defeat of our army, I at
the same time, feel the most sincere pleasure, in
seeing you upon this occasion, and according to
the directions of my dear lord, bid you heartily
welcome to this house, as his preserver and
friend. I was not unacquainted with your cha∣racter,
before this last triumph of your virtue,
and have often prayed to Heaven, for some lucky
determination of that fatal quarrel, which raged
so long between the family of Gonzales and your
father's house. My prayers have been heard,
the long wished-for reconciliation is now effected,
and I hope nothing will ever intervene, to di∣sturb
this happy union.”</P>
<P>To this polite and affectionate declaration, I
made such a reply, as became a young man,
whose heart overflowed with joy and benevo∣lence,
and desired to know how soon her an∣swer
to my commander would be ready, that I
might gratify his impatience, with all possible
dispatch. After having thanked me for this fresh
proof of my attachment, she begged I would retire
into a chamber, and repose myself from the un∣common
fatigues I must have undergone; but,
finding I persisted in the resolution of returning
to Don Gonzales, without allowing myself the
least benefit of sleep, she left me engaged in
conversation with an uncle of Don Gonzales,
<PB N="176" REF="185"/>
who lodged in the house, and gave orders that a
collation should be prepared in another apart∣ment,
while she retired to her closet, and wrote
a letter to her husband.</P>
<P>In less than an hour from my first arrival, I
was introduced into a most elegant dining-room,
where a magnificent entertainment was served
up, and where we were joined by Donna Esti∣sania,
and her beautiful daughter the fair Anto∣nia,
who advancing, with the most amiable
sweetness, thanked me in very warm expressions
of acknowledgment, for the generosity of my
conduct towards her father. I had been ravished
with her first appearance, which far exceeded
my imagination, and my faculties were so dis∣ordered
by this address, that I answered her com∣pliment
with the most aukward confusion. But
this disorder did not turn to my prejudice in the
opinion of that lovely creature, who has often
told me in the sequel, that she gave herself cre∣dit
for that perplexity in my behaviour, and that
I never appeared more worthy of her regard and
affection, than at that juncture, when my dress
was discomposed, and my whole person dis∣figured
by the toils and duty of the preceding
day; for this very dishabille presented itself to
her reflexion as the immediate effect of that
very merit by which I was intitled to her
esteem.</P>
<P>Wretch that I am! to survive the loss of such
an excellent woman, endeared to my remem∣brance
by the most tender offices of wedlock,
happily exercised for the space of five and twenty
years! Forgive these tears, they are not the drops
of weakness, but remorse. Not to trouble you
with idle particulars, suffice it to say, I was fa∣voured
<PB N="177" REF="186"/>
with such marks of distinction, by ma∣dam
d'Orgullo, that she thought it incumbent
upon her to let me know, she had not over∣acted
her hospitality, and while we sat at table,
accosted me in these words: “You will not
be surprised, Don Diego, at my expressions of
regard, which I own are unusual from a Spanish
lady to a young cavalier like you, when I com∣municate
the contents of this letter from Don
Gonzales.” So saying, she put the billet into
my hand, and I read these words, or words to
this effect.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>“Amiable Estifania,</OPENER>
<P>You will understand, that I am as well
as a person can possibly be, who hath this day
lived to see the army of his king defeated.
If you would know the particulars of this un∣fortunate
action, your curiosity will be grati∣fied
by the bearer Don Diego de Zelos, to
whose virtue and bravery I am twice indebt∣ed
for my life. I therefore desire you will
receive him with that respect and gratitude,
which you shall think due for such an obli∣gation;
and in entertaining him, dismiss that
reserve, which often disgraces the Spanish
hospitality. In a word, let your own virtue
and beneficence conduct you upon this occa∣sion,
and let my Antonia's endeavours be
joined with your own, in doing honour to the
preserver of her father. Adieu.”</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Such a testimonial could not fail of being
very agreeable to a young soldier, who by thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
time, had begun to indulge the transporting hops
of being happy in the arms of the adorable Ane∣tonia.
<PB N="178" REF="187"/>
I professed myself extremely happy in
having met with an opportunity of acquiring
such a degree of my colonel's esteem, entertain∣ed
them with a detail of his personal prowess in
the battle, and answered all their questions with
that moderation which every man ought to pre∣serve
in speaking of his own behaviour. Our
repast being ended, I took my leave of the la∣dies,
and at parting received a letter from Donna
Estifania to her husband, together with a ring of
great value, which she begged I would accept,
as a token of her esteem. Thus loaded with
honour and caresses, I set out on my return for
the quarters of Don Gonzales, who could scarce
credit his own eyes when I delivered his lady's
billet; for he thought it impossible to perform
such a journey in so short a time.</P>
<P>When he had glanced over the paper, “Don
Diego,” said he, “by your short stay, one
would imagine you had met with indifferent re∣ception
at my house: I hope Estifania has not
been deficient in her duty.” I answered this
question, by assuring him, my entertainment
had been so agreeable in all respects, that no∣thing
but my duty to him, could have induced
me to give it up so soon. He then turned the
conversation upon Antonia, and hinted his inten∣tion
of giving her in marriage to a young cava∣lier,
for whom he had a particular friendship. I
was so much affected by this insinuation, which
seemed at once to blast all my hopes of love and
happiness, that the blood forsook my face; I
was seized with an universal trepidation, and
even obliged to retire, on pretence of being sud∣denly
taken ill.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="188"/>
Though Gonzales seemed to impute this dis∣order
to fatigue and want of rest, he in his heart
ascribed it to the true cause, and after having
sounded my sentiments to his own satisfaction, bles∣sed
me with a declaration, importing that I was the
person upon whom he had pitched for a son-in-law.
I will not trouble you with a repeti∣tion
of what passed on this interesting occasion,
but proceed to observe, that his intention in my
favour was far from being disagreeable to his
lady; and that, in a little time, I had the good
fortune to espouse the charming Antonia, who
submitted to the will of her father without re∣luctance.</P>
<P>Soon after this happy event, I was, by the in∣fluence
of Don Gonzales, joined to my own in∣terest,
promoted to the command of a regiment,
and served with honour during the remaining
part of the war. After the treaty of Utrecht,
I was employed in reducing the Catalans to their
allegiance, and in an action with these obstinate
rebels, had the misfortune to lose my father-in-law,
who by that time was preferred to the rank
of a major-general. The virtuous Estifania did
not long survive this melancholy accident; and
the loss of these indulgent parents, made such a
deep impression upon the tender heart of my An∣tonia,
that I took the first opportunity of re∣moving
her from a place, in which every object
served to cherish her grief, to a pleasant villa,
near the city of Seville, which I purchased on
account of its agreeable situation. That I might
the more perfectly enjoy the possession of my
amiable partner, who could no longer brook
the thoughts of another separation, pea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was
no sooner re-established, than I obtained leave to
<PB N="180" REF="189"/>
resign my commission, and I wholly devoted my∣self
to the joys of a domestic life.</P>
<P>Heaven seemed to smile upon our union, by
blessing us with a son, whom, however, it was
pleased to recall in his infancy, to our unspeak∣able
grief and mortification; but, our mutual
chagrin was afterwards alleviated, by the birth
of a daughter, who seemed born with every ac∣complishment
to excite the love and admiration
of mankind. Why did nature debase such a
master-piece with the mixture of an allay, which
hath involved herself and her whole family in
perdition? but the ways of Providence are un∣searchable.
She hath paid the debt of her dege∣neracy;
peace be with her soul! the honour of
my family is vindicated; though by a sacrifice
which hath robbed me of every thing else that
is valuable in life, and ruined my peace past all
redemption. Yes, my friend, all the tortures
that human tyranny can inflict, would be ease,
tranquillity and delight, to the unspeakable pangs
and horrors I have felt.</P>
<P>But, to return from this digression: Serafina,
which was the name of that little darling, as
she grew up, not only disclosed all the natural
graces of external beauty, but likewise manifest∣ed
the most engaging sweetness of disposition,
and a capacity for acquiring with ease, all the
accomplishments of her sex. 'Tis impossible to
convey any adequate idea of a parent's raptures
in the contemplation of such a fair blossom;
she was the only pledge of our love, she was
presumptive heiress to a large fortune, and likely
to be the sole representative of two noble Casti∣lian
families. She was the delight of all who
saw her, and a theme of praise for every tongue.
<PB N="181" REF="190"/>
You are not to suppose, that the education o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
such a child was neglected. Indeed it wholly
engrossed the attention of me and my Antonia,
and her proficiency rewarded our care. Before
she had attained the age of fifteen, she was
mistress of every elegant qualification, natural
and acquired. Her person was, by that time, the
confessed pattern of beauty. Her voice was en∣chantingly
sweet, and she touched the lute with
the most ravishing dexterity. Heaven and earth!
how did my breast dilate with joy, at the thoughts
of having given birth to such perfection! how
did my heart gush with paternal fondness, when∣ever
I beheld this ornament of my name! and
what scenes of endearing transport, have I en∣joyed
with my Antonia, in mutual congratula∣tion
upon our parental happiness.</P>
<P>Serafina, accomplished as she was, could not
fail to make conquests among the Spanish cava∣liers,
who are famous for sensibility in love. In∣deed,
she never appeared without a numerous
train of admirers, and though we had bred her
up in that freedom of conversation and inter∣course,
which holds a middle space, between the
French license and Spanish restraint, she was
now so much exposed to the addresses of pro∣miscuous
gallantry, that we found it necessary
to retrench the liberty of our house; and behave
to our male visitants with great reserve and cir∣cumspection,
that our honour! and peace might
run no risque from the youth and inexperience
of our daughter.</P>
<P>This caution produced overtures from a great
many young gentlemen of rank and distinction,
who courted my alliance by demanding Sera∣fina
in marriage; and from the number, I had
<PB N="182" REF="191"/>
actually selected one person, who was in all res∣pects
worthy the possession of such an inestima∣ble
prize. His name was Don Manuel de Men∣doza;
his birth was noble, and his character dig∣nified
with repeated acts of generosity and vir∣tue.
Yet, before I would signify to him my
approbation of his suit, I resolved to inform my∣self,
whether or not the heart of Serafina was to∣tally
unengaged, and indifferent to any other
object, that I might not lay a tyrannical restraint
upon her inclinations. The result of my en∣quiry
was a full conviction of her having hither∣to
been deaf to the voice of love; and this piece
of information, together with my own sentiments
in his favour, I communicated to Don Manuel,
who heard these tidings with transports of grati∣tude
and joy. He was immediately favoured
with opportunities of acquiring the affection of
my daughter, and his endeavours were at first
received with such respectful civility, as might
have been easily warmed into a mutual passion,
had not the evil genius of our family inter∣posed.</P>
<P>O my friend! how shall I describe the depra∣vity
of that unhappy virgin's sentiments! how
recount the particulars of my own dishonour
I that am descended from a long line of illustri∣ous
Castilians, who never received an injury they
did not revenge; but washed away every blemist<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in their fame, with the blood of those who at∣tempted
to stain it. In that circumstance, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
have imitated the example of my glorious proge∣nitors;
and that consideration alone, hath sup∣ported
me against all the assaults of despair.</P>
<P>As I grudged no pains and expence in perfectin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the education of Serafina, my doors were open <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="183" REF="192"/>
every person who made an extraordinary figure in
the profession of those amusing sciences, in which
she delighted. The house of Don Diego de Zelos
was a little academy for painting, poetry and mu∣sic;
and Heaven decreed that it should fall a sacrifice
to its regard for these fatal and delusive arts.
Among other pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ceptors, it was her fate to be
under the instruction of a cursed German; who,
though his profession was drawing, understood
the elements and theory of musick, possessed a
large fund of learning and taste, and was a per∣son
remarkable for his agreeable conversation.
This traitor, who like you, had lost one eye, I
not only admitted into my house, for the im∣provement
of my daughter, but even distinguish∣ed
with particular marks of confidence and fa∣vour;
little thinking he had either inclination or
capacity to debauch the sentiments of my child.
I was rejoiced beyond measure, to see with what
alacrity she received his lessons, with what avi∣dity
she listened to his discourse, which was al∣ways
equally moral, instructing and enter∣taining.</P>
<P>Antonia seemed to vie with me, in expres∣sions
of regard for this accomplished stranger,
whom she could not help supposing to be a per∣son
of rank and family, reduced to his present
situation, by some unfortunate vicissitude of fate.
I was disposed to concur with this opinion, and
actually conjured him to make me his confident,
with such protestations, as left him no room to
doubt my honour and beneficence; but he still
persisted in declaring himself the son of an ob∣scure
mechanic in Bohemia; an origin to which
surely no man would pretend, who had the least
<PB N="184" REF="193"/>
claim to nobility of birth. While I was thus
undeceived in my conjecture, touching his birth
and quality, I was confirmed in an opinion of
his integrity and moderation, and looked upon
him as a man of honour, in despite of the low∣ness
of his pedigree. Nevertheless he was at
bottom, a most perfidious wretch, and all this
modesty and self-denial were the effects of the
most villainous dissimulation, a cloak under which
he unsuspected robbed me of my honour and my
peace.</P>
<P>Not to trouble you with particulars, the reci∣tal
of which would tear my heart-strings with
indignation and remorse, I shall only observe,
that by the power of his infernal insinuation,
he fascinated the heart of Serafina, brought over
Antonia herself to the interests of his passion,
and at once detached them both from their duty
and religion. Heaven and earth! how dange∣rous,
how irresistible is the power of infatuation!
while I remained in the midst of this blind se∣curity,
waiting for the nuptials of my daughter,
and indulging myself with the vain prospect of
her approaching felicity, Antonia found means
to protract the negociation of the marriage, by
representing that it would be pity to deprive Se∣rafina
of the opportunity she then had of pro∣fiting
by the German's instructions; and upon
that account I prevailed upon Don Manuel to
bridle the impatience of his love.</P>
<P>During this interval, as I one evening enjoyed
the cool air in my own garden, I was accosted
by an old duenna, who had been my nu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se, and
lived in the family since the time of my childhood.
“My duty, said she, will no longer permit me
to wink in silence, at the wrongs I see you dai∣ly
<PB N="185" REF="194"/>
suffer. Dismiss that German from your house,
without delay, if you respect the glory of your
name, and the rights of our holy religion: the
stranger is an abominable heretic; and, grant
Heaven! he may not have already poisoned the
minds of those you hold most dear.” I had
been extremely alarmed at the beginning of this
address, but finding the imputation limited to
the article of religion, in which, thank God, I
am no bigot, I recovered my serenitiy of dispo∣sition,
thanked the old woman for her zeal, com∣mended
her piety, and encouraged her to perse∣vere
in making observations on such subjects as
should concern my honour and my quiet.</P>
<P>We live in such a world of wickedness and
fraud, that a man cannot be too vigilant in his
own defence: had I employed such spies from
the beginning, I should, in all probability, have
been at this day in possession of every comfort
that renders life agreeable. The duenna thus
authorized, employed her sagacity with such suc∣cess,
that I had reason to suspect the German
of a design upon the heart of Serafina; but, as
the presumptions did not amount to conviction,
I contented myself with exiling him from my
house, under the pretext of having discovered,
that he was an enemy to the catholic church;
and forthwith appointed a day for the celebration
of my daughter's marriage, with Don Manuel de
Mendosa. I could easily perceive a cloud of me∣lancholy
overspread the faces of Serafina and
her mother, when I declared these my resolu∣tions;
but, as they made no objection to what
I proposed, I did not, at that time, enter into an
explanation of the true motives that influenced
<PB N="186" REF="195"/>
my conduct. Both parties were, probably,
afraid of such expostulation.</P>
<P>Mean while, preparations were made for the
spousals of Serafina; and, notwithstanding the
anxiety I had undergone, on account of her con∣nexion
with the German, I began to think that
her duty, her g'ory, had triumphed over all such
low-born considerations, if ever they had been
entertained; because she and even Antonia seemed
to expect the ceremony with resignation, though
the features of both still retained evident marks
of concern, which I willingly imputed to the
mutual prospect of their separation. This, how∣ever,
was but a faithless calm, that soon, ah!
too soon, brought forth a tempest, which hath
wrecked my hopes.</P>
<P>Two days before the appointed union of don
Manuel and Serafina, I was informed by the du∣enna,
that while she accompanied Antonia's
waiting maid at church, she had seen her receive
a billet from a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> old woman, who, kneeling at
her side, had conveyed it in such a mysterious
manner, as wakened the duenna's apprehensions
about her young lady; she had therefore hastened
home to communicate this piece of intelligence,
that I might have an opportunity of examining
the messenger before she should have time to de∣posit
her trust. I could not help shivering with
fearful presages, upon this occasion, and even
abhorring the person to whose duty and zeal <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
was beholden for the intelligence, even while <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
endeavoured to persuade myself, that the inquiry
would end in the detection of some paultry in∣trigue,
between the maid and her own gallant,
I intercepted her in returning from church, and
commanding her to follow me to a convenient
<PB N="187" REF="196"/>
place, extorted from her by dint of threats, the
fatal letter, which I read to this effect.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>“The whole business of my life, O divine
Serafina! will be to repay that affection I
have been so happy as to engage. With what
transport then shall I obey your summons, in
performing that enterprize, which will rescue
you from the bed of a detested rival, and put
myself in full possession of a jewel, which I va∣lue
infinitely more than life. Yes, adorable
creature, I have provided every thing for our
escape, and at midnight will attend you in your

<CLOSER><SIGNED>ORLANDO.”</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Were you a fond parent, a tender husband and
a noble Castilia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, I should not need to mention
the unutterable horrors that took possession of
my bosom, when I perused this accursed letter,
by which I learned the apostasy, disobedience,
and degeneracy of my idolized Serafina, who
had overthrown and destroyed the whole plan of
felicity which I had erected, and blasted all the
glories of my name; and when the wretched
messenger, terrified by my menaces and agita∣tion,
confessed that Antonia herself was privy to
the guilt of her daughter, whom she had so∣lemly
betrothed to that vile German, in the
fight of Heaven, and that by her connivance,
this Plebeian intended that very night, to bereave
me of my child; I was for some moments stu∣pified
<PB N="188" REF="197"/>
with grief and amazement, that gave way
to an extasy of rage, which had well-nigh ter∣minated
in despair and distraction.</P>
<P>I now tremble, and my head grows giddy
with the remembrance of that dreadful occa∣sion:
behold how the drops trickle down
my forehead; this agony is a fierce and familiar
visitant, I shall banish it anon. I summoned
my pride, my resentment to my assistance; these
are the cordials that support me against all other
reflections; those were the auxiliaries that ena∣bled
me in the day of trial, to perform that sa∣crifice
which my honour demanded, in a strain
so loud, as to drown the cries of nature, love
and compassion. Yes, they espoused that glory,
which humanity would have betrayed, and my
revenge was noble, though unnatural.</P>
<P>My scheme was soon laid, my resolution soon
taken; I privately confined the wretch who had
been the industrious slave of this infamous con∣spiracy,
that she might take no step to frustrate,
or interrupt the execution of my design. Then
repairing to the house of an apothecary, who
was devoted to my service, communicated my
intention, which he durst not condemn, and
could not reveal, without breaking the oath of
secrecy I had imposed; and he furnished me
with two vials of poison, for the dismal catas∣trophe
I had planned. Thus provided, I on
pretence of sudden business at Seville, carefully
avoided the dear, the wretched pair, whom I
had devoted to death, that my heart might not
relent, by means of those tender ideas, which
the sight of them would have infallibly inspired;
and when day-light vanished, took my station
near that part of the house, through which the
<PB N="189" REF="198"/>
villain must have entered, on his hellish pur∣pose.
There I stood in a state of horrid expec∣tation,
my soul ravaged with the different pas∣sions
that assailed it, until the fatal moment ar∣rived;
when I perceived the traitor approach the
window of a lower apartment, which led into
that of Serafina, and gently lifting the case∣ment,
which was purposely left unsecured, insi∣nuate
half of his body into the house: then rush∣ing
upon him, in a transport of fury, I plunged my
sword into his heart, crying “Villain! receive
the reward of thy treachery and presumption.”</P>
<P>The steel was so well aimed as to render a
repetition of the stroke unnecessary; he uttered
one groan, and fell breathless at my feet. Ex∣ulting
with this first success of my revenge, I
penetrated into the chamber, where the robber
of my peace was expected by the unhappy Sera∣fina
and her mother, who seeing me enter with
a most savage aspect, and a sword reeking with
the vengeance I had taken, seemed almost petri∣fied
with fear. “Behold,” said I, “the blood
of that base plebeian, who made an attempt up∣on
the honour of my house: your conspiracy a∣gainst
the unfortunate Don Diego de Zelos, is
now discovered; that presumptuous slave, the
favoured Orlando, is now no more.”</P>
<P>Scarce had I pronounced these words, when a
loud scream was uttered by both the unhappy
victims. “If Orlando is slain, cried the infa∣tuated
Serafina, what have I to do with life?
O my dear lord! my husband, and my lover!
how are our promised joys at once cut off! here
strike, my father, compleat your barbarous sa∣crifice,
the spirit of the murdered Orlando still
hovers for his wife.” These frantic exclama∣tions,
<PB N="190" REF="199"/>
in which she was joined by Antonia, kept
up the fury of my resentment, which by meek∣ness
and submission might have been weakened
and rendered ineffectual. “Yes, hapless
wretches,” I replied, “ye shall enjoy your wish:
the honour of my name requires that both shall
die; yet I will not mangle the breast of An∣tonia,
on which I have so often reposed;
I will not shed the blood of Zelos, nor
disfigure the beauteous form of Serafina, on
which I have so often gazed with wonder and
unspeakable delight: here is an elixir, to which
I trust the consummation of my revenge.”</P>
<P>So saying, I emptied the vials into separate
cups, and presenting one in each hand, the mi∣serable,
the fair offenders, instantly received the
destined draughts, which they drank without
hesitation: then praying to Heaven for the
wretched Don Diego, sunk upon the same couch,
and expired without a groan. O well-contrived
beverage! O happy composition, by which all
the miseries of life are so easily cured!</P>
<P>Such was the fate of Antonia and Serafina;
these hands were the instruments that deprived
them of life, these eyes beheld them the richest
prize that death had ever won. Powers su∣preme!
does Don Diego live to make this reca∣pitulation?
I have done my duty; but ah! I
am haunted by the furies of remorse: I am tor∣tured
with the incessant stings of remembrance
and regret; even now the images of my wife
and daughter, present themselves to my imagi∣nation.
All the scenes of happiness I have en∣joyed
as a lover, husband and parent, all the en∣dearing
hopes I have cherished, now pass in re∣view
before me, embittering the circumstances
of my inexpressible woe; and I consider myself
<PB N="191" REF="200"/>
as a solitary outcast from all the comforts of so∣ciety.
But, enough of these unmanly complaints,
the yearnings of nature are too importunate.</P>
<P>Having compleated my vengeance, I retired
into my closet, and furnishing myself with some
ready money and jewels of considerable value,
went into the stable, saddled my favourite steed,
which I instantly mounted, and before the tu∣mults
of my breast subsided, found myself at the
town of St. Lucar. There I learned from in∣quiry,
that there was a Dutch bark in the har∣bour
ready to sail; upon which, I addressed my∣self
to the master, who for a suitable gratifica∣tion,
was prevailed upon to weigh anchor that
same night; so that embarking without delay, I
soon bid eternal adieu to my native country. It
was not from reason and reflection, that I took
these measures for my personal safety; but in
consequence of an involuntary instinct, that seems
to operate in the animal machine, while the fa∣culty
of thinking is suspended.</P>
<P>To what a dreadful reckoning was I called,
when reason resumed her function! you may
believe me, my friend, when I assure you, that
I should not have outlived those tragedies I act∣ed,
had I not been restrained from doing vio∣lence
upon myself, by certain considerations,
which no man of honour ought to set aside. I
could not bear the thought of falling ingloriously
by the hand of an executioner, and intailing
disgrace upon a family that knew no stain; and
I was deterred from putting an end to my own
misery, by the apprehensions of posthumous
censure, which would have represented me as a
desponding wretch, utterly destitute of that pa∣tience,
fortitude and resignation, which are the
<PB N="192" REF="201"/>
characteristics of a true Castilian. I was also influ∣enced
by religious motives, that suggested to me
the necessity of living to attone by my sufferings
and sorrow, for the guilt I had incurred, in
complying with a savage punctilio, which is, I
fear, displeasing in the sight of Heaven.</P>
<P>These were the reasons that opposed my en∣trance
into that peaceful harbour, which death
presented to my view; and they were soon re∣inforced
by another principle, that sanctioned
my determination, to continue at the servile oar
of life. In consequence of unfavourable winds,
our vessel for some days made small progress
in her voyage to Holland, and near the coast of
Gallicia we were joined by an English ship
from Vigo, the master of which gave us to un∣derstand,
that before he set fail, a courier had
arrived from Madrid, at that place, with orders
for the corregidor, to prevent the escape of any
native Spaniard, by sea, from any port within
his district; and to use his utmost endeavours to
apprehend the person of Don Diego de Zelos,
who was suspected of treasonable practices
against the state. Such an order, with a mi∣nute
description of my person, was at the same
time, dispatched to all the sea-ports and frontier
places in Spain.</P>
<P>You may easily suppose how I, who was al∣ready
overwhelmed with distress, could bear
this aggravation of misfortune and disgrace: I,
who had always maintained the reputation of
loyalty, which was acquired at the hazard of
my life, and the expence of my blood. To
deal candidly, I must own, that this intelligence
roused me from a lethargy of grief, which had
begun to overpower my faculties. I immediately
<PB N="193" REF="202"/>
imputed this dishonourable charge to the evil of∣fices
of some villain, who had basely taken
the advantage of my deplorable situation, and I
was inflamed, inspirited with the desire of vindi∣cating
my same, and revenging the injury. Thus
animated, I resolved to disguise myself effectu∣ally
from the observation of those spies, which
every nation finds its account in employing, in
foreign countries; I purchased this habit from
the Dutch navigator, in whose house I kept my∣self
concealed, after our arrival at Amsterdam,
until my beard was grown to a sufficient length
to favour my design, and then appeared as a Per∣sian
dealer in jewels. As I could gain no satis∣factory
information touching myself, in this
country, had no purpose to pursue, and was
extremely miserable among a people, who being
mercenary and unsocial, were very ill adapted to
alleviate the horrors of my condition; I grati∣fied
my landlord for his important services, with
the best part of my effects; and having, by his
means, procured a certificate from the magi∣stracy,
repaired to Rotterdam, from whence I
set out in a travelling carriage for Antwerp, on
my way to this capital; hoping with a succession
of different objects, to mitigate the anguish of
my mind, and by the most industrious enquiry,
to learn such particulars of that false impeach∣ment,
as would enable me to take measures for
my own justification, as well as for projecting a
plan of revenge against the vile perfidious au∣thor.</P>
<P>This, I imagined, would be no difficult task,
considering the friendship and intercourse subsist∣ing
between the Spanish and French nations, and
the communicative disposition, for which the
<PB N="194" REF="203"/>
Parisians are renowned; but I have found myself
egregiously deceived in my expectation: the of∣ficers
of the Police in this city are so inquisitive
and vigilant, that the most minute action of a
stranger, is scrutinized with great severity; and
although the inhabitants are very frank in dis∣coursing
on indifferent subjects, they are at the
same time extremely cautious in avoiding all con∣versation
that turns upon state occurrences and
maxims of government. In a word, the pecu∣liarity
of my appearance, subjects me so much
to particular observation, that I have hitherto
thought proper to devour my griefs in silence,
and even to bear the want of almost every con∣venience,
rather than hazard a premature disco∣very,
by offering my jewels to sale.</P>
<P>In this emergency, I have been so far fortu∣nate
as to become acquainted with you, whom I
look upon as a man of honour and humanity.
Indeed, I was at first fight, prepossessed in your
favour: for notwithstanding the mistakes which
men daily commit in judging from appearances,
there is something in the physiognomy of a
stranger, from which one cannot help forming
an opinion of his character and disposition. For
once, my penetration hath not failed me; your
behaviour justifies my decision, you have treated
me with that sympathy and respect which none
but the generous will pay to the unfortunate. I
have trusted you accordingly: I have put my
life, my honour in your power; and I must beg
leave to depend upon your friendship, for obtain∣ing
that satisfaction, for which alone I seek to
live. Your employment engages you in the gay
world: you daily mingle with the societies of
men; the domestics of the Spanish ambassader
<PB N="195" REF="204"/>
will not shun your acquaintance; you may fre∣quent
the coffee-houses to which they resort;
and in the course of these occasions, unsuspected
inform yourself of that mysterious charge which
lies heavy on the fame of the unfortunate Don
Diego. I must likewise, implore your assistance
in converting my jewels into money, that I
may breathe independant of man, until Heaven
shall permit me to finish this weary pilgrimage
of life.</P>

story, no sooner heard it concluded, than with
an aspect of generous and cordial compassion,
not even unattended with tears, he condoled the
lamentable fate of Don Diego de Zelos; deplored
the untimely death of the gentle Antonia and
the fair Serafina, and undertook the interests of
the wretched Castilian with such warmth of
sympathizing zeal, as drew a flood from his eyes,
while he wrung his benefactor's hand in a trans∣port
of gratitude. Those were literally tears of
joy, or at least of satisfaction on both sides; as
our hero wept with affection and attachment to
the jewels that were to be committed to his
care: but, far from discovering the true source
of his tenderness, he affected to dissuade the
Spaniard from parting with the diamonds, which
he counselled him to reserve for a more pressing
occasion; and in the mean time, earnestly in∣treated
<PB N="196" REF="205"/>
him to depend upon his friendship, for
present relief. This generous proffer served only
to confirm Don Diego's resolution, which he
forthwith executed, by putting into the hands of
Ferdinand, jewels to the value of a thousand
crowns, and desiring him to detain for his own
use, any part of the sum they would raise.</P>
<P>Our adventurer thanked him for the good opi∣nion
he entertained of his integrity, an opinion
fully manifested in honouring him with such im∣portant
confidence; and assured him he would
transact his affairs with the utmost diligence,
caution and dispatch. The evening being by
this time almost consumed, these new allies re∣tired
separately to rest: though each passed the
night without repose, in very different reflecti∣ons;
the Castilian being, as usual, agitated with
the unceasing pangs of his unalterable misery,
interspersed with gleaming hopes of revenge;
and Fathom being kept awake with revolving
plans, for turning his fellow-lodger's credulity to
his own advantage. From the nature of the
Spaniard's situation, he might have appropriated
the jewels to himself, and remained in Paris,
without fear of a prosecution, because the in∣jured
party had, by the above narrative, left his
life and liberty at discretion. But he did not
think himself secure from the personal resent∣ment
of an enraged desperate Castilian; and
therefore determined to withdraw himself pri∣vately
into that country where he had all along
proposed to fix the standard of his finesse, which
fortune had now impowered him to exercise ac∣cording
to his wish.</P>
<P>Bent upon this retreat, he went abroad in the
morning, on pretence of acting in the concerns
<PB N="197" REF="206"/>
of his friend Don Diego, and having hired a
post-chaise to be ready at the dawn of next
day, returned to his lodgings, where he cajoled
the Spaniard with a seigned report of his nego∣tiation;
then securing his most valuable effects
about his person, arose with the cock, repaired
to the place, at which he had appointed to meet
the posti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion with the carriage, and set out for
England without further delay; leaving the un∣happy
Zelos to the horrors of indigence, and the
additional agony of this fresh disappointment.
Yet he was not the only person affected by the
abrupt departure of Fathom, which was hasten∣ed
by the importunities, threats and reproaches
of his landlord's daughter, whom he had de∣bauched
under promise of marriage, and now
left in the fourth month of her pregnancy.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the dangerous adventure in
which he had been formerly involved by travel∣ing
in the night, he did not think proper to
make the usual halts on this journey, for sleep
or refreshment, nor did he once quit the
chaise, till his arrival at Boulogne, which he
reached in twenty hours, after his departure from
Paris. Here he thought he might safely indulge
himself with a comfortable meal; accordingly,
he bespoke a poulard for dinner, and while that
was preparing, went forth to view the city and
harbour. When he beheld the white cliffs of
Albion, his heart throbbed with all the joy of a
beloved son, who after a tedious and fatiguing
voyage, reviews the chimneys of his father's
house: he surveyed the neighbouring coast of
England, with fond and longing eyes, like ano∣ther
Moses reconnoitring the land of Canaan
from the top of mount Pisgah: and to such a
<PB N="198" REF="207"/>
degree of impatience was he enflamed by the
sight, that instead of proceeding to Calais, he
resolved to take his passage directly from Bou∣logne,
even if he should hire a vessel for the pur∣pose.
With these sentiments, he inquired if
there was any ship bound for England, and was
so fortunate as to find the master of a small bark,
who intended to weigh anchor for Deal, that
same evening at high water.</P>
<P>Transported with this information, he imme∣diately
agreed for his passage, sold the post∣chaise
to his landlord for thirty guineas, as a
piece of furniture, for which he could have no
further use, purchased a portmanteau, together
with some linen and wearing apparel, and at
the recommendation of his host, took into his
service, an extra-postilion or helper, who had
formerly wore the livery of a travelling marquis.
This new domestic, whose name was Maurice,
underwent with great applause, the examination
of our hero, who perceived in him, a fund of
sagacity and presence of mind, by which he was
excellently qualified for being the valet of an
adventurer; he was therefore accommodated
with a second hand suit, and another shirt, and
at once listed under the banners of count Fa∣thom,
who spent the whole afternoon in giving
him proper instructions for the regulation of his
conduct.</P>
<P>Having settled these preliminaries to his own
satisfaction, he and his baggage were embarked
about six o'clock in the month of September,
and it was not without emotion, that he found
himself benighted upon the great deep, of which,
before the preceding day, he had never enjoyed
even the most distant prospect. However, he
<PB N="199" REF="208"/>
was not a man to be afraid, where there was
really no apppearance of danger; and the agree∣able
presages of future fortune supported his
spirits, amidst the disagreeable nausea which
commonly attends landmen at sea, until he was
set ashore upon the beach at Deal, which he
entered in good health about seven o'clock in the
morning.</P>
<P>Like Caesar, however, he found some diffi∣culty
in landing, on account of the swelling
surf, that tumbled about with such violence, as
had almost overset the cutter that carried him
on shore; and in his eagerness to jump upon
the strand, his foot slipped from the side of the
boat, so that he was thrown forwards in an ho∣rizontal
direction, and his hands were the first
parts of him that touched the English ground.
Upon this occasion, he, in imitation of Scipio's
behaviour on the coast of Afric, hailed the
omen, and grasping an handful of the sand, was
heard to exclaim in the Italian language, “Ah
ha, old England, I have thee fast.”</P>
<P>As he walked up to the inn, followed by Mau∣rice
loaded with his portmanteau, he congratu∣lated
himself upon his happy voyage, and the
peaceable possession of his spoil, and could not
help snuffing up the British air with marks of
infinite relish and satisfaction. His first care was
to recompence himself for the want of sleep he
had undergone, and after he had sufficiently re∣cruited
himself with several hours of uninter∣rupted
repose, he set out in a post-chaise for
Canterbury, where he took a place in the Lon∣don
stage, which, he was told, would depart
next morning, the coach being already full.
On this very first day of his arrival, he perceived
<PB N="200" REF="209"/>
between the English and the people among whom
he had hitherto lived, such essential difference
in customs, appearance, and way of living, as
inspired him with high notions of that British
freedom, opulence, and convenience on which
he had often heard his mother expatiate. On
the road, he feasted his eye-sight with the ver∣dant
hills covered with flocks of sheep, the fruit∣ful
vales parcelled out into cultivated inclosures;
the very cattle seemed to profit by the wealth of
their masters, being large, sturdy and sleek, and
every peasant breathed the insolence of liberty
and independance. In a word, he viewed the
wide extended plains of Kent, with a lover's
eye, and his ambition becoming romantic, could
not help fancying himself another conqueror of
the isle.</P>
<P>He was not, however, long amused by these
vain chimeras, which soon vanished before other
reflections of more importance and solidity.
His imagination, it must be owned, was at all
times too chaste, to admit those over-weening
hopes, which often mislead the mind of a pro∣jector.
He had studied mankind with incredible
diligence, and knew perfectly well how far he
could depend on the passions and foibles of hu∣man
nature. That he might now act consistent
with his former sagacity, he resolved to pass him∣self
upon his fellow travellers, for a French gen∣tleman,
equally a stranger to the language and
country of England, in order to glean from
their discourse, such intelligence as might avail
him in his future operations; and his lacquey
was tutored accordingly.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Some account of his fellow-travellers.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE who had taken places for the
coach, understanding the sixth seat was
engaged by a foreigner, determined to profit by
his ignorance; and with that politeness which is
peculiar to this happy island, fixed themselves in
the vehicle, in such a manner, before he had
the least intimation of their design, that he found
it barely practicable to insinuate himself sidelong
between a corpulent quaker and a fat Wapping∣landlady,
in which attitude he stuck fast, like a
thin quarto between two voluminous dictionaries
on a bookseller's shelf: and as if the pain and
inconvenience of such compression, was not suf∣ficient
matter of chagrin, the greatest part of
the company entertained themselves with laugh∣ing
at his ludicrous station.</P>
<P>The jolly dame at his left hand, observed with
a loud exclamation of mirth, that Monsieur
would be soon better acquainted with a buttock of
English beef; and said by that time they should
arrive at their dining place, he might be spitted
without larding. “Yes, verily,” replied Oba∣diah,
who was a wag in his way, “but the
swine's fat will be all on one side.” “So much
the better for you,” cried mine hostess, “for
that side is all your own.” The quaker was
not so much disconcerted by the quickness of
this repartee, but that he answered with great
deliberation, “I thank thee for thy love, but
will not profit by thy loss; especially as I like
not the savour of these outlandish fowls; they
<PB N="202" REF="211"/>
are profane birds of passage, relished only by the
children of vanity, like thee.”</P>
<P>The plump gentlewoman took umbrage at
this last expression, which she considered as a
double reproach, and repeated the words “Chil∣dren
of vanity!” with an emphasis of resent∣ment.
“I believe, if the truth were known,
said she▪ there's more vanity than midriss, in
that great belly of yours, for all your pretend∣ing
to humility and religion. Sirrah! my cor∣poration
is made up of good, wholsome English
fat; but you are puffed up with the wind of va∣nity
and delusion; and when it begins to gripe
your entrails, you pretend to have a motion,
and then get up and preach nonsense: yet, you'll
take it upon you to call your betters children;
marry come up, Mr. Goose-cap, I have got
children that are as good men as you, or any
hypocritical trembler in England.”</P>
<P>A person who sat opposite to the quaker, hear∣ing
this remonstrance, which seemed pregnant
with contention, interposed in the conversation
with a conscious leer, and begged there might
be no rupture between the spirit and the flesh.
By this remonstrance, he relieved Obadiah from
the satire of this female orator, and brought the
whole vengeance of her elocution upon his own
head. “Flesh: cried she, with all the serocity
of an enraged Thalestris, none of your names,
Mr. Yellow-chaps. What! I warrant you have
an antipathy to flesh, because you yourself are
nothing but skin and bone. I suppose you are
some poor starv'd journeyman taylor come from
France, where you have been learning to cab∣bage,
and have not seen a good meal of victuals
these seven years; you have been living upon
<PB N="203" REF="212"/>
rye-bread and soup maigre, and now you come
over like a walking atomy, with a rat's tail at
your wig, and a tinsy jacket; and so forsooth,
you set up for a gentleman, and pretend to find
fault with a sur-loin of roast beef.”</P>
<P>The gentleman heard this address with admi∣rable
patience, and when she had rung out her
alarm, very coolly replied. “Any thing but
your stinking fish, Madam. Since when, I
pray, have you travelled in stage-coaches, and
left off your old profession of crying oysters in
winter, and rotten mackarel in June? You
was then known by the name of Kate Brawn,
and in good repute among the ale-houses in
Thames-street, till that unlucky amour with the
master of a corn vessel, in which he was unfor∣tunately
detected by his own spouse; but you
seem to have rison by that fall; and I wish you
joy of your present plight: though considering
your education on Bear key, you can give but
a sorry account of yourself.”</P>
<P>The amazon, though neither exhausted nor
dismayed, was really confounded at the temper
and assurance of this antagonist, who had ga∣thered
all these anecdotes from the fertility of
his own invention; after a short pause, how∣ever,
she poured forth a torrent of obloquy suf∣ficient
to overwhelm any person who had not
been used to take up arms against such seas of
trouble; and a dispute ensued, which would have
not only disgraced the best orators on the Thames,
but even have made a figure in the celebration of
the Eleusinian mysteries, during which the Athe∣nian
matrons rallied one another from different
waggons, with that freedom of altercation so
happily preserved in this our age and country.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="213"/>
Such a redundancy of epithets and variety of
metaphors, tropes and figures were uttered between
these well-matched opponents, that an epic bard
would have found his account in listening to
the contest, which, in all probability, would not
have been confined to words; had it not been
interrupted for the sake of a young woman of
an agreeable countenance and modest carriage;
who being shocked at some of their flowers of
speech, and terrified by the menacing looks and
gestures of the sirey featured dame, began to
scream aloud, and beg leave to quit the coach.
Her perturbation put an end to the high debate.
The sixth passenger, who had not opened his
mouth, endeavoured to comfort her with assu∣rances
of protection; the quaker proposed a ces∣sation
of arms; the male disputant acquiesced in
the proposal, assuring the company he had en∣tered
the lists for their entertainment only, with∣out
acquiring the least grudge or ill-will to the
fat gentlewoman, whom he protested he had
never seen before that day, and who, for aught
he knew, was a person of credit and reputation.
He then held forth his hand in token of amity,
and asked pardon of the offended party, who
was appeased by his submission; and in testimony
of her benevolence, presented to the other fe∣male,
whom she had discomposed, an Hungary-water
bottle filled with cherry-brandy, recom∣mending
it as a much more powerful remedy,
than the Sal volatile, which the other held to
her nose.</P>
<P>Peace being thus re-established in a treaty,
comprehending Obadiah and all present, it
will not be improper to give the reader some
further information touching the several charac∣ters
<PB N="205" REF="214"/>
assembled in this vehicle. The quaker was
a London merchant, who had been at Deal,
superintending the repairs of a ship, which had
suffered by a storm in the Downs. The Wap∣ping
landlady, was on her return from the same
place, where she had attended the payment of a
man of war, with sundry powers of attorney,
granted by the sailors, who had lived upon cre∣dit
at her house. Her competitor in fame was
a dealer in wine, a smuggler of French lace,
and a petty gamester just arrived from Paris, in
the company of an English barber who sat on
his right hand, and the young woman was
daughter of a country curate, in her way to
London, where she was bound apprentice to a
milliner.</P>
<P>Hitherto Fathom had sat in silent astonish∣ment
at the manners of his fellow-travellers,
which far exceeded the notions he had pre-con∣ceived
of English plainness and rusticity: he
found himself a monument of that disregard and
contempt, which a stranger never fails to meet
with from the inhabitants of this island; and saw
with surprize, an agreeable young creature sit as
solitary and unheeded as himself. He was, indeed,
allured by the roses of her complexion, and the
innocence of her aspect, and began to repent of
having pretended ignorance of the language, by
which he was restrained from exercising his elo∣quence
upon her heart; he resolved, however,
to ingratiate himself, if possible, by the cour∣tesy
and politeness of dumb shew, and for that
purpose, put his eyes in motion without farther
delay.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="29" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="206" REF="215"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. XXIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Another providential deliverance, from the effects
of the smuggler's ingenious conjecture.</HEAD>
<P>DUring these deliberations, the wine-mer∣chant,
with a view to make a parade of
his superior parts and breeding, as well as to pave
the way for a match at backgammon, made a ten∣der
of his snuff-box to our adventurer, and asked
in bad French, how he travelled from Paris.
This question produced a series of interrogations,
concerning the place of Ferdinand's abode in
that city, and his business in England; so that
he was was fain to practise the science of de∣fence,
and answered with such ambiguity, as ar∣roused
the suspicion of the smuggler, who began
to believe our hero had some very cogent rea∣son,
for evading his curiosity: he immediately
set his reflection at work, and after various con∣jectures,
fixed upon Fathom's being the young
pretender. Big with this supposition, he eyed
him with the most earnest attention, comparing
his features with those of the chevalier's portrait,
which he had seen in France, and though the
faces were as unlike as any two human faces
could be, found the resemblance so striking as
to dispel all his doubts, and persuade him to in∣troduce
the stranger to some Justice on the road:
a step by which he would not only manifest his
zeal for the protestant succession, but also ac∣quire
the spiendid reward proposed by parliament,
to any person who should apprehend that famous
adventurer.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="216"/>
These ideas intoxicated the brain of this man,
to such a pitch of enthusiasm, that he actually
believed himself in possession of the thirty thou∣sand
pounds, and amused his fancy with a variety
of magnificent projects to be executed by means
of that acquisition; until his reverie was inter∣rupted
by the halting of the coach at the inn
where the passengers used to eat their breakfasts.
Waked as he was from the dream of happiness,
it had made such impression upon his mind, that
seeing Fathom rise up with an intention to alight,
he took it for granted his design was to escape,
and seizing him by the collar, called aloud for
assistance, in the king's name.</P>
<P>Our hero, whose sagacity and presence of
mind, very often supplied the place of courage,
instead of being terrified at this assault, which
might have disturbed the tranquillity of an ordi∣nary
villain, was so perfectly master of every
circumstance of his own situation, as to know
at once, that the aggressor could not possibly
have the least cause of complaint against him;
and therefore, imputing this violence either to
madness or mistake, very deliberately suffered
himself to be made prisoner by the people of the
house, who ran to the coach-door, in obedience
to the summons of the wine-merchant. The
rest of the company were struck dumb with
surprize and consternation at this sudden adven∣ture,
and the quaker dreading some fell resist∣ance
on the side of the outlandish-man, unpinned
the other coach door in the twinkling of an eye,
and trundled himself into the mud for safety.
The others seeing the temper and resignation of
the prisoner, soon recovered their recollection,
and began to inquire into the cause of his arrest:
<PB N="208" REF="217"/>
Upon which the captor, whose teeth chattered
with terror and impatience, gave them to un∣derstand
that he was a state criminal, and
demanded their help in conveying him to
justice.</P>
<P>Luckily for both parties, there happened to be
at the inn a company of squires just returned
from the death of a leash of hares, which they
had ordered to be dressed for dinner, and among
these gentlemen was one of the Quorum, to whom
the accuser had immediate recourse, marching
before the captive, who walked very peaceably
between the landlord and one of his waiters,
and followed by a croud of spectators, some of
whom had secured the faithful Maurice, who in
his behaviour, closely imitated the deliberation
of his master. In this order did the procession
advance to the apartment in which the magi∣strate
with his fellows of the chace, fat smoak∣ing
his morning pipe over a tankard of strong¦ale;
and the smuggler being directed to the right
person, “May it please your worship, said he,
I have brought this foreigner before you, on a
violent suspicion of his being a proclaimed out∣law,
and I desire before these witnesses, that
my title may be made good to the reward that
shall become due upon his conviction.”</P>
<P>“Friend, replied the justice, I know no∣thing
of you or your titles, but, this I know,
if you have any information to give in, you
must come to my house when I am at home,
and proceed in a lawful way, that is, d'ye mind
me, if you swear as how this here person is an
outlaw, then if so be as he has nothing to say
to the contrary, my clerk shall make out a mit∣timus;
and so to jail with him till next size.”</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="218"/>
“But Sir,” answered the impeacher, this is a
case that admits of no delay, the person I have
apprehended, is a prisoner of consequence to the
state.” “How! fellor,” cried the magistrate,
interrupting him, “is there any person of more
consequence than one of his majesty's justices
of the peace, who is besides, a considerable
member of the landed interest? d'ye know sirrah,
who you are talking to? if you don't go about
your business, I believe I shall lay you by the
heels.”</P>
<P>The smuggler fearing his prize would escape,
through the ignorance, pride and obstinacy of
this country justice, approached his worship,
and in a whisper, which was overheard by all
the company, assured him, he had indubitable
reason to believe the foreigner was no other than
the pretender's eldest son. At mention of this
formidable name, every individual of the audi∣ence
started, with signs of terror and amaze∣ment.
The justice dropped his pipe, recoiled
upon his chair, and looking most ridiculously
aghast, exclaimed, “Seize him in the name
of God and his majesty king George! has he
got no secret arms about him?”</P>
<P>Fathom being thus informed of the suspicion
under which he stood, could not help smiling
at the eagerness with which the spectators flew
upon him; and suffered himself to be searched
with great composure, well knowing they would
find no moveables about his person, but such as
upon examination, would turn to his account;
he, therefore, very calmly presented to the ma∣gistrate
his purse, and a small box that contain∣ed
his jewels, and in the French language, de∣sired
they might be preserved from the hands of
<PB N="210" REF="219"/>
the mob. This request was interpreted by the
accuser, who at the same time, laid claim to the
booty; the justice took charge of the deposit,
and one of his neighbours having undertaken the
office of clerk, he proceeded to the examination
of the culprit, whose papers were by this time
laid on the table before him. “Stranger, said
he, you stand charged with being son of the
pretender to these realms: what have you to say
in your own defence?” Our hero assured him
in the French language that he was falsly im∣peached,
and demanded justice on the accuser,
who without the least reason, had made such a
malicious attack upon the life and honour of an
innocent gentleman.</P>
<P>The smuggler, instead of acting the part of a
faithful interpreter, told his worship that the
prisoner's answer was no more than a simple de∣nial,
which every felon would make, who had
nothing else to plead in his own behalf; and that
this alone was a strong presumption of his guilt;
because, if he was not really the person they sus∣pected
him to be, the thing would speak for it∣self:
for, if he was not the young pretender,
who then was he?” This argument had great
weight with the justice, who assuming a very
important aspect, observed, “Very true, friend,
if you are not the pretender, in the name of
God who are you? one may see with half an
eye, that he is no better than a promiscuous
fellow.”</P>
<P>Ferdinand now began to repent of having
pretended ignorance of the English language,
as he found himself at the mercy of a rascal,
who put a false gloss upon all his words; and
addressed himself to the audience successively in
<PB N="211" REF="220"/>
French, High-Dutch, Italian, and Hungarian
Latin, desiring to know if any person present
understood any of these tongues, that his answers
might be honestly explained to the bench. But,
he might have accosted them in Chinese with
the same success: there was not one person pre∣sent
tolerably versed in his mother tongue, much
less acquainted with any foreign language, ex∣cept
the wine-merchant, who incensed at this
appeal, which he considered as an affront to his
integrity, gave the judge to understand that the
delinquent, instead of speaking to the purpose,
contumaciously insulted his authority, in sundry
foreign lingo's, which he apprehended, was an
additional proof of his being the chevalier's son,
inasmuch, as no person would take the pains to
learn such a variety of gibberish, except with some
finister intent.</P>
<P>This annotation was not lost upon the squire,
who was too jealous of the honour of his office,
to overlook such a flagrant instance of contempt.
His eyes glistened, his cheeks were inflated with
rage: “The case is plain,” said he, “having
nothing of signification to offer in his own fa∣vour,
he grows refectory, and abuses the court
in his base Roman catholic jargon: but I'll let
you know, for all you pretend to be a prince,
you are no better than an outlawed vagrant; and
I'll shew you what a thing you are, when you
come in composition with an English justice like
me, who have more than once extinguished my∣self
in the service of my country. As nothing
else accrues, your purse, black box and papers
shall be sealed up before witnesses, and sent by
express to one of his majesty's secretaries of
state; and as for yourself, I will apply to the
<PB N="212" REF="221"/>
military at Canterbury, for a guard to conduct
you to London.”</P>
<P>This was a very unwelcome declaration to
our adventurer, who was on the point of har∣ranguing
the justice and spectators in their own
language, when he was relieved from the neces∣sity
of taking that step, by the interposition of a
young nobleman just arrived at the inn, who
being informed of this strange examination, en∣tered
the court, and at first sight of the prisoner,
assured the justice he was imposed upon; for,
that he himself had often seen the young Pre∣tender
in Paris, and that there was no kind of
resemblance between that adventurer and the
person now before him. The accuser was not
a little mortified at his lordship's affirmation,
which met with all due regard from the bench;
though the magistrate took notice that granting
the prisoner was not the young chevalier him∣self,
it was highly probable, he was an emissary
of that house, as he could give no satisfactory
account of himself, and was possessed of things
of such value as no honest man would expose to
the accidents of the road.</P>
<P>Fathom having thus found an interpreter, who
signified to him in the French tongue, the doubts
of the justice, told his lordship that he was a
gentleman of a noble house in Germany, who
for certain reasons, had come abroad incognito,
with a view to see the world; and that although
the letters they had seised, would prove the
truth of that assertion, he should be loth to ex∣pose
his private concerns to the knowledge of
strangers, if he could possibly be released with∣out
that mortification. The young nobleman
explained his desire to the court; but, his own
<PB N="213" REF="222"/>
curiosity being interested, observed at the same
time, that the justice could not be said to have
discharged the duty of his station, until he should
have examined every circumstance relating to
the prisoner: upon which remonstrance, he was
requested by the bench to peruse the papers, and
accordingly communicated the substance of one
letter, to this effect.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>“My dear son,</OPENER>
<P>Though I am far from approving the rash
step you have taken in withdrawing yourself
from your father's house, in order to avoid an
engagement, which would have been equally
honourable and advantageous to your family,
I cannot so far suppress my affection, as to
bear the thought of your undergoing those
hardships, which for your disobedience, you
deserve to suffer. I have therefore, without
the knowledge of your father, sent the bearer
to attend you in your peregrinations; his fide∣lity
you know hath been tried in a long course
of service, and I have entrusted to his care
for your use, a purse of two hundred ducats,
and a box of jewels to the value of twice that
sum, which though not sufficient to support
an equipage suitable to your birth, will, at
least for some time, preserve you from the
importunities of want. When you are du∣tiful
enough to explain your designs and situa∣tion,
you may expect further indulgence from
your too tender and disconsolate mother,</P>
<CLOSER>The countess of Fathom.”</CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="214" REF="223"/>
This letter, which, as well as the others, our
hero had forged for the purpose, effectually an∣swered
his intent, in throwing dust in the eyes
and understanding of the spectators, who now
regarded the prisoner with looks of respectful re∣morse,
as a man of quality who had been falsly
accused: his lordship to make a parade of his
own politeness and importance, assured the
bench, he was no stranger to the family of the
Fathoms, and with a compliment, gave Ferdi∣nand
to understand he had formerly seen him at
Versailles. There being no longer room for
suspicion, the justice ordered our adventurer to
be set at liberty, and even invited him to be seated,
with an apology for the rude manner in which
he had been treated, owing to the misinforma∣tion
of the accuser, who was threatned with the
stocks for his malice and presumption.</P>
<P>But, this was not the only triumph our hero
obtained over the wine-merchant. Maurice was
no sooner unfettered, than advancing into the
middle of the room; “My lord, (said he, ad∣dressing
himself in French, to his master's deli∣verer,)
since you have been so generous as to
protect a noble stranger from the danger of such
a false accusation, I hope you will still lay an
additional obligation upon the count, by retort∣ing
the vengeance of the law upon his perfidious
accuser, whom I know to be a trader in those
articles of merchandize, which are prohibited by
the ordonnances of this nation. I have seen
him lately at Bullogne, and am perfectly well
acquainted with some persons who have supplied
him with French lace and embroidery; and as
a proof of what I alledge, I desire you will or∣der
<PB N="215" REF="224"/>
him and this barber, who is his understrap∣per,
to be examined on the spot.”</P>
<P>This charge, which was immediately explain∣ed
to the bench, yielded extraordinary satisfaction
to the spectators, one of whom, being an officer
of the customs, forthwith began to exercise his
function upon the unlucky Perruquier, who be∣ing
stripped of his upper garments, and even of
his shirt, appeared like the mummy of an Aegyp∣tian
king, most curiously rolled up in bandages
of rich, figured gold shalloon, that covered the
skirts of four embroidered waistcoats. The
merchant seeing his expectation so unhappily re∣versed,
made an effort to retire with a most rue∣sul
aspect; but was prevented by the officer, who
demanded the interposition of the civil power,
that he might undergo the same examination,
to which the other had been subjected. He
was accordingly rifled without loss of time, and
the enquiry proved well worth the care of him
who made it; for, a considerable booty of the
same sort of merchandize was found in his boots,
breeches, hat, and between the buckram and
lining of his surtout. Yet not contented with
this prize, the experienced spoiler proceeded to
search his baggage, and perceiving a false bot∣tom
in his portmanteau, detected beneath it a
valuable accession to the plunder he had already
obtained.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The singular manner of Fathom's attack and tri∣umph
over the virtue of the fair Elenor.</HEAD>
<P>PRoper cognizance being thus taken of these
contraband effects, and the informer fur∣nished
with a certificate by which he was intitled
to a share of the seizure, the coachman sum∣moned
his passengers to the carriage; the purse
and jewels were restored to count Fathom, who
thanked the justice, and his lordship in particular,
for the candour and hospitality with which he
had been treated, and resumed his place in the
vehicle, amidst the congratulations of all his fel∣low
travellers, except the two sorlorn smugglers,
who instead of reimbarking in the coach, thought
proper to remain at the inn, with a view to mi∣tigate,
if possible, the severity of their mis∣fortune.</P>
<P>Among those who felicitated Fathom upon
the issue of this adventure, the young maiden
seemed to express the most sensible pleasure at
that event. The artful language of his eyes had
raised in her breast certain fluttering emotions,
before she knew the value of her conquest; but
now that his rank and condition were discovered,
these transports were increased by the ideas of
vanity and ambition which are mingled with the
first seeds of every female constitution. The
belief of having captivated the heart of a man
who could raise her to the rank and dignity of a
countess, produced such agreeable sensations in
her fancy, that her eyes shone with unusual lustre,
and a continual smile played in dimples, on her
<PB N="217" REF="226"/>
rosy cheeks; so that her attractions, though not
powerful enough to engage the affection, were
yet sufficient to inflame the desire of our adven∣turer,
who very honestly marked her chastity
for prey to his voluptuous passion. Had she
been well seasoned with knowledge and experi∣ence,
and compleatly armed with caution against
the artifice and villainy of man, her virtue
might not have been able to withstand the en∣gines
of such an assailant, considering the
dangerous opportunities to which she was ne∣cessarily
exposed: how easy then must his victory
have been over an innocent, unsuspecting coun∣try
damsel, flushed with the warmth of youth,
and an utter stranger to the ways of life.</P>
<P>While Obadiah, therefore, and his plump
companion were engaged in conversation, on
the strange incidents which had passed, Fathom
acted a very expressive pantomime with this fair
buxom nymph, who comprehended his meaning
with surprizing facility, and was at so little pains
to conceal the pleasure the took in this kind of
intercourse, that several warm squeezes were in∣terchanged
between her and her lover, before they
arrived at Rochester, where they proposed to dine.
It was during this period, he learned from the
answers she made to the inquisitive quaker, that
her sole dependance was upon a relation, to
whom she had a letter, and that she was a per∣fect
stranger in the great city; circumstances
on which he soon formed the project of her
ruin.</P>
<P>Upon their arrival at the Black Bull, he for
the first time found himself alone with his Aman∣da,
whose name was Elenor, their fellow-tra∣vellers
being elsewhere employed about their own
<PB N="218" REF="227"/>
concerns; and unwilling to lose the precious
opportunity, he began to act the part of a very im∣portunate
lover, which he conceived to be a
proper sequel to the prelude, which had been
performed in the coach. The freedoms that
she, out of pure simplicity and good humour,
permitted him to take with her hand, and even
her rosy lips, encouraged him to practise other
familiarities upon her fair bosom, which scanda∣lized
her virtue so much, that in spite of the
passion she had begun to indulge in his behalf,
she rejected his advances with all the marks of
anger and disdain; and he found it necessary to
appease the storm he had raised, by the most
respectful and submissive demeanour; resolving
to change his operations, and carry on his at∣tacks,
so as to make her yield at discretion,
without alarming her religion or pride. Ac∣cordingly,
when the bill was called after dinner,
he took particular notice of her behaviour, and
perceiving her pull out a large leathern purse
that contained her money, reconnoitred the
pocket in which it was deposited, and while they
sat close to each other in the carriage, conveyed
it with admirable dexterity into an hole in the
cushion. Whether the corpulent couple, who
sat opposite to these lovers, had entered into an
amorous engagement at the inn, or were seve∣rally
induced by other motives, is uncertain;
but, sure it is, both left the coach on that part
of the road which lies nearest to Gravesend,
and bad adieu to the other pair, on pretence of
having urgent business at that place.</P>
<P>Ferdinand, not a little pleased at their depar∣ture,
renewed his most pathetic expressions of
love, and sung several French songs on that ten∣der
<PB N="219" REF="228"/>
subject, which seemed to thrill to the so I of
his beauteous Helen. While the driver halted
at Dartford to water his horses, she was fruit
with the appearance of some cheesecakes, which
were presented by the landlady of the house,
and having bargained for two or three, put her
hand in her pocket, in order to pay for her pur∣chase;
but what was her astonishment, when af∣ter
having rummaged her equipage, she under∣stood
her whole fortune was lost! This mi∣shap
was by a loud shriek announced to our hero,
who affected infinite amazement and concern;
and no sooner learned the cause of her affliction,
than he presented her with his own purse, from
which he, in emphatic dumb shew, begged she
would indemnify herself for the damage she had
sustained. Although this kind proffer was some
alleviation of her misfortune, she did not fail to
pour forth a most piteous lamentation, importing
that she had not only lost all her money, amount∣ing
to five pounds, but also her letter of recom∣mendation
upon which she had altogether relied
for present employment.</P>
<P>The vehicle was minutely searched from top
to bottom, by herself and our adventurer, aslist∣ed
by Maurice, and the coachman, who finding
their inquiry ineffectual, did not scruple to de∣clare
his suspicion of the two fat turtles who
had deserted the coach in such an abrupt man∣ner.
In a word, he rendered this conjecture so
plausible, by wresting the circumstances of their
behaviour and retreat, that poor Elenor impli∣citly
believed they were the thieves by whom
she had suffered; and was prevailed upon to ac∣cept
the proffered assistance of the generous
count, who seeing her very much disordered by
<PB N="220" REF="229"/>
this mischance, insisted upon her drinking a large
glass of Canary to quiet the perturbation of her
spirits. This is a season, which of all others, is
most propitious to the attempts of an artful lover;
and justifies the metaphorical maxim of fishing
in troubled waters. There is an affinity and
short transition betwixt all the violent passions
that agitate the human mind: they are all false
perspectives, which though they magnify, yet
perplex and render indistinct every object which
they represent: and flattery is never so success∣fully
administred, as to those who know they
stand in need of friendship, assent and appro∣bation.</P>
<P>The cordial she swallowed, far srem calming,
increased the disturbance of her thoughts, and
produced an intoxication; during which, she
talked in an incoherent strain, laughed and wept
by turns, and acted other extravagancies, which
are known to be symptoms of the hysterical
affection. Fathom, though an utter stranger to
the sentiments of honour, pity and remorse,
would not perpetrate his vitious purpose, though
favoured by the delirium his villainy had intailed
upon this unfortunate young maiden; because
his appetite demanded a more perfect sacrifice,
than that which she could yield in her present
deplorable situation, when her will must have
been altogether unconcerned in his success.
Determined therefore, to make a conquest of
her virtue, before he would take possession of
her person, he mimicked that compassion and be∣nevolence,
which his heart had never felt, and
when the coach arrived at London, not only
discharged what she owed for her place, but like
wise, procured for her an apartment in the
<PB N="221" REF="230"/>
house, to which he himself had been directed
for lodgings, and even hired a nurse to attend
her, during a severe sever, which was the con∣sequence
of her disappointment and despondence.
Indeed she was supplied with all necessaries by
the generosity of this noble count, who for the
interest of his passion, and the honour of his
name, was resolved to extend his charity to the
last farthing of her own money, which he had
been wise enough to secure for this purpose.</P>
<P>Her youth soon got the better of her distem∣per,
and when she understood her obligations to
the count, who did not fail to attend her in
person with great tenderness, her heart, which
had been before prepossessed in his favour, now
glowed with all the warmth of gratitude, esteem
and affection. She knew herself in a strange
place, destitute of all resource but in his gene∣rosity:
she loved his person, she was dazzled by
his rank; and he knew so well how to improve
the opportunities and advantages he derived from
her unhappy situation, that he gradually pro∣ceeded
in sapping from one degree of intimacy
to another, until all the bulwarks of her chastity
were undermined, and she submitted to his de∣sire;
not with the reluctance of a vanquished
people, but with all the transports of a joyful
city, that opens its gates to receive a darling
prince, returned from conquest: for, by this
time, he had artfully concentred and kindled up,
all the inflammable ingredients of her constitu∣tion;
and she now looked back upon the vir∣tuous
principles of her education, as upon a
disagreeable and tedious dream, from which she
had waked to the fruition of never-fading joy.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He by accident encounters his old friend, with
whom be holds a conference, and renews a
treaty.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Hero having thus provided him∣self
with a proper subject for his hours
of dalliance, thought it was now high
time to study the ground which he had
pitched upon for the scene of his exploits,
and with that view made several excursions to
different parts of the town, where there was
ought of entertainment or instruction to be
found: yet he always, on these occasions, ap∣peared
in an obscure ordinary dress, in order to
avoid singularity, and never went twice to the
same coffee-house, that his person might not be
afterwards known, in case he should shine forth
to the public, in a superior sphere. On his re∣turn
from one of these expeditions, while he
was passing through Ludgate, his eyes were
suddenly encountered, by the apparition of his
old friend the Tyroleze, who perceiving himself
fairly caught in the toil, made a virtue of ne∣cessity,
and running up to our adventurer with
an aspect of eagerness and joy, clasped him in
his arms, as some dear friend, whom he had
casually found after a most tedious and disagree∣able
separation.</P>
<P>Fathom, whose genius never failed him in such
emergencies, far from receiving these advances
with the threats and reproaches which the other
had deserved at his hands, returned the salute
with equal warmth, and was really over-joyed
<PB N="223" REF="232"/>
at meeting with a person, who might one way
or other make amends for the perfidy of his
former conduct. The Tyroleze, whose name
was Ratchkali, pleased with his reception, pro∣posed
they should adjourn to the next tavern,
in which they had no sooner taken possession of
an apartment, than he addressed himself to his
old companion in these words.</P>
<P>“Mr. Fathom, by your frank and obliging
manner of treating a man who hath done you
wrong, I am more and more confirmed in my
opinion of your sagacity, which I have often
considered with admiration: I will not therefore,
attempt to make an apology for my conduct at
our last parting; but only assure you that this
meeting may turn out to our mutual advantage,
if we now re-enter into an unreserved union,
the ties of which we will soon find it our inte∣rest
and inclination to preserve. For my own
part, as my judgment is ripened by experience, so
are my sentiments changed since our last associa∣tion.
I have seen many a rich harvest lost, for
want of a fellow-labourer in the vineyard; and
I have more than once fallen a sacrifice to a
combination, which I could have resisted with
the help of one able auxiliary. Indeed I might
prove what I alledge by mathematical demon∣stration;
and I believe no body will pretend to
deny, that two heads are better than one, in
all cases that require discernment and delibe∣ration.”</P>
<P>Ferdinand could not help owning the sanity of
his observations, and forthwith acquiesced in his
proposal of the new alliance; desiring to know
the character in which he acted in the English
stage, and the scheme he would offer for their
<PB N="224" REF="233"/>
mutual emolument: at the same time he resolved
within himself, to keep such a strict eye over
his future actions, as would frustrate any design,
he might hereafter harbour, of repeating the
prank he had so successfully played upon him, in
their journey from the banks of the Rhine.</P>
<P>“Having quitted you at Bar le duc, resumed
the Tyroleze, I travelled without ceasing, until
I arrived at Francksort upon the Maine, where
I assumed the character of a French chevalier,
and struck some masterly strokes, which you
yourself would not have deemed unworthy of
your invention; and my success was the more
agreeable, as my operations were chiefly carried
on against the enemies of our religion: but my
prosperity was not of long duration. Seeing
they could not foil me at my own weapons, they
formed a damned conspiracy, by which I not
only lost all the fruits of my industry, but like∣wise
ran the most imminent hazard of my life.
I had ordered some of those jewels which I had
borrowed of my good friend Fathom, to be new
set in a fashionable taste, and soon after had an
opportunity to sell one of these at a great advan∣tage,
to one of the fraternity, who offered an
extraordinary price for the stone, on purpose to
effect my r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in. In less than four and twenty
hours after this bargain, I was arrested by the
officers of justice, upon the oath of the pur∣chaser,
who undertook to prove me guilty of a
fraud, in selling a Saxon pebble for a real dia∣mond;
and this accusation was actually true;
for the change had been artfully put upon me,
by the jeweller, who was himself engaged in
the conspiracy.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="234"/>
Had my conscience been clear of any other
impeachment, perhaps, I should have rested my
cause upon the equity and protection of the law;
but, I foresaw that the trial would introduce
an inquiry, to which I was not at all ambitious
of submitting, and therefore was fain to com∣promise
the affair, at the price of almost my
whole fortune. Yet, this accommodation was
not made so secretly, but that my character was
blasted, and my credit overthrown; so that I
was fain to relinquish my occasional equipage,
and hire myself as journeyman to a lapidary,
an employment which I had exercised in my
youth. In this obscure station, I laboured with
great assiduity, until I made myself perfect in
the knowledge of stones, as well as in the diffe∣rent
methods of setting them off to the best ad∣vantage;
and having, by dint of industry and
address, got possession of a small parcel, set out
for this kingdom, in which I happily arrived
about four months ago; and surely England is
the paradise of artists of our profession.</P>
<P>One would imagine, that nature had created
the inhabitants, for the support and enjoyment of
adventurers like you and me. Not that these
islanders open the arms of hospitality to all
foreigners without distinction: on the contrary,
they inherit from their fathers, an unreasonable
prejudice against all nations under the sun; and
when an Englishman happens to quarrel with a
stranger, the first term of reproach he uses, is
the name of his antagonist's country, charac∣terized
by some opprobrious epithet; such as a
chattering Frenchman, an Italian ape, a German
hog, and a beastly Dutchman; nay, their national
prepossession is maintained even against those
<PB N="226" REF="235"/>
people with whom they are united, under the
same laws and government; for, nothing is
more common th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to hear them exclaim against
their fellow subjects, in the expressions of a beg∣garly
Scot, and an impudent Irish bog-trotter.
Yet, this very prejudice will never fail to turn
to the account of every stranger possessed of or∣dinary
talents; for he will always find opportu∣nities
of conversing with them in Coffee-houses,
and places of public resort, in spite of their
prosessed reserve, which, by the bye, is so ex∣traordinary,
that I know some people who have
lived twenty years in the same house, without
exchanging one word with their next door
neighbours; yet, provided he can talk sensibly,
and preserve the deportment of a sober gentle∣man,
in those occasional conversations, his beha∣viour
will be the more remarkably pleasing, as it
will agreeably disappoint the expectation of the
person, who had entertained notions to his
prejudice. When a foreigner has once crossed
this bar, which perpetually occurs, he fails with∣out
further difficulty into the harbour of an
Englishman's good will; for the pique is neither
personal nor rancorous, but rather contemptu∣ous
and national; so that while he despifes a
people in the lump, an individual of that very
community, may be one of his chief fa∣vourites.</P>
<P>The English are in general upright and ho∣nest,
therefore unsuspecting and credulous: they
are too much engrossed with their own business,
to pry into the conduct of their neighbours,
and too indifferent, in point of disposition, to
interest themselves, in what they conceive to be
foreign to their own concerns. They are
<PB N="227" REF="236"/>
wealthy and mercantile, of consequence liberal
and adventurous, and so well disposed to take a
man's own word for his importance, that they
suffer themselves to be preyed upon by such a
bungling set of impostors, as would starve for
lack of address, in any other country under the
sun. This being a true sketch of the British
character, so far as I have been able to observe
and learn, you will easily comprehend the profits
that may be extracted from it, by virtue of those
arts by which you so eminently excel; <HI>the great
the unbounded prospect lies before me!</HI> Indeed, I
look upon this opulent kingdom, as a wide and
fertile common, on which we adventurers may
range for prey, without let or molestation: for
so jealous are the natives of their liberty, that
they will not bear the restraint of necessary <HI>Po∣lice,</HI>
and an able artist may enrich himself with
their spoils, without running any risque of at∣tracting
the notice of the magistrate, or incur∣ing
the least penalty of the law.</P>
<P>In a word, this metropolis is a vast masquerad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
in which a man of stratagem may wear a thou∣sand
different disguises, without danger of de∣tection.
There is a variety of shapes, in which
we knights of the industry, make our appearance
in London. One glides into a nobleman's house
in the capacity of a valet de chambre, and in a
few months lea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the whole family by the nose.
Another exhibits himself to the public, as an
empirie or operator for the teeth; and by din<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of assurance and affidavits, bearing testimony to
wonderful cures that never were performed,
whirls himself into his chariot, and lays the
town under contribution: a third professes the
composition of musick, as well as the perform∣ance,
<PB N="228" REF="237"/>
and by means of a few <HI>Capriciosos</HI> on the
violin, properly introduced, wriggles himself into
the management of private and public concerts:
and a fourth breaks forth at once in all the splen∣dor
of a gay equipage, under the title and deno∣mination
of a foreign count. Not to mention
those inferior projectors, who assume the cha∣racters
of dancers, fencing-masters, and French
ushers, or by renouncing their religion, seek to
obtain a provision for life.</P>
<P>Either of these parts will turn to the account
of an able actor; and as you are equally quali∣fied
for all, you may choose that which is most
suitable to your own inclination: though in my
opinion, you was designed by nature, to shine
in the great world, which, after all, is the most
ample field, for men of genius; because the
game is deeper, and people of fashion being,
for the most part, more ignorant, indolent,
vain and capricious than their inferiors, are of
consequence more easily deceived; besides their
morals fit generally so loose about them, that
when a gentleman of our fraternity is discovered
in the exercise of his profession, their contempt
of his skill is the only disgrace he incurs.”</P>
<P>Our hero was so well pleased with this pic∣ture,
that he longed to peruse the original, and
before these two friends parted, they settled all
the operations of the campaign. Ratchkali,
that same evening, hired magnificent lodgings
for count Fathom, in the court end of the
town, and furnished his wardrobe and liveries
from the spoils of Monmouth-street; he like∣wise
enlisted another footman and valet de cham∣bre
into his service, and sent to the apartments
divers large trunks, supposed to be filled with
<PB N="229" REF="238"/>
the baggage of this foreign nobleman, though
in reality, they contained little else than com∣mon
lumber.</P>
<P>Next day, our adventurer took possession of
his new habitation, after having left to his friend
and associate the task of dismissing the unfortu∣nate
Ellenor, who was so shocked at the unex∣pected
message, that she fainted away; and when
she recovered the use of her senses, so well as
to reflect upon her forlorn condition, she was
seized with the most violent transports of grief
and dismay, by which her brain was disordered
to such a degree, that she grew furious and dis∣tracted,
and was by the advice and assistance of
the Tyroleze, conveyed into the hospital of
Bethlem; where we shall leave her for the pre∣sent,
happily berest of her reason.</P>

<P>MEAN while, Fathom and his engine
were busied in compleating his equipage,
so that in a few days, he had procured a very
gay chariot, adorned with painting, gilding and
a coat of arms according to his own fancy and

insinuating manners and agreeable conversation.
He had thought proper to tell the nobleman at
their first interview in town, that his reasons
for concealing his knowledge of the English
tongue were now removed, and that he would
no longer deny himself the pleasure of speaking
a language which had been always musick to his
ear: he had also thanked his lordship for his ge∣nerous
interposition at the inn, which was an
instance of that generosity and true politeness,
which are engrossed by the English people, who
leave nought to other nations but the meer sha∣dow
of these virtues.</P>
<P>A testimony like this, from the mouth of
such a noble stranger, won the heart of the
peer, who professed a friendship for him on the
spot, and undertook to see justice done to his
lacquey, who in a short time was gratified with
a share of the seisure which had been made up∣on
his information, amounting to fifty or sixty
pounds.</P>
<P>Ferdinand put not forth the whole strength of
his accomplishments at once, but contrived to
spring a new mine of qualification every day, to
the surprize and admiration of all his acquain∣tance.
He was gifted with a sort of elocution,
much more specious than solid, and spoke on
every subject that occurred in conversation, with
that familiarity and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which, one would
think, could only be acquired by long study and
application. This plausibility and confidence,
are faculties really inherited from nature, and
<PB N="231" REF="240"/>
effectually serve the possessor, in lieu of that
learning, which is not to be obtained without
infinite toil and perseverance: the most superfi∣cial
tincture of the arts and sciences in such a
juggler, is sufficient to dazzle the understanding
of half mankind; and if managed with circum∣spection,
will enable him even to spend his
life among the literati, without once forfeiting
the character of a connoisseur.</P>
<P>Our hero was perfectly master of this leger∣demain,
which he carried to such a pitch of as∣surance,
as to declare in the midst of a mathe∣matical
assembly, that he intended to gratify
the publick with a full confutation of Sir Isaac
Newton's philosophy, to the nature of which he
was as much a stranger as the most savage Hot∣tentot
in Afric. His pretensions to profound
and universal knowledge, were supported not
only by this kind of presumption, but also by
the facility with which he spoke so many diffe∣rent
languages, and the shrewd remarks he had
made in the course of his travels and observa∣tion.</P>
<P>Among politicians, he settled the balance of
power upon a certain footing, by dint of inge∣nious
schemes, which he had contrived for the
welfare of Europe. With officers, he reformed
the art of war, with improvements which had
occurred to his reflection, while he was engaged
in a military life. He sometimes held forth up∣on
painting, like a member of the <HI>Dillettanti</HI>
club: the theory of musick was a theme upon
which he seemed to expatiate with particular
pleasure: in the provinces of love and gallantry,
he was a perfect Oroondates: he possessed a most
agreeable manner of telling entertaining stories,
<PB N="232" REF="241"/>
of which he had a large collection: he sung
with great melody and taste, and played upon
the violin with surprizing execution. To these
qualifications, let us add his affability and pliant
disposition, and then the reader will not wonder
that he was looked upon as the pattern of human
perfection, and his acquaintance courted accord∣ingly.</P>
<P>While he thus captivated the favour and af∣fection
of the English nobility, he did not neg∣lect
to take other measures in behalf of the part∣nership
to which he had subscribed. This ad∣venture
with the two squires at Paris, had
weakened his appetite for play, which was not
at all restored by the observations he had made
in London, where the art of gaming is reduced
into a regular system, and its professors so lau∣dably
devoted to the discharge of their functions,
as to observe the most temperate regimen, lest
their invention should be impaired by the fatigue
of watching or exercise, and their ideas disturb∣ed
by the sumes of indigestion. No Indian
Brachman could live more abstemious than two
of the pack, who hunted in couple, and ken∣nelled
in the upper apartments of the hotel in
which our adventurer lived: they abstained from
animal food with the abhorrence of Pythagore∣ans,
their drink was the pure, simple element,
they were vomited once a week, took physic or
a glyster every third day, spent the forenoon in
algebraical calculations, and slept from four o'clock
till midnight, that they might then take the
field with that cool fertility which is the effect
of refreshment and repose.</P>
<P>These were terms upon which our hero would
not risque his fortune; he was too much addict∣ed
<PB N="233" REF="242"/>
to pleasure to forego every other enjoyment
but that of amassing; and did not so much de∣pend
upon his dexterity in play, as upon his
talent of insinuation, which by this time, had
succeeded so far beyond his expectation, that
he began to indulge the hope of enslaving the
heart of some rich heiress, whose fortune would
at once raise him above all dependance. Indeed
no man ever set out with a fairer prospect on
such an expedition; for, he had found means
to render himself so agreeable to the fair sex,
that like the boxes of the playhouse, during the
representation of a new performance, his com∣pany
was often bespoke for a series of weeks;
and no lady, whether widow, wife or maiden,
ever mentioned his name, without some epithet
of esteem or affection; such as <HI>the dear Count!
the charming Man! the Nonpareil!</HI> or <HI>the
Angel!</HI></P>
<P>While he thus shone in the zenith of admira∣tion,
it is not to be doubted, that he could have
melted some wealthy dowager or opulent ward:
but being an enemy to all precipitate engage∣ments,
he resolved to act with great care and
deliberation in an affair of such importance, es∣pccially
as he did not find himself hurried by
the importunities of want: for, since his arrival
in England, he had rather increased than ex∣hausted
his finances, by methods equally cer∣tain
and secure. In a word, he with the assist∣ance
of Ratchkali carried on a traffick, which
yielded great profits, without subjecting the tra∣der
to the least loss or inconvenience. Fathom,
for example, wore upon his finger a large bril∣liant,
which he played to such advantage one
night, at a certain nobleman's house, where he
<PB N="234" REF="243"/>
was prevailed upon to entertain the company
with a solo on the violin, that every body pre∣sent
took notice of it's uncommon lustie, and
it was handed about for the perusal of every indi∣vidual.
The water and the workmanship were
universally admired; and one among the rest,
having expressed a desire of knowing the value
of such a jewel, the count seized that opportu∣nity
of entertaining them with a learned disqui∣sition
into the nature of stones; this introduced
the history of the diamond in question, which
he said had been purchased of an Indian trader
of Fort St. George, at an under price; so that
the present proprietor could afford to sell it at
a very reasonable rate; and concluded with tell∣ing
the company, that for his own part, he had
been importuned to wear it, by the jeweller,
who imagined it would have a better chance for
attracting a purchaser on his singer, than while
it remained in his own custody.</P>
<P>This declaration was no sooner made, than
a certain lady of quality, bespoke the refuse of
the jewel, and desired Ferdinand to send the
owner next day to her house, where he accord∣ingly
waited upon her ladyship with the ring,
for which he received one hundred and fifty
guineas, two thirds of the sum being clear gain,
and equally divided betwixt the associates. Nor
was this bargain such as reflected dishonour upon
the lady's taste, or could be productive of ill
consequences to the merchant: for the method
of estimating diamonds is altogether arbitrary;
and Ratchkali, who was an exquisite lapidary,
had set it in such a manner as would have im∣posed
upon any ordinary jeweller. By these
means of introduction, the Tyroleze soon mono∣polized
<PB N="235" REF="244"/>
the custom of a great many noble fami∣les,
upon which he levied large contributions,
without incurring the least suspicion of deceit:
he every day out of pure esteem and gratitude
for the honour of their commands, entertained
them with the sight of some new trinket, which
he was never permitted to carry home, unsold;
and from the profits of each job, a tax was raised
for the benefit of our adventurer.</P>
<P>Yet his indultos were not confined to the arti∣cle
of jewels, which constituted only one part
of his revenue: by the industry of his under∣strapper,
he procured a number of old crazy
fiddles, which were thrown aside as lumber;
upon which he counterfeited the Cremona mark,
and otherwise cook'd them up with great dex∣terity;
so that when he had occasion to regale
the lovers of musick, he would send for one of
these vamped instruments, and extract from it
such tones as quite ravished the hearers; among
whom there was always some conceited preten∣der,
who spoke in raptures of the violin, and
gave our hero an opportunity of launching out
in its praise, and declaring it was the best Cre∣mona
he had ever touched. This encomium
never failed to inflame the desires of the audience,
to some one of whom, he was generous enough
to part with it at prime cost, that is, for twenty
or thirty guineas clear profit; for he was often
able to oblige his friends in this manner, be∣cause,
being an eminent connoisseur, his coun∣tenance
was solicited by all the musicians, who
wanted to dispose of such moveables.</P>
<P>Nor did he neglect the other resources of a
skilful virtuoso. Every auction afforded some
picture, in which, though it had been over-looked
<PB N="236" REF="245"/>
by the ignorance of the times, he recognized
the stile of a great master, and made a merit of
recommending it to some noble friend. This
commerce he likewise extended to medals,
bronzes, busts, intaglios and old china, and kept
divers artificers continually employed in making
antiques for the English nobility. Thus he went
on with such rapidity of success in all his endea∣vours,
that he himself was astonished at the in∣fatuation
he had produced. Nothing was so
wretched among the productions of art, that he
could not impose upon the world as a capital
performance, and so fascinated were the eyes of
his admirers, he could easily have persuaded them
that a barber's bason was an Etrurian Patera,
and the cover of a copper pot, no other than
the shield of Ancus Martius. In short, it was
become so fashionable to consult the count in
every thing relating to taste and politeness, that
not a plan was drawn, not even an house fur∣nished
without his advice and approbation; nay,
to such a degree did his reputation in these mat∣ters
excel, that a particular pattern of paper∣hangings
was known by the name of Fathom;
and his hall was every morning crouded with
upholsterers and other tradesmen, who came by
order of their employers, to learn his choice,
and take his directions.</P>
<P>The character and influence he thus acquired
he took care to maintain with the utmost ass∣duity
and circumspection: he never failed to ap∣pear
the chief personage at all public diversions,
and private assemblies, not only in conversation
and dress, but also in the article of dancing, in
which he outstripped all his fellows, as far as in
every other genteel accomplishment.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">He attracts the envy and ill offices of the minor
knights of his own order, over whom he obtains
a compleat victory.</HEAD>
<P>SUCH a preheminence could not be enjoyed
without exciting the malevolence of envy
and detraction, in the propagation of which,
none were so industrious as the brethren of
his own order, who, had like him, made a
descent upon this island, and could not without
repining, see the whole harvest in the hands of
one man, who with equal art and discretion
avoided all intercourse with their society. In
vain they strove to discover his pedigree, and
detect the particular circumstances of his life
and conversation; all their inquiries were basled
by the obscurity of his origin, and that solitary
scheme which he had adopted in the beginning
of his career. The whole fruit of their investi∣gation,
amounted to no more than a certainty
that there was no family of any consideration
in Europe, known by the denomination of Fa∣thom;
and this discovery they did not fail to di∣vulge
for the benefit of our adventurer, who
had by this time, taken such firm root in the
favour of the great, as to set all those little arts
at defiance; and when the report reached his
ear, actually made his friends merry with the
conjectures which had been circulated at his ex∣pence.</P>
<P>His adversaries finding themselves disappointed
in this effort, held a consultation to devise other
measures against him, and came to a resolution
<PB N="238" REF="247"/>
of ending him by the sword, or rather of ex∣pelling
him from the kingdom, by the fear of
death, which they hoped he had not courage
enough to resist, because his deportment had
been always remarkably mild and pacific. It was
upon this supposition, that they left to the deter∣mination
of the dice, the choice of the person
who should execute their plan; and the lot fall∣ing
upon a Swiss, who from the station of a foot∣soldier
in the Dutch service, out of which he
had been drummed for theft, had erected him∣self
into the rank of a self-created chevalier;
this hero fortified himself with a double dose of
brandy, and betook himself to a certain noted
coffee-house, with an intent to affront count
Fathom in publick.</P>
<P>He was lucky enough to find our adventurer
sitting at a table in conversation with some per∣sons
of the first rank; upon which he seated him∣self
in the next box, and after having intruded
himself into their discourse, which happened to
turn upon the politicks of some German court;
“Count,” said he to Ferdinand, in a very a∣brupt
and disagreeable manner of address, “I
was last night in company with some gentle∣men,
among whom a dispute happened about the
place of your nativity; pray, what country are
you of?” “Sir,” answered the other, with
great politeness, “I at present have the honour
to be of England.” “Oho!” replied the che∣valier,
“I ask your pardon, that is to say, you
are incog.—Some people may find it convenient
to keep themselves in that situation.” “True,”
said the count “but some people are too well
known to enjoy that privilege.” The Swiss
being a little disconcerted at this repartee, which
<PB N="239" REF="248"/>
extracted a smile from the audience; after some
pause, observed, that persons of a certain class,
had good reason to drop the remembrance of
what they have been; but a good citizen will
not forget his country or former condition.
“And a bad citizen,” faith Fathom, “cannot
if he would, provided he has met with his de∣serts;
a sharper may as well forget the shape of
a die, or a discarded soldier the sound of a
drum.”</P>
<P>As the chevalier's character and story were
not unknown, this application raised a universal
laugh at his expence, which provoked him to
such a degree, that starting up, he swore Fa∣thom
could not have mentioned any object in
nature that he himself resembled so much as a
drum, which was exactly typified by his empti∣ness
and sound, with this difference however, that
a drum was never noisy till beaten, whereas the
count would never be quiet until he should have
undergone the same discipline. So saying, he laid
his hand upon his sword with a menacing look, and
walked out as if in expectation of being followed
by our adventurer, who suffered himself to be de∣tained
by the company, and very calmly took
notice, that his antagonist would not be ill
pleased at their interposition. Perhaps he would
not have comported himself with such case and
deliberation, had not he made such remarks up∣on
the disposition of the chevalier, as convinced
him of his own safety. He had perceived a per∣plexity
and perturbation in the countenance of
the Swiss, when he first entered the coffee-room;
his blunt and precipitate way of accosting him,
seemed to denote confusion and compulsion; and
in the midst of his ferocity, this accurate ob∣server
<PB N="240" REF="249"/>
discerned the trepidation of fear. By the
help of these signs, his sagacity soon compre∣hended
the nature of his schemes, and prepared
accordingly for a formal defiance.</P>
<P>His conjecture was verified next morning by
a visit from the chevalier, who taking it for
granted that Fathom would not face an adver∣sary
in the field, because he had not followed
him from the coffee-house, went to his lodgings
with great confidence, and demanded to see the
count upon an affair that would admit of no
delay. Maurice, according to his instructions,
told him that his master was gone out, but de∣sired
he would have the goodness to repose him∣self
in a parlour, till the count's return, which
he expected every moment. Ferdinand, who had
taken post in a proper place for observation, see∣ing
his antagonist fairly admitted, took the same
road, and appearing before him, wrapped up in
a long Spanish cloak, desired to know what had
procured him the honour of such an early visit.
The Swiss raising his voice to conceal his agita∣tion
explained his errand, in demanding repara∣tion,
for the injury his honour had sustained the
preceding day, in that odious allusion to a scan∣dalous
report which had been raised by the ma∣lice
of his enemies; and insisted in a very impe∣rious
stile, upon his attending him forthwith to
the nursery in Hyde-park. “Have a little pa∣tience,
said our adventurer with great compo∣sure,
and I will do myself the pleasure to wait
upon you in a few moments.”</P>
<P>With these words, he rung the bell, and call∣ing
for a bason of water, laid aside his cloak,
and displayed himself in his shirt, with a sword
in his right-hand, which was all over besmeared
<PB N="241" REF="250"/>
with recent blood, as if he had just come from
the slaughter of a foe. This phaenomenon made
such an impression upon the astonished chevalier,
already discomposed by the resolute behaviour of
the count, that he became jaundiced with terror
and dismay, and while his teeth chattered in his
head, told our hero he had hoped from his known
politeness, to have found him ready to acknow∣ledge
an injury which might have been the effect
of anger or misapprehension, in which case the af∣fair
might have been compromised to their mutual
satisfaction, without proceeding to those extremi∣ties,
which, among men of honour, are always ac∣counted
the last resource. To this representation,
Ferdinand answered, that the affair had been of the
chevalier's own seeking, inasmuch as he had in∣truded
himself into his company, and treated him
with the most insolent and unprovoked abuse, which
plainly flowed from a premeditated design against
his honour and reputation; he therefore, far
from being disposed to own himself in the wrong,
would not even accept of a public acknowledg∣ment
from him the aggressor, whom he look∣ed
upon as an infamous sharper, and was re∣solved
to chastise accordingly.</P>
<P>Here the conversation was interrupted by the
arrival of a person who was brought to the door
in a chair, and conducted into another apart∣ment,
from which a message was brought to the
count, importing, that the stranger desired to
speak with him, upon business of the last im∣portance.
Fathom having chid the servant for
admitting people without his order, desired the
Swiss to excuse him for a minute longer, and went
into the next room; from whence the follow∣ing
dialogue was overheard by this challenger.
<PB N="422" REF="251"/>
“Count,” said the stranger, “you are not ig∣norant
of my pretensions to the heart of that
young lady, at whose house I met you yesterday;
therefore you cannot be surprized when I declare
myself displeased with your visits and behaviour
to my mistress, and demand that you will in∣stantly
promise to drop the correspondence.”
“Else what follows?” answered Ferdinand, with
a cool and temperate voice. “My resentment
and immediate defiance; replied the other, for
the only alternative I propose, is to forego your
design upon that lady, or to decide our preten∣sions
by the sword.”</P>
<P>Our hero having expressed a regard for this
visitant, as the son of a gentleman whom he
honoured, was at the pains to represent the un∣reasonableness
of his demand, and the folly of
his presumption; and earnestly exhorted him to
put the issue of his cause upon a more safe and
equitable footing. But this admonition, in∣stead
of appeasing the wrath, seemed to inflame
the resentment of the opponent, who swore he
would not leave him until he should have ac∣complished
the purport of his errand. In vain
our adventurer requested half an hour for the
dispatch of some urgent business, in which he
was engaged with a gentleman in the other par∣lour:
this impetuous rival rejected all the terms
he could propose, and even challenged him to
decide the controversy upon the spot; an expe∣dient
to which the other having assented with
reluctance, the door was secured, the swords
unsheathed, and an hot engagement ensued, to
the inexpressible pleasure of the Swiss, who did
not doubt that he himself would be screened from
all danger by the event of this rencontre: ne∣vertheless,
his hope was disappointed in the de∣feat
<PB N="243" REF="252"/>
of the stranger, who was quickly disarmed,
in consequence of a wound through the sword
arm; upon which occasion Fathom was heard to
say, that in consideration of his youth and fa∣mily,
he had spared his life; but he would not
act with the same tenderness towards any other
antagonist. He then bound up the limb he had
disabled, conducted the vanquished party to his
chair, rejoined the chevalier with a serene coun∣tenance,
and asking pardon for having detained
him so long, proposed they should instantly set out
in an hackney coach, for the place of appointment.</P>
<P>The stratagem thus conducted, had all the
success the inventor could desire. The fear of
the Swiss had risen almost to an extasy, before
the count quitted the room; but after this
sham battle which had been preconcerted be∣twixt
our adventurer and his friend Ratchkali,
the chevalier's terrors were unspeakable. He
considered Fathom as a devil incarnate, and went
into the coach as a malefactor bound for Tyburn.
He would have gladly compounded for the loss of
a leg or arm, and entertained some transient
gleams of hope, that he should escape for half
a dozen flesh-wounds, which he would have
willingly received, as the price of his presumption;
but, these hopes were banish'd by the remembrance
of that dreadful declaration which he had heard
the count make, after having overcome his last ad∣versary;
and he continued under the power of the
most insupportable pannic, until the carriage halted
at Hyde-park-corner, were he crawled forth in a
most piteous and lamentable condition; so that when
they reached the spot, he was scarce able to stand.</P>
<P>Here he made an effort to speak, and propos∣ed
an accommodation upon a new plan, by
<PB N="244" REF="253"/>
which he promised to leave his cause to the ar∣bitrement
of those gentlemen who were present
at the rupture, and to ask pardon of the count,
provided he should be found guilty of a trespass
upon good manners: but this proposal would
not satisfy the implacable Ferdinand, who per∣ceiving
the agony of the Swiss, resolved to make
the most of the adventure, and giving him to
understand he was not a man to be trisled with,
desired him to draw without further preamble.
Thus compelled, the unfortunate gamester pulled
off his coat, and putting himself in a posture,
to use the words of Nym, “winked and held
out his cold iron.”</P>
<P>Our adventurer, far from making a gentle
use of the advantages he possessed, fiercely at∣tacked
him, while he was incapable of making
resistance, and aiming at a fleshy part, ran
him through the arm and outside of the
shoulder at the very first pass: the chevalier,
already stupified with the horror of expectation,
no sooner felt his adversary's point in his body,
than he fell to the ground, and concluding he
was no longer a man for this world, began to
cross himself with great devotion, while Fa∣thom
walked home deliberately, and in his way
sent a couple of chairmen to the assistance of the
wounded knight.</P>
<P>This atchievement, which could not be con∣cealed
from the knowledge of the publick, not
only furnished the character of Fathom with
fresh wreaths of admiration and applause, but
likewise effectually secured him from any future
attempts of his enemies, to whom the Swiss, for
his own sake, had communicated such terrible
<PB N="245" REF="254"/>
ideas of his valour, as over-awed the whole com∣munity.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="34" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He performs another exploit that conveys a true
idea of his gratitude and honour.</HEAD>
<P>IT was not long after this celebrated victory,
that he was invited to spend part of the sum∣mer,
at the house of a country gentleman, who
lived about one hundred miles from London,
possessed of a very opulent fortune, the greatest
part of which was expended in acts of old
English hospitality. He had met with our hero
by accident, at the table of a certain great man,
and was so struck with his manner and conver∣sation,
as to desire his acquaintance and culti∣vate
his friendship; and he thought himself ex∣tremely
happy in having prevailed upon him to
pass a few weeks in his family.</P>
<P>Fathom, among his other observations, per∣ceived
that there was a domestic uneasiness, oc∣casioned
by a very beautiful young creature, about
the age of fifteen, who resided in the house un∣der
the title of the gentleman's niece, though she
was in reality, his natural daughter, born before
his marriage. This circumstance was not un∣known
to his lady, by whose express approba∣tion
he had bestowed particular attention upon
the education of the child, whom we shall di∣stinguish
by the name of Celinda: their libera∣lity
in this particular, had not been misapplied;
for she not only gave marks of uncommon
capacity, but as she grew up, became more and
more amiable in her person, and was now re∣turned
<PB N="246" REF="255"/>
from the boarding-school, possessed of
every accomplishment that could be acquired
by one of her age and opportunities. These
qualifications; which endeared her to every other
person, excited the jealousy and displeasure of
her supposed aunt, who could not bear to see
her own children eclipsed by this illegitimate
daughter, whom she therefore discountenanced
upon all occasions, and exposed to such mortifi∣cations
as would in all appearance drive her from
her father's house. This persecuting spirit was
very disagreeable to the husband, who loved Ce∣linda
with, a truly paternal affection, and pro∣duced
abundance of family disquiet; but being
a man of a peaceable and yielding disposition,
he could not long maintain the resolution he had
taken in her favour, and therefore he ceased op∣posing
the malevolence of his wife.</P>
<P>In this unfortunate predicament stood the
fair bastard, at the arrival of our adventurer,
who being allured by her charms, and apprized
of her situation at the same time, took the ge∣nerous
resolution to undermine her innocence,
that he might banquet his vicious appetite with
the spoils of her beauty. Perhaps such a brutal
design might not have entered his imagination,
if he had not observed in the disposition of this
hapless maiden, certain peculiarities from which
he derived the most confident presages of success.
Besides a total want of experience, that left her
open and unguarded against the attacks of the
other sex, she discovered a remarkable spirit of
credulity and superstitious fear, which had been
cherished by the conversation of her school-fel∣lows:
she was particularly fond of musick, in
which she had made some progress; but so deli∣cate
<PB N="247" REF="256"/>
was the texture of her nerves, that one
day, while Fathom entertained the company
with a favourite air, she actually swooned with
pleasure.</P>
<P>Such sensibility our projector well knew,
must be diffused through all the passions of her
heart; he congratulated himself upon the sure
ascendancy he had gained over her in this parti∣cular;
and forthwith began to execute the plan
he had erected for her destruction. That he
might the more effectually deceive the vigilance
of her father's wife, he threw such a dash of
affectation in his complaisance towards Celinda,
as could not escape the notice of that prying ma∣tron,
though it was not palpable enough to dis∣oblige
the young lady herself, who could not so
well distinguish between overstrained courtesy and
real good breeding: this behaviour screened him
from the suspicion of the family, who considered
it as an effort of politeness, to cover his indif∣ference
and disgust for the daughter of his friend,
who had by this time, given some reason to be∣lieve
she looked upon him with the eyes of af∣fection;
so that the opportunities he enjoyed of
conversing with her in private, were less liable
to intrusion or inquiry. Indeed, from what I
have already observed, touching the sentiments
of her step-dame, that lady, far from taking
measures for thwarting our hero's design, would
have rejoiced at the execution of it, and had
she been informed of his intent, might have
fallen upon some method to facilitate the enter∣prize;
but, as he solely depended upon his own
talents, he never dreamed of soliciting such an
auxiliary.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="257"/>
Under cover of instructing and accomplishing
her in the exercise of musick, he could not want
occasions for promoting his aim; when after
having soothed her sense of hearing, even to a
degree of ravishment, so as to extort from her
an exclamation, importing, that he was surely
something supernatural! he never failed to whis∣per
some insidious compliment or tale of love,
exquisitely suited to the emotions of her soul.
Thus was her heart insensibly subdued; though
more than half his work was still undone; for,
at all times, she disclosed such purity of senti∣ment,
such inviolable attachment to religion and
virtue, and seemed so averse to all sorts of in∣flammatory
discourse, that he durst not presume
upon the footing he had gained in her affection,
to explain the baseness of his desire; therefore
applied to another of her passions, that proved
the bane of her virtue: this was her timidity,
which at first being constitutional, was afterwards
increased by the circumstances of her education,
and now aggravated by the artful conversation of
Fathom, which he checquered with dismal stories
of omens, portents, prophecies and apparitions,
delivered upon such unquestionable testimony,
and with such marks of conviction, as capti∣vated
the belief of the devoted Celinda, and
filled her imagination with unceasing terrors.</P>
<P>In vain she strove to dispel those frightful
ideas, and avoid such topics of discourse for the
future: the more she endeavoured to banish them,
the more troublesome they became; and such
was her infatuation, that as her terrors increased,
her thirst after that sort of knowledge was aug∣mented.
Many sleepless nights did she pass a∣midst
those horrors of fancy, starting at every
<PB N="249" REF="258"/>
noise, and sweating with dreary apprehension,
yet ashamed to own her fears, or sollicit the
comfort of a bed-fellow, left she should incur the
ridicule and censure of her father's wife; and
what rendered this disposition the more irksome,
was the solitary situation of her chamber, that
stood at the end of a long gallery scarce within
hearing of any other inhabited part of the
house.</P>
<P>All these circumstances had been duly weighed
by our projector, who having prepared Celinda
for his purpose, stole at midnight from his apart∣ment,
which was in another story, and ap∣proaching
her door, there uttered a piteous
groan; then softly retired to his bed, in full
confidence of seeing next day the effect of this
operation: nor did his arrow miss the mark:
poor Celinda's countenance gave such indications
of melancholy and dismay, that he could not
omit asking the cause of her disquiet, and she, at
his earnest request, was prevailed upon to com∣municate
the dreadful salutation of the preced∣ing
night, which she considered as an omen of
death to some person in the family, in all proba∣bility
to herself, as the groan seemed to issue
from one corner of her own apartment. Our
adventurer argued against this supposition, as
contradictory to the common observation of
those supernatural warnings, which are not usu∣ally
imparted to the person who is doomed to
die, but to some faithful friend or trusty servant,
particularly interested in the event. He therefore
supposed that the groans foreboded the death of
my lady, who seemed to be in a drooping state
of health, and were by her genius conveyed to
the organs of Celinda, who was the chief suf∣ferer
<PB N="250" REF="259"/>
by her jealous and barbarous disposition;
he likewise expressed an earnest desire to be an
ear-witness of such solemn communication, and
alledging that it was highly improper for a young
lady of her delicate feelings, to expose herself
alone to such another dismal visitation, begged
he might be allowed to watch all night in her
chamber, in order to defend her from the shock∣ing
impressions of fear.</P>
<P>Though no person ever stood more in need of
a companion or guard, and her heart throbbed
with transports of dismay at the prospect of night,
she rejected his proposal with due acknowledg∣ment,
and resolved to trust solely to the protec∣tion
of Heaven: not that she thought her inno∣cence
or reputation could suffer by her compliance
with his request; for hitherto, her heart was a
stranger to those young desires which haunt the
fancy and warm the breast of youth; so that
being ignorant of her danger, she saw not the
necessity of avoiding temptation: but she refused
to admit a man into her bed-chamber, merely
because it was a step altogether opposite to the
forms and decorum of life. Nevertheless, far
from being discouraged by this repulse, he knew
her fears would multiply, and reduce that reluc∣tance,
which, in order to weaken, he had recourse
to another piece of machinery, that operated
powerfully in behalf of his design.</P>
<P>Some years ago, a twelve-stringed instrument
was contrived by a very ingenious musician, by
whom it was aptly intitled the harp of Aeolus,
because, being properly applied to a stream of
air, it produces a wild, irregular variety of har∣monious
sounds, that seem to be the effect of
inchantment, and wonderfully dispose the mind
<PB N="251" REF="260"/>
for the most romantic situations. Fathom, who
was really a virtuoso in musick, had brought one
of those new-fashioned guittarres into the coun∣try,
and as the effect of it was still unknown
in the family, he that night converted it to the
purposes of his amour, by fixing it in the case∣ment
of a window belonging to the gallery, ex∣posed
to the west-wind, which then blew in a
gentle breeze. The strings no sooner felt the im∣pression
of the balmy zephyr, than they began
to pour forth a stream of melody, more ravish∣ingly
delightful than the song of Philomel, the
warbling brook, and all the concert of the wood.
The soft and tender notes of peace and love
were swelled up with the most delicate and in∣sensible
transition, into a loud hymn of triumph
and exultation, joined by the deep-toned organ,
and a full choir of voices, which gradually de∣cayed
upon the ear, until it died away, in dis∣tant
sound, as if a flight of angels had raised the
song in their ascent to Heaven. Yet the chords
hardly ceased to vibrate after the expiration of
this overture, which ushered in a composition
in the same pathetic stile; and this again was
succeeded by a third, almost without pause or
intermission, as if the artist's hand had been in∣defatigable,
and the theme never to be ex∣hausted.</P>
<P>His heart must be quite callous, and his ear
lost to all distinction, who could hear such har∣mony
without emotion; how deeply then must
it have affected the delicate Celinda, whose sen∣sations,
naturally acute, were whetted to a most
painful keenness, by her apprehension; who
could have no previous idea of such entertain∣ment,
and was credulous enough to believe the
<PB N="252" REF="261"/>
most improbable tale of superstition! She was
overwhelmed with awful terror, and never
doubting that the sounds were more than mortal,
recommended herself to the care of providence
in a succession of pious ejaculations.</P>
<P>Our adventurer having allowed some time for
the effect of this contrivance, repaired to her
chamber-door, and in a whisper conveyed thro'
the key-hole, asked if she was awake, begged
pardon for such an unseasonable visit, and de∣sired
to know her opinion of the strange mu∣sick
which he then heard. In spite of her no∣tions
of decency, she was glad of his intrusion,
and being in no condition to observe punctilios,
slipped on a wrapper, opened the door, and with
a faultering voice, owned herself frightened al∣most
to distraction. He pretended to console
her with reflections, importing, that she was in
the hands of a benevolent being, who would
not impose upon his creatures any task which
they could not bear; he insisted upon her re∣turning
to bed, and assured her he would not
stir from her chamber till day. Thus comforted
she betook herself again to rest, while he sat
down in an elbow-chair at some distance from
the bed-side, and in a soft voice began the con∣versation
with her, on the subject of those visi∣tations
from above, which though undertaken on
pretence of dissipating her fear and anxiety, was
in reality calculated for the purpose of augment∣ing
both.</P>
<P>“That sweet air,” said he, “seems design∣ed
for soothing the bodily anguish of some saint
in his last moments. Hark! how it rises into a
more sprightly and elevated strain, as if it were
an inspiriting invitation to the realms of bliss!
<PB N="253" REF="262"/>
sure he is now absolved from all the misery of
this life; that full and glorious concert of voices
and celestial harps, betoken his reception among
the heavenly choir, who now wast his soul to
paradisian joys! this is altogether great, solemn
and amazing! the clock strikes one, the sympho∣ny
hath ceased!”</P>
<P>This was actually the case; for, he had or∣dered
Maurice to remove the instrument at that
hour, lest the sound of it should become too fa∣miliar,
and excite the curiosity of some undaunt∣ed
domestic, who might frustrate his scheme, by
discovering the apparatus. As for poor Celinda,
her fancy was, by his musick and discourse, work∣ed
up to the highest pitch of enthusiastic terrors;
the whole bed shook with her trepidation, the
awful silence that succeeded the supernatural
musick, threw an additional damp upon her
spirits, and the artful Fathom affecting to snore
at the same time, she could no longer c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tain
her horror, but called upon his name with a
fearful accent, and having owned her present
situation insupportable, intreated him to draw
near her bed-side, that he might be within touch,
on any emergency.</P>
<P>This was a welcome request to our adven∣turer,
who asked pardon for his drowsiness, and
taking his station on the side of her bed, exhort∣ed
her to compose herself; then locking her
hand fast in his own, was again seized with
such an inclination to sleep, that he gradually
sunk down by her side, and seemed to enjoy his
repose in that attitude. Mean while, his tender∣hearted
mistress, that he might not suffer in his
health, by his humanity and complaisance, co∣vered
him with the counterpane as he slept, and
<PB N="254" REF="263"/>
suffered him to take his rest, without interrup∣tion:
till he thought proper to start up suddenly,
with an exclamation of, “Heaven watch over
us!” and then asked with symptoms of astonish∣ment,
if she had heard nothing. Such an a∣brupt
address, upon such an occasion, did not
fail to amaze and affright the gentle Celinda,
who unable to speak sprung towards her treache∣rous
protector; and he catching her in his arms,
bad her sear nothing; for he would, at the ex∣pence
of his life, defend her from all danger.</P>
<P>Having thus, by tampering with her weakness,
conquered the first and chief obstacles to his
design, he with great art and perseverance im∣proved
the intercourse to such a degree of inti∣macy
as could not but be productive of all the
consequences which he had foreseen. The
groans and musick were occasionally repeated,
so as to alarm the whole family, and inspire a
thousand various conjectures: he failed not to
continue his nocturnal visits and ghastly discourse,
until his attendance became so necessary to this
unhappy maiden, that she durst not stay in her
own chamber without his company, nor even
sleep, except in contact with her betrayer.</P>
<P>Such a commerce between two such persons
of a different sex, could not possibly be long
carried on, without degenerating from the pla∣tonic
system of sentimental love. In her paro∣xysms
of dismay, he did not forget to breathe
the soft inspirations of his passion, to which she
listened with more pleasure, as they diverted
the gloomy ideas of her fear; and by this time
his extraordinary accomplishments had made a
conquest of her heart. What therefore could
be a more interesting transition, than that from
<PB N="255" REF="264"/>
the most uneasy to the most agreeable sensation
of the human breast.</P>
<P>This being the case, the reader will not won∣der
that a consummate traitor, like Fathom,
should triumph over the virtue of an artless in∣nocent
young creature, whose passions he had
entirely under his command. The gradations
towards vice are almost imperceptible, and an
experienced seducer can strew them with such in∣ticing
and agreeable flowers, as will lead the young
sinner on insensibly, even to the most profligate
stages of guilt. All therefore that can be done
by virtue, unassisted with experience, is to avoid
every trial with such a formidable foe, by de∣clining
and discouraging the first advances to∣wards
a particular correspondence with perfidious
man, howsoever agreeable it may seem to be:
for, here, is no security but in conscious weak∣ness.</P>
<P>Fathom, though possessed of the spoils of poor
Celinda's honour, did not enjoy his success with
tranquillity. Reflection and remorse often in∣vaded
her in the midst of their guilty pleasures,
and embittered all those moments they had dedi∣cated
to mutual bliss. For the seeds of virtue
are seldom destroyed at once: even amidst the
rank productions of vice, they regerminate to a
sort of imperfect vegetation, like some scattered
hyacinths shooting up among the weeds of a
ruined garden, that testify the former culture and
amenity of the soil: she sighed at the sad remem∣brance
of that virgin dignity which she had lost;
she wept at the prospect of that disgrace, morti∣fication
and misery she should undergo, when
abandoned by this transient lover, and severely
<PB N="256" REF="265"/>
reproached him for the arts he had used to
shipwreck her innocence and peace.</P>
<P>Such expostulations are extremely unseasonable
when addressed to a man well nigh sated with
the effects of his conquest; they act like strong
blasts of wind applied to embers almost extin∣guished,
which instead of reviving the flame,
scatter and destroy every remaining particle of fire,
Our adventurer, in the midst of his peculiarities,
had inconstancy in common with the rest of his
sex. More than half cloyed with the possession
of Celinda, he could not fail to be disgusted with
her upbraidings; and had she not been the daugh∣ter
of a gentleman whose friendship he did not
think it his interest to forfeit, he would have
dropt this correspondence without reluctance or
hesitation: but, as he had measures to keep with
a family of such consequence, he constrained
his inclinations so far, as to counterfeit those
raptures he no longer felt, and found means to
appease those intervening tumults of her grief.</P>
<P>Foreseeing, however, that it would not be al∣ways
in his power to console her on these terms;
he resolved, if possible, to divide her affection,
which now glowed upon him too intensely; and
with that view, whenever she complained of
the vapours or dejection, he prescribed, and even
insisted upon her swallowing certain cordials of
the most palatable composition, without which
he never travelled; and these produced such
agreeable reveries and flow of spirits, that she
gradually became enamoured of intoxication;
while he encouraged the pernicious passion, by
expressing the most extravagant applause and ad∣miration
at the wild, irregular sallies it produced.
Without having first made this diversion, he
<PB N="257" REF="266"/>
would have found it impracticable to leave the
house in tranquillity; but when this bewitching
philtre grew into an habit, her attachment to
Ferdinand was insensibly dissolved; she began to
bear his neglect with indifference, and sequestring
herself from the rest of the family, used to sol∣licit
this new ally, for consolation.</P>
<P>Having thus put the finishing stroke to the
daughter's ruin, he took leave of the father with
many acknowledgments and expressions of grati∣tude
for his hospitality and friendship, and riding
cross the country to Bristol, took up his habi∣tation
near the Hot-well, where he staid during
the remaining part of the season. As for the mi∣serable
Celinda, she became more and more ad∣dicted
to the vices in which she had been initiated
by his superlative perfidy and craft; until she
was quite abandoned by decency and caution:
her father's heart was torn with anguish, while
his wife rejoiced in her fall: at length, her
ideas were quite debased by her infirmity; she
grew every day more and more sensual and de∣generate,
and contracted an intimacy with one
of the footmen, who was kind enough to take
her to wife, in hope of obtaining a good set∣tlement
from his master; but being disappointed
in his aim, he conducted her to London, where
he made shift to insinuate himself into another
service, leaving to her, the use, and partly the
advantage of her own person, which was still
uncommonly attractive.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">He repairs to Bristol spring, where he reigns Pa∣ramount
during the whole season.</HEAD>
<P>WE shall therefore, leave her in this com∣fortable
situation, and return to our ad∣venturer,
whose appearance at Bristol was con∣sidered
as a happy omen by the proprietor of the
hot-well, and all the people who live by the re∣sort
of company to that celebrated spring. Nor
were they deceived in their prognostic; Fathom,
as usual, formed the nucleus or kernel of the
beau monde; and the season soon became so
crouded, that many people of fashion were ob∣liged
to quit the place for want of lodging. Fer∣dinand
was the soul that animated the whole
society. He not only invented parties of plea∣sure,
but also, by his personal talents, rendered
them more agreeable: In a word, he regulated
their diversions, and the master of the ceremo∣nies
never would allow the ball to be begun,
until the count was seated.</P>
<P>Having thus made himself the object of ad∣miration
and esteem, his advice was an oracle
to which they had recourse in all doubtful cases
of punctilio or dispute, or even of medicine;
for among his other accomplishments, his dis∣course
on that subject was so plausible, and well
adapted to the understanding of his hearers, that
any person who had not actually studied the me∣dical
art, would have believed he was inspired
by the spirit of Aesculapius. What contributed
to the agrandizement of his character in this
branch of knowledge, was a victory he obtained
<PB N="259" REF="268"/>
over an old physician, who plied at the well,
and had one day unfortunately begun to harrangue
in the pump-room, upon the nature of the Bris∣tol-water;
in the course of this lecture, he un∣dertook
to account for the warmth of the fluid;
and his ideas being perplexed with a great deal
of reading, which he had not been able to di∣gest,
his disquisition was so indistinct, and his
expression so obscure and unentertaining, that
our hero seized the opportunity of displaying his
own erudition, by venturing to contradict some
circumstances of the doctor's hypothesis, and
substituting a theory of his own, which, as he
had invented it for the purpose, was equally a∣musing
and chimerical.</P>
<P>He alledged, that fire was the sole vivisying
principle that pervaded all nature; that as the
heat of the sun concocted the juice of vegetables
and ripened those fruits that grow upon the sur∣face
of this globe, there was likewise an im∣mense
store of central fire reserved within the
bowels of the earth, not only for the genera∣tion
of gems, fossils, and all the purposes of
the mineral world; but likewise, for cherishing
and keeping alive those plants which would
otherwise perish by the winter's cold. The ex∣istence
of such a fire, he proved from the na∣ture
of all those volcanos, which in almost every
corner of the earth, are continually vomiting
up either flames or smoke. “These,” said he,
“are the great vents appointed by nature, for
the discharge of that rarified air, and combusti∣ble
matter, which if confined, would burst the
globe asunder; but besides the larger outlets,
there are some small chimnies through which
part of the heat transpires; a vapour of that
<PB N="260" REF="269"/>
sort, I conceive, must pass through the bed
or channel of this spring, the waters of which,
accordingly, retain a moderate warmth.”</P>
<P>This account, which totally overthrew the
other's doctrine, was so extremely agreeable to
the audience, that the testy doctor lost his tem∣per,
and gave them to understand without pre∣amble,
that he must be a person wholly ignorant
of natural philosophy, who could invent such a
ridiculous system, and they involved in worse
than an Aegyptian fog, that could not at once
discern its weakness and absurdity. This de∣claration
introduced a dispute, which was unani∣mously
determined in favour of our adventurer.
On all such occasions, the stream of prejudice
runs against the physician, even though his anta∣gonist
has nothing to recommend himself to the
favour of the spectators: and this decision de∣pends
upon divers considerations; in the first
place, there is a continual war carried on against
the learned professions, by all those who, con∣scious
of their own ignorance, seek to level the
reputation of their superiors, with their own.
Secondly, in all disputes upon physic, that hap∣pen
betwixt a person who really understands the
art, and an illiterate pretender, the arguments of
the first will seem obscure and unintelligible to
those who are unacquainted with the previous
systems on which they are built; while the
other's theory, derived from common notions,
and superficial observation, will be more agree∣able,
because better adapted to the comprehen∣sion
of the hearers. Thirdly, the judgment of
the multitude is apt to be biassed by that surprize,
which is the effect of seeing an artist foiled at
his own weapons, by one who engages him only
for amusement.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="270"/>
Fathom, besides these advantages, was blessed
with a flow of language, an elegant address, a
polite and self-denying stile of argumentation,
together with a temper not to be ruffled; so
that the victory could not long waver between
him and the physician, to whom he was infinitely
superior in every acquisition but that of solid
learning, of which the judges had no idea. This
contest was not only glorious but profitable to
our adventurer, who grew into such request in
his medical capacity, that the poor doctor was ut∣terly
deserted by his patients, and Fathom's ad∣vice
sollicited by every valetudinarian in the
place; nor did he forfeit the character he thus
acquired, by any miscarriages in his practice; be∣ing
but little conversant with the Materia me∣dica,
the circle of his prescriptions was very
small: his chief study was to avoid all drugs of
rough operation, and uncertain effect; and to ad∣minister
such only as should be agreeable to the
palate, without doing violence to the constitution.
Such a physician could not but be agreeable
to people of all dispositions; and as most of the
patients were in some shape hypochondriac, the
power of imagination co-operating with his re∣medies,
often effected a cure.</P>
<P>On the whole, it became the fashion to con∣sult
the count in all distempers, and his reputa∣tion
would have had its run, though the death
of every patient had given the lie to his preten∣sions.
But empty same was not the sole fruit
of his success. Though no person would pre∣sume
to affront this noble graduate with a fee;
they did not fail to manifest their gratitude by
some more valuable present: every day some
superb piece of china, curious snuff-box or
<PB N="262" REF="271"/>
jewel was pressed upon him; so that at the end
of the season, he could almost have furnished a
toy-shop, with the acknowledgments he had re∣ceived:
not only his avarice but his pleasure
was gratified in the course of his medical admi∣nistration.
He enjoyed free access, egress and
regress, with all the females at the well, and no
matron scrupled to put her daughter under his
care and direction. These opportunities could not
be lost upon a man of his intriguing genius;
though he conducted his amours with such dis∣cretion,
that during the whole season, no lady's
character suffered on his account: yet he was
highly fortunate in his addresses; and we may
venture to affirm, that the reproach of barren∣ness
was more than once removed by the vigour
of his endeavours.</P>
