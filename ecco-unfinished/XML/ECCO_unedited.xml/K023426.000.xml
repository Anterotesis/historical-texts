<HEAD>FREE REFLECTIONS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN <HI>"A Letter to George Steevens, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> by James Boaden, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>"</HI> just published, is the following acknowledgement; which so exactly describes my own feelings in the same situation, that I take the liberty to adopt the very words.</P>
<P>"When a report first went abroad, that Mr. Ireland, of Norfolk-street, had made a discovery so important as the papers of Shakspeare, the writer of these sheets went to see them, and was very politely allowed by their possessor to hear him read them at leisure. In some instances cre∣dulity is no disgrace:—strong enthusiasm is always eager to believe. I confess, therefore, that, for some time after I had seen them, I continued to believe them genuine. They bore the character of the poet's writing—the paper appeared of suf∣ficient age—the water-marks were earnestly dis∣played, and the matter diligently applauded.—
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>To a mind filled with the most ardent love and the most eager zeal, disarmed of caution by the character too of the gentleman who displayed them, it will not be a subject of severe reproof, that the wished impression was made.</P>
<P>I remember that I beheld the papers with the tremor of the purest delight—touched the inva∣luable relics with reverential respect, and deemed even existence dearer, as it gave me so refined a satisfaction. He, who has long combatted with the arts of literary imposture, may smile at the simplicity of this avowal, although he should be unable to refuse his praise to the candour by which it has been dictated."</P>
<P>Such were precisely <HI>my</HI> feelings when Mr. Ireland did me the favour to shew me the papers, &amp;c. adverted to; and I sincerely hope, that nothing I may have occasion to say concerning them, will be construed into disrespect for him: their authen∣ticity is now on trial at the bar of the publick, and every one is free to give evidence; as mine will be saithfully delivered, I trust it will be favourably received.</P>
<P>Unskilled as I am, the only doubt that struck me, on hearing the papers read, was of the word <HI>whymsycalle;</HI> which, I then observed, I did not
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>remember to have met with at so early a period: this objection was soon overruled by the suppo∣sition that, as the word must have been produced at some period, Shakspeare might then have coined it. I acquiesced, departed highly gratified, and in all other respects entirely satisfied.</P>
<P>In a conversation some time after, on the sub∣ject of these papers, with a gentleman of the soundest judgment, and best information, I hinted the doubt. I had entertained of the word <HI>whymsy∣calle;</HI> he pronounced it too modern for Shaks∣peare: which, recollecting the adage <HI>ex pede Her∣culem,</HI> caused me to look a little farther into the matter.</P>
<P>Most of the observations I made, many of which, Mr. Boaden having anticipated me in them, are omitted, I am proud to say, have been approved of by the gentleman alluded to. I sub∣mit the following, therefore, with a respectful confidence, to the skilful in Shakspearean lore; stimulated by an irresistible impulse to contribute my faint breath towards the dispelling these newly∣arisen vapours: which, if suffered to condense, might dim the effulgence of Shakspeare!</P>
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>
<P>In page 1, following the preface to, <HI>"Miscel∣laneous Papers,"</HI> &amp;c. is said, "for <HI>I,</HI> read <HI>Aye: this was the Author's usual mode of writing.</HI>"— Mr. Ireland might have added, <HI>and of every other Author at that period.</HI></P>
<P>The superscription of queen Elizabeth's letter to Shakspeare, written with her own hand, is as carefully worded, as if it were to have been sent by the penny-post; had the office so named been then established. So far from directing a letter, Elizabeth wrote not the inward contents; that haughty personage was not in the habit of such condescension: her signature only, or, on rare occasions, an additional line, comprised nearly the whole of her hand-writing, in any letter from her. In the letter the queen styles him "<HI>Mas∣terre</HI> William;" the orthography of that age was <HI>Maister,</HI> from the old French <HI>Maistre,</HI> now written <HI>Maitre;</HI> the French having ejected the <HI>s</HI> from many words in which we, though they are derived from them, retain it. This Chattertonism occurs frequently in these wonderful, or rather blunder∣ful, papers.</P>
<P>"50 <HI>Poundes</HI>" was a great sum, at that period, to receive for playing <HI>"before the Lorde Leyces∣terre;"</HI> although the <HI>"Expenneces thereuponne"</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>amounted to "19 <HI>poundes:</HI>" and, per contra, "2 <HI>shyllynges moure</HI>" to <HI>"Masterre Lowinne;"</HI> whom, in the <HI>"Deed of Trust to John Hemynge,"</HI> Shakspeare terms <HI>"oure best Actorr;"</HI> was but a small compliment
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I remark here, en passant, that <HI>compliment,</HI> in Shakspeare's time, was used as a noun only; in queen Elizabeth's letter to him it appears as a verb.</NOTE> <HI>"forre bys Goode Servyces and welle playinge."</HI> Even the spelling of this cele∣brated actor's name is dubious: in the list of performers affixed to <HI>Sejanus, The Foxe, The Alchemist,</HI> and <HI>Catiline,</HI> (Ben Jonson's Works, folio, 1616) his name is uniformly spelt <HI>Lowin:</HI> and, surely, the person who entered into a legal contract with him, as Shakspeare is, in these papers, represented to have done, must have known the customary orthography of his name.</P>
<P>It may also be observed, that the well-known urbanity of Shakspeare's mind, and suavity of his manners, could not have permitted him to affront the great Burbage, and other first-rate performers, by unnecessarily styling Lowin, however excel∣lent, in a legal instrument of public notoriety, "oure <HI>best</HI> Actorr."</P>
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
<P>"Letter to <HI>Anna Hatherrewaye.</HI>"</P>
<P>This female's names were <HI>Anne Hathaway. Anna</HI> is a Latin adoption of, comparatively, mo∣dern use; the orthography of <HI>Hatherrewaye</HI> is merely Chattertonian.</P>
<P>In the letter to her, a kingly crown is termed a "gyldedde <HI>bawble.</HI>" <HI>Bawble</HI> formerly meant the carved truncheon, with a fool's head at the top of it, used by court and stage buffoons; there∣fore a very unlikely epithet to be applied by Shakspeare to the symbol of majesty; to which he every where pays great respect.</P>
<P>In the <HI>"Letter to the Earl of Southampton,"</HI> we read <HI>"itte is a Budde which Bllossommes Blloomes"</HI> &amp;c. Shakspeare was too good a naturalist not to know, that a <HI>Bud</HI> first <HI>Blooms,</HI> then <HI>Blossoms.</HI></P>
<P>"tooe <HI>sublyme</HI> a feeling," in the same letter, is a very questionable expression.</P>
<P>The scrawl of this sublime and blooming letter is what school-boys call pot-hooks and hangers; and utterly unlike the hand-writing of that or any other age: and, if the signature be the autograph of <HI>any</HI> earl of Southampton, it is, I am informed, not that of Shakspeare's benefactor.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>
<P>In the <HI>"Profession of Faith," "acceeded toe"</HI> is a phrase an hundred years too modern for Shak∣speare.</P>
<P>Towards the conclusion of the <HI>"Profession"</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Chickenne</HI> is used for the <HI>Hen,</HI> who receives her brood under her wings; on the propriety of which consult the holy scriptures. <HI>Chickenne</HI> is also ob∣jectionable in this place as ungrammatical, it being used in the singular number; whereas, the old singular was <HI>Chick,</HI> and <HI>Chicken</HI> the plural. So <HI>Ox,</HI> and <HI>Oxen; Cow,</HI> and <HI>Cowen;</HI> contracted into <HI>Kine.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>"Letter to Richard Cowley"</HI> we read, "a <HI>whymsycalle</HI> conceyt;"—the word <HI>whymsycalle,</HI> or <HI>whimsical,</HI> as I have already said, does not, I am assured, occur in or near that period. I have a little book, printed in 1631, entituled "<HI>Whim∣zies:</HI> or a New Cast of Characters;"
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following extract from the character of <HI>"A Ruffian,"</HI> in this scarce book, as it relates to our ancient theatres, may not be unpleasing.</P>
<P>"To a play they wil hazard to go, though with never a rag of money: where after the <HI>second Act,</HI> when the <HI>Doore</HI> is weakly guarded, they will make <HI>forcible entrie;</HI> a knock with a Cudgell is the worst; whereat though they grumble, they rest pacified upon their admittance. Forthwith, by violent assault and assent, they aspire to the two-pennie roome; where being furnished with Tinder, Match, and a portion of decayed <HI>Barmoodas,</HI> they smoake it most terribly, applaud a prophane jeast unmeasurably, and in the end grow distastefully rude to all the Companie. At the Conclusion of all, they single out their <HI>dainty Doxes,</HI> to cloze up a fruitlesse day with a sinneful evening."</P></NOTE> which,
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>though <HI>Whim</HI> must apparently have preceded, is the earliest instance I can recollect of any word like <HI>whymsycalle.</HI></P>
<P>One might imagine, from the careful super∣scription of the letter to Cowley, that queen Eli∣zabeth had condescended to direct that too.</P>
<P>The figure <HI>"evidently meant for Shylock"</HI> is represented with a blue cap on. Jews in Venice are obliged to wear a red cap or hat, as a badge of their persuasion. Shakspeare, however, or the painter of this grotesque figure, might not be acquainted with the costume of that place and people.</P>
<P>In the <HI>"Deed of Gift to Ireland,"</HI> after the word <HI>"followithe"</HI> are three conjunctive notes of admiration!!! I believe two notes of admiration in conjunction have not been used till very lately. When the plays of <HI>"Kyng henrye thyrde of Eng∣lande,"</HI> "<HI>Kyage Hy</HI> vii," &amp;c. come to light, we
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>must not be surprised at finding in them the words <HI>swindler, shawl,</HI> and <HI>Otabeite;</HI> or the **** of <HI>Tristram Shandy.</HI></P>
<P>As Shakspeare's <HI>Tempest</HI> and <HI>Macbeth,</HI> which were given to Cowley, were never printed till the folio, 1623, was put forth by Heminge and Condell; how chanced it that Heminge did not, having possession of the <HI>"Oakenn Cheste,"</HI> with all the Plays therein, and being, we may imagine, on good terms with the party, prevail on "Masterr Burbage," as he had done with Cowley, to per∣mit him to publish <HI>"y<SUP>e</SUP> Virginn Quene"</HI> in said folio?</P>
<P>For what reason did Heminge exclude from the folio Shakspeare's <HI>"newe Playe neverr yette imprynted called Kynge Hy VII,"</HI> which was <HI>"toe bee whollye for s<SUP>d</SUP> J. Hemynge?"</HI> And why did not Heminge publish in that folio the <HI>"Playe called Kynge Vorrtygerne,"</HI> and appropriate what the copy-right of it might then be deemed worth, to the use and advantage of <HI>"thatt Ghylde"</HI> to whom it was assigned?</P>
<P>The play of <HI>"Kynge henrye thyrde of Englande"</HI> having, with <HI>"Henry fowrthe," "Henrye fyfthe," "Kyng John,"</HI> and <HI>"Kyng Leare,"</HI> been given by Shakspeare to "<HI>Masterre William Henrye Ire∣lande;</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>we may hope that Masterre Samuel Ireland, or Masterre Samuel-William-Henry Ireland, to whom we are obliged for the immaculate <HI>"Kynge Leare,"</HI> will speedily favour the publick with it: a play which Shakspeare's "good and Worthye Freynd John Hemynge," to whose "honorr" he trusted, withheld, not only from a poor child, but from even himself, being already produced; the other hitherto - unheard - of play, coming within the family-compact, <HI>"same name and arms,"</HI> &amp;c. is surely a less difficult attainment: and I con∣clude that the <HI>"more interesting historical Play,"</HI> announced in Mr. Ireland's preface, is the play of <HI>"Kyng henrye thyrde of Englande."</HI></P>
<P>Should any fortunate circumstance restore to us <HI>"Kynge H<SUP>y</SUP> vii,"</HI> and who knows what industry and ingenuity may effect? we shall probably pos∣sess all the Dramas of Shakspeare, hitherto men∣tioned; as the writer of these Reflections, or what∣ever they may be termed, is particularly acquainted with, and has great influence over, a now-living <HI>"Masterr Burbage,"</HI> lineally descended, we must suppose, from Shakspeare's <HI>Burbage;</HI> through whose, or some other means, he doubts not he shall be enabled to recover an entire copy of <HI>"y<SUP>e</SUP> Virginn Quene:"</HI> from which he has already obtained a few extracts, subjoined to these remarks.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="13"/>
<P>They are, for the reader's ease, though not perhaps the antiquary's gratification, divested of the rust of age; the redundant spelling: but, let not a seeming lack of years be any impediment to a reverend estimation.</P>
<P>The <HI>"Tragedye of Kynge Leare,"</HI> our Pseudo-Shakspeare says, <HI>"Isse fromme Masterre Hol∣linneshedde."</HI></P>
<P>I have not a volume of that historian at present in my possession; but, to the best of my recollec∣tion, the orthography of his name in the title-page to his works is much more simple.</P>
<P>The "Libbertye" he has taken, Shakspeare adds, in having "somme lyttle deparretedde fromme hymme," "wille notte," he trusts "be blamedde bye" his <HI>"gentle Readerres."</HI></P>
<P>This is the first instance of Shakspeare's ap∣pealing to <HI>Readers;</HI> in writing his Dramas it is well known that he thought only of <HI>Audi∣tors</HI> and <HI>Spectators:</HI> — but, as it necessarily in∣cludes an implication that he had prepared this copy of <HI>"Kynge Leare"</HI> for the press himself, we might naturally expect the text to be correct; at least intelligible; so far from which, it is, mau∣gre Mr. Ireland's preface, the most incorrect,
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>unintelligible text I ever saw, in any copy of any play whatever: and, instead of supposing, as some may, Mr. Ireland, his son, or any other intelligent person, the fabricator; I should rather imagine it to be really, and bona fide, an ancient copy; taken surreptitiously and erroneously, from the mouths of the actors, by some Printer's illiterate devil: to which had, for private purposes, been added an imitation of Shakspeare's signature, and ad∣dress to his <HI>"gentle Readerres."</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Ireland says "that in the paper on which this play <HI>["Kynge Leare"]</HI> is written, more than twenty different water-marks appear."</P>
<P>If this be meant as evidence of the MS. of <HI>"Kynge Leare"</HI> being the genuine production, and hand-writing of Shakspeare; I doubt it will prove a weight in the opposite scale: when the opulent Shakspeare, as he undoubtedly was when his <HI>King Lear</HI> was produced, sat down to write a play, surely he was furnished with a quire or two of paper for the purpose; the sheets of which would, of course, all bear the same water-mark: whereas, admitting the copy in question to be an ancient, but stolen, one; a needy hireling, who could not afford better, may be supposed to have written on casually - collected and va∣riously - marked paper: and a modern fabri∣cator,
<PB N="17" REF="15"/>for argument' sake here imagined, would be compelled to collect old paper piece-meal; in all probability, containing "more than twenty different water-marks."</P>
<P>In <HI>"Kynge Leare"</HI> p. 4. we read, "Ande the whoresonne must be acknowleggede."</P>
<P>Shakespeare, if we may credit <HI>"The Deed of Trust to John Heyminge,"</HI> could, like his own Portia, better teach twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the twenty to follow his own teaching; otherwise he might have recollected this passage in regard to <HI>"thatte Chylde of whom wee have spokenn butt who must not be named here;"</HI> and who, if such <HI>"Chylde"</HI> ever existed, seems to have been one whose services stood bound to <HI>Goddesse Nature.</HI></P>
<P>The affectedly-antique spelling in <HI>"Kynge Leare"</HI> is, throughout, so unprecedentedly re∣dundant, as, of itself, to be a convincing proof of inartificial imitation; but the spelling of the Latin verb in the quotation, p. 4. <HI>"Glosterre Exilte,"</HI> with the old English termination, the double <HI>t,</HI> and <HI>e</HI> final, is so very ridiculous, that, could it be proved to have been by Shakspeare, we might hereafter say, that he had small English and less Latin; as we have been taught by Ben Jonson to say, that he had small Latin and less
<PB N="18" REF="16"/>Greek: but, if he had any Latin, he must have spelt the word <HI>Exit,</HI> not <HI>Exitte.</HI> To have done, therefore, with <HI>"Kynge Leare,"</HI> at least for the present, the blunders, corruptions, omissions, in∣terpolations, and sophistications, warrant me in say∣ing, that it is <HI>impossible</HI> for this MS. of <HI>"Kynge Leare"</HI> to have been the production and hand∣writing of Shakspeare.</P>
<P>I fear I am not justifiable in commenting upon a supposed letter from Shakspeare at Stratford, to a Printer or Bookseller in London, read to me by Mr. Ireland, and not yet made publick, relating to the play of <HI>"Vortygerne;"</HI> which informs us, that the price required for this perhaps-invaluable Drama was demurred at by the sordid trader, al∣tho' the Poet professes to think it one of his best productions: but I hope I shall be pardoned, even by the possessor of the letter, for observing that <HI>"The Deed of Trust to John Hemynge",</HI> in which <HI>"Vorrtygerne"</HI> is given to the unnamed <HI>"Chylde",</HI> is dated 1611; and, that the corres∣pondence between the Author and Trader is, I believe, stated or imagined to have occurred af∣ter Shakspeare's retirement from the stage, to pass the calm evening of his days at Stratford.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="17"/>
<P>Strange!—that the good, the grateful, the ge∣nerous Shakspeare, should give a <HI>"Playe neverr yette Impryntedde,"</HI> to a certain <HI>"Chylde &amp; bys heires for everre;"</HI> that he should then set this very play to sale for publication, at a period when the value of plays depended on their not being printed; and lastly, that, although the writings of this unequalled genius were in his life-time preferred before all others, and this was esteemed by him his best Play, his demand for it should not have been "acceeded toe:" but, the immortal Shakspeare be reduced to the humiliation of re∣questing that his favourite Play, and the corres∣pondence concerning it, should be transmitted to him at Stratford upon Avon!</P>
<P><HI>"The Deed of Trust to John Hemynge"</HI> and this degrading correspondence, surely, contradict each other!—admitting the latter to be the fact, what was Shakspeare to do with his admired Play at Stratford?—why not commission the person with whom he had entrusted it, to deliver it to his friend Heminge; that it might be acted in London, or at Bank-side, for the author or <HI>Chylde's</HI> emolu∣ment?—and not have his darling <HI>"Vorrtygerne"</HI> thrown among lumber, in an obscure country retirement, to perish through the ignorance of his survivors; or, be miraculously preserved, unseen, unheard-of, nearly two centuries: to enjoy, cum
<PB N="20" REF="18"/>multis aliis, a kind of resurrection, in which the disjointed fragments of our Poet's mental part are supernaturally gathered together, from <HI>"mye Play offe Kynge Leare"</HI> to a wager <HI>"o 5 Shyl∣lynges."</HI></P>
<P>Having thus thrown out a few hasty reflec∣tions, I conclude with a sincere wish; that, should <HI>Vortigern,</HI> or any other play imputed to Shake∣speare, possess merit enough to warrant the assumption; yet, by critical process be proved a forgery: the ingenious impostor may be ranked with Chatterton in fame; but find better fortune than did that ill-fated, and ever-to-be-lamented youth!</P>

<HEAD>EXTRACTS FROM THE VIRGIN QUEEN.</HEAD>
<P>IN the <HI>"Deed of Trust to John Hemynge,"</HI> published among the <HI>"Miscellaneous Papers,"</HI> by Mr. Ireland, is the following donation from Shakspeare.</P>
<P>"Toe Masterr Burbage I give as followithe from the Cheste afs<SUP>d</SUP>. mye two Playes of Cymbe∣lyne &amp; Othello together withe mye chosen Interlude neverr yette Impryntedd &amp; wrottenn for &amp; bye desyre of oure late gracyowse &amp; belovedd Quene Elizabethe called y<SUP>e</SUP> Virginn Quene &amp; playde 3 tymes before herreselfe att the Revells ye profytts from pryntyng same toe bee whollye for s<SUP>d</SUP>. Bur∣bage &amp; hys hrs shoulde hee thynke fyttenne soe toe doe."</P>
<PB N="22" REF="20"/>
<P>It has been supposed, by some who were inclin∣ed to think the <HI>"Miscellaneous Papers"</HI> genuine, that the Story of this chosen Interlude, as it is termed, of <HI>The Virginn Quene,</HI> related to the his∣tory of our Virgin Queen, Elizabeth, herself; but, a woman of her masculine mind could not have en∣dured to see herself pageanted in a Stage-play, or Interlude; and to have heard the fulsome adulation with which a drama, representing her own life and actions, must have been fraught: no; common sense assures us, that the story must have been foreign to herself, and founded either on ancient history, romance, or fable; or, that it was invent∣ed by the poet.</P>
<P>The MS. from which the subjoined extracts are taken puts the matter out of doubt; <HI>The Virgin Queen</HI> being an evident Sequel to <HI>The Tempest;</HI> and <HI>Claribel,</HI> a character therein, who was married to the <HI>King of Tunis,</HI> being, for rea∣sons which are developed in the Drama, The <HI>Vir∣gin</HI> Queen: that it was written by Shakspeare I will not take upon me to assert; yet, it is not likely that any other person should attempt a Sequel to what seemed so perfectly concluded as doth the Tem∣pest: but, I may safely say, that if it was not writ∣ten by Shakspeare, it is written in direct imitation of him.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="21"/>
<P>Neither will I assert that it is the identical In∣terlude or Play mentioned in the <HI>"Deed of Gift;"</HI> for, I frankly acknowledge I had not these extracts from Mr. Ireland: they have been in their pre∣sent owner's possession twenty years; and the contents of the <HI>"Miscellaneous Papers"</HI> may not have been in any body's possession twenty months.</P>
<P>The play of <HI>The Virgin Queen,</HI> being, as hath been mentioned, a sequel to <HI>The Tempest,</HI> resumes the story just where it broke off; and opens, on the morning subsequent to the meeting and recon∣ciliation of the Islanders and the Neapolitan Voyagers, with an Invocation by Ariel of the Sprites, Fairies, Elves, Goblins, &amp;c. in subjection to Prospero, to assemble and bid adieu at his em∣barkation to their master. This scene is chiefly lyrical.</P>
<P>After a Comick Scene between Trincalo, Ste∣phano, &amp;c. Prospero, Miranda, Ferdinand, and Caliban, enter.</P>
<P>Prospero, it seems, had intended to leave Ca∣liban in comfortable possession of his own cell and moveables, in the Island; but, that plan not ac∣cording with the latter's feelings, this dialogue ensues.</P>

<P>Upon Caliban's return, drest in an old robe, Gonzalo, who in the interim had entered, and conversed with Prospero, exclaims—</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GONZALO.</SPEAKER>
<L>I'th'name of all that's savage, what comes here?</L>
<L>The thing we spake of, surely, new-attir'd.</L>
<L>Why, how now, Sirrah? Wherefore this fine change</L>
<L>From a rough skin to an embroider'd silk?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CALIBAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>I crav'd this robe, that by yon scoffing apes</L>
<L>I might no more be flouted at, and mock'd;—</L>
<L>They call'd me servant-monster, mooncalf, fish!</L>
<L>Perchance they'll think I am more manlike now;</L>
<L>It may be, but I am not near so warm:</L>
<L>A shaggy hide, from the chill breeze to 'fend,</L>
<L>Is far more worth than silk, or glitt'ring gold.</L>
<P>The entire company being assembled, and in∣formation brought that all is ready for their em∣barking, Prospero says,
<Q><L>Here, then, I bid adieu to solitude!—</L>
<L>Farewell the desert wild, the sanded beach,</L>
<L>Where oft, from dawn to dusky e'en, I've strain'd</L>
<L>My care-dimm'd opticks to descry a sail;</L>
<L>Farewell my low-roof'd cave, whose flinty bed</L>
<L>My humbled body hardiness hath taught,</L>
<L>But never callous made my feeling mind;</L>
<L>While some, whose limbs enervate upon down,</L>
<L>Permit their hearts to harden into stone.</L>
<L>Farewell adversity;—O, best of schools!</L>
<PB N="28" REF="26"/>
<L>Still may I practice what in thee I learn'd.</L>
<L>Farewell my sorrows all!—hail, smiling peace!</L>
<L>And laud we Heav'n for this our blest release!</L></Q></P>
<P>After a caution given to Prospero by Ariel, for a very particular reason assigned, not to touch at any land till they had reach'd their place of desti∣nation, the whole company embark; Spirits of various denominations take leave of Prospero in a Lyrical Farewell: which concludes the first Act.</P>
<P>In some excellent papers on <HI>The Tempest,</HI> in <HI>The Adventurer,</HI> the writer of them, speaking of the brutal barbarity of the son of Sycorax, says— "I always lament that our author has not preserved this fierce and implacable spirit in Calyban, to the end of the play; instead of which, he has, I think, injudiciously put into his mouth, words that im∣ply repentance and understanding."
<Q><L>"—I'll be wise hereafter</L>
<L>"And seek for grace." &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>Whether the fine taste of the elegant writer did but coincide with Shakspeare's then-unknown am∣plification of this singular character; or whether, if it be an imitation only, the copier availed him∣self of Dr. Hawksworth's hint, is a question for the connoisseurs: certain it is, that the impla∣cable
<PB N="29" REF="27"/>spirit of this demi-devil bursts forth, the first opportunity it hath of again shewing itself.</P>
<P>On Caliban's being assured, in the first Act, that he shall accompany his master, and still-beloved mistress, he says, apart,
<Q><L>Now shall I see the wond'rous, yearn'd-for, place,</L>
<L>Where many Prospers and Mirandas dwell:</L>
<L>He calls it Milan:—I opine 'tis Heav'n!</L>
<L>It must, perforce; for many such as she</L>
<L>Would make a Heav'n e'en of this desert isle!</L></Q></P>
<P>And when he first sees the ship, he exclaims,
<Q><L>O, Setebos!</L>
<L>What glorious thing is yon', as mountain huge!</L>
<L>Doth firmly rest upon th'unstable sea?</L>
<L>Fanning, with flickering top, the welkin's cheek!</L>
<L>'Tis sure some god, is come to bear us hence,</L>
<L>To Milan; which I rightly judg'd was Heav'n!</L></Q></P>

<L>Did make me so while I did worship him.</L>
<L>Must I be ever thus for nothing chid!</L>
<P>Prospero, to punish his relapse, enjoins him to remain on the deck, with the others who had offended him, all night.</P>
<P>They endeavour to sooth, and reconcile Caliban to what they have brought on him, by some com∣mon-place jests; but the monster, not being now in a joking humour, says—
<Q><L>Peace, ye dull fools! I will no more endure</L>
<L>This scurvy jesting;—ye are base and false!</L>
<L>Ye first, like fiends, seduce, and then betray!</L>
<L>Beware, foul traitors, how henceforth ye mock;</L>
<L>Lest into both I strike my sharpen'd sangs,</L>
<L>And 'gainst each other dash ye, mongrels, dead!</L></Q></P>
<P>They pacify him at length, by promising to devise some revenge against Prospero; and he exclaims,—
<Q><L>The thought of that would make me brave the night,</L>
<L>Tho' livid light'nings, darting, singed my head;</L>
<L>And rifted rocks 'mid yesty waves o'erdash'd!</L></Q></P>
<P>He is, at length, wrought into good humour; and the second act concludes with their singing

<Q><L>"Flout 'em, and skout 'em; and skout 'em, and flout 'em;</L>
<L>"Thought is free."</L></Q></P>
<P>The <HI>"gentle Readerres"</HI> must suppose other scenes to have intervened; but Caliban being so unique a character, I was solicitous that the extracts I procured should relate chiefly to him: in the third Act he is seen dreaming of Miranda, and talking in his sleep, on the deck;—
<Q><LG>
<L>Ho, ho! 'tis heaven!—now I am blest indeed!</L>

<P>The Spirit of his Dam, Sycorax, descends, amidst thunder, lightning, &amp;c.</P>

<L>Thou wilt not harm me, Sycorax?—lo, I kneel!</L></Q></P>
<P>Sycorax, who at her death was <HI>"doom'd for a certain term to fast in fires,"</HI> replies—

<P>Prospero and the rest, being informed of these disasters, repair to the deck; Caliban thus ex∣ults over his master:—

<P>The Scene closes, and the third act concludes with a convocation of Ariel, and other good Spirits; who having determined to counteract, if possible, the machinations of Sycorax, &amp;c. sing a hymn and chorus, expressive of their ardour in the cause of Virtue.</P>
<P>The fourth act brings us acquainted with Ab∣dallah, (in <HI>The Tempest</HI> the nameless) King of Tunis, lately married to Claribel, daughter of Alonso, king of Naples.</P>
<P>In an old geographical book in my possession, date unknown, is the following passage;—</P>
<PB N="40" REF="38"/>
<P>"This whole Countrie (at this day) is called the kingdom of <HI>Tunis:</HI> the king whereof is a kinde of stipendary unto the <HI>Turke:</HI> the people that inhabite there are generally <HI>Sarazens,</HI> and doe professe <HI>Mahomet.</HI>"</P>
<P>It has always appeared very strange to me, yet I have never met with any observation on it, that Shakspeare should so grossly have erred against the known laws and customs of nations, as to couple the daughter of a Christian king with a Maho∣metan!</P>
<P>For a royal Protestant to marry a Papist, or vice versa, required a dispensation from the Pope; but, to permit the union of a Christian princess and an infidel was, I believe, only in the power of a Poet; who could plead in extenuation, that <HI>"the truest poetry is the most feigning."</HI> We shall find, however, by this <HI>Sequel,</HI> that Shakspeare, if it be his, was not insensible of the faux pas he had committed; as the marriage is so very infe∣licitous, that the Bride, poor thing! remains a <HI>Virgin:</HI> whence the title of this chosen Play or Interlude, THE VIRGIN QUEEN.</P>
<P>"'Fore the beginning of this play," a Sorce∣ress, (formerly leagued with Sycorax, who was banished from Argier, or Algiers, to Prospero's
<PB N="41" REF="39"/>isle) was enamoured of Abdallah; he rejecting her offers of love, and marrying Claribel, the enraged witch prevents consummation; conveys the un∣happy pair by her <HI>"so potent art"</HI> from Tunis, and holds them in durance: but, for that even Magick cannot quite separate a loving married pair, they are permitted to see and converse with each other daily.</P>
