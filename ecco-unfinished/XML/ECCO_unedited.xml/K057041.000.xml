<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE bare Mention of the
Person, whose Diary and
Letters are now publish∣ed,
may sufficiently sa∣tisfie
the World from
whence they originally
came, and where they are still preserv∣ed:
The Copy, from whence these Papers
are published, is in the Hand-Writing of
<HI>ROBERT PLOT,</HI> L. D. late Pro∣fessor
of Chymistry, Chief Keeper of the
<HI>Ashmolean Musaeum</HI> in the Ʋniversi∣ty
of <HI>Oxford,</HI> and Secretary of the
<PB N="vii" REF="3"/>
Royal Society, and was by him tran∣scribed
for the Ʋse of a near Relation
of Mr. <HI>Ashmole</HI>'s, a private Gentle∣man
in <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> who has been plea∣sed
to think they may be acceptable to
the World for their Exactness and Sin∣gularity.
They were collated a few Years
since by <HI>David Parry,</HI> M. A. of <HI>Je∣sus</HI>
College in <HI>Oxford,</HI> and Head-Keeper
of the same Place, who correct∣ed
from the original Manuscript<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Inter M. S. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Num. 1136.</NOTE>
some few literal Errors. The Chara∣cter
of Mr. <HI>Ashmole</HI> is so well known,
and so excellently, though concisely
drawn in these Papers, as well as in
that Article published under his Name,
in the <HI>Supplement</HI> to the learned Mr.
<HI>Collier</HI>'s Historical Dictionary, partly
extracted from these Materials by
the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> celebrated Mr. <HI>Edward
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>wyd,</HI> Superior Bedel of Divinity
in the Ʋniversity of <HI>Oxford,</HI> that no
Recommendation of an obscure Editor
can be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any Service, after so noted
<PB N="viii" REF="4"/>
Names: The Ʋsefulness of this Kind
of Works I shall not descant upon; but
only say thus much, That they let us
into the secret History of the Affairs of
their several Times: Discover the Springs
of Motion, and display many valuable,
though minute Circumstances overlooked,
or unknown to our general Historians,
and to conclude all, satiate our largest
Curiosity.</P>

My Father was Born upon a <HI>Whitsunday</HI> in

<P>He was bred up by his Father to his Trade;
yet when he came to Man's Estate, followed it
but little: He more affected War, than his
Profession, and spent many of his Years abroad,
which drew on him a Course of Expences and
Ill-Husbandry. His first Voyage was into
<HI>Ireland,</HI> with <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Essez, Anno</HI> 159...
Two other Voyages he afterwards made, with
his Son, <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> into the Palati∣nate,
from whom he received good Respect.
He was an honest fair Conditioned Man, and

became a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Enemy to himself and poor Fa∣mily.</P>

cloathed in its Delivery, with all those Rich
Circumstances of Advantage, that could possi∣bly
either enable the Gift to bespeak the Good∣ness
and Prudence of the Giver, or invite the

<OPENER><SALUTE><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHatever Interest this City and Church
have in your Birth and Education,
hath already redounded, in so much Honour
thereby, and in your continual Bounty, to
both: That we have not the Confidence to
back with that Topick, this our Petition for
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our free Gift, towards finishing the Ring of
Ten Bells, instead of our former Six bad and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ones. Nor, in Truth, have we any
o∣ther
Arguments, but your Charity and our
Necessity; of the former, you have given us
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Proof<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as we acknowledge with all
Thankfulness. And of the latter, we have
too much, through the Misfortunes of the
Work. The Deceitfulness of the Ground first
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Bell-Founder lose his cast∣ing
the hour biggest, to the Damage of 30 <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.
and now his Error in oversizing the Eight
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, he hath cast▪ so far that they have swal∣lowed
up all the Metal for the Ten; and that
<PB N="99" REF="103"/>
requires 80 l. more to be added to our poor
Fund for the two other Bells, proportionable
to that Bigness. But yet an Error so much
on the better Hand, that would make extream∣ly
for the Advantage and Glory of the Ca∣thedral
(the Bigness of such a Ring far more
besitting the Place; and these Eight being
judged so very good, that all are loth to have
them broken, and cast into less) if possibly
that additional Sum could be raised. To this
Purpose Es{que} <HI>Diot,</HI> Mr. <HI>Walmisley,</HI> the Sub-Chantor,
and other Vicars, and Ringers are
most industriously undertaking a new Colle∣ction,
and We and several others are willing
a-new to contribute, and if you will please to
put to the helping Hand of your Piety and
Munificence; you will add signally to those In∣stances
thereof already in our publick Cata∣logue
of Benefactors, and will highly oblige
both those zealous Undertakers, and especially,</P>
