</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AN army and nation standing upon the foundation of a rational and pious hope of divine aid; and united in defence of honor, innocence and justice; should never despair of obtaining success. For they, whose principles of warfare are tru∣ly benevolent and righteous, will in the end find themselves triumphant over the in∣justice of tyrants, and all their minions and armed slaves.</P>
<P>Such considerations have often, in adver∣sity, consoled the minds of those advocates for the interests of men, who esteem them∣selves most dignified when they are num∣bered
<PB N="6" REF="017531_0004_0FA127686EF1A788"/>
among the true friends to their country.</P>
<P>In further introducing what I intend to perform on this auspicious day, let me hope to offend no one by reciting a part of those orders which where addressed to this army, and seem to accord well with the senti∣ments just expressed. The general orders which only a short time preceded our ope∣rations against the army commanded by earl Cornwallis, shew a virtuous dependence on heaven and say, "We have prospects, which, UNDER THE SMILES OF HEAVEN, promise to crown our toils with the most brilliant success."</P>
<P>This was an honorable and public decla∣ration, that the influences of Almighty power were necessary in order to give us a fair prospect of victory; this was an humble invocation of the divine favor: and heaven has smiled upon the exertions of our com∣bined forces, and "the Lord," in the stile of the text, "hath helped us."</P>
<P>The sacred penman of the history of the prophet Samuel informs us, that this pi∣ous and illustrious person was, in a very remarkable manner, raised up to judge and govern the Jewish nation. He was the gift of God to reward the prayers of piety, and was by his parents early devoted to the service of God and his country.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="017531_0005_0FA12769EF1D89E8"/>
But before I enter fully into a discussion of the subject, we may take notice, that during a considerable length of time which preceded the government of Samuel, the Jewish nation had very much degenerated in their customs and manners. Vice and iniquity so abounded throughout the nation, that scarcely could the vision of truth, mer∣cy or justice be perceived either among priests or prophets, judges or people. The judgments of Heaven had collected and kindled over the heads of a people who, with very few exceptions, had forsak∣en their God, and united their sins to draw down whole stores of punishment from the very hands of mercy and goodness. Let rulers and nations know their fate when they neglect or despise their God.</P>
<P>In a word, the Israelites were sorely op∣pressed by the Philistines. They had been defeated in repeated battles; their young men, and judges, and armies were slain; the ark of God was taken, and "the glory had departed from Israel." The hand of God was also immediately against them, to punish them for their sins; and "he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men. And the people lamented say∣ing, Who is able to stand before this Holy Lord God?"</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="017531_0006_0FA1276AACE7CDC8"/>
At this time of universal calamity, Samu∣el rose up and judged the children of Israel.</P>
<P>"Prepare your hearts unto the Lord," said the prophet, "and serve him only: and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Phi∣listines." By the prayers and intercessions of this man of God, and the penitent re∣turning of the people unto the Lord, the aid of omnipotence was allied to their cause: "For when the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel, the Lord thunder∣ed with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them, and they were smitten before Israel. And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pur∣sued the Philistines and smote them."</P>
<P>"Then Samuel took a stone, and set it be∣tween Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto hath the Lord helped us."</P>
<P>I now beg your further attention, my dearly beloved hearers, while I attempt to illustrate the meaning of the words, which I have chosen for the assistance of your de∣votions on this joyful day.</P>
<P>"Hitherto hath the Lord helped us. By these words we are called to a devout con∣sideration of our dependence on the Al∣mighty God, and to a recollection of the many instances of help and relief with which he has condescended to bless us.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="017531_0007_0FA1276C6FC03A58"/>
"Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Ebenezer."</P>
<P>This was intended to manifest the grate∣ful sense they entertained of the merciful deliverance which God had granted them, and their earnest desire of perpetuating their praise and gratitude to nations then unborn. This part of the subject shall solicit our care and attention in the second place.</P>
<P>What I have in view, as we advance in the business of this day, is, in the first place, to illustrate that part of the text which in∣forms us, that "Hitherto hath the Lord helped us."</P>
<P>Here, perhaps, it may be asked, does this subject require any illustration before men of thought and reflection? Are not all men, it may be said, persuaded by the force of reason that the supreme being has supported and preserved them in every stage of life? But shall there be many found notwithstanding this persuasion, who have neglected to pay their dutiful homage to the most merciful guardian and benefac∣tor of mankind? If this be so, I shall not do wrong, when I endeavour to make my fellow-men sensibly feel their dependence on the creator as well as acknowledge this truth. I will then both wish and attempt to remind them, that they can be in no situa∣tion
<PB N="10" REF="017531_0008_0FA1276CEE3D0558"/>
where the aid of the creator is not the existence of the creature: That we may give weight to this sentiment, let us view man∣kind when they first awake into this world of toil and hazard. All the weaknesses and imperfections of infancy attend them. They are, in themselves considered, most deplorably helpless. The very animals of the field may, with great propriety, laugh at this feeble creature man, and boast of their superior strength and independence. Nor is man helpless only in this dawn of life. Even when he has reached the utmost strength and wisdom within the attainment of human nature; yet he must still confess that safety is not derived from himself. For it will ever be found that, we can neither foresee nor overcome all the toils and dangers which await us in our passage through life.</P>
<P>Every man must therefore feel himself lonely and melancholy in this world, until he has confided in one whose power can protect him, and whose wisdom can guide him into the pleasant paths of glory and fe∣licity. This sentiment seems to be born with us and not merely the effect of teach∣ing; the voice of nature and not the la∣boured acquisition of philosophy. It is a truth authorized and supported by the testi∣mony of much the greater part of mankind
<PB N="11" REF="017531_0009_0FA1276DB015A1A0"/>
in all ages of the world. Were we to call for the opinion of those nations, not ac∣quainted with the knowledge of the true God, and ask the religious pages of their histories; there we should be informed that their greatest support and consolation amidst the common or extraordinary vicissi∣tudes of life, were founded on the supposed goodness, wisdom and power of those be∣ings to whom, in their unenlightened zeal, they attributed the government of the world and its numerous inhabitants. Let us a little farther follow the doctrine of our personal dependence on the supreme being. We will for a moment reflect on some of the circumstances of our lives, and what smiling prospects of human felicity have presented themselves before us. Upon recollecting their instability and painful delusion we are constrained to say, that neither what immediately respects ourselves nor the affairs of the world are under our controul or direction. Is not every man able to say, that a thousand disappointments have attended him in the transactions of life, and all of them perhaps quite contrary to his most lively hopes and expectations. What appeared perfectly just and proper at one time, has nevertheless afterwards as∣sumed a very different aspect.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="017531_0010_0FA1276E6D4E8A90"/>
We have seen the best human abilities and the oldest experience fall under the weightiest disappointment. Schemes which were in appearance well calculated to pro∣duce favorable events in the concerns of life, have nevertheless proved abortive.</P>
<P>Nor will it appear, upon examination, that nations or kingdoms have any stable foundation for their support, independent of the Sovereign Governor of the universe. All their combined wisdom and strength are subject to the direction of that Omniscience which perfectly comprehends every tenden∣cy of the councils of men. None of those plans of operation, which are founded upon our imperfect knowledge of future events, and the scanty experience of past ages, can, with any certainty, promise great success. Of this truth the greater part of mankind have been very sensible; for they saw such national events take place among them as were evidently of a magnitude too great to be accomplished by any human means. A conviction of this kind induced many nati∣ons, which can be named, to begin all public business of importance with public acts of worship. We are also assured, that they never declared war, nor undertook any ha∣zardous enterprise, or entered the field of battle, without imploring the aid and directi∣on of supernatural power. Influenced by
<PB N="13" REF="017531_0011_0FA1276F2DC19F80"/>
these religious sentiments, their generals, and officers, and soldiers, have performed many things which were astonishing, and much above all that could, with reason, be expected from human strength and sagacity. In the support of this declaration, I am rich∣ly furnished with the venerable authority of ancient historians and eminent statesmen. They teach us, that the hope of divine aid was the noblest incentive to valour and reso∣lution in the field of war, and gained them the most important victories. The courage of the soldiers was animated by piety, and their fears dispelled by a firm reliance on heaven. And both sacred and prophane authors inform us, that commanders of ar∣mies have been attended by victory no lon∣ger than they thought an alliance with hea∣ven was necessary. Here I think we may, with advantage, recollect the conduct and vanity of a certain Grecian general: when among his companions, and recounting the victories which were gained under his com∣mand, he often ascribed the success of his army to his own good management and cou∣rage, and frequently said, "and in this for∣tune had no share." Afterwards he never prospered in any thing which he undertook. The same instruction may be derived from the infamy and ruin of the Pharaohs, the Senacheribs and Herods of all ages. These
<PB N="14" REF="017531_0012_0FA1276FECC43480"/>
are the men who defy the powers of heaven and earth, and seem to challenge the utmost exertions of Omnipotence. They carry with them the marks of weakness and pre∣sumption, and are followed by ruin and confusion. On the contrary, those nations and commanders who placed the greatest confidence in Almighty God, have been most victorious and most flourishing. This is a truth which cannot be justly contradict∣ed; and this is a truth from which America ought to learn her happiness as a nation. When a lively confidence in God springs from the source of a warm and enlightened heart, and this confidence is aided by our most skilful and most vigorous exertions, then may we entertain a well grounded hope that we shall be blessed with help from on high. This rational hope of divine aid will beget fortitude in danger, patience under hardships, chearfulness and pleasure in pro∣sperity, and modesty and mercy amidst all the triumphs of victory. Hear what the sacred scriptures say to those who acknowledge the providence of God; who are obedient to his commands; who confide in his goodness and power; and who humbly ask his aid and direction. "Then shall no man be able to stand before you: for he Lord your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon."</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="017531_0013_0FA12770AD3EA058"/>
Therefore, a righteous people may encou∣rage themselves when they oppose their un∣just enemies; and, while they adopt the fol∣lowing language of the sacred volume, may rejoice and say, "With them is an arm of flesh; but with us is the Lord our God to help us and to fight our battles."</P>
<P>With these words I close what I have thus far designed. They are able to support my honest exertions in the cause of justice and religion. I ask their aid, and earnestly wish our minds may be ever impressed with a weighty sense of our needed help from Almighty God.</P>
<P>In the farther discussion of my subject, I will recollect some of the past mercies which have been extended to us by our gracious God. Suffer me to say, they are sufficient to inforce on our minds both a per∣sonal and national application of the words of the text; "Hitherto hath the Lord help∣ed us."</P>
<P>Who, that considers the weakness of hu∣man nature, and how much it is exposed; who, that reflects on the journey of man through this world, or marks the various circumstances which visibly attend his life: I say, in the midst of these sober thoughts, who does not find himself constrained to give his grateful assent to this declaration of one of the holy prophets: "It is of the
<PB N="16" REF="017531_0014_0FA127716F549B90"/>
Lord's mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.?"</P>
<P>Were it possible to disclose the histories of our lives; could we rehearse the hazards of infancy and childhood, and recount the toils and dangers which have kept pace with the increase of our years; or, to go yet fur∣ther, were it in our power to enumerate not only the open and professed enemies of our lives and happiness, but also to enter into the secret ambushments of our concealed foes, and to point out our narrow escape from evils against which we could not guard, methinks there would be very few pages in this history without a "Hitherto hath the Lord helped us." It is said, "In the midst of life we are in death;" and indeed death in a thousand dismal forms continually sur∣rounds us. His arrows fly thick at all times; and it can be owing only to the guardianship of heaven that they have not been aimed at us, and fastened in our vitals. Every morn∣ing and evening we can only say, that we have lived, but are uncertain of the con∣sequences of the next hour. But these are not all: how many thousand precious gifts are we blessed with from the hands of our bountiful benefactor? He gives us life, and all the blessings of it. "In his hand is our breath, and are all our ways." Let each one of us say, then, in the inward gratitude of
<PB N="17" REF="017531_0015_0FA12772310EA7A0"/>
our hearts, "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits. Who forgiveth all thine iniquities: who healeth all thy dis∣eases. Who redeemeth thy life from de∣struction: who crowneth thee with loving kindness and tender mercies."</P>
<P>But I correct myself. I check that gene∣ral zeal of gratitude which may another day be more indulged. I came not, my friends, to exhaust your whole time by addressing you on those subjects of gratitude which have a common relation to the particular and personal situation of every one present. This employment, however pleasing and ra∣tional, must submit to claim only a future, though a more enlarged attention.</P>
<P>The voice of authority among men, calls us to diffuse a general joy and gratitude through our hearts, and the hearts of the ge∣nerous sons of freedom. Nay, the voice of God, in his providential goodness, demands our thankful homage for a national and most signal blessing; yes, and for repeated bless∣ings. Let us then, whether under the hea∣ven's spacious concave, or in the sacred tem∣ple, let us worship the King of heaven and earth, and adore his mercy and power, which have given us the victory over our enemies.</P>
<P>Could we give a general utterance to the united states of America; could the voice of her annals and records be heard on this glad
<PB N="18" REF="017531_0016_0FA12772EE387948"/>
day: or, were our pious ancestors to appear before us to aid our praise and increase our devotions, they would all, with one harmo∣nious voice, unite with this assembly in pro∣claiming, that "Hitherto hath the Lord helped us."</P>
<P>Join then, friends and brethren of Ame∣rica! join in heart and spirit, ye patriots and friends to posterity, and form one general concert of praise to HIM who has aided us! Time and history, who point out to the world the ways of God, ye shall teach men that the Father of the oppressed became the advocate of the inhabitants of this land! "He found them in a desart land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led them about, he instructed them, he kept them as the apple of his eye."</P>
<P>As a vine is planted, so, O God of hosts, thy hand did establish a people in this land. "The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs there∣of were like the goodly cedars. She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river."</P>
<P>But tyranny, which raged against this people in their infancy, again prepared ca∣lamity and oppression for them: and, not∣withstanding our enemies enjoyed the fruits of our industry and virtue, and grew great by the labour of those they had exiled;
<PB N="19" REF="017531_0017_0FA12774FA58CC50"/>
yet they became envious of the happiness, and jealous of the flourishing state of those who were befriended only by their God. In the spirit and style of Egyptian tyranny, they call upon one another to unite in mea∣sures of cruelty and injustice. "Come on," say they, "let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply. Therefore they did set over them taskmasters, to afflict them with their burdens." Such was the conduct of Britain towards the inhabitants of this continent. But the Lord helped us, and their secret councils and schemes, the most wisely plan∣ned, at least in the eye of human wisdom, were turned into foolishness.</P>
<P>The Lord raised up wise and public spi∣rited men, able to discern our rights and privileges, and willing to defend them. The Lord raised up warriors and statesmen, and united their hearts and strengthened their hands in the service of their country. Our enemies were disappointed; they de∣spaired of success, unless by their superior strength and skill in the field of war.</P>
<P>Ministerial avarice, arrayed in rigorous acts and unjust laws, suddenly changed into British vengeance; and then hostile armies advanced to enforce submission by the wea∣pons of death and the shedding of blood.</P>
<P>Then was war in the gates. Was there a shield or a spear seen among forty thousand
<PB N="20" REF="017531_0018_0FA12775313C8DA0"/>
in America? But with joy, with praise we will say, "The battle is not to the strong, nor the race to the swift. My heart is to∣ward those that offered themselves willingly among the people. Praise ye the Lord. O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good. Who remembered us in our low estate: for his mercy endureth for ever."</P>
<P>Will any one blame me for honestly at∣tempting to kindle the warmth of this day's gratitude into a generous and perpetual flame; a flame which, like the refiner's fire, shall purify our hearts and consciences from all evil, and consume the dross of every sinful practice and impure affection?</P>
<P>Let, then, our gratitude be increased, by a recollection of the unexpected and asto∣nishing union of the inhabitants and states of America, in opposition to the usurpation of Britain. We will call to mind some of those gallant actions in which the assisting hand of heaven has appeared, and the wis∣dom and courage of our armies were con∣spicuous.</P>
<P>Seven dangerous and laborious cam∣paigns shall aid my feeble voice. Ye well fought fields of battle, and ye joyful victo∣ries, from the heights of Boston to the plains of Georgia, ye shall all conspire to prove, that the Lord hath helped us.</P>
<P>Begin we then with the nineteenth of
<PB N="21" REF="017531_0019_0FA12775EDBD2EC8"/>
April, memorable for the first open and bloody assault on the liberties of this conti∣nent. Oh! Americans, forget not to tell your children, that liberty was on that day marked for the slaughter, and appointed to bleed on the altars of avarice and tyranny! Oh! ye parents, tell your young offspring, as they rise under your tender and instruct∣ive care, tell them, they were devoted to slavery! teach them what a heavy curse it is! let them know what miseries they have escaped! kindle their young minds to a man∣ly and generous love of freedom; but let a dignified resentment against every system of slavery grow with their growth, and strength∣en with their years. Let them hear of the cruelties of Britain; let them listen to those narratives of war and battles, till the name of Britain and slavery shall make the blood thrill in their veins; let them attend to these tales of horror, until a martial spirit shall mingle with their blood, and glow in their faces, in an aspect daring and resolute as the front of the Libyan lion.</P>
<P>In the temples of that beneficent Being, who delighteth not in the miseries of man∣kind, in his temples let the sound of liberty be lifted up, as well as the seraphic voice of religion; let them give force, and influence, and happiness to each other. Let the bene∣volent preacher teach his people to esteem the
<PB N="22" REF="017531_0020_0FA12776AEEDC370"/>
blessings of liberty, and to be religious and thankful; let him also require them to re∣gard their freedom as one of these blessings: but to consider voluntary slavery as the most dreadful curse that can be inflicted on man∣kind.</P>
<P>But I return to consider what has been done between the ever memorable 19th of April, 1775, and the joyful 19th of Octo∣ber, 1781.</P>
<P>Following the example of the holy scrip∣tures, and humbly aiming at what the judges, and the prophets, and the divine poets have done, fain would I bring into view every re∣markable interposition of heaven, and, in the words of the grateful psalmist, close eve∣ry period of mercy and deliverance with "Praise the Lord, who hath redeemed us from our enemies: for his mercy endureth for ever."</P>
<P>Hear then, citizens and fellow soldiers, what was done on Bunker's hill: that place shall claim a splendid page in history, from that time, when virtuous citizens so gal∣lantly opposed British troops, and humbled their proud contempt of the American arms.</P>
<P>In Canada, though there the brave have fallen, have sunk to rest, yet in the early stage of this war, very important success attended our arms: strong fortresses and British troops
<PB N="23" REF="017531_0021_0FA1277770CFAE88"/>
were compelled to acknowledge the prowess of our forces.</P>
<P>From thence, in imagination, let us pass to our army before Boston: there the ene∣my were forced to look for safety by the eva∣cuation of that place.</P>
<P>That year the war was carried into the state of New York: then did our enemies hasten from the other side of the ocean to join their brethren, already engaged, to make so large a portion of mankind misera∣ble. Number the enemy from Britain! number them from Hesse! number their ships of war! Describe, if you can, all the awful engines of death and carnage! At this time, Oh, my brethren! who taught you to hope that you could be free and independ∣ent? who preserved you from falling at the feet of Britain?</P>
<P>But see the waters, though not, "like the Red sea," divided into parts, yet favourable to us in a time of distress and danger. The very winds in the hand of God granted their aid to save our army. That night which bro't our troops from Long island to New York, shall be foremost in giving an example of the most interesting and finished retreat from the most imminent military ruin.</P>
<P>That year Clinton and Parker felt the weight of American bravery; and being de∣feated and miserably shattered, were obliged
<PB N="24" REF="017531_0022_0FA127782F190D78"/>
to relinquish their southern expedition. This campaign wore away, and saw no extraordi∣nary success attend the numerous forces and the powerful fleet of the enemy; unless to murder a garrison of brave men after they had capitulated, may be called extraordinary success.</P>
<P>Oh! ye first fruits of American fortitude and perseverance, let me, in imagination, drop the tear of love and compassion over your honourable graves, if your iron hearted enemies gave you any! Ye martyrs for the cause of freedom, whose steady souls could never bend even to a partial and momentary desertion of your principles of virtue, nei∣ther the fair promises of your enemies were able to allure you, nor the unutterable hor∣rors of the most execrable prisons and cruel∣ties; not death in his slow and ghastly ap∣proaches; not the lingering death of hun∣ger and torture could terrify you from your fixed attachment to your country! Oh! were it consistent with the will of heaven, I would say, arise, and come from the dead, to behold a large army of your enemies con∣quered! arise, and animate your country∣men to finish the glorious work of liberty! arise, and lead on your brother soldiers to dreadful deeds of death and slaughter, until the ruthless hand of Britain shall no more disturb the peace of men.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="017531_0023_0FA12778EE45FA50"/>
We will now pass on to a view of the A∣merican army. It was almost disbanded; it was reduced to a small number, and better fitted to draw forth pity and compassion from the beholders, than to strike them with terror; more able to show their fortitude in adversity, than to do execution with their arms! Why, O Cornwallis, didst thou not seize the feeble warriors, and their perse∣vering commander? Then who can say thy present fate would not have been suspended?</P>
<P>Next go with me, I beseech you, thro' one of the storms and tempests of nature. Follow the march of a few naked men, or if they were clothed it was only with rags, exposed to the rigors of December's cold. O liberty! by what charm, or what mag∣netic power, didst thou hold these suffering men firm in thy interest? But follow them to the capture of a large body of Hessians at Trenton. From thence pass on with the troops to Princeton; and in your way learn the resources and stratagems of war, and hear of the disappointment and confu∣sion of the enemy. Princeton, that once peaceful abode of the muses, and seat of science, then heard unusual thunders, and saw Britons defeated and slain. Then the dying lamp of liberty was kindled anew! Thousands of heroes flew to the standards
<PB N="26" REF="017531_0024_0FA12779AE93FEF8"/>
of freedom, and thought she could be still defended.</P>
<P>An American army again took the field, and the enemy found they had the war to begin anew.</P>
<P>Near the close of this year, the Almigh∣ty, "who had not given us as a prey to their teeth," remarkably helped us, and gave Burgoyne and all his army into the hands of the United States.</P>
<P>Let a recollection of the mercies of the next year begin with a declaration of the alliance of America with the magnanimous Lewis XVI. The illustrious hero, and friend to the rights of mankind, heard the fame of our cause, and joined the interest of his kingdom to the support of our inde∣pendence, and has spared neither blood nor wealth to establish us in the possession of our freedom.</P>
<P>From this subject, let the operations of our army, numerous and gallant, demand our attention. Consider their formidable movements to the fields of Monmouth. There, my fellow soldiers, you remember the fortune of the day was torn from the hands of the victorious enemy, and the flower of their army. Methinks I shall not do amiss, by leaving you to apply the words, of the poet, where they were deserved on that day:</P>

"To fainting squadrons sent the timely aid, Inspir'd repuls'd battalions to engage, And taught the doubtful battle where to rage."</P>
<P>From the battle of Monmouth, and the various operations of the army within the fourth year of this war, we pass on to the succeeding campaign. No small success fa∣voured our arms that year. Paulus-Hook and Stoney-Point taught our enemies that their strong fortresses were not impregna∣ble to the intrepid resolution and the impe∣tuous assaults of the American forces. In the same year an important expedition was directed against the five nations of hostile indians. That expedition, though attend∣ed with immense toil and difficulty, and rendered exceedingly precarious by a great number of hazardous circumstances, a few of which, in their operations, could have destroyed the troops on that service: That expedition was not without success; and what men could perform, was done.</P>
<P>But I hasten to the sixth campaign, and remind you of what happened on the 25th of September in the year past. That day should have a place in the calendars of all ages, to inform mankind what human na∣ture can attempt. Then were disclosed, as it were, the secret plots of hell; and trea∣son
<PB N="28" REF="017531_0026_0FA1277C10685910"/>
too big to be any longer confined, burst from its concealment. Let that day be numbered among the days of mercy; let it constitute an annual festival of grateful joy; and let liberty and the glad angels of America, hover round the assembled sons of freedom, and inspire them with a love of vir∣tue and honor, and a lasting remembrance of the goodness of God, who with scarcely any human means, and by very little human saga∣city, discovered treasonable plots when they were upon the very point of execution. Then did the Almighty save the commander of our armies, and the most important fort∣ress and a part of our troops, from the very jaws of treason and our enemies. On this subject, I know you will anticipate me, and think sooner than I can say, "Hitherto hath the Lord helped us." How wonderful and mysterious the just and merciful ways of heaven." We have been suffered to stand upon the very precipice of ruin, before we were delivered from our danger. This, we ought to believe, was mercifully intended to teach us our dependence upon him, who alone can make a nation flourish; this was to make us grateful, that we might be happy. But how many subjects of grati∣tude have I omitted! How many which I cannot bring into view on this day! The grateful heart will recollect more than I
<PB N="29" REF="017531_0027_0FA1277CAD9EB218"/>
can utter. How various have been the con∣flicts between us and the enemy, superior to us in strength or numbers in almost eve∣ry instance? But though in various places success has not attended us; yet the con∣quests of the enemy have been few, and of short duration. Nay, the very victories they have boasted of, only hastened their ruin. For the confirmation of this truth, let us bring examples from the southern part of the continent. We will admire the enterprizing and persevering spirit of our southern army, who in the midst of the enemy's victories have destroyed their ar∣my. North and South Carolina shall pro∣claim the military sagacity and intrepidity of general Green, and his faithful band of worthies. Those states shall repeat the vic∣tories which have been gained by that army; they shall remember how many fortresses have been wrested out of the hands of an insulting enemy, vainly elated with their visionary success. The late important vic∣tory obtained by the troops under the com∣mand of general Green, shall aid the joy and praise of this day, and increase our gratitude.</P>
<P>But here let me pause a moment. Per∣haps upon reflection I may find reason to say, that I have aimed at more than can be performed in the short time that is allotted
<PB N="30" REF="017531_0028_0FA1277D6EBC7270"/>
to the public worship of this day. Pardon me then, my dearly beloved brethren, if I have detained you too long from what ap∣pears to be the more immediate intention of this assembly. I imagined my text meant more than to acknowledge only one victory, or one instance of the goodness of God, however great the blessing might be. When our hearts are truly grateful, they are also ge∣nerous and enlarged. We wish to know how much heaven has bestowed upon us, and how much the debts of gratitude are accumulat∣ed; and even when we find that the com∣putation will rise infinitely above our abili∣ties to make any equal compensation; and that every new mercy will render us more eternally insolvent; yet still the grateful soul is most delighted, when the contem∣plation of the mercy and goodness of God is most extensive; and must, after all we can say or do, end with this pathetic and thankful enquiry, which it will not be easy to answer, "What shall I render unto the Lord, for all his benefits towards me?"</P>
<P>This shall prepare our hearts for a new subject of gratitude. We will now enter upon the pleasing employment of impres∣sing our minds with a pleasing remembrance of the last national blessing, which heaven has vouchsafed unto us.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="017531_0029_0FA1277E2F992288"/>
Shall I not venture to say, that no ex∣pedition which depended, in the first plan of it, upon forces so much disjoined, and events so precarious, was ever blessed with a more seasonable and harmonious junction of prosperous circumstances, or ended with more substantial glory and complete suc∣cess. The first transient view of that expe∣dition seems to impose upon us the pre∣sumptuous notion of having in our hands the command of the winds and the waves, the rains and the tempests, any of which, under the orders of heaven, would have rendered our plans of operation altogether ineffectual.</P>
<P>O Clinton! did your tory spies, those evil geniuses of America, who are employ∣ed in "going to and fro in the earth, seek∣ing whom they may devour;" did they fail to announce to you the early destination of the combined army? Alas! was there no friend to Britain able to inform Corn∣wallis of his approaching danger? To us this is a happy consideration, it is a mark of military skill. Secresy! thou life and soul of every warlike enterprise, ever deign to envelop the designs of our army in a cloud, which, as of old, shall be darkness to the enemy, but, like a pillar of fire, shall give light to the children of America.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="017531_0030_0FA1277EEDFC1070"/>
But I come to observe, that from the time our army was ordered on the expedi∣tion into Virginia, until the day on which the enemy surrendered, scarcely any cir∣cumstances attended the allied forces which could be deemed unfavourable. The cheer∣fulness and patience of the troops under the fatigue of long and rapid marches; the spirit of enterprise; the willingness to en∣dure labours and hardships of every kind, in order to promote the service of this country, and subdue the enemy; these were all favourable omens, and are worthy of our attention and regard. The critical and seasonable arrival of the fleet under the command of his excellency the count de Grasse; and this before the enemy entered the Chesapeak, and by their prior possession of the bay made the junction of our army and the French fleet very difficult, if not altogether impracticable. But the situation of the fleet under count de Barras, yet at sea, was very critical and dangerous. The enemy appeared at the entrance of the Chesapeak to intercept his arrival. This was the time for the count de Grasse to display his abili∣ties, and to prove how much can be done by a seasonable, well directed, and impetu∣ous attack. By a most gallant manoeuvre, he defeated the enemy, destroyed some of their men of war, and drove the rest in
<PB N="33" REF="017531_0031_0FA1277FAE8E80B8"/>
flight far to sea. By this happy victory, a junction of the two French fleets was ac∣complished, and under the divine auspi∣ces, future success was insured to our united forces.</P>
<P>I will next speak of that harmony, that emulation, and that equal love of danger which subsisted among the allied troops; as if the same generous fire of true glory glowed in their bosoms, or one patriot soul animated them to the cheerful performance of every military duty, and to encounter every danger. Witness the emulation of those French and American troops, who at the same time entered the trenches of the enemy, and with equal intrepidity and vi∣gour of attack, stormed some of their re∣doubts.</P>
<P>That only a few of our troops have fal∣len in the reduction of the enemy, is a pleas∣ing consideration, and should contribute to make us thankful. The favourableness of the season shall be remembered, and—But short be my narration of this glorious victory, for short were the operations of the siege. A strong and numerous army of our enemy have surrendered themselves prison∣ers of war: and this signal instance of the goodness of divine providence, demands a repetition of those words which you have
<PB N="34" REF="017531_0032_0FA1278179FA29C0"/>
already often heard; "Hitherto hath the Lord helped us."</P>
<P>O Virginia! highly favoured of the Lord, rejoice and be glad, for the spoiler is taken captive! Turn your fears and la∣mentations into grateful songs of praise, and forget not to love and adore that Almighty Being who says to the rage and cruelty of men, "Hitherto shalt thou go, and no farther."</P>
<P>O! all ye inhabitants of the united states, let your thankfulness appear by the piety of your hearts, and the purity of your lives. Every new instance of the goodness of the Creator, calls upon us to give new signs of our love and obedience to him. We should endeavour to shew ourselves as worthy of the mercies of God, as human nature is capable, by being more virtuous, more dutiful, and more benevolent.</P>
<P>What will all the most pompous appear∣ances of gratitude avail, if the manners and customs of our country are not pure; or the vices not reformed? Believe it, my friends, a sinful people cannot be a grate∣ful people! For be assured that a people who cannot be moved by the mercy, and goodness of God to do what is their duty, and to examine by what means they may please their Maker and bountiful Benefactor, are truly unworthy of his mercy and protection:
<PB N="35" REF="017531_0033_0FA12781F05DE5A0"/>
Nay, every part of their conduct which is vicious, seems very loudly to declare, that they are weary of the very goodness of God, and all the blessings of heaven.</P>
<P>Having now finished what I proposed in the first grand division of my discourse, I proceed to what I said should solicit our at∣tention in the second place.</P>
<P>"Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen." I have al∣ready hinted, that by this monumental stone, the children of Israel intended, not only to express their present gratitude, for favours conferred upon them by divine pro∣vidence, but also to perpetuate the remem∣brance of a very extraordinary mercy, to nations long after to be born. That this was the manner of perpetuating the me∣mory of signal success, or extraordinary events, is made evident by the testimony of every ancient historian, whether sacred or prophane. This custom, however, has not been altogether confined to the ancients. Many are the pillars and monuments which stand, this day, as witnesses of great success or of illustrious merit: and America is not without her monuments of great and wor∣thy men, who have generously shed their blood in the defence of their country. I therefore think it not difficult to shew that public and lasting signs of praise to God,
<PB N="36" REF="017531_0034_0FA12782AFB6D418"/>
as well as marks of respect for worthy men, have been authorised by the examples of all nations. Let then the enemy to religi∣on; let the enemy to his country; nay, let the vicious infidel, and the debauched libertine, let them all cease to stigmatise public and devout homage to almighty God with the name of unnecessary and unprofi∣table parade. If they will neither hear the voice of reason, nor hearken to the sub∣lime and charming instructions of the in∣spired writings; let them, however, be taught some reverence for the Deity even from the customs of heathens and pagans, where nature spoke, in part, what nature's God hath shewed to all his rational crea∣tures. Let them ask what meant those cost∣ly sacrifices of whole hecatombs; what meant those large and expensive libations; and what meant those solemn processions to the temples of devotion? Were not all these things expressions of gratitude for the mercies they had received? However, not to say all that can be offered, on this subject, from the customs of polished nations; I can de∣rive examples of this most rational duty, from the very original inhabitants of this continent. I can avail myself of their cus∣toms to plead for those signs and expressi∣ons of gratitude, which are due to the Al∣mighty Disposer of all events.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="017531_0035_0FA127836E0EE8A8"/>
But we may be more happy than they, we are more enlightened in the knowledge and service of the blessed and good God. Our gratitude should be more pure and more spiritual than theirs. We are instruc∣ted, that he delighteth more in the humble and thankful heart, than in the most cost∣ly sacrifices. Instead then of erecting al∣tars, as of old was done, for offerings to ascend in costly incense, to represent our gratitude and praise; let pure and virtuous hearts be the altars, and love and obedience be the incense, which shall better please the Deity. Gratitude shall be written on our hearts; for this also will be more pleasing to our Divine Benefactor, than all the pomp of praise which ever was inscribed, in the largest characters, on the towering pyramid, or the solemn temple.</P>
<P>O blessed day this, which calls us to the pleasing duty of praising God for so many mercies conferred upon us! O happy day, whose sun rises not to compassionate us in some deplorable exilement from our habi∣tations, or more miserable flight from our victorious enemies! Happy sun, that rises not to light us by his sickly beams to some dire and lonely retreat; but bright shines this day, to shew the blessings of heaven and the triumphs of victory! Let us collect all the generous efforts of our souls, to form
<PB N="38" REF="017531_0036_0FA127842EF13A28"/>
one humble and grateful offering, and let it be laid on the public altar of our united and open acknowledgement of the goodness of HIM who hath helped us! In the language of the Psalmist, I will say, "Bless the Lord, O my soul; and all that is within me, bless his holy name, and forget not all his bene∣fits." O just and blessed God, has it pleas∣ed thee to check the sword of the destroy∣er; yes, and in a great measure to wrest it out of the hands of the oppressor and the tyrant! Methinks if men uttered no songs of praise to their deliverer, this continent itself would reprove their ingratitude; it would break its long silence, and become vocal in high sounding songs of praise! But our gratitude shall rise high! high as the mercy seat of heaven! O for glowing words! words from warm and glowing hearts! for words from lukewarm hearts can never ascend to heaven! Incense must be inflamed before it can rise to the skies! On this day, the enthusiasm of the grateful heart is pardonable, and a passion of praise may not be displeasing to that all-wise and merciful Being, who is acquainted with the upright intentions of the heart.</P>
<P>Great are our blessings, and many and public should be our acknowledgements of them. This I am justified in saying, not only by our own sentiments; but also by
<PB N="39" REF="017531_0037_0FA12784EDA44F98"/>
the voice of that venerable body of men, who have <HI>Recommended to the several states to set apart</HI> this day <HI>to be religiously observ∣ed as a day of</HI> THANKSGIVING <HI>and</HI> PRAY∣ER. This well corresponds with the con∣duct of Samuel and the elders of Israel. Samuel sustaining a public character, and being at the head of the elders and people, called their attention to acts of religious worship, and in the sight of all Israel raised a monument of praise to almighty God. "And after this, the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines all the days of Sa∣muel."</P>
<P>How dignified and venerable do great men appear, when they acknowledge the Supreme Being as the author of all their wisdom, greatness, and success; and lay all their shining laurels of victory at the feet of the Great Disposer of all the events of the world: And suffer me to say, that men who are endowed with the most dis∣tinguished abilities, are under the greatest obligations of gratitude to that good God, who formed them capable of serving the interests of mankind, and being his mini∣sters to support justice and mercy among the inhabitants of the earth. Happy that nation, where these vicegerents of heaven are a pure and living example of their most virtuous RECOMMENDATIONS. Who will
<PB N="40" REF="017531_0038_0FA12785AD40E278"/>
give weight and energy to their laws and resolutions, by their first and most steady personal observation of them; and shew mankind, "that virtue alone is happiness below."</P>
<P>Since then, my friends, "it hath pleased almighty God to assist and support the Uni∣ted States of America, in their important struggle for liberty against the long and continued efforts of a powerful nation;" it must be not only our indispensable duty, but our greatest interest, to perpetuate our gra∣titude, by learning righteousness. Under the invoked assistance of the same merciful God, let us prosecute this war with more unanimity and unabating resolutions. Di∣vine providence has pointed out our duty, and calls us by the most signal instance of interposition, to perform his work, and to give our enemies no rest, until they be forced to see the injustice of their intenti∣ons, and the cruelty of their warfare. Could my influence reach as far as my wishes are extended; could I appear before the inhabitants of the United States in all the irresistable majesty of ancient elocution; could I wield the thunder of Demosthenes, and arrest the lightning of Pericles; how should the nerves of opposition to our country be withered, and every American be fired into a patriot or a soldier.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="017531_0039_0FA12787A18FFEC8"/>
Ye American friends to your country, this is a year of glory and public felicity! you can now with the calm and dignified triumph of freemen look back, and smile on the toils and dangers you have sustained in this righteous conflict! You can with a pious pleasure and awe mark the goodness and wisdom of Providence! You can add pleasure and delight to all these affections of the mind by a more animated gratitude and a purer zeal! This day brings you nearer the full possession of those earthly blessings for which you have so ardently panted! Your prospects are fairer and brighter than they have ever been! and if you are not wanting to yourselves, all the blessings of freedom are yours! The Lord helps you and invites you by every nation∣al blessing to renew your exertions; to press on and gain a complete conquest over the tyranny of your enemies! But should you be disobedient to the calls and smiles of heaven; should you neglect the interest of your country; remember, you may have reason to curse your indolence and impiety when it is too late! Consider the nume∣rous inhabitants of Europe. Do they not all wish you to be free and independent? They will date their days of unmolested freedom in trade and commerce from the AE∣ra of your independence! The three potent
<PB N="42" REF="017531_0040_0FA12787F074E070"/>
nations of France and Spain and the United Provinces are all on our side; they have commenced hostilities against Britain and are preparing to humble the pride of that nation. These considerations should be motives of encouragement and new zeal; but not the grounds of sloth and inaction. Honor, justice and our national character demands our utmost exertions to prove that we are worthy to be allied to a nation who have bravely fought and generously bled in this war.</P>
<P>Oh Louis the XVI live forever! Oh that my words were like the words of an angel! I would wing them to thy ears! Or could I borrow from some guardian angel of America his swift pinions! I would hover round thy person and guard thee from all danger! I would stand before thy majesty, and in the name of America of∣fer thee the sincerest thanks of this conti∣nent, for thy fleets and thy armies, for the wisdom, and the zeal, and the bravery of thy officers and soldiers in the service of Ame∣rica! There shall be men who, like the bards and poets of old, in heroic stile, shall rehearse the immortal deeds of the allied nations and of THE DEFENDER OF THE RIGHTS OF MANKIND, LOUIS THE GRAND MONARQUE. There shall be Miriams and Deborahs; there shall be virgins and daugh∣ters

in France and America who, as among the ancient people of God, shall sing of the glorious atchievements of our combined arms; they shall praise the Lord with in∣struments of music and with the sweet me∣lody of joyful voices. Some Moeonides shall enrich his verse with the honorable names of those who commanded the com∣bined army: Or after the example of Da∣vid the renowned king of Israel, it shall be said "These be the names of the mighty men" who led forth the allied troops to subdue our enemies. Their names shall be familiar to us; they shall be sounded with pleasure. Old men shall remember them; they shall report them to their children. The grey headed soldier shall beguile the heavy hours of night with his animating his∣tory of those battles in which he fought: He shall warm his cold blood with the names of Washington, and Rochambeau, De Grasse, Barras, and St. Clair; B. Viomi∣nil, and Lincoln, Chattelux, and La Fay∣ette, C. Viominil, St. Simon, and Steuben, Lauzun, and Knox,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reader is requested to observe that these names and some sentences have been added since the discourse was first written.</NOTE> and—Oh were it possible! I would with pleasure and gra∣titude repeat the name of every worthy of∣ficer
<PB N="44" REF="017531_0042_0FA127896DA27AD8"/>
and soldier of that army; they should stand side by side and hand in hand emble∣matic of our friendship and union! I would have them written in capitals of gold! Aid me, all Ye, who with a composed joy stood on the plains of York and saw the British host lay down their arms; stamp on your faithful minds the characters of every brave officer and soldier, and hand their names down to posterity. Thus far have I endeavoured to assist you in celebrating that divine Providence which has given success to our arms; and in thanking God, who has raised up great and worthy men to aid us in this war. What you have heard has flowed I hope from an honest and lively gratitude both to God, and every friend to my country. However if, upon reflection, any one is piously fearful that I have arro∣gated too much, to the skill and valour of men; if any one thinks I have forgotten the more express business of this day which is to give thanks to God and to glorify his name; to these intimations suffer me to say; all men of merit are entitled to the approbation of their fellow men; and while we pay them the debt which is justly due to their usefulness and abilities, with a constant dependence on the influence and government of God I hope we shall not do wrong. We came hither with a view to
<PB N="45" REF="017531_0043_0FA1278A2DF73E10"/>
reverence the king of heaven and earth; to adore his wisdom, his justice, and his unmerited goodness; but more especially we have been called to acknowledge the past mercies of Providence; and I hope we most humbly and most earnestly suppli∣cate his future protection and goodness. These duties we have been engaged in, and these are delightful employments to every rational and pious mind. With these serious and pleasing words I end my discourse after beseeching you to unite with me in ardently praying that it may please the Almighty governor of the uni∣verse to hasten the time when the use of hostile weapons shall cease, and the doc∣trine of the blessed Redeemer effectually in∣fluence the minds of all men. Now to Fa∣ther, Son, and Holy Spirit be ascribed, as is most due, all power, might, majesty and dominion for ever and ever Amen.</P>
