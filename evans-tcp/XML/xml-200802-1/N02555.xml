<P>I saw by night, and behold, a man riding upon a red Horse, and he stood among the Myrtle-trees that were in the Bottom, and behind him were there red Horses, speckled and white.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><HI>GOD</HI> at sundry times, and in divers manners, spake in time past unto the <HI>Fathers</HI> by the <HI>Prophets</HI>: Sometimes he revealed his mind to the Prophets by an audible Voice; sometimes by immediate Inspirations, secret Impulses of the divine Spi∣rit, moving the holy men of <HI>God</HI> to speak; sometimes by Signs and Wonders; sometimes
<PB N="6" REF="003030_0004_0FEFAF4F75419B20"/>
by Dreams, the Representations of things to the Fancy in Sleep; and oftentimes by Visions, the Representations of things to the waking Eye; hence the Prophets were called <HI>Seers.</HI> In the last manner <HI>God</HI> spake much to the <HI>Jews</HI> by the Prophet <HI>Zechariah.</HI> Eight distinct Visions are re∣corded in this Book; the most of which were granted for the Encouragement and Comfort of <HI>God</HI>'s People, after their Return from the <HI>Baby∣lonish</HI> Captivity. In the Words of my <HI>Text,</HI> the Prophet declared to the <HI>Jews</HI> the first Vision that he receiv'd. He had before call'd them to Re∣pentance, exhorted them to turn unto God, and assur'd them that if they did so the Lord of Hosts would turn unto them. Upon their humble and penitent Confession of their Sins, and of the Justice of <HI>God</HI>'s dealings with them, <HI>Zechariah</HI> was sent to make known to them what Token, or Appearance he had seen of the Lord's retur∣ning to <HI>Jerusalem with Mercies:</HI>
<Q>I saw by Night, and behold, a Man riding, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>That we may understand this Vision, which doubtless was written for our learning, we must inquire,</P>
<P N="1">I. Who the Man was, whom the Prophet saw riding upon a red Horse, and what was signified thereby?</P>
<P N="2">II. What was intended by his standing among the Myrtle-trees that were in the Bottom?</P>
<P N="3">III. What the red Horses, speckled, and white behind him, represented?</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="003030_0005_0FEFAF51C66A5D50"/>Q. I. <HI>Who was the Man, whom Zechariah saw riding upon a red Horse, and what was signified thereby?</HI></P>
<P>A. <HI>That he was the Man Christ Jesus, who ap∣peared thus as a mighty Man of War, to protect his People, and destroy his and their Enemies.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>He was the Man Christ Jesus, whom the Pro∣phet saw riding upon a red Horse.</HI> Before the <HI>Son of God</HI> took on him the humane Nature, he on some special Occasions assum'd, and appear'd in a hu∣mane Form. Thus he exhibited himself to <HI>Abra∣ham</HI> in the Plains of <HI>Mam<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> Gen. 18. One of the three Angels, which in bodily shapes stood by <HI>Abraham,</HI> is expresly stiled JEHOVAH, which is the incommunicable Name of God; and <HI>Abraham,</HI> in his Addresses to him for <HI>Sodom,</HI> called him the Lord, and the Judge of all the Earth. Her afterwards appear'd to <HI>Joshua</HI> in the shape of a Man, as <HI>Captain of the Lord's Host, with a Sword drawn in his hand</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Josh. 5.13.</NOTE>. That must be a di∣vine Person, otherwise he would not have per∣mitted <HI>Joshua</HI> to fall on his face to the Earth, and worship him; nor have bid him loose his Shoe from off his foot, telling him that the place whereon he stood was holy, as being Consecra∣ted by the divine Presence. — So he was the Son of God whom <HI>Zechary</HI> saw by Night in the shape of a Man. We have not only the univer∣sal Consent of Expositors herein, but also such an Account given of him in our Context, as may well induce us to think that he was the <HI>Lord Jesus Christ</HI> who thus appeared. He is stiled
<PB N="8" REF="003030_0006_0FEFAF5360BA3450"/>
the <HI>Angel of the Lord</HI>; and this is one of Christ's Titles. He is so call'd, not in regard of the Na∣ture he assum'd, but the Office he undertook. The Angel of God which spake to <HI>Jacob</HI> in a Dream, is said to be the <HI>God of Bethel</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. 31.</NOTE>. With that Person in the form of a Man, <HI>Jacob</HI> wrestled a whole Night; and <HI>Hosea</HI> telleth us, that he was the <HI>Angel,</HI> and the <HI>Lord God of Hosts</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hos. 12.</NOTE>. Christ is the <HI>Messenger,</HI> the Angel <HI>of the Covenant,</HI> Mal. 3.1. because the Father sent him into the World to negotiate and establish a Peace betwixt God and Man, on the Articles of the New-Covenant. Now he whom the Prophet saw in this Vision, is stiled the Angel, and the Angel of the Lord, in the Context, and this Title belonging to Christ, may we not suppose that he was the Person here represented? Especially, if we farther observe, how those which were behind him, having walked to and fro through the Earth, render'd an Account to him, v. 11. <HI>They answered the An∣gel of the Lord that stood among the Myrtle-trees, and said, we have walked through the Earth, and behold, all the Earth sitteth still, and is at rest.</HI> These were Created Angels, (as we shall presently see) and to whom are they put in subjection, and unto whom are they accountable, but unto <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> the Lord of Angels?</P>
<P><HI>Furthermore,</HI> this Man, this Angel, whom the Prophet saw, made Intercession for the Church, V. 12. <HI>Then the Angel of the Lord answered and said, O Lord of bosts, how long wilt thou not have Mercy on Jerusalem,</HI> &amp;c. The Created Angels do not▪ <HI>ex officio,</HI> intercede with God for his People on Earth: The increated Angel of the Covenant is
<PB N="9" REF="003030_0007_0FEFAF55C38E2800"/>
the only Mediator between God and Man. The Angel who thus prayed for <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> was the same whom <HI>John</HI> saw performing this Office of a Priest, Rev. 8.3, 4. <HI>Another Angel came and stood at the Altar, having a golden Censer, and there was given unto him much Incense, that he should offer it with the Prayers of all Saints upon the golden Altar,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Thus, it is very probable, if not more than so, that he was the <HI>Man Christ Jesus</HI> who appear'd in this Vision to the Prophet.</P>
<P N="2">2. His riding upon a <HI>red Horse</HI> signified that he came as a great General, a mighty Man of War, to defend his People, and destroy his and their Enemies.</P>
<P>The God of <HI>Jesurun,</HI> who rideth upon the Heavens, for the help of his People, and in his Excellency on the Sky, was by the Prophet seen riding upon a <HI>red Horse.</HI> This glorious <HI>Captain of the Lord's host</HI> came toward <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> not on foot, but riding; which denoted his coming with speed, and Ensigns of Majesty, to relieve and defend his oppressed People. Psal. 48.3, 4. <HI>Gird thy Sword upon thy Thigh, O most Mighty▪ with thy Glory and thy Majesty; and in thy Majesty ride prosperously.</HI> He rode upon a Horse, a swift, strong, couragious Beast; which is prepared a∣gainst the day of Battle: <HI>whose Neck God hath clothed with Thunder; and the Glory of whose Nostrils is terrible; He paweth in the valley, and repriceth in his strength: He goeth on to meet the Armed Men; He mocketh a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the Sword, nor from the Quiver
<PB N="10" REF="003030_0008_0FEFAF5747C22908"/>
rattling against him, the glittering Spear and the Shield: He swalloweth the Ground with fierceness and rage, — he saith among the Trumpets,</HI> ha, ha; <HI>and he smelleth the Battle afar off, the thunder of the Cap∣tains, and the shouting</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Job. 39.</NOTE>. The Man who appear'd for the succour and defence of the Jews, was mounted on such a gallant, strong and bold Creature, to signify his Resolution, Strength and Courage to fight for his People.</P>
<P>Not only the Kind, but also the Colour of the warlike Beast on which he rode, is observable, and hath it's significancy: Behold, a Man riding upon a <HI>red</HI> Horse. The grand Enemy of the Church is set forth by this Colour, Rev. 12.3. <HI>Behold, a great red Dragon, having seven Heads, and ten Horns</HI>: i. e. The Devil with his many crafty and powerful Confederates. The redness of the Dragon imports the fierce and bloody Disposi∣tion of <HI>Satan</HI> and his Agents toward the <HI>Woman,</HI> the Church: That the Enemies of the Church are set on fire with a hellish flame of Wrath and Cruelty against it; and are often red with the blood of Martyrs. But for the Comfort of the Lord's People, their great Deliverer appeareth on a red Horse: — for,</P>
<P N="1">1. This denotes <HI>Christ's fiery Indignation</HI> against his and their Enemies. Red is the Colour of Anger: a fiery Colour. The Horse on which the mighty Defender of the Church rode, was of this Colour, to shew that he was <HI>jealous for Jeru∣salem with great jealousy,</HI> and very angry at her Enemies, and came with fiery Indignation to consume the Adversaries. He is red with An∣ger,
<PB N="11" REF="003030_0009_0FEFAF59A2D66D30"/>
and his Eyes are as a <HI>flame of fire</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. 19 11, 12.</NOTE>, when he comes in Righteousness to judge and make War.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Lord Jesus appear'd on a <HI>red</HI> Horse, to signify the <HI>perfect Conquest</HI> he wou'd atchieve over his and his People's Enemies.</P>
<P>This portended Blood and Slaughter to the Enemies of Christ, and of his Church: That the Horse on which the Saviour of God's people rideth, should be died red with the blood of their Enemies. A red Horse was in sacred Vi∣sions Symbolical of great slaughter and destructi∣on: Rev. 6.4. <HI>There went out another Horse that was red, and power was given to him that sat thereon, to take peace from the Earth, and that they should kill one another, and there was given unto him a great Sword.</HI> The Prophet <HI>Isaiah,</HI> in like manner as <HI>Zechariah</HI> did, saw Christ's martial Glory, and spake of him: He saw this same victorious War∣rior in red Apparel, and was told the reason of his appearing in such a Habit; which explains to us his riding upon a red Horse. Isa. 63. <HI>begin. Who is this that cometh from Edom, with died Gar∣ments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his Ap∣parel; travelling in the greatness of his strength</HI>? — The Prophet with Admiration saw a mighty Hero returning from the land of his Enemies, into which he had carried the War, with died Garments, and in a majestic Gate, both honou∣rable to a Soldier when he comes from a bloody Engagement. He first inquir'd, who he was: The victorious Prince answer'd the inquisitive Prophet, saying, <HI>I that speak in Righteousness, migh∣ty
<PB N="12" REF="003030_0010_0FEFAF5C296C7A18"/>
to save</HI>:— It is Jesus, the mighty Saviour— The Prophet then ask'd, <HI>Why art thou red in thine Apparel, and thy Garments like him that tread∣eth in the Wine-fat?</HI> To which Question the Conqueror gave this Answer, <HI>I have trodden the Wine press alone, and of the People there was none with me: for I will tread in mine▪ anger, and tram∣ple them in my fury, and their blood shall be sprink∣led on my Garments, and I will stain all my Raiment. For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come.</HI> He was red in his Apparel, to shew that when the day determined for the taking vengeance on his and his People's Enemies, and the time fix'd for the deliverance of the Church, should come, he would make such dreadful slaughter as a mighty Conqueror doth when he besmears all his Garments with the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of his Enemies. The same thing is represented in our Text, by Christ's appearing on a red Horse. His Horse is red for the same reason, that his Garments are. His Wrath a∣gainst his Enemies is so severe, and his victory, over them so glorious, that even the Horse on which he rides, conquering and to conquer, is died red with the blood of War. The destructi∣on of Mystical <HI>Babylon</HI> is thus express'd, Rev. 14.20. <HI>The <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> press was <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the city, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> out of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> unto the Horse-bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred fur∣longs.</HI> "The Spirit of God is so particular in describing the height of the deluge of blood, to the Bridles of the Horses, and the length of the flood, to the space of two hundred miles, that we might apprehend the severity of that Wrath which shall be executed on his Enemies".</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="003030_0011_0FEFAF5E82C78C40"/>Thus we see, who he was whom the Prophet beheld riding upon a red Horse, and what was signified thereby.— We pass to the second Inquiry:</P>
<P>Q. II. What was intended by this <HI>Man's stand∣ing among the Myrtle-trees that were in the Bottom?</HI></P>
<P>A. Christ's presence with his People in their <HI>low Condition.</HI>— The Myrtle-trees represented the People of God; were <HI>Emblems</HI> of the Saints. The Lord's People are frequently in Scripture compared unto Trees. <HI>They are called Trees of Righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isa 61.3.</NOTE> in their bringing forth of much fruit. The Saints are compared unto divers sorts of Trees. The Lord God hath planted a second <HI>Eden,</HI> the Garden of the Church, and in it he makes to grow <HI>every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for fruit.</HI> Among other trees in this Garden, there is the Myrtle-tree. Saints are re∣sembled to Myrtle-trees; Isai. 41.19. <HI>I will plant in the Wilderness the Cedar, the Shittah tree, and the Myrtle</HI>▪ God here promiseth to set up his Church in the Gentile Wilderness, and that the Myrtle should be one of the goodly trees which he would plant therein. Isa. 55.13. <HI>Instead of the Thorn shall come up the Fir-tree, and instead of the Brier shall come up the Myrtle-tree: and it shall be to the Lord for a Name, for an everlasting Sign that shall not be cut off.</HI> There is as great a Change wro't by converting Grace, as if Thorns and Briers were turned into <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irs and Myrtle trees —
<PB N="14" REF="003030_0012_0FEFAF61C2A55A58"/>
This is a promise to the Church, that it should be delivered from hurtful vexatious Men, and replenished with holy and useful Believers, and with all sorts of divine Graces and Blessings.</P>
<P>In these places of holy Scripture, the true people of God are compared unto Myrtle-trees; and why should not we think that they were signified by the Myrtle-trees in this Vision?</P>
<P>The Myrtles are valuable, verdant Trees; and so fit Emblems of the excellent, flourishing and fruitful Servants of God. The Myrtles are very beautiful Trees, the Branches thereof were used to adorn Houses withal <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Nat. Hist.</NOTE>; so they represent the Saints, who being planted in the house of the Lord, do flourish therein, and are an Orna∣ment thereto. The Myrtles are odoriferous Trees; they are not only pleasant to the sight, but also grateful to the smell; they yield a sweet and refreshing Oil. The Saints therefore are fitly compared to them, in respect of the fragrancy of their Graces and good Fruits. Saith <HI>Christ</HI> to his Spouse, the Church, <HI>How much better is the smell of thine Ointments, than all Spices? and the smell of thy Garments is like the smell of Leba∣non</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cent. 5 10, 11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Myrtle-trees which our <HI>Prophet</HI> saw, were in the Bottom, a low piece of Ground; signi∣fying the people of God in a low, afflicted Condition. The <HI>Jews</HI> being then newly come from <HI>Babylon,</HI> to resettle the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> and rebuild the House of <HI>God</HI> at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> were in low, dark, and melancholly Circumstances at
<PB N="15" REF="003030_0013_0FEFAF634A9B2DF0"/>
that time. They were surrounded with enemies, proud and strong; which like Mountains over-top'd them: Zech. 4.7. <HI>Who art thou, O great Mountain?</HI> The Nations about them hated and oppressed them; therefore Myrtle-trees in the Bottom, did aptly set forth their Condition. And this is frequently the state of God's People in this world: they are oftentimes brought low, yea, very low; are greatly depressed by their Enemies, who exalt themselves against them. But, for their comfort, the Prophet saw the Man on a red Horse, ride into the Myrtle-Grove in the Bottom, and there make a halt; representing the Lord Jesus Christ's seasonable coming to the succour of his People in their low Condition. He will then be present with them, to defend and save them. He may suffer them to be brought low, but not to be quite trodden down by their Enemies. He will remember them, and appear for them, in their low estate. Isai. 63.9. <HI>In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the Angel of his presence saved them, all the days of old.</HI> And as this Angel of God's presence, the Lord Je∣sus Christ, was all the days of old with his People in their low estate, so he will be with them all the days to come: <HI>Lo, I am with you alway, even to the end of the World. Amen.</HI> He is among the Myrtle-trees in the bottom, as in an Ambush; undiscover'd by the Enemies of the Church, and will in the fittest season arise for her defence, and to their Surprize and Confusion. Psal. 46.5, 6, 7. <HI>God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early,</HI> (or, <HI>when the Morning appeareth,</HI> as it is rendred in the Margin, i. e. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pool</HI> in loc.</NOTE> speedily, after a short Night of
<PB N="16" REF="003030_0014_0FEFAF64E49C8F00"/>
Affliction; and seasonably, when the danger is greatest, and the Enemies prepare to make the Assault, which is commonly done in the Mor∣ning.) <HI>The Heathen raged, the Kingdoms were mo∣ved: He uttered his Voice, the Earth melted. The Lord of hosts is with us, the God of Jacob is our Re∣fuge. Selah.</HI></P>
<P>Q. III. What did the <HI>red Horses, speckled, and white, behind the Man which stood among the Myrtle-trees in the bottom,</HI> represent?</P>
<P>A. <HI>Holy Angels</HI> attending on <HI>Christ,</HI> and ready to be employed by him for the defence of his People, and the destruction of their Enemies.</P>
<P>The Prophet saw a goodly Troop behind the Man riding on a red Horse: He saw a Company of Horses, with their Riders doubtless, having every one a Slaughter-weapon in his hand, mar∣shalled to Battle, under the Command of a glori∣ous Captain; whom <HI>Zechariah</HI> (as it seems) quick∣ly perceiv'd to be a divine Person, the blessed Angel of the Covenant, and therefore apply'd himself to him as his Lord, desiring to know what those were behind him. — v. 9, 10. <HI>Then said I, O my Lord, what are these? And the Angel that talked with me, said unto me, I will shew thee what these be. And the Man that stood among the Myrtle-trees answered and said, These are they whom the Lord hath sent to walk to and fro through the Earth.</HI> This Information which the Prophet receiv'd from the Mouth of the faithful and true Witness, sheweth that they were Angels, which the Horses behind the Man that stood among the Myrtle-trees represented: For <HI>are they not all ministring Spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be
<PB N="17" REF="003030_0015_0FEFAF67661A9F98"/>
Heirs of Salvation</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. 1.14.</NOTE>? The Account which is in our Context given of the Horses behind the Man standing among the Myrtle-trees, agrees with that which the Apostle gives of the holy Angels of God: They are such whom the Lord sends forth, and improves as chief Ministers of his Providence. This was not the only time that Angels appear'd in the form of Horses; See 2. King 6.17. Zech. 6.2, 3. Horses are Em∣blems of Angels, in regard of their swiftness, strength and courage. The Angels were in this Vision represented by Horses of divers Colours, <HI>red, speckled and white</HI>; signifying the various Offices to which they are deputed, and the diffe∣rent Events of Providence in which they are made use of, and perhaps alluding (as One sug∣gesteth) <Q>to the diversities of Colours in the standards of an Army, for Soldiers to know their Leaders, and keep Rank and Order.</Q>— We shall consider the Angels now only in their Martial Character, for they are here represented in a War-like Posture, formed into a strong Bat∣talion: And they are in Scripture termed an <HI>Host,</HI> and the <HI>Army of Heaven.</HI> They are good Soldiers of Jesus Christ: are under his Command: This was signified by the place in which they appear'd; <HI>Behind</HI> the Man riding on a red Horse. The Captain of our Salvation, is Captain-Gene∣ral of the heavenly Host. By Right of Creation, the Son of God is the Lord and Leader of An∣gels; <HI>for by him were all things Created that are in Heaven, and that are in Earth, visible and invisible, whether they be Thrones, or Dominions, or Principali∣ties, or Powers: all things were Created by him, and
<PB N="18" REF="003030_0016_0FEFAF6908236B78"/>
for him.</HI> And, as Mediator, Christ Jesus is the Head of Angels: for altho' the humane Nature be lower than the Angelical, yet the Son of God assuming it into personal Union with the divine, he as God-Man, is far superior to all Created Angels: And for a Reward of his deep humili∣ation, God the Father hath exalted him, as Me∣diator, to a supreme Dominion over them: <HI>An∣gels, and Authorities, and Powers, are made subject to him.</HI> Thus, the Scriptures of the <HI>New-Testament</HI> clearly reveal to us, what was in this Vision darkly represented to the Prophet, <HI>viz.</HI> That Jesus Christ hath all the Angels of Heaven under his Command: They are behind him, ready to receive and execute his Orders.</P>
<P>And he employs them,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>For the defence and salvation of his People,</HI> while they remain in this World, and when they pass into another. The holy Angels protect and deliver the Servants of Christ in this World, both from their bodily, and their spiritual Enemies. From their <HI>bodily Enemies</HI>; Psal. 34.7. <HI>The Angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.</HI> But, how can an Angel en∣camp about the Multitude who fear God? En∣camping about them imports an Host's surroun∣ding of them, to guard them from dangers on every side. — I answer, that either the Singu∣lar Number is here put for the Plural, as it is in other Texts of Scripture; or else, by the Angel of the Lord is here meant Christ Jesus, who ap∣points an Army of Created Angels to encamp about his People. They are a constant, strong and faithful Life-Guard to the Saints, who are
<PB N="19" REF="003030_0017_0FEFAF6D628FBF70"/>
way-lay'd by Enemies whithersoever they go. Psal. 91.11, 12, 13. <HI>He shall give his Angels Charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a Stone. Thou shalt tread on the Lion, and Adder: the young Lion and the Dragon shalt thou trample under feet.</HI> They shrowd them under the Wings of their kind Protection; oppose and hinder the malicious Designs, even of their bodily Foes.</P>
<P>When <HI>Esau</HI> was coming to meet <HI>Jacob,</HI> and four hundred Men with him, to destroy his Bro∣ther; <HI>Jacob went on his way, and the Angels of God met him. And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the Name of that place Ma∣hanaim</HI>: two Hosts, or Camps▪ Gen. 32.1, 2. Troops of holy Angels met him, to assure him that they would fight for him against his Brother <HI>Esau,</HI> if there should be any Occasion therefor. When the King of <HI>Syria</HI> sent a great Host, both with Horses and Chariots, against the Prophet of the Lord, <HI>Behold, the Mountain was full of Horses, and Chariots of fire round about Elisha.</HI> 2 King. 6 17. There was a Guard of mighty Angels about him. When the <HI>Apostles</HI> were fall'n into the hands of their bloody Persecutors, <HI>the Angel of the Lord by Night opened the Prison-doors, and brought them forth.</HI> Act. 5.19. All the Locks and Bars of the Prison, and the Vigilance and Strength of the Keepers of it, could not detain them, when the Angel came to bring them forth. Thus, the Angels are em∣ploy'd by Christ for the Temporal Defence and Deliverance of his People. — And they are so likewise for their Defence against Spiritual Ene∣mies. We wrestle not against Flesh and Blood, (not only, nor chiefly against humane and bodily Enemies) but against Principalities, against Pow∣ers,
<PB N="20" REF="003030_0018_0FEFAF6FC7349AC0"/>
against the Rulers of the darkness of this World, against spiritual Wickedness in high pla∣ces. And Believers are assisted in their Warfare against the many Ranks of Devils by the holy Angels. <HI>Michael</HI> and his <HI>Angels</HI> do fight against the <HI>Dragon</HI> and his <HI>Angels</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rev. 12.7.</NOTE>. The good Angels vigorously resist the evil Spirits, and prevent their accomplishing of their wicked, mischievous De∣signs. They often times secure the Servants of Christ from the Wiles, and shield them from the fiery Darts of Satan. When the <HI>Devil left Christ, behold, Angels came, and ministred unto him.</HI> Mat. 4.11. The Angels did not come to him until the Combat was over, and the Devil had quitted the Field: But they come, and minister to Be∣lievers in their Conflicts with the Powers of darkness. They came to Congratulate Christ's victory; but they come to help the Saints obtain theirs. Jesus Christ did admit the assistance of an Angel in his Agony in the Garden; at which time he was doubtless most violently assaulted by the Devil: Luk. 22.43. <HI>There appeared an Angel unto him from Heaven, strengthning him.</HI> This might be, to encourage and assure his followers, that they shou'd have Angels to strengthen them against their spiritual Enemies, whom they must resist unto blood, with Agonies striving against Sin.</P>
<P>Holy Angels are employed by Christ for the Defence of his People, not only while they con∣tinue in this World, but also when they pass in∣to the next: Not only before, but also after Death They may sometimes guard the dead

Bodies of the Saints. <HI>Michael the Arch-Angel contended with the Devil about the Body of Moses.</HI> Jude v. 9. Men have differently conjectur'd what the ground of that Contest was. <HI>One</HI> thinks, "that Satan resolv'd to do some harm to the dead Body of <HI>Moses,</HI> that Man of God; which <HI>Michael</HI> and his Retinue perceiving, watch'd over it, carefully defended it, and would not suffer the infernal Spirits to seize on it". Whether this were the Controversy betwixt <HI>Mi∣chael</HI> and the Devil about the Body of <HI>Moses,</HI> or not, I pretend not to say, for the Scriptures are silent concerning it: neither do they expresly tell us that the good Angels guard the Saints Bodies after Death: Yet it is not altogether im∣probable, that they sometimes do this kind Of∣fice for them: for <HI>precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints</HI>; so precious, as that he may give Angels charge concerning their Dust, to keep it from being attack'd and abus'd by malicious Men and Devils.— But, whether the Angels guard the dead Bodies of the Saints, or not, we know that they are the Convoys of their happy Souls to Paradise. <HI>There appeared a Chariot of Fire, and Horses of Fire,</HI> i. e. holy An∣gels, to conduct <HI>Elijah</HI> to Heaven, 2 King. 2.11. The Horses behind Christ, the blessed Angels under his command, are as really, tho' not so visibly, sent by him, to conduct the Souls of all Believers to Heaven. Luk. 16.22. <HI>It came to pass that the Beggar died, and was carried by the Angels into</HI> Abraham<HI>'s Bosom.</HI> The mighty Angels guard the Souls of Believers thro' the Territories of the Prince of the Power of the Air; protect them from malicious Spirits, who, like Birds of Prey, watch to seize upon them in their slight
<PB N="22" REF="003030_0020_0FEFAF75D1540CE8"/>
to Heaven; do secure them from the infernal <HI>Pharoah,</HI> who with an host pursues them to their Coelestial <HI>Canaan.</HI></P>
<P>Thus Jesus Christ employs the holy Angels, in a military way, for the Defence and Salva∣tion of his People.</P>
<P N="2">2. He employs them for the <HI>Destruction</HI> of his and his People's Enemies. We find in our Con∣text, that those whom the Prophet saw behind the Man that stood among the Myrtle-trees, were sent forth as Spies, to discover the Posture which the Enemies were in: and they are sent forth also, as Armies, to vanquish and destroy them. Christ brings the Forces into the Field of Battle, when he comes to make War upon the Enemies of his Kingdom: Joel 3.11. <HI>Thi∣ther cause the mighty ones to come down, O Lord.</HI> By the mighty ones here, may be intended the mighty Angels of Christ. These <HI>Morning Stars</HI> have in their Courses fought against <HI>Sisera,</HI> the Enemies of God's People. Some by the <HI>Sound of a going in the tops of the Mulberry-trees,</HI> 2 Sam. 5.24. understand the Sign of the marching of a Brigade of Angels, with the Lord in the head of them, for the discomfiture of <HI>David</HI>'s Ene∣mies. One of those mighty Warriors, the holy Angels, did in one Night lay a vast Army of brave tho' wicked Soldiers dead upon the spot; and turn the whole <HI>Assyrian</HI> Camp into an <HI>Acel∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ma.</HI> 2 Kin. 19.35. <HI>It came to pass that Night, that the Angel of the Lord went out, and smote in the Camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the Morning, behold, they were all dead Corpses.</HI> Angels are em∣ploy'd
<PB N="23" REF="003030_0021_0FEFAF7857166298"/>
more than we are aware of, in the just Wars of the Church; and are great Instruments of breaking the Power of its Enemies. And the final destruction of all the Enemles of Christ, and of his People, shall be accomplish'd by the Ministry of Angels. Jesus Christ will at the great Day be revealed from Heaven, with his mighty <HI>Angels,</HI> in flaming Fire, to take Venge∣ance on them who know not God, and obey not the Gospel.— The Son of Man shall send forth his <HI>Angels,</HI> and they shall gather out of his Kingdom all things that offend, and them which do Iniquity; and shall cast them into a Fur∣nace of Fire.— They shall bring forth all his Enemies, which would not that he should reign over them, and slay them before him.</P>
<P>Thus I have in some poor measure, open'd the Vision recorded in my Text: I come now to apply it.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let us with Admiration behold the <HI>Glory of Christ.</HI> The Prince of Peace is a Man of War; and how glorious is he in this Character! The <HI>Vision</HI> exhibits him to us in his own Glory, and in the Glory of his Angels. How glorious does he appear in his Martial Equipage, <HI>riding upon a red Horse,</HI> and having <HI>behind him, red Horses, speckled and white</HI>▪ Did any conquering Hero on Earth ever ride in such Majesty, and so prosperously? <HI>John,</HI> in a Vision, saw the <HI>eternal Word</HI> clothed with a Vesture dipt in Blood, (glo∣rious Apparel for a Warrior) <HI>and all the Armies which were in Heaven following him.</HI> We by Faith see him riding on a red Horse, stained with the blood of his Enemies, and all the Angelical Hosts
<PB N="24" REF="003030_0022_0FEFAF7AD12FCF90"/>
behind him. It was a Credit to <HI>David,</HI> his illus∣trious Type, that he had so many valiant Soldi∣ers, renowned Worthies, under his Command: They were called <HI>David's mighty Men, David's Worthies</HI>: How much more honourable is the Lord Jesus, who hath under his Command an innumerable Company of Angels, the lowest Rank of which far excells <HI>David's first Three,</HI> in warlike Accomplishments and Atchievements? If a Man were the Captain of Nobles, of Princes and Kings, would he not be admired as a <HI>great General?</HI> Consider then, how great the Man Christ Jesus is at the head of all the <HI>Train-bands</HI> of Heaven, Thrones, Dominions, Principalities, Powers, Cherubim and Seraphim following him! — Is there any Number of his Ar∣mies? — <HI>WHO IS THIS KING OF GLO∣RY? THE LORD STRONG AND MIGHTY, THE LORD MIGHTY IN BATTLE. — WHO IS THIS KING OF GLORY? THE LORD OF HOSTS, HE IS THE KING OF GLORY. SELAH.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>The Vision speaks terror</HI> to the Enemies of <HI>Christ,</HI> and of his People. To such the Lord Je∣sus appeareth very formidable, riding upon a red Horse, and having behind him red Horses, speck∣led and white. Is there any Army of Men with Banners so terrible as this, which the Vision represents? Wo to them, who sight against so victorious and invincible a Captain as Jesus Christ is, and who oppose his mighty Angels! He will sprinkle all his Raiment, and die his Horse, with the blood of his Enemies. Who would set the Briers and Thorns against him in Battle? he will go through them, and burn them
<PB N="25" REF="003030_0023_0FEFAF7C7B605140"/>
together: for he maketh his Angels Spirits, those Ministers of his a <HI>flame of fire,</HI> to consume the Adversaries. All <HI>Christ</HI>'s Enemies shall break, shall scatter and flee before him, when he shall arise against them. He shall strike thro' Kings in the Day of his Wrath, — he shall fill the places with the dead bodies: — he shall wound the heads over many Countries. — The time is hastning, when the Kings of the Earth, the great Men, the chief Captains, the mighty Men, and all that are in open hostility against Christ, shall seek to hide themselves in the Dens, and in the Rocks of the Mountains; and say to the Mountains and Rocks, fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the Throne, and from the Wrath of the Lamb: for the great Day of his Wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand? O! let not any of us be found among his Enemies. Luk. 14.31, 32. <HI>What King going to make War against another King, sitteth not down first, and Consulteth, whether he be able with ten thou∣sand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand? Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an Ambassage, and desireth Con∣ditions of Peace.</HI> Let us consult, and do so like∣wise; for we are not able with all our Strength, no, nor with all the confederate Forces of Hell, to meet him, who is coming against his Ene∣mies with twenty thousand Chariots and Horses, even Thousands of Angels.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>The Vision</HI> affords much Comfort to the People of God, <HI>even when they are in a low Con∣dition.</HI> This Vision was first granted for the Comfort and Encouragement of the poor depres∣sed <HI>Jews,</HI> that were surrounded with Enemies;
<PB N="26" REF="003030_0024_0FEFAF7EF9150598"/>
but it looks farther than unto them, and speaks Comfort to all the true <HI>Israel of God.</HI> The great red Dragon and his Angels thirst for the Blood of Saints, and with restless Rage seek to devour them: But the Captain of our Salvation <HI>rideth on a red Horse,</HI> cometh with Speed and Resoluti∣on to protect and save his People. He is Jealous for them with great Jealousy; he is red with Anger, and his Eyes do flame with Vengeance against their Enemies; whose Blood shall be sprinkled on every thing he useth in War against them. — The Righteous shall rejoyce, when they see the Vengeance, and shall wash their Feet in the Blood of the Wicked. <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> the Captain of the Lord's Host, hath innumerable Squadrons of Angels behind him, under his Com∣mand, and which he employs for the Defence and Deliverance of his People; therefore, let them not be dismayed at the Number, or Strength of their Enemies; for they that be with them are more and mightier than those which be a∣gainst them. There are Horses and Chariots of Fire round about them, for their Protection when they are brought low, and seem to be over-top'd by the Mountains of wicked Men, their haugh∣ty, strong and stubborn Enemies, which encom∣pass them; even then may they receive great Comfort from this Vision. The <HI>Lord of Hosts</HI> is with them, and <HI>the worm Jacob</HI> need not fear, for his Redeemer will help him, so that he shall thresh the Mountains, and beat them small. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isa. 41.15.</NOTE> When the <HI>Israelites</HI> slew the <HI>Syrians</HI> with a great Slaughter, the Servants of <HI>Benhadad</HI> encourag'd him to renew the Battle, saying, <HI>Their Gods are
<PB N="27" REF="003030_0025_0FEFAF81467A37E8"/>
Gods of the Hills, therefore they were stronger than we: But let us fight against them in the Plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 King 20.23.</NOTE> The <HI>Syrians</HI> foolishly imagin'd, that the People of <HI>Israel</HI> had Gods, which could not defend them, and fight for them in a low, as they could in a high Place: But the God of <HI>Israel</HI> made them to know, that he was the <HI>God of the Valleys,</HI> as well as the <HI>God of the Hills.</HI> In every Valley of Trouble, God's People have a Door of Hope, and Matter of Comfort, given them in this <HI>Vision.</HI> When they are brought low, they shall be helped and defen∣ded; for the Captain of their Salvation, the Man riding on a red Horse, <HI>standeth among the Myrtle-Trees in the Bottom.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. From what hath been said, Those of the <HI>Military Order</HI> may be exhorted and incited to the Duties of their <HI>Station.</HI> — It hath from the days of our Fathers been the laudable, religious Practice of the <HI>Honourable Company,</HI> the Chief of our <HI>Militia,</HI> who have now invited us into the <HI>House of the Lord,</HI> thus solemnly to wait upon him, that so their Military Exercises and Affairs might be <HI>Sanctified by the Word of God, and Prayer</HI>: And altho' the <HI>Subject</HI> which hath been treated on at this Time by the <HI>least of Christ's Ministers,</HI> (who could think of no other but what hath been exhausted on this <HI>Occasion)</HI> may seem not to be well chosen; yet is it pregnant of wholesome In∣struction unto <HI>Soldiers,</HI> and affords proper In∣ducements and Incentives to the Duties of their Calling. — By viewing the <HI>Angelick-Artillery,</HI> the <HI>Celestial Cavalcade,</HI> which the Vision exhibits
<PB N="28" REF="003030_0026_0FEFAF839E5C6278"/>
to us, <HI>Soldiers</HI> may learn what they they ought to do, and be excited to the faithful discharge of all that is incumbent on them, <HI>as such.</HI> — Wherefore,</P>
<P N="1">1. Let them be exhorted to list under the <HI>Ban∣ner</HI> of the <HI>glorious Captain,</HI> and so join themselves to the <HI>excellent Company,</HI> spoken of in our Text. There are two Generals with their Armies that divide the whole World; <HI>Michael and his Angels,</HI> and <HI>the Dragon and his Angels,</HI> Rev. 12.7. By <HI>Michael</HI> here is intended <HI>Jesus Christ</HI>; and his Angels are not only those who are so by Nature, but all such also as do engage in his Service, and are sent forth by him. By the <HI>Dragon</HI> is meant the <HI>Prince of Devils</HI>; and his Angels are not only Infernal Spirits, but all Men on Earth which are Confederate with them, in Warring against the Church. The Man whom the Prophet saw rid∣ing upon a red Horse, and the great red Dragon are the two mighty Commanders, under whose distinguishing <HI>Colours</HI> all do fight. They are con∣trary Captains, to the one or other of which we do belong. — Now, who will not be on the Lords side? Do we not chuse to fight under the Conduct of a Victorious General, and in the Company of Valiant Soldiers? Then let us be <HI>Christ's <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> as all his People are in the <HI>Day of his Power,</HI> the Day of his Armies <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 110.</NOTE>. The <HI>Root of Jesse,</HI> the illustrious Branch which sprang from that dry root, now <HI>stands for an Ensign of the People; to it let us seek,</HI> and be gathered <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isa. 11.10.</NOTE>. Will not Christ's Banner displayed, allure us into his Service? Shall we not all list under it?
<PB N="29" REF="003030_0027_0FEFAF860ADB4FE8"/>
<HI>Especially,</HI> let those of the <HI>Military Order</HI> suffer this Word of Exhortation, and give in their Names this Day to Christ, to be enter'd in his <HI>Muster-Roll.</HI> Do ye not chuse him, or renew your Choice of him, to be your Captain, and resolve to follow him, <HI>with the Armies that are in Heaven upon white Horses, clothed in fine Linen, white and clean</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rev. 19.14.</NOTE>? Devote your martial Skill and Strength unto him, to be employ'd only and wholly in his Service. Let <HI>Holiness to the Lord of Hosts be</HI> written upon all your Weapons of War. May the <HI>Spirit</HI> come on you now, as it did on <HI>Amasai,</HI> when he said, <HI>Thine are we,</HI> Da∣vid, <HI>and on thy side, thou Son of</HI> Jesse: <HI>Peace, Peace be unto thee, and Peace be to thine helpers, for thy God helpeth thee</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Chron. 12.18.</NOTE>: And the Son and Lord of <HI>David</HI> will receive you. Take the <HI>Military Oath</HI> unto him: solemnly oblige your selves to obey this Commander in all things to the utmost of your Power; and be ready to attend, whenever he shall order your Appearance in the Field of Bat∣tle. Say unto him, as the <HI>Israelites</HI> did unto <HI>Jo∣shua,</HI> his Type, <HI>All that thou commandest us to do, we will do; and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Josh. 1.16.</NOTE>. The glorious Angels count it their Honour to be behind the Man riding on a red Horse; and will any of you disdain to be so? Is it not a high Privilege to be joined to the in∣numerable Company of Angels?— Behold, God hath given his Son for a <HI>Leader</HI> and <HI>Com∣mander to the People</HI>; and will you not thankfully and joyfully accept and own him to be yours? How happy will you be under the Conduct of so wise a Leader, so great a Commander, as the
<PB N="30" REF="003030_0028_0FEFAF885415C4F8"/>
Lord Jesus is, and in such a valiant glorious Company, as that of the angelical Host behind him?</P>
<P N="2">2. Having listed your selves under the <HI>Banner</HI> of Christ, prepare for the <HI>Service</HI> which he may call you forth unto. You should not profess your selves his Soldiers, unless you design and resolve, that whenever there shall be Occasion therefor, and a Call thereto, you will fight un∣der his Banner. Since your Captain appears on a red Horse, you may look for bloody Engage∣ments with his and his People's Enemies, and should furnish your selves with Skill to fight the <HI>Lord's Battles.</HI> The happy Time is expected, in which Men shall beat their Swords into Plough-shares, and their Spears into Pruning-hooks: Nation shall not lift up Sword against Nation, neither shall they learn War any more <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isa. 2.4.</NOTE>. But, till that peaceful Period arrive, the <HI>Art of War</HI> is not to be laid aside as useless by a Christian People. War should be learnt, when there is no present Occasion for the Practice of it. Those of the military Order should study this Art, and be Men expert in War. Cant. 3.7, 8. <HI>Behold, his Bed, which is Solomon's, three score valiant Men are about it, of the valiant of Israel. They all hold Swords, being expert in War.</HI> The Bed of him whom <HI>Solomon</HI> typified, is the <HI>Church</HI>; Not only Magistrates and Ministers, but Soldiers also, are appointed to guard and defend it: and it is re∣quisite, that they be Men of Valor, and <HI>expert in War.</HI>— Military Skill is a good Gift, that cometh down from the <HI>Father of Lights:</HI> It is to
<PB N="31" REF="003030_0029_0FEFAF8AC9C70958"/>
be obtain'd of him by Industry, and the praise of it to be rendred unto him. Psal. 144.1. <HI>Bles∣sed be the Lord my Strength, which teacheth my Hands to War, and my Fingers to Fight.</HI></P>
<P>It is a Glory to a People, and a Defence up∣on all their Glory, to have Men skilful in War: And on the other Hand, ignorant, undisciplin'd Soldiers are always a Reproach to, and some∣times the Ruin of a People.— Is it not faul∣ty Negligence in those of the Military Order amongst us, that the most of them take so little Care to furnish themselves with proper and use∣ful Skill, and do remain so great strangers to the <HI>Art of War,</HI> and that too many who shou'd be able to teach it others, need themselves to be taught which be the first principles of it?— The reviving of the Military Spirit, which hath for many Years languished among us, should be endeavoured; <HI>Especially</HI> in the Reign of a puissant, yet peaceable <HI>King,</HI> who is renown'd for his early and exemplary acquaintance with the Art of War; which is one of his bright Accomplish∣ments to be a <HI>tutelar Angel</HI> unto his loyal People, over which God hath set him, <HI>and we pray long to continue him.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. In Obedience to your great Commander, and Conformity to the blessed Angels, <HI>willingly go forth to War,</HI> whenever ye shall be called there∣to. — We are bound to thank God, for the happy prospect which there is at this Day of con∣tinued Peace in <HI>Europe</HI>; and for his Blessing on the prudent measures of this <HI>Government,</HI> whereby Peace is established in our <HI>Borders.</HI> But we know not how soon we must hear the Alarm of War
<PB N="32" REF="003030_0030_0FEFAF8D32691338"/>
again: And if you should be called to jeopard your Lives in the high places of the Field, or Thickets of the Wilderness, remember that you are Voluntiers in the Service of the God-man riding on a red Horse, and you must follow him whithersoever he leadeth you. — Do not Cowardly stay at home, when he calls you a∣broad, but readily go forth to fight for the Cities of our God. Avoid the <HI>Curse of Meroz,</HI> the Inha∣bitants whereof, the <HI>Angel of the Lord said, Curse ye bitterly</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Judg. 5.23.</NOTE>, because they came not to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord against the mighty.</P>
<P>It is a Work, in it self consider'd, very unde∣sirable and melancholly, to destroy the Lives of your fellow-Creatures. Malice shou'd not be your Motive to it, nor the glutting of your Re∣venge make it pleasant to you. It should not be your Sport and Pastime, to kill Men whom ye ought to love, and dispatch to Eternity those who, you may fear, are unprovided for it. He that loveth his Neighbour as himself, and blesseth, and doth good to his Enemies, will take it heavi∣ly to be employ'd in killing of them, even when urgent Necessity and the evident Call of God make it his Duty. Yet, Obedience to your great Commander shou'd be always delightful to you, and the good and safety of his People be chear∣fully and vigorously pursued by you.</P>
<P>The holy Angels, to whom ye join yourselves, and with whom ye go forth in a just War, and whom ye are to imitate in doing the Will of God
<PB N="33" REF="003030_0031_0FEFAF907111A540"/>
on Earth, readily execute the Orders of their and your glorious Commander, when he sends them on the Errands of his Vengeance. Ezek. 9.5, 6, 7. <HI>To the others he said in mine hearing, go ye after him through the City, and smite: let not your Eye spare, neither have ye pity. Slay utterly old and young, both Maids, and little Children, and Women — defile the House, and fill the Courts with the Slain, go ye forth; and they went forth and slew in the City.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. If you shou'd be called into the Field of Battle, <HI>fight as it becomes those,</HI> who are under the Conduct of the <HI>Lord Jesus,</HI> and in the Company of his mighty Angels.</P>
<P>To be led into the Field by a victorious Gene∣ral, and with valiant Soldiers, may well animate the greatest Coward to fight. When Christian Soldiers go forth to War in a just Cause, they may by Faith see the <HI>Man riding on a red Horse,</HI> a glorious Captain, an invincible Hero, before them as their <HI>Leader</HI>; and behind him, the <HI>red Horses, speckled and white,</HI> the mighty Angels of God, as their <HI>Fellow-soldiers</HI>: And this may well inspire them with Courage, and make them wax valiant in fight.— Courage is a necessary Qualification of a Soldier; the greatest Skill and Strength without it, are of little use in War: The Exercise of it is difficult, when a Man looks a potent Enemy in the Face, and marcheth into the Mouth of Danger, heareth the roaring Canons and Guns, and the confused horrible Noise with which every Battle of the Warrior is attended; seeth the glittering Sword brandished, and multitudes fall on his right hand
<PB N="34" REF="003030_0032_0FEFAF92F09C1398"/>
and on his left, rouling their Garments in blood. "The heathen Moralists reckoned bravery in War, to be the highest expression of Courage, and that the Soldier had the greatest Opportu∣nity to shew Courage, because Life, the dearest thing in this World, is risqued in War." Now, Christian Soldiers have the greatest Incentive to Valour, they fighting under such a Captain, and in such a Company, as the Vision repre∣sents.</P>
<P><HI>Plutarch</HI> observes concerning <HI>Caesar</HI>'s Soldiers, that they who in Service under other Com∣manders, did not exceed the ordinary Rate of Courage, nor excel their Fellows, did yet when <HI>he</HI> led them, become irresistibly valiant, being animated and inspired by his unparallel'd Gal∣lantry.</P>
<P>Behold, a greater than <HI>Caesar</HI> leads the Chri∣stian Soldiers, and the mighty Angels are with them in a <HI>holy War</HI>; the consideration of which may render the most dastardly Spirit bold and adventurous. The exemplary Valour, and in∣vincible Force of so great a General and Host, may infuse Courage into the most timorous and faint-hearted, and make him that is feeble to be as <HI>David.</HI> 2 Chron. 32.7, 8. <HI>Be strong and coura∣gious, be not afraid, nor dismayed for the King of As∣syria, nor for all the multitude that is with him: for there be more with us than with him. With him is an Arm of flesh, but with us is the Lord our God, to help us, and to fight our Battles.</HI> The <HI>Egyptians,</HI> the Enemies of God's People, <HI>are Men, and not God; and their Horses, flesh, and not spirit</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isa. 31.3.</NOTE>: But the red

Horses, speckled and white, behind the Man, who is God as well as Man, standing among the Myrtle-trees, are spirit, and not flesh.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Take heed,</HI> that your whole <HI>Behaviour may please the Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> under whose Banner ye list, and the holy Angels also, the Coelestial Company, to which ye join yourselves. Every Man that warreth should endeavour to <HI>please him, who hath chosen him to be a Soldier</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. 2 4.</NOTE>. Hath the Captain of the Lord's host, the mighty Jesus, chosen you to be his Soldiers? be careful then to please him in all things. The <HI>Angelic Legions</HI> behind him do so; <HI>they do his Commandments, hear∣kening unto the voice of his Word</HI>: And they are exhibited as a Pattern for your Imitation. With speed and chearfulness obey every Word of Command, that ye receive from the Mouth of so glorious a Captain; and do nothing without, or contrary to his Order. Be always upon your Guard against Sin. Arm your selves against those Temptations unto it, with which Soldiers especially are assaulted, and too often over∣come.— Watch against Sin in your <HI>prepara∣tory Exercises:</HI> On Days set apart therefor, run not into excess of Riot, as the Practice of ma∣ny hath been: Serve not your Lusts, which war against your Souls, and the grand Enemy of God and Man, while you pretend to be fit∣ting your selves for the Service of Christ, your King and Country.— And if you should go forth to War, keep your selves from every evil thing: Let there be no accursed thing in the

Camp, to trouble it. Manage your whole Em∣ployment inoffensively. Luke 3.14. <HI>The Soldiers demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no Man, nei∣ther accuse any falsly, and be content with your Wa∣ges.</HI>— You are intirely dependent on Christ for Safety and Success: This <HI>Lord of Hosts</HI> is for Strength to them that turn the Battle to the Gate. It is your Wisdom therefore to take heed unto your selves, lest ye should in any Action of yours displease him.— And herein Sol∣diers must exercise themselves, that they may be void of Offence toward God and Man, and Angels also. Good Behaviour is requir'd not only in the <HI>Church,</HI> but also in the <HI>Camp, because of the Angels</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 11.10.</NOTE>. Take heed, that ye do not by any unseemly and sinful Carriage offend those holy Spirits, your fellow-servants and soldiers, and forfeit their Assistance and Protection. Let your whole deportment be such as may please your great Commander, and the heavenly Allies: Then shall your <HI>Righteousness go before you, and the Glory of the Lord shall be your Rere∣ward</HI>:</P>
<P><HI>The Lord our Righteousness</HI> shall go before you, as a <HI>Van-guard,</HI> to secure you from Enemies that may charge you in the <HI>Front</HI>; and the <HI>Glory of the Lord,</HI> his mighty Angels, shall be your <HI>Rere∣ward,</HI> a <HI>gathering Host,</HI> to secure you from Ene∣mies that, like <HI>Amalek,</HI> would fall upon your <HI>Rear.</HI>— Happy are those Soldiers who are in favour with the Man whom the <HI>Prophet</HI> be∣held

<HI>riding on a red Horse,</HI> and with the valiant Company which he saw <HI>behind him.</HI> They shall ride on the high places of the Earth, and tread on the Necks of their Enemies: Or, should their Bodies fall, and die on the <HI>Bed of Honour,</HI> yet their Spirits shall not miss of a <HI>Triumph</HI>; but gloriously ride up to the <HI>City of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem,</HI> and there be received with the Ac∣clamations of Angels, and rewarded for their Faithfulness by Jesus Christ with the <HI>Garland</HI> of Immortality, the Crown of Life which fadeth not away.</P>
<P>To Conclude;</P>
<P>Let us all engage in, and manage the spiritual Warfare, under the Conduct of the Man <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> the Captain of our Salvation, and in the Company of his blessed Angels that are behind him. Let us fight the good Fight of Faith, trusting in the Wisdom and Strength of our great Commander, who is ready to give us Legions of mighty Angels, to assist us in our Combats with infernal Principalities and Powers, and to bring us off at last <HI>more than Conquerors.</HI> —In other Battles, the Event is uncertain, and that is a good Caution, which the <HI>King of Israel</HI> gave <HI>Benhadad,</HI> 1 Kings 20.11. <HI>Let not him that girdeth on his Harness, boast himself, as he that putteth it off</HI> But, Christ assureth Believers of Victory in their spiritual Conflicts. He hath in his own Person, tho' not for his own sake, encounter'd and overcome the Enemies of our Souls, and will certainly help us to vanquish them, if we resign our selves to his Conduct, and rely on his

Power: This should not make us careless, but Couragious, in fighting against them.</P>
<P>And when we have overcome, we shall stand before the Throne, and before the Lamb, Clo∣thed with white Robes, and Palms in our Hands, and cry with a loud Voice, saying, <HI>Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb.</HI> — And all the Angels round a∣bout the Throne shall say, <HI>AMEN</HI>: Bles∣sing, and Glory, and Wisdom, and Thanks∣giving, and Honour, and Power, and Might, be unto our God for ever and ever, <HI>AMEN.</HI></P>
