<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>ON December 25, 1698, a number of young persons, actuated by a love for religion, and a desire to assist and pro∣mote each other's advancement in the offices of piety, agreed upon "a private weekly meeting, for religious exercise, and the good improvement of the even∣ing of the LORD's day."</P>
<P>ABOUT eleven years after, as the members had become numerous, and it was inconvenient to assemble in one place, it was deemed advisable to di∣vide; and one branch of the society continued to meet in the south part of the town, and the other in the north.</P>
<P>THE society is composed of serious and well disposed youths, who continue members till they form family connec∣tions, or leave the town. There is no recollection of a single instance of the expulsion of an individual for ill con∣duct,
<PB N="iv" REF="035590_0003_1005F895354FCFD8"/>
or of any one having desired to leave the society from dislike. The utmost harmony and fraternal affection have prevailed in their meetings: and the institution has been promotive of the happiest effects in encouraging and assisting youthful piety and practical godliness.</P>
<P>THAT a society constituted of persons whose dispositions and principles are apt to be mutable, and easily affected and estranged by the dissipations of ear∣ly life, should have been zealously sup∣ported <HI>through a whole century,</HI> is a cir∣cumstance which must forcibly excite our admiration. On the termination of this period, the young men of the el∣der branch of the society requested that a discourse might be delivered to them in public, to commemorate the estab∣lishment of the Institution, and to fur∣ther its views. In compliance with this request the following was written and delivered, and to gratify the society it is now published.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR YOUNG FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO commemorate the establishment of that little fraternity of which you are so hap∣py as to be members, is the design of the present address. Under the patronage of Di∣vine Providence, your society has been con∣tinued during ONE HUNDRED YEARS, with∣out intermission or neglect. Within this pe∣riod, how many institutions of this kind, in neighbouring towns, and elsewhere, have been formed and discontinued! The zeal with which they commenced soon subsided; and the cold and languid spirit of the world chilled the fervors of their piety and quenched the flame of their devotion! But the fire of love <HI>here</HI> enkindled, like the lamp of the sanctuary, has been kept alive and bright; and, as "a light shining in a dark place," has diffused its cheering influence, with in∣creasing splendor, <HI>through a whole century.</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="035590_0005_1005F89952217EA8"/>
What pleasure must it afford those who im∣proved <HI>this</HI> as the school of their religious discipline, and by it were trained for that heavenly society of which they are now mem∣bers—how must it enhance the joys of such of your pious predecessors as are now in glory,—if we may suppose them bending their regards, from the exalted spheres they fill, to these humbler scenes, to behold the progress and the multiplied benefits of this association! To find here those spiritual exer∣cises commenced and cultivated which pre∣pare for a participation in their more perfect praises and joys! And how must <HI>you,</HI> my dear young friends, be encouraged and ani∣mated in all the duties and engagements of your retirement, by these considerations.</P>
<P>TO strengthen your attachment to this soci∣ety, and to further its views, I shall now call your attention to a few remarks on that pas∣sage of scripture which you will find inserted in the vi<HI>th Chapter of the Epistle to the</HI> HEBREWS, <HI>at the</HI> 11<HI>th and</HI> 12<HI>th verses.</HI></P>
<PB REF="035590_0006_1005F89BF2188620"/>
<P>"WE DESIRE THAT EVERY ONE OF YOU DO SHEW THE SAME DILIGENCE TO THE FULL ASSURANCE OF HOPE UNTO THE END.</P>
<P>"THAT YE BE NOT SLOTHFUL, BUT FOLLOWERS OF THEM WHO THROUGH FAITH AND PATIENCE INHERIT THE PROMISES."</P>
<P>THIS epistle includes a variety of in∣teresting advice: but its general view and ultimate scope appear to be, so to establish the faith and animate the zeal of the Hebrew converts to christianity, that they might con∣tinue firm and unshaken in the holy profes∣sion which they had embraced. They lived in a dissolute age. The prejudices of their own nation, and the corruption and infidelity of the world around them, exposed them to many difficulties and dangers. Those who were faithful to GOD and the Redeemer, and steadily adhered to the cause of truth and duty, had before them only the gloomy pros∣pect of public neglect or contempt; the re∣linquishment of personal ease and safety, the forfeiture of property, or the loss of life. To allay their fears, to compose their minds to fortitude and magnanimity, and to deter them from the shame and guilt of apostacy, the strongest and most weighty arguments,
<PB N="8" REF="035590_0007_1005F89E6B0707A8"/>
the most powerful and affecting dissuasives, were necessary. And such the Apostle used, to confirm them in a resolute adherence to the truth as it was in Jesus. To encourage them to "hold fast the profession of their faith without wavering,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. x. 23.</NOTE> and to preserve them from "an evil heart of unbelief,"<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. iii. 12.</NOTE> he re∣minds them of the superior excellency of <HI>Christ</HI> the minister of the gospel dispensation, not only to Moses the founder of the Jewish economy, but even to the Angels who were employed in its promulgation.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Chap. i.</NOTE> He mentions the higher and more eminent advantages re∣sulting from the gospel; that it would pro∣duce nobler effects, that it opened brighter prospects, that it was enriched with much better promises, and that it had in reversion an inheritance of heavenly rewards. And, that he might leave no motive untried that could serve to excite their ambition and fire their zeal, he bids them contemplate the conduct and recollect the success of those who had finished their course with honor, and through faith and patience had gone to inherit the promises; urging them to be followers of their steps, that they also
<PB N="9" REF="035590_0008_1005F8A1CBF93368"/>
might arrive at the same height of glory and happiness.</P>
<P>JUSTLY are the examples of great and illustrious persons, who were remarkable for the superior strength and constancy of their virtue, held in high veneration, and proposed as patterns for the rest of mankind to copy after. Such examples both instruct and per∣suade; excite admiration, inspire resolution, and prompt to excel. They shew the practi∣cability of improvements in virtue, and offer the greatest encouragements to a holy dili∣gence in religion, by presenting us with a view of its happy issue; they persuade us to tread in the paths in which others have found the way to eternal glory; and they assure us that if we gladly and eagerly follow them the same way, we may hope hereafter to meet in the same happy society, and be joint in∣heritors of the same promises.</P>
<P>CHRISTIANS are now "heirs of the promises." In <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>patience</HI> they pass the scene of their trial. Their virtue exer∣cised and improved, and their warfare finish∣ed, they receive the reward of their faith in the salvation of their souls, and go to inherit
<PB N="10" REF="035590_0009_1005F88D82848800"/>
the proffered bliss. Then, their <HI>faith</HI> is changed into sight, and their <HI>patient endur∣ance</HI> into joyful triumph. They took the course of piety and holiness, in which I trust we are progressing. They did well. They got safe to heaven, where all of us profess a desire to go. ?Who but would follow? They have and enjoy; while we wait and hope. From their holy walk and conver∣sation while they tabernacled in the flesh, be encouraged, my brethren, to take direction how to steer your course to reach the mansions they now inhabit; there to be joined with them, not as companions in <HI>tribulation</HI> and <HI>patience,</HI> but in the delights of endless praise and joyful love. As it was, and must be still their "desire that every one of you should shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope to the end;" be persuaded not to be "slothful." Be not negligent of your duty, nor indolent in its performance. Do not sit down in sluggish ease, or careless idleness; indisposed to action, or heedless of your progress. Lose not your opportunities. "Be up and doing with all your might what your hands find to do, while it is called to day, for the night of death cometh wherein no one can work." Make it the business of your
<PB N="11" REF="035590_0010_1005F8A4611DE7C0"/>
lives to serve GOD and do his will with holy earnestness, alacrity and vigor. Loiter not on the way to heaven; but run with dili∣gence the race set before you. Let nothing retard or hinder your progress. Suffer noth∣ing to interfere with your obtaining the prize promised to the active, the faithful, and the persevering. Be animated and quickened in its pursuit by the attractive influence of <HI>their</HI> example and success, who have so run as to obtain. Possess your minds with such high ideas of the incalculable value of the prize, as not to be discouraged by any hard∣ships you may have to encounter in order for obtaining it. ?Do you meet with trials and hindrances? Recollect <HI>their</HI> patience undis∣mayed with sufferings, and <HI>their</HI> zeal rising superior to all opposition, who through much tribulation have entered the kingdom of heaven. Should these trials prove so severe that "even the youths begin to faint and to tire, let them wait upon the Lord and renew their strength;" and by his assistance they shall "run and not be weary, and walk and not faint."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isai. xl. 30, 31.</NOTE> While you have <HI>faith</HI> to direct,
<PB N="12" REF="035590_0011_1005F8A9586F5348"/>
<HI>patience</HI> to endure, and <HI>diligence</HI> to execute, you may successfully accomplish the whole work of virtue. While you order your foot∣steps according to GOD's word, and put a firm trust and reliance upon him who "giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might increaseth strength," you may be sure to finish your course with joy. His spirit will help your infirmities, sanctify your pur∣poses, assist your endeavours, and compleat all your works in you with prevailing and almighty power.</P>
<P>?Do you really wish to learn the great and important branches of duty which you owe to society, yourselves, and your GOD—do you desire to pass through life with an honorable reputation and with an approving conscience, or to close it with serene views and joyful hopes—would you indeed become wise and good?—you must diligently study and obey the will and commands of GOD, made known to us in the SACRED SCRIPTURE. Make that your counsellor and guide. It will give you the best advice, furnish you with all necessary instructions in truths of the highest importance, and safely conduct you through all the dangers of this present evil
<PB N="13" REF="035590_0012_1005F8ABD550C980"/>
world to everlasting peace and felicity.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>THE celebrated JOHN LOCKE, Esq. in a letter, written the year before his death, to one who asked this question</HI>—?"What is the shortest and surest way for a young man to attain to the true know∣ledge of the Christian religion?"—<HI>made this answer,</HI> "Let him study the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> especially the <HI>New Testament.</HI> Therein are contained the words of eternal life. It has GOD for its author; SALVATION for its end; and TRUTH, without any mixture of error, for its matter."</NOTE> Other books may be read with profit and with pleasure; but let <HI>the word of</HI> GOD ob∣tain your preference, your principal atten∣tion: for it not only comprizes knowledge absolutely requisite, but eternally beneficial. It was the high commendation of the youth∣ful Timothy that from a child he had known the holy scriptures, which are able to make wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iii. 15.</NOTE></P>
<P>THAT you have received, my young friends, and may still obtain great assistance in a holy life from the association to which you belong, is certain. Its beneficial effects in promoting youthful consideration and seriousness, and in exciting and assisting a de∣votional spirit, cannot be denied. It serves, also, to prepare its members for the exercise of family religion and prayer. The latter
<PB N="14" REF="035590_0013_1005F8AD636BDB18"/>
circumstance, though not its primary object, is undoubtedly one of its happiest tendencies.</P>
<P>YOUR advantages have been lately much increased by the use of that excellent collec∣tion of religious books, presented you by the generous bounty and pious regard of a worthy and zealous friend to religion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Doctor JAMES BAKER;</HI> whose liberality was extended to both the societies.</NOTE> Profit by his munificence, in the improvement of those means he has put into your hands to get wis∣dom; and, by the frequent and careful pe∣rusal of your little library, furnish your minds to a spiritual and divine intelligence.</P>
<P>WHILE hours spent in idleness or dissipa∣tion leave behind them a painful void, or a sharp sting; hours thus employed are always recollected with pleasure.</P>
<P>IT is with inexpressible satisfaction that I perceive a spirit of serious piety prevailing amongst you. I consider it as a token of the greatest good to yourselves, to your friends, and to the church of Christ. It will, in all probability, have a prevailing influence over you through the whole course of your life. When you have arrived at years of maturity,
<PB N="15" REF="035590_0014_1005F8AFD8695FD8"/>
you will retain the religious impressions made in your priviledged retirement, and recollect the many solemn and affecting lessons there read to you.</P>
<P>IF you now serve GOD with cheerfulness, the time will come when obedience to his laws will constitute your highest felicity. Every virtue you now possess will acquire strength and vigor, till you arrive at the measure of the stature of perfect men in Christ Jesus.</P>
<P>WHILST, with every grateful sentiment, you record the origin of this Society and re∣collect the encouragement it has met and the advantages it has effected, be persuaded still to keep it alive, and to add to its credit and its usefulness. Let not its commendable ob∣ject be lost by your neglect, or defeated by your misimprovement: but shew the same diligence with its pious founders; and exert the like studious care, with which they were impressed, to promote practical godliness, and establish in yourselves and others the full as∣surance of christian hope. !O let your hon∣orable esteem for them and respect for their memory be improved this way!—!Let them
<PB N="16" REF="035590_0015_1005F8B16945EB00"/>
be applied to this most important use—the forming you to pious habits, worthy princi∣ples, a good conversation; and the training of you up for that excellent course of life which will both insure your present and ever∣lasting happiness, and make your conduct edifying and your example inviting to all around you! And may your religious and pious zeal not only capacitate you to fill <HI>their</HI> places well who have graced this society, but prompt you to transmit the institution to your <HI>successors</HI> in all its purity and advantages; that it may diffuse the spirit of piety and re∣ligion through all succeeding generations to the end of the world.</P>
<P>I WILL not anticipate the pleasures and en∣comiums of posterity when <HI>they</HI> shall con∣template the origin and review the progres∣sive stages of this Institution. But it may pass for an assumption that the next age will look back on this, as we review the past. At that time, my brothers, your piety and zeal will be recollected and acknowledged with a gratitude and joy like that <HI>we</HI> feel for your predecessors.</P>
<P>TO conclude: GOD hath given us, my hearers, exceeding great and precious prom∣ises.
<PB N="17" REF="035590_0016_1005F8B6F975ABC8"/>
While with an eye of faith we see the promises afar off, let us eagerly desire and press after them. Among these are the pleas∣ing assurances of meeting in a happy society composed of "the general assembly and church of the first born which are written in heaven."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. xiii. 23.</NOTE></P>
<P>LET the joyful desire of being raised and united to this blessed company, the ardent so∣licitude to obtain this illustrious inheritance, animate us to the cultivation of every good disposition, and to the practice of every good work. Yes,—let us look up to the assembly of the blessed who surround the throne of GOD—to whom we are to conform, with whom we hope to be united. If there be <HI>honor,</HI> surely it must be found in such an union, and if there be <HI>praise,</HI> surely it must be that of following their steps. See, they beckon us—"come up hither." They unfold to us the golden portals of the temple on high; invite us to the mansions of blessedness; and shew us the unfading crown of glory which shall be placed on the head of every persevering and triumphant christian. Consider yourselves, my friends, as candidates for these honors. Often soar beyond the precincts of mortality,
<PB N="18" REF="035590_0017_1005F8A6E111AED8"/>
and have your conversation in heaven. Raise your thoughts a little, and survey your priv∣iledges. Contemplate the animating promises and prospects of the gospel. Dwell upon its joyous hopes. Send your warm desires to∣wards that blissful world, and that glorious society of the just made perfect. Cherish an inward, lively wish to dwell among them and share their pleasures. Be continually looking, aspiring, longing for the celestial re∣gions, till GOD by his grace shall have com∣pleatly prepared you for the promised glory.</P>
<P>"FINALLY, brethren, I commend you to GOD, and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up, and to give you an in∣heritance among all them which are sanc∣tified."</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>"Let us be like minded—walk by the same rule—and mind the same thing."</P>
<P>FROM a little book, published about the beginning of the present century, entitled "Private meetings ani∣mated and regulated," the following extracts are made, which may serve to shew the <HI>original</HI> plan and design of such institutions.</P>
<P>"THERE is yet another sort of <HI>private meetings,</HI> which ought with a more than or∣dinary zeal to be recommended and encour∣aged; namely, the YOUNG MENS' MEET∣INGS.</P>
<P>THESE duly managed, have been incom∣parable <HI>nurseries</HI> unto the <HI>churches,</HI> where the faithful pastors have been careful to animate them and regulate them. How often have we heard those that have joined unto our churches, declaring the vast influence which the <HI>young mens' meetings</HI> have had upon them, to engage them and confirm them, in the right ways of the Lord, and rescue them from the pathes of the destroyer; and blessing the glo∣rious name of GOD, that ever they were ac∣quainted with such precious opportunities! <HI>Parents,</HI> encourage your children: <HI>Masters,</HI> encourage your servants; to get as soon, and as much as they well can, into such precious opportunities. Young men are hereby preserv∣ed from very many temptations; and they
<PB N="20" REF="035590_0019_1005F8BA1B3D3888"/>
are also prepared mightily for such religious exercises as will be expected from them, when they come themselves to be householders. Never did any one minister in the world, that encouraged such meetings among his young men, see cause to repent of what he did: we are sure, the great numbers of them lately erected in the city of London, have been the crown and the joy of them that have been concerned in them. And such a minister would best preserve his reputation with the wiser winners of souls, who shall not go to dis∣hearten the <HI>young men</HI> of his flock, from seri∣ous and humble purposes in this way to for∣tify one another in the things that accompany salvation.</P>
<P>WE will only make a tender of some <HI>orders</HI>; which may be, all or most of them well ob∣served in such a society: and then, let any man living, who has the fear of GOD before his eyes, declaim, if he can, against the design of erecting <HI>young mens' meetings,</HI> for the ex∣ercises of religion.</P>
<P N="1">I. LET there be two hours in the evening set apart; and let there be two prayers made by the members of the society in their turns; between which, let a sermon be repeated; and there may be the singing of a psalm annexed.</P>
<P N="2">II. LET all the members of the society re∣solve to be charitably watchful over one
<PB N="21" REF="035590_0020_1005F8BBD3D81018"/>
another; never to divulge one anothers in∣firmities; always to inform and advise one another of every thing that may appear to call for an admonition, and to take it kindly when they are admonished.</P>
<P N="3">III. LET all who are to be admitted as members of the society, be accompanied by two or three of the rest, unto the minister of the place, that they may receive his holy counsels and charges, and that every thing may be done with his approbation; and so let their names be added unto the roll.</P>
<P N="4">IV. IF any person thus enrolled among them, fall into a scandalous iniquity, let the rebukes of the society be dispensed unto him; and let them forbid him, to come any more among them, until they bring suitable expres∣sions and evidences of repentance with them.</P>
<P N="5">V. LET the list be once in a quarter called over; and then, if it be observed, that any of the society have much absented themselves, let there be some sent unto them to inquire the reason of the absence; and if no reason be given but such as intimates an apostasy from good beginnings, let them upon obstinacy, after loving and faithful admonitions, be ob∣literated.</P>
<P N="6">VI. ONCE in three months, let there be, if need be, a collection, out of which the ne∣cessary charges of the society shall be de∣frayed,
<PB N="22" REF="035590_0021_1005F8C117F56470"/>
and the rest employed upon such pious uses, as may be agreed upon.</P>
<P N="7">VII. ONCE in two months, let the whole evening be devoted unto supplications for the conversion and salvation of the rising genera∣tion in the land; and particularly for the suc∣cess of the gospel, in that congregration, whereto the society does belong.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. LET the whole society, be exceed∣ingly careful, that their discourse while they are together, after the other services of relig∣ion are over, have nothing in it, that shall have any taint of backbiting, or vanity, or the least relation to the affairs of government, or to things which do not concern them, and do not serve the interests of holiness in their own conversation. But let their discourse be wholly on the matters of religion; and those also, not the disputable and controversal mat∣ters, but the points of practical piety. They may propose questions upon this intention, and every one in an orderly manner, take his liberty to answer them.</P>
<P N="9">IX. LET every person in the society, look upon it, as a special task incumbent on him, to look out for some other hopeful young man, and use all proper pains to engage him in the resolutions of godliness, until he also shall be joined unto the society. And when a society shall in this way be increased unto a
<PB N="23" REF="035590_0022_1005F8C2A51DB968"/>
fit number, let it swarm into more; who may hold an useful correspondence with one another.</P>
<P>AS arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so will young men constellated into such meet∣ings be unto the pastor that shall bring his vicinity to be filled with them. Happy is the pastor that has his quiver full of them; they need not be ashamed of what they do; they may say to their enemies, that which may shame them out of their inconsiderate enmity.</P>
<P>AND now, bring forth your strong reason, if you have any, O ye men of sloth, who are wiser than the men that can render a reason: What reason can be brought, against such societies? Truly, as it was of old argued, that it was a sign christianity was a good thing, because that such a man as Nero hated it; so, the character of those men, who de∣ride and explode these <HI>private meetings,</HI> is for the most part such, that even this would rather afford an argument unto serious christians, that it must be a good thing to uphold them, and a thing disagreeable to the spirit that rules in this world. In fine:</P>
<P>THE man who shall be the instrument of setting up such a society in a place, cannot comprehend, unto what a long train of good consequences, he is become instrumental.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="035590_0023_1005F8C44E3E6C60"/>AND they that shall in such a society, to∣gether carry on the duties of christianity, and the praises of a glorious CHRIST, will have upon themselves a blessed sympton, that they shall be together associated in the heavenly city, and in the praises and glories, that shall never have an end."</P>
<P>EXTRACT from a book entitled, "a help to national reformation," giving an account of the religious state of New England; printed in 1705.</P>
<P>"OUR religious societies increase and pros∣per. They meet at proper times to pray to∣gether, and repeat sermons, and forward one another in the fear of GOD. They are helpful in doing abundance of good for the advancement of religion in the neighbourhood, and to make the ministry much more profita∣ble in the weekly exercise of it."</P>
<P>AFTER speaking of the <HI>societies of heads of families,</HI> and those for <HI>reformation,</HI> the author observes that "the young men in Boston and its vicinity have formed themselves in asso∣ciations for religious exercises, signing some good rules to be observed by them there∣in, much like the orders of the societies of young men in London."<NOTE PLACE="foot">[AN account of the societies of young men in England, with rules and directions for their use, may be found in Baxter's Prac∣tical Works, Vol. IV.]</NOTE></P>
