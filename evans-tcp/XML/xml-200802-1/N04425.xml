<P>—And thy Father is a Man of War—.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HESE Words are a Branch of <HI>David</HI>'s Character, one of the most politic Princes and greatest Captains of his Day; to whose military Prowess, under GOD, was owing the growing Great∣ness of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Nation, now near the Summit of it's Perfection. The Fame of him had gone far and wide, beyond the Limits of <HI>Judea</HI>; his very Name opened to him the Way to Victory, <HI>and the Lord bro't the Fear of him upon all Nations.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Chron. xiv.17.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="005470_0008_101838593472F8B0"/>This is not the only Place in which the same Character is given him. It was part of the Recommendation which in∣troduced him at first into the Presence of <HI>Saul,</HI> and opened the Way to his Marriage with a Daughter of that King, and after∣wards to the Throne of <HI>Israel.</HI></P>
<P>That this was his established Character appears, not only from the History of his Life, but also from the Argument of <HI>Hushai,</HI> the King's Friend, in the Text and Context; and the Success of it. For to what else is it to be ascribed, but the Terror of his Name, that the Counsel which <HI>Hushai</HI> gave, so manifestly designed to further the Escape of the King, should prevail in Opposition to that of <HI>Ahitophel,</HI> the Oracle of the Age? Which, had it been pursued, must undoubtedly have issued in the utter Ruin of <HI>David,</HI> and the Establishment of his rebellious Son in his usurped Dominion? It was <HI>Ahitophel</HI>'s Opinion that the King was now to be followed with a select Body of Troops, while weary and weak handed: And that he knew well, this was the Moment of Success and Victory, and Crisis of <HI>Absolom</HI>'s Affairs, appears from the Despair into which he fell upon his Counsel's being rejected.</P>
<P>From this probable Design, <HI>Absolom</HI> and his Courtiers were diverted by the Argument of <HI>Hushai,</HI> in which he strenuously applies to their Fears; and represents the Danger of the Enter∣prize from the heroick Qualities of <HI>David</HI> and his Men. <HI>Thou knowest thy Father and his Men,</HI> saith he, <HI>that they be mighty Men; and they be chaffed in their Minds, as a Bear robbed of her Whelps in the Field:</HI> AND THY FATHER IS A MAN OF WAR, <HI>and will not lodge with the People.</HI> Here let me observe, This is not the first Time that a well laid wicked Design hath been conducted to the true Moment of Execution, and then failed thro' Cowardise, and, perhaps, the magnified Dangers represented by a guilty Conscience.</P>
<P>The Phrase of the Text is capable of the greatest Latitude▪ Yet I suppose, by what follows, <HI>Hushai</HI> had his Eye upon the <HI>political</HI> Part of it. <HI>Ahitophel</HI>'s Scheme proposed to smite the King only, and bring back all the People. And to this it is that <HI>Hushai</HI> answers, <HI>Thy Father is a Man of War and will not lodge with the People▪ Behold he is now hid in some Pit, or some other Place.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="005470_0009_1018385E0EB11008"/>From the Words taken in the largest Sense, I might enter into the <HI>military Character</HI> of an accomplished Soldier, describe the Art of War, and point out and recommend the best Manner of making it. But this I hope would be without my Province, because I am sure it is beyond my Capacity. But the <HI>gracious Character,</HI> and moral Accomplishments of a <HI>military</HI> Man, may well fall under the Consideration of a Minister of JESUS CHRIST, and a Teacher of that Gospel, in which is bro't down from Heaven, the Wisdom which is necessary for Men in every Station and Condition in Life. Considering therefore the words of my Text as spoken of a <HI>religious</HI> Hero, I shall hence take Occasion to speak to <HI>christian</HI> Soldiers of that gracious Turn of Mind, and those vertuous Accomplishments, which will crown their military Atchievements, and be their Security and Glory. This will be to consider RELIGION in a peculiar Light, and as it hath a special Relation to a particular Order of Men; a Light in which, I confess, I have not been much used to con∣sider it; a Light in which I little expected ever to be called to consider it, and least of all upon this Occasion.</P>
<P>In discoursing upon these Words, what I propose to do is,</P>
<P N="1">I. To consider more generally, <HI>true Religion,</HI> as a very use∣ful and necessary Qualification in the Character of a <HI>Soldier.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. I shall select out of the Circle of CHRISTIAN GRACES, some Vertues as the peculiar <HI>Accomplishment</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> of a Soldier.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>True Religion</HI> is a very requisite Qualification, in the Character of a <HI>Soldier.</HI> By true Religion, as it appears in the Life, I mean the Man, that, from a just Apprehension of his Obligations to his Maker and himself, and an effectual Belief of the Doctrines and Motives revealed by CHRIST in the Gospel, hath made a deliberate and most sincere Resignation of himself to GOD; and whose Heart, hereupon, is by divine Grace stedfastly resolved to pursue eternal Life, in the Pre∣sence of GOD and CHRIST, as his great End, and to make every other Consideration give Way to this. As there is nothing more reasonable, than that all our Faculties should be devoted to the Service of GOD, who gave them and claims them, and
<PB N="12" REF="005470_0010_1018385F9A71B6E0"/>
who hath, of his free unmerited Grace in Christ, been pleased to promise to reward the due Exercise &amp; Improvement of them; so it will be found, upon Examination, to add a true Lustre to all the Glories of this World, direct the Exercise of every Power to its proper End, and give it fresh Vigour in all its Opera∣tions. Every Order of Men, and the <HI>military</HI> Order in par∣ticular, may, if they consider the Matter, easily discern the great Advantage of Religion in their proper Calling. I will endeavour to illustrate this Point, as briefly as I can, in a few Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. One Advantage of Religion to the Soldier is: it <HI>rectifieth his Aims</HI> and directeth them to true and noble Ends. It enlargeth his Views beyond the Limits of this short Life, and elevates his Designs to the unspeakable and eternal Glories of the heavenly World; which otherwise would be confined to the Glories of this, and a deathless Fame, as he imagines, after himself is dead. Instead of this imaginary Immortality, he pursues a real one; and considers himself as happy in this, that GOD hath placed him in such a Condition of Life and Calling, as gives him an Opportunity to exercise the sublimest Grace, whereby he may come at last to shine in distinguishing Glory.</P>
<P>There is indeed a <HI>Love</HI> of <HI>Fame</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> in this World, which is then vertuous when it is pursued in the Paths of Reli∣gion, and in Subordination to the Glory of GOD. All Desire of Glory is not a faulty Ambition, any more than all Love of the World is the Sin of Covetousness; and God himself hath been pleased to gratify this Desire, as a Reward of a religious Care to glorify him. <HI>Them that honour me,</HI> saith he, <HI>I will honour; and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. 2.30.</NOTE> This Desire of Honour here, under a religious Regulation, as it is in generous Minds a mighty Principle of Action, is suted to the noblest Purposes, gives the World the most illustrious Examples of great and gracious Actions, and is of most efficacious In∣fluence in the Hand of Providence, in bringing about its great Designs. And the Soldier, of all Men, is supposed best to know it's Power and Influence upon the Minds and Actions of Men.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="005470_0011_1018386126FB2428"/>But it is the Character of the <HI>christian Soldier,</HI> to make every Prospect of worldly Glory give Place to his Hopes of that which is above. And if at any Time he finds himself inclined to pursue worldly Honour, by any Means inconsistent with those Hopes, he considers it as a Stratagem of his Grand Adversary the Prince of Darkness to destroy him. And with a just Indignation replies to it, as the Captain of his Salvation did before him, <HI>get thee behind me Satan.</HI></P>
<P>Now, this is one great Advantage of Religion to a Soldier; inasmuch as, by directing his Aims to the Glory of God, it alters the Nature of his Actions, is a Restraint from Wickedness and Motive to Vertue, and puts him in the Way of obtaining true Happiness and everlasting Honour. For he may be assured, that as CHRIST <HI>made himself of no Reputation, and became obedient to Death, even the Death of the Cross,</HI> and was therefore by GOD <HI>highly exalted,</HI> and had a <HI>Name given him above every Name, that at the Name of</HI> JESUS <HI>every Knee should bow</HI>; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. 2.7, 8, 9, 10.</NOTE> he also shall be glorified with him, if he imitates his great Example.</P>
<P N="2">2. True Religion makes the Soldier a <HI>Blessing to the World.</HI> For hence, every Enterprise being undertaken and conducted with a Regard to the Will of GOD, and consequently to the Laws of Equity and the good of Mankind, he will not come within Reach of the Psalmist's Imprecation, <HI>Scatter thou the People that delight in War</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal. 68.30.</NOTE>. The charitable Spirit of the Gospel, governing in his sanctified Mind, makes him value less the Glory of Conquest than the Happiness of his Fellow-Crea∣tures. He will abhor the Tho'ts of murdering them by Thou∣sands and ten Thousands to eternise his own Name; and would not invade a peaceable Neighbour, contented within his own just Limits, tho' to open the Way to universal Empire, and be renowned as <HI>Alexander,</HI> or <HI>Caesar.</HI></P>
<P>No; if he Delights in War, it is to suppress the injurious Spirit, and, if possible, destroy it out of the World. For such an End he <HI>willingly offers himself unto the Lord,</HI> devoting the Strength of his Body, the Fortitude of his Mind, his Estate and
<PB N="14" REF="005470_0012_101838636357D230"/>
Life, and all that is dear to him. Such a Soldier is a Blessing to the World, the Defence of the weak, the Security of his Country, and the Scourge of cruel and ambitious Tyrants, the great Disturbers of the Repose and Happiness of Mankind.</P>
<P N="3">3. True Religion engageth the <HI>Providence of</HI> GOD <HI>on our Side,</HI> and this is of the greatest Importance to the Soldier. For, whatever atheistical Men have imagined, there is a GOD in Heaven, who is no unconcerned Spectator of what is done on Earth; but holds the Reins of Government in his Hands, and whose Counsel shall stand against all the Devices of the Sons of Policy and War. <HI>He putteth down one and setteth up another. He maketh the Wrath of Man to praise him, and the Remainders of Wrath he restrains. It is he who giveth Victory to Kings. Thine O Lord, is the greatness, and the Power, and the Glory, and the Victory and the Majesty; and all that is in the Heavens and the Earth is thine; and there is no Restraint to the Lord to save by many, or by few.</HI></P>
<P>This is not a Doctrine peculiar to Revelation; but hath been assented to and practiced upon by the Heathen World. And even those <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lacedemonians. <HI>Plut.</HI></NOTE> Nations, that, from Ignorance of the supreme Being, and confined Views of the Nature and Perfections of the Deity, accounted it no better than Profaneness and Irreverence to their Gods, to invoke them upon Occasions of lesser Moment, could not miss this glaring Truth. There is a divine Providence governing the World, which by solemn Prayer is to be engaged on our Side in the great Concerns of War.</P>
<P>What signifies then the most refined Policy, or the greatest Expertness in military Affairs, if GOD be with our Adversaries? <HI>If the Lord be not on our Side, when Men rise up against us, they will swallow us up quick, when their Wrath is kinled against us.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal. 124, 2, 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>But the truely religious Soldier hath the greatest Encourage∣ment to hope in that Providence which extends it self to the minutest Circumstances, as well as to the most important Ac∣tions. And our Saviour hath taught him to conclude that he,
<PB N="15" REF="005470_0013_10183867301D4A90"/>
who cloaths the Lillies of the Field, who feeds the Ravens, and whose Providence is concerned in the Fall of a Sparrow, will much more concern himself for his own Children.</P>
<P N="4">4. By Religion those particular <HI>Graces</HI> or <HI>christian Vertuos</HI> are formed into the Soul, and maintained and cherished there, which are the Soldiers peculiar Glory, and of the greatest Usefulness and Necessity in his Calling. It is my Design, as I proposed, to speak to some of these more particularly presently. But here I would say more generally and briefly.</P>
<P>By Religion the Soldier learns to despise the Terrors of Death. A prospect of Usefulness in this World makes him wish to live, that he may attain to the greater Glory hereafter, in the future World: But his Apprehension of that Glory makes him wish <HI>to depart and be with Christ.</HI> By Religion then he is formed to live usefully, or to die nobly: He is fitted for his Calling in all Conditions, being equally prepared for Victory or Death; and having resigned himself to the Will of GOD, and learned in every State to be content, nothing can come amiss. If Dan∣gers arise, if the Clouds gather, and the Heavens grow black, and all the Presages of a desolating Tempest appear, his religious Mind quiets it self in GOD. He is exercised in the Use of Weapons peculiarly fitted for the <HI>evil Day</HI>; and hath Advant∣ages above others to withstand; and, <HI>having overcome all, to stand.</HI> The <HI>Breast-Plate of Righteousness,</HI> the <HI>Shield of Faith,</HI> and <HI>the Hope of Salvation</HI> are his Defence; and <HI>the Sword of the Spirit,</HI> the dread of his spiritual Adversaries, may well be so of his earthly ones. By his Prayers, the threatned Dangers are diverted, or he is carried thro' them, and sometimes mar∣vellously crowned with Success and Victory. But the worst that can happen is temporal; and this he little regards.</P>
<P>On the other hand, if he succeeds according to his Wishes or beyond them, he still maintains an equal Temper of Mind. As Adversity cannot depress him, neither can Success elate him into any indecent Misbehaviour. And this too Religion doth for him, by begetting and keeping up in his Mind a continual Sense and Expectation of everlasting Joys in the Presence of GOD; Joys too big to leave Room for the meaner ones of
<PB N="16" REF="005470_0014_1018386BE8D7FE60"/>
this short Life; and too entertaining to give way to them.</P>
<P>I proceed now,</P>
<P N="2">II. To consider some <HI>christian Graces</HI> as the peculiar <HI>Ac∣complishments</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> of a Soldier.</P>
<P N="1">1. In the Front of these stands <HI>Fortitude.</HI> Christian Forti∣tude is a Vertue built upon a stedfast and influential Belief of this practical Principle, that the Path of Duty is always to be pursued thro' the worst that can happen, and all Events to be left with GOD. It is the <HI>Firmness</HI> of a Mind not to be diver∣ted from its Purpose by Dangers or Sufferings; but which will risk every thing that is dear in proportion to the Value of a proposed End. It is therefore as distant from that <HI>Temerity,</HI> which is sometimes mistaken for it, when Men hazard their Lives from false Notions of Honour, or a kind of enthusiastick Bravery, as Reason is from Madness. The same Reason which directs a Man to plunge into the midst of Dangers when called by his Duty, teacheth him too not to expose needlessly a Life which is of the greatest Concern to every one.</P>
<P>This Vertue is the Soldiers peculiar Glory; and the want of it utterly destroys his Reputation. The World, from the highest to the lowest, seems agreed to pay it the most distinguish∣ing Regards: The Recital of brave Facts fires our Minds with a Spirit something like that by which the Hero performed them; and that History pleaseth most which is fullest of them; while the Heart sickens within at the Mention of a cowardly Action.</P>
<P>This Firmness and Intrepidity of Spirit owes much to macha∣nical Principles; and in this Light is to be considered as a spe∣cial Gift of the GOD of Nature, resulting from a peculiar Dis∣position of the humane Frame, and supported by outward Ac∣cidents in the Course of Providence, as Food and Exercise pro∣per to that End.</P>
<P>In this Light, tho' it cannot be considered as a <HI>christian Grace,</HI> it ought to be as a <HI>Gift of Nature</HI>; and is indeed a valuable Talent betrusted with the Possessor, and as such to be improved
<PB N="17" REF="005470_0015_101838725D0F3580"/>
to gracious Purposes, and to be accounted for in the great Day of Retribution.</P>
<P>It is a Qualification very useful to a Soldier; and, as I ap∣prehend, so necessary, that, without a good Degree of it, no Man ought to chuse, and devote himself to, a military Life. And for it GOD is to be praised, as well as for the Strength and Activity of our Bodies, or the rational Endowments of our Minds; and the Soldier is to maintain it by a vertuous Life, <HI>temperate in all Things</HI>; and he that, by intemperate Practices and a soft effeminate Course of Living, destroys it, is no less culpable than he that weakens his Reason with Wine.</P>
<P>But as it it a <HI>christian Grace,</HI> it is the Result of the Reasonings of our own Minds upon the Word of Truth, the great Instru∣ment of Sanctification, under the Influences of the holy Spirit. It springs from a Sense of our Obligations to GOD, from a Love to his Commands, from a Fear of his Displeasure, from the Hopes of his Rewards, and from the Baseness of being affrighted by any Consideration whatsoever from the Duty which we owe him.</P>
<P>It is this which distinguished the Fortitude of <HI>David</HI> from that of the Lion and the Bear. And being built upon religious Principles, like them is uniform and invariable. It is not merely a Flush of Spirits, appearing only in the Heat of Action; but is indeed most illustrious when those Fluids are at the lowest Ebb. A Prospect of Glory may give a Spring to the Spirits, to which the Honour of a great Day may be chiefly to be ascribed. But when in Adversity all Things conspire to depress Nature and sink the Heart, then in our Patience to possess our Souls, to put our Trust in GOD and hope against Hope, and betray no Meanness of Thought by any Action unworthy our Character, exhibits the Glory of Courage in the strongest Light. And I add, it is remarkable that some of the greatest Heroes which the World hath produced, have been formed to act with Success and Applause, in the most exalted Stations, by proceeding Suf∣ferings. This was the Case of <HI>David,</HI> the <HI>Man of War</HI> in our Text. And thus an Hero of our own, WILLIAM the third of glorious Memory, to which we owe much of the Succession
<PB N="18" REF="005470_0016_1018387475949938"/>
of the Crown in the illustrious House of <HI>Hanover,</HI> by a Series of Calamities was prepared to be the Deliverer of <HI>Europe</HI> from the grasping Designs of a neighbouring ambitious <HI>Monarch</HI>; and by his Presence of Mind, the Wisdom of his Conduct, and his persevering Constancy in a Course of ill Success, had a juster Claim to the Title of THE GREAT, than he that had it.</P>
<P>But if it be true that a State of Suffering exhibits the Grace of Fortitude in the fairest and strongest Light, we may behold it in the highest Perfection if we look into our BIBLES, upon the Life and Death of JESUS, <HI>the Captain of our Salvation</HI>; who was <HI>a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with Griefs</HI>; whose Con∣stancy was not to be shaken by a Prospect of Sufferings which Language cannot describe; but <HI>who, for the Joy that was set before him, endured the Cross and despised the Shame, and is set down at the right Hand of the Throne of GOD.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. 12.2.</NOTE> And, it is particularly to be noted, He is said to be qualified by Sufferings for the great Undertaking of leading the Sons of GOD to Glory; in Consequence of which, he was himself crowned with Glory and Honour. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. 2.10.</NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Clemency</HI> is to be considered as another <HI>christian Grace,</HI> and a very useful Qualification, and great Ornament to a Soldier. It is an humane benevolent Disposition towards all Men, in∣clining to Kindness and Favour, where there is Room to bestow them. It is the offspring of those Commands in the Gospel, <HI>Love one another, Love your Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>In some Respects it hath the Advantage of Strength or For∣titude. By these indeed Armies are beaten, Castles taken, and the Bodies of Men fettered in Chains of Subjection: But Cle∣mency seizeth the Soul, wins over the Affections to your Side, and subjects the conquered to your Service upon Principles never to be dissolved. It is the distinguishing Spirit of the Gos∣pel, and like it's divine Author conquers it's Opposers by Mira∣cles of Love; while Fortitude like <HI>Moses</HI> effects it's Designs by the Methods of Destruction.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="005470_0017_1018387615DD7D08"/>Great Conquests have been made by this Vertue: And in searching into the Histories of former Times to acquaint our selves with the Polices of War, you will find Instances of those that, even after repeated Victories, could never compleat their Conquests but by Clemency. An Hero then seems at the Top of his Wishes, when, having surmounted the greatest Difficul∣ties, he subdues his Enemy and pardons him at his Feet. He triumphs for a double Victory gotten at the same Time, over his Enemy, and over himself. And to deny himself the Pleasure of Revenge, where the Affronts received have been very great, is often the harder Task.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Fear of GOD</HI> is another Grace very ornamental and beneficial to a Soldier: Criticks, as I remember, have given us this as an Instance of the Sublime, <HI>I fear my GOD, I fear none but him.</HI> Sublimity in Sentiment, by being interwoven in the Habits of the Mind, and produced into Practice, forms the Hero. And it is as necessary that he fear GOD as that he fear none but him. And you may observe, they that have been so desti∣tute of this Principle as even to dare to aspire at being deifted themselves, have anon discovered less of the <HI>Man,</HI> and more of the <HI>Brute</HI> and the <HI>Devil,</HI> than the vilest Part of their Fellow-Creatures; whilest others under the Influence of it, and parti∣cularly our religious Warriour in the Text, have not only had the Applause of their own Time, which Flattery often gives, but the Praises of unprejudiced Posterity.</P>
<P>This Principle, <HI>David</HI> tells us, was taught him by GOD himself. <HI>The GOD of</HI> Israel <HI>said, the Rock of</HI> Israel <HI>spake to me; he that ruleth over Men must be just ruling in the Fear of GOD; And he shall be as the Light of the Morning when the Sun riseth, even a Morning without Clouds; as the tender Grass spring∣ing out of the Earth by clear Shining after the Rain.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="foot">2 Sam. 23.3.4.</NOTE> And under the Influences of it you find him in all Circumstances. If he enterpriseth a great Action, it is in the Fear of GOD; if he comes off with Victory and Honour, still it is in the Fear of GOD and his Goodness; or if he fall into Adversity, the Fear of GOD occasions Self Examination, Humiliation and Repen∣tance,
<PB N="20" REF="005470_0018_1018387AB2E44E18"/>
and opens a Door of Hope in the GOD of his Salvation.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Loyalty</HI> is a very necessary Vertue in a Soldier. Subjec∣tion to the higher Powers is an <HI>apostolick</HI> Precept, and binds the Soldier's Conscience. The same Text that bids us <HI>Fear GOD</HI> adds <HI>honour the King.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. 2.17.</NOTE> He then that rebels against his Sovereign, that unsheathes the Sword which he put into his Hands, and turns the Point against him, tho' upon the loudest Calls of PRIVATE Interest or Revenge, breaks the strongest Ties of Conscience and Christianity. And if the Degrees of moral Vertue are to be estimated by the good or Mischief they do in the World, Disloyalty in a Soldier must be accounted a Sin of the first Magnitude. This is the Root of that justly dreaded Evil, a civil War. And if the Connection between them were shewn, and the consequent Tragedies and continual Horrors described without any Exaggrevation, no Man of any Consideration but would tremble to remember he had ever entertained a disloyal Tho't in his Heart.</P>
<P>Often there is in Disloyalty such Ingratitude as is utterly in∣consistent with <HI>true Honour.</HI> The rebellious Soldier is one that hath lived upon his Sovereign's Bread and worn his Honours; and therefore, barely from the Ingratitude of his Actions, if he had lived at <HI>Athens,</HI> he would, by the Law of the Land, have been reduced to the ignominious State of a Slave; or amongst the <HI>Macedonians,</HI> punished with Death.</P>
<P>Nor let it be imagined, there is any Thing criminal in the Life and Character of <HI>David</HI> upon this Head. It is true, the injurious Treatment of his Prince, and his Design upon his Life drove him into the Wilderness for his Security. But notwith∣standing all the Wrongs he had to complain of in the dearest concerns, and the continual Danger of Death in which he lived, he never enterprized any Thing against his Crown or Life; but generously diverted the Purpose of another against the latter, choosing rather to leave the Redress of his Wrongs to that GOD, at whose Tribunal all the Kings of the Earth must appear like common Men, than to make himself a Judge and Revenger in
<PB N="21" REF="005470_0019_1018387CF7128E78"/>
his own Cause against his Sovereign. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. 26.8.</NOTE> The Part which <HI>David</HI> acted was no other than that of a Man conscious of his own Integrity, persecuted by a tyrannical Prince, and flying from the many unmerited Deaths that pursued him. — But I forget I am discoursing to New-English Soldiers, whose Affection to the House of <HI>Hanover,</HI> and Loyalty to his present Majesty are so firmly secured, that to say much upon this Head, may be tho't very needless. My Excuse, if it needs any, must be, the Sa∣tisfaction I take in speaking upon this Subject convinceth me of the Pleasure with which I should be heard, if I could do it any Justice.</P>
<P N="5">5. The <HI>Love of One's Country</HI> is another Vertue well becom∣ing a <HI>Soldier.</HI> Every Member of the Body politick hath a proper Office assigned it; and the meaner ones are not without their Usefulness. <HI>The Eye cannot say to the Head, I have no need of thee</HI>; nor again, <HI>the Hand to the Foot, I have no need of you.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 12.21.</NOTE> While the Merchant and the Husbandman supply the Soldier with foreign or domestic Provisions, for the Support and Com∣fort of his Life, he, in his Turn, secures them in their Posses∣sions, by his military Skill and Courage. <HI>The whole Body fitly joined together, is compacted by that which every Joint supplieth</HI>; and every Part, exerting its proper Influence, <HI>makes an Increase of the Body,</HI> building it self up in the mutual Love and Care of all the Members. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Eph. 4.16.</NOTE> Love is the Union of the whole Body, directing its various Powers to the same End. All the Endea∣vours of the Community to promote its own Welfare, take their Rise from the Love of one's Country, as Self-Love in every Man is the Principle of Self-Preservation.</P>
<P>It is therefore no less absurd and monstrous, for a Man to entertain a Spirit of Enmity against his Country, than to be a Self-Hater. And for a Soldier to employ his military Powers to oppress and ruin his Country, is for one Hand to cut off the other, and then destroy the whole Body.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="005470_0020_10183881834B52A0"/>The sacred Scriptures give us many noble Instances of this Passion. And the Enemy seemed to know the Power of it in vertuous Minds, when, to aggravate the Sense of Misery in the People of GOD, they required them to sing one of <HI>Zion</HI>'s Songs. <HI>How shall we sing,</HI> saith the Psalmist, <HI>the Lord's Song in a strange Land. If I forget thee, O</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>let my right Hand for∣get her Cunning. If I do not remember thee, let my Tongue cleave to the Roof of my Mouth; if I prefer not</HI> Jerusalem <HI>above my chief Joy.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. 137.5, 6.</NOTE></P>
<P>It was a Love to their Country, a mighty Affection to the happy Privileges which GOD had given them, that spirited ma∣ny of the Captivity to leave the Possessions which they had gained in foreign Lands, and return thro' very great Discou∣ragements, to the Land of their Fore-fathers Nativity; whilst many others of less Courage, or more Love to their worldly Acquisitions, contented themselves to enjoy their religious Privileges in the best Manner they could amongst the Heathen. But in none doth this Grace appear with greater Advantage, than in <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> tho' born and educated in a strange Land. The great Honour he had in the <HI>Persian</HI> Court might have prevail'd with another to have neglected the ruinous State of his Country, and the Wall of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> still broken down in many Places, and consequently exposed continually to the In∣roads and Insults of their Enemies. But the Use he made of it was to secure the Favour of the Monarch for his People, and to be sent into <HI>Judea,</HI> with a Commission to rebuild the Walls and Gates of that City. A great Example this, and what de∣serves often to be tho't upon by a religious Soldier, that he preserve in himself a Love to his Country, and an Affection to its Privileges, civil and religious. For no Men are more likely to be a Blessing to their People, by preserving and de∣fending them, or a Blast, by deserting and destroying them: In their Hand is the Sword to preserve or destroy.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Obedience to Superiours,</HI> is another Vertue very necessary for <HI>Soldiers.</HI> This is a Duty of great Importance to the Com∣munity;
<PB N="23" REF="005470_0021_101810A4089697D8"/>
and the Neglect of it is the Inlet to Anarchy and Confusion. No State, no Church can subsist long without it; and the Success of our Arms is necessarily connected with it.</P>
<P>If every private Soldier was first to be satisfied of the Wisdom of his Officer's Command before he moved, he would often be reasoning when he should be fighting; and in the mean Time Opportunities would be lost, which could no more be recalled than the Moment in which they presented themselves.</P>
<P>Neither are the greatest Dangers to be regarded, in Oppo∣sition to a Superiour's Command. When the religious Soldier first entred upon his Calling, he devoted his Life to the Service of his GOD, his King and Country. To risk it then, when commanded, is the very Thing he came out for: <HI>Duty</HI> is to be considered and not <HI>Danger.</HI> If he returns, he comes back with Honour and Satisfaction, and stands fair for Preferment: If he falls, he dies greatly, and in a Manner not undesireable; and <HI>his Memory shall be blessed.</HI> He dies in the Bed of true Honour, which is better than that of a Fever.</P>
<P>And as a most ready and strenuous Obedience is of the great∣est Importance in the Time of Action, it is also of great Ne∣cessity in the Time of Instruction. I am sorry there is any reason to complain, the little Respect, which is paid to Officers in some Country Towns in the Discharge of their Duty, is to be assigned as one Reason of the little Proficiency made by military Exercises. Whether this Fault be so general as to have been observed by those that have gone before me, I know not. But that it is common enough to justify this Remark, I make no Doubt. And I am persuaded the great Liberty of Speech which Soldiers take in the Field before their Officers, and even in the Time of Exercise, sometimes in an unmannerly good Humour, at other Times in angry Resentment, is an Evil that needs greatly to be reformed. And it becomes them to be subject, if <HI>not for Wrath,</HI> yet, <HI>for Conscience sake.</HI> And this minds me to say,</P>
<P N="7">7. Lastly, A <HI>teachable Spirit</HI> is a necessary Qualification in a Soldier. It is so in acquiring Knowledge and Skill in any Art; and no Man can expect to excell in military Skill without it.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="005470_0022_1018388A23CFB1B0"/>Instead therefore of bringing to military exercises an idle, careless, or ludicrous Spirit, they should be attended with a Desire and Design to learn the Duty of a Soldier, and become expert in the Handling of Arms. He that is convinced that this Kind of Skill is necessary to accomplish him for the Defence of his Country, ought to account the Time of military Exercises too precious to be trifled away. And I am persuaded, if Sol∣diers came to them with an Appetite to the Skill that is to be acquired by them, and a conscientious Disposition to make the best Improvement of them for that End, few as they are, they would be greatly serviceable.</P>
<P>But as few if any Arts are arrived at such Perfection as to be uncapable of receiving Improvement from the ingenious and industrious, a Genius will not content it self to learn only what hath been taught before; but will be ambitious of adorning his Art with new Additions of Knowledge, or a better manner of performing it. Soldiers, I presume, are not subject to a Spirit of Bigotry; and if any new Methods should be found out more beautiful and expeditious than what had been in use, I suppose a Fondness for old Practices would hardly prevent their being laid aside for new that are better. <HI>Uzziah</HI> King of <HI>Judah,</HI> a Prince of a warlike Genius, is mentioned with Honour in the sacred Scriptures for the great Improvements he made in the <HI>Art of War.</HI> You read, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Chron. 26.14, 15.</NOTE> <HI>He prepared for them thro' out all the Host Shields, and Spears, and Helmets, and Habergeons, and Bows, and Slings to cast Stones. And he made in Jerusalem Engines in∣vented by cunning Men to be upon the Towers and upon the Bulwarks to shoot Arrows and great Stones withal: And his Name spread far abroad, for he was marvelously helped till he was strong.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am very sensible several other Vertues, have an equal claim to be considered as the Soldiers peculiar Accom∣plishment and Glory; but the Desire I had, not to exceed the expected Limits of these Discourses, caused me to omit them.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="005470_0023_1018388D19590F38"/>To sum up all, this is the religious Turn of Mind, and such as these the <HI>Christian Graces</HI> which are the Accomplishment and Glory of a Soldier. Indeed they are so of Men of every Con∣dition, and in every Relation which they sustain. They shine equally in the Cabinet as the Camp, they are the Glory of the State and of the Church, of a Community and every Member of it. It is the <HI>Righteousness</HI> which <HI>exalteth a Nation,</HI> and it's Opposite the <HI>Sin which is the Reproach of any People.</HI> The an∣cient <HI>Spartans</HI> were so sensible of the Power of these Vertues, that they tho't Walls and Fortifications unnecessary for the Security of a valiant People.
<Q>Cities should not be walled with Stone and Timber, but with the Courage of the Inha∣bitants,</Q>
said one of their <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Agesilaus.</HI> Plut.</NOTE> Kings to him that asked, why <HI>Sparta</HI> was without Walls.</P>
<P>By these, they seemed to think, the Valour of their Citizens would be diminished. I dont design to recommend this <HI>Lacede∣monian</HI> Policy to my Country-men: I only observe, the unavoid∣able Deficiencies of these are best supplied with that <HI>christian Grace,</HI> which is of infinitely superiour Force to any <HI>moral Vertue</HI> in the Heathen World.</P>
<P>And, what is greatly to be regarded, it is to such Persons, to such Armies, and to such a State and People, that the encour∣aging Promises of the Protection and Presence of GOD are made in his Word. Agreably you read in the Prophet, <HI>He that walketh righteously and speaketh uprightly, he that despiseth the Gain of the Oppressor, that shaketh his Hands from holding of Bribes, that stoppeth his Ears from hearing of Blood, and shutteth his Eyes from seeing Evil: He shall dwell on high: His Place shall be the Muni∣tions of Rocks, Bread shall be given him, his Waters shall be sure.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Isa. 33.15, 16.</NOTE></P>
<P>Let me now inforce what I have been saying to Men of the MILITARY ORDER, and then I shall conclude.</P>
<P>There are two Things which it hath been my Design to re∣commend in this Discourse. One is, a religious Dedication of
<PB N="26" REF="005470_0024_1018388EED8605B0"/>
our selves to GOD, made with the utmost Seriousness and Sin∣cerity, arising from a real and influential Conviction of the Truths of the Gospel, made in our Minds by the Word and Spirit of GOD. And the other is, the Consideration and Im∣provement of those <HI>Christian Graces,</HI> which will be the peculiar Ornament of a <HI>Christian Soldier.</HI></P>
<P>The first is certainly of the greatest Consequence to the Man, whose Calling it is to hazard his Life for his King and Country. If to die well be of infinitely the greatest Concern to every Man, it especially becomes those to be prepared for Death, whose Business in Life lies upon the very Margin of the Grave. The Uncertainty of Death, how little soever it is heeded, is an un∣answerable Argument with every one to a speedy Repentance; but it strengthens with every Man in Proportion to the peculiar Hazard his Life is incident to.</P>
<P>It is not, my Brethren, a <HI>Profession of Christianity</HI> by Bap∣tism, or any other Ordinance; it is not a mere <HI>Form of Godli∣ness,</HI> and a <HI>Name to live,</HI> while in Heart and Life we are dead to the Belief and Practice of the Gospel, which I am now re∣commending: But an Apprehension of the Importance of spi∣ritual and everlasting Things, and an Heart formed to all the vertuous Purposes of the <HI>christian Life,</HI> with a just Abhor∣rence of all Sin, and an answerably vertuous and heavenly Life and Conversation.</P>
<P>This only can make Death safe, and justify any Man in devoting himself to a Life of Dangers. By this, that <HI>Fortitude of Spirit,</HI> which is a <HI>christian Vertue,</HI> is distinguished from the <HI>Rashness</HI> of him, that, tho'tless of the future, rusheth like the Horse into the Battle. And without this, <HI>Christianity,</HI> the ge∣nuine Parent of true Courage, would only serve to beget in Men, Terrors that would utterly unfit them for Action. For, I make no Doubt, the Gospel of Christ, believ'd, but not obey'd, would dishearten the Soldier in the Day of Battle, (if he had any just Apprehension of his guilty Condition) and give the heathen Stranger to the Doctrines of everlasting Misery in the future World, a great Advantage over him. And finally, by this the Favour of GOD is secured, who <HI>covereth the Head in
<PB N="27" REF="005470_0025_101838909D3C0240"/>
the Day of Battle,</HI> and crowneth the Soldier with Success and Victory.</P>
<P>Such Considerations as these, were they duly entertained, would have a peculiar Influence upon every Man that sustains a military Character.</P>
<P>But besides this, you have heard, it is incumbent upon the religious Soldier, to maintain and cherish in himself, the par∣ticular Graces of the christian Life, as the peculiar Accom∣plishment and Ornament of a military Man. Every Soldier, examining himself, should make an Estimate, in part, of his Qualifications for a military Life, by the Strength of such gra∣cious Habits within him, and the Constancy and Uniformity of their Operations in his Life. And in accomplishing himself for his Calling, while, with much Pains and Diligence in <HI>mili∣tary Exercises,</HI> he perfects himself in the <HI>Art of War,</HI> let him by no Means forget to improve himself by <HI>moral ones,</HI> so very necessary to finish his Character as a Soldier. This Kind of military Vertue is gained, maintained, and improved by <HI>Exer∣cise</HI> as well as the other.</P>
<P>By frequent Meditation therefore upon the Nature and Tendency of the several Graces of <HI>Christianity,</HI> let him acquaint himself with the Excellency of that, the <HI>Merchandise of which is better than the Merchandise of Silver, and the Gain thereof than fine Gold; which is more precious than Rubies, and not to be equalled by all the Things that thou can'st desire.</HI> By Prayer let him engage the sanctifying Influences of the holy Spirit, pro∣mised to them that ask him of GOD their heavenly Father; and by continual Practice and Watchfulness, let every Call of Corruption be constantly denied, and every gracious Disposi∣tion exerted, in common Life, as there shall be Occasion. Let him remember, <HI>He that is slow to Anger is better than the Mighty, and he that ruleth his Spirit, than he that taketh a City.</HI> Thus, by the daily Repetition of gracious Actions, let him strengthen the Habits of them within himself, and improve in the holy Art of living to GOD; that his Heart being established in Grace, he may know the Usefulness of it in his military Calling.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="005470_0026_10183895D16260E0"/>But it is now Time to come to a Conclusion, and I shall do it with an Address to the <HI>Gentlemen</HI> that have called me to the Service this Day.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>I consider the ancient and honourable Artillery-Company, as a School of military Instruction, diffusing its Influences into the most distant Parts of the Province. By your Exercises it is, that some of our most accomplish'd Soldiers have acquired their excelling Skill in these Matters, whereby they have been able to instruct others. The Usefulness of your Exercises, and military Accomplishments, is not confined within yourselves, but is very extensive.</P>
<P>This Consideration, therefore, ought to fix your Aims, and quicken your Endeavours after the highest Degrees of Perfection in military Vertue. The Prospect of Useful∣ness is your Argument, and the more Good you have it in your Power to do, the stronger it is. This is your End, whether you read in the Study, or practice in the Field; whether you search into the Reasons of ancient Customs, or the Practice of the present Day; whether you record, from the Histories of former Times for future Use, the Stratagems of War, the Policy of which pleaseth you best; or the heroic Sentiments of some great Captain that strike you most, or any divine Reflections of singular Influence upon your military Life. Your End in all these Things is the Glory of GOD, and the Service of your King and Country. What Care and Pains then become you to ex∣cell in every illustrious Accomplishment of the Soldier, that by the Force of your Instructions and reputable Exam∣ample, others may learn of you the sublimer as well as the more common ones?</P>
<P>If there be any Time, which, more than other, re∣quires the Accomplishment of a Soldier, in Perfection, it is now. GOD, who hath been lifting up an Ensign to the Nations, and as a just Punishment to an ungodly World, suffered the Lusts of Men to break forth into Wars and
<PB N="29" REF="005470_0027_10183897B2A04808"/>
Fightings, hath, the other Day, caused the Alarm of War to be sounded in our Ears also. On one Side, we are in Fears from the Invasions of exasperated Powers from afar; and on the other, from the Sword of the Wilderness in the Hands of bloody Men, <HI>whose tender Mercies are Cruelties.</HI> We have heard with our Ears, and our Fathers have told us, what bloody Tragedies have been acted upon the Stage of <HI>New-England</HI> in their Day; such as, in the Relation, might seem rather the Work of Fancy than of a faithful Historian. And to render our Prospects the more dismal, what Grounds have we to fear our Wickedness hath made us ripe for the Judgments of an incensed GOD, and to have the same things acted over again?</P>
<P>It is now no Time for Soldiers to content themselves with showy Exercises and splendid Appearances, which like the Lilly, bloom and wither in a Day. The Defence of your Country calls you into the Field, not of Exercise, but of Battle. You are to handle your Arms in good earnest, and <HI>not as one that beats the Air</HI>: You are not now to fence for Exercise or Osten∣tation, but to defend your selves; and what is more your Coun∣try, and drive away the Enemy from the Gates.</P>
<P>It is high Time therefore that, being the Subjects of Grace and Sanctification, you live in the daily Exercise of every <HI>Christ∣ian Vertue</HI>; and by such a Life, accompanied with a careful Self Examination, you had made your <HI>Calling and Election sure</HI>; and were able to think with Calmness and Indifference upon that which is so much the dread of all Men, and <HI>thro' Fear</HI> of which so many are <HI>all their Life Time subject to Bondage.</HI> Sin unrepented of, and unforsaken, is a Thing most destructive to true Valour, and will be the worst Enemy in the Day of Battle. And he that is under the Influence of it may well dread Death; and is prepared to run away to his everlastidg Infamy, which would be worse than Death, were it not for what is to follow. <HI>The Wicked flee when no Man pursueth, but the Righteous are bold as a Lion.</HI></P>
<P>But on the other Hand, having secured the Salvation of your Souls, thro' the Merits of the REDEEMER, you may not only
<PB N="30" REF="005470_0028_1018389A02A56DE0"/>
be fearless and undaunted at all the hideous Forms that Death can wear, but even wish to die in the Defence of your Country, the greatest Honour any Man can aspire to next to, that of dying for the Honour of CHRIST, who first died for him; and, what is infinitely more, may be calm as your own Consciences in that universal Ruin, when <HI>the Heavens shall be on Fire, and the Ele∣ments shall melt with fervent Heat, and the World and the Works of it shall be burnt up.</HI> I will conclude all, addressing the follow∣ing Words of the same <HI>Apostle</HI> to this whole Assembly. 2 Pet. 3.11. <HI>Seeing then that all these Things shall be dissolved, what manner of Persons ought ye to be in all holy Conversation and God∣liness?</HI></P>
