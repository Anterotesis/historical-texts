<BIBL>PSALM CXXXVII: 5. 6.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning: If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth: If I prefer not Jeru∣salem above my chief joy.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>REFLECTION upon past enjoyments tends only to the aggravation of present sufferings; and yet, I know not how, the mind of man is ever fondly disposed to draw the painful parallel betwixt the happiness which he once possessed and the misery which he now feels. This was the case of the captive Israelites, as is pathetically described in the psalm be∣fore us: <Q>By the rivers of Babylon, says the divine poet, there we sat down, yea, we wept when we re∣membered Zion: we hanged our harps upon the willows which grew in the midst thereof.</Q> As the soul in affliction is ever apt to dwell upon every circumstance which heightens the sorrow, he here represents his harp, that sacred instrument devoted to his GOD, now laid aside, silent and neglected; for how indeed could he "sing the LORD'S song in
<PB REF="015368_0005_0F98D2FDC5181F78"/>
a strange land?" Oppression and servitude throw a damp upon every noble faculty; no wonder then the sacred musician could ill exert the heavenly har∣mony under the dispiriting pressure of a foreign ty∣ranny. How shall we sing the LORD'S song in a strange land? Here the faithful patriot turns, by a very natural transition, from lamenting over his country's fate, to the strongest professions of pre∣serving his affection forever inviolable towards her, <Q>If I forget thee, O Jerusalem! let my right hand forget her cunning: If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth: If I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.</Q></P>
<P>UNDER the incitement of so animating an example, I shall offer a few sentiments concerning that virtue which produced this glorious resolution; and, after endeavouring to explain the nature and obligation of love to our country, shall attempt to point out that conduct which seems requisite to testify the sincerity of this affection.</P>
<P>THE love of our country is a principle which hath been more celebrated in all ages, hath been the subject of more praise and panegyric, than any other affection in the whole train of virtue. It hath been the constant theme of poets, orators and histo∣rians; statues and medals have been erected and struck, and all the treasures of art and wit perpetu∣ally exhausted, in doing honour to those who have
<PB REF="015368_0006_0F98D2FE8620EC88"/>
excelled in this character: And indeed the name of Patriot implies, in its true sense, every thing that is most great and godlike among men; it carries in it the idea of a public blessing; it implies a power of doing good, exerted and extended to whole com∣munities; and resembles, within its sphere, that universal providence which protects and supports the world. This is that elevated passion, of all others the most necessary, as well as most becoming, to mankind; and yet, if we believe the common com∣plaints, of all others the least visible in the world. It lives, we are told, rather in description than reality, and is represented by the first writer of this age as an antiquated and forgotten virtue. Wretched picture of the human race! If this be a just repre∣sentation, we are degenerate indeed! insensible to the best of all social duties, counteracting the com∣mon bond of alliance with our species, and check∣ing the source of our most refined pleasures. The public is, as it were, one great family; we are all children of one common mother, <HI>America,</HI> our country; she gives us all our birth, nursed our ten∣der years, and supports our manhood. In this light, therefore, our regards for her seem as natural as the implanted affection betwixt parents and children.</P>
<P>I might here enlarge on the mutual delights given and received in the social entertainments and conversation of a people connected together with
<PB REF="015368_0007_0F98D2FF451AD6C8"/>
the same language, customs and institutions, and from thence shew the reasonableness of an af∣fectionate attachment to the community, but I chuse to point out the obligations to this associating virtue as they arise from higher and more interest∣ing principles.</P>
<P>THE miseries of the state of nature are so evident that there is no occasion to display them; every man is sensible that violence, rapine and slaughter must be continually practised where no restraints are provided to curb the inordinancy of self-affection. To society then we must owe our security from these miseries, and to a wisely constructed and well regulated government we must stand indebted for our protection against those, who would encroach upon the equal share of liberty which belongs to all, or would molest individuals in the possession of what is fairly appropriated, or justly claimed. And what an unspeakable satisfaction is it to be free, and to be able to call any thing one's own! Free∣dom and security diffuse a cheerfulness over the most uncomfortable regions, and give a value to the most inconsiderable possessions; even a morsel of bread in the most frozen climate would be more worth contending for, if liberty crowned the meal, than the noblest possessions and greatest affluence under the mildest skies, if held at the merciless will of a civil or religious tyrant. And as such a happi∣ness is only to be established by the love of society;
<PB N="9" REF="015368_0008_0F98D30004673E38"/>
as all the blessings we enjoy spring from this source; gratitude calls upon us to cultivate a principle to which we owe such transcendent obligations. But the obligation rises upon us, when we consider, that from society is also derived a set of amiable duties, unknown to men in a detached and uncon∣nected state. It is from this foundation that hospita∣lity, gratitude and generosity flow, with all the pleasing charities which adorn human nature; for, where have those virtues their theatre? where is their scene of action? or how can they exert themselves, but in society? It is there alone we have opportunities of displaying the moral charms, and of exhibiting the glorious manifestation of good-will to mankind. On this account, therefore, society has a high demand for our affectionate regard.</P>
<P>BUT to be unmindful of the public, is not only an argument of an <HI>ungrateful,</HI> it is a proof also of a <HI>dishonest</HI> temper of mind. GOD has assigned each of us our station, and a part which we are obliged to discharge in carrying on the great work of social happiness. If then I neglect the part appointed me, I am highly unjust; because I take a share of the benefits of society, and yet leave the burden to be borne by others. A greater injustice than this can scarcely be conceived. He who injures parti∣culars, is indeed an offender; but he who with∣holds from the public the service and affection to
<PB REF="015368_0009_0F98D300C4675990"/>
which it is intitled, is a criminal of a far higher de∣gree, as he thereby robs a whole body of people, and deprives the community of her just demand. If GOD has given to one man a good understanding, and he does not exert it for the general advantage by advice and counsel; if to another riches, and he will not assist with his liberality; if to a poor man strength, and he will not aid with his labour; if, in short, any be wanting in pursuing the benevolent principle, by directing his talents to their proper ends, he deserves to be treated as a common spoiler, inasmuch as he takes what properly belongs not to him, the title of each man's share of the benefits of society arising only from that proportion which he himself has contributed.</P>
<P>PUBLIC good is, as it were, a common bank, in which every individual has his respective share; and consequently whatever damage that sustains, the individuals unavoidably partake of the calamity. If liberty be destroyed, no particular member can escape the chains; if the credit of the associated body sink, his fortune sinks with it; if the sons of violence prevail, and plunder the public stock, his part cannot be rescued from the spoil; and some real share (be it more or less) all, even the meanest, have in this common fund, and a valuable one too, though it were nothing but the lowest earnings of industrious labour. If, then, we have a true af∣fection for ourselves; if we would reap the fruits of
<PB N="11" REF="015368_0010_0F98D30185E9AC00"/>
industry, and enjoy our property in security, we must stand firm to the cause of liberty and public virtue, otherwise we had better return to the raw herbage for our food; to the inclemencies of the open sky for our covering; go back beyond the mountains to uncultivated nature, where our wants would be fewer, and our appetites less. Such a situation, notwithstanding all its inconveniences, is far preferable to a tyrannical government, and far more desirable than the lot of slaves.</P>
<P>WE see then how closely the kind Creator has connected our interest with our duty, and made it each man's happiness to contribute to the welfare of his country.</P>
<P>BUT still the more noble motive to a generous soul is that which springs from a benevolent desire of diffusing the joys of life to all around him. There is nothing he thinks so desirable as to be the instru∣ment of doing good; and the further it is extend∣ed, the greater is the delight, and the more glorious his character. Benignity to friends and relations is but a narrow-spirited quality compared with this, and perhaps as frequently the effect of caprice or pride as of a benevolent temper. But when our flow of good-will spreads itself to all the society, and in them to distant posterity; when charity rises into public spirit, and partial affection is extended into general benevolence, then it is that man shines in
<PB REF="015368_0011_0F98D303BAB7FF68"/>
the highest lustre, and is the truest image of his Divine Maker.</P>
<P>BUT notwithstanding all that has been said in fa∣vour of this affection, laudable as it is, we are not, however, to forget, that it may be so conducted as to become a very criminal passion. If any associa∣ted body, apprehending themselves superior to other states, should, for that reason only, invade their rights, this would be to undermine the very foundation of society, and consequently an unjusti∣fiable enterprize. Does true patriotism inspire such a conduct? Does the love of our country teach us to aggrandize it at the ruin of another? Un∣doubtedly not. And if we think at all, we must allow such attempts utterly repugnant to the fun∣damental laws of justice and universal charity. Hard would be his fate who should be commanded to perform such a service, and glorious the triumph of his soul if he resolved to decline it! In vain would he call in the example of ancient Rome for his encou∣ragement; for, after all the extravagant encomiums bestowed upon her patriotism, we shall scarce be able to clear it from the imputation of flagrant tyranny. Rome, early possessed with the high fa∣naticism of distinction and empire, declared war against mankind, and out of a feverish fondness for dominion and renown, laid desolate all the known world. Their possessions, their habitations, their paintings, their sculptures, all their riches
<PB REF="015368_0012_0F98D303CBA47FD0"/>
were the spoils of injured nations. Thus they erected to themselves an empire as unweildy as it was unjust, on the ruins of their fellow-creatures. What then are all their beautiful lectures and pompous declamations on the love of their country? What their laboured orations in praise of liberty? Indisputable proofs, indeed, of their eloquence, but not so of their humanity. If the language of benevolence were to constitute the patriotic cha∣racter, you must allow it due to these Romans; but if actions are to ascertain the right, we shall find it a difficult task to make good their claim, though we were masters even of their own eloquence.</P>
<P>Look into their city, and behold the inhabitants; there you will find this celebrated freedom spread∣ing itself only amongst particular branches, and giving a few the license to tyrannise over an infinite number of miserable slaves, rendered more wretched by having always before their eyes a disagreeable subject of comparison. Look into their provinces, (which they ought in duty to have protected) and you behold scenes of the utmost injustice, barbarity and horror. Their tyrants, not content with what might with some degree of propriety be called law∣ful taxation, but murdering them in cold blood without mercy. Now and then, it is true, you see the conquered enjoying a little ease under a humane, honest governor; but in general their oppressions were intolerable, and their whole
<PB REF="015368_0013_0F98D30484DA4F40"/>
administration no better than a course of hostility and plunder.</P>
<P>LET us change the scene, and take a cursory view of our own case. Thanks and praise be given to the LORD GOD of armies, it is our felicity not to be members of such a society! not to be in so abject and humiliating a state as those Roman colonies were! We have never yet been conquered; we never yet tamely received laws from a tyrant, nor never will, while the cause of religion, the cause of nature and of nature's GOD cry aloud, or even whisper <HI>resistance</HI> to an oppressor's execrated power. The gloomy cloud that has long been gathering and hovering over our Jerusalem, is indeed still formidable, and demands our utmost efforts to ef∣fectuate its dispersion; and this great and wished for good is in all human probability the most likely to be accomplished by firmness, unanimity, perseverance and a fixed determination strenu∣ously to execute and defend what our Continental Congress, Provincial Assemblies, Commanding Of∣ficers, and so forth, shall wisely and prudently resolve.</P>
<LG>
<L><HI>Let fools for modes of</HI> government <HI>contest,</HI></L>
<L><HI>That which is best administer'd is best.</HI></L>
</LG>
<P>AND here I will observe, that it was not through licentious opposition, or for conquest, we drew the
<PB REF="015368_0014_0F98D305447860F0"/>
sword, but for justice; not to introduce, but to prevent slavery; not upon a vain principle of am∣bition to gratify the resentment or pride of any in∣dividuals, (as many of our internal enemies have stupidly and falsely asserted) but in defence of the plainest rights, and such as all mankind have ever claimed at the call of a provoked and long injured people, and that after every other method of redress had been tried in vain.</P>
<P>THE liberty we contend for is not the license of a few to tyrannise over multitudes; but an equal freedom to all, so far as is consistent with the pre∣sent circumstances of our country, good order, the constitution, and peace of government. These are circumstances which give a sanction to patriotism, and not only justify, but demand our most active resolutions to promote the welfare of our country, by all those methods which become a civilized and numerous people, born with an instinctive love of liberty.</P>
<P>IF we bear a true and cordial affection for our country, we shall be warm and active in her cause; a calm concern is inconsistent with true patriotism, which gives ardor to the coldest breast, and makes even cowards brave.</P>
<P>THERE never was a country had stronger motives
<PB REF="015368_0015_0F98D30604A95C00"/>
to unite in active zeal than this, nor was there ever a time required it more than the present. By how much the more the enjoyment of liberty hath been asserted, improved and established amongst us; so much the greater ought to be our resolution to maintain it, and the more scandalous is our folly if we lose it. Liberty with danger is better than slavery with security.</P>
<P>OF all the known parts of the world, and for many ages, Britain hath been the most extolled for the love and protection of liberty; there the heavenly goddess seemed to have fixed her temple; and whilst her sacred fires have been extinguished in so many other countries, there they have till lately been religiously kept alive; there she hath had her saints and confessors, and a whole army of martyrs: But, alas! how are the mighty fallen! The gates of hell hath prevailed against her.</P>
<P>IF then liberty be that delicious and wholesome fruit on which the British nation hath fed for ages, and to which they owe their riches, their strength, and all the advantages they boast of, surely it is highly incumbent upon us to cherish and cultivate the tree which bears that delicious fruit, and will continue to bear it as long as we are careful to fence it in and trench it round against the beasts of the field and insects of the earth. It is then our duty to be ever vigorous and ardent in the support of
<PB REF="015368_0016_0F98D306C762EA38"/>
such a cause; to reverence the majesty of liberty, and conform our conduct to it; to cause all other inclinations to bow to this; to make it, in short, the constant object of our warmest wishes, closest attention and highest admiration <Q>to prefer Jeru∣salem above our chief joy.</Q></P>
<P>WE shall give a further proof of our patriotism, if, out of a sense of the obligations we lie under to those on whom the execution or management of our glorious cause is delegated, we endeavour to strengthen their hands, oil the wheels of patriotic power, and smooth the rugged paths of their ad∣ministration. Whilst they discharge their important duties with ability and honour, they have a just demand to the returns of grateful acknowledge∣ments, and are entitled to the warmest applauses of that people whom they have faithfully served. And as it is incumbent upon us to pay this tribute, so it is natural for them to expect it. Glory is the re∣ward of honourable toils, and public fame is the just retribution for public service; the love of which is so connected with virtue, that it seems scarcely possible to be possessed of the latter with∣out some degree of the former. Nor is this any sort of derogation to the benevolence of the character: A good man feels a pleasure from the reputation he acquires by serving his country, because he loves it; but he does not love it merely for the sake of that pleasure; the passion did not spring from the
<PB N="18" REF="015368_0017_0F98D307847F7D40"/>
expectation of the delight, but the delight was the consequence of the passion.</P>
<P>BUT after all these duties are discharged, we must not stop here, something more is still required at our hands to give the finishing testimony: If the love of your country is indeed the governing prin∣ciple of your soul, you will give up every inclina∣tion which is incompatible with it; nor will you cherish in your breasts any rivals of the favorite passion. All the train of darling vices must there∣fore be brought forth, and offered up as victims on the altars of liberty. You cannot be said to "pre∣fer Jerusalem above your chief joy," whilst you foster any appetites which have a manifest tendency to her detriment. But what is so pernicious to the common weal as vice? and what vice so much as luxury? It is this which enfeebles the body, cor∣rupts the mind, impoverishes the fortune, and in∣troduces every baneful cause of ruin. This it was which destroyed imperial Rome, and assisted Caesar to enslave her citizens. She had strength enough left her to withstand the attacks of her enemies; but those who seemed to wish her prosperity had not virtue enough to give up their luxury to her interest. Rome, therefore, fell a sacrifice to the vices of her friends. Effects always correspond to their causes: If we pursue the same course, we must expect the same fate.</P>
<P><PB REF="015368_0018_0F98D308444D6CD8"/>
THIS consideration is surely sufficient to rouse our virtue, and make us abandon all intemperate pursuits. But if out of a luxurious vanity we con∣sume the manufactures of other countries, to the detriment of our own; if our profusion in extra∣vagant expences render us less able, or less willing, to assist the public, we violate the most sacred of all social duties, and become flagrant transgressors of the will of our Creator.</P>
<P>IT was such a conduct as this which provoked the anger of GOD against the Israelites, when he sent his prophet (Amos) to them with this denun∣ciation: <Q>Wo unto them that are at ease in Zion! ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near! That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, eat the lambs out of the flock, and calves out of the midst of the stall; that chant to the sound of the viol, and invent to themselves instruments of music; that drink wine out of bowls, and anoint themselves with their chief ointments: but are not grieved for the af∣fliction of Joseph!</Q> A beautiful and pathetic de∣scription this of the levity of the Hebrews; who, at a time of public distress, regarded only the in∣dulgence of voluptuous appetites, but never felt one tender sentiment for their bleeding country, "were not grieved for the affliction of Joseph." Thus the children of Israel were brought down (says
<PB REF="015368_0019_0F98D309044B4228"/>
the scripture) in that day, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied on the LORD their GOD. These things were written for our ad∣monition, as well as the Jews; and the wo de∣nounced is equally applicable to any other nation in the like circumstances.</P>
<P>LET us then not build too much upon human prospects, or shut GOD out of our councils and de∣signs; but let us flee humbly to him for succour in a pious acknowledgment, that <Q>without him nothing is strong; that without him no king can be saved by the multitude of an host, nor the mightiest man be delivered by his strength.</Q></P>
<P>OUR unnatural enemies have their earthly king, their lords spiritual and temporal, to apply to on this occasion; let us leave them to their protection, and let us chuse on our part the LORD of lords for our GOD and for our king. In his name have we set up our banners, who alone <Q>giveth victory un∣to kings, and saveth from the peril of the sword.</Q> Let us every one contribute his endeavour to re∣duce and lessen the weight of public guilt by at least reforming and amending himself, and unite in our prayers and in every good work, that <Q>GOD may be entreated for the land.</Q> So we may pi∣ously hope, that he will go forth with our armies, and "command deliverances for Jacob;" that thro' him we shall <Q>cast down our enemies, and keep
<PB REF="015368_0020_0F98D309C62AF6D8"/>
them under that rise up against us.</Q> So shall we not only consult the peace and prosperity of this our Jerusalem, but shall provide in the best manner for our future peace and happiness in a better country, and shall be received as true sons and citi∣zens of that Jerusalem which is above.</P>
<P>TO conclude: Temperance and patriotism go hand in hand, and adhere together by an inseparable connection. And as there can be no real virtue in that breast, which is not susceptible of the love of the public, so there can be no genuine love of the public where virtue is wanting; since that is not only the truest ornament, but the best support of the community. National affection therefore, if it be derived from a true principle, must necessarily inspire a moral conduct, must incline us to quit every baneful vice, to contract the circle even of what we call innocent amusements, and instead of looking out for daily parties of pleasure, it will prompt us rather to make a constant festival of human kindness, the most delicious of all enter∣tainments to a generous mind. If we behave thus, then we are patriots indeed. It is thus we are to arm ourselves against our unprincipled enemies; who, though they should not dread our strength, will certainly stand in awe of our virtue. Whilst we act in this manner, our professions will not only meet with full applause from men, but also with the approbation of GOD, when with the pious ar∣dor
<PB REF="015368_0021_0F98D30A84DD4128"/>
of the text we cry out, <Q>If I forget thee, O Jerusalem! let my right hand forget her cun∣ning: If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth: If I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.</Q> <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
