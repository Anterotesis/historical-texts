<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS induced to undertake the troublesome and diffi∣cult task of collecting and publishing a concise and faithful account of the Climates and Diseases of the United States of America, by a desire of removing the trouble and inconvenience which result from accommodating the rules of practice and forms of prescription made in other coun∣tries to the diseases which occur in this, where the climate, soil, and modes of living of the inhabitants, and of course their constitutions, and the semieology of diseases, even of the same genus, are in many respects different; and by a presumption, that such an account might contribute in some measure to improve the treatment of epidemics, espe∣cially in this country.</P>
<P>WITH these objects in view, I opened a correspondence with several physicians of talents and experience residing in the several states, and with their assistance, joined to my own personal observations, and such information as I could collect from the few books which contain any thing rela∣tive to the subject, have composed the following pages; in
<PB N="2" REF="024239_0004_0FC57208F3F45AA0"/>
which I have endeavoured to exhibit, a synopsis or general view of the situation and climate of each state; and of those diseases in particular which depend upon climate and situ∣ation, (with occasional remarks on others); and an account of the remedies and methods of treatment which have been found most uniformly successful.</P>
<P>AS health is a blessing which enhances the value of every enjoyment, and long life the natural desire of all man∣kind, I have endeavoured to point out the circumstances most favourable thereto, as well as those productive of disease and death. For this purpose I have inserted a number of meteorological tables and bills of mortality.</P>
<P>AS climate and situation have a remarkable influence upon the constitution and health, as well as upon the complexion and figure of mankind, and as the temperature of climate depends upon various circumstances besides latitude, or proximity to the equator; I have been at some pains in endeavouring to shew what those circumstances are, the causes on which they depend, and the means by which they may be altered.</P>
<P>IN the investigation of the nature and causes of diseases, and in determining the effects of remedies, I have been uniformly governed by actual experience, never by hypo∣thesis or plausible conjectures, being convinced that for want of this precaution, the schools of physic have suc∣cessively
<PB N="3" REF="024239_0005_0FC5720A458F81F8"/>
fallen into the most incongruous and palpable errors, and the greatest masters of reasoning have proved the most unsuccessful interpreters of nature's laws.</P>
<P>BUT I am by no means an advocate for the exclusion of reasoning or theory (founded on cautious and judicious in∣duction) from medical pursuits, as has unfortunately of late become too much the fashion.</P>
<P>FOR without reasoning, it would be impossible to acquire a knowledge of the proximate causes of diseases, or the particular conditions of the system on which the symptoms of diseases depend.</P>
<P>AND as there are several diseases of a different nature, and produced by causes entirely different in their operation, which have many symptoms in common; the practitioner who is not possessed of this knowledge, must inevitably commit many fatal mistakes.</P>
<P>BUT this knowledge so indispensibly necessary to enable a physician to distinguish one species of disease from ano∣ther, as well as to discover the indications he ought to pur∣sue in the cure, can only be acquired, (after a previous ac∣quaintance with the structure, connection of parts, and oeconomy of the human body in a sound and healthy state) by much study and reflection, and by the strictest enquiry into the condition of the several functions of the body in disease.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="024239_0006_0FC5720BAC29F820"/>
WHOEVER therefore undertakes the cure of diseases with∣out this knowledge is an empiric, and merits the contempt and detestation of every one who values the lives and safety of his fellow-creatures; for "though he may kill by licence, he can only cure by chance."</P>
<P>THE annals of every age, and the bills of mortality of every country, would, if unveiled, produce proofs as strong as those of Holy Writ, that more lives have been destroyed by the villainy of quacks, and the ignorance and officious∣ness of nostrum-mongers, than by disease, owing to the credulity of the ignorant, and the remissness of go∣vernment: I am, therefore, much surprised that our en∣lightened legislatures (whose duty it is to protect the lives as well as the privileges and property of those whom igno∣rance or want of information renders liable to imposition) have never yet made provision to prevent the like deplora∣ble effects in this country.</P>
<P>THE difficulty of obtaining authentic and satisfactory information on a subject never before attempted in America, has obliged me to leave many parts mutilated and imperfect: and want of sufficient leisure has prevented me from pay∣ing requisite attention to systematic arrangement; but as the work has some claim to originality, abounds with a number of interesting facts, and is intended as an intro∣duction to a complete system of practice, (now ready for the press,) exhibiting all the latest and most important dis∣coveries which have been made in medicine, I trust it will meet with that candour and indulgence to which the best intentions are entitled.</P>

<HEAD>AN HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF THE CLIMATES AND DISEASES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="account">
<HEAD>An ACCOUNT of the DISEASES which occur in the several States of NEW-ENGLAND, viz. NEW-HAMPSHIRE, MASSACHU∣SETTS, RHODE-ISLAND and CONNEC∣TICUT.</HEAD>
<P>"THE Diseases which occur in different parts of these states in the Winter and Spring Seasons among the farmers and mechanics who reside at a distance from the larger trading cities and towns, are principal∣ly the Catarrh—Quinsy—Pleurisy—Rheu∣matism—Tooth-Ach—Inflammation of the
<PB N="2" REF="024239_0008_0FC5721271AFE4F8"/>
Intestines, or of the Peritonaeum—Hectic fe∣vers from internal Abscesses—Phlegmons—Erysipelas—Opthalmia, or Sore Eyes—Spit∣ting of Blood—Bleeding at the Nose—Piles—and sometimes, but rarely, the Scurvy, in fa∣milies that live slovenly and eat nothing but salt meat and stale butter."</P>
<P>"THE greatest number of the disorders which have been enumerated are found to be less frequent in Winter than in the Spring."</P>
<P>THE winds which prevail during the great∣est part of Winter, from the north and north west, though they are severe and piercing cold, occasioned by the great body of snow which covers the immense mountains over which they pass, instead of producing dis∣eases, (by whatever mode of operation cold air acts upon animal bodies,) give vigor to the constitutions, and a freshness and bloom to the complexion of the inhabitants, unknown in southern climates.</P>
<P>"IN the early part of the Spring, 'while the season as yet is unconfirmed, and oft at
<PB N="3" REF="024239_0009_0FC5721440DB2D60"/>
eve resumes the chilly blast,' those diseases are more frequent, but even then they are commonly the effect of imprudent exposure to cold and rainy weather, getting the feet wet, sitting on the damp ground, sleeping in damp sheets, neglecting to change wet clothes after exposure to the rain, &amp;c. &amp;c. or from frequent excesses or debauches in strong liquor, especially of fresh distilled rum."</P>
<P>"THE Small-Pox, which is an exotic dis∣ease, depending on specific infection, though once permitted, is not allowed at present to be communicated by inoculation in these states<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nor in any of the states, except New-York, New-Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and South-Carolina.</NOTE>. Whenever it happens to appear in the natural way, all intercourse is avoided with the infected, except by those who have had the disease; and these last are excluded from all society after their attendance on the sick, till they have performed quarentine, af∣ter the manner of those in other countries who have been infected with the Plague."</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="024239_0010_0FC57219D20C2DA0"/>
"THE diseases which occur in the sum∣mer and autumnal seasons are very few and rare. Those most commonly met with on high and dry situations, are, Phrenitis from Insolation, Diarrhoeas, Choleras, a species of fever attended with symptoms of great debi∣lity, without being infectious or accompani∣ed with any symptom indicative of inflam∣matory Diathesis.—This fever is confined to persons who have been over-fatigued by hard labour during the hot weather."</P>
<P>"IN low marshy situations, where there is much stagnant water, and which are sub∣ject to great inundations from the Spring freshes, intermittents sometimes occur; and when the Summers have been remarkably hot and dry, Remittents, accompanied with bilious symptoms, have frequently been ob∣served to prevail—In the same situations and under apparently similar circumstances, the Dysentery also sometimes occurs, but more particularly among those who live on vegeta∣ble diet and watery drinks."</P>
<P>"IN the populous city of Boston, where
<PB N="5" REF="024239_0011_0FC5721B7B358C08"/>
people of different occupations and profes∣sions are collected together, the catalogue of diseases is greater, and they are more com∣plex and difficult to cure."—This is the case in all large cities where the houses are built close together, and the occupations of the inhabitants are unfavourable to exercise; and the more so, as they recede from habits of temperance; especially where luxury and fa∣shion take the lead of reason and common sense.</P>
<P>THE farmer while he tames the stubborn soil and forces it to reward his labours, insen∣sibly acquires vigour of body and resolution of mind, and at the same time respires a sa∣lubrious air; but manufacturers and mecha∣nics, confined to sedentary occupations, or condemned to vegetate in cellars and close apartments, breathe infection, and their minds become contracted as well as their lives a∣bridged.</P>
<P>IN addition to the diseases already menti∣oned, the following may be numbered as oc∣curring occasionally, though they can not be
<PB N="6" REF="024239_0012_0FC5721D033EB040"/>
ascribed to any peculiarity of climate, soil, or local situation.</P>
<P>"CYNANCHE Maligna, or Putrid Quinsy, Scarlatina Anginosa—Hepatitis—Nephritis—Podagra, or Gout—Phthisis Pulmonalis, (ve∣ry frequent)—Epilepsy—Apoplexy—Palsy—Asthma—Hooping Cough—Colic—Insani∣ty—Melancholy—all the varieties of Dropsy—Hypochondria—Hysteria—Scrophula, &amp;c."</P>
<P>AS the causes of these will be explained hereafter, I shall only observe in this place, that though a course of intemperance never fails of being destructive to health in a longer or shorter time, it is much slower in produ∣cing its effects in these northern states than in those to the southward—Many have been known to live in a high and dry situation in the daily habit of intoxication to old age; and those called soakers or tiplers, who drink a pint or two of rum, or half a gallon or a gal∣lon of cyder per day, and make use of mode∣rate exercise, are seldom known to be troubled with any complaint, but that of hard times and scarcity of money. But the vice of drunk∣enness
<PB N="7" REF="024239_0013_0FC572238CEE0730"/>
does not predominate in this country, as Montesquieu observes it does through others, in proportion to the coldness of the climate. <HI>Vide</HI> Spirit of Laws, Book 14th.</P>
<P>"IN the spring season the inhabitants of Boston are much subject to catarrhal affecti∣ons or coughs, owing to the coldness and moisture of the winds which prevail there at this season. These begin to rise about ten o'clock, A. M. and continue to blow till near sunset."</P>
<P>DOCTOR <HI>Isaac Senter,</HI> in a letter to the au∣thor, dated Newport<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Newport and Providence are the two principal towns in this state: The former lies in latitude 41°, 35′; contains 1000 houses, chiefly of wood, and 5530 inhabitants. This island is 68 miles in length and 40 in breadth. Providence about 30 miles N. W. of Newport—contains 700 houses.</NOTE>, (Rhode-Island) Feb. 19th, 1791, informs him that <Q>The epide∣mics, as well as most of the infectious diseases which visit this island, differ in some respects very considerably from the same complaints in the other sea ports of New-England—The Dysentery is not only less frequent here, but is generally much less mortal. The remit∣ting
<PB N="8" REF="024239_0014_0FC572252C570B30"/>
fevers of the summer and autumn are seldom fatal, and the Putrid Fever, though rarely a native of this island, generally occurs in cold weather.</Q></P>
<Q><P>THE infectious diseases which I have seen here, all except the small-pox, are more mild than elsewhere.</P>
<P>SINCE my remembrance the genuine Intermitting Fever, was very common in dif∣ferent parts of the inland country of New-England; but for twenty years past has sel∣dom been met with any where east of New∣York.</P>
<P>DR. Senter farther remarks, That the reigning epidemics of the different seasons in New-England, are very similar, and the Intermitting Fever is not the only disease that has become very rare within these last twenty years.</P>
<P>PEOPLE in this state are frequently af∣fected with the Diarrhoea or Cholera, after having used violent exertions in the harvest
<PB N="9" REF="024239_0015_0FC57226F17F0158"/>
field, exposed to the insufferable blaze of the sun, after they have eaten too freely of ve∣getable substances and fresh meats, and have drank such drinks as have not been sufficient∣ly fermented.</P>
<P>THE moderate use of rum at such a time has been found serviceable, as it restrains fer∣mentation and prevents debility or relaxation. It also prevents the ill effects which are fre∣quently occasioned by drinking cold water when the body is heated by exercise, and de∣bilitated by the action of excessive heat.</P></Q>
<P>IN this last circumstance, laudanum in small doses mixed with hot toddy or strong tea, and frequently resumed, is a sovereign remedy.</P>
<P>THOUGH Connecticut appears to be sub∣ject to nearly equal degrees of the extremes of cold and heat with Massachusetts and New∣Hampshire, and to more frequent and sud∣den changes of weather, it appears from its almost incredibly rapid increase of population to be more healthy than either of them—but if the reports of travellers are to be credited,
<PB N="10" REF="024239_0016_0FC5722E28841200"/>
it is less so than Rhode-Island, which is em∣phatically called the <HI>Garden of Eden.</HI></P>
<P>THE heats in summer, which are extreme in other parts of New-England, are allayed in Rhode-Island, by the cool and refreshing breezes from the sea. This is to be under∣stood of those parts which approach the sea coast—farther back in the country the sea breezes have less effect, and the weather is consequently less variable. In winter, howe∣ver, they pay dearly for these advantages from exposure to the N. W. wind, the tyrant of this country, which renders this island bleak and uncomfortable.</P>
<P>DR. Foulke, in a discourse which he read lately before the American Philosophical So∣ciety observes, that, "in other countries, men are divided, according to their wealth or in∣digence, into three classes. The opulent, the middling, and the poor; the idleness, luxu∣ries, and debaucheries of the first, and the misery, and too frequent intemperance of the last, destroy a greater proportion of these two; the intermediate class is below those indul∣gences
<PB N="11" REF="024239_0017_0FC5722EED3CD750"/>
which prove fatal to the rich, and above those sufferings to which the unfortu∣nate poor fall victims—this is therefore the happiest division of the three: Of the rich and poor, North-America furnishes a much smaller proportion than any other district of the known world. In Connecticut particu∣larly the distribution of wealth and its con∣comitants is more equal than elsewhere; and therefore, as far as excess or want of wealth may prove destructive or salutary to life, the inhabitants of this state may plead exemp∣tion from disease<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Connecticut is the most populous in proportion to its extent, of any of the thirteen states. It is laid out in small farms, from 50 to 3 or 400 acres each, which are held by the farmers in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee simple; and are generally cultivated as well as the nature of the soil will admit, and the whole state resembles a well cul∣tivated garden. With that degree of industry which contri∣butes to happiness, it produces the necessaries and conveniences of life in great plenty. In 1756 the number of inhabitants in this state was 130, 611—in 1774 there were 197, 856—The increase in 18 years was 67, 245. From 1774 to 1782, the in∣crease was only 11, 294. This comparatively small increase was owing to the destructive effects of the war, and to the nu∣merous emigrations to Vermont and other states. The inha∣bitants of all the states of New-England are almost all of Eng∣lish descent. There are no Dutch, French or Germans, and very few Scotch or Irish among them.</NOTE>."</P>

<P>DISEASES.</P>
<P>HECTICAL cases, and bad Coughs, numer∣ous. Several cases of Pleurisy and Rheuma∣tism—Diarrhoeas numerous, owing perhaps to changing customary clothing.</P>

<P>DISEASES</P>
<P>OF the Alimentary Canal, Diarrhoea, Dy∣spepsia, and Gastrodynioe very rife—Some Dysenteries and Choleras—a few with Pleu∣rodine—Apthae in children—Diseases of va∣rious species, and very numerous.</P>

<P>DYSPEPSIA and Diarrhoea most common; a few cases of Pleurisy, and some of slow continued Fever, (commonly called the long Fever), the same as that described by Hux∣ham under the title of <HI>Slow Nervous Fe∣ver,</HI> and appears to have been occasioned by excessive fatigue, and the application of high∣ly stimulant powers to bodies affected with Nervous Diathesis, i. e. in a defective state of tone.</P>

<P>DISEASES.</P>
<P>THIS month was remarkably heal by; few or no febrile disorders, and not many Phleg∣masiae.</P>
<P>To an account of the diseases to which we are incident in this place (Salem) at the pre∣sent day, it may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> improper to subjoin a few words respecting such as seldom or ne∣ver
<PB N="23" REF="024239_0029_0FC572540CFF87A8"/>
do happen, and of such as were frequent formerly, but seldom or never make their ap∣pearance here at present.</P>
<P>THE first I shall mention is the Rickets. This disease was formerly (about thirty-five or forty years ago) pretty common here, and more especially among negro children, as I very well remember: but is now become so rare that I have not seen it more than three or four times, these eight or ten years, accord∣ing to the best of my remembrance.</P>
<P>DR. Glisson and others, the first writers on Rickets, inform us, that it first made its ap∣pearance about thirty years before they wrote, i. e. about the year 1620, in the counties of Dorset and Somerset, in Great-Britain; which, if true, shows it to be of a very mo∣dern date; and from a chart of the fatal dis∣eases, &amp;c. in London, collected and publish∣ed by Dr. William Black, it appears, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> has been gradually declining in that city these seventy or eighty years past; particu∣larly from 1702 to 1717, (a period of fif∣teen years) there died of the Rickets 3916;
<PB N="24" REF="024239_0030_0FC572552DACFE40"/>
and that from 1762 to 1777, (another period of the same length) there died only 104. All these observations seem to indicate an ut∣ter extinction of this scourge of infants.</P>
<P>ANOTHER is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Colica Pictonum, or Dry Belly-Ach, as it was commonly called▪ This painful and distressing complain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, till about twenty-four or twenty-six years ago, was so frequent, that it was no uncommon thing to have six or eight patients, or more ill of it in a winter, the season in which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mostly prevailed, though it was not confined to cold weather: But now, for these twelve or fifteen years back, I imagine there have not been five persons ill of it in this town, if we except a very few who dealt in lead, and who it was evident derived their disease from that source, such as painters, &amp;c.</P>
<P>THIS species of Colic was formerly attri∣buted to hard drinking; and it is certain that persons addicted to spirituous liquors were generally the subjects of it; but its rare ap∣pearance now cannot be owing to an increase of temperance, for I fear it is a melancholy
<PB N="25" REF="024239_0031_0FC5725A902C6950"/>
that intemperance is as prevalent at this peri∣od as it has been these forty years.</P>
<P>QUERY? Can this difference be account∣ed for from the very general disuse of pewter? Formerly the most usual drinking vessel in the houses of the poorer classes of people, was a pewter quart-pot, and those made use of in eating, such as plates, porringers, &amp;c. were of the same material; which, when not fre∣quently scowered are apt to be converted into ceruss. But the use of pewter is now in gene∣ral disuse, and by the revolution of fashion▪ its place is supplied by more modish stone ware, called <HI>Queen's-Ware.</HI></P>
<P>BOTH the last mentioned diseases, I am informed, are more rare in some of the neigh∣bouring towns than they are in this: as to others I have no information; nor how the case is in the more distant parts of the coun∣try.</P>
<P>PERHAPS it would be interesting to en∣qui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, what diseases have become extinct, or
<PB N="26" REF="024239_0032_0FC5725BF53598E8"/>
very rare among us, and what new ones have succeeded in their room.</P>
<P>WE see no Intermitting Fevers generated here, though 35 or 40 years ago they some∣times occurred.</P>
<P>TYPHUS, both mitior and gravior of Dr. Cullen, were frequent with us from 25 to 35 years ago, especially in Autumn, and proved fatal to many in the vigour and prime of life; it is now comparatively very rare.</P>
<P>SCURVY is a disease we very seldom meet with: Sailors sometimes return from sea with it, and for the most part recover very soon; but I have never met with more than a very few instances of it generated here at home, in the course of my practice.</P>
<P>PUERPERAL Fever very seldom occurs here.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude with observing, what I suppose must have been observed by all the el∣der Practitioners among us, that acute dis∣eases
<PB N="27" REF="024239_0033_0FC5725DE2EDAE50"/>
are much less frequent among us in this town, as well as much less fatal than former∣ly; and that Chronic diseases, particularly Phthisis Pulmonalis, have taken their place; and although our species descend to the grave by paths a little different from the old ones, yet they arrive at it no faster than formerly, as our bills of mortality, in proportion to our numbers, are by no means increased.</P>

<P>IN New-Hampshire, which is situated be∣tween the 42 and 45° of north latitude the land near the sea is generally low; but farther in the country it rises into hills and in some parts, is very mountainous. The highest part of a ridge of mountains in it, which extend N. E. and S. W. are called the <HI>White Mountains.</HI> These mountains are estimated to be 9000 feet above the level of the sea, and are covered with snow and ice nine or ten months in the year, during which time they exhibit that white appearance, from whence they have derived their name. From their summit is exhibited an amazing view, ex∣tending 60 or 70 miles in every direction—And though more than 70 miles within land
<PB N="32" REF="024239_0038_0FC5726DF0F752F8"/>
they may be discerned many leagues off at sea, from whence they appear like an exceed∣ing bright cloud in the horizon. Three of the largest rivers in New-England receive a great part of their waters from these moun∣tains.</P>
<P>THE ground is generally covered with snow the greatest part of the winter: Rain falls but seldom during that season.</P>
<P>THIS state embosoming a number of very high mountains, and lying in the neighbour∣hood of others, whose towering summits are covered with snow and ice three-quarters of the year, is intensely cold in the Winter sea∣son.</P>
<P>THE heat of its Summers, though of short duration, is also intense, especially about noon and a little while after.</P>
<P>CONNECTICUT river passes through the western parts of this state.</P>
<P>PORTSMOUTH, its metropolis, stands on
<PB N="33" REF="024239_0039_0FC5726F6D5072D8"/>
the S. E. of Piscataqua river, about 2 miles from the sea, and contains about 600 houses, and 4400 inhabitants. This is the only port in the state.</P>
<P>THERE are many small streams of water in the state, issuing from the ponds and swamps in the valleys. There are also seve∣ral small lakes, and one near the center of it about 20 miles in length, and from 3 to 8 in breadth.</P>
<Q><P>MASSACHUSETTS is watered and fer∣tilized by the following rivers, viz. Merri∣mak, Charles, which rises from five or six sources, Motherbrook, Taunton, whose source is from the Blue Mountains which lye back of Milton and Braintree, and forms the prin∣cipal drain of the country lying east of these mountains; Concord, formed of 3 branches, one issuing from Framingham pond, the o∣ther two from Marlborough mountains; Mystic and Medford empty into Boston har∣bour; Ipswich empties into the Atlantic at the town of Ipswich; Westfield empties in∣to Connecticut river at Springfield; the
<PB N="34" REF="024239_0040_0FC57274CA5C5BE8"/>
Chicabe empties into the same. Deerfield river rises in Vermont, and passes through a large tract of most excellent meadow; this empties into Connecticut river.</P>
<P>BOSTON, the capital of Massachusetts, contains about 1800 houses, and, according to a late com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>utation, 14,640 inhabitants; of these 6578 were males, and 8070 females.</P></Q>
<P>"THERE are a great many pleasant towns both maritime and inland, in Connecticut. The capitals of the state are, the cities of Hartford and New-Haven. The former is situated at the head of navigation on the west side of the majestic and spacious river Con∣necticut, about 15 miles above its entrance into the Sound: The number of houses do not exceed 300. New-Haven is situated at the head of a bay, on a plain circumscribed on three sides by high hills—and is bounded east and west by two small rivers," contains only 500 dwelling houses made of timber. The number of males in the whole state ex∣ceeded the number of females by 1570; but
<PB N="35" REF="024239_0041_0FC572762F605390"/>
in New-Haven there were found in 1787, to be 49 females more than males.</P>

ABOUT 1 in 70 dies annually in New-Ha∣ven.</P>
<P>THE Small-Pox, by the vigilant execu∣tion of the laws subsisting in the several New-England states, has never prevailed ge∣nerally among the inhabitants, except in Boston, where it was epidemical, A. D. 1649, 1666, 1678, 1689, 1702, 1721, 1730, 1752, and in 1764, and where the success attending inoculation, though at that time in its infant and imperfect state, became in∣contestibly evident.</P>
<P>IN New-York, Pennsylvania, &amp;c. the like precautions have not been taken, and the Small-Pox has been often epidemic there, especially in their capital towns—and inocu∣lation has been practised with almost incre∣dible success, whenever the cold and abste∣mious regimen has been observed, notwith∣standing the too liberal and injudicious use of mercury. Since the practice of giving mercury has been growing into disrepute, and another more simple, consisting princi∣pally of mild laxatives, vegetable diet, and
<PB N="37" REF="024239_0043_0FC5727BF7129A30"/>
exposure to a colder temperature than usual during the eruptive Fever, there is scarce an instance of one in a thousand dying of this disease.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though the reverend C. Mather, one of the principal mi∣nisters of Boston, recommended it to the physicians, to make the experiment of inoculation, when the mortality in the na∣tural way was very distressing, they all declined it except Dr. Boylston, who began with his own children and servants: For this innovation he was considered as an impious person by the generality of his fellow-citizens, and suffered much in his in∣terest on that account. Mr. Mather had read a favourable ac∣count of the operation in the Philosophical Transactions, com∣municated by Timotheus from Constantinople.</NOTE> A. D. 1721, the number of individuals in Boston was 10,567, at which time the disease was very common. The number of those who died of it was 844, which was, according to Mr. Gales calculation in his Historical Memoirs, about one in seven. At this time only 286 were inoculated in and about Boston, whereof 6 died, i.e. 1 in 48. This was the first introduction of ino∣culation into America. It was introduced into London about the same time by Lady W. Montague in the reign of George the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="024239_0044_0FC5727F44C3F0B0"/>
A. D. 1730—Of 4000, which had the disease in the natural way, about 500 died, i.e. in the proportion of 125 to every thou∣sand. Of nearly 400 inoculated, 12 died, or about 1 of 33.</P>
<P>A.D. 1752, there was an exact account taken, by order of the magistrates of the town of Boston, and rendered upon oath, (in order to remove the prejudices and objections made against inoculation) of all who had the small pox, either in the natural way, or by inocula∣tion, and of the precise number of those who died of it in either way: By this account it appears that the number of those who had the disease in the natural way, including blacks, amounted to 5544; of which num∣ber there died, including blacks, 574—The whole number inoculated, including blacks, was 2113, of which 30 died. At this time all present had the Small-Pox, except about 174; the total of residenters at that time (including 1544 negroes) was 9710. Those who fled to escape the Small-Pox were esti∣mated at 1800.</P>
<P>IN 1764, of 3000 inoculated patients, on∣ly
<PB N="39" REF="024239_0045_0FC57280AE842078"/>
5 died, and these were children under five years of age.</P>
<P>THREE hospitals were afterwards erected in different parts of Massachusetts, for the purpose of receiving patients desirous of be∣ing inoculated, and regulated in such man∣ner, as to prevent the infection from spread∣ing, or being communicated to any of the rest of the inhabitants, as was expected; but through some trespass of the rules, and the refractory disposition of some of the patients, the whole utility of the institution was frus∣trated: Whereupon the law permitting ino∣culation was repealed, and another passed prohibiting it under severe penalties. Since that time, any person who has the mis∣fortune to enter that state with the dis∣ease, or any of the infection adhering to his apparel or goods, and any one is thereby in∣fected with the disease, he is liable to pay to the party so infected treble damages and costs of suit.</P>
<P>THUS the practice of inoculation for the Small-Pox stands wholly interdicted within
<PB N="40" REF="024239_0046_0FC57284E67CA558"/>
the New-England states, and the inhabitants are deprived, through a mistaken policy, of rendering one of the most formidable and loathsome diseases mild and harmless.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE CLIMATE AND DISEASES OF NEW-YORK.</HEAD>
<P>THE diseases which occur in the seve∣ral parts of this state, differ so little in number, nature, and causes, from those of the New-England states, that I think it un∣necessary to enumerate any except those pe∣culiar to the fashionable and luxurious.</P>
<P>"THIS state extends from the 40 to the 45th degree north latitude, is bounded south eastwardly by the Atlantic ocean; east by Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Vermont; north by the 45th degree of latitude, which divides it from Canada; southwest and south by Pennsylvania and New-Jersey. It is in∣tersected in different parts by ridges of moun∣tains,
<PB N="42" REF="024239_0048_0FC57288F27AB6D8"/>
running in a north east and south west direction." These mountains occasion the winds in winter to be very cold and piercing, (for the air on mountains is always cold in proportion to their height.)</P>
<P>THE difference between the constitutions of the inhabitants of the city and country parts of New-York is almost incredible. Inflam∣matory diseases are much less frequent in the city than in the country, and in general are much less rapid and violent in their progress than formerly: Nor do they admit of the same antiphlogistic method of cure which is found necessary with people whose occupati∣ons require exercise in the open air.</P>
<P>AN active farmer, with an acute rheuma∣tism, often requires the loss of 60 or 70 ounces of blood in the course of the disease; but the citizen, confined to a sedentary occupation, can seldom bear half that quantity.</P>
<P>THE citizens are affected with a numer∣ous train of Nervous complaints, of which the inhabitants of the country have no idea.
<PB N="43" REF="024239_0049_0FC5728A6BEEDF38"/>
These appear to influence all their other com∣plaints. Great numbers of them are enfeebled and enervated; and it is not uncommon to observe high degrees of irritability under the external appearance of firmness and vigor.</P>
<P>THE Hypochondria, Palsies, Cachexies, Dropsies, and all those diseases which arise from laxity and debility are at this period endemic not only in New-York, but also in Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore; and the Hysterics, which used to be peculiar to fe∣males, as the name indicates, now attacks many of both sexes indiscriminately. It is evident that so great a revolution in the con∣stitutions of people could not be effected without the concurrence of many causes. Among the principal of these may be ranked, sedentary occupations, the intemperate use of spirituous liquors, and the daily use of strong tea.</P>
<P>THAT a strong infusion of hyson tea is an exceedingly powerful stimulant to the Nerv∣ous system, and intoxicates like spiritous li∣quors, must be manifest to every one who has
<PB N="44" REF="024239_0050_0FC5728FA3CF7718"/>
ever observed a number of ladies assembled at a <HI>tea table.</HI> It is on its narcotic or intoxi∣cating quality, that its pernicious effects depend.</P>
<P>BUT the greatest evils which contract the duration, and embitter the enjoyments of life, are derived from the sources of sloth, intem∣perance and irregular desires.</P>
<P>THE narrowness, irregularity, and con∣fined situation of many of the streets and buildings in the city of New-York, ren∣der it much more liable to diseases than Bos∣ton, and notwithstanding its superior situati∣on, it is more subject to sickness, during the Summer and Autumnal seasons, than Phila∣delphia. Whether its water, which is bra∣kish and unpalatable, contributes to this cir∣cumstance or not, has never been satisfacto∣rily ascertained.</P>
<P>THE narrowness and irregular form of its streets, the height of the houses, and the
<PB N="45" REF="024239_0051_0FC57290ED2A4568"/>
crowded manner in which they are built, oc∣casion it to be insufferably hot in summer.</P>
<P>THE number of inhabitants in the whole state, in January, 1791, was computed to be 324,127, of which 18,000 were negroes. The number in the city was 27,000, besides strangers and sailors.</P>
<P>A COMPARATIVE view of the state of this city at present, with that which it exhibited 30 years ago, is flattering to the present age, par∣ticularly in the improvements in literature, architecture, elegance and politeness.</P>

<HEAD>Of the CLIMATE of NEW-YORK</HEAD>
<HEAD>The following is an Abstract of Dr. Mitchell's Remarks respecting the Climate of New∣York.</HEAD>
<Q><P>IT has been long known that the tem∣peratures of countries are to be estima∣ted, not merely by the distance from the equa∣tor, but also by their remoteness from the margin and level of the ocean.</P>
<P>THE following facts will, perhaps, enable you to form some idea of the difference be∣tween this climate and some others under the same parallel.</P>
<P>IN July, 1788, the mercury in Farenheit's thermometer rose in my chamber in the city of New-York, as high as the 103d degree above 0. And in Februry, 1789 at Albany, it sunk to the 24th degree below 0, by the na∣tural changes of the weather.</P>
<P>LIGHTNING, during Summer and Au∣tumn, is very frequent, particularly near the
<PB N="49" REF="024239_0055_0FC5729AF5FE8668"/>
islands and sea coasts: And (for what rea∣son I do not well understand) the thunder showers almost invariably come from the north west.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable that the flash will kill vegetables no less suddenly than animals, by depriving them of their excitability, or suscep∣bility of being excited by the stimuli neces∣sary to life, rather than by destroying their organization; for animated matter becomes defunct in three ways: 1st. By a destruction of organization, as by mortal wounds. 2d. When the organization is intire, but its capa∣city to receive the impressions of stimuli is taken away, as by long exposure to fixed, or phlogisticated air, or by excessive electrical shocks; and 3d. Where the organ and ca∣pacity are complete, but where, however, no stimuli are applied, as in seeds and in eggs before impregnation, and in animals, not irrecoverably drowned, before resuscitation.</P>
<P>ON Long-Island, Indian corn is planted after the beginning or about the middle of May; and the new crop is fit for grinding in 150 days; but the same kind of grain brought
<PB N="50" REF="024239_0056_0FC5729F06B5F4E0"/>
from Nova-Scotia, grows here to maturity in 96 days, while that brought from Carolina, does not ripen in less than 190. Buck-wheat grows from the seed to perfection in 84 days.</P>
<P>FROST commonly occurs in every month of the year, excepting June, July, and Au∣gust; and has now and then even happened in June and August. It comes frequently about the first of September; and I remember on the 4th of May, 1774, a considerable quantity of snow fell.</P>
<P>IN the Spring the blossoms of peach, apple, and other fruit-trees, and the sprouting foli∣age of plants, are often hurt by it; but from causes which I do not fully comprehend, it prevails most in low lands, valleys and plains<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this explained under the account of the Climate of Virginia.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DROUGHT of six or eight weeks continu∣ance sometimes parch us, and again rain falls to the depth of five or six inches on a level, in four hours. Winds are very variable; the sea breezes, which blow from the south, are our warmest in Winter, and from the north
<PB N="51" REF="024239_0057_0FC572A2464EAB78"/>
west, our coolest in Summer. In the Win∣ter the north west winds are the most boister∣ous and piercing: though the north east are generally attended with storms of snow and sleet.</P>
<P>THE abundance of melting snow and ice, which frequently overspreads the country, far and near, subjects those whose feet are expo∣sed to the sloppy colliquation, to Colds, Ca∣tarrhs, Coughs, and their consequences.</P></Q>
<P>MR. Kalm remarks, that at "Albany the wind blows commonly from the south in Summer, and brings a great drought along with it. Sometimes it rains a little, after which the wind veers to N. W. blowing for several days from that point, and then re∣turning to the south." <HI>See</HI> Kalm's Travels, Vol. II. page 243.</P>
<P>THE same gentleman informs us, that the cold is generally very severe on the river Hud∣son; at Albany, in the middle of winter, the ice is sometimes three or four feet thick. "On the 3d of April, 1749, some of the inha∣bitants
<PB N="52" REF="024239_0058_0FC572A32C2FA540"/>
crossed the river with six pair of horses. The ice commonly dissolves here about the latter end of March or beginning of April. The water at this time, some years, rises three fathom higher than it commonly is in sum∣mer. The inhabitants make no use of stoves, and their chimneys are so wide as to admit a cart and horses to be driven through them.</P>
<P>"THE water of the wells (continues Mr. Kalm) in this town was very cool, when I was there in June 1749, but had a kind of acid taste, which was not very agreeable. It also contained a number of little insects which were probably <HI>Monoculi:</HI> These in∣sects were from one and an half geometrical line to four in length."</P>
<P>MR. Kalm thinks this water not whole∣some, but the inhabitants who drink it every day, do not feel the least inconvenience from it. Albany is about 146 miles from New∣York.</P>
<Q><P>THE Rheumatism and Pleurisy are the most common diseases in this part of Ame∣rica.
<PB N="53" REF="024239_0059_0FC572A79DBC3A78"/>
Intermittents and Dysenteries are sel∣dom heard of. The Phlogistic Diathesis is so prevalent, that the physicians use venaesec∣tion for almost every complaint, and at every season of the year.</P>
<P>THE excessive heat, however, which prevails here from the middle of July to the latter end of August, sometimes gives rise to fevers attended with very anomalous symp∣toms, which often baffle the sagacity of the most experienced practitioners.</P></Q>

<HEAD>The following Information respecting the Dis∣eases, depending on Climate and situation was communicated to the Author by Dr. John Jones of Philadelphia, formerly Professor of Surge∣ry, &amp;c. at King's College, New-York—<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">DR. Jones died since the above was communicated.</NOTE> at present Vice-President of the College of Phy∣sicians of Philadelphia.</HEAD>
<Q><P>IN the Winter and Spring the following diseases are more or less epidemic eve∣ry year in the city of New-York, viz.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="024239_0060_0FC572AAE7F0B370"/>
Inflammatory Quinsy—The Suffocating Cartarrh of children—The common Catarrh—Peripneumony—Pleurisy—Hepatitis, and Rheumatism.</P>
<P>THE Nephritis, Cystitis and Hysteritis, occur at all seasons.</P>
<P>THE epidemics of Summer, are only Cholera and Diarrhoea.</P>
<P>IN Autumn there seldom or ever occurs any epidemic which can be ascribed to the influence of the climate or situation, except Diarrhoeas, accompanied with Griping; but these are rather sporadic than epidemic, ex∣cept when a rainy Autumn succeeds a hot and dry Summer." These Diarrhoeas, how∣ever, according to Dr. Jones's observations, frequently terminate in very dangerous Dy∣senteries.</P></Q>
<P>HE has also sometimes observed Intermit∣ting and Remitting Fevers to be very gene∣ral after the autumnal equinox, when the season has been rainy; though there are
<PB N="55" REF="024239_0061_0FC572AC2C8AFFF8"/>
no sources of Marsh Miasmata; neither marshy grounds, nor ponds of standing water within its vicinity. About a mile above the city there is one pond, from whence the city is supplied with fresh water; but it is always pure.</P>
<Q><P>THOUGH the diseases which are menti∣oned as occurring in Winter and Spring, are most common at those seasons, they also occur in some constitutions every month of the year.</P>
<P>THOSE diseases produced by luxury, de∣bauchery, and idleness, are the same every where.</P></Q>

<HEAD>OF THE DISEASES WHICH OCCUR IN NEW-JERSEY.</HEAD>
<P>THE diseases which occur in the eastern part of this state (which extends to the 41st degree of north latitude), where the land is elevated and dry, are the same with those of Pennsylvania, in similar circumstances; but in the west division of the state, as well as in the counties on the sea-coast, and the marshy bottoms along the numerous creeks with which it is supplied, the inhabitants are much more subject to Intermittents and Bilious complaints.</P>
<P>THE parts which are dry, sandy, and pro∣duce nothing but pine and spruce, are famous
<PB N="57" REF="024239_0063_0FC572B3B279A568"/>
for prolific women, from whence the ladies of Philadelphia, who are not able to endure the fatigue and trouble of nursing their off∣spring, are furnished with wet nurses.</P>
<P>THE flat and marshy parts of this state, which are very numerous, are infested with myriads of musquetoes, which give intolera∣ble annoyance to man and beast.—Their bites often occasion an Erysipelas, both painful and dangerous. These insects, however, are ne∣ver observed to be troublesome when the mer∣cury is below the 60th degree. I do not know the degree of cold which renders bugs inactive, but have been kept awake by them at Salem, as late as the 10th of November.</P>
<P>PERTH Amboy, the most beautifully situ∣ated town in this state, affords a picturesque and romantic view, and is one of the most healthy places in the state.</P>
<P>"WE may generally determine the rela∣tive healthiness of any situation and climate, from a knowledge of the prevailing state of the weather. Cold and moisture occasion
<PB N="58" REF="024239_0064_0FC572B80CD93EE0"/>
inflammatory complaints, in all countries and climates, if intense, and especially if pre∣ceded by hot weather. While heat and mois∣ture combined, especially in situations not favourable for ventilation, commonly produce Intermittent or Bilious complaints."</P>
<P>IT is from the situation and climate of countries that we are to compute the proba∣bilities of enjoying health and prolonging life. In all the low marshy situations of this state, I know from personal observation, that the inhabitants are generally sickly, many of which are Leucophlegmatic and Dropsical—The women frequently Chloriotic, are gene∣rally pale, squalid, and have carious teeth: But in the high, dry, and mountainous parts, they are healthy and long-lived.</P>
<Q><P>THE most unwholesome situations, and soils the most unproductive, may be render∣ed salutary by industry and art.</P>
<P>THE dykes and drains of Holland, which carry off immense quantities of water into the ocean, prevent or destroy one of the
<PB N="59" REF="024239_0065_0FC572BAF6D5A8A0"/>
principal sources of Fevers, the generation of Marsh Miasmata.</P></Q>
<P>"DR. De Monchy, an eminent physician at Rotterdam, observes, that vapours and ex∣halations, driven by a land wind, seawards, are found salubrious or morbific, according to the quality of the soil, whether sandy, gravelly, loamy, or marshy; yet the healthy state of some English men of war, under the command of commodore Mitchell, which lay at anchor in the channel, between South Beveland and the island of Walcheren, parts of the Province of Zealand, in both of which places the Fever raged alike among the na∣tives and the English soldiers cantoned there, is a proof that the moist and putrid airs of the waters, mud and marshes, was dissipated or corrected before it reached them; and that a situation open on all sides to the wind, is one of the best preservatives against the ma∣ladies of a neighbouring, low, and marshy country." De Monchy's Essay on the Causes and Cure of Diseases, in Voyages to the West-Indies, page 12.</P>
<P>THE Dysentery prevailed in Salem, and
<PB N="60" REF="024239_0066_0FC572BBEF02AB00"/>
the adjacent country, which borders upon the Delaware, and is very low and marshy, in September, 1788; but from its readily yielding to the cortex, in substance, combined with very small doses of species <HI>e scordio cum opio,</HI> it appears to have been intirely symptomatic, and not a primary disease; for, wherever it is a primary disease, and the griping and tenesmus are the leading symptoms, the disease can not be cured with∣out repeated purging in the day time, and the exhibition of opium at night. Under such circumstances, the frequent exhibition of sti∣mulating remedies, astringents, cordials, and opiates are generally injurious, and frequent∣ly fatal.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="excerpt">
<HEAD>Extract of a Letter from Dr. P. MASHEAU, residing at Elizabeth-Town, (communicated in 1791.)</HEAD>
<Q><P>NOT a doubt remains with me, that the Dysentery is not an inflammato∣tory affection of the Bowels, as Akenside and others have supposed, but a contagious Fe∣ver,
<PB N="61" REF="024239_0067_0FC572BD6E1DDCC8"/>
accompanied with frequent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ols, se∣vere pain and griping, followed by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nesmus.</P>
<P>THE places where this malady is most frequently observed are morasses; and the bowels are particularly disposed to be affect∣ed by it, where people make use of fermen∣tative liquors too freely: For instance, near this place there is a little village called Spring∣field, where the inhabitants (who drink large quanties of Spruce beer) are very subject to to this disease, after the middle of August; which, I am persuaded, in conjunction with the relaxing effects of their local situation, is the principal cause of their being so subject to it.</P>
<P>I HAVE never seen any harm done by the Purpurea Digitalis in any species of Drop∣sy; on the contrary, I have exhibited it late∣ly, in form of <HI>extract,</HI> with very great success.</P>
<P>I TRIED its virtues on a patient in a ve∣ry debilitated condition after the operation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the paracentesis. The bark of Peru was gi∣ven along with it, which, together with the
<PB N="62" REF="024239_0068_0FC572C233C612F8"/>
exercise of riding on horseback, prevented any farther accumulation of water, and ef∣fected a cure. But unless the Digitalis is assist∣ed by exercise and tonics, &amp;c. it is seldom of much avail.</P>
<P>I HAVE never seen the Hydrocephalus, you mention, cured subsequent to symptoms of Strabismus occurring, but have three times seen it cured prior to the occurrence of this symptom, by the Ung. Merc. rubbed on the skin covering the Carotids, in large quan∣tities. Worms are, no doubt, a frequent cause of Fever; but, at the same time, are of advantage by the irritation they produce on the absorbent system. I have never seen the Tetanus cured by Dr. Rush's method; but cured two patients lately with opium and mercurial ointment.</P>
<P>THE Typhus is never generated in this town to my knowledge, nor do I recollect to have met with a case of Fever that was con∣tagious since my residence here.</P>
<P>LOCAL affections are the exciting causes

<HEAD>OF THE SITUATION, CLIMATE, AND DISEASES OF PENNSYLVANIA.</HEAD>
<P>THIS state is situate between 39° 43′ and 42° north latitude; peninsulated by six considerable rivers, whose numerous branches supply it with inexhaustible streams of the purest water.</P>
<P>THE ground rises almost imperceptibly as we proceed westward, for more than 200 miles; after which it becomes very mountain∣ous and rocky, and so continues, till we pass the great range of the Alleghany, from whence to the gently flowing Ohio, the
<PB N="65" REF="024239_0071_0FC572C72BADFDD8"/>
ground is very much broken and uneven; being a repetition of ridge after ridge, but no mountains.</P>
<P>THERE are very few tracts of swamp or marshy ground in this state, except along the Delaware and Susquehanna. The greatest part of the state is divided into small planta∣tions, which, in general, are in a tolerable, but by no means in a perfect, state of cultiva∣tion.</P>
<P>PHILADELPHIA, at present the metropo∣lis of the United States, when the last census was taken, contained 42,400 inhabitants, in∣cluding all ages, sexes, and descriptions; and 6651 dwelling-houses, exclusive of stores and work-shops, &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Philadelphia Directory, by Clement Biddle, Esq.</NOTE></P>

This tract of ground is also converted into immensely productive meadows, by the art of cultivation.</P>

<HEAD>An ACCOUNT of the Quality of the WATER at PHILADELPHIA.</HEAD>
<P>THE greatest part of the pump-water of Philadelphia, which is the only kind that is drank or made use of for tea-water, or culinary purposes by the inhabitants, is im∣pregnated with selenite, or a combination of mineral acid with calcareous earth.</P>
<P>WHEN this water boils, a whitish powder is separated from it, which forms a crust on all the vessels in which it is frequently boil∣ed.</P>
<P>THIS water is called hard, because it does not mix uniformly with soap, but curdles or runs into flakes.</P>
<P>A SMALL quantity of the sal. tartari, or clean dry pot-ash, added to this water pre∣cipitates the selenite contained in it. Ten or fifteen grains are commonly sufficient to pre∣cipitate what is contained in a pint. The exact proportion may always be found by ad∣ding
<PB N="68" REF="024239_0074_0FC572D02FD66620"/>
a few grains from time to time till it ceases to occasion white clouds.</P>
<P>THIS water is very disagreeable to the pa∣lates of most people who reside at a distance from the city, and is sometimes offensive to their stomachs and bowels. But custom has rendered it both agreeable and wholesome to the inhabitants; so that they have not a wish for any other.</P>
<P>IT is a common opinion that water im∣pregnated with calcareous earth, or any sto∣ny matter, subjects those who make constant use of it to the Stone or Gravel. But what∣ever other mischief these waters may have to answer for, they are innocent of this. For very few, comparatively, of the inhabitants of this city are troubled with that disease. Besides, there are numerous circumstances recorded which prove, that calculous con∣cretions in the kidneys and bladder are all of an animal origin, intirely different from every species of fossil stone in every thing except the name.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="024239_0075_0FC572D1ABE939E8"/>
THERE are several medicinal springs in Pennsylvania impregnated with iron, but none with aerial acid, or fixed air, as yet known.</P>
<P>THOSE most noted are, one called Harrow∣gate, four miles from Philadelphia—one at Bristol, on the river Delaware, twenty miles above the city—one in Chester county, cal∣led the Yellow Spring, about thirty-two miles from the city.</P>
<P>BRISTOL and the Yellow Spring are much neglected for want of suitable accom∣modations; but Harrowgate, where the en∣tertainment and accommodations are toler∣able, is much frequented, though it is by no means so strong a Chalybeate as either of the others.</P>
<P>THAT the yellow Spring, in Chester coun∣ty, is strongly impregnated with iron, is rendered certain by the following circum∣stances: The conduits, or canals, through which the water passes, are lined with a yel∣low scum like ochre, as well as the basons
<PB N="70" REF="024239_0076_0FC572D6D19D1050"/>
and reservoirs into which it is received. This yellow matter, collected, washed, dried, and thoroughly roasted over a strong fire, is capable of being attracted by the magnet; and, when sublimed with sal ammoniac into flowers, and afterwards dissolved in spirits of wine, affords a bright and styptic tincture of iron. Other concurring remarks of their chalybeate nature, are likewise afforded by the purple colour they make when mixed with a strong infusion of green tea, and of a blacker colour with powder of galls, and the iron mould they occasion upon linen—The same dried scum, being digested in volatile alkaline spirits, will occasion a blue colour when mixed with common water. These waters also impart an astringent or styptic taste to the tongue—these are all certain cha∣racteristics of a fine irony rust, or the real and material existence of iron in these waters.</P>
<P>FROM the sensible quality of these waters they appear to be perfectly neutralized, for they have not the least taste of acidity.</P>
<P>CHEMICAL experiments prove that no
<PB N="71" REF="024239_0077_0FC572D7B633BF68"/>
metals are soluble, or can possibly enter the composition of water, unless the metal be first dissolved or converted into a salt, or vitriol.</P>
<P>OF all the metals there is none that dis∣solves so readily, in all kinds of acids, as iron. Thus pure water itself, on account of the fixed air, or aerial acid, which enters its composition, soon dissolves, and forms a uni∣on with this metal. A piece of red hot iron, quenched in water, communicates an astrin∣gency to it; and it is a familiar observation, that the moisture of the air, rain, &amp;c. corrodes iron, turns it into rust, and impregnates itself therewith. In the same manner all springs which wash the beds of iron ore, or pass through red clay grounds, become impregna∣ted with iron<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Those chalybeate waters, in which the impregnation of fixed air, now called the aerial acid, predominates, are the best. An artificial mineral water of this kind may be made by dissolving one grain of sal mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is, in a pint of spring water, and impregnating with fixed air, from a mixture of oil of vitriol and chalk, by means of Nooth's machine.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>Of the CLIMATE of PENNSYLVANIA.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The following Account of the Climate of Penn∣sylvania, is extracted principally from the Observations of Dr. Rush.</HEAD>
<P>THE river Delaware was frozen over near three months during the Winter of 1780: The thickness of the ice in the river, near the city of Philadelphia, was from 16 to 19 inches, and the depth of the frost in the ground was from four to five feet, according to the exposure of the ground and the qua∣lity of the soil.</P>
<P>IN the month of January, the mercury stood for several hours at 5 degrees below 0, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>enheit's thermometer, and during the whole of this month it never rose, except one day in the city of Philadelphia, to the freez∣ing point.</P>
<P>"THE cold of the Winter of 1783—4 was as intense, but not so steady as that of 1780—A thaw took place in January, this
<PB N="73" REF="024239_0079_0FC572DFB7F50ED8"/>
year, which rendered the Delaware naviga∣ble for a few days.</P>
<P>THE Summer which succeeded the Win∣ter of 1780, was uniformly warm. The mercury in the thermometer, during this Summer, stood on one day, the 15th of Au∣gust, at 95°, and fluctuated between 93 and 80° for many weeks. The thermometer stood in the shade in the open air.</P>
<P>THERE are seldom more than 20 or 30 days in Summer or Winter, in Pennsylva∣nia, in which the mercury rises above 80° in the former, or falls below 30° in the lat∣ter season.</P>
<P>THE warmest part of the day, in Summer, is at 2 o'clock in ordinary, and at 3 in the afternoon in extremely warm weather.—From these hours the heat gradually dimi∣nishes till the ensuing morning.—The cool∣est part of the 24 hours is at the break of day.</P>
<P>THERE are seldom more than three or
<PB N="74" REF="024239_0080_0FC572E174FE6030"/>
four nights in a Summer, in which the heat of the air is nearly the same as in the preceding day.—After the warmest days, the evenings are generally agreeable, and of∣ten delightful.—The higher the Mercury rises in the day time, the lower it falls the succeeding night. When the Mercury is at 80° it generally falls to 68° while it descends when at 60° only to 56°. This disproportion between the temperature of the day and night in Summer, is always greatest in the month of August. The dews at this time are heavy in proportion to the coolness of the evening: They are some∣times so considerable as to wet the clothes; and there are instances, in which marsh-mea∣dows, and even creeks, which have been dry during the Summer, have been supplied with their usual waters, from no other source than the dews which have fallen in this month, or in the first weeks of September. There is another circumstance connected with the one just mentioned, which contributes very much to mitigate the heat of Summer; and that is, it seldom continues more than two or three days very great without being succeeded by showers of
<PB N="75" REF="024239_0081_0FC572E2EDFA91A0"/>
rain, accompanied sometimes by thunder and lightning, and succeeded by a north west wind, which produces a coolness in the air, that is highly invigorating and agreea∣ble.</P>
<P>THE warmest weather is generally in the month of July, but intensely warm days are often felt in May, June, August, and Sep∣tember, (particularly in the two last menti∣oned months.)</P>
<P>THE transitions from heat to cold are often very sudden, and sometimes to very distant degrees. After a day in which the mercury has stood at 86° and even 90°, it has sometimes fallen, in the course of a single night, to the 65th and often to the 60th degree. In a Sum∣mer month, in the year 1775, the mercury was observed to fall 20° in an hour and an half. The weather is equally variable during the greatest part of the Winter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"The weather on the west side of the great range of mountains, collectively called the Alleghany Mountains, is much more temperate and regular than on the east side. The inhabitants never feel those quick transitions of the wind from north and south, as those so frequently experience, who live eastward of the mountains, and near the sea. The hot south∣wardly winds become chilled by passing over the long chain of these mountains." <HI>Morse's Geography.</HI></NOTE>. The mercury
<PB N="76" REF="024239_0082_0FC572E998D88CC8"/>
fell from 37 to 4½° below 0, in 24 hours, between the 4th and 5th of February, 1788.</P>
<P>THE rivers Delaware, Schuylkill, and Susquehanna, have been frozen so as to bear horses and carriages of all kinds; and thawed, to be passable in boats, two or three times in the course of the same Winter.</P>
<P>DEWS begin to fall very copiously in August.</P>
<P>THE time in which frost and ice begin to shew themselves in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia, is generally about the latter end of October, or beginning of November; but the intense cold seldom sets-in before the 20th or 25th of December. The coldest weather is commonly in January. A cold day in Winter is often succeeded by a mode∣rate evening.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="024239_0083_0FC572EC9FE21430"/>
THE greatest degree of cold which has been observed at Philadelphia, within the last 20 years, is 5° below 0; and the greatest degree of heat upon record, in the same place is 95°.</P>
<P>THE standard temperature of the air is 52½, which is the temperature of our deep∣est wells; as also the mean heat of the com∣mon spring water.</P>
<P>THE Spring in Pennsylvania, is generally less pleasant than in many other countries. In March, the weather is stormy, variable, and cold. In April, and sometimes in the beginning of May, it is moist, and accompa∣nied by a degree of cold, which has been cal∣led rawness, and which, from its disagree∣able effects upon the temper, may be called the <HI>Sirocco</HI> of this country.</P>
<P>THE month of May, in 1786, will long be remembered, for having furnished a very uncommon instance of the absence of the Sun for 14 days, and of constant damp or rainy weather.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="024239_0084_0FC572ED7156F370"/>
THE month of June<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">June, 1791, was an exception to these observations, for the heat was intense, and had been so from the latter end of May. The wind blew constantly from the S. and S. W.</NOTE> is the only month in the year which resembles a Spring month in the southern countries of Europe. The wea∣ther is then generally temperate, the sky is serene, and the verdure of the country is uni∣versal and delightful.</P>
<P>THE Autumn is the most agreeable season of the year in Pennsylvania. The cool eve∣nings and mornings, which generally begin about the first week in September, are suc∣ceeded by a moderate temperature of the air during the day. This weather continues with a gradual and almost imperceptible in∣crease of cold, till after the middle of Octo∣ber: After which more rain falls, and cold∣ness succeeds. The indians predict the cold of Winter from the quantity of rain which falls during the Autumn<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The greater the moisture, the greater will be the evapo∣ration, and the greater the evaporation, the greater will be the coldness of the atmosphere.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>IN Winter the winds generally come from
<PB N="79" REF="024239_0085_0FC572EEF3372908"/>
the north west in fair, and from the north east in wet weather. The former are un∣commonly dry as well as cold, the latter are insufferably cold and moist.</P>
<P>THE winds in fair weather in the Spring, and in warm weather in the Summer, gene∣rally blow from the south west, and from west north west. The south west winds fre∣quently bring with them refreshing showers, and moderate the heat of the weather, par∣ticularly when succeeded by a north west wind.</P>
<P>THE dissolution of the ice and snow in the Spring, is sometimes so sudden as to swell the creeks and rivers in every part of the state, to overwhelm large tracts of land in their vi∣cinity, and destroy the crops of the disap∣pointed farmer and grazier. The wind at these times commonly comes from the south west.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It appears from Mr. Kalm's Travels, that the Winter set in sooner formerly than it did when he was in America, which was from 1748 to 1751.</P>
<P>According to the account which he received from Isaac Nor∣ris, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> the river Delware, when the English first settled in Pennsylvania, was commonly covered with ice about the mid∣dle of November, old stile; so that the merchants were obliged to clear out their ships before that time, for fear of the naviga∣tion's being obstructed if they delayed. On the contrary, adds Mr. Kalm, this river seldom freezes over, at present, before the middle of December, old stile. The Spring returns here much later than formerly.</P></NOTE> IT is a prevailing opinion, that the ex∣tremes
<PB N="80" REF="024239_0086_0FC572F3656768B0"/>
of heat, moisture, and cold, are an∣nually diminishing in this state, by the clear∣ing of woods, draining of swamps, and o∣ther arts of cultivation.</P>
<Q><P>THOUGH the Sun (says Doctor Hugh Williamson) is doubtless the general source of heat, yet we observe that countries are not heated in proportion to their distance from the Sun, nor in proportion to their distance from the Equator. When the rays of the Sun strike the earth in a perpendicular direc∣tion, they will be reflected in the same direc∣tion on the particles of the air through which they have passed, and thus increase their heat.</P>
<P>A GREATER number of rays will like∣wise
<PB N="81" REF="024239_0087_0FC572F46C230AB0"/>
strike the earth in that direction, than when they fall obliquely, hence the greater heat in that direction, caeteris paribus.</P>
<P>AIR is observed to be heated to very different degrees in different countries, which are in the same latitude, according as they abound in rough mountains, fertile plains, or sandy desert, as they are surrounded by land or by sea, or according to the different winds which prevail in those countries. The temperature of Pennsylvania is very different from that of Portugal; and that of England is different from that of Saxony, on the neigh∣bouring continent, though they are under the same parallels. In order then, to form a judgment of the climate of any country, we must not only consider the latitude of the place, but also the face and condition of the country, and the winds most prevalent there at the different seasons of the year; if any of these should change, the climate must also be changed more or less, for it is in a great mea∣sure governed by these.</P>
<P>THE surface of a country may be chan∣ged
<PB N="82" REF="024239_0088_0FC56FB39C6AB438"/>
by the arts of human industry in clear∣ing its woods, draining off its waters, and levelling its mountains, (as is exemplified in China) where by these means the air, in ve∣ry unfavourable situations, has been rendered exceedingly wholesome, according to the ac∣counts of the observing Lind.</P>
<P>A TRANSIENT view of the cause of winds will convince us that their course may also be changed.</P>
<P>IT is well known that most winds are occasioned by the heat of the Sun.</P>
<P>WERE the Sun to stand still over any part of the surface of the earth, the wind would constantly blow to that place from all directions: For the air in that part being ra∣rified by the heat of the Sun, would be ex∣panded, and thus become specifically lighter, whence it would ascend, and the heavier air in the neighbouring parts, would rush into its place; this too being heated by the Sun's rays, and by the warm surface of the earth,
<PB N="83" REF="024239_0089_0FC56FB489383EA8"/>
would instantly ascend and give place to that which is colder and more dense.</P>
<P>BUT as the Sun moves, or seems to move between the tropics, from east to west, there would be a constant current of air seting towards the Sun from the N. S. and E. while the current, which would also come from the west, is prevented or turned back by the Sun, which moves with great rapidity in an op∣posite direction. The current, coming from the north and south, falls in with that from the east, and is presently bent in the same direction. This constitutes the <HI>Trade Winds</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the Gulph of Guinea the S. W. wind propels all the clouds, formed by marine exhalations, which float along the south coast of Africa, towards the land, and being compressed by them, against the mountains, it frequently occasions deluges of rain.</P>
<P>The continual easterly trade-wind, likewise, where its im∣petuosity is felt along the eastern coast of America, brings with it the like bad weather. <HI>Muschenbrook.</HI></P></NOTE>, which are found in the Atlantic, and in the great South Sea.</P>
<P>WERE the surface of the earth homo∣geneous—were it all covered with water, or
<PB N="84" REF="024239_0090_0FC56FBA2DCCEE08"/>
all smooth dry land, the easterly winds would always prevail quite round the globe to some distance beyond the tropics. But the waters along the equator are divided by two or three considerable portions of land, which retain the heat in a different manner from the wa∣ter, and reflect the Sun's rays in very differ∣ent proportions, so that they not only stop the easterly current of air, but often change it to the opposite direction. For along the westerly coast of Africa and South America, the winds commonly blow from the west; that is, they blow from a cold <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urface to that which is warmer, from the sea upon the land. In warm countries, or in the warm seasons of any country, the surface of the land is warmer than the surface of the wa∣ter. [But the reverse is the case in cold countries, and in cold seasons of any country, without the tropics.]</P>
<P>The surface of the earth being immove∣ably exposed to the sun, receives and retains the heat, and grows warmer by every addi∣tional ray. The surface of the sea is not soon heated., because the particles which are
<PB N="85" REF="024239_0091_0FC56FBB4D1526D0"/>
uppermost this hour, will presently be over∣whelmed by those that are colder, and these by others in succession.</P>
<P>FROM these trite and general observa∣tions respecting the cause of winds, the rea∣son is obvious, why north west winds prevail during the winter season, in a country lying, as this does, in a direction nearly from the N. E. to the S. W.—The surface of the earth at this season being always colder than that of the sea. To this may be added, that our coast is constantly washed by a current of warm water, which being driven to the west by the easterly trade-winds near the equator, is checked in the gulf of Mexico, and forced to escape to the north eastward to give place to the succeeding current.</P>
<P>LET us now enquire, whether any change of circumstances would reduce the violence of these north west winds, which prevail in Winter.</P>
<P>IT has been proved by experiments, that hard and smooth surfaces, receive, re∣tain,
<PB N="86" REF="024239_0092_0FC56FBD9495D238"/>
and reflect heat, better than those which are soft, rough, or unequal; and a clear, smooth, plain field, especially if sandy and dry, is observed to reflect more heat than one that is covered with trees, bushes, or grass, and more particularly if the soil is moist."—It has also been discovered that a simple solution of water in air always pro∣duces a sensible increase of cold.</P>
<P>FROM these premises established on ex∣periments and observation, it may be ration∣ally concluded, that when in the course of time, this continent becomes populated, cleared, cultivated, improved, and the mois∣ture of the soil exhausted far into the frozen regions of the north, that the bleak winds will become more mild, and the Winters less cold in the middle states, but more especially in those to the southward.</P>
<P>WHAT Philosophy teaches us to expect in the present instance, appears to be confirm∣ed by what has happened in the climate of Italy. The temperature of which, we are
<PB N="87" REF="024239_0093_0FC56FBEF0734A30"/>
assured from unexceptionable authority, is at present much more mild than it was when Virgil wrote his Georgics. This change of climate Dr. Williamson ascribes to the po∣pulation and consequent culture which has gradually taken place in the more northern countries of Europe.</P>
<P>Perhaps it may be apprehended, that if the cultivation, and levelling a country, would mitigate the severity of the Winters, it would increase the <HI>heat</HI> of the Summers in a proportionate degree. But common obser∣vation, as well as the principles of Philoso∣phy, shew that there is no foundation for such apprehension. For during the greatest Summer heats it it found, that the extraor∣dinary heat of the atmosphere does not rise to any considerable height, and in the upper re∣ons it is perpetually cold, both because the air in those regions is too remote from the earth to be warmed by the heat reflected from its surface, and because the air in those higher regions, not being pressed by such a weight of incumbent atmosphere, is too rare to be susceptible of a great degree of heat.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="024239_0094_0FC56FC0735192C0"/>
HENCE it is evident, that nothing is wanting, in the midst of Summer, to render the country agreeably cool, but a proper mix∣ture of the cold air which is above, with the warm air below. This may be effected by any cause which increases the winds, such as showers of rain, thunder gusts, and the cool∣er air of mountains pressing towards more heated parts, to restore the equilibrium, a∣greeable to the established laws of matter and motion.</P>
<P>FROM all the circumstances which have been mentioned, there is no unreasonable prospect (and I am sure it is a very pleasing one), that when this country comes to be di∣versified by vast tracts of clear land, inter∣sected by ridges of rude mountains, the land winds in Summer, to say nothing of those which come from the sea, or from the lakes, charged with moisture, must certainly be much purer and salutary, as well as tempe∣rate and uniform, than they are at present.</P>

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING what has been said in favour of the prospect of a change of cli∣mate for the better in the United States, it must not be concealed, that it has been con∣fidently asserted by gentlemen of extensive geographical knowledge, that no such change has taken place in the climate of China, the capital of which, Pekin, is situated in lati∣tude 39° 54, which is nearly the same de∣gree of latitude, and on the same parallel with Philadelphia, though almost the whole extent of country north of it is cleared, and in a state of the most perfect cultivation.—The greatest cold experienced there in the

<P>WE have incontestable proofs that heat does not altogether depend upon proximity to the equator, but varies at inconsiderable distances, chiefly according to the elevation of the ground, and the current of the winds, as also from the nature of the soil.</P>
<P>UPON these, the temperature of the cli∣mate, the colour, strength and activity, the constitutions and health, of the inhabitants greatly depend. And it is a fact, which ought to be known to every body, that in countries the most noted for sickness and mortality, and in the hottest climates, those who have it in their power to select elevated situations, where the soil is gravelly and dry, may enjoy good health, provided they lead temperate and regular lives, during every

season of the year.—<HI>See</HI> Linds' Essay on Hot Climates.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the observations of Mr. Reinhold Foster, it is not only the clearing of woods, but cultivation and population, that alter the climate of a country, and make it mild and temperate. "The Romans look∣ed upon the winters of Germany and Eng∣land as very severe; but happily both coun∣tries have at present a much more mild cli∣mate than formerly, owing to the three cir∣cumstances above-mentioned.</P>
<P>"NEAR Petersburgh, under 60° N. L. the river Neva, was covered with ice in 1765, in the beginning of December, and cleared of it April 11th, 1766. At Tsaritsin, which is under 48° 40. N. L. the river Volga was covered with ice the 26th of November, 1765, and the ice broke in the river, April 27th, 1766 (all old stile). Is it not almost incredible, that in a place almost 12 de∣grees nearer to the south, the effects of cold should be felt longer and more severely than
<PB N="92" REF="024239_0098_0FC56FCD42036568"/>
in the more northern climate? And though the neighbourhood of Petersburgh has a great many woods, the cold was, however, less severe and lasting: Tsaritsin, on the con∣trary, has no woods for many hundred miles in its neighbourhood, if we except some few trees and bushes along the Volga and its isles, and the low land along it; wherever the eye looks to the east, there are vast plains without woods, for many hundred miles.</P>
<P>THE clearing a country of woods cannot, therefore, alone contribute so much to make the climate milder, but cultivation does more. In an hundred square miles near Tsaritsin, there is not so much cultivated land as there is within ten miles of Petersburgh; it is in proportion to the number of the inhabitants of both places, and this makes the chief dif∣ference of the climate. There is still another consideration; Petersburgh lies near the sea, and Tsaritsin in an inland country, and, ge∣nerally speaking, countries near the sea have been observed to enjoy a milder climate. These few remarks will be, I believe, suf∣ficient
<PB N="93" REF="024239_0099_0FC56FCEB2025A58"/>
to enable every body to judge of the changes of the climate in various countries, which, no doubt, grow warmer and more temperate as cultivation and population in∣crease.</P>
<P>MR. Kalm (in Vol. II. p. 249) says, the corn near Quebec, in Canada, formerly was never ripe till the 15th or 16th of Septem∣ber; but that for some years previous to the year 1749, the harvest began in the last week of August (old stile).—The inhabitants also informed him, that formerly the corn never ripened; but since the woods have been suf∣ficiently cleared, the beams of the sun have had more room to operate, and it ripens perfectly.</P>
<P>"SOME parts of Italy bear melancholy proofs of the alterations that accidental causes make on the atmosphere; for the Campagna di Roma, where the ancient Romans enjoyed as salubrious air as is to be found on any part of the globe, is now almost pestilential, through the decrease of inhabitants, which has occasioned a stagnation of waters and putrid exhalations."</P>

<HEAD>Of the DISEASES of PENNSYLVANIA.</HEAD>
<P>DAILY observations convince us, that the diseases which occur in this state, are not very numerous or complicated, except in the city, where the greatest part of the in∣habitants are employed in sedentary occu∣pations.</P>
<P>THE diseases which occur in the country are generally of an inflammatory nature, and are most frequent the latter end of Autumn, and in the early part of Spring; these are often occasioned by unavoidable or imprudent ex∣posure to cold and rainy weather, and by the neglect of changing wet and damp clothes for dry and warm ones; but more commonly by the neglect of putting on a Winter dress as soon as frosty weather begins in Autumn, and by the imprudent practice of changing warm and thick cloathing for a thinner and cooler dress too early in the spring: Even in the low and marshy situations, the richer inhabi∣tants, who have dry apartments, and who
<PB N="95" REF="024239_0101_0FC56FD2AD6AA1F8"/>
live on substantial diet during the autumnal season, when Intermitting and Remitting Fe∣vers are epidemic, are much less liable to be affected by the poisonous effluvia of the pu∣trid soil than the poorer class, who are more exposed, and obliged to live abstemiously, and to go thinly clad. The poorer class of people, who reside in the towns and large vil∣lages (though labouring under all the disad∣vantages of indigence) where the impurities with which the atmosphere is charged, in consequence of the action of heat upon a moist soil, and the extrication of fixed air from decaying and putrid vegetables, is cor∣rected by numerous fires, and ventilation is favoured by the arrangement of the houses into streets, are less subject to the disorders in question, than those who live in detached houses, or in the suburbs, where that advan∣tage is wanting.</P>
<P>THE great and sudden changes which so frequently happen in the state of the weather, both in Summer and Winter, may be con∣sidered as the principal causes of the diseases

The only case which ever came under my care, that was not occasioned by external injury, was occasioned by exposure to a N.

<P>SOME one or more contagious disease, be∣ing always more or less prevalent in the city, is one reason why a greater proportion of children die annually in the city than in the country.</P>
<P>THE Influenza, or contagious Catarrh, has been epidemic in America three differ∣ent times. The first time of its appearance that I can find recorded, was in the Autumn of 1733; previous to which it had spread over every country in Europe, beginning in the North of Germany. From Europe it ap∣pears to have been imported into America. It was again observed, and recorded particu∣larly by Dr. Thomas Bond, in 1761. At that time its progress was traced from the West India islands to Halifax in Nova-Sco∣tia, where it appeared in the Spring; from thence it reached Boston, and the neighbour∣ing states, and afterwards spread in a most
<PB N="101" REF="024239_0107_0FC56FE1879BF7B0"/>
rapid manner over the whole continent of North America, without being retarded in its progress by any alteration in the sensible qualities of the atmosphere or the course of the winds, till the month of July, after which it was no more heard of.</P>
<P>THIS disease made its appearance a third time in America, in 1789. It was first obser∣ved at New-York, in September, from whence it spread, in the course of six or eight weeks, over every part of the union, and pas∣sed to several of the West-India Islands; but whether it proceeded to the Spanish settle∣ments in South America, or whether the Aborigines of North America were affected by it, I have not been able to learn. Per∣sons of all ages and descriptions were affected by it in Philadelphia; and its contagious ef∣fects were so uncommonly rapid, that many supposed its cause was blended with, or sus∣pended in the atmosphere, and conveyed by the winds; but the analogy of every other species of contagion contradicts this suppo∣sition. Its continuance in Philadelphia was
<PB N="102" REF="024239_0108_0FC56FE2EF171590"/>
about six weeks: how it was generated, or from whence it was derived, I have not been able to inform myself. The origin of this disease appears to be as obscure as that of the Small Pox or Measles. The first account of its appearance in Europe, upon record, was in the year 1557, at which time its progress was traced from Asia to Constantinople, &amp;c. The symptoms in general resembled the com∣mon Catarrh from taking cold; but it differed from it materially in being attended, in most cases, with a considerable prostration of strength, and impaired vigour in all the func∣tions of the body.</P>
<P>I WAS always guided in my practice by the symptoms present, and do not recollect a case that did not do well: The symptoms were so mild with multitudes, that they re∣quired no medicinal aid. In general, mild Antimonials, and the Antiphlogistic Regi∣men, were found serviceable; and when the inflammatory symptoms subsided, Opium afforded relief to the Cough.</P>

<P>"FROM the most successful enquiries I have been able to make, I have found that the Influenza prevailed in this coun∣try in the year 1733. It was again epidemic in the year 1749. This last information I received <HI>indirectly</HI> from the late Dr. Barnet of Elizabeth Town; who added, that the universal re∣medy for it among the common people, was a drink composed of a jill of vinegar, a pint of water, and two table spoonfulls of melasses. It appeared again in the spring of the year 1761, and was both violent and universal. I recollect all its symp∣toms perfectly, it being the first year I began the study of medicine. It was distinguished by the name of "this Cold," and "the great Cold." Dr. Gilchrist, takes notice of it in the Physical and Literary Essays of Edinburgh. Notwithstand∣ing this epidemic was so universal as to check business in ma∣ny places, and to exclude all other subjects of conversation, yet I was lately surprized to find only three of the citizens of Philadelphia, who had retained a distinct recollection of it.

<P>"THE Influenza made its next appearance in the Winter, 1770-1; an account of which I have preserved in my note∣book, and have found it to agree exactly with the histories of the Influenza in this and other countries. I need not mention to you its appearance in the Autumn of 1789. My inquiries and observations satisfy me, that it appeared again in the Spring of 1790, and in the Winter of 1790-1. I shall not trouble you with a detail of the facts upon which I ground this assertion, as I have prepared a full account of them to be laid before the public in a 2d vol. of Medical Enquiries, which I am now preparing for the press."</P></NOTE>.</P>

THE Hydrophobia is so rare an occurence here that I have never seen a case of it. Dr. Rush and Dr. Percival have, in my opinion, thrown more light on the nature of this dis∣ease than any other writers.</P>
<P>THE accounts which have been published respecting the fascinating power of Snakes in this country, have originated in ignorance and credulity, and are entirely groundless; as well as those tales which are often told of their breeding in the livers of Dogs which have been bitten by them.</P>
<P>THE experiments of the industrious and ingenious Fontana, of Tuscany, furnish am∣ple proof, that the bite of the Viper is sel∣dom
<PB N="105" REF="024239_0111_0FC56FEE1BA1DA40"/>
fatal to men, or the larger class of ani∣mals, though it instantly kills small ones: hence a presumption arises, that the remedies employed by the Indians owe their credit to ignorance of this circumstance. According to the last quoted writer, the immediate ap∣plication of Lunar Caustic, to a part bitten by a Snake, prevents it from having any ill effect: This produces an eschar, and a con∣siderable wound, which is afterwards to be dressed with common Cerate.</P>
<P>FEWER diseases prevail in Autumn, when the ground is frequently refreshed by show∣ers, and the ponds are replenished with wa∣ter, than in dry ones. This circumstance is thus explained by Dr. Rush<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It is remarked by Dr. Percival, "that wet seasons are generally more free from epidemic diseases, than dry ones. And that those years are most unfavourable to health, in which heavy rains fall about the beginning of Summer, and are suc∣ceeded by great and uninterrupted hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. For the earth being thus drenched with moisture, and the low lands overflowed with water, the exhalations become constant, copious, and of∣ten putrid."</P>
<P>"JOAN LEO, in his history of Africa relates, that if heavy rains fall in that country, during the months of July and Au∣gust, the Plague usually breaks out the September following. But in European climates, it is well remarked by Sir John Pringle, that frequent showers in Summer, cool the air, check the excess of vapour, dilute and refresh the corrupted waters, and precipitate the noxious effluvia, which float in the atmos∣phere." Percival's Essays, 4th Edition, vol. 2d. p. 22.</P></NOTE> "While the creeks and rivers are confined within steady
<PB N="106" REF="024239_0112_0FC56FEF0FCBAF98"/>
bounds, there is little or no exhalation of fe∣brile miasmata from their shores." "The dry Summers of 1780, 1781 and 1782, by reducing the rivers and creeks, far below their ancient marks, while the wet Spring of 1784 and 1785, by swelling them beyond their na∣tural heights, have when they have fallen, left a large and extensive surface of moist ground, exposed to the action of the sun, and of course to the generation and exhalation of febrile miasmata."</P>
<P>As tables of Meteorological Observations will be annexed, which will shew the varia∣bleness and vicissitudes to which the weather is liable in this climate, I shall add nothing farther on the subject here; but shall now proceed to give an account of the diseases to
<PB N="107" REF="024239_0113_0FC56FF2C60A10F8"/>
which the inhabitants of Philadelphia are more particularly liable.</P>
<P>THE diseases to which the opulent and fashionable class of the men; are most sub∣ject are these, viz. Apoplexy, Palsey, Epi∣lepsy, Dyspepsia, Jaundice, Gout, Asthma, Hypochondria, Dropsy, &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE ladies are most subject to the follow∣ing, viz. Head-ach, <HI>accompanied with sick∣ness at stomach,</HI> Spasmodic, Asthma, Hys∣teria, Dyspepsia, Hypochondria, Catarrh, Hemoptysis, Phthisis Pulmonalis, Colic, Menorrhagia, Abortion, Sterility, Melancho∣lia, Chronic weaknesses, &amp;c.</P>
<P>DAILY observation teaches us, that the generality of the diseases just mentioned, to which men of fashion and opulence are most subject, proceed from excessive indulgence in the pleasures of the table, and in drinking wine and other liquors to excess, joined to the want of proper exercise—dosing away the salutary hours of the morning in bed; re∣spiring
<PB N="108" REF="024239_0114_0FC56FF46C762038"/>
the confined air of a chamber; and to discontent of mind for want of some in∣teresting pursuit.</P>
<P>By the joint effects of intemperance and indolence, the digestion sooner or later never fails of being impaired. And as on the due performance of digestion, much of our health, ease, and prospect of longevity de∣pends, we ought most studiously to avoid every thing that has a probable chance of in∣terrupting it.</P>
<P>THE quality of Aliment most wholesome, may generally be determined by the experi∣ence of each individual: The principal in∣convenience arises from quantity.</P>
<P>THE judicious Dr. Fothergill observes, that "the Author of Nature, has so form∣ed and constructed the organs of digestion, that we can gradually accommodate our∣selves to every species of Aliment. A great part of the eastern world, subsists principally upon rice and other vegetables: many coun∣tries
<PB N="109" REF="024239_0115_0FC56FFDFB196500"/>
live almost solely on fish; others on a mixed diet of animal and vegetable sub∣stances, without suffering injury."</P>
<P>No kind of food hurts us, if gradually ac∣customed to it; but this is not the case in re∣gard to quantity. From errors in this, in a great measure, proceed the formidable proge∣ny which have already been enumerated.</P>
<P>"IN a weak stomach, a large proportion of bread is indigestible; it turns four, produces Heart-burn, Flatulencies, Spasmodic pains, &amp;c. Valetudinarians should therefore always use it with moderation."</P>
<P>IN Philadelphia animal food, of one kind or other, constitutes the chief part of our nourishment.</P>
<P>THAT there are some kinds of more easy, some of harder digestion than others, is well known to every body. The most difficult of these, will be digested without occasioning much disturbance, if taken in small quanti∣ties;
<PB N="110" REF="024239_0116_0FC56FFF72D50FC0"/>
but if a person eats as much of ham, salted beef or bacon, as he ought to do of fresh fish or chicken, he may, and generally will, suffer by it.</P>
<P>AFTER a plentiful dinner of animal food, it is now the custom here, to introduce deserts of rich Sweet-Meats, Custards, Jellies, and Fruits, and of various kinds; all of which at such time is unnatural and improper, because of the extraordinary stimulus such a load of heterogeneous substances must give to the fi∣bres of the stomach, both in a mechanical and chemical sense. "By these means fresh labour is added to a tired digestion." The rule where fashion cannot altogether be dis∣pensed with, is carefully to observe, that the sum of all together, does not exceed due bounds, or encroach upon the first feelings of satiety.</P>
<P>WITH respect to strong liquors, the less in quantity, when in good health, the more consistent with the preservation of health and long life. The safest and most natural
<PB N="111" REF="024239_0117_0FC57001147B6C68"/>
practice is to drink as much wine and water, or any other agreeable fermented liquor, dur∣the repast, as thirst or inclination may re∣quire, and then to dismiss the bottle entire∣ly; after which a dish of strong coffee may be introduced with propriety.</P>
<P>"THE sick Head-ach, as it is called, is generally the consequence of an indigested meal, frequently of a heavy supper; and for the cure, requires the occasional use of mild Pukes, laxatives of Rubarb with Columbo∣root, and a strict attention to regimen and daily exercise in the open air in seasonable weather."</P>
<P>THE diseases to which the women of fa∣shion are most subject, in general, proceed from the opposite extreme: From too great abstemiousness in meats of a nutritive quali∣ty; from wine, but especially from the want of exercise, while they indulge too much in regaling themselves with strong infusions of palatable, but noxious, Tea.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="024239_0118_0FC57004E6658378"/>
A CONSIDERABLE number of their com∣plaints also, proceed from the frequent changes of dress, and the alternate vicissi∣tudes from heat to cold, to which fashion, and the love of pleasure, expose them. There are instances of young ladies in this city, who, for the sake of an elegant and admired shape, apply a leather bandage, dipt in wa∣ter, round their waists every night when go∣ing to bed, which contracts as it becomes dry. The pernicious effects of this experi∣ment must be evident to every person of common sense. They are also often injured by confined air.</P>
<P>"THE plant in the green house, the Sheep in the cot, and the most admired Beauty be∣neath her gilded roof," are equally injured by confined air.</P>
<P>FROM the best information which I have been able to obtain, more than one-fifth of all the children born in this city, die under two years of age—A considerable portion of these, fall victims to the contagious diseases
<PB N="113" REF="024239_0119_0FC57006330F4A00"/>
which never cease to prevail; but the greatest part die of Cholera, Diarrhaea, and Remitting Fever."</P>
<P>MECHANICS who follow sedentary occu∣pations, are particularly subject to Dyspep∣sia, Colic, Costiveness, Haemorrhoids, Hy∣pochondria, OEdema, Pain in the Thorax, Phthisis, Scurvy, Itch, Gravel.</P>
<P>"OF all the causes which conspire to ren∣der life short and miserable, none has greater influence than the want of proper exercise."</P>
<P>WHOEVER examines the structure and functions of the human body, must be con∣vinced of this.</P>
<P>"THE Body is composed of an infinite number of vessels, whose Fluids cannot be pushed on, without the action and pressure of the Muscles; but if the Muscles remain in∣active, the Fluids will stagnate, and obstruc∣tions will be formed, which cannot fail to oc∣casion diseases. Both the sanguiferous vessels
<PB N="114" REF="024239_0120_0FC5700D32F9DDA0"/>
and the Lymphatics, are furnished with nu∣merous Valves for the purpose of preventing the retrograde motion of their contents; but without the assistance of the Muscles, this admirable contrivance is of little use."</P>
<P>THIS part of the animal oeconomy proves to a demonstration, the necessity of exercise for the preservation of health.</P>
<P>"WHEN confined and unwholesome air is added to the want of exercise, diseases must be the consequence."</P>
<P>IT is owing to the combination of these two circumstances, that so many of the children of the poorer sort of the inhabitants of this city die annually.</P>
<P>THE exercise of walking is preferable to any other mode, for those who are not great∣ly debilitated or infirm; because a greater number of Muscles are thereby put in action than by any other.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="024239_0121_0FC5700E89D68248"/>
THOSE who are confined to sedentary em∣ployments, should therefore devote a certain portion of their time, to taking a walk every day a few squares in the open air, and em∣ploy one afternoon of every week in some active diversion.</P>
<P>A NUMBER of tradesmen are often crowd∣ed together in the same small apartment; this is particularly the case with Weavers, Taylors, Shoemakers, &amp;c. In this situa∣tion they generally continue for many hours at a time, often with the addition of several candles burning, whereby the air becomes charged with the Phlogiston issuing from them, as well as from the Lungs, which ren∣ders it unfit for expanding the Lungs suf∣ficiently, and of supplying the blood with the matter of heat. <HI>See</HI> Priestley's Philosophi∣cal Experiments; Crawford, on Heat; and Goodwin on Respiration.</P>
<P>MANY Artists are liable to diseases, in consequence of their particular occupations. Chemists, Brass-founders, workers in the
<PB N="116" REF="024239_0122_0FC57016177B6210"/>
various Minerals and Metals, Painters, Prin∣ters, &amp;c. owing to the noxious effluvia (in∣separable from those occupations) being re∣ceived into the system, by the Lungs or Stomach.</P>
<P>"THE Scholar, the Philosopher, and the Statesman, who devote almost the whole of their time to study and reflexion, seldom fail to impair their constitutions, or of becoming Valetudinarians."</P>
<P>"AND many young ladies, who regard∣less of exercise, customary meals, or necessary repose, are perpetually employed in reading Love-inspiring Novels, not only impair their constitutions, but pervert their imagi∣nations, and corrupt their morals to such a degree, that they are ever after rendered unfit for the offices of domestic life, and unquali∣fied to promote domestic felicity."</P>
<P>"THE constant confinement of children within doors, and at School in crowds, proves destructive to the lives of multitudes, and
<PB N="117" REF="024239_0123_0FC5701A5BF3C300"/>
never fails to render the constitutions of those whom it does not destroy, delicate and in∣firm."</P>
<P>"To be shut up several hours in the day in a School, as soon as a child can speak intel∣ligibly; secluded from the benefit of exercise, and the refreshment of the open air, and compelled to learn what he cannot compre∣hend, is not only cruel, but inhuman." <HI>See</HI> Dr. Gregories Essays.</P>
<P>AMONG the very poorest sort of people in the city, are sometimes engendered Fevers of the most contagious and malignant nature, as well as the most loathsome cutaneous dis∣eases. These proceed from want of proper food and raiment, and from living in close, confined, and dirty apartments; in Garrets, Cellars, &amp;c.—destitute of the common ne∣cessaries of life, in a vitiated atmosphere.</P>
<P>"IT is remarkable, that not only the hu∣man species, but Cattle also, which have been
<PB N="118" REF="024239_0124_0FC5701DE0E43250"/>
kept upon too scanty an allowance of pro∣vision, or on that which is of a bad quality, are generally afflicted with diseases of the skin, which seldom fail to disappear when plentifully supplied with that which is wholesome, and more nourishing."</P>
<P>"THE diseases to which Labourers and Mechanics, who are employed in laborious occupations, are most subject, are, for the most part, very different from the foregoing: To these, the Erysipelas is very incident: This is occasioned by whatever gives a sud∣den check to the perspiration, after the heat of the body has been considerably augmented by exercise or any other cause; by the drink∣ing of cold water, wet feet, keeping on wet cloaths, sitting or lying on the damp ground, or exposing the body to a current of air while in a state of increased perspiration."</P>
<P>PEOPLE who reside in the country, are often injured by handling a small tree, grow∣ing in m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ist swampy grounds, called by Linnaeus Rhus Vernix, or poison Sumac, and
<PB N="119" REF="024239_0125_0FC5701F057629B0"/>
by a small creeping Vine, resembling the Ivy, called Rhus Radicans, or Poison Vine. These like the juice of the West-India Cashu Nut, raise numerous minute Vessications over the surface of the skin, and cause considerable tumors of the parts affected. The vessica∣tions contain a thin transparent serum; they frequently ulcerate and become purulent.—The cure consists in washing the parts, not ulcerated, with weak Lead-water, or com∣mon Cold-water, and in dressing the ulcerat∣ed parts with Goulard's or Turner's Cerate.</P>
<P>THIS class of people are very apt to be affected with Vomitting and Purging, Bilious Colic, &amp;c.—From eating heavy four bread, vegetables of difficult digestion, and drink∣ing weak stale small-beer, or the like.</P>
<P>"SUCH as have to lift or carry heavy burdens, as Porters, Labourers, Carpenters, Shipwrights, &amp;c. are very subject to <HI>Her∣nias,</HI> and to spitting of blood," &amp;c.</P>
<P>"THIS last is owing to the vessels of the
<PB N="120" REF="024239_0126_0FC57021E13EDD40"/>
Lungs being over distended, from their be∣ing obliged to draw in the air with much greater force, and also to keep their Lungs more distended than is necessary for com∣mon respiration."</P>
<P>THE following is a copy of a letter from Dr. B. Rush, dated January 19th, 1791.</P>
<Q><P>THE slow Nervous Fever, as described by Dr. Huxham, was a very common disease in Philadelphia, during my apprenticeship, (from the year 1760 to 1766) also for many years after, I settled in the city, which was in the year 1769.</P>
<P>THE late Dr. Thomas Cadwallader, who died in the year 1779, in the 71st year of his age, informed me, that he remembered the time when that species of Fever made its first appearance among our citizens, and that it had gradually travelled here from Connec∣ticut, where it was known by the name of the <HI>Long Fever.</HI> It was very common during
<PB N="121" REF="024239_0127_0FC57022CF8E1DE0"/>
the late war, and appeared to be kept up by the intercourse of our city with the American Hospitals and British Prison Ships. During the last seven years it has gradually disap∣peared. In the course of the three last years. I have seen but few cases of it. It was very remarkable, that it never made its appearance in our city until the weather became cool. I have suspected from this circumstance, that it always had a portion of inflammatory, or what Dr. Cullen calls Synochoid Diathesis, mixed with it.</P>
<P>IN July, the exciting causes of Fever seem to produce Cholera Morbus; in August and September, Remitting Fevers, with bili∣ous discharges; and in October and Novem∣ber, the slow Nervous Fever, of Dr. Hux∣ham.</P>
<P>THE disappearance of this Fever is proba∣bly owing to the greater attention which has been paid latterly to cleanliness and fresh air, by all classes of people, both in sickness and
<PB N="122" REF="024239_0128_0FC5702436CEAB90"/>
health<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THE <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of people <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> supplied with cloathing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> than they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> before the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE>. The remote cause of this Fever, I have suposed to be <HI>Contagion,</HI> either from a diseased body, or from a morbid matter ge∣nerated in the extremities of the arteries from low diet, the want of cleanliness, and above all from that languor which is induced upon the circulation, by grief, or any other sedative passion of the mind. I think too I have seen this Fever where it evidently arose from a neglected or ill-treated inflammatory Fever, in which neither of the above causes has operated. In this case it has occured in the Winter and Spring. In the latter season, I have seen it succeed Pleurisy, and accom∣panied through all its duration by the same kind of troublesome Cough, which occurs in the last stage of that disease, when it arises from other causes.</P></Q>
<P>MANY cases have come under the author's notice of persons of an infirm habit falling into the slow Nervous Fever, or Typhus Mi∣tior,
<PB N="123" REF="024239_0129_0FC57025F2EDC3F8"/>
after having been debilitated more than common by fatigue and grief, without being exposed to contagion, but only in conse∣quence of a sudden check of perspiration. Hence it appears that the same remote cause produces a different form of disease, according to the difference of constitution on which it operates.</P>
<P>THE combined debilitating effects of fa∣tigue and grief are very common causes of this Fever, in persons of relaxed and infirm Constitutions, and it appears to depend intire∣ly upon a diminution of nervous energy, but is most commonly the effect of infectious efflu∣via. <HI>See</HI> Dr. Hunter's opinion respecting the effects of vitiated air in producing Nervous Fever, in the London Medical Transac∣tions.</P>
<P>THE Pulmonary Consumption appears to be the most frequent, as well as the most fatal of the Chronic Diseases which occur in Phila∣delphia. The greatest proportion of those who die of this malady, from the most ac∣curate
<PB N="124" REF="024239_0130_0FC57028AD826018"/>
observations which I have been able to make, belong to the society of the Friends; and of these, the number is nearly in the proportion of three females to one male.</P>
<P>PERHAPS the want of vivacity in the peo∣ple of this society, and the sedentary lives of their females, are the principal causes of this difference; these certainly in some measure counter-balance the advantages which they enjoy from their superior cleanliness, neat∣ness, and sobriety.</P>
<P>THE late judicious and experienced Dr. Fothergill, in my opinion, has given the best directions for the successful treatment of the Pulmonary Consumption of any author that has written on the subject. <HI>See</HI> his Works in Quarto, published by J. Cokely Lettsom, M. D.</P>
<P>THE method of treating this complaint by the daily exhibition of Pukes, as recom∣mended by Dr. Reid, is in general a very injudicious and pernicious one. The one
<PB N="125" REF="024239_0131_0FC57029709ECAE8"/>
recommended by the late Dr. Brown, is still more exceptionable.</P>
<P>THE improvements proposed by Dr. Rush, I have never had an opportunity of seeing put in practice; but have had con∣siderable experience of the good effects pro∣duced by observing the method recommend∣ed by Dr. Fothergill, particularly in the in∣cipient stage of the disease. When the dis∣ease is contracted in a northern climate, the patient should always pass his Winters, if possible, in a climate within the tropics.</P>

<P>VARIOUS kinds of inflammatory diseases, and also the Measles and Hooping Cough, occurred very frequently this month.

VERY few diseases prevailed this month; but in the same month of the year 1791, in∣flammatory diseases were very frequent; especially Rheumatism, Cynanche Tonsil∣laris, or inflammatory Quinsy, and Pleurisy; several were affected with Cholera and Di∣arrhea, in consequence of a sudden change from hot to cold weather, which took place the latter end of this month; the wind hav∣ing shifted suddenly from the South to the N.

<P>DISEASES.</P>
<P>DIARRHAEAS and Choleras were epi∣demic the latter end of this month, especially among children. This is the case about the same time every year, according as the ex∣treme heats set in sooner or later.</P>
<P>THE Cholera generally came on in the
<PB N="133" REF="024239_0139_0FC5704175F8BDF0"/>
night time, or after a change from very hot to considerably cooler weather, whereby a sudden check was given to the perspiration, and the nervous system amazingly debili∣tated.</P>
<P>A FEW drops of Laudanum, in a Pepper∣mint or Cinnamon Julep, frequently repeat∣ed; spirituous fomentations to the abdomen, applied very warm, and the application of heated Flannels to the extremities, scarce ever failed of curing the Cholera; having first favored the evacuation of the bilious matter from the stomach, by frequent draughts of Camomile Tea, or Coffee made of toasted Oatmeal.</P>
<P>THE Diarrhaea (if indubitable signs of laxity and debility are present) can only be cured by tonics, spirituous drinks, warm cloathing, cleanliness, pure air, and moder∣ate exercise, with the occasional use of Lau∣danum, in very small but frequent doses, and a regimen of very easy digestion, and of an Alkaline quality.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="024239_0140_0FC5704307650D18"/>
A STRONG decoction of Peruvian Bark, with the addition of a little powder of Galls and Cinnamon, given in small draughts re∣peatedly in the day time, and a small dose of Paregoric Elixir at night, has succeeded in numerous cases after stronger astringents, Aromatics and Absorbents, had failed.</P>
<P>A decoction of Rice, Cinnamon, and a lit∣tle Chalk makes a very suitable drink.</P>
<P>WHEN a child has a Fever or a Diarrhaea, the complaint is generally ascribed to worms, even by those who ought to know better. The sufferer is therefore compelled to take something to destroy Worms, when nine times in ten none exist; or if they do, they are by no means the cause of Fever, at least they are never the direct or exciting cause. It is true they may irritate persons of ex∣quisitely sensible and weak Nerves, sufficient∣ly to induce a Spasm of the bowels and oc∣casion Diarrhaea, Colic, and even convulsions; but it is impossible for them to produce a genuine Fever.</P>

DISEASES.</P>
<P>THE acute diseases which occurred this month, were nearly similar to those of the preceding one. In addition to these, the Dysentery became very frequent towards the latter end of the month, at which time the dews were very heavy and chilling.</P>
<P>THE following method of treating the Dysentery, scarce ever failed of success.</P>
<P>AFTER the patient's stomach was cleared out by a mild Puke, and his bowels by a full dose of Glauber's Salts; he took a paper of the following powder, in a draught of agreeable beverage, every three hours, or if much griped and troubled constantly with Tenesmus, every two hours.</P>

<P>THIS was continued every day in the same manner, as long as the griping or tor∣mina
<PB N="137" REF="024239_0143_0FC57049D9C47368"/>
of the bowels and scanty mucous stools continued, and afterwards occasionally if the morbid symptoms returned.</P>
<P>WHERE this medicine caused griping, the Tart. Emet. was omitted, and the powder given without it.</P>
<P>WHEN it become very disagreeable to the patient, Castor Oil, or Cream Tart. with a small quantity of Tart. Emet. was sub∣stituted.</P>
<P>FROM one to two grains of Opium, or a proportionable quantity of Laudanum, was also given to an adult every night, from the time of taking the first purge till cured.</P>
<P>WHEN the patient's strength was not greatly impaired, he was confined to mild cooling drinks, acidulated with Lemon Juice, or syrup of Tamarinds; and his diet was Spoon Meats without Wine or Spices, and all the ripe and juicy Fruits of the season. Sweet Milk and Butter Milk were also allow∣ed
<PB N="138" REF="024239_0144_0FC5704B3A3AA978"/>
but when the strength was considerably impaired, Wine-Whey, and Sangree were allowed for common drink, and Panada or Tapioca, with Wine and Nutmeg, for food, &amp;c.</P>
<P>WHEN the griping was very distressing, and the rectum appeared excoriated, Glisters of Barley Water and Gum Arabic were oc∣casionally injected, to which were frequently added a few drops of Laudanum. The Ab∣domen was also sometimes fomented with Flannels, wrung out of a bitter decoction, as hot as could be borne, and afterwards rub∣bed with warm Laudanum, and spirits of Camphor, or Camphorated Oil and Lau∣danum.</P>
<P>As soon as the griping was removed, a decoction of Cortex Peruv. with eight or ten drops of Elixir Vitrioli, was administered four or five times a day, a more liberal use of Wine directed, and an Anodyne continued at night. To prevent a relapse, exercise, and
<PB N="139" REF="024239_0145_0FC5704CB96B14D8"/>
a Flannel Vest, &amp;c. with other warm cloath∣ing, were recommended.</P>
<P>THIS, and this alone, is the only certain and successful method of treating the Dysen∣tery, when it is an Idiopathic disease. I never saw a case where Blisters were of any real service, except when the disease was on∣ly symptomatic, or combined with the Inter∣mitting or Remitting Fever, which is seldom or never the case in Philadelphia.</P>
<P>THE method of treating this disease by diffusible stimulants and a cordial diet, re∣commended by the late Dr. Brown, and by the sweating process, recommended by Dr. Mosely, in his Treatise on Tropical Diseases, I have seen prove injurious in several in∣stances, and believe they can seldom or ever succeed.</P>
<P>Two cases of Peripneumony came under my observation this month. The one was a man 56 years of age; he was attacked with the disease, a short time after leaving off a
<PB N="140" REF="024239_0146_0FC570510B108500"/>
Flannel Shirt, which he had worn all the pre∣ceding season. The other was a delicate woman, the mother of several children, who appeared much disposed to Phthisis Pulmo∣nalis. The disease was occasioned with her, by sitting a considerable time in a cool Spring-House, when much heated and fa∣tigued.</P>
<P>THE man died, owing, I believe, to the delay of his friends in making application for his relief. His Thorax was opened, and an abscess discovered in the right Lobe of the Lungs, and marks of Gangrene in the Pleura, in consequence of the high inflam∣mation with which it had been affected early in the disease.</P>
<P>THE woman was blooded four times, by which she lost 36 ounces of blood-was put upon the Antiphlogistic Regimen, purged moderately for two or three days with Salts and Tartar Emetic; and after the second bleeding, had a large Blister Plaster applied over the affected part.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="024239_0147_0FC5705701C896B8"/>
IN every case of Pleurisy, the patient should be blooded every day, more or less, according to the violence of the Pain, Fever and strength of the Pulse, and where those symptoms are very violent, twice a-day (without regard to the state of the expecto∣ration), as well as freely purged, till the Fever, Pain and fulness of the Pulse be all considerably reduced. The patient should at the same time strictly observe the Anti∣phlogistic Regimen—Have his chamber con∣stantly refreshed with cooler air than would be agreeable in time of health, if the season will admit, and not be oppressed with bed∣cloaths—His bed and body linen daily shift∣ed—All his drinks should be taken about the temperature of Spring Water, or at most not warmer than a Toast will make it.</P>
<P>BLISTERING is always found most ser∣viceable after copious bleeding.</P>
<P>When the Pulse is reduced, the Pain and Dyspnea abated, and the Fever moderate, one of the following Powders, taken in
<PB N="142" REF="024239_0148_0FC57058B875DB80"/>
Barley Water or Flaxseed Tea, acidulated with Lime Juice, and repeated every two or three hours, generally finishes the cure.</P>

<P>IN cases where the Pulse sinks, and con∣siderable prostration of strength comes on, instead of the above Powders and the cooling drinks, a few grains of Volatile Alkali and Wine-Whey, or heating Aromatic Teas should be substituted; and Blisters applied to different parts of the body.</P>

"THIS month was dry and cool; the mornings generally foggy. The dews which fell in the evenings and during the night, were very copious, and in a great measure made up for the deficiency of rain."</P>
<P>THE frequent changes in the temperature of the air, particularly from extreme heat to extraordinary cold, gave rise to a great va∣riety of diseases of a very different nature; but the usual epidemic of the season, the Bilious Remitting Fever, as it is called, was by far the most common.</P>
<P>I SHALL here take the opportunity of giving a description of the symptoms of this disease, and of making public the remedies and method of treatment which I have found most certain and successful.</P>
<P>THE Bilious Remitting Fever, which is more or less epidemic at Philadelphia every year in Autumn, begins with a sense of general debility; weariness, and pain in the back and loins; giddiness of the head, loss
<PB N="144" REF="024239_0150_0FC5705D351923C0"/>
of appetite; inclination to Puke; chilliness, succeeded by flushes of heat; distention of Stomach; some perceptible uneasiness in respiration; quick small irregular Pulse.</P>
<P>THESE symptoms generally continue three or four days, and sometimes longer, before the patient is confined to bed. After that, the Feverish symptoms become considerable in the afternoon, but always remit more or less before morning. With the remission, the skin, which during the Paroxism was dry and hot, becomes moist and cooler; but still some quickness and irregularity continue in the Pulse, some Thirst, and other slight symptoms of Fever.</P>
<P>THE Paroxism returns commonly about noon or soon after, without any chill or shaking, but is often preceded with a disa∣greeable and distressing sense of cold and anxiety about the Precordia, which gradually subside when the Paroxism is completely formed. While the Paroxism is forming, a distressing and violent puking often comes
<PB N="145" REF="024239_0151_0FC5705EAED15618"/>
on, and sometimes a very weakening Diar∣rhaea. The matter evacuated is commonly mixed with bile, and is sometimes very green and corrosive.</P>
<P>THE Tongue is covered from the begin∣ing with a whitish mucus, which in the course of the disease, if the symptoms of general debility continue to increase, and the remissions become more indistinct, as is of∣ten the case, becomes dry and hard, and of a dark brown colour—a dark coloured sordes also gathers about the teeth and gums.</P>
<P>IN this manner the Fever generally conti∣nues, with an increase of the symptoms in the afternoon and great part of the night, with a remission or abatement of the same in the morning, till in a longer or shorter period, it ends either in complete and dis∣tinct intermissions, or degenerates into a continued form.</P>
<P>WHEN it degenerates into the continued form, it resembles the Typhus or Putrid Fe∣ver

in all its symptoms, but differs from it essentially in not being contagious.</P>
<P>MANY Physicians from having observed the extraordinary quantity of bile discharg∣ed by patients with this Fever, have been led into a notion that a depraved state of this fluid is the cause of the Fever—But by whatever means vomiting is excited, if of∣ten repeated with violent strainings, it has a powerful effect in emulging and emptying the biliary ducts, and commonly forces out a great deal of bile. This will necessarily be the case in Remitting and Intermitting Fe∣vers; for in consequence of the debility in∣duced by the remote causes (which are sup∣posed to be Marsh Miasmata, and a long continued course of great heat), especially during the cold or forming stage of these Fe∣vers, the blood is thrown in greater quanti∣ty and velocity into the vessels of the inter∣nal Viscera, because it there meets with less resistance than at the surface of the body, and among the rest into the Vena Portae, in consequence of which a greater quantity than
<PB N="147" REF="024239_0153_0FC5706A05E769E0"/>
ordinary of bile is secreted and effused into the Vessica Fellis, and Duodenum, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>REMOTE CAUSES.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the Situation and Season in which this Fever prevails; from the manner in which it begins; from the subjects most liable to it; from its terminating so general∣ly in an Intermittent, &amp;c. I am convinced that it is produced by the very same oc∣casional or exciting cause as the Intermitting Fever, and that this exciting cause is Marsh Miasmata. The principal difference between Intermittents and Remittents, appears to consist in the Constitution or Diathesis pre∣sent, upon which the occasional cause ope∣rates; in other words, the difference in the symptoms of the Intermitting and the Remitting Fever, is owing to the difference of Diathesis, tone, and vigour of the Solids, particularly of the Muscular Fibres of the system. This is analogous to what happens in other circumstances—Exposure to cold in Winter, when the constitution is most
<PB N="148" REF="024239_0154_0FC5706B815389E0"/>
firm and vigorous, occasions Rheumatism or Pleurisy—In Summer, exposure to cold produces Catarrh or Diarrhaea.</P>
<P>THE circumstances preceding and accom∣panying Cholera, furnish sufficient proof that it does not depend upon the same cau∣ses as Fever.</P>
<P>THE subjects of this Fever have for the most part been greatly relaxed by the long protracted heat of the preceding Summer. Every thing else that debilitates the Nervous System, may be considered as a predispo∣sing cause.</P>
<P>THE observations of Physicians well qua∣lified for the enquiry, made in different regi∣ons of the earth, have proved beyond con∣troversy, that exhalations issuing from moist and marshy grounds, which are now called Miasmata, are the principal cause in the production of Intermittents and Remit∣tents.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="024239_0155_0FC5706D07E34D68"/>
THESE appear to operate, by inducing a debility in the nervous system, diminishing the energy of the brain, and all the functions of the body depending thereon.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>PROXIMATE CAUSE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS appears to be a state of debility more predominant in the Nervous, than the Vascular system.</P>
<P>THAT such a distinction really exists, is evident from the debility which prevails in all the functions during the forming stage, even of inflammatory diseases.</P>
<P>THE Spasm assigned by Dr. Cullen, is now generally known to want support—Dr. Brown, by making no distinction between the separate conditions and powers of the human body, and by confounding sensibi∣lity with irritability, has been guilty of a much grosser error, and one which has had pernicious effects in practice.</P>

<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<PB N="150" REF="024239_0156_0FC5706EAD9ADDA0"/>
<HEAD>Of the Cure of the REMITTING FE∣VER.</HEAD>
<P>THE indications of cure in this Fever, as well as in every other whose pre∣dominant symptoms flow from a state of Muscular debility, consist simply in resto∣ring power and energy to the Nervous system.</P>
<P>THIS we are taught by that surest guide, experience, is best accomplished by the application of certain stimulating and tonic powers, adjusted as near as possible to the state of debility present: for we know of no antidote to these Miasmata, which are so poisonous to the source of life.</P>
<P>IF the spontaneous vomiting has not e∣vacuated the stomach sufficiently, from 10 to 30 grains of Ipeca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uana, or a small dose of Tart. Emetic, should be given in the evening, its operation promoted by warm water or Camomile Tea, and an Anodyne
<PB N="151" REF="024239_0157_0FC5707240B5E668"/>
given after its operation, the feet having been previously bathed in warm water.</P>
<P>IF called early in the complaint, Blisters should also be applied to the Wrists as soon as the Anodyne is taken—By these means an intermission is very frequently produced; when the exhibition of the Bark in Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, next day, commonly prevents a return of Fever.</P>
<P>FROM 20 to 30 drops of Laudanum, or from one to two grains of solid Opium, is the proper quantity to be given at a dose.</P>
<P>WEAK warm Punch, Wine-whey, or Sangree, will be proper after the Anodyne; and, if the Feverish Symptoms are not high, will be proper through the whole course of the Disease. Snake-root Tea, has also been found a very useful drink, particularly du∣ring the Paroxism—In the remission, it an∣swers best when joined with a Decoction of the Bark, with the addition of more
<PB N="152" REF="024239_0158_0FC57073B27E9320"/>
or less Wine, according as the debility manifest in the several functions may in∣dicate.</P>
<P>IF the Emetic does not also operate by stool, or if symptoms of debility render the exhibition hazardous, a free evacuation should be procured, by giving the fourth part of an ounce of Glauber's Salts, dissolved in beverage or Tamarind-water, every three hours, till it has had the desired effect.</P>
<P>AS soon as this is accomplished, imme∣diate recourse should be had to the Pe∣ruvian Bark, which should be given without reserve, and in as large quantities as the Sto∣mach will bear, without regard to the pre∣sence or absence of Fever—except that, du∣ring the Paroxism or Exacerbation, it ought to be given without Wine, provided the Fe∣ver does not appear to be assuming a conti∣nued form, or is not strongly marked with general debility.</P>
<P>DURING the remission therefore, let Wine
<PB N="153" REF="024239_0159_0FC57075849D2ED0"/>
be joined with it, and given liberally▪ but during the Paroxism, let it be given, if in substance, with Snake-root Tea, or any mild Aromatic infusion: if it can not be taken in substance, let two ounces of it, with half an ounce of Serpentar. Virgin. be boiled in two pints of water, to one pint. A wine-glass full of the strained liquor, more or less, accord∣ing to circumstances, with an equal quanti∣ty of sound old Port, or half as much Madei∣ra Wine, to be given every hour during the remission, and the same quantity every two hours during the Paroxism without the Wine, or with a considerably less quantity.</P>
<P>IF it occasions either Puking or Diar∣rhaea, two or three drops of Laudanum, and a little Cinnamon, or spirituous Peppermint Water, should be added to every second or third dose.</P>
<P>WHEN Griping and Sickness are very fre∣quent and distressing, they indicate an accu∣mulation of bilious or mucous matter in the Primae Viae, and have often been relieved by
<PB N="154" REF="024239_0160_0FC5707C526939F0"/>
a common Glister, or the exhibition of a mild laxative. Rhubarb and Cream of Tar∣tar answers very well, or a small pill of Ca∣lomel or Aloes, taken at bed-time, or early in the morning, without interrupting the exhibition of the Cortex, Vinous Drinks, and Cordial Regimen.</P>
<P>BUT a Diarrhaea should always be attended to, and diminished, otherwise the Patient's strength will be inevitably reduced by it.</P>
<P>IF, as some times happens, an incessant vomiting should come on, heated substan∣ces should be applied to the extremi∣ties and surface of the body; hot spirituous drinks given almost continually, with a few drops of Laudanum and Lavender Compound; and Blisters applied to the Wrists and Stomach, and Sinapisms or Ru∣befacients to the Feet.</P>
<P>IF the Stomach rejects the Laudanum as soon as swallowed, it should be administer∣ed
<PB N="155" REF="024239_0161_0FC57080892629C0"/>
in a Glister of Camomile Tea or Barley water.</P>
<P>DR. BLANE informs us, that he has put a stop to the incessant Puking which accompa∣nies the yellow Fever of the West Indies, by the application of Blisters when Opium failed.</P>
<P>TEN grains of Sal. Tart. mixed with 30 grs. of Cream of Tartar, with a few drops of Laudanum, and a little Essence of Pep∣permint or Cinnamon, taken in a draught of warm water in the act of effervescence, has often put a stop to severe vomiting; but unless it be swallowed while in an efferves∣cing state, it has no effect. Its good effect therefore seems to depend upon the fixed air extricated by this process.</P>
<P>THERE is a greater probability of put∣ting a speedy termination to this Fever, when the Remission is very distinct, though the Paroxism may be very violent, than when the Remissions are more obscure, and
<PB N="156" REF="024239_0162_0FC57082006983B8"/>
the Feverish Symptoms, during the Paroxism, are less violent; because the less distinct and perfect the Remission, the greater is the debility present in the whole system, in the Vascular, as well as in the Ner∣vous.</P>
<P>DR. CULLEN has ascertained in a very satisfactory manner, that the hot stage of Fevers, almost always corresponds with the preceding cold stage; and that when a Fe∣ver commences with a sudden and violent cold stage, and is soon after succeeded by a hot stage, it is a certain proof that the System, and especially the Heart and Ar∣teries are but little, if any, impaired in re∣spect to vigour and activity. He has also ascertained, that when the Paroxism of any Fever is preceded by little, or no cold stage, and the more it resembles the continued form, the greater the debility.</P>
<P>THE cause of the Remitting Fever, cer∣tainly
<PB N="157" REF="024239_0163_0FC5708389BB1E90"/>
operates more powerfully on the Ner∣vous System than on the Vascular, other∣wise the great activity which is often obser∣vable in the Pulse, during the hot stage, could not take place.</P>
<P>THE advantage of cleanliness and pure air in Fevers, is now too generally acknow∣ledged to require insisting on here.</P>
<P>WHEN the debility is very great, and the circulation very languid, the patient's limbs should be wrapped up in heated woollen cloths, occasionally repeated.</P>
<P>BUT when the skin feels preternaturally hot, and the patient much exhausted, wash∣ing his body with cold Spirits of Wine or Brandy, always affords grateful refreshment, and renders it cooler.</P>
<P>WHEN this Fever degenerates into a con∣tinued form, with great prostration of strength, foul and parched Tongue, and
<PB N="158" REF="024239_0164_0FC5708783646498"/>
a collection of filthy, dark-coloured mucus about the Teeth and Gums, and resembles the Typhus, or Putrid and Contagious Fever (which arises from a vitiated state of human effluvia,) in all its symptoms—The same plan of treatment should still be pursued; with only this difference, that the Bark and Wine must now be given in larger quantity, and continued day and night.</P>
<P>A BOLUS containing five or six grains of Volatile Salts, may also be given every two or three hours, and Rubefacients may be fre∣quently applied to the limbs; but Blisters seldom produce any good effect in the low state of either this Fever or the Ty∣phus.</P>
<P>DURING the Convalescent State, the pa∣tient should guard against exposure to cold damp air, and should make use of Hux∣ham's Tincture of the Bark, several times a-day, either mixed with Wine or Water,
<PB N="159" REF="024239_0165_0FC57088B2B25CF0"/>
till his digestive powers are perfectly re∣stored.</P>
<P>THE forming stage of most diseases re∣semble each other so much in the greatest number of Symptoms, that it is difficult to distinguish one from another at their com∣mencement.</P>
<P>I RECOLLECT a case of Hepatitis that occurred this month, which began with sym∣toms resembling those of the Remitting Fe∣ver.</P>
<P>THE Disease commenced with a distress∣ing sensation of cold, accompanied with fre∣quent puking and great prostration of strength; these were in a few hours succeeded by high Fever and pain in the region of the Liver. After opening a Vein, all the symptoms of debility accompanied with puking again returned.</P>
<P>DETERRED by this circumstance, and
<PB N="160" REF="024239_0166_0FC5708A5BCAFD80"/>
by the frequent return of puking from repeating the Venaesection, the pain increas∣ed, and in a few days terminated in an Ab∣scess. This at length discharged itself gradual∣ly by the Intestines; and though the patient was reduced to the lowest extremity of life, he afterwards recovered, and at present enjoys a good state of health. The quan∣tity of Laudanum which this patient took after the Abscess began to discharge, in order to restrain puking, and the quan∣tity of strong Brandy Toddy which he took to preserve his strength would be scarcely credited if I was to spe∣cify it.</P>
<P>DR. WISTER, who was consulted on the case, can bear witness that he took ten drops of the best Thebaic Tincture four times a-day, and from 60 to 80 drops in the course of the night, for six weeks; great part of which time we expected, at our morning visits, to find him
<PB N="161" REF="024239_0167_0FC57094CF888448"/>
dead, to such a low ebb and distressing situation was he reduced: But, contrary to our expectations, his appetite gradually returned: the evacuation was no more per∣ceived; his Hectic ceased; and health re∣turned, after five months confinement to bed.</P>
<P>THE reason he was allowed distilled Spi∣rits was, because his Stomach would not retain Wine: Even distilled Spirits was rejected, except when taken in water al∣most scalding hot.</P>
<P>IN the Autumn of 1781 and 1782, I be∣lieve, to speak within bounds, more than one-half of the children, between the age of six and eighteen months, in Southwark, died of the Cholera Morbus, Diarrhoea, and Remitting Fever.</P>
<P>OF late years, the mortality has not been so great, owing, I presume, to their being
<PB N="162" REF="024239_0168_0FC5709633BB1290"/>
better supplied with cloathing and whole∣some food, and to the greater regard which has been by all ranks paid to Cleanliness, in consequence of the greater prosperity which they have experienced, since the re∣storation and increase of Trade; and, in a great measure, to the Physicians of the Dis∣pensary, who have the charge of all the poor∣er classes, many hundreds of which would perish annually for want of adequate assist∣ance, if it was not for that charitable and very useful Institution. Before that Insti∣tution was established, multitudes fell a sacrifice to the ignorance and villainy of Quacks and Nostrum-mongers.</P>
<P>THE arching of the Dock, and the cul∣tivation of the Lots around the City, which were formerly waste Commons, and many of them covered with stagnant water, has also removed a considerable source of Dis∣case from the City and its vicinity.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="024239_0169_0FC57097B3D21530"/>
NOR is it unreasonable to suppose, that the improved state of Physic, has had some share in retarding the progress of Mor∣tality.</P>
<P>IT is to the labours and sagacity of the immortal Cullen, that the world is in∣debted for the principal improvements which have been made in the treatment of Diseases.</P>
<P>FOR although he has dealt rather liberally in Hypothesis, all his practical Rules are supported by experience.</P>

<P>WIND W. and S. W.</P>
<P>THE Weather was dry and cool the great∣est part of this Month, as there were only eight days on which any Rain fell; and that was in small quantities, and at considerable intervals.</P>
<P>THE changes in the temperature of the air, were often very considerable and sud∣den.</P>
<P>FROST, which was first observed in the City and Suburbs on the 24th of September, became very severe, and rendered Fires con∣stantly agreeable.</P>
<P>DISEASES this Month were similar to
<PB N="165" REF="024239_0171_0FC5709D0C2C3218"/>
those in September, with the addition of He∣patic Affections.</P>
<P>THESE last generally required and were re∣lieved by bleeding and purging with Calomel; when obstinate, a repetition of bleeding was often found necessary, and sometimes the ap∣plication of a Blister.</P>
<P>GREAT numbers of children were inocu∣lated this month, but in general the disease was not so favourable as it had been the pre∣ceding Spring, owing perhaps to the relaxed state of the Solids, in consequence of the pre∣ceding heat of the Summer—With some it became Confluent.</P>
<P>WHEN called to a patient previous to, or at the commencement of the eruption in the natural way, I always advised him to be kept out of bed in the day time, and to be covered very lightly in the night, exposing him to a greater degree of cold than would be safe in a state
<PB N="166" REF="024239_0172_0FC570A456D104C8"/>
a state of health, and insisted upon keeping his Bowels very free with Saline Laxatives, till the end of the sixth day from the first commencement of the symptoms; after which I directed a mild Anodyne every night with a Laxative occasionally, if Costive—By this method many were apparently preserved from having the disease in a severe manner.</P>
<P>IN cases of Convulsion, I permitted the feet to be bathed in warm-water, avoided exposure to cold, and gave Laudanum in Gli∣sters when the patient could not swallow, till the Convulsions ceased, and the Fever began to rise; after which I gradually admitted ex∣posure to cooler Air, allowed cool Drinks and mild Laxatives, and if the Fever became very violent, directed the patient to be carried a∣broad into the open air, &amp;c.</P>
<P>WHEN the Symptoms of debility were great, the Pustles flat and pale, I always gave a little Calomel, joined with an Anodyne, at
<PB N="167" REF="024239_0173_0FC570A5F44FFBA8"/>
bed-time and a strong decoction of the Bark and Serpentaria, with Wine, in the day-time.</P>
<P>IN most cases I found the Bark and Wine serviceable from the 11th to the 17th day.</P>
<P>FOR about the 11th day, even in the Dis∣tinct sort, if the Pustles are numerous, the swelling of the face begins to subside and the strength to decline.</P>
<P>WHEN the hands and feet were much swelled, I endeavoured to promote Urine by Diuretics, at the same time that I endea∣voured to support the strength by Wine and Bark and a Cordial Regimen.</P>
<P>WITHOUT attention is paid to this cir∣cumstance, the severish Symptoms generally become very violent and often fatal.</P>
<P>I have found Nitre dissolved in Beverage, when given in small Doses, answer very well—When a Diarrhoea supervened about this
<PB N="168" REF="024239_0174_0FC570A773F0A568"/>
this period, and manifestly weakened the Pa∣tient, I always endeavoured to check it, by giving three or four drops of Thebaic Tinc∣ture, frequently in a spirituous Julep—but not otherwise.</P>
<P>WHEN the Pock is dry, and formed into a crust, a Hectic Fever is often the conse∣quence, owing to debility, and the obstructi∣on of perspiration: Here small doses of Vo∣latiles, with the Bark and Serpentaria, the Warm-Bath and Flannel Cloathings, by re∣storing strength and perspiration, generally effect a cure.</P>
<P>WHEN a Pregnant Woman takes the Small Pox in the natural way, Abortion is gene∣rally the consequence. The late Dr. Bond used to say, that this was always the case; but I have, however, seen instances to the contrary. But the frequency of its occurrence, ought to make us decline inoculating women in that condition. Does the mother's hav∣ing
<PB N="169" REF="024239_0175_0FC570A8F0FB94D0"/>
the Small-Pox when pregnant, prevent her child from receiving the infection after its birth?</P>

<P>"MANY days in this month were very pleasant and agreeable; but the greatest part of the Weather was cold, changeable and wet, with very variable winds—On the 26th, there
<PB N="170" REF="024239_0176_0FC570AB91577400"/>
was a fall of snow for the first time this month."</P>
<P>DISEASES.</P>
<P>MOST of the Diseases which occurred this month, were of an Inflammatory na∣ture, owing to the coldness and variableness of the Weather.</P>
<P>RHEUMATIC and Catarrhal affections were the most common; and the generality of those who had been subject to the Gout, were again visited by that foe to repose.</P>
<P>AS Rheumatism is a very common and a very distressing compliant in this country, particularly in Philadelphia, I hope the fol∣lowing description, and method of treatment, founded on observation and experience, will not be unacceptable or useless.</P>
<P>THIS Disease is particularly distinguished
<PB N="171" REF="024239_0177_0FC570B86BF41340"/>
by Pains affecting the larger Joints. It be∣gins with the common Symptoms of Fever; and as soon as the Hot Stage is formed, is generally attended with a strong, full, and hard Pulse.</P>
<P>THE Pain seldom continues long in the same Joint; but shifts in a surprising manner from one to another—The Pain and Fever is always worst in the evening and night, owing in some measure to the heat of the bed and covering.</P>
<P>THIS Disease differs from the generality of Inflammatory Diseases in this, that it is not apt to terminate in Suppuration, but ef∣fusions sometimes are occasioned by it, of a transparent gelatinous Fluid, into the ten∣dinous Sheaths.</P>
<P>WHILEVER the Disease depends upon an Inflammatory Diathesis, the pained joints are relieved by exposure to a colder tempera∣ture
<PB N="172" REF="024239_0178_0FC570BCB4BA4A80"/>
than usual—When the Inflammatory Diathesis is removed or exhausted, the pain is always aggravated by cold, and re∣lieved by heat. By due attention to these circumstances and the state of the Fever, we may always ascertain when the Disease is in an Acute, and when in a Chronic State.</P>
<P>THIS Disease is generally occasioned by exposure to cold and damp Air, after the body has been heated by fatiguing exercise, &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE Proximate cause of this Disease, appears to be an Atony in the extreme Ves∣sels, particularly of the Joints, while at the same time the rest of the System is in a state of increased tone and excitement.</P>
<P>I suppose, with Dr. Cullen, that the ap∣plication of cold, especially when combined with moisture is the most common occasi∣onal or exciting cause of Rheumatism; and that it produces its sedative and debilitating
<PB N="173" REF="024239_0179_0FC570BDF28A3B80"/>
effects, more particularly upon the vessels of the Joints, from their being more loosely and imperfectly covered by a cellular texture, than the intermediate parts of the Limbs.</P>
<P>THE indications of cure are, to restore a due balance and adjustment between the af∣fected Vessels and the rest of the System.</P>
<P>CURE.</P>
<P>BLOOD should be drawn every day, in a larger or smaller quantity, proportioned to the strength and fulness of the Pulse, and the acuteness of the Pain; and the Bowels kept very Laxative with Saline Purges, till the Pain and Fever are reduced.</P>

<P>THE admission of cold Air, and the use of cool subacid liquors are found beneficial: But every thing heating or stimulating, aggravates the Pain and Fever—Even Opi∣um, always aggravates the Disease, while any Inflammatory Symptoms continue.</P>
<P>IN the Chronic Rheumatism the plan of treatment must be reversed. Here ten grains of Gum Guiacum, rubbed with a little Cream of Tartar and Loaf Sugar, and given in any agreeable vehicle, three or four times a-day, and a Su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ic Anodyne at night, ge∣nerally affords relief. Warm flannel cloth, should be worn about the affected limbs; and
<PB N="175" REF="024239_0181_0FC570C0F9592318"/>
when only weakness remains, they may be rubbed with the Oil of Amber or Tincture of Cantharides.</P>
<P>THE Cortex and Serpentaria, with the moderate use of Wine, and a Cordial Regi∣men, will all be proper to reinstate the Pati∣ent's health.</P>
<P>THE application of Blisters to the Joints, have often beneficial effects in the Acute Rheumatism; but in chronic cases, I have seen better and more expeditious effects, when the pains were fixed, by rubbing Mer∣curial Oinment very liberally upon the af∣fected parts, and giving the simple Mercurial Pill, agreeable to the advice of Dr. Clark, till the mouth began to be affected. The application of Vitriolic AEther to swelled Joints, especially when Oedematous, has also been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound serviceable.</P>
<P>THE Cold Bath has also often been em∣ployed
<PB N="176" REF="024239_0182_0FC570C4DCD93160"/>
with advantage under the last men∣tioned circumstances.</P>
<P>IT certainly is an invigorating remedy, when the powers of the system are not too much reduced to admit of re-action.</P>

DISEASES.</P>
<P>ALMOST every kind of Inflammatory Complaint occurred in Philadelphia: But affections of the Lungs, whether in the slighter form of Catarrh, or more dangerous one of Peripneumony, were most prevalent.</P>
<P>SEVERAL cases of Cynanche Trachealis, or Hives, also occurred.</P>
</DIV4>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the CYNANCHE TRACHEALIS, or Suffocating CATARRH, vulgarly called the HIVES.</HEAD>
<P>THE diagnostic Symptoms of this Dis∣ease are; a hoarseness, with some shrillness and ringing sound, both in speaking and coughing. At the same time, there is a sense of Pain about the Larynx; some dif∣ficulty of respiration, with a whizzing sound in inspiration, as if the passage of the
<PB N="179" REF="024239_0185_0FC570D010343568"/>
Air was straitened—The cough, without exception, in all that I have seen, was dry, harsh and sonorous—Together with these Symptoms, there is a frequency of Pulse, a Restlessness, and generally an increase of Heat—Neither redness nor tumour are perceptible within the Fauces, nor any alteration in the size of the Tonsils externally.</P>
<P>WITH the described Symptoms, and par∣ticularly with great difficulty of breathing, and a sense of strangling in the Fauces, the Patient some times suddenly expires.</P>
<P>THIS Disease attacks infants at the breast less frequently than after they are weaned. After this period, the younger they are the more they are liable to it: The frequency of it becomes less as children advance in age and vigour; and there are no cases recorded of children above twelve years of age being af∣fected with it. It very frequently occurs in Philadelphia, both in Autumn and Spring, and even in Winter, among the infants of the
<PB N="180" REF="024239_0186_0FC570D1DBAF0558"/>
Germans who generally sit in rooms heated by close stoves.</P>
<P>IT often manifestly comes on from ex∣posure to cold and damp Air, after having been previously heated or thrown into pro∣fuse perspiration.</P>
<P>PERHAPS the slavering of Saliva, by wetting and chilling the neck, may favour the operation of colder Air.</P>
<P>THE frequency of its commencing with the ordinary Symptoms of a Catarrh, fa∣vours this conjecture.</P>
<P>THERE have been many dissections made of infants who have died of this Disease; and there has almost constantly appeared a preternatural Membrane lining the whole internal surface of the upper part of the Tra∣chea, and extending in the same manner downwards into some of its Ramifications. This preternatural Membrane may be easily
<PB N="181" REF="024239_0187_0FC570D53719D1D8"/>
separated, and sometimes has been found se∣parated in part from the subjacent proper Membrane of the Trachea. This last is commonly found without any appearance of Corrosion or Ulceration; but it frequently shews the vestiges of Inflammation, and is covered by a matter resembling Pus.</P>
<P>FROM the remote causes of this Disease; from the Catarrhal Symptoms commonly attending it; from the Fever constantly pre∣sent with it; from the same kind of preter∣natural Membrane being found in the Tra∣chea when the Cynanche Maligna is com∣municated to it: and from the vestiges of In∣flammation on the Trachea discovered upon Dissection, we must conclude, that the Dis∣ease consists in an Inflammatory affection of the Mucous Membrane of the Larynx and Trachea, producing an Exudation analogous to that found on the surface of inflamed Viscera, the thinner parts of which evaporat∣ing, and being carried off by the Air in Res∣piration,
<PB N="182" REF="024239_0188_0FC56DE7337FEDF0"/>
leaves the remainder thick, dry, and solid.</P>
<P>THOUGH this Disease manifestly consists in an Inflammatory Affection, it does not commonly end either in Suppuration or Gangrene.</P>
<P>THE peculiar and troublesome circum∣stance of the Disease seems to consist in a Spasm of the Muscles of the Glottis, which by inducing a Suffocation, prevents the com∣mon consequences of Inflammation.</P>
<P>WHEN this Disease terminates in Health, it appears to be by a resolution of the Inflam∣mation; by a ceasing of the Spasm of the Glottis; by an expectoration of the Matter exuding from the Trachea, and of the crusts formed there; and frequently it ends only with an Expectoration, resembling that which attends a simple Catarrh.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="024239_0189_0FC56DEBF678CB30"/>
WHEN it ends fatally, it is by a Suffocati∣on, in consequence of a Spasm affecting the Glottis; but sometimes probably owing to a quantity of Matter filling the Bronchiae.</P>
<P>As the Disease has been incontrovertibly proved to be an Inflammatory Affection, the cure at present is generally attempted by the same means as have been found most suc∣cessful in other Inflammatory Affections.</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>BLEEDING,</HEAD>
<P>BOTH general and topical, has often gi∣ven immediate relief, when employed ear∣ly in the Disease; and by being repeated to a second, and even to a third time, when the difficulty of breathing and heat of the Body were considerable, has entirely cured the Disease.</P>
<P>VOMITING immediately after bleeding has generally a very good effect—For this
<PB N="184" REF="024239_0190_0FC56DED3A489FB0"/>
purpose I prefer a solution of Tartar Emetic, in Honey and Water, of tepid warmth, in the proportion of three grains to six tea-spoon∣fuls of the Honey and Water; of which one tea-spoonful may be given every quarter of an hour, till it operates, and the operation promoted with Bran, Linseed, Mallows, Balm or Hysop Tea sweetened with Honey.</P>
<P>IF the principal Symptoms are not mani∣festly mitigated after a second bleeding, the operation of an Emetic, and the ex∣hibition of a Laxative Glister, (if the Emetic has not also proved purgative) a Blis∣ter Plaster, guarded with fine Gauze, should be applied without delay on each side of the Neck, so as to reach from the root of each Ear to the Trachea, and as soon as they have produced Vessications, they are to be remov∣ed, and the blistered parts dressed with Basili∣cum, or perhaps something more stimulating.</P>
<P>WHEN the Disease happens to children
<PB N="185" REF="024239_0191_0FC56DF101B6C050"/>
debilitated by previous Disease, blood letting must be employed more sparingly, or per∣haps omitted altogether; and our depen∣dence must be placed on Emetics, Lax∣ative Glisters, or purges of Calomel, and the application of Blisters; observing at the same time to keep the Patient's body cooler than would be agreeable if in health, and to enjoin the strict observance of the Antiphlo∣gistic Regimen; which consists in avoiding every stimulating impression; such as Heat, Exercise, Impatience, Animal Food, Spices, Salt, Butter, Sweet Meats, dried and hard Fruits, distilled or fermented Liquors, &amp;c.</P>
<P>A Decoction of Barley and Raisins, or Oatmeal Gruel, with ripe juicy Fruits, ei∣ther raw or baked are the only articles of Diet allowable; and the Liquids already spe∣cified, or those of a similar quality, acidulat∣ed with Lime Juice, are the most suitable drinks.</P>
<P>DR. George Glentworth has done me
<PB N="186" REF="024239_0192_0FC56DF65C7B3E98"/>
the honour to inform me, that he lately cured two children of the Cynanche Tra∣chealis, by putting them into the Warm Bath, when in danger of suffocating, imme∣diately after one blood-letting, and the exhi∣bition of a Puke, in the early Stage of the Disease—The whole of the Bodies of these Patients was immersed in the Bath, and when taken out, they were put to bed be∣tween blankets, and a copious perspiration promoted by warm Beverage or Balm Tea.</P>
<P>I HAVE often advised that a vessel of hot Water should be held under the Patient's chin, for the purpose of breathing the vapour issu∣ing from it, but never perceived any bene∣ficial effect from it.</P>
<P>PERHAPS when the Disease has been of several days continuance, it may assist in softening and loosening the preternatural Membrane; but I apprehend that the heat it occasions must be injurious in the early
<PB N="187" REF="024239_0193_0FC56DF7C27092A0"/>
Stage of the Disease, while the Inflamma∣tory Symptoms are considerable.</P>
<P>WHEN every other remedy fails, and the Patient is in immediate danger of suffocati∣on, I think Bronchotomy might be tried with propriety. Perhaps life might be restored, even after suffocation, if the operation was immediately performed, and the Lungs in∣flated with bellows. If Bronchotomy suc∣ceeds, it will be necessary to keep a suitable Canula in the Orifice for the Patient to breath through till the Disease is removed.</P>
<P>IN order to insure the success of the Puke, it ought to be exhibited every fourth or sixth hour if the strength will permit.</P>
<P>I HAVE also seen good effects produced by the exhibition of Calomel in large and re∣peated Doses; but not so uniformly as from the Emetic Solution.</P>

<P><PB N="192" REF="024239_0198_0FC56E05F3F70250"/>
FROM the three preceding Bills of Mor∣tality, it appears that the number of Births in Philadelphia at present, annually, is only a little more than double the number of Deaths.</P>
<P>THE numerous Deaths which occur here, appear to be more owing to the sudden vicis∣situdes of Weather than to any other cause; for according to the observations of Professor Kalm, (page 104.) "There is hardly a country on earth in which the Weather changes so often in a Day as it does here."</P>
<P>IT frequently changes from excessive heat to piercing cold in less than twenty four hours—Sometimes it changes five or six times in the same day.</P>
<P>THE following calculations, the result of observations for ten years on the Lon∣don Bills of Mortality, by Mr. Simpson,
<PB N="193" REF="024239_0199_0FC56E09DAB43A38"/>
with additional remarks by Dr. Foulke: ex∣tracted from his Oration on Longevity, de∣livered before the Philosophical Society at Philadelphia, are inserted to shew, that the probabilities or chances of enjoying health, and prolonging life, is much greater in the City of Philadelphia, and some other parts of the United States, than in any other dis∣tricts of the World, containing a proportion∣able number of inhabitants.</P>
<P>BY Mr. Sympson's observations, it ap∣pears that not one-half of the Persons born in London live to be three years old; not one∣third to be 25; not one-fourth to be 38; not one-sixth part to be 49; not one-eighth to be 59; and not more than one in 500 of them to be 78.</P>
<P>IT appears from the observations of Dr. Price, that instances of Longevity are not al∣ways in proportion to the rareness of deaths in the early periods of life.</P>
<P>"IN Pais de Vaud in Switzerland, he
<PB N="194" REF="024239_0200_0FC56E0B346C5578"/>
says only one in 45 dies annually." In Lon∣don nearly one in 20 and three-fourths dies annually; in Vienna, one in 19½ in Holy Cross near Shrewsbury in England, one in 33.</P>
<P>IN Pais de Vaud one half of the inhabitants live to the age of 41. In a Country Parish in Brandenburgh, where the annual Deaths are in the same proportion as in Pais de Vaud, one-half the Persons born do not reach their 26th year—In Holy Cross one half reach their 27th year—In London and Berlin, such is the melancholy condition of the Inhabi∣tants, that one-half of the children are buried before they are two years and three-fourths old.</P>
<P><Q>THE ravage of Mortality is still more excessive at Vienna, where the second is the last year of life to half the Persons born in that City.</Q></P>
<P>DR. PRICE proceeds to give us the pro∣portion of those who reach 80 years of age in different places.</P>
<Q><PB N="195" REF="024239_0201_0FC56E0E4BCBD620"/>
<P>WE shall here find apparent contradicti∣ons, if we are not prepared to expect instances of Longevity in the same places, which pro∣duce even the largest proportion of annual Deaths.</P>
<P>FOR instance—Holy Cross near Shrews∣bury, furnishes a larger proportion of annual Deaths than Pais de Vaud or Brandenburg; but at the last place, one person in 22½ only reaches 80 years of age; and in Pais de Vaud, 1 only in 21 and a half; whilst in Holy Cross, one in 11 is found to reach this venerable pe∣riod of existence.</P></Q>
<P>THE difficulty and consequent uncertainty of all political Arithmetic weakens our con∣fidence in calculations of this nature; but if the most ingenious in Europe, who have every means of information in their power, are heard with diffidence, what confidence, can we expect to inspire whose sources of information are as yet so scanty and imper∣fect?
<PB N="196" REF="024239_0202_0FC56E1225AD33E0"/>
"We shall, however, venture to draw some inferences from such documents and data as we do possess.</P>
<P>THE expectation of life to an Infant just born is 18 years even in London, where early Deaths are more numerous, perhaps, than any where else except in Vienna.</P>
<P>ON Dr. Price's principles, the number of annual Births, being multiplied into the ex∣pectation of life, should give the number of native Inhabitants; for instance, it is said the Births in this City (Philadelphia) last year, were 2192, and this number multiplied by 18, the lowest expectation of life for an infant in Europe, amounts to 39456. But as it has since been found, that the number of inhabi∣tants residing in the City and suburbs of Phi∣ladelphia is 42,400, the inference follows (upon a presumption, that the registry of Births is accurate) that the expectation for the life of every Infant is more than 18 to 1 here.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="024239_0203_0FC56E1382B636C0"/>
IN all European Cities a calculation on these principles gives a result confessedly short of the real number of inhabitants, and the calculator is obliged to have recourse to the excess of Burials more than Births to ac∣count for the difference. But in this coun∣try, favourable as it is equally to Population and Longevity, we have even in its largest City an excess of Births more than of Burials, in the extraordinary proportion of 11 to 5, notwithstanding strangers who die in Phi∣ladelphia are included in the list of burials.</P>
<P>BY comparing the number of annual Deaths in Philadelphia with the number of In∣habitants, we shall find that there is not more than one in 40 dies annually; and if we do not include strangers in the account of the funerals, it will be found that there is not more than one in 50 that dies here.</P>
<Q><P>FROM a paragraph in the News-paper, under the New-Haven Head, we find the
<PB N="198" REF="024239_0204_0FC56E14F0DA4578"/>
annual Deaths only in the proportion of 1 in 70 of the whole number of the Inhabitants; a proportion more flattering than any table we have met with, though the limited scale of this instance, and the corroborating circum∣stances cited, leave no room to doubt of its ac∣curacy.</P>
<P>THE learned and ingenious Dr. Samuel Smith of Princetown, (Author of the In∣fluence of Climate, &amp;c. upon the human body) has favoured me with an account of a number of Families in the Jersey State, by which it appears that of the living four-fifths of them were above 10 years old; more than one-half upwards of 20; two-sevenths above 30; one-fifth above 40; one-ninth above 50; and one-fourteenth had passed, and some very considerably, the period of 60 years.</P></Q>
<P><Q>MR. WM. BARTON's ingenious Letter, presented at the last meeting of the Society,
<PB N="199" REF="024239_0205_0FC56E1914144A10"/>
contains many curious particulars, and seems calculated to supply American data, the De∣sideratum of those tables with which other Countries have been furnished.</Q></P>
<P>IT appears from Mr. Barton's reference to Professor Wigglesworth, that one Person in eight of those buried in Ipswich Hamlet, in the State of Massachusetts, arrived to the very uncommon Age (in other Countries) of 80 years. "A proportion which must remain a monument of Longevity in all probability, only to be paralleled in the future History of our own Country."</P>
<P>D. PERCIVAL says, "in the Pais de Vaud, a district of the Province of Bern in Switzerland, and in a country Parish in Bran∣denburgh 1 in 45 of the Inhabitants die an∣nually; and at Stoke Damarell in Devonshire, 1 in 54; whereas in Edinburgh and Vienna, the yearly Mortality appears to be 1 in 20; in London 1 in 21; in Rome and Amsterdam, 1
<PB N="200" REF="024239_0206_0FC56E1A31095840"/>
in 22; in Northampton, 1 in 26; and in Holy Cross, 1 in 33.</P>
<P>IN the Pais de Vaud, the proportion of Inhabitants, who attain the Age of 80, is 1 in 21½ Brandenburgh, 1 in 22½ in Norwich, 1 in 27; in Manchester, 1 in 30; in London, 1 in 40; and in Edinburgh, 1 in 42. These facts afford a striking, but me∣lancholy, proof of the unfavourable influence of large towns on the duration of life.</P>
<P>FROM the most accurate computation, London is found to contain 601,750 inhabi∣tants; and from 1759 to 1768, the burials have exceeded the christenings every year upwards of 7000; which is the recruit the Metropolis requires annually from the Coun∣try to support the present number of its People.</P>
<P>IN 1757, a survey was made of Manches∣ter
<PB N="201" REF="024239_0207_0FC56E204C7A61B8"/>
and Salford. The number of Inhabitants then amounted to 19839; and the burials, exclusive of those among the Dissenters, were 778 per annum; but since that time the popu∣lousness of Manchester has considerably in∣creased. Half of all that are born in that town die under five years of age.</P>
<P>THE Island of Madeira, which is situated between. 32 and 33 degrees N. L. is so re∣markably healthy, that two-thirds of all that are born in it, live to be married. Autumn is the most healthy; Summer the most sickly season there.</P>
<P>IN Manchester Diseases are most frequent and fatal in the Months of January, February, and March; and least so in July, August, and September.</P>
<P>"AT Paris, and in Sweden, it has been observed, that Women not only live longer than Men; but that married Women live longer than single Women."</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="024239_0208_0FC56E21B6170FA8"/>
"AND in Switzerland it appears, particu∣larly from the calculations of M. Muret, that of equal numbers of single and married Wo∣men between the age of 15 and 25, more of the former died than of the latter, in the pro∣portion of two to one."</P>
<P>IN the Parish of Holy Cross, Salop, and account was taken by the Vicar, A. D. 1760, of the number of Males and Females, of the Age of 70 and upwards; the latter amounted to 35, the former only to eight.—See <HI>Price on reversionary payments, and Percival's Essays,</HI> Vol. 2d.</P>
<P>FROM a comparison of the Bills of Mor∣tality with the number of Inhabitants in the Parish of Manchester it appears, that whilst in the town the yearly Mortality is one to 28, in the Parish only one in 56 dies annu∣ally.</P>
<P>SUCH a striking disparity between the
<PB N="203" REF="024239_0209_0FC56E232FFF3B40"/>
healthiness of a large town and the Country which surrounds it, will scarcely be credited by those who have paid no attention to such enquiries.</P>

<HEAD>An ACCOUNT of the SITUATI∣ON, CLIMATE and DIS∣EASES of the STATE of DE∣LAWARE.</HEAD>
<P>"THIS State, which is only 92 Miles in length and 24 in breadth, is situated between 38° 30m. and 40°. North Latitude; and 0° and 1° 45m. Longitude, West from Philadelphia; and bounded North by Penn∣sylvania; East by the River and Bay of De∣laware; and West by Maryland."</P>
<P>"The East and South parts of this State are low and flat, and a considerable portion
<PB N="204" REF="024239_0210_0FC56E270C9A5568"/>
in an uncultivated condition, which occasi∣ons the Waters to stagnate; in consequence of which the Inhabitants are very subject to In∣termittents and Remittents in the latter end of Summer and beginning of Autumn."</P>
<P>IN the Northern parts of the State, the Land is more elevated and dry, the Soil fer∣tile, and produces Wheat in large quantities, and all the grains and grasses common to Pennsylvania.</P>
<P>DOVER, the capital of the State, stands on a small creek, a few Miles from the River Delaware, and contains about 100 dwelling houses.</P>
<P>WILMINGTON, the largest Town in the State, is but 28 Miles from Philadelphia, si∣tuate upon a gentle ascent of an eminence along Christina Creek, about one and a half Miles from the River Delaware. This
<PB N="205" REF="024239_0211_0FC56E29DD88C2B0"/>
Town, and the country to the North-West of it, is remarkably healthy.</P>
<P>THE difference observed in the vigour, ac∣tivity, complexions, and aspect of the People who inhabit the low flat country and those of the high and dry parts, affords a very strong argument in favour of the opinion of naturalists; who assert, that the healthiness or unhealthiness of any situation and climate may be ascertained from an accurate obser∣ance of these circumstances, together with the knowledge of the diet, drinks, and occupati∣ons of the Inhabitants, with as much cer∣tainty as the nature and quality of any Soil may be determined from a knowledge of the species of timber and other vegetables which grow upon it spontaneously.</P>
<P>THE influence which particular situations, Climates, exposure to the Sun and Wind, Abstinence, or the occasional use of only scan∣ty and indigestible Aliment, with an indo∣lent
<PB N="206" REF="024239_0212_0FC56E2AF1B49C00"/>
and slovenly manner of living, is almost incredible: So much so, that many Philoso∣phers have been induced to think, that the sable blackness of the Negro, is owing to a combination of those causes. But Anatomy demonstrates that this depends upon a very different circumstance; upon a peculiar and original organization and disposition of the r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te mucosum, and is as much constitutional as the colour of the Eye.</P>
<P>DR. JAMES TILTON, a Physician of ta∣lents and experience, residing in the Town of Dover, in a Letter to Dr. Redman, Presi∣dent of the College of Physicians, dated April 1790, remarks that "However there may be something essential and immutable in the nature of all Fevers, yet different con∣stitutions of the Atmosphere may occasion, of necessity, a variety of practice even in Dis∣eases of the same name.</P>
<P>HE further observes, that, "Before the
<PB N="207" REF="024239_0213_0FC56E2F640C0700"/>
war, during the winter, or inflammatory sea∣son of the year, they treated the Fevers which occured at that place, by repeated bleeding, and the general antiphlogistic methods with remarkable success; but the same method now would be attended with very different effects; the exceptions at least are so few as hardly to deserve mentioning."</P>
<P>"OPIUM, Wine, Bark, Volatile Salts are the Articles of Materia Medica, we are obliged chiefly to have recourse to."</P>
<Q><P>So contrary to the Phlogistic, and so fa∣vourable to the Typhous Diathesis is the present constitution of the Atmosphere, that blood-letting is very seldom used in the cure of Fever.</P>
<P>DR. TILTON also remarks, that the Small-pox, Measles and Influenza, though from contagion and a cause permanent and
<PB N="208" REF="024239_0214_0FC56E30B4B6B870"/>
immutably the same, yet they have not lately borne bleeding as they used to do; and very often in the latter Stages of these Fevers, the Bark, other Tonics and Cordials, become absolutely necessary.</P></Q>
<P>"THE Fever most prevalent with us this Winter and Spring, has usually attacked with congestion in the Lungs, resembling a Pe∣ripneumony; and yet the whole train of Symptoms indicative of Typhous weak∣ness, such as Pain of the Head, dry Tongue, foul Mouth, sick Stomach, attended sometimes with Vomiting and Purging, so regularly ensued, that this Fever may be denominated <HI>Peripneumonia Typhoides.</HI> Although at the beginning of this Fever a fullness of the Pulse, Pain of the Head, and aching Pains over the whole Body, might induce an incautious Physician to employ blood-let∣ling; we have learned from repeated observa∣tion to withhold the Lancet, or to use it in the most guarded manner."</P>

<HEAD>COPY of a LETTER from DOC∣TOR TILTON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Dover</HI> <DATE>20, <HI>April</HI> 1791.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IMMEDIATELY after writing my for∣mer Letter to you, I was seized with an in∣disposition that totally disqualified me for writing again so soon as I intended; and even at this time I cannot attempt more than a very general account of our Diseases.</P>
<P>THE medical History of Delaware, I appre∣hend, is peculiar in this circumstance, that a greater variety of Soil and Climate is compre∣hended within a smaller extent of Territory than can be found any where else. Within the narrow limits of a hundred Miles in length, upon the Delaware River, and the mean distance of about twenty-four Miles
<PB N="210" REF="024239_0216_0FC56E37B8DCF9F0"/>
back into the country, we have all the varie∣ties of Soil and Climate to be found in the middle States of America. That district of Delaware, which lies above Christiana creek, is perfectly Mountainous both in Soil and Climate; and these Mountains extend their influence throughout New-Castle county, so as to give a distinction of climate for every ten miles you descend down the De∣laware. From Apoquinimink creek to the lower end of the state, we have a level country, intersected at regular distances from five to ten miles, with creeks of tide∣water, bordered with extensive marshes; and these creeks head in immense swamps, on the western border of the state, from whence the water falls, equivocally, either into the Delaware or the Chesapeake. Throughout this low and flat district, Marsh Miasmata and other noxious exhalations, must be a plentiful source of Diseases. Cape Henlopen, nevertheless, enjoys all the ad∣vantages of a perfectly insular situation; and
<PB N="211" REF="024239_0217_0FC56E38F8D3FD28"/>
all the river shore, as well as the sea coast, find great relief from the sea-breeze; so that it is only the inland part of the country, where heat and stagnation concur to exalt the nox∣ious exhalations of our low grounds, that our state can truly be said to be sickly.</P>
<P>FROM this general description of our state, the following account of the health and dis∣eases of the inhabitants will be readily cre∣dited. The hills of Brandy wine and Chris∣tiana, furnish as healthful a district of coun∣try as any in America. The Borrough of Wilmington for health, beauty, and accom∣modation, is superior to any town I have seen, between the borders of New-England and the southern boundary of Virginia; and I have examined all the principal towns with∣in those limits, in a comparative point of view. George-Town, on the Potowmac, the intended Federal Residence, is more ana∣logous to Wilmington than any other, but manifestly the inferior of the two.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="024239_0218_0FC56E3A89DFC178"/>
THE town of New-Castle, though sur∣rounded by marshy sprouts from the Dela∣ware, is nevertheless rendered a healthful re∣sidence, by the refreshing breezes from the river that flow in upon the town as regu∣larly as the tide. All the county of New-Castle, and especially above Apoquinimink, is a delightful district of country, though the nearer the river the more healthful.</P>
<P>KENT, though blessed with the most fer∣tile soil, is the most sickly of the three coun∣ties of Delaware. Dover, the county town, and Metropolis of the State, is truly un∣healthful. Situated eight miles within land, and shut out from all water communication by high timbered woods, the air of this district, in the hot season of the year, suffers exceedingly from stagnation.</P>
<P>SUSSEX county, though as flat and marshy as Kent, is fanned on one side from the De∣laware, and on another from the Atlantic,
<PB N="213" REF="024239_0219_0FC56E3BF7DFDD10"/>
and the woods being cut down in less pro∣portion, than in the other counties, the a∣bundance of forest trees, pour forth a re∣freshment to the air that contributes, with the sea breezes, to the health of the inhabi∣tants.</P>
<P>LEWES, the county town of Sussex, stands upon the promontory of Cape-Henlopen, that stretches in between the Delaware and the Atlantic. This town is constantly fanned from the Ocean, and is as healthful as Ber∣mudas. This place has furnished the longest lived inhabitants of our state. Here are the greatest proportion of old people, and the most numerous swarms of children. Lewes is much resorted to by convalescents from the inland country and neighbouring states, and deserves to be still more frequented. Sickly boys, and others with swelled Spleens and ob∣structed Viscera, from repeated and obstinate Fevers, are quickly restored to health, barely by a residence at Lewes. All manner of
<PB N="214" REF="024239_0220_0FC56E402AEFE1E0"/>
nervous weakness is relieved by the salutary Air of our Cape; but Asthmatic and Hectic Patients should be cautious how they trust themselves there.</P>
<P>FREQUENT and sudden changes in the sensible qualities of our Atmosphere furnish another fertile source of Diseases. These changes depend solely on the course of the winds, and happen as often as the winds change. The wind blowing from between North and East, is generally cold and moist, except from June until September, when it is generally dry. From East to South comes our sea breeze, and is more salutary than any other. From South to West, the winds are hot, all the year round, and constitute our most noxious blasts. From West to North, the wind is at all seasons cold, dry in winter, and accompanied with gusts in summer.</P>
<P>THE most healthful season of our year is from the beginning of May, until the begin∣ing

of August. During this period, the wea∣ther is less variable than at other seasons; and I have conceived, that the rapid progress of vegetation, during the Spring contributes not a little to render the Air salubrious.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY after Harvest, our ende∣mical sickness begins. It generally increases throughout the month of August, and rages at its height during September.</P>
<P>BILIOUS, Intermitting and Remitting Fe∣vers, differing only in degree and modificati∣on, constitute the principal group of our an∣nual Fall Diseases. Dysenteries sometimes appear, but not oftener than in other coun∣tries; and it is remarkable, that Diseases of this kind oftener afflict the higher districts of New-Castle, than the flat counties of Kent and Sussex. The Cholera Morbus is a fre∣quent Disease in the hot months; and the Cholera Infantum, as described by Dr. Rush, has of late years made great devastation a∣mong
<PB N="216" REF="024239_0222_0FC56E452407EC38"/>
our children, more especially in the town of Dover. A swelled Spleen and vis∣ceral obstructions, are no uncommon conse∣quence of Fevers. Scorbutic and other pu∣trid affections often make their appearance in unhealthful situations: And if our Remit∣ting Fevers of the Fall are neglected or ill treated, they will often degenerate into the most perfect Typhus.</P>
<P>WITH the commencement of frost in Oc∣tober, the Fall Sickness abates in quantity, but wears very much the same type for a month or six weeks longer. The Bilious and Remitting Fevers of the Fall seem to lay the foundation of our Winter Fevers: for it is very remarkable, that those who have been the most harrassed by the Endemical Fall Sickness, are the most liable to the Synochous and Typhous Fever of the Winter. As to a simply Inflammatory Fever, in which local Inflammation is solely to be regarded, it is with us a rare occurrence indeed.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="024239_0223_0FC56E485E4B7288"/>
THE proportion of sickness among our inhabitants is as various as the Soil and Cli∣mate. In the highlands of New-Castle, a man thinks himself quite unfortunate to be overtaken by an Epidemic Sickness, even in the fall of the year; whereas an inhabitant of the inland districts of Kent and Sussex thinks himself lucky to escape a year or two together.</P>
<P>IN Wilmington and Lewes, the counte∣nances of the inhabitants never flag, but at all seasons witness the most vigorous health.</P>
<P>IN Dover every inhabitant suffers a demi∣nution of health, during the fall season, and exhibits a more pale and languid face than at other times.</P>
<P>A PREVALENCY of South-West Winds above all things increases and exalts our Fall Sickness; but when the Easterly Winds pre∣vail, during the sickly season, or frequent
<PB N="218" REF="024239_0224_0FC56E49732AB970"/>
showers happen from the North-West, they afford us great relief. Those habitations that border on the water, and are openly ex-exposed to the sea breeze, are every where healthy.</P>
<P>BOMBAYHOOK, though surrounded by immense Marshes, is nevertheless, next to Lewes, distinguished for the health of its In∣habitants. These several facts taken toge∣ther, lead us to conjecture, that Marsh Mi∣asmata will not altogether account for our Fall Sickness, nor the peculiar noxious influ∣ence of our South-West Winds, which in∣jure us as manifestly by the sudden thaws they occasion in Winter, as by their parching heat in Summer.</P>
<P>IT must be confessed, a great change has taken place in the Diseases of this part of the Country, as well of the hot as cold sea∣son of the year. I can remember when re∣gular Intermittents chiefly abounded in the Summer and Fall, and simply Inflammatory
<PB N="219" REF="024239_0225_0FC56E4AF10C88A8"/>
Fevers in the Winter. These now give place to severe Bilious Vomitings, and continued or Remitting Fevers in the Fall, and Synochous and Typhous Fevers in the Winter. For∣merly we used Tartar Emetic more freely and to greater advantage than we can at pre∣sent. Then, too, the Antiphlogistic method of treating Fevers served us well enough; now we have very little use for the Lancet.</P>
<P>OUR Bilious Vomitings are best treated by washing out the Stomach with warm demul∣cent Liquors, then quieting all disturbance with Anodynes, and finishing the cure with Aromatics, Bark, and other Tonic Medicines.</P>
<P>OUR Bilious and Remitting Fevers re∣quire evacuations more or less, have their exacerbations much relieved by Anodynes, and finally yield to the Bark.</P>
<P>IN the Cholera Infantum every irritat∣ing Medicine taken into the Stomach
<PB N="220" REF="024239_0226_0FC56E4EE1C91BE0"/>
is injurious. To wash out the Stomach with Chamomile Tea and Chicken Water, is all the evacuation that can be attempted with advantage. Small doses of Laudanum in the day and full doses at night, become then the sovereign remedy. Bark and Camphor are most advantageously applied to the skin: But nothing more than a palliative cure can be expected, without removing the Patient, from the noxious Air that first gave the Bi∣lious impression. For otherwise, if not killed outright, the Patient must languish under the repeated recurrence of the disorder, with such respites now and then as may be barely termed remissions, until the cold weather has made an entire change in the Atmosphere. In this case, therefore, we have recourse to the Bay Shore; and it is surprising the effects of snuffing the sea breeze for a single day. At Lewes I never heard of the Cholera Infan∣tum; while at Dover it has for years past, swept off our children in a manner that is scarcely credible elsewhere. This puts the efficacy of the sea air in a strong point of
<PB N="221" REF="024239_0227_0FC56E5036C6E748"/>
view; and I mention it that others may pro∣fit by our experience and observation.</P>
<P>THE Fever most prevalent with us in Win∣ter, is precisely that described by D. Cullen, under the name of Synochus. Its first attack is generally attended with aching pains all over, and very often with considerable Pul∣monic affections. Another local affection that often attends it is the Enteritis. The Symptoms that give us the earliest and surest warning of its true Type, are Headach and sickness at the Stomach. Gentle evacuations of the Stomach and Bowels are proper in the beginning; but Antimonials are to be used with caution. For the removal of local af∣fections, we rely chiefly upon Blisters. The Lancet is never used but upon extraordinary and pressing occasions. Languor and weak∣ness soon come on, and we watch the first opportunity of giving the Bark. The most free and liberal use of this important remedy is, at any time or Stage of the Disorder,
<PB N="222" REF="024239_0228_0FC56E54360D18E0"/>
warranted by a dry Tongue. Opium, Wine, Camphor, Volatiles, and all manner of sti∣mulants are often employed in the course of the disorder, as necessary auxiliaries of the Bark. As soon as the Typhous form is cor∣rectly marked, the most cordial and nourish∣ing diet is always used.</P>
<P>NUMEROUS observations persuade us, that our Typhous Fevers are more contagious than is generally apprehended. It is re∣markable that more or less of a family will be affected in succession, when a Fever of this sort is introduced among them, accor∣ding to the care observed in cleanliness and a free ventilation. The Typhus, therefore, is peculiarly noxious to negro families. It is so common to trace infection from one person to another, that the requisite care to guard the family and visiting friends from contagi∣on, is among the earliest and most importu∣nate instructions of our Physicians to their Patients.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="024239_0229_0FC56E55A98476B8"/>
THE swelling of the Spleen and other vis∣ceral obstructions, are best relieved by aperi∣ent Gumous Medicines taken at the same time with Bitters, Aromatics and Tonics, and continued for a length of time. But a Pa∣tient once impressed with this kind of habit, is only to be secured from repeated relapses, by a change of Climate.</P>
<P>WE have incidental disorders in common with other people. But I suppose those only which are special and peculiar to our State to be to your purpose. These I have endea∣voured to describe in a cursory way, as well as my time and state of health will per∣mit.</P>
<P>THE census of the inhabitants of this State, taken for the first time, is not yet com∣pleted; but I have reason to think it will a∣mount to not less than seventy five thousand.

<HEAD>An ACCOUNT of the SITUA∣TION, CLIMATE, and DIS∣EASES of MARYLAND.</HEAD>
<P>THIS State is in length 134 Miles, and in breadth 110; is bounded North by Pennsylvania, East by the Delaware State, South East and South by the Atlantic Ocean; and by Virginia on the South and West; and is between 37° 56′ and 39° 44′ North Lati∣tude, and 4° 30′ West, Longitude from Phi∣ladelphia.</P>
<P>DIVIDED into the Eastern and Western Divisions by the Chesapeake Bay, which re∣ceives a number of the largest Rivers in the United States. The Rivers, however, which run through this State are commonly small, except the rapid Susquehanna, and the Pa∣tomac;
<PB N="226" REF="024239_0232_0FC56E61109915A0"/>
the latter of which is the boundary between it and Virginia.</P>
<P>EAST of the Blue Ridge of Mountains, which stretches across the Western part of this State, the Land, like that in all the Southern States, is generally level and free from Stones; of course the Soil must be si∣milar, as well as the generality of its natural productions.</P>
<P>THE Houses of the Inhabitants, who re∣side on Plantations, are often several Miles distant from each other, hence they appear to live very retired and unsocial lives; and if we may be allowed to judge of the dispositi∣on and manners of Men from the expression of their countenances, the generality of them live dissatisfied and disconsolate.</P>
<P>THE behaviour of the People remote from towns, excluded from social intercourse, and the exchange of friendly offices, is expressive
<PB N="227" REF="024239_0233_0FC56E6233BB1A60"/>
of indolence, and the most consumate ab∣sence and indifference.</P>
<P>THOUGH Annapolis is the capital of the State, it is much inferior to Baltimore in respect to numbers and commercial advanta∣ges. The number of Inhabitants in Anna∣polis does not exceed 2000; in Baltimore there are above 15000.</P>
<P>DR. NUTTER gives the following ac∣count of the Diseases which occur on the Eastern Shore of Maryland.</P>
<P>"THE Diseases which particularly infest the lower extremity of the Eastern Shore of Maryland are, in the Winter, the Syno∣chus or the Typhoid Fever of Doctor Cullen. We have instances of Fevers with genuine Inflammatory Symptoms in this place, but these are not very common. Prac∣titioners
<PB N="228" REF="024239_0234_0FC56E63AEF911F8"/>
are so well aware of this, that they seldom use the Lancet freely."</P>
<P>"I HAVE observed that Fevers commencing with Inflammatory Symptoms soon go off, and leave the Patient in a state of great debi∣lity, with other Symptoms resembling the Typhus. These are observed to be very common in the Month of February, parti∣cularly after a general thaw."</P>
<P>"THE ground is uniformly level and low in most of the Counties on the Eastern Shore, and consequently in many places covered with stagnant Water, except where it is in∣tersected with numerous Creeks. Here are also very large tracts of Marsh in this place, which load the Atmosphere with vapour in the day time, that falls down again in form of dew in the night in the after part of Summer."</P>
<Q><PB N="229" REF="024239_0235_0FC56E67B8CA1DD0"/>
<P>THE vernal and Summer Seasons afford the Inhabitants a respite from Disease.</P>
<P>THE few that do occur at these seasons are similar to those of more Northern Latitudes, but for the most part milder. The Cholera Morbus and Dysentery, however, are very prevalent during part of the Summer, espe∣cially after extraordinary hot weather.</P>
<P>THE Inhabitants dread the approach of Autumn; and with reason, because at this Season Intermittents, Remittents, Diarrhaeas and Dysenteries prevail with astonishing vio∣lence, and frequently extend their ravage far and wide.</P></Q>
<P>"THE ravages of the Influenza in 1789, were particularly observable in Caroline County, which place is also subject to the Diseases abovementioned in an extraordinary degree."</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="024239_0236_0FC56E68EF279050"/>
BY an account received from a Physician residing at Baltimore, it appears, that Dysen∣teries always become epidemical, or very fre∣quent, there in the Autumnal Season, when cold and wet weather succeeds a long course of that which has been hot and dry.</P>
<P>"THE Symptoms are generally slightly Inflammatory at the beginning, and yield to gentle Laxatives and diluting mild aqueous Drinks, and fomentations to the Abdomen; after which small Doses of Anodynes, com∣bined with Tartar Emetic, complete the cure; and a relapse is prevented by exhibiting the Bark combined with a mild Aromatic."</P>
<P>THIS corresponds in a great measure with the observations of Hillary, in his account of the Diseases of Barbadoes, who says, in Page 203, Edition 2d. "I have always found from the best observations that I could make, on the variations of the Air and Weather in this Island, that if the Months of May, June, July, and August were very hot and dry, and
<PB N="231" REF="024239_0237_0FC56E6CE728EAE8"/>
the following Months of September, Octo∣ber, and November were accompanied with much Rain, so that the Air was rendered cool and damp, and if the intermediate days between the rainy ones were very hot, that Dysenteries were very frequent and Epide∣mical, and were generally more or less ma∣lignant, as the abovementioned changes of the Weather were greater or less, more sud∣den or more gradual, and shorter or of lon∣ger duration.</P>
<P>IT appears from the observations of Hil∣lary, that Dysenteries constantly return eve∣ry year in the West-Indies with the Perio∣dical Rains; hence it may be concluded, that cold and moisture operating on the Body in a certain State of Relaxation, are the principal causes of this Disease. From these and other circumstances, I am inclined to think the Dysentery is never an infectious Dis∣ease or communicable from one to another, except when combined with the putrid or Typhous Fever; and that Dr. Cullen has been
<PB N="232" REF="024239_0238_0FC56E6FB4DB99D8"/>
mistaken in ascribing it to specific infection; but that it is generally, if not always, owing to the joint operation of Marsh Miasmata and external cold, or is the effect of human Contagion operating on the System, when the Intestines are in a relaxed and Atonic State.</P>
<P>Extract of a Letter from another Corres∣pondent, residing on the Eastern Shore of Maryland.</P>
<Q><P>OUR Summer and Autumnal Wea∣ther of one Year varies so little from that of another, that the same Distempers return so regularly with the Seasons, that they may be considered as Endemic. These succeed each other in the following order.</P>
<P>TOWARDS the end of July, young chil∣dren (which I believe suffer first by excessive heat or cold in every Climate) are attacked with the Cholera, or a Bilious Diarrhaea.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="233" REF="024239_0239_0FC56E712FDB7318"/>
IN the following Month, Remittents, a∣long the low moist country, are very general, and continue to increase daily till after the Autumnal Equinox, when they are succeeded by Quotidian and a Tertian Agues. Dysen∣teries sometimes occur here; but I do not re∣collect the situations in which they are most common, neither have I seen a sufficient number of cases to be able to inform you of the method of treating them which succeeds best—But this I can say, that the genera∣lity of the Practitioners in the District where I reside, never puzzle their heads with the investigation of Causes, but depend upon the Store of Recipes recorded in Brooke's Practice of Physic, or Buchan's Family Physician.—If they succeed they are satis∣fied; if they fail, they console themselves with the most confident assurance, that every thing has been done secundum artem.</P>
<P>CHILDREN are often afflicted with a severe kind of Apthae here in the Autumn and early
<PB N="234" REF="024239_0240_0FC56E761B0AED88"/>
part of Winter, which often renders them scarcely able to swallow any kind of suste∣nance. This appears to be owing to a de∣fective perspiration, and a relaxed state of the solids. And the remedies which I have found most speedy in removing it, has been the Warm-bath, Flannel Cloathing, and the Cortex in different forms; and I particularly enjoin removal to the high dry Country, for the benefit of purer Air.</P>
<P>I have many times seen the Cholera, with regular periods like a Tertian, and the parox∣ism of Tertians, attended with a Cholera. In a few Cases I have seen a Tertian changed into the Dysentery, and Dysenteries into Tertians; and when one of these diseases has been suppressed, the other has sometimes ensued. I have also been told by other Practiti∣oners, that it is very common for Dysenteries to put on the form of Tertians, and for the fits of Tertians to be regularly accompanied by gripes and stools.</P>

"From the accounts of Sir John Pringle and Dr. Monro, this disease appears to be contagious in Camps and Hospitals; but I believe there are no proofs of its being so in private practice."</P>
<P>The following account of the situation and Diseases of George-Town was commu∣nicated by Dr. W. Martin.—</P>
<Q><P>GEORGE-TOWN is situate on the Banks of the River Patowmac, about an hundred and sixty miles from its entrance into the Chesapeake Bay. The ground on which it stands is very broken, being a cluster of num∣berless little hills, and which, though they at present lie very high above the surface of the River, have probably at some remote period been overflowed, as at the distance of eight or ten feet from the surface, marine shells have been found. There are no Dis∣eases that I can obtain information of, or have met with myself, that can be consider∣ed
<PB N="236" REF="024239_0242_0FC56E78B0DC8798"/>
as peculiar to this place. No Endemics, nor any Epidemics, except occasionally in∣troduced from other parts and propagated by contagion or infection. There are no marshy grounds nor stagnant waters near it. The country, though not in high cultivation, is yet sufficiently cleared to favour the salutary effects of free ventilation.</P>
<P>THE State of Society here, as it is not favourable to agreeable social intercourse, so also there are none of those complaints to be met with that arise from a too free use of the <HI>bottle,</HI> or excessive eating (I speak of the bet∣ter class of people). On the other hand, the meagre Diet, chiefly <HI>Indian bread</HI> and salted fish, together with the insatiable desire for <HI>Rum,</HI> and a want of cleanliness among the lower ranks, often give rise to Diseases of extreme Debility; and to a cutaneous dis∣ease (which if any disease is endemic from its general prevalency this is) called the Itch (Psora).</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="024239_0243_0FC56E7DC051ECA8"/>
IN short, the state of diseases are so nearly similar to those with you, that it is scarce necessary to enumerate them. In the Win∣ter and Spring we have Pneumonia, Rheu∣matism, Sore-throat (Cynanche Tonsilaris) Catarrh, &amp;c. In the Summer Cholera and Diarrhoea. In Autumn, now and then a case of Remittent; Intermittents less fre∣quently.</P>
<P>IN the Cure even of inflammatory Dis∣eases, we find more success in moderate and frequent than in copious Venaesection. Our greater position to the Southward than you, the longer continuance of our heat in Sum∣mer, as well as of its greater intenseness, ren∣ders the Bodies of the inhabitants more re∣laxed, and consequently more disposed to dis∣eases of debility, such as Idiopathic Fevers and Diarrhoeas, than in more northern lati∣tudes, and certainly occasions the symptoms in phlogistic cases to be more mild.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="024239_0244_0FC56E8038114580"/>
UPON the whole, George-Town and its vicinity, may be considered as a healthy part of America; and in any disputes about the propriety of the seat of the General Govern∣ment being fixed here, no objection can be urged against it on account of its Diseases.</P></Q>
<P>DR. JOHN SHAFF acquaints the Author, that Annapolis the Capital of Maryland "is probably one of the most salutary situations on the Continent, the number of inhabitants small, that he rarely meets with any but spo∣radic Cases of Typhus, and that their other Fevers are mostly of the Intermitting, Remit∣ting, and inflammatory Type."</P>
<P>DR. JOHNSTON, of Baltimore, informs that he has met with numerous Cases of Dysentery in situations out of the reach of Marsh Miasmata.</P>
<P>IN the Diarrhoea of Children he is of opi∣nion, that Dentition, if not the Cause of the
<PB N="239" REF="024239_0245_0FC56E81F1C3CEA0"/>
Disease, has a great share in aggravating it, by increasing the irritability of the System. The Thebaic Tincture in small doses; Alum, Com. dissolved in spring water, coloured with Coccinella so as to give a grain in a tea spoonful, is the usual dose and manner in which I give that medicine, after every loose stool, to a child of six or eight months old to a year, and increase it in proportion to the age. To women with the same complaint, who give suck, and in many cases of Dysen∣tery, after clearing the Primae Viae with Ipecacuanha, I give Allum. Com. from five to ten grains, with as many drops of Thebaic Tincture. I direct infants of all ages to be bathed in cold water, if the weather is hot, either by a partial application of it to the head and shoulders, or by immersion; after which they are rubbed dry, and wrapped up in flannels, to bring a glow of heat to the surface, and promote the good effects of that reaction, which the sudden application of cold rarely fails to produce.</P>

<HEAD>Extract of a Letter, dated Dorchester, Febru∣ary 18th, 1790.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER giving a similar account of the Diseases more of less epidemic at parti∣cular Seasons with those already inserted, a Physician whose name I have not permis∣sion to mention, informs me, that Dropsical Cases are very frequent in that part of the country where he practises; and that he has been generally successful in curing them by
<PB N="241" REF="024239_0247_0FC56E87AF645EB8"/>
the Digitalis in decoction, which he prefers to the powder.—For particulars he refers to a paper on the Dropsy by Erasmus Darwin, published in the Medical Transactions of the London College of Physicians; of which the following is a copy.</P>
<Q><P>BOIL of the fresh green leaves of the Di∣gitalis Purpurea, or Fox-glove, 40z. in com∣mon water from two pints to one, and add to the strained liquid of vinous spirit, 20z.</P>
<P>OF this Decoction one large table spoon∣ful is to be given early in the morning, in every variety of Idiopathic Dropsy, whether in the form of Hydrocephalus, Hydrothorax, A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cites, or Anasarca; and should be repeated every hour till the Patient has taken from three to eight or nine spoonfuls, or till sick∣ness or some other disagreeable sensation is induced.</P></Q>
<P>THE Hydropic fluid generally disappears
<PB N="242" REF="024239_0248_0FC56E8B8D006268"/>
on the next day, or on the third day, with∣out any repetition of the medicine, and fre∣quently without any apparently increased evacuation; at other times, with Vomiting and a large flow of Urine, and sometimes with purging stools.</P>
<P>To some whose constitutions appeared to be robuster, the dose was increased to half or a whole spoonful more, if the first two or three single spoonfuls occasioned no nausea. But as some of these Patients complained of very great debility during its operation, it was judged more prudent to use rather an under than an excessive dose. In some, who had been two or three times relieved by the same method in the space of eight or ten months, a less quantity was found to succeed: To these, half an ounce of the decoction, mixed with an ounce of simple Pepperment-water, or with a decoction of Bark and Snake-root, was given twice or thrice a-day, for two or three successive days.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="024239_0249_0FC56E8CF01A1258"/>
ON the day after the exhibition of the Digitalis, or on the third day, or as soon as the sickness occasioned by it ceased, an infu∣sion of the stem leaves of Artichoke, or a strong Decoction of the Bark, with a small quantity of some Chalybeate Medicine, (of which I give the preference to the Flores Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tiales, from two to six grains, or in lieu of this, the Vitriol Martis, or common Cop∣peras, as it is improperly called, from one quarter of a grain to two grains, dissolved in some Aromatic Water, or mixed with Syrup of Ginger) was generally given twice a-day. and one grain of Opium every night, with as much Rhubarb or Aloes as occasioned a stool next day. This quantity of Opium was persisted in for some weeks, without increase or diminution, as it seemed to be particularly serviceable.</P>
<P>THE convalescent Patients were allowed to eat flesh Meats, if their Stomachs could bear it, twice or thrice a-day, and also Shell-Fish
<PB N="244" REF="024239_0250_0FC56E8F32EEC1E0"/>
and Eggs, Spiceries and aromatic Vegetables, particulary Cellery and Water-cresses, Pepper∣grass, &amp;c. They were also advised to drink half the quantity of any Liquor to which they had formerly been accustomed, except of distilled Spirits, which was always pro∣hibited, except where Dypeptic symptoms rendered them really necessary.</P>
<Q><P>IT is observable, that when a sufficient dose of the Foxglove Decoction is given at first to produce the effect desired, a much less quantity will have the same effect after∣wards. This I suppose is owing to the faci∣lity our Constitutions possess of acquiring habits of action after having been excited by adapted stimuli.</P>
<P>☞ THUS if ten grains of Aloes be at first exhibited as a Cathartic, the dose may be gra∣dually decreased to one grain, and it will still produce the same effect, the constitution having acquired a habit of obeying its sti∣mulus.
<PB N="245" REF="024239_0251_0FC56E90AF160038"/>
On the contrary, if one grain of Aloes be at first exhibited, and does not Purge the Patient, it may be increased by slow degrees to twenty grains without prov∣ing Cathartic.</P>
<P>HENCE Drunkards who begin with large quantities of strong Liquors, become at last intoxicated with small ones; while those who do not quite inebriate themselves daily, will be enabled at length to quaff whole gal∣lons without intoxication.</P>
<P>I BELIEVE the Hydrocephalus Inter∣nus is more frequent with us than with you; and am of the same opinion with you, that it is often present when the Patient's eyes are not affected with Strabismus. I believe Whytt and Fothergill have both given accu∣rate descriptions of the Disease as it fre∣quently appears; the former having only ob∣served it in a Chronic state, the latter in an Acute one.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="024239_0252_0FC56E94A14401A8"/>
I THINK the inference drawn by Quin from the case he dissected, in which he found marks of Inflammation instead of Water in the ventricles of the Brain, should have no weight.</P>
<P>I HAVE seen more than twenty cases of this disease, the greatest part of which died of it. I have taken particular pains to enquire into the rise and progress of the symptoms of every one that ever came under my notice, and I have now been in practice in different parts of Maryland thirty-four years; but have ne∣ver met with a single case where the disease was immediately preceded by an inflamma∣tion of the Brain, or its investing Mem∣branes.</P>
<P>BUT whatever be its remote or occasional causes, its proximate cause is are laxed or a∣tonic state of the Exhalents which terminate, and of the Absorbents which originate in the ventricles of the Brain.</P>

THIS complaint has often been mistaken for symptoms supposed to be occasioned by Worms. That Worms may, and sometimes do, occasion Convulsions in very debilitated and irritable constitutions, by the irritation they are capable of giving, I have no doubt; but I believe they seldom occasion either Fever or Delirium; at least, I have never seen a case where, I think, those symptoms could be fairly ascribed to these reptiles. I have opened several Negro Children here, who were supposed to have died of what is erroneously called the Worm Fever; but in∣stead of meeting with any Worms, have fre∣quently found Tubercles and small Vomicas in their Lungs, of which there was no suspi∣cion while alive.</P></Q>
<P>OUR Planters, who are generally hard Drinkers, are frequently afflicted with the Rheumatism as they advance in years. This, though frequently accompanied with phlo∣gistic Diathesis at first, soon degenerates
<PB N="248" REF="024239_0254_0FC56E9B1633EDF0"/>
into the opposite extreme, and depends upon an atonic state of the Muscular Fibres. Under such circumstances, the stimulus of external heat, confined by flannel clothing next to the the skin, a strong decoction of the Cortex and Serpentaria, with the moderate use of Brandy and Water, and the moderate and regular use of Animal matter, in form of Soups and Jel∣lies, the occasional use of Opium, to mitigate Pain, seldom fail to cure the disease; where∣as Purging and Abstinence never fail to prolong it, especially when Chronic and free from Phlogistic Diathesis.</P>
<P>THAT Dysenteries do not always depend upon Contagion, appears from this, that they often occur here in rainy weather in Febru∣ary, at least we have Diarrhoeas, accompanied with Tenesmus, and preceded by a cold stage, or frequent thrilling sensations, and all the other characteristic symptoms described by Dr. Cullen, which generally yield to the treatment and medicines he recommends.</P>
<Q><PB N="249" REF="024239_0255_0FC56E9CB2EE48C8"/>
<P>WHEN the Gout occurs, I treat it in the very same manner as I do the different sta∣ges of Rheumatism; and am of opinion, that Sydenham's erroneous theory has retarded our improvement in medicine, particularly in the cure of this disease, more than all other circumstances put together.</P>
<P>WHERE the pulse, pain and heat indicate, I bleed and purge without reserve, and en∣join the antiphlogistic regimen; where these symptoms are absent, and symptoms of debi∣lity, and loss of appetite, or sickness at sto∣mach is distressing, I as freely and without reserve, have recourse to small and repeat∣ed doses of Laudanum, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound and pure Wine, Blisters, the Hot-bath and Flannel Cloathing; and when in a convalescent state, Decoctions of Bark, Snake-root, and the ar∣tificially made Mineral Waters, impreg∣nated with fixed Air, (for which purpose I have provided myself with Nooth's Ma∣chine) with exercise, and regular but not abstemious living.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="024239_0256_0FC56EA1C2BB5740"/>
PEOPLE who declaim against the use of Spirituous Liquors, should always con∣sider climate and situation. In cold or even temperate climates I believe they may gene∣rally be dispensed with; but that man must be a superficial observer, who condemns the moderate use of them, when relaxed by the intense and long continued Summer heats of this climate, or in any climate, when ex∣hausted by fatiguing exercise.</P>
<P>THEY are particularly necessary to prevent Dyspepsia, where much vegetable and little animal matter is used.</P>
<P>THE insensibility of the System is asto∣nishing, in many cases of Hydrocephalus Internus; I have frequently given four grains of the best Calomel for four successive days, three times a-day, to Children of three or four years of age, without producing any sen∣sible effect; and when it does operate, it is generally by stool, seldom or ever, except
<PB N="251" REF="024239_0257_0FC56EA56535C990"/>
when combined with Opium, upon the Sali∣vary Glands of young children.</P>
<P>I THINK I have seen five or six marked cases of this Disease cured by persisting in its use, and supporting the Patient with, Vi∣nous Drink, and a liquid cordial Diet; Blis∣ters might be applied to the Head or Neck, at the same time as coinciding with the in∣tention of the other remedies.</P>
<P>WHEN Friction is employed, it ought to be used in four times the quantity that might be requisite in almost any other Disease, be∣cause of the extraordinary insensibility to its stimulus in this.</P>
<P>AS you have Dobson's communications on this subject, and can see the sentiments of others in Duncan's Commentaries, I shall trouble you no farther with my imperfect thoughts on the subject at present; but I
<PB N="252" REF="024239_0258_0FC56EA6856FA5B8"/>
cannot prevail on myself to conclude, with∣out a short animadversion on the new and inconsistent Doctrine taught and published by the late Dr. Brown of Edinburgh. This man (whose talents I admire, and if he had employed them in the service of truth, I should have venerated) has had the presumption to assert, that there is not a direct Sedative in nature. What then are the contagions which produce different spe∣cies of Idiopathic Fever, Dysentery, and Pestilence? If the primary operation of these is to produce weakness, are they not direct Sedatives in the strictest sense of the term. Does their operation consist in the privation or abstraction of Stimuli? (which they ought to do consistent with one of the funda∣mental principles of this Doctrine). By no means.—Do they produce their effects by their exciting power, wasting the exci∣tability, and producing weakness of the indirect kind by that means?—Surely no, for they are assisted in their effects by
<PB N="253" REF="024239_0259_0FC56EA806F62E48"/>
Hunger, Cold, Grief, which are privations or abstractions of stimulant powers. On the contrary, their effects are retarded or counter∣acted by Stimulant Powers. These Con∣tagions operate slowly, and the Patient feels indisposition for several days before he is seized with Fever.</P>
<P>WINE induces indirect weakness, but the System is first excessively stimulated.</P>
<P>BY simply drawing into the Lungs a con∣siderable portion of fixed Air, issuing from any fermenting liquor, a heathy man is instantly killed, whereas if the atmosphere, or the de∣phlogisticated Air, which forms the greatest portion of it be excluded for several minutes, he is not deprived of life; but if animation or motion, the effects of animation, be sus∣pended thereby, he may generally be restored by inflating his Lungs with pure atmospheric Air again.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="024239_0260_0FC56EAD360E8040"/>
THIS has been fully proved by the experiments of the late ingenious Dr. Ed∣mond Goodwin, in his Essay on the Connection of Life with Respiration; from whence it appears, that the generality of drowned persons may be restored to life by the application of external heat to the body, gradually applied, till it equals that of an inflammatory Fever, or 112 degrees of Fahrenheit's Thermometer; after which, and not before, the Lungs are to be inflated by a pair of bellows, passed into one of the nos∣trils, giving five or six blasts successively, and then intermitting half a minute or more, to observe the effect, &amp;c.</P>
<P>IN order to produce the requisite heat, the Hot-bath is the best means; but when that cannot be procured, the Patient should be laid on hot salt, or ashes, which should be convered with a woollen blanket, and himself covered with three or four others, well-heated. Heated Salt, Ashes, or Sand in Woollen Bags, or Jugs of boiling Water, es∣pecially
<PB N="255" REF="024239_0261_0FC56EAEDE8994C8"/>
the latter, being applied to or near his feet at the same time." Excuse me for trans∣cribing what I am sure you have often perused in the work at large.</P>
<P>TO conclude, the fair deduction from the Doctrine of Mr. Brown, is, that, as no Disease can survive its Cause, it must cease of necessity in all Cases where the excitement is to excess, as soon as that excessive excite∣ment is reduced by the abstraction of Stimu∣lant Powers to a certain point at which Health is supposed to rest; and that in all cases of Debility, where the excitement is below the healthy point of the imaginary Scale, it must also necessarily cease so soon as a sufficient number of Stimuli have been applied, as the System must be thereby raised to that point; or if too violent Stimuli be applied, so as to raise the excitement beyond that point, it will be changed into a Disease of the opposite nature and form.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="024239_0262_0FC56EB25AA482C8"/>
AS it is the duty of every one to point out such errors as have a tendency to mislead, or prove injurious, I hope you will pardon me for digressing so wide from the object of your enquiries, and believe me to be, &amp;c.</P></Q>

<HEAD>A SKETCH OF THE SITUATION, APPEARANCE, AND CLIMATE OF VIRGINIA.</HEAD>
<P>THIS State is in Length 758 Miles, and in Breath 224; between 36° 30′, and 40° North Latitude, &amp;c.</P>
<P>BOUNDED East, by the Atlantic Ocean; North by Pennsylvania and the river Ohio; West by the Missisippi; and South by North-Carolina.</P>
<P>EAST of the Blue Ridge of Mountains, the Land is level and low, like that of Mary∣land.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="024239_0264_0FC56EB80BA045C8"/>
THE Mountains in this State commence about 150 Miles from the Sea-Coast, and are disposed in Ridges, one behind ano∣ther, running nearly parallel with the Sea Coast.</P>
<P>THE Alleghany is the great Ridge which divides the waters of the Atlantic from those of the Missisippi; its summit is doubtless more elevated above the Ocean than any other Mountain: But its relative height compared with the base on which it stands, is not so great as that of some others.</P>
<P>THE Mountains of the Blue Ridge (and of these the Peaks of OTTER, are thought to be of greater height, measured from their base) are higher than any others in Virginia, or perhaps in North-America. The highest Peak is said to be 4000 feet perpendicular, which is not a fifth part of the height of the

<Q><P>There are several Medicinal Springs in Virginia. The most efficacious of these are, two Springs in Augusta, near the first sources of James river, where it is called Jackson's River.</P>
<P>They rise near the foot of the Ridge of Mountains generally called the Warm Spring
<PB N="260" REF="024239_0266_0FC56EBACF551838"/>
Mountains, but in the Maps, Jackson's Moun∣tains. The one is distinguished by the name of the <HI>Warm Spring,</HI> and the other the <HI>Hot Spring.</HI> The Warm Spring issues with a very bold stream, sufficient to work a grist-mill, and to keep the waters of its bason, which is 30 feet in diameter, at the vital warmth, viz. of 96 de∣grees. The matter with which these waters are allied is very volatile; its smell indicates it to be sulphureous, as also does the circum∣stance of its turning silver black. It rains here four or five days in almost every week. The <HI>Hot Spring,</HI> which is about six miles from the Warm, is much smaller. It raises the Mercury in Fahrenheit's Thermometer to 112 degrees, which is fever heat. A fountain of common water issuing within a few inches of its margin, gives it a singu∣lar appearance. Comparing the temperature of these with that of the hot springs of Cam∣schatka, of which Krachininnikow gives an account, the difference is very great, the latter raising the Mercury to 200 degrees, which is within 12 of boiling water.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="024239_0267_0FC56EBFFA0823E0"/>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These Springs have been analyzed by James Madison, Esq. by which it appears that they have been falsely called sweet, their taste being evidently acidulous.

Their taste re∣sembles exactly that of Waters artificially impregnated with fixed air, extricated from Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lk by means of Vitriolic Acid, and is nearly the same with the true Pyrmont Waters. Other Experiments show, that these Waters contain neither Sulp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣nor Iron.

These are as cold as common spring water.</P>
<P>On the Patowmac river, in Berkley County, above the North Mountains, are Medicinal Springs much more frequented than those of Augusta, though their waters are much weaker mineralized, and scarcely warm.

always safe from the Indians, and nearer to more populous States. There is a weak Chalybeate at Richmond, and many others in various parts of the State, but of too little note to be enumerated after these al∣ready mentioned.</P></Q>

<HEAD>CLIMATE.</HEAD>
<Q><P>IN this extensive State it is not to be expected, that the Climate should be the same in all its parts.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that proceeding in the same parallel of latitude westwardly, the Climate becomes colder in like manner, as well as when you proceed northwardly.</P>
<P>THIS continues to be the case till you attain the summit of the Alleghany, which is the highest land between the ocean and the Missisippi. From thence descending in the same latitude to the Missisippi, the change
<PB N="263" REF="024239_0269_0FC56EC535BBEBA0"/>
reverses; and if we may believe travellers, it becomes warmer there than it is in the same latitude on the Sea-side. Their testimony is strengthened by the vegetables and animals which subsist and multiply there naturally, which do not on the Sea Coast.</P>
<P>Catalpas grow spontaneously on the Missi∣sippi as far as the latitude of 37°, and Reeds as far as 38°. Paroquets, even Winter, in the Scioto in the 39th degree of latitude.</P></Q>
<Q><P>The difference of temperature in the Air at the Sea Coast, or the Chesapeake-Bay, and at the Alleghany has not been ascertained; but cotemporary observations made at Wil∣liamsburgh, or in its neighbourhood, and at Monticello, the latter of which is situated nearly central between the Bay and Allegha∣ny, or between the Southern and Northern Boundaries of the State, may be considered as furnishing the best average of the tempe∣rature of its Climate. These Observations
<PB N="264" REF="024239_0270_0FC56ECA5E012AE8"/>
make the difference between Williamsburgh and Monticello, to be on an average 6 1/8 de∣grees of Fahrenheit's Thermometer.</P>
<P>WILLIAMSBURGH is much too near the South-East Corner to give a fair idea of the general temperature.</P>
<P>BUT a more remarkable difference is in the Winds which prevail in the different parts of the Country.</P></Q>
<P>FROM Mr. Jefferson's Meteorological Tables it appears, that the South-West Wind prevails equally at Williamsburg and Monti∣cello; that the North-East is next to this the principal Wind towards the Sea-Coast, and the North-West is the predominant Wind at the Mountains. The difference between these two Winds to sensation, and in fact, is very great; the North-East is loaded with vapour, inso∣much that the Salt Manufacturers have found that their chrystals would not shoot
<PB N="265" REF="024239_0271_0FC56ECB42A7BFA0"/>
while that blows, it occasions a distressing chill, and a heaviness and oppression of the spirits. The North-West is dry, cooling, elastic, and animating. The Eastern and South-Eastern breezes come on generally in the afternoon. They have advanced into the country very sensibly within the memory of people now living. As the lands become more cleared, it is probable that they will ex∣tend still farther Westward. The farther they extend into the Country, the less moist they become, as they deposit it in their pro∣gress.</P>
<Q><P>The variation in the weight of the At∣mosphere, as indicated by the Barometer, is not equal to two inches of Mercury. Dur∣ing twelve months observation at Williams∣burg, the extremes were 29 and 30.86 in∣ches, the difference being 1.86 of an inch; and in nine months, during which the height of the Mercury was noted at Mon∣ticello, the extremes were 28.48 and 29.69
<PB N="266" REF="024239_0272_0FC56ECE9D52AEF0"/>
inches, the variation being 1.21 of an inch. A Gentleman, says Mr. Jefferson, who has observed his Barometer many years assures me it has never varied two inches.</P>
<P>Cotemporary Observations, made at Monticello and Williamsburgh, proved the variation in the weight of the Air, to be simultaneous and corresponding in these two places<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If these Observations are accurate, Monticello must be at an equal height from the level of the Ocean with Williams∣burgh, for the Mercury in the Barometer falls one-tenth of an inch for every 90 feet perpendicular, that we ascend above that level.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE changes from Heat to Cold, and Cold to Heat, are very sudden and great. The Mercury has been known to descend from 92° to 47° in thirteen hours.</P>

<P>AT Williamsburgh, in August 1777, the Mercury in Farenheit's Thermometer was at 98°, coresponding with 29½ of Reaumur. At the same place, in January 1780, it was 6°. corresponding to 11½ below o of Reau∣mur. I believe these may be considered as the extremes of Heat and Cold in that part of the country. The latter may most cer∣tainly, as at that time York River at York∣town was frozen over, so that people walked across it; a circumstance which proves it to
<PB N="268" REF="024239_0274_0FC56ED4AC7E03C0"/>
have been colder than the Winter of 1740-1, usually called the <HI>hard</HI> Winter, when York River did not freeze over at that place. In the same season of 1780, Chesapeake-Bay was solid from its head to the mouth of Pa∣towmac.</P>
<P>AT Annapolis where it is 5¼ miles over be∣tween the nearest points of land, the ice was from five to seven inches thick quite across, so that loaded carriages went over on it.</P>
<P>THOSE extremes of Heat and Cold, at 6° and 98°, Mr. Jefferson observes, were in∣deed very distressing, and were thought to put the human constitution to the extent of trial. Yet, continues the same respectable Author, a Siberian would have considered them as scarcely a sensible variation.</P>
<P>AT Jenneseitz, in that country, in latitude 58° 27′, we are told, that the cold in 1735 sunk the Mercury by Farenheit's Scale to
<PB N="269" REF="024239_0275_0FC56ED5CBDE7F78"/>
126° below nought; and the inhabitants of the same country use stove rooms two or three times a week, in which they stay two hours at a time, the Atmosphere of which raises the Mercury to 135° above nothing.</P>
<P>LATE experiments shew, that the human body will live in rooms heated to 347 de∣grees, that is 135°. above boiling water.</P>
<P>THE hottest point of the twenty-four hours is about four o'clock, P. M.; and the dawn of day the coldest.</P>
<P>ON comparing the extremes of Heat and Cold at Williamsburg, with the same at Paris, it appears they are in greater at Paris.</P>
<P>THE access of Frost in Autumn, and its recess in the Spring, do not seem to depend merely on the degree of Cold; much less on the Air's being at the freezing point. That other circumstances must be combined with the Cold to produce Frost, is evident
<PB N="270" REF="024239_0276_0FC56ED7347638B8"/>
from this also, that on the higher parts of Mountains, where it is absolutely colder than in the plains on which they stand, Frosts do appear so early by a considerable space of time in Autumn, and go off sooner in the Spring than on the plains<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the Summer Season, the Vapours by the time they at∣tain to to the height of the Mountains become so attenuated, that they have not sufficient gravity to subside, and form a dew when the Sun retires.</P>
<P><HI>Vid. Jefferson's Notes on Virginia, page 87.</HI></P></NOTE>. This greater privilege a∣gainst the Frost on Mountains, is undoubt∣edly combined with the want of dew there. That the dew is very rare in their higher parts, I may say with certainty, (says Mr. Jefferson) from twelve years observations, having scarcely ever seen during that time, an unequivocal proof of its existence at all on them during Summer.</P>
<P>That unfortunate fluctuation between Heat and Cold, so destructive to Fruit, prevails less in Virginia than in Pennsylvania in the Spring Season; nor is the overflowing of the
<PB N="271" REF="024239_0277_0FC56EDB1AB904C8"/>
Rivers in Virginia so extensive or so frequent at that Season, as those of the New-England States;—because the snows in the former do not lie accumulating all Winter, to be dis∣solved altogether in the Spring, as they do in the latter.</P>
<P>IN Virginia below the Mountains, the Snow seldom lies more than a day or two, and seldom a week; and the large rivers very seldom freeze over. This fluctuation of weather, however, is sufficient to render the Winters and Springs very unwholsome, as the inhabitants have to travel in almost perpetual slop.</P>

<HEAD>Extract of a letter from a Physician at Peters∣burgh, in Virginia, dated December 8th, 1790.</HEAD>
<Q><P>IN the Winter and Spring, reckoning from January to the Summer Solstice, our epidemic Diseases are principally Rheuma∣tisms and Catarrhs; seldom any genuine Pleurisy, but a spurious and complicated kind is very common, accompanied with great
<PB N="272" REF="024239_0278_0FC56EE006A37A68"/>
prostration of strength, Sickness, and Vomit∣ing, Coma or Comatose Delirium, as well as pain in the Thorax, Cough, and difficulty of Breathing, and is the most mortal Disease we have, to Adults. The Remedies which the Physicians of this place have found most suc∣cessful in this Disease, have been a repetition of mild Emetics, and the application of Blisters to the Wrists, as well as to the parts affected, and a few Drops of Laudanum, and Antimonial Wine, every three or four hours, in a Draught of Barley Gruel, or Tea made of Linseed and Sage, for the first two or three days after its attack; but if the debi∣lity increases, we find nothing equal to Vola∣tile Alkaline Salts and Wine Whey. Good effects have also been sometimes produced by a Decoction of the Seneca Root, given in such Draughts as to create a slight nausea. Bleeding has been observed to aggravate the Disease so frequently, that the lancet has al∣most fallen into discredit. I however, always venture to open a vein when the pain is acute, and the respiration difficult, and sometimes
<PB N="273" REF="024239_0279_0FC56EE0F165A528"/>
a repetition, but am very cautious in the quan∣tity drawn at once. The lowness of our si∣tuation, and the long continued and excessive heats to which we are subject, render us a∣mazingly infirm, and occasion a Diathesis of so lax a texture, that an inflammatory affec∣tion cannot exist many days without termi∣nating in a gangrene. I have sometimes had thoughts of trying the effects of Mercurial Frictions in this Disease, because of the analogy it bears to the Hepatitis which occurs in hot Climates; but have hitherto been deterred from the attempt, owing to cer∣tain conscientious scruples.</P>
<P>I HAVE sometimes followed the method recommended by Dr. Hamilton, in the ma∣nagement of Inflammatory Diseases, and have given from one to three grains of Calomel, and from one-fourth to a grain of Opium, and as much Tartar Emetic, to which I have sometimes added a few grains of Camphor, made into a Boluss with conserve of Roses,
<PB N="274" REF="024239_0280_0FC56EE278272EE0"/>
every six or eight hours, for several days, accompanied with a Decoction of Seneca, Sarsaparilla, and Liquorice Root, and in some Cases with immediate and evident advan∣tage; but I must ingenuously confess, that the major part of the Cases in which I have employed it, as well as every other Remedy, has hitherto failed with me.</P>
<P>THE extreme weakness and dejection, hinder large and repeated Bleedings, which are the only things capable of removing genuine Inflammations.</P>
<P>FROM the Summer Solstice till after the middle of September, Choleras and Diarr∣hoeas are epidemic here, and are so mor∣tal among Children that it has given rise to a common, but very erroneous notion, that none born here ever arrive to Manhood, whereas I am very certain, that more than two-thirds of the number born here annually, do not die the same year; what proportion
<PB N="275" REF="024239_0281_0FC56EE578564978"/>
arrive to Manhood, I have not been able to ascertain as yet, but shall set about the en∣quiry as soon as I have leisure.</P>
<P>THE Flux commonly occurs about the middle of August, and continues more or less epidemic till the Frost sets in, which is seldom before the middle of October.</P>
<P>THIS Disease does not occur every year; is more common in cool and wet Summers than in warm and dry ones. I am sorry, that it is not in my power to resolve your question about its being infectious; but from the pre∣prevalency of that opinion, and from the ac∣count given by Lind, in his papers on infec∣tion, I am inclined to think it is.</P>
<P>OUR Plan of Cure in this Disease differs considerably from that recommended by Dr. Cullen:—We trust principally to Decoctions of Bark, Snake-root, and Rhubarb, with the liberal use of Opium, and Vinous, or other
<PB N="276" REF="024239_0282_0FC56EE6F2853E28"/>
Spirituous Drinks; and when the debility is great, we employ the Hot-bath, and ap∣ply Rubefacients to the Abdomen and Limbs. This treatment perhaps, in a different situa∣tion, would be improper and injurious; but I declare upon my honour, it seldom fails curing the Disease in this place, where it is punctually adhered to.</P>
<P>OUR Intermitting and Remitting Fevers begin very early in Autumn, and continue to be more or less epidemic till the middle of Win∣ter, especially the former.</P>
<P>In the Cure of the Remitting Fever, we find the bark by no means effectual, without the liberal use of Wine; and in very relaxed habits, we find it necessary to have recourse to Brandy; this last, taken in small quantities, and repeated every hour, without any addition, has succeeded with us in many Cases of Remittent, accompanied with great Dejection of Strength and Depression of Spi∣rits,
<PB N="277" REF="024239_0283_0FC56EEBF2A6C048"/>
when the Bark alone has had every ap∣perance of aggravating the Disease. Hux∣ham's Tincture is considered as a Catholicon.</P>
<P>FROM these circumstances you will be led to think us all Drunkards; this, however, is by no means the case. We live full, and drink freely, but seldom so much as to in∣duce intoxication. But the Heat of our Cli∣mate, and our confined situation, (being shut out from the access of the Winds, by high hills on every side) has such an effect on our Constitutions that they very nearly resemble those of hard Drinkers;—hence, we require a considerable quantity of Stimulating Ali∣ment, and Vinous Drinks, to keep up a ba∣lance between the several functions of the body.</P>
<P>I HAVE never met with any Case of Te∣tanus, but what arose in consequence of a lesion of a nervous part;—and though I have the highest Veneration and esteem for Dr.
<PB N="278" REF="024239_0284_0FC56EED22384100"/>
Rush, whose experience and ingenuity stand unrivalled in our Country, I have never yet had the courage to omit the employment of Opium in large Doses, repeated every 4th, 6th, or 8th hour, while any Spasmodic Symp∣toms remained, along with the liberal use of hot Brandy-Tody, and high seasoned Soup, in which Cayenne Pepper, was a principal Ingredient.</P>
<P>I HAVE read both Sydenham and Brown, and though I think them both eccentric and erroneous in many things, I am convinced a man of judgment may derive instruction from them both.</P></Q>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>COPY of a LETTER from Dr. JAMES LYONS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the honour of receiving your favour of March the 6th, which mentions your having undertaken a Work, the utility
<PB N="279" REF="024239_0285_0FC56EF1B26F77F0"/>
of which has been long impressed on my mind; and the execution of which I once had in contemplation, though on a scale less exten∣sive than the one you propose. It occurred to me soon after my return from Europe, that an account of the Climate, modes of Living, and the Diseases of the lower parts of Vir∣ginia, after the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er of Cleghorne's Mi∣norca, might be of some service in investi∣gating the Causes and improving the treat∣ment of the Epidemics, and perhaps might induce the Medical Gentlemen dispersed over other parts of the State, to record and publish their observations, so as to form altogether, a book of useful practice. The interruption which would have been given to my business, however, and finding that more experience and time would be requisite than I could conveniently spare, prevented my pursuing the idea. From your advantageous situation, and your endeavours to collect information, there can be no doubt, but the performance will receive all the advantage which the as∣sistance of able and experienced Practition∣ers,
<PB N="280" REF="024239_0286_0FC56EF5CEEE4400"/>
united with your own observations, can afford; and I am sorry that professional engagements, mostly in the country, and the short notice, will not allow me to answer your queries to my satisfaction.</P>
<P>I AM at present residing in Hanover∣town, which is situated nearly at the head of navigation, on the South side of Pamunkey, the principal Branch of York River. It con∣tains about one hundred and seventy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The County of Hanover, by the late Census, contains 14,300 Inhabitants.</NOTE> inhabi∣tants, and is supported chiefly by Merchants, who have placed themselves here for the convenience of purchasing the best Tobacco in the State, which is supposed to be brought to the public warehouses at this place.</P>
<P>IT was thriving fast before the seat of government was removed to Richmond;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Richmond, the present Seat of Government in this State, is built upon a commanding eminence on the North side of James's River, a little way below the Falls, and ninety miles from its mouth, contains about 360 houses, and 2000 inhabi∣tants. This Town is about sixty miles Westward of Williams∣burgh, which contains about nine hundred inhabitants, and is about twenty-five miles Northward of Petersburgh. This last is built on the South side of Appomatox River, in a low situation.</NOTE>
<PB N="281" REF="024239_0287_0FC56EF6CF3E82F8"/>
but that city being only twenty miles distant, has considerably altered the channel of trade and retarded its increase. The town is built on an extensive plain, and the lands for many miles above and below it, are remarkably level and fertile, and the country in those di∣rections is generally thought the most beau∣tiful in Virginia;—but if its inhabitants pos∣sess superior advantages in the kindness of their soil, they suffer almost a proportional de∣duction from their profits and other enjoy∣ments, by being exposed to attacks from the Intermittent and Remittent Fevers, for two or three months in every year.</P>
<P>THE Country may be divided into low grounds, second low grounds or more ele∣vated, and the hills, which commence where the latter terminate. The former which
<PB N="282" REF="024239_0288_0FC56B795B977A00"/>
constitute the banks of the river, are subject to frequent inundations in the Spring and Fall; and many of them retain so much moisture throughout the year, as only to be fit for pastures, and are never cultivated. You will readily, therefore, conceive their situation towards the end of Summer, when the putrid exhalations go on rapidly, and you will also anticipate a description of those Intermittent and Remittent Fevers which Marsh Miasma so constantly produces. They are mostly Quotidians or Tertians; Quartans are seen but seldom, but if not speedily cured, are apt to continue twelve, eighteen months, or two years, especially with poor people; and I have seen fat and hearty Children have it for years, without any apparent injury to their health, excepting for a few hours on the fit-day. Our Winters are commonly mild, ex∣cepting a few weeks about Christmas, and though we may at other times have severe weather, it seldom continues long. The hard Frosts commence the last of December, and continue without much interruption all
<PB N="283" REF="024239_0289_0FC56B7A674EAEE0"/>
January and part of February, when there are frequent changes, and often much warm moist weather, from which time I date the beginning of the Spring Complaints. They are commonly Pneumonic or Pleuritic at∣tacks, accompanied with chills, nausea, and bilious vomiting. The pain begins in the side, breast, or shoulder blade, and not un∣frequently changes from one side to the other, or darts through from the breast to the shoul∣der. The chill is of short duration, and suc∣ceeded by the Fever, with a pain in the head, back, and large joints. A frequent dry Cough teazes the Patient, and renders the pain more acute, increases with the approach of night, and causes that to be very distres∣sing. The pulse varies from 90 to 120, and at first is generally hard and full. Towards morning the Fever suffers some remission, but by the middle of the day is higher than before. The first attack is attended with bilious vomitings, which exceedingly alarm the sick; but if properly encouraged, relieve
<PB N="284" REF="024239_0290_0FC56B7F205EF108"/>
the stomach, and are seldom dangerous unless when injudiciously treated.</P>
<P>OUR most successful Remedies in the Cure of this Compl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>int, are Bleeding, Blis∣ters, Laxatives, mild Diluents, and gentle Su∣dorifics. Early in the Disease we take away ten or twelve ounces of Blood, and if the pain is not removed, Cough continues dry, and pulse hard, the same quantity is drawn before the Blister is applied, which is probably the same night or the next morning.</P>
<P>THE violence of the Inflammation, age and vigour of the Patient, and the nature of the Epidemic, govern the Lancet, for we fre∣quently have a species of Synochus in the Spring especially after a warm Winter, which re∣quires great caution in Bleeding. I have seen many this year, with acute pains in the Head and short Ribs, when the Pulse was uncom∣monly low and soft at the commencement of the Disease. In such cases, Blisters to the part
<PB N="285" REF="024239_0291_0FC56B8039781CC8"/>
were the only Remedies to be relied on, with Wine and Water for constant drink, and the Bark in quantity, as soon as the pain was re∣moved. An Anodyne at night, after the In∣flammation is abated, quiets the Cough, oc∣casions the Patient to rest well, and with an Antimonial, disposes to a free perspiration. Since the Influenza prevailed here, I have learnt to use Opiates more freely in all Com∣plaints attended with a Cough, after the In∣flammation is removed, than I had before ventured to do. The contest, which has been so warmly supported by the partizans of Cul∣len and Brown, must be left to the decision of others; but I am fully persuaded, that the Doctrines of the latter have tended mate∣rially to remove prejudices, and to introduce more liberally into practice, one of the most valuable assistants to the healing Art, though I have more than once witnessed the impro∣per use of it by his pupils; such has been the case with many valuable Medicines, and it was from Goulard's extravagant recommen∣dations
<PB N="286" REF="024239_0292_0FC56B8817EB8900"/>
of the Solutions of Lead that we be∣came acquainted with their real virtues.</P>
<P>THE Blacks are remarkably subject to in∣flammatory Complaints from their exposure and deficiency of Cloathing; and I have ob∣served that they require the use of the Lan∣cet with considerably more freedom than the Whites. They are accustomed to bleed for the most trifling Diseases, and it is often dif∣ficult to persuade them of their recovery from any disorder without opening a vein. There are but few even of them, however, that would bear the loss of forty-eight, or fifty-seven ounces, as mentioned by Cleghorn, though our diseases correspond very much with those described by him; and I conceive, that half the quantity he took away during the first twenty-four hours, with the timely applica∣tion of Blisters, will conquer most Pneumo∣nic attacks with us, except in very particular constitutions.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="024239_0293_0FC56B893B405D90"/>
SOME Cases of Phthisis Pulmonalis oc∣cur generally in the Spring, for which I have endeavoured equally to avoid the weakening antiphlogistic, and the highly stimulating mode of treatment. It is unnecessary to give a detail of practice in this Disease; and I shall only observe, that in a few instances, considerable benefit is supposed to have been received from the use of a Swing, as recom∣mended by Dr. Smyth, where the Patients were weak and much reduced, it was suspended in the house, and convenient for use in all weather.</P>
<P>As the Spring advances, various erup∣tive complaints appear, and among the Blacks Scrophulous Swellings inflame and suppurate every year. To palliate the Disease from sea∣son to season, and let the Constitution acquire vigour enough to conquer it, and the danger∣ous period of life has past, which seldom ex∣tends beyond twenty-five, is all I ever could accomplish, and in some instances, I have been much perplexed to do that. Of late, the
<PB N="288" REF="024239_0294_0FC56B8AD1538C00"/>
internal use of Blue Vitriol has been strongly recommended by a famous empirick, and as I have at present some opportunities of trying it, I shall attend particularly to its admini∣stration and effects.</P>
<P>THE Cynanche Tonsilaris frequently oc∣curs; for which strong mercurial purges, assist∣ed by Blisters, have succeeded better with me than any other Remedies. The Cy∣nanche Maligna has also prevailed in some parts of the State, but I think it fortunate that it has not been my lot to engage it.</P>
<P>THE Measles, last year, added to the list of Epidemics, revived the old dispute respecting the propriety of Bleeding for it; some cases having terminated fatally after profuse Bleeding, it was considered by many as a fatal practice, though I do not recollect my having had cause to repent moderate Bleeding in any instance, while the advantage in many was very apparent; and in some, they left so
<PB N="289" REF="024239_0295_0FC56B92841E8508"/>
great inflammation on the Lungs, that re∣peated Venaesection was necessary.</P>
<P>THE Months of June and July are the most healthy in the year, though they are often as hot, and sometimes more so, than the succeeding. The Weather is then dry, and less liable to change than in August and Sep∣tember, when the rain commences, and sud∣den variations take place. Intermittents sel∣dom appear till after the tenth of August, and from that period to the same day in Oc∣tober, all Families on the Rivers and Creeks, have it constantly among them. The noc∣turnal Air at this time is to be cautiously avoided, and the slightest exposure or irregu∣larity, will endanger an attack by a Quoti∣dian or Tertian. We consider Madeira, Port Wine, and Porter, as the best preserva∣tives; and it is certain, that those who make daily use of them in moderation, are not so often sick, and with such assistance, recover soonest. The Fit, on the first evening of the
<PB N="290" REF="024239_0296_0FC56B93B27FE6F8"/>
attack, is commonly slight, and sometimes with a Chill and Fever hardly perceptible, and an aching of the Bones, which is taken for Rheumatic. The next Fit comes on earlier in the day with more violent pains in the Joints, succeeded by a Chilliness, as if streams of cold Water were running down the Back; nor can any Warmth be excited until the reaction of the System takes place. It is a general observation, that the Ague has changed within a few years from violent Shaking to a smart Chill, and though I can remember to have seen the Teeth chatter, it is seldom thecase now. As the Fever rises a Glow on the Surface is visible, the Face be∣gins to flush, and with that a Head-ach com∣mences, which increases with the Fever, and continues as long as that lasts. The Pulse, which during the cold Fit is weak and small, rises gradually to fulness and quick∣ness; the Drought is considerable, and the Tongue and Mouth dry and parched. After a few hours a Sweat begins to break out, which gives much relief, and by the Morn∣ing
<PB N="291" REF="024239_0297_0FC56B958856FAB0"/>
carries off the Fever, leaving the Body weak and feeble, the Tongue furred, with loss of Appetite, and a bitter Taste in the Mouth. As the cold Fit goes off, a Vomit∣ing of Bile often takes place, and if properly encouraged, discharges the Morbid Contents of the Stomach, and removes the Sickness; for Dr. Moore<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Medical Sketches</NOTE> has well observed, that Vomit∣ing is most effectually cured by Vomiting.</P>
<P>THE Paroxysms are nearly the same, whether they are Tertians, Quartans, or Quo∣tidians, and the same treatment will generally effect the Cure of each.</P>
<P>IF the Head-ach is violent, with a full and strong Pulse, eight or ten ounces of Blood are taken away at the Height of the Fever, and an Emetic, composed of Ipecacuanha and Tartar, is directed to be taken early in the Morning succeeding the Fit, and if it both vomits and purges well, the Bark is admini∣stered without delay, so as to get six or eight
<PB N="292" REF="024239_0298_0FC56B9DAA228F60"/>
drams down before the next period of acces∣sion. If it does not stop the next Fit, it so weakens it, that another ounce answers the purpose, and the use of it in smaller quantity for a few days restores health. If the Bark does not prove laxative, a purge should be interposed, to prevent the accumulation of Bile in the Primae Viae, which will either occasion the Bark to be rejected, or occasion violent pain in the Stomach. In the Cure of Remittents, which are at present more com∣mon than formerly, we seldom wait for the Fever to go entirely off; but if the Bowels have been properly evacuated, and a general moisture can be accomplished, I have given the Bark when the Pulse was at 90° or 100°, and have found it to increase the Sweating, and thus have prevented the return of the Fever, which could not so easily have been done, if that Medicine had been delayed: I am, however, fully sensible that there are errors committed, in giving it hastily before the Primae Viae have been sufficiently cleansed; and I have often seen this done effectually by
<PB N="293" REF="024239_0299_0FC56B9F052F3D70"/>
an Emetic, when repeated Purgatives have failed. I have known Vomiting objected to by Physicians of reputation, as being an un∣natural operation; but this only applies to Health, for a sick Stomach voluntarily re∣lieves itself. Among the lower class of people, with whom the Intermittent often continues twelve or eighteen months, and sometimes for years, Abdominal Congestions, Ulcerated Legs, and Dropsical Swellings, are not unfrequently the consequence. As the following case, which I attended last year, was from this cause, I shall take the liberty of concluding this letter with it, though it may be thought already too long. Having been often disappointed in my expectations from Diuretics, the success which attended the administration of Squills in this instance induced me to recored it.</P>
<P>On the 6th of August, I was desired to visit two Girls, about three miles from town, whose Parents lived within half a mile of two
<PB N="294" REF="024239_0300_0FC56BA296309678"/>
Mill Ponds. They both appeared to be in the last stage of the Dropsy, and one of them died a few days afterwards. The death of the oldest, (perhaps she might be about twelve or thirteen years of age), appeared to be al∣most as certain, though it might not be so soon: She had been troubled with an Inter∣mittent for nearly two years, which had left her about a month before in a state of great debility. A short time after the Fever ceased, the Swelling of her Abdomen was discovered, and was soon followed by an Anasarca of all the lower parts of her Body, even as high as her Breasts. When I was called in, her Legs were hard, tense, and cracked and ulcerated in several places, so as to make painful sores. Her Breathing was laborious and difficult, and her Coughing almost constant. Her Face was also considerably swelled, and for several nights she had been obliged to sleep in an erect posture. Her Abdomen was greatly disten∣ded, and an evident fluctuation of the water within, was to be felt. If she laid down on her side for any time, it left the superior
<PB N="295" REF="024239_0301_0FC56BA38573C850"/>
parts, and all settled in those that were lowest.</P>
<P>HER appearance altogether was so un∣favourable, that nothing but her youth af∣forded any prospect of success; and I under∣took to administer Medicines more for the satisfaction of the Patient, than from any hopes of my own.</P>
<P>AFTER trying several Remedies with little benefit, I was almost persuaded it would be necessary to evacuate the water from her Abdomen by the Trocar; but was afraid, that at such an advanced stage of the Disease, the operation might hasten her exit, instead of preventing it. In this situation I determined make the last effort, with Squills combined with Nitre, and gave it in the following manner:
<LIST>

<P><PB N="296" REF="024239_0302_0FC56BA51BCD8DC0"/>
SHE began the use of them on Friday morning, and I did not see her again until Monday, when the good effect from them was surprisingly great. She informed me that she felt herself much better on Saturday, and rested more comfortably that night than she had for many nights before. On Sun∣day a considerable increase of urine was evi∣dent, and the Swelling of her Belly began to subside. On Monday, I found the water almost entirely removed, and her Legs and Thighs so reduced, that she could walk with ease, which before had been very painful. Her appetite was much increased, and she expressed by the joy in her countenance, the relief she had obtained, and the change from misery and despair to ease, and the pleasing, though unexpected prospect of a speedy re∣covery of Health. The Squill Pills were continued for a few days, which entirely carried off the water, and by the assistance of the Bark, and daily exercise, it was prevented from collecting again, and I heard no more of her complaint.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="024239_0303_0FC56BAB14C6FC28"/>
I HAD forgot to mention, that her Pa∣rents were very poor, and in addition to the poverty of her Diet, she had been much ex∣posed in all Weather, during the time of her having the Intermittent. It has been ob∣served by some eminent Physicians, that the Diuretic effects of Squills are not sensible, unless there is some operation in the Stomach from them. Dr. Cullen in his last Edition of his Materia Medica, gives his opinion on the subject in the following words:</P>
<P>THIS perhaps may be founded; but I understand it no otherwise than that some operation on the Stomach is a test, and a ne∣cessary test, of the Squills being in an active state, in the same manner, as we are only certain of the activity of Mercurial Pre∣parations when they have shewn some effect on the Mouth. In the present instance I at∣tended particularly to their operation on the Stomach, but it was so slight, as not to give any uneasiness. There was a little Nausea
<PB N="298" REF="024239_0304_0FC56BAEB83CD1F0"/>
for a short time after taking the morning dose, but so inconsiderable as not to be no∣ticed, until particular enquiries were made on the subject. If their Diuretic effects had not been so sudden, I should have increased the Dose as far as the Stomach would have permitted, but from their neither Vomiting or Purging, they were more powerful Diu∣retics without weakening the Patient.</P>
<P>IN offering this imperfect answer to your Letter, my being unprepared at the time, and unable to pay that attention I could wish, must excuse errors and defects, in which persuasion I have ventured to send it forward.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS on the Diseases of the Eastern Parts of Virginia, particularly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Norfolk, the most populous Town in Virginia, contains only about 6000 inhabitants.</NOTE> Norfolk and the neighbouring Counties. Communicated by Dr. TAYLOR, and Dr. HANSFORD, of Norfolk, August 10, 1791.</HEAD>
<P>IN the investigation of Endemic Diseases, of their Cause, Progress, and Termination, it would appear, that an enquiry into the state of the Atmosphere at various Periods; the Situation of Places; the surrounding Produc∣tions of the Earth; the Rivers, Marshes, Lakes, and even Infects, ought to be added to the account. If the Limits of the Publication, for which these Pages are intended, would permit such an Enquiry, we might easily de∣scribe every thing but the Climate, which has been always so irregular, both with respect to Hot and Cold, Wet and Dry Seasons, that were we to recount the Changes which have come immediately under our Observation,
<PB N="301" REF="024239_0307_0FC56BB9F6DA9E28"/>
the Reader would suppose we were speaking of several Countries situated under different parallels of Latitude. As we cannot enter fully into the subject, we shall only occa∣sionally mention the Seasons and Changes of Weather, when they seem to relate to the subject we are treating of. If we were to attempt to account for the Diseases, and their Varieties, from the Weather we might per∣haps mislead the Reader, as well as deceive ourselves;—for the Science of Medicine is so young in this Country, that we have not the light of former Practitioners to guide us through the dark Labyrinth; too dark indeed, even where the strongest rays of Human Wisdom are thrown upon it. The Country we speak of is low Land, mostly within twelve feet of the level of the Sea, intersected in all directions with Salt-Creeks and Rivers, the Heads of which form Swamps and Marshes, and Fenny Grounds covered with Water in wet Seasons. Wherever it is not cultivated, the Land is covered with large
<PB N="302" REF="024239_0308_0FC56BC039553348"/>
Timber and thick Underwood. The vici∣nity of the Sea, and the Salt-Creeks and Ri∣vers, occasion a constant moisture and warmth of the Atmosphere, insomuch, that although under the same Latitude a hundred miles up the Country, deep Snows and frozen Rivers are very common during the Winter, yet here we consider such occurrences as Pheno∣mena; for these Reasons, the Spring is very early ushered in, sometimes so early, that many Trees are in Bloom about the latter end of February; from this time, however, till the end of April we are subject to cold Rains, piercing Winds, and sharp Frosts; it is at this Period only (if we except the Influenza) that any Inflammatory Diseases ever appear among us; and these are confined to People who live exposed to bleak Winds on the Banks of large Rivers, on the Chesapeake, or on the Sea, or whose Occupations expose them to similar Inconveniences of Situation. We may comprise the whole of the Inflam∣matory Diseases known here under the Terms Pleurisy and Peripneumony;—when these
<PB N="303" REF="024239_0309_0FC56BC1759D5780"/>
attack strong Plethoric habits, or healthy stran∣gers from the North, or from the Uplands, we observe nothing uncommon in the appear∣ances of the Disease, neither does the mode of treatment require to be altered from the general Antiphlogistic Plan commonly laid down for the Cure. But when Persons who have long been Residents in this part of the Country are the subjects of Pleurisy or Pe∣ripneumony, we have always found the Lancet a very dangerous Remedy, and never use it but with extreme caution;—after the Emetics or Cathartics, we find it much safer to alleviate the painful Symptoms by the use of Opium, joined to powerful Diaphoretics, such as Vin. Antimon. Tart. Emetic, Spt. Minder. Camphor, &amp;c. with Expectorants, occasionally Blisters, partial application of Warm-baths, and if an irritated Stomach (a circumstance we have frequently to contend with in many Diseases) refuses the Opium with Antimonial Preparations or Camphor, we never scruple to use it alone; and however
<PB N="304" REF="024239_0310_0FC56BC5ABDE31B0"/>
extraordinary it may appear to some Practi∣tioners, we never had any cause to suspect it of doing an injury to full and strong habits; though we confess, with those of the latter description, it does not seem to produce the desired effect so uniformly as we could wish. These Fevers, like almost all others in this Climate, uniformly put on the appearance of an Intermittent after the fifth day, or as soon as the Expectoration is complete; in many therefore the Bark becomes necessary at the close of the Disease. Inflammatory Diseases are seldom fatal if thus managed, and scarce ever terminate in Phthisis Pulmonalis; this latter indeed seldom originates here.</P>
<Q><P>WE have a Root for which we do not remember any Botanical name, distinguished under the title of Pleurisy Root; this many of our Country Practitioners assert—to be of great efficacy in Inflammatory Diseases; and we think it deserves some attention, and frequently use it joined to Seneka in decoction.
<PB N="305" REF="024239_0311_0FC56BC77945CDE0"/>
Seneka, either with or without the other, produces a gentle Diarrhoea, which manifest∣ly relieves the Patient without checking the Expectoration.</P>
<P>ABOUT the middle of May, the Wea∣ther becomes sultry, with some cool days, occasioned by the change of Winds to the North and North-East: At this period all the Diseases of the Winter begin to decline, and the whole Country is universally healthy (except here and there a trifling Vernal In∣termittent which scarce requires the appli∣cation of Medicine) till the middle or latter end of June, when Diarrhoeas and Dysente∣ries appear among the Children, mostly with those under two years old, though not absolutely confined to such.</P>
<P>IN some years the Diarrhoea is almost universal, attended for the most part with an irritation of the Stomach, and an irregular Fever of the Intermittent kind: After the proper Evacuations, we apply Bark in large
<PB N="306" REF="024239_0312_0FC56BC8F2FB73E0"/>
quantities, joined to the most approved a∣stringents and Anodynes; Gum Kino, Opi∣um, Spec. e Scord. &amp;c. and when the Sto∣mach will not bear a sufficient quantity of Bark, we throw it up in Glysters repeatedly, for many days together, and this we have learnt, by experience, to be the only mode which can be depended on.</P>
<P>THE Diarrhoea of many of these Chil∣dren resist every medical effort to cure them; and these Children gradually decline in Flesh, and contract a Chronic Apthae, which visibly extends throughout the whole Alimentary Canal.</P>
<P>WE have seen the Disease in this State in almost every large town we are acquainted with;—nor do we know of any certain Cure; many have recom∣mended the use of Alum, Spec. e. Scord. with the Gum Kino, and have asserted, that great relief has been found therefrom: Others have ventured the use of a Solution of Vitriol.
<PB N="307" REF="024239_0313_0FC56BD295E813F8"/>
Caerul. but we have never attempted this. It would appear that a Change of Air to a more Northern and cold Climate, or to Places where the use of Chalybeate Waters can be had, would be adviseable; many have reco∣vered by such means, but we have also seen many recover, who were reduced perfectly to Skeletons, without removing at all, or mak∣ing use of Medicines of any kind.</P>
<P>DYSENTERIES in Children are not so difficult to cure; the common means, such as lpecacuan. Vitr. Cerat. Antimon. Ol. Ricin. Rhubarb. Simaroub. &amp;c. seldom fail to re∣move the Disease if judiciously administered.</P>
<P>AT some Periods we have a Dysentery among the Adults, which may be called Epidemic; but as this differs in no degree from those which are common to warm Cli∣mates, it is entirely unnecessary to say more about it, except that in the cure it does not require those large Evacuations previous
<PB N="308" REF="024239_0314_0FC56BD437013510"/>
to administering Astringents and Anodynes, which we have seen used by some Practi∣tioners in other Countries, and it will never admit of the Lancet.</P>
<P>IN July, the Heat of the Weather in∣creases; but during the whole of this Month and the greatest part of August, there are no Diseases at all, at least none which can be called Epidemic. On the approach of the Autumnal Months, Intermittents begin to appear throughout the Country.</P>
<P>IT is not our Province here to recapitulate the several Opinions concerning the Cause and Nature of those Fevers, nor yet to divide them into numberless Species and Genera. We have never been able to distinguish any other difference in the Nature of Intermit∣tents, than that which Constitution, Cli∣mate, and Manner of Living give rise to; those Causes will divide them into Perfect, Imperfect, or Remittent: The several Ter∣minations
<PB N="309" REF="024239_0315_0FC56BD60404D6D0"/>
of them which we frequently ob∣serve into Continued, Putrid, or Nervous Fevers, will be found to arise from the same Causes, and under those simple terms we shall proceed to treat of Intermittents in all their Stages.</P>
<P>THOSE which occur earliest in the Sea∣son are uniformly of the mildest kind, and yield soonest to the proper Medicines. A∣mong the Labouring and Temperate Class of our Citizens, whose Diet is simple, whose Hours are regular, and whose use of Spiritu∣ous Liquors is sparing, those Fevers are per∣fect Intermittents, generally of the Tertian kind, and though not confined particularly to any age or sex, yet are most frequent among the younger class, the Females and the Chil∣dren; they are in wet Seasons almost general among those of the latter description in coun∣try places, and in low fenny ground. They yield immediately to proper Evacuations, and the use of the Peruvian Bark, and seldom
<PB N="310" REF="024239_0316_0FC56BDB963C90E0"/>
outlast the Autumnal Months, even without the assistance of any Art: Sometimes, how∣ever, in relaxed Habits, they terminate in Jaundice, enlarged Spleen, Anasarca, and Death. We shall not be particular upon this sort of Intermittents, because they are in no∣thing different from those which prevail in all countries similarly situated.</P>
<P>AMONG that Class of Citizens, whose hours are more irregular, and whose use of Wine and luxurious Food is more frequent, those Fevers, though still retaining the Inter∣mittent, Quotidian, and Tertian Form, are nevertheless imperfectly so; a great degree of Heat, quickness of Pulse, and Debility remain during the whole time, which may be called Intermission, with partial or total Loss of Appetite. Here Intermittents begin to put on an appearance, which we think very dif∣ferent from those of any other Country; they are preceded by a Chilliness, which com∣monly seizes the Patient when he thinks
<PB N="311" REF="024239_0317_0FC56BDF9326E888"/>
himself in perfect Health. Head-ach, great Thirst and Heat soon follow, in many in∣stances Delirium, Vomiting, Diarrhoea, and large Discharges of Bile;—about the fifth, seventh, or twelfth hour the Patient is reliev∣ed by prosuse Sweat, which continues with the aforementioned Heat, Quickness of Pulse, and Debility, till the next Paroxysm. These are generally of the T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tian kind, and return regularly if no Medicine is used, from nine to fourteen days, when they will commonly terminate altogether, or degenerate into a slight Quotidian, which allows the Patient to walk about, and when the cold Weather ap∣proaches for the most part leave him alto∣gether.</P>
<P>PEOPLE of the latter description are more rarely the subjects of Intermittent Fe∣vers than those who live in a plain manner; and if proper Evacuations are made, and the Bark administered with perseverance, and at∣tention to the Stomach and first Passages, the
<PB N="312" REF="024239_0318_0FC56BE3652B2AD0"/>
Disease may almost certainly be cured after the third Paroxism, and very often even a se∣cond is prevented.</P>
<P>WE have always experienced Cathartics to be the safest and most effectual Evacuations in those kinds of Fevers; and if the Patient has an irritated Stomach with Costiveness, Emetics are not only inadequate and unne∣cessary but dangerous. We frequently find great difficulty in making the Stomach bear a sufficient quantity of Cathartic Medicines to procure the desired Evacuations: when this is the case, Laudanum and Aqua Menthae, or Extract. Thebaic, are administered an hour or two before the Purge, which generally causes the latter to remain, and though the Opiate retards the operation, it does not ulti∣mately prevent it, or render it less powerful. After this we proceed to the use of the Bark during the Intermissions, and without regard to measure, give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t as profusely as the Sto∣mach will permit, and in the most powerful
<PB N="313" REF="024239_0319_0FC56BE4CD74E2A0"/>
form, beginning with the Powder, and oc∣casionally using the Decoction, the Extract, and cold Infusion. It too often happens, that the Stomach will not bear the Medicine at all, in which case we give large quantities of the Decoction or Infusion by Clysters; and we can venture to assert, when those Clysters are retained in sufficient Quantity, the effect is equal to that produced by any other mode of administering it. During the Paroxysm, we find great Relief procured, by making the Patient drink plentifully of a strong Infu∣sion of Serpent. Virgin, to which, when the Symptoms are very painful, we add Lauda∣num in sufficient quantity to procure the Pa∣tient perfect ease. These last Medicines, particularly the Serpent, have a visible power of shortening the Paroxysm, and will rarely disagree with the Stomach. The use of Opium, its safety and advantage in those cases, we presume to be well known; there∣fore we shall decline making any Observations upon it, except that we have not found it (as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s been asserted) capable <HI>per se,</HI> of curing
<PB N="314" REF="024239_0320_0FC56BE87923FDA0"/>
Intermittents. It has been advised to give it in conjunction with the several Preparations of Bark, where the irritable state of the Sto∣mach will not bear the Cort. alone. This ex∣pedient will succeed, if the quantity from time to time be increased, and is often used with success, though it invariably occasions great distress to the Patient when the Fever leaves him, by inducing an Hysterical or Hy∣pochondriacal sensation, which if it does not amount to pain, the Patient will tell you his feelings are far worse than if it did.</P>
<P>THE use of this Medicine to prevent the passage of the Bark by stool is known to every one; but we think the Gum. Kino for ge∣neral use much better, and more permanent in its effects.</P>
<P>AT the accession of those Fevers there is frequently a full hard Pulse, inflamed Eyes, a sense of fullness in the Breast, and some∣times a sharp Pain in the Side, resembling
<PB N="315" REF="024239_0321_0FC56BF09986A330"/>
that which attends inflammatory Fevers. These circumstances have often led Practition∣ers, and others who are unacquainted with the Climate, to bleed the Patient; an ex∣pedient, which if it does not produce a ten∣dency to Putrefaction, invariably fixes the Fever so firmly, that the Cure becomes after∣wards exceedingly difficult.</P>
<P>WHEN no Medicines are given at all, we have observed before, that the Fever for the most part will decline of itself on the ninth or fourteenth day, or degenerate into a slight Quotidian, and sometimes a Quartan; this is, however, not always the case.</P>
<P>IF no Medicine has been given, or if the Disease has been improperly treated by Bleeding, or by too great Evacuations, other∣wise by forbidding the use of Wine, &amp;c. the Fever sometimes becomes Remittent.</P>
<P>IN the town we have also many of these
<PB N="316" REF="024239_0322_0FC56BF238FB3820"/>
Fevers, which though clearly belonging to the Class of Intermittents, are Aborigine Remittents; because, there is an evident ten∣dency to decline of the Fever at a particular time, once in twenty-four hours, every other day, or every fourth day, and all the Diagno∣stic Symptoms are precisely the same as they are in a distinct Intermittent, making allow∣ance for Age, Sex, and Constitution; nor do the means of Cure differ, though variously ap∣plied.</P>
<P>THAT Species of Remittent which arises from neglect, or improper treatment of Intermittents (except that Evacuations should be cautiously repeated) may be treated in the same manner with those we are about to de∣scribe.</P>
<P>IN the Town, throughout the Months of September and October, many of the In∣habitants are seized with Fevers, which be∣gin by Chilliness, a sense of fulness in the
<PB N="317" REF="024239_0323_0FC56BF3D34C2F80"/>
Stomach, followed by Pains throughout the Limbs, Neck, Back, and Hips, great Heat and prostration of Strength, which proceed and terminate as before described, under the Term of imperfect Intermittents. But others who are attacked in the same manner, par∣ticularly Robust and Plethoric Habits, or those who are accustomed to drink a great deal of Wine, Porter, &amp;c. and take plenti∣fully of luxurious Food, have a greater sense of Heat, more Pain in the Limbs, and much more Oppression and Debility—are extremely restless, sometimes with Delirium, and great Thirst; and when the Period of Intermission of the Fever should arrive, viz. the ninth or twelfth hour, are but partially relieved, that is, the sense of Heat is not so great, the De∣lirium and Restlessness are somewhat abated, and there are some few strokes difference in the Pulse; and when there is Nausea and Vomiting, those likewise partly cease to tor∣ment the Patient, but the prostration of Strength, Pain in the Limbs, &amp;c. with the
<PB N="318" REF="024239_0324_0FC56BF54CDCB1B0"/>
dry Skin, still remain: Here the Evacuation by Cathartics should be attempted without delay, and the Period of the Remission (which though obscure, lasts several hours) employed in administering Bark in every possible form, without regard to the Quick∣ness of Pulse and dry Skin; Wine should be given in large quantities, and on the return of of the Paroxysm, the Patient should drink profusely of an Infusion of Serpentar. with Wine.</P>
<P>WHEN this Plan is followed with per∣severance, the Patient almost always recovers, though the Paroxysm, or properly speaking, the violent hours of the Fever, may return once or twice; but if this is neglected, after the second return, the Fever puts on a malig∣nant and putrid Type, and often ends in Death.</P>
<P>WE have sometimes found it imprac∣ticable to make the Patient keep the Bark
<PB N="319" REF="024239_0325_0FC56BFED6AAB818"/>
in any form, or by any mode of giving it; when this is the case, the Disease is always dangerous, and the only Expedient we have left is the use of Wine and Serpentar, and we have so many times experienced the ad∣vantage of this last Medicine, by giving it in large quantity, that we cannot help earnestly recommending it to the notice of every Prac∣titioner.</P>
<P>IT is a Medicine, though of known effi∣cacy, very much neglected, at least the pro∣per administration of it; like the Bark, it can∣not be given in too large a quantity, when the Stomach will bear it. The Fevers of the latter description are less common than the others.</P>
<P>WHEN the Disease begins to yield to the Medicine, a profuse Sweat comes on; the Pulse grows full, slow, and soft; the sense of Heat and Pain in the Limbs, Back, Hips, and Neck abate and gradually subside; the Pa∣tient
<PB N="320" REF="024239_0326_0FC56BFFCC441360"/>
has a desire to eat, and in a few day he feels nothing but a Debility, which is far from being so great as the violence of the Disease would give cause to suspect, and a very little time restores him to perfect health and vigour.</P>
<P>WHEN it is about to terminate unfavour∣ably, there is an increased irritation of the Stomach, with vomiting of Cystic Bile, mix∣ed with tough Mucus, attended in some cases with Diarrhoea; the Pulse grows smal∣ler, quicker, and intermits, or rather seems at times to retreat from the Finger while feel∣ing it; the Countenance falls, the Eyes become glossy, the Tongue black and dry, the Teeth cemented over with a black mucilaginous substance, cold Extremities, and Death; the Pulse, however, is never to be depended upon in the termination of those Fevers; it is some∣times so hard, full, and regular, even at the moment that every other Symptom evinces the approach of Death, that inexperienced
<PB N="321" REF="024239_0327_0FC56C04309758A8"/>
Practitioners would be often induced to bleed or evacuate when the Patient is expiring.</P>
<P>WHEN continued Fevers from Intermit∣tents take place, they are generally confined to relaxed, debilitated, or young habits; they are far from being common with us, and as in every other Country, they either terminate on the twenty-first and thirty-first day, or lengthen out into what are called Nervous Fevers, we shall neither treat of this stage of the Disorder, or pretend to point out a mode of cure, for what ever may be the predispo∣sing Cause, the Disease is invariably the same, and requires the same mode of treatment in every country. We must, however, take notice of one effect which some Intermit∣tents produce, viz. A Debility or Affection of the Optic Nerve, so as to render the Patient perfectly blind, till the Bark and other Tonics, have removed the Fever, when those Patients recover their Sight with Health.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="024239_0328_0FC56C04F656F320"/>
IN the Autumn of Eighty-nine, the Influenza made its appearance here, as it did throughout the Continent a little before and after that time, We should not have taken notice of this Disease, which has been at times common to various parts of the World, if we had not observed something singular in its progress through this Part of the Country.</P>
<P>DURING the whole month of August in that year, the Weather was remarkably cool and pleasant, with the Wind from the North-West to the North-East, and continued so with some little intervals of South Winds and moderate Heat till the last of September, when the Influenza began to appear, and from the time these Winds sprung up we had no Intermittents as in former and succeeding years.</P>
<P>THE Influenza though universal, scarce one in a thousand escaping it, was mild, and attended with a slight Fever, only some few instances excepted where Pleurisy and Perip∣neumony
<PB N="323" REF="024239_0329_0FC56C0CAE353940"/>
took place: two or three only of those Died, more, we believe, from improper management than from the Malignity of the Disease itself, most of those to whom it had proved fatal being profusely bled and evacu∣ated. We only recollect one instance of any person, who, in consequence of this Disease, afterwards died with Phthisis Pulmonalis▪ a circumstance which has frequently happened in other parts of Virginia and to the North. Notwithstanding this Epidemic was visibly of an inflammatory kind, it would not, with us, admit of what is called the antiphlogistic plan; and we are authorized to say this, be∣cause in pursuing a middle way, that is, by moderate evacuations and Diaphoretics with∣out bleeding, and afterwards a free use of the Bark, we have lost none of those Patients whom we had the management of from the beginning. An inflammatory Disorder simi∣lar to this, and by some called by the same name, again appeared, beginning in the Win∣ter 1790. This was generally attended with Symptoms of Inflammation considerably worse than what we have been accustomed
<PB N="324" REF="024239_0330_0FC56C0EB45BEA58"/>
to call the original Influenza, nevertheless, we could not find upon trial that any ad∣vantage was derived from the Lancet. This complaint was much more fatal than the for∣mer, and often resisted every application for relief. In the latter end of the Winter 1784, we had a species of Malignant Angina which was Epidemic and contagious; and although we have never experienced any thing similar to it since, or any tradition of its having hap∣pened in this Country, yet we think we have both seen and read of the same Disease else∣where. If the manner in which we have in several places recommended the use of the Bark should appear extraordinary, we have only to beg the Reader to rely upon our words for the success of such Practice, which we assure him a very long course of Experi∣ence taught us not only to be beneficial, but absolutely free from danger in our Climate at least. We have had reason to think (tho' we will not venture to give it as a positive fact), that the Peruvian Bark is considerably lost active in the Cure of Intermittents, in Constitutions which have been long accus∣tomed
<PB N="325" REF="024239_0331_0FC56C107229D7B8"/>
to the free use of Wine, ardent Spi∣rits, and luxurious food; even where such Constitutions have not been visibly Impaired, or Debilitated by such habits. If this be true, Wine and ardent Spirits, as has been observed by many Practitioners, possess a considerable share of the Specific virtues of Bark. This last, we have pretty well ascertained, will not prevent what it will Cure; that is, the con∣stant use of it will not preserve a Person from the attack of an Intermittent, though it will afterwards remove it, but must be taken in much larger Quantities than would have been necessary if the Habit had not been before accustomed to it; and if Wine and ardent Spirits possess any of its Specific Virtues, the habitual application of those to the Constitu∣tion may lessen the power of the Bark, in the same manner as if itself had been constantly taken. We offer this as a mere matter of opi∣nion, which cannot be thought extraordina∣ry, if we may reason from Analogy and com∣pare the action of Opium, and many other Medicines, which gradually lose their pow∣er by repeated application.</P></Q>

<HEAD>A SKETCH of the SITUATION, CLIMATE, and DISEASES of NORTH-CAROLINA.</HEAD>
<Q><P>THIS State, (bounded North by Vir∣ginia, East by the Atlantic Ocean; South by South-Carolina and Georgia; and West by the Missisipi,) is situated between the 34° and 36° 30′ North Latitude. It is 758 Miles in length, and about 110 in breadth</P>
<P>IT is plentifully supplied with Rivers, Bays, Inlets, Morasses and Swamps; it is but thinly settled, and indifferently cultivated in proportion to its extent. There is one Swamp in this State, called the Dismal Swamp, which extends over a large tract of Country, between Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds; and another North of Edentown,
<PB N="327" REF="024239_0333_0FC56C1639FF36B8"/>
which lies partly in this State and partly in Virginia. This last tract of Swamp or Marsh Ground contains upwards of 140,000 Acres.</P>
<P>NEWBERN, the largest Town in this State, contains only about 400 houses, all built of Wood; and stands on a flat Sandy point of Land formed by the Confluence of the Rivers Neus and Trent.</P>
<P>NORTH-CAROLINA, in its whole breadth for the extent of 60 Miles from the Sea, is a dead level. A great proportion of this tract is a barren Forest. On the Banks of some of the Rivers, the land is fertile and good. In∣terspersed through the other parts, are glades of rich Swamp, and ridges of Oakland of a black fertile Soil. The Sea Coast, the Sounds, Inlets, and lower parts of the Rivers, have uniformly a muddy soft bottom.</P>
<P>About 80 or 90 Miles to the Westward of the Atlantic, this State begins to swell in∣to
<PB N="328" REF="024239_0334_0FC56C18A980B9B0"/>
Hills which increase in size, and are more mixed with stones, also of increased magni∣tude the farther we proceed in that direction. The Soil in these parts is of reddish Clay and Loam, strong and fertile; the Woods less in∣termingled with Pines and more with Oak and Hickory; and the Water is every where excellent, running in a profusion of clear and refreshing streams.</P>
<P>THE Country and Climate to the West∣ward is in general healthy, the low Grounds along the Rivers alone being otherwise, par∣ticularly those of the Roanoak, occasioned by exhalations arising from the damp Soil, stag∣nated Waters, and by the putrescent particles with which the Atmosphere is replete, whose free circulation and purification is prevented in such situations, by lofty thick Woods, impervious to the Suns rays, under which a dismal Gloom for ever dwells.</P>
<P>IN such situations we find Intermittents and Remittents, the principal Endemial Dis∣eases
<PB N="329" REF="024239_0335_0FC56C19FB6093A8"/>
of this State, insomuch that even in the Winter Season we find that most of the Com∣plaints which begin with Inflammatory Symptoms, are changed in the course of a few days into one or other of these.</P>
<P>THE Winters of this State, are more pleasant and agreeable than can well be con∣ceived; they are neither so Hot as to incom∣mode, nor so Cold as to be disagreeable. And for the most part, the Weather is Clear, Bright, and Serene; and the Ground (where fertile) is covered with delightful verdure. For here all the Inclemency of the Weather is in the Summer. At this Season, the in∣tense Heat and the scorching rays of the Sun are almost intolerable; and multitudes of troublesome Flies, Muskittoes, and other In∣sects and Reptiles, continually infest and prey upon every Living Creature in the Fields and Woods, sucking their Blood, and giving con∣tinual torment both Day and Night; so that every kind of Beast becomes miserably Lean and Weak, while this Season lasts. Even to
<PB N="330" REF="024239_0336_0FC56C1B709C0BC8"/>
Man, with all his resources and advantages, the Heat then becomes intolerable, nor can he find any shelter or defence against the as∣saults of these tormenting Insects, and vene∣mous Reptiles, which infest the Air and Earth.</P>
<P>BOTH Rice and Indigo are cultivated on the low wet Grounds; these increase the unwholesomeness of the Air, because the Quantity of Water which they require for their support becomes stagnant in many pla∣ces. The Indigo requires a great deal of Water in its Manufacture, and soon becomes putrid in this sultry Climate; in this condi∣tion it becomes extremely offensive and in∣salubrious; the rotten Indigo plant is often hawled out, and spread over the Fields to manure the Grounds, and becomes abomi∣nably noisome, rendering the Atmosphere for some distance absolutely deleterious, and frequently almost pestilential.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="024239_0337_0FC56C2187435060"/>
DURING the latter part of Summer and the beginning of Autumn, putrid and noxious effluvia rise in very gross and thick vapours from the valleys, from stagnant and shallow pools, or fens, especially after heavy showers, and the lasting and excessive heats which succeeds such rains.</P>
<P>THE dews are likewise near the sea-coast very copious in the beginning of Autumn, in a still evening and in the night, and the whole country is covered with a thick fog till after seven o'clock in the morning.</P>
<P>ALONG the Sea coast, the East Winds are the coolest in Summer, and the warmest in Winter." (Winds have a demonstrable influence on the temperature of the Atmos∣phere; and since these must, like all the other phenomena of nature, be governed by fixed and determinate laws, they deserve investi∣gation.) Unusual cold happens either in the Summer or in the Winter season; the cir∣cumstances
<PB N="332" REF="024239_0338_0FC56C24C4332A30"/>
which render Summers less warm than usual are pretty obvious; for the diminution of heat may arise either from a long continuance of Easterly or Northerly Winds, or from frequent and heavy Rains, which are followed by great evaporation; or from a long continuance of cloudy weather which intercepts the Sun's rays, and prevents the Earth from absorbing them.</P>
<P>THE causes of unusual cold in Winter, in this Climate, are of more difficult investiga∣tion. Those best ascertained, are, 1st. Un∣usual cold in the preceding Summer: For, as the Winter's heat is in a great measure de∣rived from the Earth, if this be deprived of its usual store of heat, the want of it must be perceived the ensuing Winter. 2d. Hea∣vy Rains, followed by Westerly or Northerly winds; this is owing to the powerful evapo∣ration promoted by these dry Winds.</P></Q>

<HEAD>DISEASES.</HEAD>
<P>THE Climate of this State so nearly re∣sembles that of South-Carolina, that I shall omit giving any farther description of it here, and shall only enumerate such Diseases as are most prevalent. Dr. Smith informs me, that, <Q>East of the Mountains, a spurious kind of Pleurisy, accompanied with profuse expectoration of a thin gleety Mucus, is the most prevalent complaint in the Winter and Spring seasons; the Pulse, in this Disease, is more frequent, but never so hard, full, or strong as in the true Pleurisy; the inflamma∣tory symptoms are observed to subside much earlier, and are very apt to be succeeded by symptoms resembling those of the Typhus, or rather of the Remitting Fever.</Q></P>
<P>"MODERATE bleeding, at the commence∣ment of the Fever, is generally of service, but a repetition is seldom found salutary;
<PB N="334" REF="024239_0340_0FC56C2843E79A70"/>
and copious bleeding has invariably occasi∣oned such a state of debility in a number of cases in which I have employed it, misled by servilely copying the practice of Syden∣ham, and the Lectures of a celebrated fo∣reign Professor, that I am now always mo∣derate in the quantity I direct to be taken away." But mild Emetics, and especially nauseating doses of Antimonials with mode∣rate purging, and the early application of Blisters to the Thorax, or back, are the re∣medies which I have found most generally beneficial.</P>
<Q><P>I HAVE also given Opium, combined with a little Tartar Emetic, or Antimonial Wine, with great apparent good effect at bed∣time, as soon as the Phlogistic Diathesis had considerably abated.</P>
<P>THESE kind of Pleurisies are commonly brought on by intemperance and imprudent exposure to the Weather, which is very fluc∣tuating
<PB N="335" REF="024239_0341_0FC56C29B27E3D30"/>
during the Winter, and especially to∣wards the approach of Spring. Were the Inhabitants more cautious and attentive to these circumstances, they might in general escape the danger of this Disease. I have found the use of Flannel next to the skin an excellent prophylactic against the Diseases of the Winter and Spring season. I believe the Western and Hilly parts of this State are as healthful as any part of the world, and I am sure they are as pleasant in respect to Weather—But in the flat Country, in many parts of which there are whole Lakes of Stagnant Water constantly in a state of pu∣trefaction, the inhabitants are sadly afflicted with Disease; particularly with Intermittent and Remittent Fevers, frequently accompa∣nied with very extraordinary symptoms of debility, and bilious discharges, and often with Coma resembling the Apoplexy.

think it has been the salvation of multitudes in this Climate; an infusion of Calamus, Aromaticus, Snakeroot, and the bark of our live Oak is a Catholicon for the Ague among our Rice Planters.</P>
<P>THE countenances of the generality of the natives of this part of the State where I reside are pale and sallow. This appears to be occasioned by the excessive secretion of Bile, peculiar to warm Climates, and to Agu∣ish disorders.</P></Q>

<HEAD>EXTRACT of a LETTER from Dr. JO∣SEPH MILLER, dated Washington, on Tar River, August 17th, 1791.</HEAD>
<Q><P>CHILDREN are astonishingly subject to Worms in all the Towns in the low Coun∣try, and as far as I can learn in every Town to the Southward—The Hydrocephalus also occurs more frequently than is commonly supposed. I have never had an opportunity of opening any person who died of this Dis∣ease;
<PB N="338" REF="024239_0344_0FC56C32EB47AE70"/>
but from the best accounts which have been recorded, I am convinced that multi∣tudes of those who are thought to die of Worm Fevers, die of the Hydrocephalus. I am so fully persuaded of this, that I make it a rule always to compare the Diagnostic Symptoms of the one with those of the other before I attempt to prescribe; but as there are some Symptoms common to both, I am often at a loss—When the Patient has a dilatation of the pupil and convulsive mo∣tion of the Eye-lids, and squinting without an affection of the limbs, or frothing at the mouth, there can be little doubt that the Dis∣ease depends upon effusion or collection of Water within the Ventricles of the Brain; and more especially when the Patient often puts his hand to the head and shrieks out, or complains of pain there. But as the Pa∣tient grinds his teeth, shrieks out, and has a very irregular Fever in consequence of the irritation occasioned by Worms, especially when previously reduced by debilitating causes, I think it is a very difficult point to distinguish one Disease from the other.</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="024239_0345_0FC56C348AED8BE0"/>
THE cases of Hydrocephalus which I have taken particular notice of, began like irregular Remittents, and generally continu∣ed a Week or more before any Comatose Symptoms, Dilatations of the Pupils, Strabismus, or Spsams, came on; and before the decease of the Patient, a Paralysis of one side uniformly took place: The Sto∣mach and Bowels also seemed to lose their sensibility early in the complaint, which is seldom or never the case from Worms.</P>
<P>AS I have been unlucky in my prescrip∣tions and treatment of the Hydrocephalus, I will not trouble you with a detail of particu∣lars; but whenever I have been able to ascertain the presence of Worms, I have seldom failed removing them, by exhibiting a draught of a strong infusion of the Anthelmia, or Caryo∣phyllum Indicum, night and morning for three or four days, and afterwards a dose of Mercurius Dulcis and Rubarb, proportion∣ate to the Patients age. If any signs of Worms still remain, the same remedy ought to be re∣peated
<PB N="340" REF="024239_0346_0FC56C3B64430520"/>
after an interval of three or four days. The success of this method is almost incredi∣ble—I have never yet seen an instance where it was not effectual, whether the Patient had a Fever or not, when the principal Symp∣toms were manifestly occasioned by Worms. I generally direct One Drachm of the Roots, Stalks and Leaves to be infused four hours in half a pint of Boiling Water, and as much of it to be given with the addition of a little Milk and Sugar, as the Patient has been ac∣customed to take of Tea or Coffee for Break∣fast and Supper. The day the Mercurial purge is taken, the Patient is Prohibited cold drinks and solid Food. To confirm the cure, Huxham's Tincture is directed to be taken before Dinner, and a little Wine and Water made use of for common drink.</P>
<P>I HAVE tried Blisters frequently to the Occiput, Neck, and behind the Ears, in several cases of Hydrocephalus, and in every stage, and have raised a moderate Ptyalism, by the application of Mercurial Ointment to the
<PB N="341" REF="024239_0347_0FC56C3C80232BE8"/>
body without success; and yet I have no doubt of that method, with the addition of a Cordial Regimen, and the frequent application of hot Pediluvium, being the only one which has any probability of ever being of real ser∣vice. This opinion I ground on the success of others, as well as on the Pathology.</P></Q>

<HEAD>A SKETCH of the SITUATION, CLIMATE, and DISEASES of SOUTH-CAROLINA.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="excerpt">
<HEAD>[Extract of a Letter from the Honorable DAVID RAM∣SAY, Esq. dated Charleston, March 17, 1791.</HEAD>
<Q><HI>I HAVE not leisure sufficient to do justice to the subject you request, but this will be no disappointment as more has been written towards elucidating the Medical History of South-Ca∣rolina, than of almost any other State. I refer particularly to Dr. Lining's and Dr. Chalmer's Publications. I think the latter has exaggerated the heat of our Climate, and given a Gloomy representation of its Diseases, but that his Writings afford and Materials for your Work.</HI>]</Q>
<P>THIS State is in length about 200 miles, and in breadth 125, situate between 32 and 35 degrees of North Latitude.</P>
<Q><P>BOUNDED East by the Atlantic Ocean, North, by North-Carolina, Southwest and
<PB N="343" REF="024239_0349_0FC56C4055C5DE28"/>
South, by Savannah River, which divides it from Georgia.</P>
<P>THE coast of this Country is so low and flat, that it cannot be seen at the distance of more than Seven Leagues, but about 60 miles from the Shore, the land becomes more unequal, and consists of Spacious levels, inter∣terspersed with easy risings, which gradually, advancing in height towards the West, ter∣minate in a range of Lofty Mountains, that form, as it were, a chain which runs through∣out the Continent of North-America, at the distance of about 300 Miles from the Sea-Coast.</P></Q>
<P>FROM the East sides of these Mountains, many Rivers arise; and as all the Waters of the adjacent Lands fall into them, these Ri∣vers are liable to excessive inundations; swel∣ling sometimes more than 20 feet in height in the space of 12 hours, particularly in those places where the Channels are narrow, and the Banks sufficiently high to confine the
<PB N="344" REF="024239_0350_0FC56C44E8160DF0"/>
Waters. But where the Land is lower, the Waters overflow and spread themselves ma∣ny miles beyond their ordinary limits; and thus the low lands often continue deluged for many weeks.</P>
<P>THESE land-floods are owing either to the melting of Snow on the Mountains, or the falling of heavy Rains in the interior parts of the Country, and they sometimes happen both in the Spring and Autumn, but most frequently in the latter Season. Some years, however, (though these are rare) the Rivers do not swell at all, or in so small a degree as not to occasion any damage.</P>
<P>WHEN such inundations happen in the Spring, the Planters can not sow their grain; and in Autumn the produce of their lands is either swept away by the Stream, or so rotted, that little or nothing can be reaped for that year: However so prolific are those lands, that if one Crop is lost out of three, the Plan∣ters are sufficiently recompensed.</P>
<Q><PB N="345" REF="024239_0351_0FC56C4637A7D168"/>
<P>A GREAT part of the Rice Plantations are oceasionally overflowed by art, for the purpose of promoting the growth of the Rice, which is properly a Water-plant, at least when of a proper age it thrives best in Water. This has a salutary effect, as it pre∣vents the generation of putrid exhalations, the effect of stagnant, confined, and motion∣less waters when operated on by heat. In order to prepare such Lands, Dams, Banks and Drains are necessary.</P>
<P>THREE days before, and as many after every change and full of the Moon, the Sea flowing in with a stronger Current, and ri∣sing some feet higher in the Rivers, so far as the tide flows, checks the course of the Wa∣ter in them, and causes them to swell and overflow the Low Lands above.</P>
<P>ALONG the Banks of every River lies much Low Land, which is mostly covered at High-Water so far as the Tide flows. As far as the Sea Water flows these Banks are
<PB N="346" REF="024239_0352_0FC56C4873358EE0"/>
covered with an high and strong sedgy sort of Grass, like Wild Oats—and at a greater dis∣tance from the Sea, where the Waters are al∣ways Fresh, such Swampy Grounds abound with Coarse Grass, Reeds, and a vast variety of other productions, from the lofty Cypress to the humblest and most diminutive Plant. Besides these wet Lands, there are several Fresh Water Lakes in the interior parts of the Country, and great quantities of low le∣vel Ground, which after Heavy Rains, conti∣nue long overflowed for want of declivities by which the Waters might run off. When these Stagnant Waters are nearly or quite ex∣pended, noxious exhalations will abound; for then the Sun's Rays penetrating the Mi∣ry Soil, the corrupt, putrid and mephitic Matter which had lien quiescent is thereby set at liberty, and mixes with the Air we breathe. The Soil of this State is very va∣rious, being generally light and sandy with∣in 20 miles of the Sea. This refers only to the more elevated parts, for in many other places the Mould is rich and deep.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="024239_0353_0FC56C4A075EAC48"/>
THE quantity of Water which constantly Stagnates in various parts, occasions innu∣merable multitudes of Reptiles and Insects that are intollerably troublesome to the In∣habitants, more especially at night, unless they are guarded against by Gauze Curtains, or some other contrivance.</P>
<P>EXCEPT in one River, a stone larger than a pebble is not to be found any where within 20 miles of the Sea, exclusive of what has been brought in as Ballast for Ships.</P>
<P>WHEN the English first took possession of this Country, excepting Savannahs, (which are Plains naturally without Trees) and some small openings made by the Savages, the whole was one continued Forest; and per∣haps one 20th part of it is not yet cleared and cultivated. (Since the above account was published by Dr. Chalmers, which was about the year 1772, a much greater portion of this State has been cleared, and a consider∣able
<PB N="348" REF="024239_0354_0FC56C4F1CA5FFE8"/>
part of it is now (in 1791) in the high∣est cultivation.)</P>
<P>FROM the surfaces, therefore, of so many large Rivers, and numerous collections of standing Waters, such quantities of sunk, fenny, and marshy Lands, and the vast At∣lantic Ocean that borders on our Coast, it may readily be inferred, that excessive exha∣lations must be made in this Sultry Climate; to which may be added, the exuberant trans∣piration from the Soil, and of perspiration from Vegetable productions which every where cover the Ground.</P>
<P>THE extraordinary Moisture of this Cli∣mate is manifest from the quantity of Rain which falls at Charlestown, in the course of the year—This, at a medium for ten years, viz. from 1750 to 1760, was 42 inches an∣nually, exclusive of the Moisture that de∣scended in Fogs and Dews.</P>
<P>DEWS that are heavy shew an Atmos∣phere
<PB N="349" REF="024239_0355_0FC56C522472B428"/>
replete with Moisture: These are so great here in common Seasons, that those who are abroad at night, are presently wet and chilled by them—The Fogs are some∣times so great in Winter as to obscure the Sun for several days together.</P>
<P>DURING this damp Weather, Water may be seen pouring down Looking-Glasses, and whatever is painted: Candles burn dimly, the flames appearing as if surrounded with <HI>Halos;</HI> Marshy Grounds, Ditches, Sinks, and Shallow Standing Waters, emit an offensive Smell; and all things are render∣ed so Damp within doors where no Fires are kept, that on entering a House a musty dis∣agreeable smell is perceived, like that of the Chambers of those who are sweating in Fe∣vers.</P>
<P>AS we have no Hills nor Mountains near us to collect or to conduct the Currents of Air, the Wind seldom blows with much force, except in time of a Hurricane, which
<PB N="350" REF="024239_0356_0FC56C52F1DDF5F0"/>
happens but seldom, and at no stated periods; nor does such an outrageous Storm arise at all, unless the Winds have been small and the Weather very Hot and Dry for a consi∣derable time before: Hence it should seem, that the Air at last becomes so rarified as to permit the contiguous Denser Atmosphere to rush towards ours with great velocity as into an exhausted Receiver, in order to re∣store the Equilibrium.</P>
<P>ON these occasions the Storm always proceeds from the Northeast; this being the opposite point to that from whence the Wind had blown so long before.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the damages sus∣tained by Individuals on such occasions, the want of such tempests for many years toge∣ther is probably a great misfortune to us; because the Air does not receive sufficient Ventilation to be conducive to Health by any other means in this Climate: But till the Land is more cleared our Atmosphere can∣not
<PB N="351" REF="024239_0357_0FC56C5AA1C69F28"/>
be wholly renewed even by a Hurricane; because the Wind cannot penetrate such an extent of close Woods, which are even im∣pervious to the Sun's Rays, and where the Air contracts a mephitic quality by close confinement, and the impregnation of the fixed Air, after it has been set at liberty by the putrefaction of decaying Vegetables, &amp;c. It is therefore probable that the generality of the Land Winds rather tend to vitiate than to purify the Air with which they come in contact, and that the Winds which come from the Sea are the only ones that purify it at present.</P>
<P>OUR Air is liable to as sudden and great changes in its temperature as can possibly happen in any Country; but fortunately the greatest variations are from Warm and Moist, to Cold and Clear Weather. These extraordinary vicissitudes are most frequent in <HI>Winter</HI> and <HI>Spring;</HI> though in <HI>Autumn</HI> the difference between the Heat of the Day and Night often exceeds 20 Degrees.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="024239_0358_0FC56C5BC6C40A58"/>
FROM the comparatively greater cool∣ness and Moisture of the Air at Night it probably is, that when the Weather is Calm, during the Autumn, and even later, the whole Country will be covered with a thick Fog. For as the Earth retains the Heat it received from the Sun in the Day longer than the Atmosphere does, it still emits Vapours, which cannot ascend to any considerable height, because of the Colder Air above; and as the humidity that was before diffused aloft, is then made to coalesce and fall lower, by its gravity being thus augmented, they together form those Dense Clouds which hang, as it were, balanced between the Cool∣er Medium above and the Warmer one be∣low. But as the Heat of the Soil abates more the longer the Sun has been absent, these Clouds descend still lower, till they co∣ver the face of the Earth in such a manner, that in the Morning the largest objects are intercepted from our view sometimes at the distance of 20 yards: But even then, should we look out of a Window up two pair of
<PB N="353" REF="024239_0359_0FC56C5CC03DFB30"/>
Stairs, though the Gound below us can not be seen, the Air is perfectly serene at that height. The surrounding higher prospects then appear Roma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ic, and the whole looks like Enchantment. For as only the tops of the Trees and Houses can be seen▪ they seem to grow and stand, as it were, in the middle of a Great Ocean, which the Fog resembles.</P>
<P>THIS scene will continue till the Va∣pours are exhaled by the Sun, or dissipated by the Wind, which commonly happens by 10 o'Clock, A. M. or earlier, and the whole will be dispersed before noon, unless the Wea∣ther continues quite calm.</P>
<P>LIGHTNING and Thunder happen at all Seasons when it Rains immediately after a shift of Wind; but from April to Septem∣ber we seldom have a Shower without both, though they are generally most dreadful in June, July, and August.</P>
<P><PB N="354" REF="024239_0360_0FC56C5E35D22708"/>
I CAN not convey a better idea of the Heat we perceive in passing along the Streets at Noon in the Summer than by com∣paring it to that glow which strikes one who looks into a pretty warm oven; for it is so increased by reflection from the houses and Sandy Streets as sometimes to raise the Mer∣cury to the 130th degree on Farenheit's Thermometer, when the temperature of the shaded Air may not exceed the 94th.</P>
<P>THE sudden Death and excessive pu∣trefaction of a Dog which was shut up in a Sugar Baker's Stove, where the Mercury rose to the 146th Degree, led Dr. Boerhaave into some mistakes with respect to the ef∣fects of Heat on living Animals, which al∣most every year are contradicted by experi∣ence in this Climate. The Creature which was the subject of this experiment, did not die of Heat alone, but rather of the rarity of the Air, and the mephitical qualities it con∣tracted in the Stove for want of the admissi∣on of fresh Air.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="024239_0361_0FC56C66C1198268"/>
FOR we are assured, that on several occa∣sions a still greater degree of heat is sustained by Mankind, and for a longer time together<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Dr. Zimmerman in his Geographical History of Man, in∣forms us, that "Man, and Man alone, is formed to resist the two extremes of Heat and Cold, and that he lives and conti∣nues healthy under all the variations of temperature, from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>32 of natural Cold, to the 130th Degree of natural Heat."</P>
<P>SEE also the account of Dr. George Fordyce's Experiments in Duncan's Commentaries; and the account of the Climate of Russia by Dr. Guthrie, in the Royal Transactions of Edin∣burgh, Vol. 2d.</P>
<P>"IN Siberia, A. D. 1772, the Cold was so extreme on the 7th of December, that the Mercury sunk to 80° below 0, and some days afterwards it froze in the Ball, which according to the best experiments requires 370° below 0, to be completely congealed."</P>
<P>ON Churchill's River, in Hudson's-Bay, Brandy could not be preserved from freezing in the closest rooms. In Senegal, which is situated in 17 Degrees N. L. the Mercury rose to 108 1/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>° in the Shade, and near the Coast, to 117 1/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>°. The Ne∣groes often sustain a Heat of 120°.</P>
<P>Dr. BLAGDEN resisted the Heat when raised to 48° above that of Boiling Water for the space of 8 minutes.</P>
<P>DUHAMEL and TILLET give an account of some French Girls who supported a Heat of 175° in an Oven without any injurious effects for more than ten minutes.</P></NOTE> without any immediate danger to life.</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="024239_0362_0FC56C6821484380"/>
FEW days pass throughout the year in which we do not see the Sun, and the Wea∣ther for the most p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t is so moderate in the Winter Season, that Candles burn steadily in the open Balconies on nights of public re∣joicing.</P>
<P>IT seldom freezes more than four or five times in the above Season; but then a thaw so soon succeeds, that in the space of Ten Years the ice may not be strong enough to bear a Man's weight. It is unusual to see the Ground covered with Snow; and when this does happen, it seldom lies more than 24 hours.</P>
<P>HOAR Frosts are, however, frequent in Winter, and Hail with the Summer Showers, as <HI>Halos</HI> are at all seasons.</P>
<P>THE lowest station of the Thermometer for the last 10 years has been 18, and the highest 101.</P>
<P><PB N="357" REF="024239_0363_0FC56C6C31DA8AF0"/>
THE difference in the range of the Ba∣rometer, for the space of 15 years, was not more than 1.22 Inches. Very warm Air, or the flame of a Candle held near the tube, will cause the Mercury to rise in the Baro∣meter, and East or Northerly Winds do the same, but it subsides with a South or West Wind.—"This Instrument seems rather to indicate the density or elasticity of the At∣mosphere than the weight thereof. Of this, many proofs might be given, but they do not belong to this place."</P></Q>

<HEAD>CHARLESTOWN.</HEAD>
<P>THE Metropolis of South Carolina stands in the Latitude of 32° 45, and about 4° West of Philadelphia, and 79 from Lon∣don, on a W. S. W. Course. This Town is built on a narrow Peninsula, which is formed by the conflux of Ashley and Cooper Rivers, which are broad and deep, and dis∣charge
<PB N="358" REF="024239_0364_0FC56C6D3ABA1A78"/>
their Waters into the Ocean about six Miles below the Town.</P>
<P>IN these Rivers is a rapid Flood and Ebb, and the Tide in common rises and falls about five feet, but at New and Full Moon seven Feet. As the Gulph of Florida runs with a swift Current towards the Northeast, at the distance of about 15 or 20 Leagues from this Coast, it will be readily under∣stood why a strong N. E. Wind should al∣ways make a High Tide in those Rivers, as by directly opposing that Stream, it is made to recoil on the Coast of Carolina, and thus causes the Rivers to Swell.</P>
<P>THREE sides of this Town are washed by the above Rivers; the Ground between them being so Low and Level, that it is not seven feet, nor is the Country for 20 Miles in circumference 10 feet higher at a Medium, than the surface of full Sea is at Spring-Tides.</P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="024239_0365_0FC56C6EE71CCD58"/>
THIS is both a healthy and an agreeable situation in such a Climate, for it stands, as it were, in a large Plain, having a Sea open to it in front, and washed by the waters of two spacious Rivers on either side. Some of the Streets are conveniently wide, but most of them are much too narrow.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"NARROW Lanes and Alleys should be prohibited by the Police in every City, for those confined situations are the com∣mon sources in which the most infectious and malignant dis∣tempers are engendered."</NOTE> Besides their being a Nursery for various Disorders from their confined situation, they have been found ex∣tremely inconvenient in cases of Fires, the de∣structive effects of which have been frequent∣ly felt in this City. The Streets, however, from East to West, extend from River to Ri∣ver, and running in a straight line, not only open beautiful prospects each way, but af∣ford excellent opportunities by means of subterranean Drains for removing all nuisan∣ces, and keeping the City clean.</P>
<P><PB N="360" REF="024239_0366_0FC56C70DBB4FCB0"/>
WHEN the South Wind blows, it is al∣ways Warm and Moist, because it comes from the Warmer Latitudes, and sweeps over a great extent of Sea; that which comes from the Southwest and West is Sultry and Moist in Summer, because it passes over large spaces of heated, marshy, overflowed, or Wood Lands, and in Winter it brings Damps or Rain, being fraught with the ex∣halations that are made from the above Soils, as well as by those Vapours that are collected and condensed by the high bleak Moun∣tains that lie behind. On the contrary, the Northwest and North Winds are Cool and refreshing in the Summer, but Chilling in Winter, and at all Seasons they dispel Clouds and Fogs by their pure elastic pressure.</P>
<P>IN the Summer Months, a <HI>Southeast</HI> Wind commonly springs up about 10 o'Clock A. M. which is called the <HI>Sea Breeze;</HI> this begins very gently, but gradually increases
<PB N="361" REF="024239_0367_0FC56C74BA55E238"/>
in strength, and fans briskly till 6 or 7 in the evening, when it gradually abates, and ceases before night. About 8 o'Clock at night a small Westerly Wind arises and continues till the same hour next Morning, and then ceases likewise—After a pause of about two hours, the Sea Breeze sets in again as be∣fore, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE WATER.</HEAD>
<P>THE Water in common use for Drink∣ing and Cooking at Charlestown is always Brackish. Fifty-five cubical Inches of this Water was found to weigh Six Grains more than an equal Bulk of Rain Water; and when the same weight of Sea Salt was ad∣ded to the Rain Water, it precipitated a Solution of Silver when mixed with Spirits of Nitre, became of a Milky colour with Oil of Tartar per deliquium, and tasted like the Well-Water.</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="024239_0368_0FC56C8116AC5A10"/>
THE manner of living in Charlestown is much after the English fashion; but either weak and acid Punch, or Rum and Water, is used by many for constant Drink, and Peo∣ple in easy circumstances make too liberal use of Wine, particularly at and after Din∣ner, to the great injury of their Constitu∣tions.</P>
<P>TEA and Coffee are also so cheap, that one or other is used twice a-day by people of all descriptions; for want of Markets in the Country, more Salted and Smoaked Meats are consumed by the People there than in the Town; they, however, abound with Poultry, Milk, wholesome bread, made of Maize or Rice, and the most delicious Fruits.</P>
<Q><P>CHARLESTOWN, increases fast in build∣ings and People;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. CHALMERS account of Charlestown was published in 1772: Since that time it has increased rapidly; for by Mor∣se's Geography, it appears that there were in 1786, 1600 Houses in the City, with 9600 White Inhabitants, and 5400 Negroes, and that upwards of 200 of the White Inhabitants were above 60 years of age.</NOTE> but at present there are not
<PB N="363" REF="024239_0369_0FC56C855BD09EE8"/>
quite 1200 dwelling houses, with nearly as many kitchens that are built separate, besides a great number of Warehouses.</P>
<P>THE White Inhabitants of this Town may be about 5500; but the mortality amnog them cannot be exactly determined at pre∣sent, no Register thereof having been kept for several years: Formerly when Bills of Mortality were annually printed, the Inha∣bitants then being not quite 4000, it appear∣ed that one in 37 died annually, or about one in each family in the space of 7 years and an half.</P>
<P>IT must be acknowledged that we are more healthy than formerly, since the Hur∣ricanes of 1752. Children in particular have escaped better since; for before that time, almost half the deaths happened a∣mongst
<PB N="364" REF="024239_0370_0FC56C86EC72B920"/>
those who were under five years of age.</P>
<P>BIRTHS cannot be ascertained from the Christenings; for Children are not always Baptized the same year in which they are born; but it is certain, they far exceed the deaths of the settled Inhabitants.</P>
<P>THE natives, for the most part, rise a∣bove the middling stature, and they attain their full height sooner than people usu∣ally do in Colder Climates. In general they are of a slender make, have pale com∣plexions, thin lank hair, which seldom curls: Few live 60 years, and the bald, or hoary, and wrinkled appearances of old age, often shew themselves at the age of 30 years, or even ear∣lier, more especially on those who dwell in the Country.</P></Q>

<HEAD>Dr. CHALMERS Account of the state of the Thermometer in the Shaded Air, at Charlestown, in the year 1752.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>FROM Dr. John Lining's Letter to Dr. Robert Whytt, it appears, that in the beginning of August, of the year 1748, the weather was warmer at Charlestown than he had ever known it in that month: The Mercury for some days at 2 o'Clock, rose, in the Shaded Air, to the 96th Degree, at which time several died of Apoplexies.</P>
<P>THE latter part of August, and the first week in September, were much more temperate; the weather being then much as usual at that season of the year.</P>
<P>THE second week in September was Cold, the Wind being constantly Easterly, and the weather cloudy.</P>
<P>IN the latter part of September, and from the 1st to the 18th of October, the greatest heat at 2 P.M. was 79°, and the lowest Degree of heat, during that time at the same hour, was 52°, the greatest nocturnal heat was 71°, the least 42°.</P>
<P>THE greatest increase of heat in 24 hours, was 17°, the greatest decrease of the same was 22°.</P>
<P>IN all the month of September, and in the greatest part of October, the Wind was Easterly.</P></NOTE>

<P>THE foregoing tables shew a consider∣able difference in the temperature of our Air, and this may in part account for the chan∣ges that are brought about in our Constitu∣tions. If the Thermometer, exposed to the Sun during our hottest weather, was compared with the greatest Winter's Cold, the difference might be 100 degrees.</P>
<P>WHY the method of keeping a Register with two Glasses, the one exposed to the Sun∣shine and the other Kept in the shade, is not attended to I know not; for the mediums of both, taken together, would, in my opi∣nion,

<P>THOUGH much moisture is always present in the Air in this Climate, yet it increases with heat; for it Rains as much (as appears by Registers which I have kept of the wea∣ther for 10 years) in Summer as in the Win∣ter and Spring taken together, and still more Rain falls in the Autumn.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">FROM a comparison of the Tables of Meteorological obser∣vations made at Charlestown with those made at Jamaica, which is situated between 3 and 4 degrees within the Tropic of Cancer, the Climate of the latter appears much more salutary as well as more agreeable than the former.—"IN the West-Indies, during the six months of the year, when the Sun has passed the Equinoctial line on his annual re∣turn to either Tropic, that Season is called the Summer; so from the 20th of March, when the Sun passes the Equator into the Northern Hemisphere to visit the tropic of Cancer, until the 21st of September, when he repasses it into the Southern Hemisphere to re-visit the tropic of Capricorn, it is considered the Summer Season in the West-Indies, and the remainder of the year is called Winter. Within the tropics the heat is nearly uniform, seldom varying on any given spot, either by Day or Night 16 degrees: At a medium, on the Coast, and on Plains not much elevated above the level of the Sea, the Heat is about 80 of Farenheit's, or 21 of Reaumer's Thermometer; and the difference between the Heat of January, the coldest month, and of August the hottest month of the year, is seldom above 6 degrees; but between the Heat of the Morning and Noon, the difference is 16°. The Rains begin in April or May, and continue 6 or 8 weeks—and again in September, when they are violent and heavy; but when the Sun arrives at the tropic of Capricorn, its greatest Southern distance on the 21st of December, the season becomes dry and pleasant, ac∣companied with Night Winds from the Land." <HI>(Mosely, on Tropical Diseases.</HI></NOTE></P></Q>

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> distribution of the months into seasons does not appear suitable for this Climate. For certain it is, that taking the
<PB N="370" REF="024239_0376_0FC56C9E19051338"/>
whole of the month of March together with respect to the temperature and qualities of the Air, it does not differ much from some of those that are called Winter Months; it is, however, retained here in compliance with established custom as belonging to the Spring, though the medium of the Thermometer be 10 degrees less than it is in April.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">IN Muschenbrocks Element's of Natural Philosophy, it is said that in all the countries within the tropics, the greatest de∣gree of heat rises only to 88 or 90, and the lowest falls to 72 or 70.</NOTE></P>
<P>THOUGH we might expect the Spring should be the most wholesome season of the four in this Climate, because the Air is then impregnated with exhilirating and refreshing exhalations issuing from a boundless variety of Vegetables just emerging into life; yet we find it is less so than Winter "with his Ruf∣fian Blasts," owing to the sudden and ex∣treme Vicissitudes of the weather, especially in the early part of that gay season.</P>
<P><PB N="371" REF="024239_0377_0FC56C9F775BCC78"/>
IT is, however, much more wholesome than the latter part of Summer and Autumn, when the weather becomes not only more variable than it was before, but the Atmos∣phere also becomes loaded with exhalations from deciduous and putrifying Vegetables, as well as from the innumerable bodies of Insects, and other Animals, which having answered the ends of their generation, are now dying in all corners, and which as well as the Miasmata exhaled from Marshes and Lakes, unless dissipated with High Winds, contribute to poison the principle of life.</P></Q>

<HEAD>The DISEASES of MARCH and APRIL.</HEAD>
<Q><P>ALTHOUGH the weather be much Warmer in March than it is in the preceding Month it is still changeable, as being in∣termixed
<PB N="372" REF="024239_0378_0FC56CA3917F04E8"/>
with Cold, Windy, and Warm days, in which the Mercury sometimes rises nearly to the 80th degree, and falls in a few days to the 40th; the contrary also often happens in a short space of time.</P>
<P>PLEURISIES, Peripneumonies, Quinsies, and Catarrhous Fevers are often epidemic this month, and often continue throughout the month of April, but with a less degree of inflammation.</P>
<P>WHEN one person in a family sickens, and the Disease cannot be removed in a few days, nothing is more common than for some of the attendants to be seized in the same way. This gives an alarm to their neighbours, who conclude the Disease to be infectious, than which there is nothing more foreign, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it is owing to the similarity of Constitu∣tions which now prevails, and to greater ex∣posure than common to the remote causes. For those who depart from their customary
<PB N="373" REF="024239_0379_0FC56CA4B138BD10"/>
manner of living are most in danger of Dis∣eases at all times. This is particularly the case of Nurses, who are obliged to go often out of a warm room into the cold Air at all hours, and are often deprived of their rest, &amp;c.</P>
<P>WHEN the Patient had a Cough and Spit∣ting before he was seized with a Peripneu∣mony at this time, the expectoration will ge∣nerally be pretty free on the 2d or 3d day of the Disease provided care has been taken; and it also will be more plentiful than it was in the like disorder during the three preceding months—The blood too being of a laxer consistence than is commonly observed when drawn in the month of February, shews signs of less inflammation; for though a pellicle of Coagulable lymph may still appear, yet this will be thinner and not so tough as in the preceding month.</P>
<P>YOUTH are observed to be more liable to
<PB N="374" REF="024239_0380_0FC56CAAE99ADD18"/>
inflammatory complaints in March and April than at any other time of the year; and though the Fevers which occur at this time are mostly attended, and perhaps depend upon catarrhal affections at first, they generally remit, and frequently become Quotidian In∣termittents in a few days if properly mana∣ged; else they may continue till the 7th, or longer, and a delirium, bleeding from the nose, or both, may be frequent in them. Du∣ring these two months the two last menti∣ed symptoms are not uncommon in Pneumo∣nic affections.</P>
<P>WHEN the weather is warmer at this time, Women, and weakly Men have Fevers, with some degree of Cough and Pain in the side or breast; but they remit from the beginning, and in a few days end in Quotidians, in which much Bile is sometimes discharged upwards at the beginning of the Paroxisms.</P>
<P>THE Gout and Rheumatism, Serous, or
<PB N="375" REF="024239_0381_0FC56CAC35190098"/>
inflammatory Quinsies, and the Erisipelas also appear at this time; the latter in parti∣cular oftener than at any other time of the year. The Essera likewise is not unfrequent, but it happens mostly in the first attacks of Intermittents—It also sometimes happens without any Fever, and is very troublesome.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>(ACCORDING to the account of Tourn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ourt, the Cynanche Maligna, which he calls the Child's Plague, was first imported into Europe from the Levant 60 years before the period of his observations, which were published 30 or 40 years ago.)

<PB N="376" REF="024239_0382_0FC56CB022944798"/>
years past till lately, I believe it is not a Dis∣ease of this Climate.</P>
<P>A COMPLICATED and very acute com∣plaint appeared here in the month of Octo∣ber, 1770, which was said to have passed hither from Georgia, where many people di∣ed of it; besides the common symptoms which appear at the commencement of the generality of Fevers, a Quinsy generally ap∣peared at the beginning, with great inflam∣mation of the Velum, Uvula, and Tonsils; and quickly spreading to the Eustachian tube—and in those who recovered (as most of them did) the inflammation extended to the throat, from the throat to the Alae Nasi, which soon became ulcerated, and a vast dis∣charge issued from the Nostrils, at which time the voice was hoarse, indistinct, and snuffling.</P>
<P>THE tongue in many was greatly swelled, and extended insomuch as to hang out of the mouth. After the inflammation had
<PB N="377" REF="024239_0383_0FC56CB4CB4BFF90"/>
continued a few days, the fauces and Uvula became ulcerated, and appeared of a brigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pearl, or dusky brown colour.</P>
<P>THE Gargarisms I used in such cases were decoctions of Peruvian and Oak Bark, with a small proportion of Serpentaria, to which Red Wine, Tincture of Myrrh, or Bran∣dy, were added; and they were likewise acidulated with Spirits of Vitriol or Alum, always in a greater or less proportion as the condition of the Ulcers appeared to require. Half a spoonful of the same composition was also directed to be often swallowed both to cleanse the throat, and give tone to the sys∣tem.</P>
<P>AT the beginning of this complaint, Blis∣tering across the throat, and the back part of the neck, and receiving the steams of hot wa∣ter and Vinegar into the throat, was of sen∣sible service. As soon as the activity of the Pulse began to abate, the Bark, in Powder,
<PB N="378" REF="024239_0384_0FC56CB5F5CC6E30"/>
was exhibited liberally, mixed with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣bove decoction, &amp;c.</P>
<P>WHEN the Inflammatory Symptoms ap∣peared considerable, the Lancet was always employed, and apparently with real benefit.</P>
<P>VERY few who were affected with this species of Quinsy escaped without having both Scarlet and Miliary eruptions, which generally appeared on the 2d or 3d day of the Fever. And it is remarkable, that they who had the two latter complaints in a co∣pious manner, for the most part, suffered less from the Angina. In those who had fre∣quent Vomitings, and large Watery stools, the danger was very great.—These were therefore endeavoured to be restrained by Opiates, Warm Spirituous fomentations, and hot applications to the Body and Limbs.</P></Q>
<P>OUR Constitutions become so changed towards the end of April, provided the Sea∣son
<PB N="379" REF="024239_0385_0FC56CBA273DC2D8"/>
be but regularly Warm, that Fevers prove either Quotidians, or Tertians at once; and are often times attended with Bilious discharges both ways.</P>
<P>THE long continuance of hot weather ne∣ver fails to relax and debilitate the Solids in the same manner as if they had been over distended.</P>
<P>THOSE who have swelled Spleens, or the Jaundice; pale Girls and Women who have defective Menses, are liable to hemorrhages from the nose or lungs, more especially du∣ring Fevers.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>DISEASES of MAY and JUNE.</HEAD>
<P>IT may be observed that those complaints which depend upon a <HI>Weakened tone</HI> of the <HI>Solids,</HI> and a <HI>loss</HI> of <HI>Harmony</HI> between the Nervous and Sanguiferous Systems (which is presumed to be the case in Intermittent, and
<PB N="380" REF="024239_0386_0FC56CBB31F1E768"/>
Remittent Fevers, Choleras, Dysenteries, &amp;c.) begin to make their appearance here early in the Summer, when the preceding months have been warm and moist, a state of the At∣mosphere which never fails to induce that state of the System favourable to the opera∣tion of their remote causes.</P>

<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>DISEASES of OCTOBER and NOVEMBER.</HEAD>
<P>DISEASES of a mixed kind, or between the Inflammatory (or rather mild Inflamma∣tory Diseases which appear in these months soon terminate in Remittents or Intermit∣tents) and Intermitting are seen in October and November, and also (as should have been observed before) in March and April; at which time our Constitutions are as it were in a middling state with regard to ten∣sity and laxity.</P>
<P>IN Winter again, when the weather is
<PB N="382" REF="024239_0388_0FC57C79B9D5F050"/>
clear and cold, the Solids being then springy and tense, and the constituent particles of the blood more intimately united, Intermit∣ting Fevers are seldom seen, having given place to other Diseases of an opposite nature; unless the weather be unseasonably warm.</P>
<P>HENCE it appears, that the strength or weakness of our bodies keeps pace with the weather; and that they do not pass to either extreme all at once, but rather by degrees, or according as the Air changes in its tempera∣ture at different seasons of the year; so that these do not succeed each other suddenly, but with a gradual progress, our Constitutions conforming thereto, whether the transition be from cold to hot, or the contrary. The truth of this reasoning, every observant per∣son may perceive, by an increase or abate∣ment of his own strength, and the difference that of course happens in the Diseases of the several seasons.</P>
<Q><P>THOUGH one day of bad weather may
<PB N="383" REF="024239_0389_0FC57C7B281C91E8"/>
produce various complaints, yet before any (Epidemic, or) popular disease can take place, (setting aside those that are contagious or in∣fectious, that is, those whose remote cause is a specific poison received into the body by the Lungs or Absorbent Vessels over the sur∣face of the body) the air for a considerable continuance of time must have been of some certain temperature and quality, or nearly so, and then a sudden change must take place in that temperature before it can produce a mor∣bid change in the functions of the body. And as these effects are brought about sooner or later, according as other causes have concurred in rendering one constitution more infirm or susceptible of impression, or they be more or less exposed to the weather so changed, they may sicken in great numbers nearly at the same time, or in a more scattered manner one after another, though then a strong similarity may, in many respects, be observed in most cases.</P>
<P>WHEN the season is very inconstant, a
<PB N="384" REF="024239_0390_0FC57C7DF722CAB8"/>
variety of complaints and confusion in their symptoms generally ensue, according to the state the body happens to be in when act∣ed upon by such a shifting mixture of differ∣ent impressions; and then the observation of Hippocrates is likely to be verified, "That all diseases happen at all seasons.</P></Q>
<P>I have remarked that the returns<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This corresponds with what Dr. Cullen has observed with respect to the times of accession of the different varieties of Intermittents. Vol. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. p. 59.</P>
<P>"Quotidians come on in the morning, Tertians at noon, and Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>artans in the afternoon."</P></NOTE> of pe∣riodical disorders, and the symptoms of those that are of the more continued sort, conform in a good measure in their accession or times of attacking, with such parts of the 24 hours, as come nearest to the temperature of those seasons to which these several complaints seem, as it were, properly to belong. Thus, if the morning be supposed the Spring, noon the Summer, evening the Autumn, and night the Winter of the day, as the parallel will run
<PB N="385" REF="024239_0391_0FC57C83AB917140"/>
very nearly when the weather is settled; vernal disorders ought to commence or be increased in the forenoon, and abate towards the even∣ing, or in the forepart of the night; those of the Summer should invade towards noon and decline in the evening; but at whatever time they return, their symptoms will certainly be heightened in the middle of the day. On the other hand, Autumnal disorders should attack or be aggravated about 4 or 5 o'clock, P. M. And such disorders as are common to the Winter, either come on or are much increased in violence at the beginning of the night, and remit or go off towards morning, continuing more moderate till the next even∣ing, unless the weather be very cold.</P>
<P>THE disorders of the first period, are not so certain in their onsets and exacerbations; but for the most part a striking agreement will often be perceived in them.</P>
<P>EXCEPTING the Plica and a few such od∣dities, the people of South-Carolina are liable
<PB N="386" REF="024239_0392_0FC57C84F6BCBDB8"/>
to all the disorders that are to be found else∣where, or which can arise in constitutions, that are differently modified in the various seasons of the year. The endemic diseases of this place are common to other warm cli∣mates.</P>
<P>THE Tetanus appears here at all seasons, more especially from wounds or ulcers of the tendinous parts, and to this disease new-born infants are very liable; nor have I known more than one out of many hundreds of them recovered from it.</P>
<P>EXCEPT during the winter, varieties of the Intermitting Fever are common at all times; and periodical pains in different parts, particularly in the head; many persons being daily more or less affected with it, owing to an Atony and want of a perfect balance be∣tween the heart and extreme vessels, the lat∣ter appearing from the paleness and coldness of the skin to be spasmodically constricted: such people have seldom a natural warmth in
<PB N="387" REF="024239_0393_0FC57C88D6D69E60"/>
their hands, much less in their legs and feet: Menorrhagiae, Abortion, and Prolapsus Uteri, and other sexual diseases are very common and generally alarming.</P>
<P>FROM a want of excitement in the nervous sy∣stem, or from an Atonia of the sanguiferous ves∣sels, and a diminished momentum of the blood, congestions of the fluids, or obstructions of the Viscera, especially of the Spleen, are fre∣quent in the Autumn, as are local and general Dropsies and Hernias, and few adults have es∣caped the Piles, some people being daily more or less troubled with them: The Scurvy in a mild degree is also very common here; the gums first become spungy, and are soon de∣stroyed, so that the sockets of the teeth being thereby exposed to the air, they become cari∣ous, and not only useless but painful. The Rheumatism may be deemed one of our periodical diseases; the Gout too is a frequent and unwelcome guest with the opulent and luxurious.</P>
<P><PB N="388" REF="024239_0394_0FC57C8D66644EE0"/>
WHATEVER be the nature of that humour or matter which communicates the Lues Ve∣nerea, the Yaws and the Lame Distemper, or Joint Evil, called in the West-Indies the Ca∣cobia, whose direful effect are to destroy the smaller joints first, and afterwards the larger ones, all seem owing to somewhat, not very dissimilar; for they all three terminate nearly in the same manner when not properly ma∣naged or when left to take their own course, and appear to be curable almost in the same manner.</P>
<P>THE Trismus, or Jaw-Lock, is very com∣mon among negro infants soon after birth, and is supposed to be occasioned by the heat and smoke of the cabins in which they are born, and subsequent exposure to cold and damp air. Children are very much infested with worms in Charlestown.</P>
<P>BUT as the remedies generally employed are in no respect different from those employ∣ed
<PB N="389" REF="024239_0395_0FC57C8EAE337038"/>
in other countries, I shall not transcribe them here.</P>
<P>DR. Lining says, "The Yellow Fever has been four times epidemical in Charles∣town, viz. in the Autumn of 1732,—39,—45,—48; and as none of those were remark∣able for extraordinary heat or rainy weather, he concludes that it did not take its origin from any peculiarity of the climate or soil, but that it was imported from the West-In∣dies; and even asserts that whenever the disease appeared, it was easily traced to some person who had lately arrived from the West-India islands, where it was epidemi∣cal."</P>
<P>BUT from a comparison of the description which he gives of the symptoms of this fever, with that given by Dr. Chalmers, and particularly from the more recent obser∣vations of Dr. Hunter in the West-Indies, I am inclined to think Dr. Lining has
<PB N="390" REF="024239_0396_0FC57C9271EF1C90"/>
fallen into a very great error respecting the nature and cause of this disease.</P>
<P>FOR the greater yellowness of the skin ap∣pears to be the only circumstance in which it differs from the bilious Remittents of hot cli∣mates, or very hot seasons of any climate. Dr. Lining himself, though he considers it as a species of pestilence, says, the negroes were exempt from it, though exposed as much as the whites, and that those who were convey∣ed to the country with it never communicated it to those with whom they had communi∣cation.</P>
<P>THE celebrated Dr. Lind of Haslar Hos∣pital, appears to have fallen into a similar error, owing to the misrepresentation of facts by Dr. Warren and others.</P>
<P>HE has also recorded an account of the Yellow Fever becoming epidemic in Phila∣delphia, in the year 1740, owing to some in∣fected apparel of a gentleman who had died
<PB N="391" REF="024239_0397_0FC57C93EE5C8BA8"/>
of it in Barbadoes. These cloaths, says he, being unluckily hung abroad to be aired, pre∣sently diffused the contagion of the same fe∣ver over that part of the town, and destroyed 200 persons.</P>
<P>IT is however at present generally known (for it has been proved by the most accurate and unexceptionable observations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the papers of the benevolent Mr. Howard on Laza∣rettos, p. 36. Mertin's history of the Plague at Moscow, in 1771. See also the travels of Mr. Bruce, 3d vol. quarto, p. 717 and 18.</NOTE>) that no infectious disease can be communicated with∣out contact, or the near approach to the body of an infected person, or to somites or sub∣stances imbued with infectious matter or morbific Miasmata.</P>
<P>EVEN the Pestilence, the most contagious of all diseases, is not communicable by the air, without contact, or the near approach to an infected person, or to some substance which has imbibed the infectious matter: And it is
<PB N="392" REF="024239_0398_0FC57C97D1BA8360"/>
more than probable that the Pestilence is only a more violent degree of the Typhus or Pu∣trid Fever, modified and rendered more vio∣lent by climate, situation, manner of living, and constitution.</P>

<HEAD>of the SITUATION, CLIMATE, and DISEASES of GEORGIA.</HEAD>
<HEAD>THE following is the substance of accounts received from different correspondents respect∣ing the Situation, Climate, and Diseases of Georgia.</HEAD>
<P>THE state of Georgia lies between the 31st and 35th degree of north latitude; com∣puted to be about 600 miles in length, and 250 in breadth. Bounded east by the Atlantic, west by the Missisippi, north by South-Carolina, and south by Florida.</P>
<P>IT is separated from South-Carolina by the river Savannah, and from Florida by the river St. Mary.</P>
<P>AUGUSTA, the present seat of government, is situated on the Savannah river, about 135
<PB N="394" REF="024239_0400_0FC57C9C2BAC8AC0"/>
miles from its entrance into the ocean. The town of Savannah, on the same river, which is only 17 miles from its mouth, stands upon an elevated steep bank, and back of it lies an extensive gravelly plain.</P>
<P>THE north side of the river on the Carolina shore is a mere bog, from whence numerous exhalations constantly rise in warm weather, and by which the inhabitants of the town often suffer when the wind is north or north-east.</P>
<P>THE town last mentioned contains about 250 families. The number of inhabitants in the whole state, according to the return pre∣sented to Congress, October 28th, 1791, a∣mounted to 82548.</P>
<P>AUGUSTA at present is a very inconsiderable village; but from its favourable situation at the head of navigation, and the productive quality of the soil of the adjacent country, it cannot fail
<PB N="395" REF="024239_0401_0FC57C9DC4747508"/>
of rising into consequence in the course of a few years.</P>
<P>THE Savannah is fanned every day in Sum∣mer by refreshing breezes from the sea; Au∣gusta is deprived of this advantage by its in∣land situation.</P>
<P>FROM June to September the mercury com∣monly fluctuates between 76° and 85° in the shaded air, but is often as high as 90, and sometimes 100, especially forty or fifty miles from the sea.</P>
<P>IN winter it sometimes descends below 17°, but is very seldom below 32°. It commonly ranges at this season from 40 to 60°.</P>
<P>THE most prevailing winds here in Sum∣mer are south-west or east, and in Winter the north-west.</P>
<P>THE east wind is the warmest in Winter, and the coolest in Summer.</P>
<P><PB N="396" REF="024239_0402_0FC57CA224A71650"/>
THE south, which prevails too frequently for the health of the inhabitants, is damp, sultry, inelastic and oppressive, at all seasons, but amazingly so in the Summer and Autumn.</P>
<P>ABOUT a fifth part of this state is as level as a floor, particularly all that tract which lies between the rivers Savannah and St. Mary, extending 40 miles west. This tract being intersected with numerous rivers, along the banks of which is one continued marsh, the cleared ground is converted into Rice and Indigo plantations. It other respects the country exhibits precisely the same appearance as South-Carolina.</P>
<P>ABOUT 70 or 80 miles to the westward, the land begins to be more or less uneven, ri∣sing from small ridges into hills, and the hills successively increasing in height till they fi∣nally terminate in lofty mountains.</P>
<P>THAT vast chain of mountains which com∣mences with Kattskill, near Hudson's river in New-York, known by the name of the
<PB N="397" REF="024239_0403_0FC57CA50179DA78"/>
Alleghany and Apalachian mountains, em∣phatically stiled the Spine of North-America, terminates in this state about 60 miles from its southern boundary.</P>
<P>AS this state so nearly resembles South-Ca∣rolina in situation, soil, temperature of cli∣mate, and almost every other circumstance, I shall not trouble the reader with parti∣culars.</P>
<P>DR. Ramsay advises strangers who pro∣pose to settle in the southern states, to manage so as to arrive there about the beginning of November, that their constitutions may have time to become accommodated to the climate before the commencement of the sickly sea∣son. The same learned and judicious writer remarks, that the sudden deaths of persons unaccustomed to the climate of South-Caro∣lina, are to be referred to an injudicious choice of time in coming to it, and still more to their own imprudence and irregularities, in con∣junction with the hospitality of the inhabi∣tants.</P>

<PB N="398" REF="024239_0404_0FC57CA5F2A7AAA8"/>
<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>BY comparing the preceding account of the several climates of the United States with those of the countries in Europe in the same parallels of latitude, we learn that there is a very material difference between them.</P>
<P>THIS circumstance is presumed to be ow∣ing to the following causes.</P>
<P>1st. To the height of the lands in North-America, which are situated between the 40th and 50th degrees of latitude, and extend be∣tween six and seven hundred miles from north to south. From these the greatest ri∣vers have their source. To the east of them lie the lakes Superior, Michegan, Huron, Otswego, Erie, &amp;c. and the intermediate country is covered with impenetrable forests, interspersed with swamps and morasses;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>To M. de Mairan we owe the discovery that the rigour of the Winter's cold is tempered by the heat imparted to the atmosphere by the earth, and that this heat is always propor∣tioned to the heat absorbed by the earth in the absence of frost, and that the Winter is more or less severe according as the heat and dryness of the atmosphere has been more or less intense during the preceding Summer.</P>
<P><HI>Kirwan's Estimate of Climates.</HI></P></NOTE>
<PB N="399" REF="024239_0405_0FC57CA82C6203C8"/>
hence this vast space is incapable of receiving or retaining much heat in Summer, and con∣sequently one great source of that warmth by which the Winters in the old continent are moderated, is here considerably diminished.</P>
<P>HENCE also the westerly winds, at least such of them as originate behind these high lands, deposite their vapours in passing over them, and re-absorb fresh ones from these numerous lakes and immense forests over which they pass, and are thereby still more cooled; for air always participates of the temperature of the substance with which it comes in contact.</P>
<P>FARTHER north, viz. between latitude 52 and 63, lie Hudson's Bay and Straits; about
<PB N="400" REF="024239_0406_0FC57CA9A6A75ED8"/>
50 miles on the south of this bay, from lat. 50° to 58°, there runs a ridge of mountains, which prevents its receiving any heat from that quarter; and hence the intermediate country is so cold that scarce any animal can live in it.</P>
<P>To the east, this bay is bounded by the barren, mountainous country of Labrador, and a number of islands that lie at its en∣trance. The portion of the Atlantic opposite to the entrance of these streights is surround∣ed partly by the continent of America, and partly by Greenland as far down as lat. 59. Both are mountainous and intersected by a multitude of creeks and inlets, which are fro∣zen over in Winter, and the ensuing Sum∣mer the floating ice is protected by numerous high islands, and partly carried down the eastern coast as far as lat. 42, whereby the coolness of the atmosphere is encreased. Hence the N. W. winds are the coldest in all these parts of America during the Winter season, and for reasons which have been ex∣plained
<PB N="401" REF="024239_0407_0FC57CAE6BBF7A68"/>
from page 80 to 96 the north-east as the coldest in Summer.</P>
<P>THE greatest part of the heat of the atmos∣phere is certainly derived from its communi∣cation with the land or water over which it passes, and in this way it receives either heat or cold more readily than any other body of equal bulk, especially when confined, as in vallies.</P>
<P>AIR incumbent on seas or on large tracts of water, is generally many degrees warmer in Winter, and cooler in Summer, than air incumbent on land; because land is more susceptible both of heat and cold than water.</P>
<P>EXPERIMENTS made by Mr. Hales in 1724, prove that the surface of the earth is much heated during the Summer, but that this heat descends very slowly, a great part of it being communicated to the air.</P>
<P><PB N="402" REF="024239_0408_0FC57CAFB99B48B0"/>
THAT during the Winter the earth gives out to the air the heat it had accumulated during the Summer, and that on this circum∣stance in a great measure the temperature of the Winter depends.</P>
<P>Now as the earth must receive more or less heat during the Summer season, according to the greater or lesser freedom of access which the sun's rays have to it, and to the longer or shorter duration of their access, it follows that whatever circumstances have the effect of obstructing or preventing this access must diminish the grand source which moderates the rigour of the land winds, which prevail during the Winter season. The principal cir∣cumstances which obstruct the action of the rays of the sun upon the earth, are cloudy and wet weather, the effects of extraordinary evaporation.</P>
<P>THE evaporation from the lakes, swamps and forests in America is astonishing.</P>
<P><PB N="403" REF="024239_0409_0FC57CB2561A8608"/>
THE evaporation from land covered with living vegetables is much greater than from that which is bare. The rays of the sun are not only obstructed by the evaporations from these immense forests, but where the trees are tall and close together, they are entirely excluded from acting upon the ground at all.</P>
<P>HENCE it may be presumed that the woods, thickets, and height of the lands in North-America are the circumstances which render the climates of the several states different from, and less agreeable than the countries in the same latitude in Europe, where the lands are lower, and the country more cleared and bet∣ter cultivated.</P>
<P>WE also learn from the account of the dis∣eases contained in the preceding pages, that the cold of the northern states properly guard∣ed against, produces but few diseases of a dangerous nature, and that Intermitting, Re∣mitting or Bilious Fevers, and Fluxes, are scarcely ever known there; but in proceeding
<PB N="404" REF="024239_0410_0FC57CB36E446FC8"/>
to the southward in Maryland and Virginia, where the heat is more intense and of longer continuance, and the soil more moist, especi∣ally upon lands in an imperfect state of culti∣vation, the diseases last mentioned are very prevalent, and often fatal, especially to fo∣reigners; though the natives who fix their habitations in dry and elevated situations, and observe a medium between excess and absti∣nence, enjoy a tolerable share of health.</P>
<P>IN South-Carolina and Georgia, Fevers and Fluxes are still more epidemic, violent, and obstinate, especially after the Rice harvest in August and September, when the waters are diminished and permitted to stagnate and corrupt. The fevers which occur at this sea∣son are very anomalous, neither intermitting nor remitting perfectly, but participating much of the nature of that commonly called the Yellow Fever, which is often so fatal with∣in the Tropics.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH the United States of America
<PB N="405" REF="024239_0411_0FC57CB511C898D8"/>
cannot boast of the superiority of their cli∣mates over other countries in parallel lati∣tudes, they are exceeded by few in fertility of soil, and equalled by none in political advan∣tages.</P>
<P>AND, from whatever causes it may proceed, the inhabitants, in the middle and particularly in the northern states enjoy a greater proportion of health, and live to a greater age than the in∣habitants of Europe. The diseases which do occur are more simple and uniform; and this country is intirely exempt from some of the most formidable and destructive which infest the other quarters of the globe.</P>
<P>THE Spotted Pestilence, the fatal offspring of famine, uncleanliness, and vitiated air, has never yet reached our favoured shores.</P>
<P>THE Small-pox, the Measles, the Malig∣nant Quinsy, the Influenza, and almost every other contagious disease were foreigners to this continent, till they were introduced
<PB N="406" REF="024239_0412_0FC57CBA468382D0"/>
through the medium of commerce from Eu∣rope, into which they were first conveyed from Asia, or the dominions of the despotic Turk, bordering on that immense continent.</P>
<P>THE Leprosy, the Yaws, the Eliphantiasis, and other loathsome disorders are endemic to Africa.</P>
<P>WHETHER Africa or South-America gave origin to the Syphilis remains uncertain, though that dishonour is generally ascribed to the latter.</P>
<P>NOR is North-America, like many other countries, subject to earthquakes, the erup∣tion of volcanoes, hurricanes, periodical de∣luges, impetuous whirlwinds, noxious and consuming blasts of wind, or withering and protracted drought.</P>
<P>WHAT does it avail the inhabitants of A∣sia that many of their provinces are blest with the most delightful climate and fertile soil
<PB N="407" REF="024239_0413_0FC57CBBA8AFAE10"/>
that imagination can conceive, since they themselves are in subjection to the arbitrary will of a capricious and despotic tyrant.</P>
<P>ONE half of Africa lies beneath the burn∣ing line, and its sable inhabitants are all im∣mersed in rude and dismal barbarism, entirely unacquainted with the use of the Plough and the Loom.</P>
<P>EVEN in Europe (the seat of Science and the nurse of Arts) Liberty, "the most preci∣ous gift of heaven to man," is scarcely known, or only enjoyed by the lucky and the favoured few. The rest are greater drudges than the beasts they own; for there, society is divided into two distinct classes, nobles and commons, lords and tenants: the former possessing and enjoying every thing; the latter indigent, op∣pressed, and almost destitute of the common necessaries of life.</P>
<P>NORTH-AMERICA is the only portion of this spacious globe where man can
<PB N="408" REF="024239_0414_0FC57CBE5D5AA600"/>
live securely, and enjoy all the privileges to which he has a native right.</P>
<P>IN this enviable and favoured region there is no proud—usurping aristocracy—no ec∣clesiastical orders with exclusive privileges—no kings with arbitrary power or corrupting influence—no venal parliaments composed of different ranks and opposing interests—no monopolizing confederacies of opulent and interested traders and manufacturers, to the exclusion of those to whom chance or fortune has been less liberal.</P>
<P>NOR are the taxes or expences of govern∣ment so considerable as to consume the pro∣fits of honest industry, or ever employed to gratify the splendid projects of mad ambi∣tion.</P>
<P>IT is true none of the enervating re∣finements of luxury or dissipation are to be found here; but here all the necessaries and conveniences of life abound, and a pleasing
<PB N="409" REF="024239_0415_0FC57CBFACFB59B0"/>
equality and decent competence are every where displayed—here the dignity of the human species is restored, and man enjoys all the freedom to which he is entitled; for here he is a member of the government he obeys, and a framer of the laws by which he is governed, either in person or by the repre∣sentatives of his own choice.</P>
