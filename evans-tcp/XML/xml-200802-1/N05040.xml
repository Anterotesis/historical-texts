<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>IT has long been regretted as a Misfortune to the Youth of this Province, that we have no <HI>ACADEMY,</HI> in which they might receive the Ac∣complishments of a regular Education.</P>
<P>The following Paper of <HI>Hints</HI> towards form∣ing a Plan for that Purpose, is so far approv'd by some publick-spirited Gentlemen, to whom it has been privately communicated, that they have directed a Number of Copies to be made by the Press, and properly distributed, in order to ob∣tain the Sentiments and Advice of Men of Learning, Understanding, and Experience in these Matters; and have determin'd to use their Inte∣rest and best Endeavours, to have the Scheme, when compleated, carried gradually into Execu∣tion; in which they have Reason to believe they shall have the hearty Concurrence and Assistance of many who are Wellwishers to their Country.</P>
<P>Those who incline to favour the Design with their Advice, either as to the Parts of Learning to be taught, the Order of Study, the Meth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of Teaching, the Oeconomy of the School, or any o∣ther Matter of Importance to the Success of the Undertaking, are desired to communicate their Sentiments as soon as may be, by Letter directed to <HI>B. Franklin,</HI> Printer, in <HI>Philadelphia.</HI></P>

<P>THE good Education of Youth has been esteemed by wise Men in all A∣ges, as the surest Foundation of the Happiness both of private Families and of Common-wealths. Almost all Govern∣ments have therefore made it a principal Ob∣ject of their Attention, to establish and endow with proper Revenues, such Seminaries of Learning, as might supply the succeeding Age with Men qualified to serve the Publick with Honour to themselves, and to their Country.<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>As some Things here propos'd may be found to differ a little from the Forms of Education in common Use, the following Quotations are to shew the Opinions of several learned Men, who have carefully considered and wrote expresly on the Sub∣ject; such as <HI>Milton, Locke, Rollin, Turnbull,</HI> and others. They generally complain, that the <HI>old Method</HI> is in many Re∣spects wrong; but long settled Forms are not easily changed. For us, who are now to make a Beginning, 'tis, at least, as ea∣sy to set out right as wrong; and therefore their Sentiments are on this Occasion well worth our Consideration.</P><P>Mr. <HI>Rollin</HI> says <HI>(Belles Lett. p.</HI> 249. speaking of the Manner of Educating Youth) "Though it be generally a very wise and judicious Rule to avoid all Singularity, and to follow the re∣ceived Customs, yet I question whether, in the Point we now treat of, this Principle does not admit of some Exception, and whether we ought not to apprehend the Dangers and Inconveni∣encies of blindly following the Footsteps of those who have gone before us, so as to consult <HI>Custom</HI> more than <HI>Reason,</HI> and the go∣verning our Actions rather by what others <HI>do,</HI> than by what they <HI>should do</HI>; from whence it often happens, that an Error once established is handed down from Age to Age, and becomes almost a certain Law, from a Notion, that we ought to act like the rest of Mankind, and follow the Example of the greatest Number. But human Nature is not so happy as to have the greatest Number always make the best Choice, and we too frequently observe the contrary."</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="006321_0005_1028A063D46B9D88"/>Many of the first Settlers of these Provinces, were Men who had received a good Education in <HI>Europe,</HI> and to their Wisdom and good Ma∣nagement we owe much of our present Prospe∣rity. But their Hands were full, and they could not do all Things. The present Race are not thought to be generally of equal Abili∣ty: For though the <HI>American</HI> Youth are al∣low'd not to want Capacity; yet the best Ca∣pacities require Cultivation, it being truly with them, as with the best Ground, which unless well tilled and sowed with profitable Seed, produces only ranker Weeds.</P>
<P>That we may obtain the Advantages arising from an Increase of Knowledge, and prevent as much as may be the mischievous Consequen∣ces that would attend a general Ignorance a∣mong us, the following <HI>Hints</HI> are offered to∣wards forming a Plan for the Education of the Youth of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> viz.</P>
<P>It is propos'd,</P>
<P>THAT some Persons of Leisure and publick Spirit, apply for a CHARTER, by which they may be incorporated, with Power to erect an ACADEMY for the Educati∣on

on of Youth, to govern the same, provide Ma∣sters, make Rules, receive Donations, purchase Lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to add to their Number, from Time to Time such other Persons as they shall judge suitable.</P>
<P>That the Members of the Corporation make it their Pleasure, and in some Degree their Bu∣siness, to visit the Academy often, encourage and <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rollin,</HI> Vol. 2. p. 371. mentions a <HI>French</HI> Gentleman, Mons. <HI>Hersan,</HI> who, "at his own Expence, built a School for the Use of poor Children, one of the finest in the Kingdom; and left a Stipend for the Master. That he himself taught them very often, and generally had some of them at his Table. He clothed several of them; and distributed Rewards among them from Time to Time, in order to encourage then to study."</NOTE> countenance the Youth, countenance and assist the Masters, and by all Means in their Power advance the Usefulness and Reputation of the Design; that they look on the Students as in some Sort their Children, treat them with Familiarity and Affection, and when they have behav'd well, and gone through their Studies, and are to enter the World, zealously unite, and make all the Interest that can be made to esta∣blish them <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Something seems wanting in <HI>America</HI> to incite and stimu∣late Youth to Study. In <HI>Europe</HI> the Encouragements to Learn∣ing are of themselves much greater than can be given here. Whoever distinguishes himself there, in either of the three learned Professions, gains Fame, and often Wealth and Power: A poor Man's Son has a Chance, if he studies hard, to rise, ei∣ther in the Law or the Church, to gainful Offices or Benefices; to an extraordinary Pitch of Grandeur; to have a Voice in Par∣liament, a Seat among the Peers; as a Statesman or first Mini∣ster to govern Nations, and even to mix his Blood with Princes.</NOTE>, whether in Business, Offices, Marriages, or any other Thing for their Ad∣vantage,

preferably to all other Persons what∣soever even of equal Merit.</P>
<P>And if Men may, and frequently do, catch such a Taste for cultivating Flowers, for Plant∣ing, Grafting, Inoculating, and the like, as to despise all other Amusements for their Sake, why may not we expect they should acquire a Relish for that <HI>more useful</HI> Culture of young Minds. <HI>Thompson</HI> says,
<Q><L>'Tis Joy to see the human Blossoms blow,</L>
<L>When infant Reason grows apace, and calls</L>
<L>For the kind Hand of an assiduous Care;</L>
<L>Delightful Task! to rear the tender Thought,</L>
<L>To teach the young Idea how to shoot,</L>
<L>To pour the fresh Instruction o'er the Mind,</L>
<L>To breathe th' enliv'ning Spirit, and to fix</L>
<L>The generous Purpose in the glowing Breast.</L></Q></P>

Both Mind and Body would thus become gradually too relaxed, too much unbraced for the Fatigues and Duties of active Life. Such is the Union between Soul and Body, that the same Exercises which are conducive, when rightly managed, to consolidate or strengthen the former, are likewise equally necessary and fit to produce Courage, Firmness, and manly Vigour, in the latter.

A Man may often express his Ideas, even to his own Countrymen, more clearly with a Lead Pencil, or Bit of Chalk, than with his Tongue. And many can understand a Figure, that do not comprehend a Description in Words, tho' ever so properly chosen. All Boys have an early Inclination to this Improvement, and begin to make Figures of Animals, Ships, Machines, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as soon as they can use a Pen: But for want of a little Instruction at that Time, generally are discoura∣ged, and quit the Pursuit.</P><P>Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> says, p. 234. "When your Son can write well and quick, I think it may be convenient not only to continue the Exercise of his Hand in Writing, but also to improve the Use of it further in <HI>Drawing</HI>; a Thing very useful to a Gen∣tleman on several Occasions; but especially if he travel; as that which helps a Man often to express in a <HI>few Lines</HI> well put to∣gether, what a <HI>whole Sheet of Paper in Writing</HI> would not be able to represent and make intelligible. How many Buildings may a Man see, how many <HI>Machines</HI> and Habits meet with, the Ideas whereof would be easily retain'd, and communicated by a little Skill in Drawing; which being committed to Words, are in Danger to be lost, or at best but ill retained in the most exact Descriptions? I do not mean that I would have him a perfect Painter; to be that to any tolerable Degree, will re∣quire more Time than he can spare from his other Improve∣ments of greater Moment.

'Tis seldom observ'd that he who keeps an Account of his Income and Expences, and thereby has constantly un∣der View the Course of his Domestic Affairs, lets them run to Ruin: And I doubt not but many a Man gets behind-hand before he is aware, or runs farther on when he is once in, for want of this Care, or the Skill to do it.

<P><PB N="13" REF="006321_0012_1028A0911206BF00"/>The <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI> speaking of <HI>Grammar,</HI> p. 252. says, "That to those the greatest Part of whose Business in this World is to be done with their Tongues, and with their Pens, it is conveni∣ent, if not necessary, that they should speak properly and cor∣rectly, whereby they may let their Thoughts into other Mens Minds the more easily, and with the greater Impression. Up∣on this Account it is, that any sort of Speaking, so as will make him be understood, is not thought enough for a Gentle∣man. He ought to study <HI>Grammar,</HI> among the other Helps of Speaking well, but it <HI>must be</HI> THE GRAMMAR OF HIS OWN TONGUE, of the Language he uses, that he may understand his own Country Speech nicely, and speak it properly, without shocking the Ears of those it is addressed to with Solecisms and offensive Irregularities. And to this Purpose <HI>Grammar is neces∣sary</HI>; but it is the Grammar <HI>only</HI> of <HI>their own proper Tongues,</HI> and to those who would take Pains in cultivating their Lan∣guage, and perfecting their Stiles. Whether all Gentlemen should not do this, I leave to be considered, since the Want of Propriety and Grammatical Exactness is thought very misbe∣coming one of that Rank, and usually draws on one guilty of such Faults, the Imputation of having had a lower Breeding and worse Company than suits with his Quality. If this be so (as I suppose it is) it will be Matter of Wonder, why young Gentlemen are forc'd to learn the Grammars of foreign and dead Languages, and are never once told of the Grammar of their own Tongues. They do not so much as know there is any such Thing, much less is it made their Business to be in∣structed in it. Nor is their own Language ever propos'd to them as worthy their Care and Cultivating, tho' they have <HI>dai∣ly Use</HI> of it, and are not seldom, in the future Course of their Lives, judg'd of by their handsome or awkward Way of ex∣pressing themselves in it. Whereas the Languages whose Gram∣mars they have been so much employed in, are such as proba∣bly they shall scarce ever speak or write; or if upon Occasion this should happen, they should be excused for the Mistakes and Faults they make in it. Would not a <HI>Chinese,</HI> who took No∣tice of this Way of Breeding, be apt to imagine, that all our young Gentlemen were designed to be Teachers and Professors of the dead Languages of foreign Countries, and not to be Men of Business in their own." Page 255. the same Author adds, That if Grammar ought to be taught at any Time, it must be to one that can speak the Language already; how else can he be taught the Grammar of it? This at least is evident from the Practice of the wise and learned Nations among the Antients. They made it a <HI>Part of Education</HI> to cultivate <HI>their own,</HI> not foreign Tongues. The <HI>Greeks</HI> counted all other Nations barba∣rous, and had a Contempt for their Languages. And though the <HI>Greek</HI> Learning grew in Credit amongst the <HI>Romans</HI> towards the End of their Commonwealth, yet it was the <HI>Roman</HI> Tongue that was made the Study of their Youth: <HI>Their own</HI> Language they were to make Use of, and therefore it was <HI>their own</HI> Lan∣guage they were <HI>instructed</HI> and <HI>exercised</HI> in." And p. 281. "There can scarce be a greater Defect (says he) in a Gentle∣man, than not to express himself well either in Writing or Speaking. But yet I think I may ask the Reader, whether he doth not know a great many, who live upon their Estates, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, with the Name, should have the Qualities of Gentlemen, who cannot so much as tell a Story as they should, much less speak clearly and persuasively in any Business.

He spends great Part of his first Vol. of <HI>Belles Lettres,</HI> on that Subject; and lays down some excellent Rules or Methods of Teaching <HI>French</HI> to <HI>Frenchmen</HI> grammatically, and making them Masters therein, which are very applicable to our Language, but too long to be inserted here.

"The <HI>Greeks,</HI> perhaps, made more early Ad∣vances in the most useful Sciences than any Youth have done since, chiefly on this Account, that they studied no other Lan∣guage but their own.

For to articu∣late the Words and join them together, I do not call <HI>Reading,</HI> unless one can pronounce well, observe all the proper Stops, vary the Voice, express the Sentiments, and read with a deli∣cate Intelligence. Nor can he speak a Jot better. A Proof of this is, that he cannot write ten Lines without committing gross Faults; and because he did not learn his own Language well in his early Years, he will never know it well. I except a few, who being afterwards engaged by their Profession, or their na∣tural Taste, cultivate their Minds by Study. And yet even they, if they attempt to write, will find by the <HI>Labour</HI> Compo∣sition costs them, what a <HI>Loss it is,</HI> not to have learned their Language in the proper Season. Education among the <HI>Romans</HI> was upon a quite different Footing. Masters of Rhetoric taught them early the Principles, the Difficulties, the Beauties, the Subtleties, the Depths, the Riches of their own Language. When they went from these Schools, they were perfect Masters of it, they were never at a Loss for proper Expressions; and I am much deceived if it was not owing to this, that they produ∣ced such excellent Works with so <HI>marvellous F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tility.</HI>"</P><P><HI>Pliny,</HI> in his Letter to a Lady on chusing a Tutor for her Son, speaks of it as the most material Thing in his Education, that he should have a good <HI>Latin</HI> Master of Rhetoric, and recom∣mends <HI>Julius Genitor</HI> for his <HI>eloquent, open and plain Faculty of Speaking.</HI> He does not advise her to a <HI>Greek</HI> Master of Rheto∣ric, tho' the <HI>Greeks</HI> were famous for that Science; but to a <HI>La∣tin</HI> Master, because <HI>Latin</HI> was the Boy's Mother Tongue.

He adds,</P><P>"Had the Methods of Education been directed to their right End, one would have thought this so necessary a Part could not have been neglected, whilst Themes and Verses in <HI>Latin,</HI> of no Use at all, were so constantly every where pressed, to the Racking of Childrens Inventions beyond their Strength, and hindring their chearful Progress by unnatural Difficulties.

This I find universally neglected, nor no Care taken any where to improve young Men in their own Language, that they may thoroughly understand and be Masters of it. If any one among us have a Facility or Purity more than ordinary in his Mother Tongue, it is owing to Chance, or his Genius, or any Thing, rather than to his Education, or any Care of his Teacher.

Courage, says an excellent Writer, in an ill-bred Man has the Air, and escapes not the Opinion of Brutality; Learning becomes Pedantry; Wit, Buffoonery; Plainness, Rusticity; and there cannot be a good Quality in him which Ill-breeding will not warp and disfigure to his Disadvantage." <HI>Turnbull,</HI> p. 327.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="006321_0029_1028A0844F5AE0B0"/>The Idea of what is <HI>true Merit,</HI> should al∣so be often presented to Youth, explain'd and impress'd on their Minds, as consisting in an <HI>Inclination</HI> join'd with an <HI>Ability</HI> to serve Man∣kind, one's Country, Friends and Family; which <HI>Ability</HI> is (with the Blessing of God) to be acquir'd or greatly encreas'd by <HI>true Learn∣ing</HI>; and should indeed be the great <HI>Aim</HI> and <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>To have in View the <HI>Glory</HI> and <HI>Service of God,</HI> as some express themselves, is only the same Thing in other Words. For <HI>Doing Good to Men</HI> is the <HI>only Service of God</HI> in our Power; and to <HI>imitate his Beneficence</HI> is to <HI>glorify him.</HI> Hence <HI>Milton</HI> says, "The <HI>End</HI> of Learning is to repair the Ruins of our first Pa∣rents, by regaining to <HI>know God aright,</HI> and out of that Know∣ledge to <HI>love him,</HI> to <HI>imitate</HI> him, to be <HI>like him,</HI> as we may the nearest by possessing our Souls of true Virtue." <HI>Educ. p.</HI> 373. Mr. <HI>Hutcheson</HI> says, <HI>Dial.</HI> v. 2. <HI>p.</HI> 97. "The <HI>principal End</HI> of Edu∣cation is, to <HI>form us wise and good Creatures, useful to others, and happy ourselves.</HI> The whole Art of Education lies within a narrow Compass, and is reducible to a very simple Practice; namely, <HI>To assist in unfolding those Natural and Moral Powers with which Man is endowed, by presenting proper Objects and Occasions; to watch their Growth that they be not diverted from their End, or disturbed in their Operation by any foreign Violence; and gently to conduct and apply them to all the Purposes of private and of public Life."</HI> And Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> (p. 84. Educ.) says, "'Tis VIRTUE, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, direct VIRTUE, which is to be <HI>aim'd at</HI> in Education. All other Considerations and Accomplishments are nothing in Comparison to this. This is the <HI>solid</HI> and <HI>sub∣stantial</HI> Good, which Tutors should not only read Lectures and talk of, but the <HI>Labour</HI> and <HI>Art of Education</HI> should furnish the Mind with, and <HI>fasten</HI> there, and never cease till the young Man had a true Relish of it, and plac'd his <HI>Strength,</HI> his <HI>Glory,</HI> and his <HI>Pleasure,</HI> in it." And Mons. <HI>Rollin, Belles Lettres,</HI> Vol. 4. p. 249. to the same Purpose, "If we consult our Reason e∣ver so little, it is easy to discern that the END which Masters should have in View, is not barely to teach their Scholars <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> to learn them to make Exercises and Verses, to charge their Memory with Facts and historical Dates, to draw up Syllogisms in Form, or to trace Lines and Figures upon Pa∣per. These Branches of Learning I own are useful and valua∣ble, but as <HI>Means,</HI> and not as the <HI>End</HI>; when they conduct us to other Things, and not when we stop at them; when they serve us as Preparatives and Instruments for better Knowledge, with∣out which the rest would be useless. Youth would have Cause to complain, if they were condemned to spend eight or ten of the best Years of their Life in learning, at a great Expence, and with incredible Pains, one or two Languages, and some other Matters of a like Nature, which perhaps they would seldom have Occasion to use. The End of Masters, in the long Course of their Studies, is to habituate their Scholars to serious Appli∣cation of Mind, to make them love and value the Sciences, and to cultivate in them such a Taste, as shall make them thirst after them when they are gone from School; to point out the Me∣thod of attaining them; and make them thoroughly sensible of their Use and Value; and by that Means dispose them for the different Employments to which it shall please God to call them. Besides this, the <HI>End</HI> of Masters should be, <HI>to improve their Hearts</HI> and Understandings, to protect their Innocence, to <HI>in∣spire</HI> them with Principles of <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Probity,</HI> to train them up to good Habits; to correct and subdue in them by gentle Means, the ill Inclinations they shall be observed to have, such as Pride, Insolence, an high Opinion of themselves, and a saucy Vanity continually employed in lessening others; a blind Self-love solely attentive to its own Advantage; a Spirit of Raillery which is pleased with offending and insulting others; an Indo∣lence and Sloth, which renders all the good Qualities of the Mind useless."</P><P>Dr. <HI>Turnbull</HI> has the same Sentiments, with which we shall conclude this Note. If, says he, there be any such Thing as DUTY, or any such Thing as HAPPINESS; if there be any Difference between right and wrong Conduct; any Distinction between Virtue and Vice, or Wisdom and Folly; in fine, if there be any such Thing as Perfection or Imperfection belong∣ing to the rational Powers which constitute moral Agents; or if Enjoyments and Pursuits admit of Comparison; <HI>Good Educa∣tion</HI> must of Necessity be acknowledged to mean, <HI>proper Care</HI> to instruct early in the Science of Happiness and Duty, or in the Art of Judging and <HI>Acting aright</HI> in Life. Whatever else one may have learned, if he comes into the World from his School∣ing and Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ters, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>cquainted with the Nature, Rank and Condition, of Mankind, and the <HI>Duties of human Life</HI> (in its more ordinary Circumstances at least) he hath lost his Time; <HI>he is not educated</HI>; he is not prepared for the World; he is not qualified for Society; he is not fitted for discharging the <HI>pro∣per Business of Man.</HI> The Way therefore to judge whether E∣ducation be on a right Footing or not, is to compare it with the END; or to consider what it does in order to accomplish Youth for choosing and <HI>behaving well</HI> in the various Conditions, <HI>Re∣lations</HI> and Incidents, of Life. If Education be calculated and adapted to furnish young Minds betimes with proper Know∣ledge for their Guidance and Direction in the chief Affairs of the World, and in the principal Vicissitudes to which human Concerns are subject, then is it indeed <HI>proper or right Education.</HI> But if <HI>such Instruction</HI> be not the <HI>principal Scope</HI> to which all o∣ther Lessons are rendered subservient in what is called the <HI>Insti∣tution of Youth,</HI> either <HI>the Art of Living and Acting well</HI> is not Man's <HI>most important</HI> Business, or what ought to be the CHIEF END of Education is neglected, and sacrificed to something of <HI>far inferior</HI> Moment. <HI>Observations on Liberal Education, p.</HI> 175, 176.</P></NOTE> <HI>End</HI> of all Learning.</P>
