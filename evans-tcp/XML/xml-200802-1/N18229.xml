<HEAD>AN ADDRESS, DELIVERED AT THE OPENING OF PORTSMOUTH ACADEMY.</HEAD>
<P>THE BENEVOLENT mind must experience great pleasure in beholding means taking, and new institutions forming in various places, to educate our youth, and particularly that valuable part of our species, our young FEMALES. This subject has engaged the attention of some of our most beloved citizens in these states. They have justly consi∣dered it, as a very important source of national prosperity. They wish so to conduct it, as will best accommodate it, to the state of society, man∣ners and government in our country.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="023649_0003_0FC08D1F4793AE98"/>THE Principal of the Academy, now opened a∣mong us, has called our attention, my friends and fellow citizens, to a design which it is in our power to make profitable to him, as well as beneficial to our children. The healthiness of our climate— the elegant manners of the people of this town, give us all necessary advantages: It is by our uni∣ted aid that it may flourish, even if no assistance is derived from others.</P>
<P>WHEN we reflect, that early education tinctures or forms our character in a great degree, for life; we are irresistibly drawn to exert our utmost ability to afford our youth every possible advantage to gain the best. That small sum which industry and eco∣nomy will give almost every parent, is far better bestowed, than a large patrimony joined with ig∣norance. A knowledge of business every day pre∣sents men with offices whose rewards are equal to the rent of large estates, and the annual interest of great sums—where these persons have not inherited a shil∣ling, and possess no other riches than a good edu∣cation.</P>
<P>BY instructing our <HI>females</HI> in those useful and ne∣cessary branches of industry which are peculiar to
<PB N="5" REF="023649_0004_0FC08D2162170918"/>
their sex, we also furnish them with a source of wealth and profit, which is necessary for all conditions in life; which may be laid aside when affluence per∣mits, or assumed when adversity with its billows rolls trouble and indigence upon them.</P>
<P>THE mode in descent of lands—the very equal distribution of property—and the equality of rank in our country also demand, that every class of our citizens educate their children in the best manner possible. The great Creator of us all, has made no difference in the endowments of the head or heart, between the child of the monarch or of the peasant. Very rarely does the property of a frugal ancestor descend to the third generation. These ideas daily convince us, that a good education, principles of virtue, and useful acquirements, are to be sought as the most essential benefits for our children.</P>
<P>THIS theme has been discussed so often, that I cannot insure to you, that I shall say any thing new upon this occasion. The most I can promise is to refresh your memories, and keep alive the subject. As a Christian Minister, I can come to you with no better arguments and examples, than those pre∣sented in the volume of our holy religion. The
<PB N="6" REF="023649_0005_0FC08D226472C7B0"/>
Bible affords the most excellent patterns, by which to form the great and useful character of men and women. In the 31st chapter of Proverbs, we find a model for the female character, by which to make the daughter of every American citizen, that virtu∣ous woman whose price is far above rubies. Solo∣mon closes this rich treasury of instruction, with a chapter which records the lesson of a mother to her son, even the words of King Lemuel—the lesson which his mother taught him. He was now per∣haps in the improving season of youth, or just ad∣vanced to the throne, and seeking a Queen. After some general instructions upon temperance and chastity, upon comforting and defending the afflict∣ed, she proceeds with portraying the character of a good wife The mother of a King is employed in an office highly becoming her rank. She is presented by the wise King Solomon, as a pattern to mothers in general. It is their peculiar task to direct the morals of youth. Their care in infancy, constant attention and society during the critical period of youth—the many opportunities which do∣mestic life affords, enable them alone, to do the duty properly. Business and many cares call the father abroad, but home is the mother's province; here she reigns sole mistress, the greatest part of her
<PB N="7" REF="023649_0006_0FC08D2BA84D2768"/>
life. If her children err, she must bear a large share in their guilt and sufferings This chapter is more valuable when we consider, that in a good wife are united the characters of a daughter, mother, friend and mistress; most of the dearest relations in life are concentred in her. Is she such a person as fills all these stations properly? Behold her rewarding the cares, and cheering the souls of her affection∣ate parents, obedient children, tender husband, firm friends and faithful servants. These live, as by her smiles. Is she useful in her station? Does she excell? A long train of the good and virtuous attend her wishes, applaud her conduct, and exalt her praise. Domestic happiness dwells where she resides; society is adorned and made pleasant by her actions; religion is recommended by her bright example. She appears like one of those guardian angels, who are supposed to attend around the good in this world, as ministring servants, to guide, guard and animate them through life, and convoy them after death to Heaven.</P>
<P>WHILE fine writers, poets and painters, gene∣rally select good women to represent angels; they also take the bad, to portray the horrid picture of furies. While we greedily gaze at the one, we
<PB N="8" REF="023649_0007_0FC08D2CAF6B1D48"/>
turn with abhorrence from the other. So odious is the sight of the bad, that even vicious men, shun their company and avoid their acquaintance, in the presence of the opposite lovely character, whom the poet describes in the mother of our race —"grace was in all her steps—Heaven in her eye —in every gesture, dignity and love."</P>
<P>"THE price of a virtuous woman is far above rubies"—is more valuable than the richest and most costly gems. This description of her worth is enhanced, when we read Job's representation of wisdom, that excellent gift of God;—"that it ex∣ceeds the gold of ophir—cannot be valued with the onyx or the sapphire—that it shall not be ex∣changed for vessels of fine gold—that no mention shall be made of coral or of pearls, when in balance with wisdom, for her value is above rubies." The same language is used in the oracles of Omniscience to recommend wisdom, or true religion, as is em∣ployed to represent unto us, that precious gift, that favour from the Lord, a good wife.</P>
<P>"THE heart of her husband doth safely trust in her,"—in her prudence and knowledge. He is therefore in no fear of waste or spoil by her idleness,
<PB N="9" REF="023649_0008_0FC08D2E218EDDB8"/>
extravagance or prodigality.—So far from this, she shall help him in increasing his wealth.—"She shall do him good, and not evil all the days of her life."</P>
<P>HER industrious disposition and habits lead "her to seek wool and flax, and she worketh will∣ingly with her hands." By this, she is furnished with means to open a merchandize, which gives her the productions of distant regions. "Like the merchant ships, she bringeth her food from far▪" Here a wide field opens for the display of her abi∣lities and ingenuity.</P>
<P>TO prevent excessive sorrow, and needless repi∣nings, her attendants live by her bounty. She spares not in the prosecution of her duty toward her dependants, in order to make them faithful and happy, to "rise while it is yet night, that she may give meat to her houshold, and a portion to her maidens. She does not totally confine her cares to merchandize, but knowing the value of real pro∣perty—the quality of lands, and importance of agriculture, she considereth a field and buyeth it. With the earnings of her hand, and fruit selected
<PB N="10" REF="023649_0009_0FC08D41111DBAA8"/>
by herself, she planteth a vineyard with the best twigs, and most delicious grapes.</P>
<P>SO FAR is this from being too masculine or im∣proper for her delicate sex, it gives her health and she girdeth her loins with strength, and strengthen∣eth her hands by use. Her cares and exertions pre∣sent her with the pleasing sight of beholding that her merchandize is good. She tastes, sees and knows that it is safe and honourable.</P>
<P>DROWSINESS and sluggishness are strangers to her. To be always equipped for industry, her candle go∣eth not out by night. She improves all opportu∣nities of honestly increasing her wealth. Without confiding in the uncertainties that often attend mercantile employments—without hazarding too far the blasts and droughts that may injure her crops, or trusting to the mere accidental fallings of property into her lap, she layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.</P>
<P>THESE resources of commerce, agriculture and manufactures (as is natural) make her rich. She is furnished thereby with means to do good. She has every necessary food, cloathing and medicine
<PB N="11" REF="023649_0010_0FC08D4267ACE7F8"/>
in store for the distressed. She cheerfully stretcheth out her liberal hand to the poor, and reacheth out her hands to relieve the needy. Her knowledge of business, and the value of property, awakes a just charity to the distressed, and heightens her enjoy∣ments, when she reflects that she has done good.</P>
<P>Do storms arise?—Does the wind blow?—Or is the cold intense—the earth covered and air chilled by snow?—She dreads no sudden, unprepared for anxieties, lest the health of her houshold should be in danger: She has been provident in season— her houshold are already cloathed for all weathers; with dress that is warm, decent and valuable—even with scarlet.</P>
<P>HER domestics being thus equipped for neatness, and health—want and distress having fled from her abode—she appears with all her beauties heigh∣tened, and her works praising her in her attire. With her own hands she maketh herself coverings of the richest tapestry. Her clothing is silk and purple. No ruined merchant, mechanic or hus∣band are in her train. She has industriously provi∣ded for every elegance, without injuring any one.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="023649_0011_0FC08D44064A5230"/>THIS richness and elegance appears also in the dress—in the valuable embroideries, and various ornaments, which her needle prepares for her hus∣band. He is distinguished by the richest garb, and most serene countenance among the rulers of the land. No brow of care and domestic discon∣tent attend him to the court or levee. Wisdom, worth and virtue are the important traits, in the character of the man whose joys she improves.</P>
<P>SHE maketh fine linen and selleth it, and deliver∣eth girdles to the merchants. Strength and honour, modesty and equanimity are her clothing. Meek∣ness and quietness are graces which she cultivates, and considers as of infinitely greater excellence, far more ornamental, than all the appendages of her wardrobe or toilet. Well may she rejoice in time to come. Her wealth affords all the pleasures which riches can possibly yield. Her age feels no pinchings from want—knows no sigh for bread.</P>
<P>BUT, her cares are not confined to the property, or pelf of this world—to her own dress—to the ele∣gance of her house—the splendor of her husband—the chearfulness of her servants—the flourishing of her traffic—the fertility of her farms, gardens and vine∣yards;
<PB N="13" REF="023649_0012_0FC08D51CAEC7A70"/>
but, she has also furnished her mind with knowledge; with that true wisdom, which works of <HI>piety</HI> and <HI>morality</HI> afford. She never opens her mouth to utter <HI>folly.</HI> No <HI>scandal</HI>—no rude, angry, <HI>cruel language</HI> defile her chaste lips. With her tongue dwells the law of kindness—the most mild and gentle language. She gives an example and affords the precept, in every just and tender senti∣ment. She consoles the <HI>sick</HI> and <HI>dying</HI>—she admi∣nisters a balm to chear the <HI>afflicted.</HI> She looks well to the ways of her houshold, that they con∣duct virtuously, both in her presence and absence. She eateth not the bread of idleness; gained by ex∣tortion, or wrong doing: she is not idly sauntring abroad or night walking, while her servants are ri∣oting at home.</P>
<P>HERE is a <HI>truly noble personage,</HI> elevated by her <HI>merit</HI>; she, holds a rank, that no one can deprive her of,—which always procures respect, without the trouble of demanding it ourselves. Such a woman is more useful to the world—gains more honour to her sex—more ennobles human nature, than many of those, who have worn crowns and cor∣onets: who have been saluted with the most flatter∣ing titles—have been attended with all the parade
<PB N="14" REF="023649_0013_0FC08D5403EE68A0"/>
of royalty, while they have ruined the minds and morals of thousands.</P>
<P>THE description of this virtuous woman closes with observing, "That her children rise up and call her blessed—her husband also and he praiseth her." Doing her duty to them—making their honour, advancement and felicity, the first motive of action—knowing that they are all embarked in the same interest to make each other happy; all other principles give place to this sentiment. A∣musement and dissipation having never been sought by either as a resource to banish discontent; or made a momentary substitute, for want of felicity at home. Her partner and children pay her all possible respect and reverence.—They extol her virtues—pass the smile of joy, and echo of grateful praise, from each to the other. The children rear∣ed by her care, become blessings to the world and imitators of her perfections.—They are beheld with veneration and inherit her excellencies. A succession of worth, more valuable than titles or law can give, descends to her heirs. Her excellent ex∣ample is beheld by others, upon which, to form the useful and beloved woman, wife, daughter, mother and mistress. In the ruins of age, she is ve∣nerated,
<PB N="15" REF="023649_0014_0FC08D59D0E33630"/>
—is pleasing e'en in death.—She lives in the memory of many generations.</P>
<P>THO' many daughters have done virtuously in many things, yet such an one excels them all— possesses most of the real excellencies of the female character, and must be nearest perfection.</P>
<P>TO ALL this we may add, that, tho' one could be found in whom were united all those things which form the perfect beauty, in the opinion of the pain∣ter, statuary or man of fancy; yet that elegance of form, and motion is often deceitful—beauty is a fading flower, soon gone, never to be regained by art, nor purchased with money, and at best is vain; yet a woman who feareth the Lord, and follows his laws, shall be praised.</P>
<P>WELL may she demand our obedience to the last verse in this book and chapter; that we give her of the fruits of her hands—encourage and assist her in doing good—to improve her wealth, and gain the applause she so justly merits.</P>
<P>WHILE Job, Lot, Sampson, and others, in an∣cient times, had wives who afflicted and disgraced
<PB N="16" REF="023649_0015_0FC08D5B2B2C7D80"/>
them; Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and others, were blessed with those who comforted and did them ho∣nour. We read the story of a pious Hannah—a prudent Abigail, and a patriotic Esther. These are examples of great benefit to christians in all a∣ges. Much care was taken in early times, to select such for wives, who had been properly trained to religion and virtuous industry. Rebecca was ad∣dressed by the Ambassador, who came with a trea∣ty of marriage from his master for Isaac; and he was prepossessed in her favour, while she hospitably and humanely afforded drink at the well for his re∣tinue. Rachel was first met and loved by Jacob while she followed the employment of a shepherd's daughter.</P>
<P>WHILE man is called the lord of the creation, and has dominion given him over all things, wo∣man taken from his side, bears his image, and is placed as his companion. Their mutual union is descriptive of the union between Christ and his church.</P>
<P>IT is our duty in the American States, to pay particular attention to the education of females; that they may preserve their proper station; their
<PB N="17" REF="023649_0016_0FC08D5CCEC48C50"/>
rights and happiness, and be guided in the road to obtain those inestimable qualities, piety to God— reverence to parents—love and obedience to their husbands—tenderness and watchfulness over their children—justice and humanity to their dependants.</P>
<P>THIS theme is more important, where early and virtuous marriage is the source for increasing the numbers, the wealth and prosperity of a country, and preserving purity of morals, Idleness, extra∣vagance and pride discourage this. Very few will connect themselves willingly, in holy wedlock, with those, who do not in return for love and pro∣tection, favour them with generous sentiments, in∣dustry, economy, frugality, neatness, patience, for∣titude, temperance and chastity.</P>
<P>WERE the opulent duly impressed with the un∣certainty of riches, and how suddenly they may flee away; and were the poor instructed in the various branches of female industry, both would escape one half the miseries in life.</P>
<P>WHEN house, land and friends, are gone forever, the virtuous mind, the well informed head, and hands taught to work, have found new resources for sup∣plying
<PB N="18" REF="023649_0017_0FC08D6F9EA3E328"/>
their wants, which might otherwise have ended their days, or landed them in despair. The world is more than half indebted to the female sex, for the preservation of religion—for security and prosperity in society, and for peace and happi∣ness in domestic life.</P>
<P>MEN of libertine principles may affect to ridi∣cule this subject; but observe their caution, least they become the wedded companion of one who is opposite to the character of good. How seldom is this the case? How frequently do they impose their vices and infirmities upon the purest and most an∣gelic part of the female sex! Their reverential awe, and aukward bashfulness in the presence of amiable females, proves also that they revere such in their hearts. In no company is the profligate so soon silenced and abashed, as in that of the good woman I have described. They are wounded at the envi∣ed attention and preference that she pays to the su∣perior worth, virtue and knowledge of pious and good men. The harrowed breast—the jealous h<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d, here shew themselves, by the silent tongue— the downcast eye, and prudent retreat.</P>
<P>BY spreading such truths as these far and wide, we are doing our duty to God—are in the <HI>only</HI> road to
<PB N="19" REF="023649_0018_0FC08D71A6309898"/>
secure the honour and prosperity of our families, and the blessings of civilization.</P>
<P>THE industry of the good wife we have descri∣bed, is too important a part of her character to be passed over without particular notice. In antient days it was not unfashionable for a Queen to attend to manufactures; costly dress and elegant living were as well, if not better known then, than at pre∣sent. It is not <HI>degrading</HI> but <HI>exalting</HI> the female character to say, that their education is not complete until they are versed in the various branches of ma∣nufactures which are necessary for their housholds; I am proud to confess that I am supported in these ideas, by innumerable examples which ladies of the first excellence and wealth in America have set. A few voluntary associations, or a more frequent exhibition of their industry in their dress would ex∣tend and preserve the practice where it is omitted. A knowledge of the distaff, wheel and loom is no disgrace, but a glory to the most exalted. Every man, by the constitution, is born with an equal right to be elected to the highest office. And every woman, is born with an equal right to be the wife of the most eminent man. Let it therefore be our business, to see that each be possessed of those virtues
<PB N="20" REF="023649_0019_0FC08D7323FE4F48"/>
and accomplishments which form the useful and elevated character. The peculiar nature of the oc∣cupations of women, gives them every necessary art, at a much earlier period in life than men can obtain a knowledge of the laborious and extensive business that naturally fails to their share. The needle and distaff may be early put into the manage∣ment of females, and go hand in hand with the important branches of reading, writing, arithmetic, accounts, geography, history and poetry.</P>
<P>THE employments of the needle are one of the branches of instruction in this Academy. The useful first and then the ornamental. This last opens a broad field to exercise the ingenuity and amuse the mind, while they are forming a landscape or imitating the various shapes and tinges of a flower, with their needle or pencil, they are im∣perceptibly led to admire and adore the power of the Great Creator, who has clothed the lily of the field with greater beauties than Solomon was array∣ed with in all his glory. Here the opulent may amuse themselves in decorating their persons and houses. Here the indigent may earn bread, by delivering their labours to the merchant, as the women of the east did and now do girdles
<PB N="21" REF="023649_0020_0FC08D8164ECC240"/>
and other specimens of industry. A general diffu∣sion of these branches affords an opportunity for each to follow that to which her fancy leads. Learned women are valuable, but give me leave to observe, that industrious women generally make the best wives.</P>
<P>MUSIC, and particularly the vocal, deserved∣ly demands cultivation; principally as it relates to praise—that sublime part of public worship, in which every one ought to share; from which pride or any wrong sentiment ought not to lead us to withdraw. Both men and women of the greatest respectability in our country have, and their children do every Sunday perform a part in choirs and singing seats. Much discouragement arises on this head from an ungracious reluctance: an affected cough or cold: This often disgusts and offends— affords an opportunity to deny that pleasure which enlivens company and cheers the sad. Good sing∣ers are often the most disobliging persons we meet with.</P>
<P>DANCING forms a part of education as it be∣gets that easy deportment which makes us appear less aukward and restrained in company. It is an innocent recreation and relaxation for the sedentary.
<PB N="22" REF="023649_0021_0FC08D82E8BF32B8"/>
It promotes health and cheerfulness. It is part of the amusement of social hours among friends and strangers—among persons of various pursuits and principles. It wears away the rust of prejudice. Seeing each other in their best dress and most plea∣sant face, the blood being set into circulation by motion and music, spleen flies —harmony reigns, and imperceptibly diffuses its pleasing effects. But all these, under the strictest rules of decorum and good order.</P>
<P>THE character of the virtuous woman I have drawn, is from the bible. The thoughts are princi∣pally adapted to the pastoral and agricultural state. The patriarchs and their descendents in Judea, were principally engaged as shepherds and tillers of the ground. Similar in a great degree is the situa∣tion of the United States. Agriculture and manu∣factures are the foundation of our national wealth and prosperity; they ought to be promoted by all classes of citizens. They lead to industry—and preserve health, virtue and piety. The volume of inspiration is doubly enhanced, and more worthy to be studied to form good men and women, as the characters are real. We need not search the wri∣ters of romance and fiction, of poets or fine writers for this purpose. The heart cannot be so well re∣gulated
<PB N="23" REF="023649_0022_0FC08D8467005060"/>
or head instructed and useful manners form∣ed, as from that book which also contains the words of eternal life.—The grand adversary of man, never invented a better plan to build up his kingdom, than when he banished the bible from schools, and led men of real abilities and learning to join in the system, from <HI>affected</HI> reverence to its character.— Others improving upon the idea, have made it an engine by which to introduce infidelity. If this is not the case, why are deists and their abettors, so te∣nacious and zealous on this head? I hope Ameri∣cans will awake to wisdom, and while they avoid se∣lecting portions of scripture to be committed to memory by school-boys as a penance for faults, they will permit it to be read as a privilege in school, as a mark of honour and favour to those who have farthest advanced in good morals and reading.</P>
<P>No volume affords so useful a field, for tuning the voice to the various sentiments of the writers in order to benefit both reader and hearer as this. The four gospels afford a stile peculiarly adapted to all readers. Many of the most celebrated public speakers, in these States, both in the pulpit and at the bar, were taught reading in the bible: <HI>They</HI> have
<PB N="24" REF="023649_0023_0FC08D919F063708"/>
not lost their reverence and love for it: It has not acquired such indifference in their minds, as to be <HI>idly</HI> called in to lengthen out an oration or conver∣sation: Is never used by them, but upon occasions most worthy the sanction of God's word. They blush for others, who vilely debase it to common and improper purposes. While our citizens retain the bible in their possession and the reading of it in our schools and families, a most important mean is improved, to gain good morals, pure religion and that happy middle-state between poverty and rich∣es. The sacred oracles contain a sublimity and purity, which like other excellent productions, nev∣er weary by use. They form pure and elegant manners, free from pomp and ostentation—from au∣sterity and gloominess. There we find all the du∣ties to God and our neighbour. There we are taught subordination to superiors.</P>
<P>UNDER this last is included our duty to our in∣structors of every kind. Unless children know how to <HI>obey,</HI> they will never be qualified to <HI>command.</HI>— Those who are not properly governed at home are seldom orderly in school, but often disgrace them∣selves and parents, and injure others by their unto∣ward behaviour. Parents and children are to be
<PB N="25" REF="023649_0024_0FC08D92A1676058"/>
pitied for their neglect herein. It is from defects in family government, that magistrates and instruc∣tors have much trouble.</P>
<P>WE ought also to strengthen the hands of instruct∣ors and not degrade them. I never envied the feli∣city of those who have erred on this head;— bad children, disorderly youth, and proud, unruly men, have amply punished them for their impru∣dence.— Very difficult is the task to regulate the various tempers in a school: much patience, forti∣tude, wisdom and prudence are necessary; we ought not therefore to make the task doubly ardu∣ous, by our childish inteference.</P>
<P>PRIDE is always ready to intrude itself to interrupt our ideas on the subject of female education, and leads many to despise industry, with the pretence that it is not genteel to work: As if we had one order of men, who are to be aggrandized by degrading of another. An American's heart revolts at this idea —we know and ought to practise differently.— True gentility is founded upon christian charity— that best of graces, which wishes and endeavours to do good to all; Its votaries are always humble, courteous, affectionate, wise and gentle. Riches
<PB N="26" REF="023649_0025_0FC08D9D6DD1B898"/>
are often the portion of the vilest of men, they confer no worth upon the possessor, any farther than with them he makes others happy. They often con∣ceal a wicked and heavy heart. Luxury and fashions are sometimes studied and indulged to cast a veil over real faults, and to compensate for sub∣stantial injuries. He who founds an asylum for distress—He who introduces an useful art by which the poor may earn bread, or rescues a fellow mortal from destruction, is more deserving of a statue, than he who conquers a globe—and an industrious good wife is a more noble personage than a million of fashionable flutterers. Virtue and merit are not known by title or parade, but by generous, manly, humane, disinterested actions. Art and address often procure means to make an appearance before the world, even in public men; while a country may basely leave their most meritorious citizens to beggary and insult from those who are exalted by the revolution of those affairs, which have made others miserable. Thus uncertain are all those things which dazzle the eye, and lead the heart to place its happiness in the uncertain pomp and pelf of this world.</P>
<P>OUR good or bad fortunes are very little in our power. Providence permits one to rise and ano∣ther
<PB N="27" REF="023649_0026_0FC08D9EB080E690"/>
to fall, in the language of mortals; but, many a beggar will be accepted at his bar, when the rich and the gay may be cast out. The great concern is to maintain our integrity—to take heed least adversity discourage us, or land us in vice. It is criminal to become worse by misfortune; but to amend is our glory. When I contemplate the real condition of many female orphans—the losses of families from the want of knowledge of business, in widowed mothers, and the cruel rapine and plunder committed upon their property—When I recall the lamentations and complaints of many, from men we would blush to mention, I am irresistibly drawn to wish for that fortunate hour, when public or private benevolence will found institutions also for depositing their property or shelters for their per∣sons, and places for their education.</P>
<P>THAT such asylums may be erected is proved by the experiment already made by a <HI>protestant</HI> com∣munion, in our own country; where young females are annualy sent from other places for education. More specimens of ingenuity, and more useful ma∣nufactures are annually sent from that society to market, than from any other place in America. They thereby check costly importations in this
<PB N="28" REF="023649_0027_0FC08DA024C66208"/>
line from abroad, and derive profit to their com∣munity. All these things are done under the im∣mediate direction of their own sex, with a con∣stant opportunity to grow in christian knowledge; free from temptations to learn or commit wicked∣ness.</P>
<P>BUT because we have heard of Roman Catholic nunneries, and <HI>idly</HI> abhor every thing that has the approbation of Papists (however <HI>excellent</HI>) we run into the opposite extreme. Where is the harm, if men or women chuse a state of celibacy during the whole or part of their lives? why may they not devote themselves in a retirement, to the duties of piety, humility, humanity and industry? Is not their labour a sufficient source of profit to compen∣sate for protection? — But, if we wish to encourage early marriage, can this be effected in any better way than by giving our youth the best education, to enable them to maintain themselves and families? Must we permit a promiscuous intercourse of both sexes—and give full latitude to all the visionary fancies of poets and romance writers on the subject of love, rather than form systems of real and per∣manent use; and leave youth exposed to fortune-hunters and spendthrifts? Men of real virtue prefer
<PB N="29" REF="023649_0028_0FC08DAD7A071270"/>
a companion who is not educated among the croud of idlers. Leading or indulging in fashions and gaiety, confers no real excellence upon men or women: Those who do, are the least esteemed in the opinion of the wise and good. True gentility needs no plumes, its own excellencies shine without them.</P>
<P>A VERY powerful argument presents itself upon the subject of education, as we are a country of pro∣fessed patriots; who have contended for the rights of posterity. Shall we neglect to provide for the instruction of that posterity, and leave them to live and die in ignorance—and consequently plunge them in vice and destruction? If we do this by our own children, let us not forget the memory of those who fought, bled and died in the late war.—Who have left large families to be guarded and protected by the country; who have not only lost their pa∣rents, but property also. Shall religion and patri∣otism have no influence with us on this subject? What must posterity say?—What will Britons judge of our principles and national character?— Engage in a war—call it a war of God—for the rights of men, and neglect in peace to afford the best blessing in life to our young and defenceless citizens.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="023649_0029_0FC08DAF31FE4378"/>AS OUR children are to be made christians and patriots, this subject is of the highest national con∣cern. It will promote our prosperity far sooner than a fleet or army. Next to good laws and <HI>vir∣tuous</HI> lawgivers and rulers, it will promote our highest prosperity.</P>
<P>ANOTHER important argument, why the educa∣tion of youth should be <HI>national</HI> and not of party care, is that thereby the greatest benefit may arise to our children, when the encouragement and springs to application are equal. If the rewards for eminence are not in the public gift, men of the first character for learning and usefulness may be neglected because they are not the favorites of par∣tial systems. Nay, what is equally to be avoided, they lose the benefit of those institutions that their fathers and friends have formed and patronized. Until the education of youth is more particularly under the public care than at present, we cannot <HI>decently</HI> ask the aid of a public purse. If we at∣tempt it, we unfairly attempt to draw money from freemen without their consent, and compel them to support systems that conscience leads them to wish might be altered, and under which many groan.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="023649_0030_0FC08DB0E0552150"/>THESE are true liberty principles: I deliver them to you in love as a freeman. I am supported in them by many classes of our best citizens; their writings, valour and sufferings have sealed their belief in them. By undisguisedly acting up to them, we begin to form a general system—shall prevent rival institutions from multiplying unne∣cessarily, while none are properly supported. Then may we hope to see the education of our daughters the subject of united aid. Then shall we sacrilegi∣ously pervert no man's charity—offend no christian brother, but with double energy promote the im∣portant purposes of true religion, good government, equal liberty and pure love.</P>
<P>SOME of these last thoughts refer principally to literary institutions, and where parents are opulent. But foundations to make the children of the poor useful, and to give them an opportunity to reap the benefit of those good, and perhaps great abilities, which Heaven has bestowed upon them as a rich gift, are equally the objects of public care. They are considered as such in other countries. The mechanic and every other art, has been improved, and the world blessed by their labours, while many who have been born to inherit great estates, and
<PB N="32" REF="023649_0031_0FC08DBD63AC2808"/>
were allied to influential friends, have become vici∣ous, and disgraced human nature.</P>
<P>WHEN we endeavour to form the female for hap∣piness and usefulness, that she may be able to plead her own cause—defend her own rights, and in a good degree protect her own family against the in∣justice of men; let me also warn women that they do not oppress their own sex, and betray their in∣terest and honor into the power of ours: Let not covetousness, unjust resentment or cruel neglect, lead you to trespass against the laws of piety, or the rules of right, and debase the native tenderness and delicacy of your part of the creation. Take heed that artful men do not make you accessary to your own destruction, and having led you to injure others, plot against, and undermine your own pros∣perity. Beware least you encourage vicious, debi∣litated, diseased and base men in their wanton out∣rages upon females. Remember how great is the reward for protecting the defenceless, the weak and inexperienced:—Remove them from temptation— correct their errors—restore their spirits—provoke them to virtue—teach them to reverence them∣selves. Inculcate the importance of the female character, give them just ideas of themselves and
<PB N="33" REF="023649_0032_0FC08DC2DB6FB268"/>
others:—See to it that idle visionary thoughts have no place in their minds—When called to connect themselves for life, let them be informed, that love is formed in mutual esteem and mutual interest—that the eye has a very small share in forming just and durable attachments. Piety is the foundation, and virtue the structure to be built by matrimonial alli∣ances. Without this, love will soon be exchanged for indifference and disgust; and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> end in those ways which are the ways of hell—and lead down to the chambers of death.</P>
<P>VERY many of the thoughts contained in this ad∣dress are presented to you, my female friends, of this Academy, for your serious consideration; as well as others in this every numerous assembly. This subject is copious and pleasing. I wish it may be beneficial. It depends much upon your conduct and the application of the instructions you receive from your parents and teachers in general, and especially from your preceptor and masters—and that amiable lady, your governess, whether you are happy and respected in life.</P>
<P>MOST becoming is it for you in their presence and in all other places, to let a teachable and orderly

Remember that it is very se<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦dom that a stubborn disobedient youth is amiab<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> or revered in age. We trust your deportment a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> improvement will do honour to yourselves and friends; and gain reputation to the Female Aca∣demy in Portsmouth, and such rewards to its foun∣der and director, as may enable him to make it more and more useful.</P>
<P>I NEED not my friends, in general, remind you of the critical situation of the young female; ren∣dered doubly so, from the <HI>shameful</HI> neglect in the execution of the laws by which they are to be guarded. We see their base destroyers rise to places of honour and profit, from the silence and lost in∣fluence of men of virtue and patriotism; from a depravity of morals that ought to be amended. While the unfortunate female may be doomed to destruction or disgrace by the tyranny of custom, end the severity of her own sex. As no recept<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦cles exist, to which they may retire from the ga<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the world—as the honour and felicity of our <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦milies are so largely embarked in their virtu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and becoming behavior, it is a subject of the utm<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> importance, that every one of us, give all pos∣sible

encouragement to their virtuous and useful education, and take every possible pains to make them happy and respected.</P>
<P>MAY God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, bless, preserve and keep you. The Lord mercifully with his favour look upon you, and give you such heavenly wisdom and grace, that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou may all so conduct yourselves in this world, that in the world to come, you may have life ever∣lasting.</P>
