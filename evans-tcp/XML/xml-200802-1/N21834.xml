<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>MY life has for several years been a theatre of calamity. I have been a mark for the vigilance of tyranny, and I could not escape. My fairest pros∣pects have been blasted. My enemy has shown himself inaccessible to intreaties and untired in persecution. My fame, as well as my happiness, has become his victim. Every one, as far as my story has been known, has refused to assist me in my distress, and has execrated my name. I have not deserved this treatment. My own conscience witnesses in behalf of that innocence my pretensions
<PB N="2" REF="028752_0004_0FDBEF4938E29388"/>
to which are regarded in the world as incredible. There is now however little hope that I shall escape from the toils that universally beset me. I am in∣cited to the penning of these memoirs, only by a desire to divert my mind from the deplorableness of my situation, and a faint idea that posterity may by their means be induced to render me a justice which my contemporaries refuse. My story will at least appear to have that consistency, which is seldom attendant but upon truth.</P>
<P>I was born of humble parents in a remote coun∣ty of England. Their occupations were such as usually fall to the lot of peasants, and they had no portion to give me but an education free from the usual sources of depravity, and the inheritance, long since lost by their unfortunate progeny! of an honest fame. I was taught the rudiments of no science, except reading, writing and arithmetic. But I had an inquisitive mind, and neglected no means of information from conversation or books. My improvement was greater than my condition in life afforded room to expect.</P>
<P>Our residence was within the manor of Fer∣dinando Falkland, a country squire of considerable opulence. At an early age I attracted the favour∣able notice of Mr. Collins, this gentleman's steward, who used to call in occasionally at my father's. He observed the particulars of my progress with approbation, and made a favourable report to his master of my industry and genius.</P>
<P>In the summer of the year <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> Mr. Falk∣land visited his estate in our county after an absence of several months. This was a period of misfor∣tune to me. I was then eighteen years of age. My father lay dead in our cottage. I had lost my mother some years before. In this forlorn situation I was surprised with a message from the squire,
<PB N="3" REF="028752_0005_0FDEB4598DB10528"/>
ordering me to repair to the mansion-house the morning after my father's funeral.</P>
<P>Though I was not a stranger to books, I had no practical acquaintance with men. I had never had occasion to address a person of this elevated rank, and I felt no small uneasiness and awe on the pre∣sent occasion. I found Mr Falkland a man of small stature, with an extreme <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of form and appearance. In place of the hard-favoured and inflexible visages I had been accustomed to ob∣serve, every muscle and petty line of his coun∣tenance seemed to be in an inconceivable degree pregnant with meaning. His manner was kind, attentive and humane. His eye was full of ani∣mation, but there was a grave and sad solemnity in his air, which for want of experience I imagined was the inheritance of the great, and the instru∣ment by which the distance between them and their inferiors was maintained. His look bespoke the unquietness of his mind, and frequently wan∣dered with an expression of disconsolateness and anxiety.</P>
<P>My reception was as gracious and encouraging as I could possibly desire. Mr. Falkland questioned me respecting my learning, and my conceptions of men and things, and listened to my answers with condescension and approbation. This kindness soon restored to me a considerable part of myself-possession, though I still felt restrained by the graceful, but unaltered dignity of his carriage. I have already said that I was not unacquainted with books. I had not failed to derive advantage from the opportunities which offered themselves, and some of those opportunities were of very for∣tunate occurrence. But it is not my purpose to draw out this narrative by unnecessary detail; I leave the reader to collect what my acquisitions had been from the incidents which followed. When
<PB N="4" REF="028752_0006_0FDBEF4C79362DE0"/>
Mr. Falkland had sufficiently satisfied his curiosity, he proceeded to inform me that he was in want of a secretary, that I appeared to him sufficiently qualified for that office, and that, if in my present change of situation occasioned by the death of my father I approved of the employment, he would take me into his family.</P>
<P>I felt highly flattered by the proposal, and was warm in the expression of my acknowledgements. I set eagerly about the disposal of the little property my father had left, in which I was assisted by Mr. Collins. I had not now a relation, upon whose kindness and interposition I had any direct claim, in the world. But far from regarding this deserted situation with terror, I formed golden visions of the station I was about to occupy. I little suspected that the gaiety and lightness of heart I had hitherto enjoyed were upon the point of leaving me for ever, and that the rest of my days were devoted to misery and alarm.</P>
<P>My employment was easy and agreeable. It consisted partly of the transcribing and arranging certain papers, and partly of writing from my master's dictation letters of business, as well as sketches of literary composition. Many of these latter consisted of an analytical survey of the plans of different authors, and conjectural speculations upon hints they afforded, tending either to the de∣tection of their errors or the carrying forward their discoveries. All of them bore powerful marks of a profound and elegant understanding, well stored with literature, and possessed of an uncommon share of activity and discrimination.</P>
<P>My station was in that part of the house which was appropriated for the reception of books, it be∣ing my duty to perform the functions of librarian as well as secretary. Here my hours would have glided in tranquillity and peace, had not my situa∣tion
<PB N="5" REF="028752_0007_0FDEB433B683E308"/>
included in it circumstances totally different from those which attended me in my father's cot∣tage. In early life my mind had been almost wholly engrossed by reading and reflexion. My intercourses with my fellow mortals were occasional and short. But in my new residence I was excited by every motive of interest and curiosity to study my master's character, and I found in it an am∣ple field for speculation and conjecture.</P>
<P>His mode of living was in the utmost degree recluse and solitary. He had no inclination to scenes of revelry and mirth. He avoided the busy haunts of men; nor did he seem desirous to com∣pensate for this privation by the confidence of friendship. He appeared a total stranger to every thing which usually bears the appellation of plea∣sure. His features were scarcely ever relaxed into a smile, nor did that air which bespoke the unhap∣piness of his mind, at any time forsake them. Yet his manners were by no means such as denoted moroseness and misanthropy. He was compas∣sionate and considerate for others, though the state∣liness of his carriage and the reserve of his temper were at no time interrupted. His appearance and general behaviour might have strongly interested all persons in his favour; but the coldness of his address and the impenetrableness of his sentiments seemed to forbid those demonstrations of kind∣ness to which one might otherwise have been prompted.</P>
<P>Such was the general appearance of Mr. Falk∣land; but his temper was extremely unequal. The distemper which afflicted him with incessant gloom, had its paroxysms. Sometimes he was hasty, peevish and tyrannical; but this proceeded rather from the torment of his mind than an unfeeling disposition, and, when reflexion recurred, he ap∣peared willing that the weight of his misfortune
<PB N="6" REF="028752_0008_0FDBEF4E5372D220"/>
should fall wholly upon himself. Sometimes he entirely lost his self possession, and his behaviour was changed into frenzy. He would strike his forehead, his brows became knit, his features dis∣torted, and his teeth ground one against the other. When he felt the approach of these symptoms, he would suddenly rise, and, leaving the occupation whatever it was in which he was engaged, hasten into a solitude upon which no person dared to in∣trude.</P>
<P>It must not be supposed that the whole of what I am describing was visible to the persons about him; nor indeed was I acquainted with it in the extent here stated, but after a considerable time, and in gradual succession. With respect to the domestics in general, they saw but little of their master. None of them, except myself from the nature of my functions, and Mr. Collins from the antiquity of his service and the respectableness of his character, approached Mr. Falkland, but at stated seasons and for a very short interval. They knew him only by the benevolence of his actions and the principles of inflexible integrity by which he was ordinarily guided; and, though they would sometimes indulge their conjectures respecting his singularities, regarded him upon the whole with veneration as a being of a superior order.</P>
<P>One day when I had been about three months in the service of my patron, I went into a closet or small apartment which was separated from the library by a narrow gallery that was lighted by a small window near the roof. I had conceived that there was no person in the room, and went only to put any thing in order that I might find out of its place. As I opened the door, I heard at the same instant a deep groan expressive of intolerable an∣guish. The sound of the door in opening seemed to alarm the person within; I heard the lid of a
<PB N="7" REF="028752_0009_0FDEB4353B01BA68"/>
chest hastily shut, and the noise as of fastening a lock. I immediately conceived that Mr. Falkland was there, and was going hastily to retire; but at that moment a voice that seemed supernaturally tremendous exclaimed, Who is there? The voice was Mr. Falkland's. The sound of it thrilled my very vitals. I endeavoured to answer, but my speech failed, and being incapable of any other reply, I instinctively advanced within the door into the room. Mr. Falkland was just risen from the floor upon which he had been sitting or kneeling. His countenance betrayed strong symptoms of con∣fusion. With a violent effort however these symp∣toms suddenly vanished, and instantaneously gave place to a countenance sparkling with rage. Vil∣lain, cried he, what has brought you here? I he∣sitated a confused and irresolute answer. Wretch, interrupted Mr. Falkland with uncontrolable im∣patience, you want to ruin me. You set yourself as a spy upon my actions. But bitterly shall you repent your insolence. Do you think you shall watch my privacies with impunity? I attempted to defend myself. Begone, devil! rejoined he. Quit the room, or I will trample you into atoms. Saying this, he advanced towards me. But I was already sufficiently terrified, and vanished in a mo∣ment. I heard the door shut after me with vio∣lence, and thus ended this extraordinary scene.</P>
<P>I saw him again in the evening, and he was then tolerably composed. His behaviour, which was always kind, was now doubly attentive and sooth∣ing. He seemed to have something of which he wished to disburthen his mind, but to want words in which to convey it. I looked at him with anx∣iety and affection. He made two unsuccessful efforts, shook his head, and then, putting five guineas into my hand, pressed it in a manner that I could feel proceeded from a mind pregnant with
<PB N="8" REF="028752_0010_0FDBEF53206B6C58"/>
various emotions, though I could not interpret them. Having done this, he seemed immediately to recollect himself, and to take refuge in the usual distance and solemnity of his manner.</P>
<P>I easily understood that secrecy was one of the things expected from me, and indeed my mind was too much disposed to meditate upon what I had heard and seen, to make it a topic of indiscri∣minate communication. Mr. Collins however and myself happened to sup together that evening, which was but seldom the case, his avocations obliging him to be much abroad. He could not help observing an uncommon dejection and anxiety in my countenance, and affectionately enquired into the reason. I endeavoured to evade his ques∣tions, but my youth and ignorance of the world gave me but little advantage for that purpose. Beside this, I had been accustomed to view Mr. Collins with considerable attachment, and I con∣ceived from the nature of his situation that there could be but small impropriety in making him my confident in the present instance. I repeated to him minutely every thing that had passed, and con∣cluded with a solemn declaration that, though treated with caprice, I was not anxious for my∣self: no inconvenience or danger to myself should ever lead me to a pusillanimous behaviour; and I felt only for my master, who, with every advan∣tage for happiness, and being in the highest degree worthy of it, seemed fated to undergo unmerited distress.</P>
<P>In answer to my communication Mr. Collins in∣formed me that some incidents of a nature similar to that which I related had fallen under his own knowledge, and that from the whole he could not help concluding that our unfortunate patron was at times disordered in his intellects. Alas, continued he, it was not always thus! Ferdinando
<PB N="9" REF="028752_0011_0FDEB43A98E34EB0"/>
Falkland was once the gayest of the gay. Not in∣deed of that frothy sort, who excite contempt in∣stead of admiration, and whose levity argues thoughtlessness rather than felicity. His gaiety was always accompanied with dignity. It was chastened with reflexion and sensibility, and never lost sight either of good taste or humanity. Such as it was however, it denoted a genuine hilarity of heart, gave an inconceivable brilliancy to his com∣pany and conversation, and rendered him the per∣petual delight of the diversified circles he then wil∣lingly frequented. You see nothing of him, my dear Williams, but the ruin of that Falkland, who was courted by sages, and adored by the fair. His youth, distinguished in its outset by the most ge∣nerous promise, is tarnished. His sensibility is shrunk up and withered by events the most dis∣gustful to his feelings. His mind was fraught with all the rhapsodies of visionary honour; and in his sense nothing but the gro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er part, the mere shell of Falkland, was capable to survive the wound that his pride has sustained.</P>
<P>These reflexions of my friend Collins strongly tended to inflame my curiosity, and I requested him to enter into a more copious explanation. With this request he readily complied; as con∣ceiving that whatever delicacy it became him to exercise in ordinary cases, it would be out of place in my situation, and thinking it not improbable that Mr. Falkland, but for the disturbance and in∣flammation of his mind, would be disposed to a similar communication. I shall join to Mr. Col∣lins's story various information which I afterwards received from other quarters, that I may give all possible perspicuity to the series of events. To the reader it may appear at first sight as if this detail of the preceding life of Mr. Falkland were foreign to my history. Alas, I know from bitter experi∣ence
<PB N="10" REF="028752_0012_0FDBEF5455C48A50"/>
that it is otherwise. My heart bleeds at the recollection of his misfortunes as if they were my own. How can it fail to do so? To his story the whole fortune of my life was linked; because he was miserable, my happiness, my name, and my existence have been irretrievably blasted.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the favourite authors of his early years were the heroic poets of Italy. From them he imbibed the love of chivalry and romance. He had too much good sense to regret the times of Charlemagne and Arthur. But, while his imagi∣nation was purged by a certain infusion of philo∣sophy, he conceived that there was in the manners depicted by these celebrated poets, something to imitate, as well as something to avoid. He be∣lieved that nothing was so well calculated to make men delicate, gallant and humane, as a temper perpetually alive to the sentiments of birth and honour. The opinions he entertained upon those topics were illustrated in his conduct, which was assiduously conformed to the model of heroism that his fancy suggested.</P>
<P>With these sentiments he set out upon his tra∣vels at the age at which the grand tour is usually made, and they were rather confirmed than shaken by the adventures that be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el him. By inclination he was led to make his longest stay in Italy, and here he fell into company with several young no∣blemen whose studies and principles were congenial to his own. By them he was assiduously courted and treated with the most distinguished applause. They were delighted to meet with a foreigner who had imbibed all the peculiarities of the most liberal and honourable among themselves. Nor was he less favoured and admired by the softer sex. Though his stature were small, his person had an air of uncommon dignity. His dignity was then
<PB N="12" REF="028752_0014_0FDBEF5A6EABCCB8"/>
heightened by certain additions which were after∣wards obliterated, an expression of frankness, in∣genuity and unreserve, and a spirit of the most ardent enthusiasm. Perhaps no Englishman was ever in an equal degree idolised by the inhabitants of Italy.</P>
<P>It was not possible for him to have drank so deeply of the fountain of chivalry without being engaged occasionally in affairs of honour, all of which were terminated in a manner that would not have disgraced the chevalier Bayard himself. In Italy the young men of rank divide themselves into two classes, those who adhere to the pure principles of ancient gallantry, and those who, being actuated by the same acute sense of injury and insult, accustom themselves to the employment of hired bravoes as their instruments of vengeance. The whole difference indeed consists in the preca∣rious application of a generally received distinc∣tion. The most generous Italian still conceives that there are certain persons whom it would be contamination to call into the open field. He ne∣vertheless believes that an indignity cannot be expi∣ated but with blood, and is persuaded that the life of a fellow creature is a very trifling consideration in comparison with the indemnification to be made to his injured honour. There is therefore scarcely any Italian that would upon some occasions scruple assassination. Men of spirit among them, not∣withstanding the prejudices of their education, cannot fail to have a secret conviction of its base∣ness, and will be desirous of extending as far as possible the cartel of honour. Real or affected arrogance teaches others to regard almost the whole human species as their inferiors, and of conse∣quence incites them to gratify their vengeance without danger to their persons. Mr. Falkland fell in with some of these. But his undaunted spirit
<PB N="13" REF="028752_0015_0FDEB4409DC18208"/>
and resolute temper gave him a decisive advantage even in such perilous rencounters. One instance among many of his manner of conducting him∣self among this proud and high-spirited people, it may be proper to relate. Mr. Falkland is the principal agent in my history; and Mr. Falkland, in the autumn and decay of his vigour such as I found him, cannot be completely understood with∣out a knowledge of his previous character as it was in all the gloss of youth, yet unassailed by ad∣versity, and unbroken in upon by anguish or re∣morse.</P>
<P>At Rome he was received with particular dis∣tinction at the house of marquis Pisani, who had an only daughter, the heir of his immense fortune, and the admiration of all the young nobility of that metropolis. Lady Lucretia Pisani was tall, of a dignified form and uncommonly beautiful. She was not deficient in amiable qualities, but her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oul was haughty, and her carriage not unfre∣quently contemptuous. Her pride was nourished by the consciousness of her charms, by her ele∣vated rank and the universal adoration she was accustomed to receive.</P>
<P>Among her numerous lovers count Malvesi was the individual most favoured by her father, nor did his addresses seem indifferent to her. The count was a man of considerable accomplishments, and of great integrity and benevolence of dispo∣sition. But he was too ardent a lover to be able always to preserve the affability of his temper. The admirers, whose addresses were a source of gratification to his mistress, were a perpetual tor∣ment to him. Placing his whole happiness in the possession of this imperious beauty, the most trifling circumstances were capable of alarming him for the security of his pretensions. But most of all he was jealous of the English cavalier. The marquis
<PB N="14" REF="028752_0016_0FDBEF5BD2CF8D40"/>
Pisani, who had spent many years in France, was by no means partial to the suspicious precautions of Italian fathers, and indulged his daughter in considerable freedoms. His house and his daugh∣ter, within certain judicious restraints, were open to the resort of male visitants. But above all Mr. Falkland, as a foreigner, and a person little likely to form pretensions to the hand of Lucretia, was received upon a footing of great familiarity. The lady herself, conscious of her innocence, enter∣tained no scruple about trifles, and acted with the confidence and frankness of one who is superior to suspicion.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland, after a residence of several weeks at Rome, proceeded to Naples. Mean while cer∣tain incidents occurred that delayed the intended nuptials of the heiress of Pisani. When he re∣turned to Rome count Malvesi was absent. Lady Lucretia, who had been considerably amused before with the conversation of Mr. Falkland, and who had an active and enquiring mind, had conceived in the interval between his first and second residence at Rome a passion for learning the English lan∣guage, inspired by the lively and ardent encomi∣ums of our best authors that she had heard from their countryman. She had provided herself with the usual implements for that purpose, and made some progress during his absence. But upon his return she was desirous of making use of the op∣portunity which, if missed, might never occur again with equal advantages, of reading select passages of our poets in company with an English∣man of uncommon taste and capacity.</P>
<P>This proposal necessarily led to a more frequent intercourse. When count Malvesi returned, he found Mr. Falkland established almost as an inmate of the Pisani palace. His mind could not fail to be struck with the criticalness of the situation. He
<PB N="15" REF="028752_0017_0FDEB442212C33E8"/>
was perhaps secretly conscious that the qualifica∣tions of the Englishman were superior to his own, and he trembled for the progress that each of them might have made in the affection of the other, even before they were aware of the danger. He believed that the match was in every respect such as to flatter the ambition of Mr. Falkland, and he was stung even to madness by the idea of being de∣prived of the object dearest to his heart by this insolent upstart.</P>
<P>He had however a sufficient share of discretion to go first to demand an explanation of lady Lu∣cretia. She in the gaiety of her heart trifled with his anxiety. His patience was already exhausted, and he proceeded in his expostulation in language that it was by no means possible for her to endure with apathy. Lady Lucretia had always been ac∣customed to deference and submission; and having got over something like terror that was first inspired by the imperious manner in which he was now ca∣techised, her next feeling was that of the warmest resentment. She disdained to satisfy so insolent a questioner, and even indulged herself in some ob∣lique hints calculated to strengthen his suspicions. For some time she described his folly and presump∣tion in terms of the most ludicrous sarcasm, and then suddenly changing her style, bid him never let her see him more except upon a footing of the most distance acquaintance, as she was determined never again to subject herself to so unworthy and inexcusable a treatment. She was happy that he had at length disclosed to her his true character, and would well know how to profit of her present experience to avoid a repetition of the same danger. All this passed in the full career of the passions on both sides, and lady Lucretia had no time to reflect what might be the consequence of having thus ex∣asperated her lover.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="028752_0018_0FDBEF5FCF0C7E48"/>
Count Malvesi left her in all the torments of hell. He believed that this was a premeditated scene to find a pretence for breaking off an engage∣ment that was already all but concluded; or rather his mind was racked with a thousand conjectures, he alternately thought that the injustice might be hers or his own, and he quarrelled with lady Lu∣cretia, himself and all the world. In this temper of mind he hastened to the hotel of the English cavalier. The moment of expostulation was now over, and he found himself irresistibly impelled to justify his precipitate conduct with the lady, by taking for granted that the prosperous amours of Falkland were beyond the reach of doubt.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland was at home. The first words of the count were an abrupt accusation of dupli∣city in the affair of lady Lucretia, and a challenge. The Englishman had an unaffected esteem for Mal∣vesi, who was in reality a man of considerable merit, and who had been one of Mr. Falkland's earliest Italian acquaintance, they having originally met at Milan. But more than this, the possible consequences of a duel in the present instance burst upon his mind. He had the warmest admiration for lady Lucretia, though his feelings were not those of a lover: and he knew that, however her haughtiness might endeavour to disguise it, she was impressed with a tender regard for count Mal∣vesi. He could not bear to think that any miscon∣duct of his should interrupt the prospects of so de∣serving a pair. Guided by these sentiments he en∣deavoured to expostulate with the Italian. But all his attempts in this respect were ineffectual. His antagonist was drunk with choler, and would not listen to a word that tended to check the impetuo∣sity of his thoughts. He traversed the room with perturbed steps, and even foamed with anguish and fury. Mr. Falkland, finding that every thing
<PB N="17" REF="028752_0019_0FDEB449865B0B70"/>
else was to no purpose, told the count that, if he would return tomorrow at the same hour, he would attend him to any scene of action he would think proper to select.</P>
<P>From count Malvesi Mr. Falkland immediately proceeded to the palace of Pisani. Here <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e found a considerable difficulty in appeasing the indigna∣tion of lady Lucretia. Honour forbad him to dis∣close the cartel he had received, though he was se∣cretly determined never to draw his sword in the present quarrel; otherwise that disclosure would immediately have operated as the strongest motive with this disdainful beauty. But, though she fear∣ed a similar defiance, yet the vague apprehension was not strong enough to induce her without qua∣lification to surrender all the stateliness of her re∣sentment. Mr. Falkland however drew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o interest∣ing a picture of the disturbance of count Malvesi's mind, and accounted in so flattering a manner for the abruptness of his conduct, that this, together with the arguments he adduced, completed the conquest of lady Lucretia's resentment. Having thus far accomplished his purpose, he proceeded to disclose to her every thing that had passed.</P>
<P>The next day count Malvesi appeared, punctual to his appointment, at Mr. Falkland's hotel. Mr. Falkland came to the door to receive him, but re∣quested him to enter the house for a moment, as he had still an affair of three minutes to dispatch. They proceeded to a parlour. Here Mr. Falkland left him, and presently returned leading in lady Lucretia herself adorned in all her charms, and those charms heightened upon the present occasion with a consciousness of the spirited and generous condescension she now exerted. Mr. Falkland led her up to the astonished count; and she, gently laying her hand upon the arm of her lover, ex∣claimed with the most attractive grace, Will you
<PB N="18" REF="028752_0020_0FDBEF639D50C6A8"/>
allow me to retract the precipitate haughtiness into which I was betrayed? The enraptured count, scarcely able to believe his senses, threw himself upon his knees before her, and stammered out a reply, signifying that the precipitation had been all his own, that he only had any forgiveness to de∣mand, and, though they might pardon, he could never pardon himself for the sacrilege he had com∣mitted against her and this god-like Englishman. As soon as the first tumults of his joy were subsided, Mr. Falkland addressed him thus:</P>
<P>"Count Malvesi, I feel the utmost pleasure in having thus by peaceful means disarmed your re∣sentment, and effected your happiness. But I must confess you put me to a severe trial. My temper is not less impetuous and fiery than your own, and it is not at all times that I should have been thus able to subdue it. But I considered that in reality the original blame was mine. Though your sus∣picion was groundless, it was not absurd. We have been trifling too much in the face of danger. I ought not, under the present weakness of our nature and forms of society, to have been so assi∣duous in my attendance upon this enchanting wo∣man. It would have been little wonder, if, having so many opportunities, and playing the preceptor with her as I have done, I had been entangled be∣fore I was aware, and harboured a wish which I might not afterwards have had the courage to sub∣due. I owed you an atonement for this impru∣dence.</P>
<P>"But the laws of honour are in the utmost de∣gree rigid, and there was reason to fear that, how∣ever anxious I were to be your friend, I might be obliged to be your murderer. Fortunately the re∣putation of my courage is sufficiently established, not to expose it to any impeachment by my de∣clining your present defiance. It was lucky how∣ever
<PB N="19" REF="028752_0021_0FDEB44C366BC340"/>
that in our interview of yesterday you found me alone, and that accident by that means threw the management of the affair entirely into my dis∣posal. If the transaction should become known, the conclusion would now become known along with the provocation, and I am satisfied. But, if the challenge had been public, the proofs I had formerly given of my courage would not have excused my present moderation; and though de∣sirous to have avoided the combat, it would not have been in my power. Let us hence each of us learn to avoid haste and indiscretion, the conse∣quences of which may be inexpiable but with blood; and may heaven bless you in a consort of whom I deem you every way worthy!"</P>
<P>I have already said that this was by no means the only instance in the course of his travels in which Mr. Falkland acquitted himself in the most bril∣liant manner as a man of gallantry and virtue. He continued abroad during several years, every one of which brought some fresh accession to the estima∣tion in which he was held, as well as to his own impatience of stain or dishonour. At length he thought proper to return to England, with the in∣tention of spending the rest of his days at the resi∣dence of his ancestors.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the moment of his taking a step like this, dictated as it probably was by an unaffected principle of duty, his misfortunes took their com∣mencement. All I have farther to state of his his∣tory is one uninterrupted persecution of a malig∣nant destiny, a series of adventures which seemed to take their rise in various accidents, but pointing to one termination. Him they overwhelmed with an anguish he was of all others least qualified to bear; and these waters of bitterness, extending beyond him, powered their deadly venom upon others, I myself being the most unfortunate of their victims.</P>
<P>The person in whom these calamities principally originated, was Mr. Falkland's nearest neighbour, a man of estate equal to his own, by name, Bar∣nabas Tyrrel. This man one might at first have supposed of all others least qualified from instruc∣tion, or inclined by the habits of his life, to in∣terfere with and disturb the enjoyments of a mind so richly endowed as that of Mr. Falkland. Mr. Tyrrel might have passed for a true model of the English squire. He was very early left under the tuition of his mother, a woman of very narrow capacity, and who had no other child. This mo∣ther seemed to think that there was nothing in the world so precious as her hopeful Barnabas. Every thing must give way to his accommodation and ad∣vantage; every one must yield the most servile obedience to his commands. He must not be teased or restricted by any forms of instruction;
<PB N="21" REF="028752_0023_0FDEB44DC068CC20"/>
and of consequence his proficiency even in the arts of writing and reading was extremely slender. From his birth he was muscular and sturdy; and, confined to the <HI>ruelle</HI> of his mother, he made much such a figure as the whelp-lion that a bar∣barian might have given for a lap-dog to his mis∣tress. But he soon broke loose from these tram∣mels, and formed an acquaintance with the groom and the game-keeper. Under their instruction he proved as ready a scholar as he had been indocile and restive to the pedant who held the office of his tutor. It was now evident that his small pro∣ficiency in literature was by no means to be ascribed to want of capacity. He discovered no contempti∣ble sagacity and quick-wittedness in the science of horse-flesh, and was eminently expert in the arts of shooting, fishing and hunting. Nor did he confine himself to these, but added the theory and practice of boxing, cudgel-play and quarter-staff. These exercises added tenfold robustness and vigour to his former qualifications. His stature, when grown, was somewhat more than six feet, and his form might have been selected by a painter as a model for that hero of antiquity, whose prowess consisted in felling an ox with his fist, and then devouring him at a meal. Conscious of his advantage in this respect, he was insupportably arrogant, tyrannical to his inferiors, and insolent to his equals. The activity of his mind, being diverted from the ge∣nuine field of utility and distinction, showed itself in the rude tricks of an overgrown lubber. Here, as in all other qualifications, he rose above his competitors; and, if it had been possible to over∣look the callous and unrelenting disposition in which they were generated, you would not have denied your applause to the invention these freaks display∣ed, and the rough, sarcastic wit with which they were accompanied.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="028752_0024_0FDBD6BE9C9ADC58"/>
Mr. Tyrrel was by no means inclined to permit these extraordinary merits to rest in oblivion. There was a weekly assembly at the nearest market-town, the resort of all the rural gentry. Here he had hitherto figured to the greatest advantage, as grand master of the <HI>cotérie,</HI> no one among them having an equal share of opulence, and the ma∣jority, though still pretending to the rank of gen∣try, greatly his inferiors in this essential article. The young men in this circle looked up to this in∣solent bashaw with timid respect, conscious of the comparative eminence that unquestionably belonged to the powers of his mind; and he well knew how to maintain his rank with an inflexible hand. Fre∣quently indeed he relaxed his features, and assumed a temporary appearance of affableness and fami∣liarity; but they found by experience, that, if any one, encouraged by his condescension, forgot the deference which Mr. Tyrrel considered as his due, he was soon taught to repent his presumption. It was a tyger that, thought proper to toy with a mouse, the little animal every moment in danger of being crushed by the fangs of his ferocious asso∣ciate. As Mr. Tyrrel had a considerable copious∣ness of speech and a rich but undisciplined ima∣gination, he was always sure of an audience. His neighbours crowded round, and joined in the ready laugh, partly from obsequiousness, and partly from unfeigned admiration. It frequently happened however that in the midst of his good humour a characteristic refinement of tyranny would suggest itself to his mind. When his subjects, encouraged by his familiarity, had discarded their precaution, the wayward fit would seize him, a sudden cloud overspread his brow, his voice transform from the pleasant to the terrible, and a quarrel of a straw immediately ensue with the first man whose face he did not like. The pleasure that resulted to
<PB N="23" REF="028752_0025_0FDEB44F425127A8"/>
others from the exuberant sallies of his imagination was therefore not unalloyed with sudden qualms of apprehension and terror. It may be believed that this despotism did not gain its final ascendancy without being contested in the outset. But all op∣position had been quelled with a high hand by this rural Antaeus. By the ascendancy of his fortune, and his character among his neighbours, he always reduced his adversary to the necessity of encoun∣tering him at his own weapons, and did not dis∣miss him without making him feel his presumption through every joint in his frame. The tyranny of Mr. Tyrrel would not have been so patiently en∣dured, had not his colloquial accomplishments per∣petually come in aid of that authority which his rank and prowess originally obtained.</P>
<P>The situation of our squire with the fair was still more enviable than that which he maintained among persons of his own sex. Every mother taught her daughter to consider the hand of Mr. Tyrrel as the highest object of her ambition. Every daughter regarded his athletic form and his ac∣knowledged prowess with a favourable eye. As no man was adventurous enough to contest his supe∣riority, so hardly any woman in this provincial circle would have scrupled to prefer his addresses to those of any other admirer. His boisterous wit had peculiar charms for them; and there was no spectacle more flattering to their vanity than the seeing this Hercules exchange his club for a dis∣taff. It was pleasing to them to consider that the fangs of this wild beast, the very idea of which inspired trepidation into the boldest hearts, might be played with by them with the utmost security.</P>
<P>The arrival of Mr. Falkland gave a dreadful shock to the authority of Mr. Tyrrel. The dispo∣sition of the former by no means inclined him to withhold himself from scenes of fashionable resort;
<PB N="24" REF="028752_0026_0FDBEF6C5BF71A78"/>
and he and his competitor were like two stars fated never to appear at once above the horizon. The advantages that Mr. Falkland possessed in the com∣parison are palpable; and, had it been otherwise, the subjects of his rustic neighbour were suffi∣ciently disposed to revolt against his merciless domi∣nion. They had hitherto submitted not from love, but fear; and, if they had not actually rebelled, it was only for want of a leader. Even the ladies regarded Mr. Falkland with particular complacence. His polished manners were admirably in unison with feminine delicacy. The sallies of his wit were far beyond those of Mr. Tyrrel in variety and vi∣gour; in addition to which they had the advan∣tage of having their spontaneous exuberance guided and restrained by the sagacity of a cultivated mind. The graces of his person were enhanced by the elegance of his deportment; and the benevolence and liberality of his temper were upon all occasions conspicuous. It was common indeed to Mr. Tyr∣rel together with Mr. Falkland to be little accessible to sentiments of awkwardness and confusion. But for this Mr. Tyrrell was indebted to a self-satisfied effrontery and a boisterous and over-bearing elo∣cution by which he was accustomed to discomfit his assailants; while Mr. Falkland, with great in∣genuity and candour of mind, was enabled, by his extensive knowledge of the world and acquaintance with his own resources, to perceive almost instan∣taneously the proceeding it most became him to adopt.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel contemplated the progress of his rival with uneasiness and aversion. He often comment∣ed upon it to his particular confidents as a thing altogether inconceivable. Mr. Falkland he describ∣ed as an animal that was beneath contempt. Di∣minutive and dwarfish in his form, he wanted to set up a new standard of human nature adapted to
<PB N="25" REF="028752_0027_0FDEB456C9B2AE68"/>
his own miserable condition. He wished to per∣suade people that the human species were made to be nailed to a chair and to pore over books. He would have them exchange those robust exercises which made us joyous in the performance and vigorous in the consequences, for the wise labour of scratching our heads for a rhyme and counting our fingers for a verse. Monkeys were as good men as these. A nation of such animals would have no chance with a single regiment of the old English votaries of beef and pudding. For his own part he never saw any thing come of learning but to make people foppish and impertinent; and a sensible man would not wish any worse calamity to the enemies of his nation than to see them run mad after such pernicious absurdities. It was im∣possible that people could seriously feel any liking for such a ridiculous piece of goods as this out∣landish, foreign-made Englishman. But he knew very well how it was; it was all a miserable piece of mummery that was played only in spite to him. But G—for ever blast his soul, if he were not bit∣terly revenged upon them all!</P>
<P>If such were the sentiments of Mr. Tyrrel, his patience found ample exercise in the language which was held by the rest of his neighbours on the same subject. While he saw nothing in Mr. Falkland but matter for contempt, they appeared to be never weary of recounting his praises. Such dignity, such affability, so perpetual an attention to the hap∣piness of others, such delicacy of sentiment and expression! Learned without ostentation, refined without foppery, elegant without effeminacy! Per∣petually anxious to prevent his superiority either in wealth or accomplishments from being painfully felt, it was felt so much the more certainly, and excited congratulation instead of envy in the spec∣tator. It is hardly necessary to remark that the
<PB N="26" REF="028752_0028_0FDBEF7157C718E0"/>
revolution in this case belongs to one of the most obvious features of the human mind. The rudest exhibition of art is at first admired; till a nobler is presented, and we are taught to wonder at the fa∣cility with which before we had been satisfied. Mr. Tyrrel thought there would be no end to the commendation; and expected when their common acquaintance would fall down and adore him. The most inadvertent expression of applause towards his rival inflicted upon him the torment of demons. He writhed with agony, his features became dis∣torted, and his looks inspired terror. Such suffer∣ing would probably have soured the kindest tem∣per; what must have been its effect upon Mr. Tyr∣rel's, always fierce, unrelenting and abrupt?</P>
<P>The advantages of Mr. Falkland seemed by no means to diminish with their novelty. Every new sufferer from Mr. Tyrrel's tyranny immediately went over to the standard of his adversary. The ladies, though treated by their rustic swain with more gentleness than the men, were occasionally exposed to his capriciousness and insolence. They could not help remarking the contrast between these two leaders in the fields of Venus, the one of whom paid no attention to any one's pleasure but his own, while the other seemed all good humour and bene∣volence. It was in vain that Mr. Tyrrel endea∣voured to restrain the ruggedness of his character. His motive was impatience, his thoughts were gloomy, and his courtship was like the pawings of an elephant. It appeared as if his temper were more human while he had indulged it in its free bent, than now that he sullenly endeavoured to put fetters upon its excesses.</P>
<P>Among the ladies of the village assembly already mentioned there was none that seemed to engage more of the kindness of Mr. Tyrrel than Miss Hardingham. She was also one of the few that
<PB N="27" REF="028752_0029_0FDEB43225F0D460"/>
had not yet gone over to the enemy, either because she really preferred the gentleman who was her oldest acquaintance, or conceiving from calculation that this conduct would best insure success to her object in a husband. One day however she thought proper, probably only by way of temporary expe∣riment, to show Mr. Tyrrel that she could engage in hostilities, if he should at any time give her suffi∣cient provocation. She accordingly so adjusted her manoeuvres as to be engaged by Mr. Falkland as his partner for the dance of the evening, though without the smallest intention on the part of that gentleman of giving offence to his country neigh∣bour.</P>
<P>A short time before the dances began, Mr. Tyr∣rel went up to his fair inamorata, and entered into some trifling conversation with her to fill up the time, as intending in a few minutes to lead her forward to the field. He had accustomed himself to neglect the ceremony of soliciting beforehand a promise in his favour, as not supposing it possible that any one should dare to dispute his behests; and, had it been otherwise, he would have thought the formality unnecessary in this case, his general preference to Miss Hardingham being sufficiently notorious.</P>
<P>While he was thus engaged, Mr. Falkland came up. Mr. Tyrrel always regarded him with aver∣sion and loathing. Mr. Falkland however <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lided in a graceful and unaffected manner into the conver∣sation that was already begun, and the well-mean∣ing ingenuousness of his manner was such, as might for the time have disarmed the devil of his malice. Mr. Tyrrel probably conceived that his accosting Miss Hardingham might be only an accidental piece of general ceremony, and expected every moment when he would withdraw to another part of the
<PB N="28" REF="028752_0030_0FDBEF717A764348"/>
room. Still he staid, as if determined to tire out the patience of the rustic.</P>
<P>The company now began to be in motion for the dance, and Mr. Falkland informed Miss Harding∣ham that it was time to advance.—Sir, interrupted Mr. Tyrrel abruptly, that lady is my partner.—I think not, sir: I apprehend the lady has done me that favour, and I am very sure she has not pro∣mised herself to both.—I tell you, sir, she is mine: I pretend to think that I have some interest in that lady's affections; and I will suffer no man to in∣trude upon my claims.—The lady's affections are not the subject of the present question.—And pray, what is the subject? Observe, sir, I will not re∣cede.—Mr. Tyrrel, there is no need of altercation in the present business: the master of the ceremo∣nies is the proper person to decide; and, as neither of us can intend to disturb the good humour of the assembly, or exhibit our valour before the ladies, we shall either of us chearfully submit to his ver∣dict.—Damn me, sir, if I understand—Softly, Mr. Tyrrel. It really is not worth the while of either of us to quarrel about a question that the forms of good company have long ago decided. I intended you no offence. But, sir, I shall be absolute in asserting that to which I have once acquired a claim. And you will please to observe that it is not my custom to submit to any unbecoming liberties.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland uttered these words with the most even temper in the world. There was not in his manner the slightest appearance of defiance. The words, delivered with a certain tone, might have had the appearance of an a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ront. But they were uttered with the tone of a remonstrance, calm, unassuming, and benevolent, without being con∣temptuous. Miss Hardingham had begun to re∣pent of her experiment, but her alarm was sud∣denly quieted by the irresistible composure of her
<PB N="29" REF="028752_0031_0FDEB45B1135BF18"/>
new partner. Mr. Tyrrel walked away without answering a word. He muttered curses as he went, which the laws of honour did not oblige Mr. Falk∣land to overhear, and which indeed it would have been no easy task to have overheard with accuracy. Mr. Tyrrel would not perhaps have so easily given up his point, had not his own good sense presently taught him that, however eager he might be for revenge, this was not the ground he should desire to occupy. Add to this, that unaccustomed as he was to strenuous opposition, he was less prepared instantaneously to encounter it; and indeed there was something in Mr. Falkland's manner that ex∣torted assent for the present, however prejudice might reassume its dominion. But, though Mr. Tyrrel could not openly resent this rebellion against his authority, he brooded over it in the recesses of a malignant mind; and it was evident enough that he was accumulating materials for a bitter account, to which he trusted that his adversary should one day be brought.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>THIS was only one out of innumerable in∣stances that every day seemed to enlarge, of petty mortifications which Mr. Tyrrel was destined to endure on the part of Mr. Falkland. In every one of them Mr. Falkland conducted himself with such propriety and unaffected mildness, as perpetually to make some addition to the stock of his reputation. The more Mr. Tyrrel struggled with his misfortune, the more conspicuous and in∣veterate it became. A thousand times he cursed his stars, which took, as he apprehended, a mali∣cious pleasure in making Mr. Falkland at every turn the instrument of his humiliation. Smarting as he was under a succession of untoward events, he appeared to feel in the most exquisite manner the distinctions paid to his adversary, even in those particulars to which he had not the slightest pre∣tensions. An instance of this speedily occurred.</P>
<P>Mr. Clare, a poet whose works have done im∣mortal honour to the country that produced him, had lately retired, after a life spent in the sublimest e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>orts of genius, to enjoy the produce of his economy and the reputation he had acquired, in this very neighbourhood. Such an inmate was looked up to by the country gentlemen with a de∣gree of adoration. They felt a conscious pride in recollecting that the boast of England was a native of their vicinity, and they were by no means defi∣cient in gratitude to him, when they saw him who had left them an adventurer, return into the midst of them in the close of his days crowned with ho∣nours
<PB N="31" REF="028752_0033_0FDEB45C94F87050"/>
and opulence. The reader is acquainted with his works; he has probably dwelt upon them with transport: and I need not remind him of their excellence. But he is perhaps a stranger to his personal qualifications. He does not know that his productions were scarcely more admirable than his conversation. In company he seemed to be the only person ignorant of the greatness of his fame. To the world his writings will long remain a kind of specimen of what the human mind is capable of performing; but no man perceived their defects so acutely as he, or saw so distinctly how much yet remained to be effected. He alone appeared to look upon his works with superiority and in∣difference. One of the features that most emi∣nently distinguished him was a perpetual suavity of manners, a comprehensiveness of mind, that re∣garded the errors of others without a particle of resentment, and made it impossible for any one to be his enemy. He pointed out to men their mis∣takes with frankness and unreserve: his remon∣strances produced astonishment and conviction, but without uneasiness to the party to whom they were addressed: they felt the instrument that was em∣ployed to correct their irregularities, but it never mangled what it was intended to heal. Such were the moral qualities that distinguished him among his acquaintance. The intellectual accomplish∣ments he exhibited were principally a tranquil and mild enthusiasm, and a richness of conception that dictated spontaneously to his tongue, and flowed with so much ease, that it was only by retrospect you could be made aware of the amazing variety of ideas that had been presented.</P>
<P>Mr. Clare certainly found few men in this re∣mote situation that were capable of participating in his ideas and amusements. It has not seldom been the weakness of great men to fly to solitude,
<PB N="32" REF="028752_0034_0FDBEF76DA07F0C0"/>
and converse with woods and groves, rather than with a circle of strong and comprehensive minds like their own. From the moment of Mr. Falk∣land's arrival in the neighbourhood Mr. Clare dis∣tinguished him in the most flattering manner. To so penetrating a genius there was no need of long experience and patient observation to discover the merits and defects of any character that presented itself. The foundations of his judgment had long since been accumulated, and at the close of so il∣lustrious a life he might almost be said to see through nature at a glance. What wonder that he took some interest in a mind in a certain degree congenial with his own? But to Mr. Tyrrel's diseased imagination every distinction bestowed on another seemed to be expressly intended as an insult to him. On the other hand Mr. Clare, though gentle and benevolent in his remonstrances to a degree that made the taking of offence impossible, was by no means parsimonious of praise, or slow to make use of the deference that was paid him, for the purpose of doing justice to merit. The pain which Mr. Tyrrel endured from this circum∣stance in the present instance was extreme.</P>
<P>It happened at one of those public meetings at which Mr. Falkland and Mr. Tyrrel were present, that the conversation, in one of the most numerous knots into which the company was broken, turned upon the poetical talents of the former. A lady, who was present, and was distinguished for the acuteness of her understanding, said, she had been favoured with the sight of a poem he had just written, entitled, an Ode to the Genius of Chivalry, which appeared to her of exquisite merit. The curiosity of the company was immediately excited, and the lady added, she had a copy in her pocket, which would be very much at their service, provided its being thus produced would not be dis∣agreeable
<PB N="33" REF="028752_0035_0FDEB463A3345828"/>
to the author. The whole circle imme∣diately intreated Mr. Falkland to comply with their wishes, and Mr. Clare, who was one of the com∣pany, inforced their petition. Nothing gave this gentleman so much pleasure as to have an oppor∣tunity of witnessing and doing justice to the exhi∣bition of intellectual excellence. Mr. Falkland had no false modesty or affectation, and therefore readily yielded his consent. If their kindness led them to expect too much, the loss, he said, was theirs. What he ought most to desire was to be set right, and he hoped he had fortitude enough tranquilly to abide the verdict of justice.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel accidentally sat at the extremity of this circle. It cannot be supposed that the turn the conversation had taken was by any means agree∣able to him. He seemed to wish to withdraw him∣self, but there was some unknown power that as it were by enchantment retained him in his place, and made him consent to drink to the dregs the bitter potion which envy had prepared from him.</P>
<P>The poem was read to the rest of the company by Mr. Clare, whose elocution was scarcely inferior to his other accomplishments. Simplicity, discri∣mination and energy constantly attended him in the act of reading, and it is not easy to conceive a more refined delight than fell to the lot of those who had the good fortune to be his auditors. The beauties of Mr. Falkland's poem were accordingly exhibited with every advantage. The successive passions of the author were communicated to the reader. Every word was impressed with its true value, and none was brought forward with dispro∣portioned and elaborate emphasis. The pictures conjured up by the creative <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ancy of the poet were placed full to view, at one time overwhelming the soul with superstitious awe, at another transporting it with luxuriant beauty.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="028752_0036_0FDBEF785F244E28"/>
The character of the hearers upon this occasion has already been described. They were for the most part plain, unlettered, and of little refine∣ment. Poetry in general they read, when read at all, from the mere force of imitation and with few sensations of pleasure; but this poem had a pecu∣liar vein of glowing inspiration. This very poem would probably have been seen by many of them with little effect; but the rhetoric of Mr. Clare carried it home to the heart. He ended; and, as the countenances of his auditors had before gone along with the passions of the composition, so now they emulated each other in giving language to their approbation. They were surprised into a sort of applause to which they were little accustomed. One spoke and another followed by a sort of un∣controulable impulse; and the rude and broken manner of their commendations rendered them the more singular and remarkable. But what was least to be endured was the behaviour of Mr. Clare. He returned the manuscript to the lady from whom he had received it, and then turning to Mr. Falk∣land said with emphasis and animation: Why, this is well, sir. It is of the right stamp; none of your hard essays strained from the ninefold labour of a pedant, or of your pastoral ditties most dis∣mally distressed in search of a meaning. We want such people as you. But remember, young man, the muse was not given to add new refinements to idleness, but for the deliverance of the world.</P>
<P>A moment after Mr. Clare had thus express∣ed himself, he quitted his seat, and with Mr. Falkland and two or three more withdrew. As soon as they were gone, Mr. Tyrrel edged farther into the circle. He had sat silent so long that he seemed ready to burst with gall and indignation. Mighty pretty verses, said he, half talking to him∣self, and not addressing any particular person:
<PB N="35" REF="028752_0037_0FDEB46651545338"/>
why, aye, the verses were well enough. Damna∣tion! I should like to know what a ship-load of such stuff is good for.</P>
<P>Why, surely, said the lady who had introduced Mr. Falkland's ode on the present occasion, you must allow that poetry is a very agreeable and ele∣gant amusement.</P>
<P>Elegant, quotha!—Why, look at this Falkland! A puny bit of a thing! In the devil's name, ma∣dam, do you think he would write poetry if he could do any thing better?</P>
<P>The conversation did not stop here. The lady expostulated. Several other persons, fresh from the sensation they had felt, put in their share. Mr. Tyrrel grew more violent in his invectives, and found ease in uttering them. The persons who were able in any degree to check his vehemence were withdrawn. One speaker after another shrunk back into silence, too timid to oppose, or too indo∣lent to contend with the fierceness of his passion. He found the appearance of his old ascendancy; but he felt its deceitfulness and uncertainty, and was gloomily dissatisfied.</P>
<P>In his return from this assembly he was accom∣panied by a young man whom similitude of man∣ners had rendered one of his principal confidents, and whose road home was in part the same as his own. One would have thought that Mr. Tyrrel had sufficiently vented his spleen in the dialogue he had just been holding with the lady and her asso∣ciates. But he was unable to dismiss from his re∣collection the anguish he had endured. Damn Falkland! said he. What a pitiful scoundrel is here to make all this bustle about! But women and fools always will be fools; there is no help for that! Those that set them on have most to answer for; and most of all Mr. Clare. He is a man that ought to know something of the world, and past
<PB N="36" REF="028752_0038_0FDBEF804E6E88C8"/>
being duped by gewgaws and tinsel. He seemed too to have some sense of justice: I should not have suspected him of hallooing to a cry of mongrels without honesty or reason. But the world is all alike. Those that seem better than their neigh∣bours are only more artful. They mean the same thing, though they take a different road. He de∣ceived me for a while, but it is all out now. They are the makers of all the mischief. Fools might blunder, but they would not persist, if people that ought to set them right, did not encourage them to go wrong.</P>
<P>A few days after this adventure Mr. Tyrrel was surprised to receive a visit from Mr. Falkland. It was the first that had ever passed, they having never before seen each other but at a third place. Mr. Falkland proceeded without ceremony to explain the motive of his coming.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel, said he, I am come to have an ami∣cable explanation with you.</P>
<P>Explanation! What is my offence?</P>
<P>None in the world, sir; and for that reason I conceive this the fittest time for us to come to a right understanding.</P>
<P>You are in the devil of a hurry, sir. Are you clear that this haste will not mar, instead of make an understanding?</P>
<P>I think I am, sir. I have great faith in the pu∣rity of my intentions, and I will not doubt that, when you perceive the view with which I come, you will willingly co-operate with it.</P>
<P>Mayhap, Mr. Falkland, we may not agree about that. One man thinks one way, and another man thinks another. Mayhap I do not think I have any great reason to be pleased with you already.</P>
<P>It may be so. I cannot however charge myself with having giving you reason to be displeased.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="028752_0039_0FDEB467D6757B30"/>
Mr. Tyrrel, proceeded Mr. Falkland, you will readily imagine that the cause that brought me hi∣ther was not a slight one. I would not have trou∣bled you with a visit but for important reasons. My coming is a pledge how deeply I am myself impressed with what I have to communicate.</P>
<P>We are in a critical situation. We are upon the brink of a whirlpool which, if once it get hold of us, will render all farther deliberation impotent. Shall we be enemies? What benefit will be derived from that? Who ever found in gall, malice, sus∣picion and hatred the materials of happiness? No; to the breast where they enter, happiness is for ever a stranger. They haunt our relaxations, they poison our pleasures, they hardly allow us a mo∣ment of unmixed satisfaction. A brow of care, a cankered heart, a bosom bursting with rage, these are their retinue.—If we be enemies, who shall tell where our enmity shall stop? Every new event will feed it; it will swell beyond imagination or li∣mit; ever seeming enlarged to its utmost size, it will still become more monstrous, more intolerable!</P>
<P>Upon my soul, you are an extraordinary man,—an impertinent man! Why intrude upon me your prophecies and forebodings?</P>
<P>Because it is necessary to your happiness. Be∣cause it becomes me to tell you of our danger now, rather than wait till my character will permit me to be silent no longer.</P>
<P>Sir, I mean to take care of my own happiness. I do not thank you for your interference. Damn me, if I think this is any thing else but a trick to put a new feather in your cap at your neighbour's expence.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel, it is to provide against such miscon∣structions on either part that I have sought you. I know the infirmity of my temper, but at least upon this occasion I am determined not to take any
<PB N="38" REF="028752_0040_0FDBEF815B345B00"/>
thing ill. If my intention had been to outshine you, should I have come alone?</P>
<P>Well, sir, you have no right to put me out of humour with myself. If you come to play upon me, and try what sort of a fellow you shall have to deal with, damn me, if you shall have any rea∣son to hug yourself upon the experiment.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel, nothing is more easy for us than to quarrel. If you desire that, there is no fear that you will find opportunities.</P>
<P>Damn me, sir, if I do not believe you are come to bully me.</P>
<P>Good God, Mr. Tyrrel, be less unjust! My character is too well known to allow it to be sup∣posed that I fear any man, and I do not in the least suspect you of a weakness in that respect to which I am myself a stranger.</P>
<P>Well, sir, that is thereafter as it may be.</P>
<P>By quarrelling we shall but imitate the great mass of mankind who could easily quarrel in our place. Let us do better. Let us show that we have the wisdom to avoid vulgar errors, and the magnani∣mity to condemn petty misunderstandings. We are formed in different habits; why should we in∣terfere? The world is wide enough for both. By thus judging we shall do ourselves most substantial honour. By a contrary conduct we shall be our∣selves the sufferers, and merely present a comedy for the amusement of our acquaintance.</P>
<P>Do you think so? There may be something in that. Damn me, if I consent to be the jest of any man living.</P>
<P>You are right, Mr. Tyrrel. Let us each act in the manner best calculated to excite respect. We neither of us wish to change roads with the other; let us each suffer the other to pursue his own track unmolested. Be this our compact; and by mutual forbearance let us preserve mutual peace.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="028752_0041_0FDEB46A28F7BF48"/>
Saying this, Mr. Falkland put out his hand in token of fellowship. But the gesture was too significant. The wayward Tyrrel, who seemed to have been somewhat impressed by what had pre∣ceded, taken as he was now by surprise, shrunk back.</P>
<P>All this is very unaccountable, cried he. What the devil can have made you so forward, if you had not some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly purpose to answer by which I am to be overreached?</P>
<P>My purpose, replied Mr. Falkland, is a manly and an honest purpose. Why should you refuse a proposition dictated by reason, and an equal re∣gard to the interest of each?—Mr. Tyrrel had had an opportunity for pause, and fell back into his habitual character.</P>
<P>Well, sir, in all this I must own there is some frankness. Now I will return you like for like. It is no matter how I came by it, my temper is rough, and will not be controuled. Mayhap you may think it a weakness, but I do not desire to see it altered. Till you came, I found myself very well: I liked my neighbours, and my neighbours hu∣moured me. But now the case is entirely alter∣ed; and, as long as I cannot stir abroad without meeting with some mortification in which you are directly or remotely concerned, I am determined to hate you. Now, sir, if you will only go out of the county or the kingdom, to the devil if you please, so as I may never hear of you any more, I will promise never to quarrel with you as long as I live. Your poetry and your delicacy, your quirks and your conundrums may then be the very paragon of excellence for what I care.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel, attend to reason. I might as well desire you to leave the county, as you desire me. I came here to you, not as to a master, but an equal. In the society of men we must have some∣thing
<PB N="40" REF="028752_0042_0FDBEF865EF811F0"/>
to bear, as well as to perform. No man must think that the world was made for him alone. Let us then take things as we find them; and ac∣commodate ourselves with prudence to unavoid∣able circumstances.</P>
<P>True, sir, all that is very fine talking. But I return to my text; we are as God made us. I am neither a philosopher nor a poet, to set out upon a wild-goose chase of making myself a different man from what you find me. As for conse∣quences, what must be must be. As we brew, we must bake. And so, do you see, I shall not trouble myself about what is to be, but stand up to it with a stout heart when it comes. Only this I can tell you, that, as long as I find you thrust into my dish every day, I shall hate you as bad as senna and valerian. And damn me, if I do not think I hate you the more for coming to-day in this prag∣matical way when nobody sent for you, on purpose to show how much wiser you are than all the world besides.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel, I have done. I foresaw conse∣quences, and came as a friend to advise you. I did hope that by mutual explanation we should each of us have improved in the good opinion of the other. I am partly disappointed; but I still believe that when you coolly reflect on what has passed, you will give me credit for the honesty of my intentions, and be disposed to think of me with the same consideration and liberality as I am determined to exercise towards you.</P>
<P>Having said this, Mr. Falkland departed; and Mr. Tyrrel had recourse to his old friend, to whom he unburthened the tumult of his thoughts. This, cried he, is a new artifice of the fellow to prove his imagined superiority. We know very well that he has the gift of the gab. To be sure, if the world were to be governed by words, he would
<PB N="41" REF="028752_0043_0FDEB47108758AE8"/>
be in the right box. Oh, yes, he had it all hollow before him! But what signifies prating? Business must be done in an other-guess way than that. I wonder what possessed me that I did not kick him! But that is all to come. This is only a new debt added to the score which he shall one day richly pay. This Falkland haunts me like a demon. I cannot wake, but I think of him. I cannot sleep, but I see him. He poisons all my pleasures. I should be glad to see him torn with tenter-hooks, and to grind his heart-strings with my teeth. I shall know no joy, till I see him ruined. There may be some things right about him; but he is my perpetual torment. The thought of him presses like a dead weight upon my heart, and I have a right to throw it off. Does he think I will feel all that I endure for nothing?</P>
<P>In spite of the acerbity of Mr. Tyrrel's feelings, it is probable however he did some justice to his rival. Upon ordinary occasions at least he seemed disposed to treat him with an involuntary defe∣rence. He was no longer equally voluble in mixed companies in his abuse of him; a part of the topics of his invective seemed to be gone. He was no longer eager to treat him with random hostility; if he regarded him with equal dislike, he at least appeared to regard him as a formidable foe. He avoided his encounter; he forbore to contradict his opinions; he seemed to lie in wait for his victim, and to collect his venom for a mortal assault.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<P>IT was not long after that a malignant contagious distemper broke out in the neighbour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ood, which proved fatal to many of the inhabitants, and was of unexampled rapidity in its effects. One of the first persons that was seized with it was Mr. Clare. It may be believed that this incident spread grief and alarm through the vicinity. Mr. Clare was considered by them as something more than a mor∣tal. The equanimity of his behaviour, his un∣assuming carriage, his exuberant benevolence and goodness of heart, joined with his talents, his inoffensive wit, and the comprehensiveness of his intelligence made him the idol of all that knew him. In the scene of his rural retreat at least he had not an enemy. All mourned the danger that now threatened him. He appeared to have the prospect of long life, and of going down to his grave full of years and of honour. Perhaps these appearances were deceitful. Perhaps the intel∣lectual efforts he had exerted, which were occa∣sionally more sudden, violent and unintermitted than a strict regard to health would have dictated, had laid the seeds of future disease. But a san∣guine observer would infallibly have predicted, that his good sense, presence of mind and unaltered chearfulness would be able even to keep death at bay for a time and baffle the attacks of distemper, provided this universal foe did not take him by sur∣prise. The general affliction therefore was doubly pungent upon the present occasion.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="028752_0045_0FDEB473CECDBFC8"/>
But no one was so much affected as Mr. Falk∣land. Perhaps no man living so well understood the value of the life that was now at stake. He immediately hastened to the spot; but he found some difficulty in gaining admission. Mr. Clare, aware of the infectious nature of his disease, had given directions that as few people as possible should approach him. Mr. Falkland sent up his name. He was told that he was included in the general orders. He was not however of a temper to be easily repulsed; he persisted with obstinacy, and at length carried his point, being only reminded in the first instance to employ those precautions which experience has approved as most effectual for coun∣teracting infection.</P>
<P>He found Mr. Clare in his bedchamber, but not in bed. He was sitting in his night-gown at a bureau near the window. His appearance was composed and chearful, but death was in his coun∣tenance. I had a great inclination, Mr. Falkland, said he, not to have suffered you to come in; and yet there is not a person in the world it could give me more pleasure to see. But upon second thoughts I believe there are few people that could run into a danger of this kind with a better prospect of escaping. In your case, at least the garrison will not be taken through the treachery of the com∣mander. I cannot tell how it is that I, who can preach wisdom to you, have myself been caught. But do not be discouraged by my example. I had no notice of my danger, or I would have acquitted myself better. These strange seeds of distemper seem to float in the air, and to fasten upon the frame without its being possible for us to tell what was the method of their approach.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland, having once established himself in the apartment of his friend, would upon no terms consent to retire. Mr. Clare considered that there
<PB N="44" REF="028752_0046_0FDBEF8D3174B888"/>
was perhaps less danger in this choice than in a frequent change from the extremes of a pure to a tainted air, and desisted from his expostulation. Falkland, said he, when you came in, I had just finished making my will. I was not pleased with what I had formerly drawn up upon that subject, and I did not choose in my present situation to call in an attorney. In fact it would be strange if a man of sense with pure and direct intentions should not be able to perform such a function for him∣self.</P>
<P>Mr. Clare continued to act in the same easy and disengaged manner as in perfect health. To judge from the chearfulness of his tone and the firmness of his manner, the thought would never once have occurred to you that he was dying. He walked, he reasoned, he jested, in a way that argued the most perfect self-possession. But his appearance changed perceptibly for the worse every quarter of an hour. Mr. Falkland kept his eye perpetually fixed upon him with mingled sentiments of anxiety and admiration.</P>
<P>Falkland, said he, after having appeared for a short period absorbed in thought, I feel that I am dying. This is a strange distemper of mine. Yes∣terday I seemed in perfect health, and to-morrow I shall be an insensible corpse. How curious is the line that separates life and death to mortal men! To be at one moment active, gay, penetrating, with immense stores of knowledge at one's com∣mand, capable of delighting, instructing and ani∣mating mankind, and the next, lifeless and loath∣some, an incumbrance upon the face of the earth. Such is the history of many men, and such will be mine.</P>
<P>I feel as if I had yet much to do in the world; but it will not be. I must be contented with what is past. It is in vain that I muster all my spirits to
<PB N="45" REF="028752_0047_0FDEB475567FB848"/>
my heart. The enemy is too mighty and too mer∣ciless for me; he will not give me time so much as to breathe. These things are not yet in our power. They are parts of a great series that is perpetually flowing. The general welfare, the great business of the universe, will go on, though I bear no far∣ther share in promoting it. That task is reserved for younger strengths, for you, Falkland, and such as you. We should be contemptible indeed, if the prospect of human improvement did not yield us a pure and perfect delight, independently of the question of our existing to partake of it. Man∣kind would have little to envy to future ages, if they had all enjoyed a serenity as perfect as mine.</P>
<P>Mr. Clare sat up through the whole day, indulg∣ing himself in easy and chearful exertions, which were perhaps better calculated to refresh and invi∣gorate the frame, than if he had sought repose in its direct form. Now and then he was visited with a sudden pang; but it was no sooner felt, than he seemed to rise above it, and smiled at the impo∣tence of the attack. Three or four times he was bedewed with profuse sweats, and these again were succeeded by an extreme dryness and burning heat of the skin. He was next covered with small livid spots. Symptoms of shivering followed, but these he drove away with a determined resolution. He then became tranquil and composed, and after some time determined to go to bed, it being al∣ready night. Falkland, said he, pressing his hand, the task of dying is not so difficult, as some people imagine. When one looks back from the brink of it, one wonders that so total a subversion can take place at so easy a rate.</P>
<P>He had now been some time in bed, and, as every thing was still, Mr. Falkland hoped that he slept. But in that he was mistaken. Presently Mr. Clare threw back the curtain, and looked in
<PB N="46" REF="028752_0048_0FDBEF8E172DE238"/>
the countenance of his friend. I cannot sleep, said he. No, if I could sleep, it would be the same thing as to recover; and I am fated to have the worst in this battle.</P>
<P>Falkland, I have been thinking about you. I do not know any one whose future usefulness I con∣template with greater hope. Take care of your∣self. Do not let the world be defrauded of the benefit of your virtues. I am well acquainted with your weakness as well as your strength. You have an impetuosity and an impatience of imagined dishonour, that, if once set wrong, may make you as eminently mischievous, as you will otherwise be useful. Would to God you would think seriously of exterminating this error!</P>
<P>But, if I cannot, in the brief expostulation my present situation will allow, work this desirable change in you, there is at least one thing I can do. I can put you upon your guard against a mischief I foresee to be imminent. Beware of Mr. Tyrrel. Do not commit the mistake of despising him as an unequal opponent. Petty causes may produce great mischiefs. Mr. Tyrrel is boisterous, rugged and unfeeling; and you are too passionate, too acutely sensible of injury. It would be truly to be lamented, if a man so inferior, so utterly unwor∣thy to be compared with you, should be capable of changing your whole history into misery and guilt. Think of this. I exact no promise from you. I would not shackle you with the fetters of super∣stition; I would have you be governed by reason and justice.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland was deeply affected with this ex∣postulation. His sense of the generous attention of Mr. Clare at such a moment as this, was so great as almost to deprive him of utterance. He spoke in short sentences and with visible effort. I will behave better, replied he. Never fear me! Your
<PB N="47" REF="028752_0049_0FDBEFD25A458660"/>
kind admonitions shall not be thrown away upon me.</P>
<P>Mr. Clare adverted to another subject. I have made you my executor; you will not refuse me this last office of friendship. It is but a short time that I have had the happiness of knowing you; but in that short time I have examined you well, and seen you thoroughly. Do not disappoint the sanguine hope I have entertained!</P>
<P>I have left some legacies. My former connec∣tions, while I lived amidst the busy haunts of men, as many of them as were intimate, are all of them dear to me. I have not had time to summon them about me upon the present occasion, nor did I de∣sire it. The remembrances of me will, I hope, answer a better purpose than such as are usually thought of on similar occasions.</P>
<P>Mr. Clare, having thus unburthened his mind, spoke no more for several hours. Towards morn∣ing Mr. Falkland quietly withdrew the curtain, and looked at the dying man. His eyes were open, and were now gently turned towards his young friend. His countenance was sunk, and of a death∣like appearance. I hope you are better, said Falk∣land in a half-whisper, as if afraid of disturbing him. Mr. Clare drew his hand from the bed∣clothes, and stretched it forward; Mr. Falkland advanced, and took hold of it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Much better, said Mr. Clare in a voice, inward and hardly articulate: the struggle is now over; I have finished my part: farewel; remember! These were his last words. He lived still a few hours; his lips were sometimes seen to move; he expired without a groan</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland had witnessed the scene with much anxiety. His hopes of a favourable crisis, and his fear of disturbing the last moments of his friend, had held him dumb. For the last half hour he had stood up with his eyes intently fixed upon Mr.
<PB N="48" REF="028752_0050_0FDBEF9366046430"/>
Clare. He witnessed the last gasp, the last little convulsive motion of the frame. He continued to look; he seemed sometimes to imagine that he saw life renewed. At length he could deceive himself no longer, and exclaimed with a distracted accent, And is this all? He would have thrown himself upon the body of his friend; the attendants with∣held, and would have forced him into another apartment. But he struggled from them, and hung fondly over the bed. Is this the end of genius, virtue and excellence? Is the luminary of the world thus for ever gone? Oh, yesterday! yester∣day! Clare, why could not I have died in your stead? Dreadful moment! Irreparable loss! Lost in the very maturity and vigour of his mind! Cut off from a usefulness ten thousand times greater than any he had already exhibited! Oh, his was a mind to have instructed sages, and guided the moral world! This is all we have left of him! The eloquence of those lips is gone! The incessant activity of that heart is still! The best and wisest of men is gone, and the world is insensible of its loss!</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel heard the intelligence of Mr. Clare's death with emotion, but of a very different kind. He avowed that he had not forgiven him his partial attachment to Falkland, and therefore could not recal his remembrance with kindness. But, if he could have overlooked his past injustice, sufficient care was taken to employ means to keep alive his resentment. Falkland forsooth attended him on his death-bed, as if nobody else was worthy to par∣take of his confidential communications. But what was worst of all was this executorship. In every thing this pragmatical rascal throws me behind. Contemptible wretch, that has nothing of the man about him! Must he perpetually trample on his betters? Is every body incapable of reason, and
<PB N="49" REF="028752_0051_0FDBEFD40F9B4CE0"/>
making a right estimate of the merits of men? caught with mere outside? choosing the flimsy be∣fore the substantial? And upon his death-bed too! [Mr. Tyrrel with his uncultivated brutality mixed, as usually happens, certain rude notions of reli∣gion.] Sure the sense of his situation might have shamed him. Poor wretch! his soul has a great deal to answer for. He has made my pillow un∣easy; and whatever may be the consequences, it is him we have to thank for them.</P>
<P>The death of Mr. Clare removed the person who could most effectually have moderated the animosi∣ties of the contending parties, and took away the great operative check upon the excesses of Mr. Tyrrel. This rustic tyrant had been held in invo∣luntary restraint by the intellectual ascendancy of his celebrated neighbour; and, notwithstanding the general ferocity of his temper, did not appear till lately to have entertained a hatred against him. In the short time that had elapsed from the period in which Mr. Clare had fixed his residence in the neighbourhood to that of the arrival of Mr. Falk∣land from the Continent, the conduct of Mr. Tyrrel had even shown certain tokens of improvement. Such was the felicity of Mr. Clare's manners that, even while he corrected, he conciliated, and ex∣cited no angry emotions in those whose actions were most curbed by the apprehension of his dis∣pleasure. The effects of his suavity however, so far as related to Mr. Tyrrel, had been in a certain degree suspended by considerations of rivalship be∣tween this gentleman and Mr. Falkland. And, now that the influence of Mr. Clare's presence and virtues were entirely removed, Mr. Tyrrel's temper broke out into more criminal excesses than at any former period, having the additional stimulus of mortified pride and disappointed ambition.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<P>THE consequences of all this speedily manifest∣ed themselves. The very next incident in the story was in some degree decisive of the catastrophe. Hitherto I have spoken only of preliminary matters, seemingly unconnected with each other, though leading to that state of mind in both parties, which had such fatal effects. But all that remains is ra∣pid and tremendous. The death-dealing mischief advances with an accelerated motion, appearing to defy human wisdom and human strength to ob∣struct its operation.</P>
<P>There was a tenant of Mr. Tyrrel, one Hawk∣ins;—I cannot mention his name without recol∣lecting the painful tragedies that are annexed to it! This Hawkins had originally been taken up by Mr. Tyrrel with a view of protecting him from the arbitrary proceedings of a neighbouring squire, though he had now in his turn become an object of persecution to Mr. Tyrrel himself. The first ground of their connection was this. Hawkins, beside a farm which he rented under the above∣mentioned squire, had a small freehold estate that he inherited from his father. This of course en∣titled him to a vote in the county elections; and, a warmly contested election having occurred, he was required by his landlord to vote for the candi∣date in whose favour he had himself engaged. Hawkins refused to obey the mandate, and soon after received notice to quit the farm he at that time rented.</P>
<P>It happened that Mr. Tyrrel had interested him∣self strongly in behalf of the opposite candidate;
<PB N="51" REF="028752_0053_0FDBEFD75FEB5B30"/>
and, as Mr. Tyrrel's estate bordered upon the seat of Hawkins's residence, the ejected countryman could think of no better expedient than that of riding over to this gentleman's mansion, and re∣lating the case to him. Mr. Tyrrel heard him through with attention. Well, friend, said he, it is very true that I wished Mr. Jackman to carry his election; but you know it is usual in these cases for tenants to vote just as their landlords please. I do not think proper to encourage rebellion.—All that is very right, and please you, replied Hawkins; and I would have voted at my landlord's bidding for any other man in the three kingdoms but squire Marlow. You must know one day his huntsman rode over my fence, and so through my best field of standing corn. It was not above a dozen yards about, if he had kept the cart-road. The fellow had served me the same sauce, an it please your honour, three or four times before. So I only asked him, What he did that for, and whether he had not more conscience than to spoil people's crops a' that fashion? Presently the squire came up. He is but a poor, weazen-face chicken of a gentleman, saving your honour's reverence. And so he flew into a woundy passion, and threatened to horsewhip me. I will do as much in reason to pleasure my landlord as arr a tenant he has; but I will not give my vote to a man that threatens to horsewhip me. And so, your honour, I and my wife and three children are to be turned out of house and home, and what I am to do to maintain them God knows. I have been a hard-working man, and have always lived very well, and I do think the case is main hard. Squire Underwood turns me out of my farm; and, if your honour do not take me in, I know none of the neighbour∣ing gentry will, for fear as they say of encouraging their own tenants to run rusty too.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="028752_0054_0FDBEF9A14C69E68"/>
This representation was not without its effect upon Mr. Tyrrel. Well, well, man, replied he, we will see what can be done. Order and subor∣dination are very good things; but people should know how much to require. As you tell the story, I cannot see that you are greatly to blame. Marlow is a coxcombical prig, that is the truth on't; and, if a man will expose himself, why, he must even take what follows. I do hate a Frenchified fop with all my soul; and I cannot say that I am much pleased with Mr. Underwood for taking the part of such a rascal. Hawkins, I think is your name? You may call on Barnes, my steward, to-morrow, and he shall speak to you.</P>
<P>While Mr. Tyrrel was speaking, he recollected that he had a farm vacant of nearly the same va∣lue as that which Hawkins at present rented under Mr. Underwood. He immediately consulted his steward, and, finding the thing suitable in every respect, Hawkins was admitted out of hand into the catalogue of Mr. Tyrrel's tenants. Mr. Un∣derwood extremely resented this proceeding, which indeed, as being contrary to the understood con∣ventions of the country gentlemen, few people but Mr. Tyrrel would have ventured upon. He said that there was an end to all regulation, if tenants were to be encouraged in such inexcusable disobe∣dience. It was not a question of this or that can∣didate, seeing that any gentleman, who was a true friend to his country, would rather lose his elec∣tion, than do a thing which if once established into a practice, would deprive them for ever of the power of managing any election. The labouring people were sturdy and resolute enough of their own accord; it became every day mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> difficult to keep them under any subordinations and, if the gentlemen were so ill-advised as to neglect the pub∣lic
<PB N="53" REF="028752_0055_0FDBEFD859B782E8"/>
good, and encourage them in their insolence, there was no foreseeing where it would end.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel was not of a stamp to be influenced by these remonstrances. Their general spirit was sufficiently conformable to the sentiments he him∣self entertained; but he was of too vehement a temper to maintain the character of a consistent politician; and, however wrong his conduct might be, he would by no means admit of its being set right by the suggestions of others. The more his patronage of Hawkins was criticised, the more in∣flexibly he adhered to it; and he was at no loss in clubs and other assemblies to overbear and silence, if not to confute his censurers. Beside which, Hawkins had certain accomplishments which qua∣lified him to be a favourite with Mr. Tyrrel. The bluntness of his manner and the ruggedness of his temper gave him some resemblance to his landlord; and, as these qualities were likely to be more fre∣quently exercised on such persons as had incurred Mr. Tyrrel's displeasure than upon Mr. Tyrrel him∣self, they were not observed without some degree of complacency. In a word, he every day receiv∣ed new marks of distinction from his patron, and after some time was appointed coadjutor to Mr. Barnes in the capacity of bailiff. It was about the same period that he obtained a lease of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arm of which he was tenant.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel was determined, as occasion offered, to promote every part of the family of this favour∣ed dependent. Hawkins had a son, a lad of se∣venteen, of a very agreeable person, a ruddy com∣plexion, and of quick and lively parts. This lad was in an uncommon degree the favourite of his father, who seemed to have nothing so much at heart as the future welfare of his son. Mr. Tyrrel had noticed him two or three times with approba∣tion; and the boy, being fond of the sports of the
<PB N="54" REF="028752_0056_0FDBEF9EC2123278"/>
field, had occasionally followed the hounds, and displayed various instances both of agility and saga∣city in presence of the squire. One day in parti∣cular he exhibited himself with uncommon advan∣tage; and Mr. Tyrrel without farther delay propo∣sed to his father to take him into his family, and make him whipper-in to his hounds, till he could provide him with some more lucrative appointment in his service.</P>
<P>This proposal was received by Hawkins with various marks of mortification. He excused him∣self with hesitation for not accepting the offered favour; said the lad was in many ways useful to him; and hoped his honour would not insist upon depriving him of his assistance. This apology might perhaps have been sufficient with any other man than Mr. Tyrrel; but it was frequently observ∣ed of this gentleman that, when he had once form∣ed a determination however slight in favour of any measure, he was never afterwards known to give it up, and that the only effect of opposition was to make him eager and inflexible in pursuit of that to which he had before been nearly indifferent. At first he seemed to receive the apology of Hawkins with good humour, and to see nothing in it but what was reasonable; but afterwards every time he saw the boy his desire of retaining him in his service was increased, and he more than once re∣peated to his father the good disposition in which he felt himself towards him. At length he observ∣ed that the lad was no more to be seen mingling in his favourite sports, and he began to suspect that this originated in a determination to thwart him in his projects.</P>
<P>Roused by this suspicion, which was not of a nature with Mr. Tyrrel to brook a delay, he sent for Hawkins to confer with him. Hawkins, said he, in a tone of displeasure, I am not satisfied with
<PB N="55" REF="028752_0057_0FDBEFD9D2D37928"/>
you. I have spoken to you two or three times about this lad of yours, whom I am desirous of taking into favour. What is the reason, sir, that you seem unthankful and averse to my kindness? You ought to know that I am not to be trifled with. I shall not be contented, when I offer my favours to have them rejected by such fellows as you. I made you what you are; and, if I please, can make you more helpless and miserable than you were when I found you. Have a care!</P>
<P>An it please your honour, said Hawkins, you have been a very good master to me, and I will tell you the whole truth. I hope you will na be angry. This lad is my favourite, my comfort and the stay of my age.</P>
<P>Well, and what then? Is that a reason you should hinder his preferment?</P>
<P>Nay, pray your honour, hear me. I may be very weak for aught I know in this case, but I cannot help it. My father was a clergyman. We have all of us lived in a creditable way; and I cannot bear to think that this poor lad of mine should go to service. For my part, I do not see any good that comes of servants. God forgive me, if I am unjust! But this is a very dear case, and I cannot bear to risk my poor boy's welfare, when I can so easily, if you please, keep him out of harm's way. At present he is sober and indus∣trious, and, without being conceited or surly, knows what is due to him. I know, your honour, that it is main foolish of me to talk to you thus; but your honour has been a good master to me, and I cannot bear to tell you a lie.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel had heard the whole of this harangue in silence, because he was too much astonished to open his mouth. If a thunderbolt had fallen un∣expectedly at his feet, he could not have testified greater surprise. He had thought that Hawkins
<PB N="56" REF="028752_0058_0FDBEFA0160F7218"/>
was so foolishly fond of his son that he could not bear to trust him out of his presence, but had never in the slightest degree suspected what he now found to be the truth.</P>
<P>Oh, oh, you are a gentleman, are you? A pretty gentleman truly! Your father was a cler∣gyman! Your family is too good to enter into my service! Why, you impudent rascal! was it for this that I took you up, when Mr. Underwood dismissed you for your insolence to him? Have I been nursing a viper in my bosom? Pretty mas∣ter's manners will be contaminated truly! He will not know what is due to him, but will be ac∣customed to obey orders! You insufferable vil∣lain! Get out of my sight! Depend upon it, I will have no gentlemen on my estate! I will off with them, root and branch, bag and baggage! So, do you hear, sir? come to me to-morrow morning, bring your son, and ask my pardon; or take my word for it, I will make you so miserable, you shall wish you had never been born</P>
<P>This treatment was too much for Hawkins's patience. There is no need, your honour, that I should come to you again about this affair. I have taken up my determination, and no accident or time can make any change in it. I am main sorry to displease your worship, and I know very well that you can do me a great deal of mischief. But I hope you will not be so hard hearted, as to ruin a father only for being fond of his child, even if so be that his fondness should make him do a foolish thing. But I cannot help it, your honour: you must do as you please. The poorest slave in the world has some point that he does not part with. I will lose all that I have, and go to day-labour, and my son too, if needs must; but I will not make a gentleman's servant of him.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="028752_0059_0FDBEFDEB3932BB8"/>
Very well, friend; very well! replied Tyrrel, foaming with rage. Depend upon it, I will re∣member you! Your pride shall have a downfal! G—damn it! is it come to this? Shall a lousy rascal, that farms his forty acres, pretend to beard the lord of the manor? I will tread you into paste! Let me advise you, scoundrel, to shut up your house, and quit my estate, and fly as if the devil was behind you! You may think yourself happy, if I be not too quick for you yet, if you escape in a whole skin! I would not suffer such a villain to remain upon my land a day longer, if I could gain the Indies by it!</P>
<P>Not so fast, your honour, answered Hawkins sturdily. I hope you will think better of it, and see that I have not been to blame. But, if you should not, there is some harm that you can do me, and some harm that you cannot. Though I am a plain working man, your honour, do you see? yet I am a man still. No; I have got a lease of my farm, and I shall not quit it o'thaten. I hope there is some law for poor folk, as well as for rich ones.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel, unused to contradiction, was pro∣voked beyond bearing at the courage and indepen∣dent spirit of his retainer. There was not a tenant upon his estate, or at least not one of Hawkins's mediocrity of fortune, whom the general policy of land-owners, and still more the arbitrary and un∣controulable temper of Mr. Tyrrel, did not effectu∣ally restrain from acts of open defiance.</P>
<P>Excellent, upon my soul! G—damn my blood! but you are a rare fellow. You have a lease, have you? You will not quit, not you! A pretty pass things are come to, if a lease can protect such fel∣lows as you against the lord of a manor! But you are for a trial of skill, are you? Oh, very well, friend, very well! With all my soul! Since it is
<PB N="58" REF="028752_0060_0FDBEFA1646F4540"/>
come to that, we will show you some pretty sport before we have done! But get you out of my sight, you rascal! I have not another word to say to you! Never darken my doors again!</P>
<P>Hawkins, to borrow the language of the world, was guilty in this affair of a double imprudence. He talked to his landlord in a more peremptory manner than the constitution and practices of this country allow a dependent to assume. But above all, having been thus hurried away by his resent∣ment, he ought to have foreseen the consequences. It was mere madness in him to think of contesting with a man of Mr. Tyrrel's eminence and fortune. It was a fawn contending with a lion. Nothing could have been more easy to predict, than that it was of no avail for him to have right on his side, when his adversary had influence and wealth, and therefore could so victoriously justify any extrava∣gancies that he might think proper to commit. This maxim was completely illustrated in the sequel. Wealth and despotism easily know how to engage those laws, which were perhaps at first in∣tended [witless and miserable precaution!] for the safeguards of the poor, as the coadjutors of their oppression.</P>
<P>From this moment Mr. Tyrrel was bent upon Hawkins's destruction; and he left no means un∣employed that could either harass or injure the ob∣ject of his persecution. He deprived him of his appointment of bailiff, and directed Barnes and his other dependents to do him ill offices upon all occasions. Mr. Tyrrel by the tenure of his manor was impropriator of the great tithes, and this cir∣cumstance afforded him frequent opportunities of petty altercation. The land of one part of Haw∣kins's farm, though covered with corn, was lower than the rest; and consequently exposed to occa∣sional inundations from a river by which it was
<PB N="59" REF="028752_0061_0FDBEFDFE2AAD8F0"/>
bounded. Mr. Tyrrel had a dam belonging to this river privately cut about a fortnight before the sea∣son of harvest, and laid the whole under water. He ordered his servants to pull away the fences of the higher ground during the night, and to turn in his cattle to the utter destruction of the crop. These expedients however applied to only one part of the property of this unfortunate man. But Mr. Tyrrel did not stop here. A sudden morta∣lity took place among Hawkins's live stock, at∣tended with very suspicious circumstances. Haw∣kins's vigilance was strongly excited by this event, and he at length succeeded in tracing the matter so accurately that he conceived he could bring it home to Mr. Tyrrel himself.</P>
<P>Hawkins had hitherto carefully avoided, not∣withstanding the injuries he had suffered, attempt∣ing to right himself by a legal process, being of opinion that law was better adapted for a weapon of tyranny in the hands of the rich, than for a shield to protect the humbler part of the commu∣nity against their usurpations. In this last instance however he conceived that the offence was so atro∣cious as to make it impossible that any rank could protect the culprit against the severity of justice. In the sequel he saw reason to applaud himself for his former inactivity in this respect, and to repent that any motive had been strong enough to per∣suade him into a contrary system.</P>
<P>This was the very point to which Mr. Tyrrel wanted to bring him, and he could scarcely credit his good fortune, when he was told that Hawkins had entered an action. His congratulation upon this occasion was immoderate, as he now conceived that the ruin of his late favourite was irretrievable. He consulted his attorney, and urged him by every motive he could devise to employ the whole series of his subterfuges in the present affair. The direct re∣pelling
<PB N="60" REF="028752_0062_0FDBEFA46536A450"/>
of the charge exhibited against him was the least part of his care; the business was, by affida∣vits, motions, pleas, demurrers, flaws and appeals, to protract the question from term to term and from court to court. It would, as Mr. Tyrrel ar∣gued, be the disgrace of a civilized country, if a gentleman, when insolently attacked in law by the scum of the earth, could not convert the cause into a question of the longest purse, and stick in the skirts of his adversary till he had reduced him to beggary.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel however was by no means so far en∣grossed by his law-suit, as to neglect other methods of proceeding offensively against his tenant. Among the various expedients that suggested themselves there was one, which, though it tended rather to torment than irreparably injure the sufferer, was not rejected. This was derived from the particu∣lar situation of Hawkins's house, barns, stacks and out-houses. These were placed at the extremity of a strip of land connecting them with the rest of the farm, and were surrounded on three sides by fields in the occupation of one of Mr Tyrrel's tenants most devoted to the pleasures of the land∣lord. The road to the market town ran at the bottom of the largest of these fields, and was di∣rectly in view of the front of the house. No in∣convenience had yet arisen from that circumstance, as there had been a broad path time out of mind, that intersected this field, and led directly from Hawkins's house to the road. This path, or pri∣vate road, was now by concert of Mr. Tyrrel and his obliging tenant shut up, so as to make Hawkins a sort of prisoner in his own domains, and oblige him to go near a mile about for the purposes of his traffic.</P>
<P>Young Hawkins, the lad who had been the original subject of dispute between his father and
<PB N="61" REF="028752_0063_0FDBEFE5DA468448"/>
the squire, had much of his father's spirit, and felt an uncontroulable indignation against the successive acts of despotism of which he was a witness. His resentment of them was the greater, because the sufferings to which his parent was exposed, all of them, flowed from affection to him, at the same time that he could not propose removing the ground of dispute, as by so doing he would seem to fly in the face of his father's paternal kindness. Upon the present occasion, without asking any counsel but of his own impatient resentment, he went in the middle of the night and removed all the ob∣structions that had been placed in the way of the old path, broke the padlocks that had been fixed, and threw open the gates. In these operations he did not proceed unobserved, and the next day a warrant was issued for apprehending him. He was accordingly carried before a bench of justices, and by them committed to the county jail, to take his trial for the burglary at the next assizes.</P>
<P>This was the finishing stroke to Hawkins's mi∣series: as he was not deficient in courage, he had stood up against his other persecutions without flinching. He was not unaware of the advantages which our laws and customs give to the rich over the poor in contentions of this kind. But, being once involved, there was a stubbornness in his na∣ture that would not allow him to retract, and he suffered himself to hope rather than expect a fa∣vourable issue. But in this last event he was wounded in the point that was nearest his heart. He had feared to have his son contaminated and debased by a servile station, and he now saw him transferred to the seminary of a jail. He was even uncertain as to the issue of his imprisonment, and trembled to think what the tyranny of wealth might effect to blast his hopes for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="028752_0064_0FDBEFA554090358"/>
From this moment his heart died within him. He had trusted to persevering industry and skill to save the wreck of his little property from the vul∣gar spite of his landlord. But he had now no lon∣ger any spirit to exert those efforts which his situ∣ation more than ever required. Mr. Tyrrel pro∣ceeded without remission in his machinations; Hawkins's affairs every day grew more desperate; and the squire, watching the occasion, took the earliest opportunity of seizing upon his remaining property in the mode of a distress for rent.</P>
<P>It was precisely in this stage of the affair that Mr. Falkland and Mr. Tyrrel accidentally met in a private road near the habitation of the latter. They were on horseback, and Mr. Falkland was going to the house of the unfortunate tenant who seemed upon the point of perishing under his land∣lord's malice. He had been just made acquainted with the tale of this persecution. It had indeed been an additional aggravation of Hawkins's cala∣mity that Mr. Falkland, whose interference might otherwise have saved him, had been absent from the neighbourhood for a considerable time. He had been three months in London, and from thence had gone to visit his estates in another part of the island. The proud and self-confident spirit of this poor fellow always disposed him to depend as long as possible upon his own exertions. He had avoided applying to Mr. Falkland, or indeed indulging himself in any manner in communicating and be∣wailing his hard hap, in the beginning of the con∣tention; and, when the extremity grew more urgent, and he would have been willing to recede in some degree from the stubbornness of his mea∣sures, he found it no longer in his power. After an absence of considerable duration Mr. Falkland at length returned somewhat unexpectedly; and, having learned among the first articles of country
<PB N="63" REF="028752_0065_0FDBEFE6972AAA00"/>
intelligence the distresses of this unfortunate yeo∣man, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e resolved to ride over to his house the next morning, and surprize him with all the relief it was in his power to bestow.</P>
<P>At sight of Mr. Tyrrel in this unexpected ren∣counter, his face reddened with indignation. His first feeling, as he afterwards said, was to avoid him; but, finding that he must pass him, he con∣ceived that it would be a want of spirit and deser∣tion of duty not to acquaint him with his feelings on the present occasion.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel, said he somewhat abruptly, I am sorry for a piece of news which it has just been my fortune to hear.</P>
<P>Well, sir, and what is that? What have I to do with your sorrow?</P>
<P>A great deal, sir. It is caused by the distresses of a poor tenant of your's, Hawkins. If your steward have proceeded without your authority, I think it right to inform you of what he has done; and, if he has had your authority, I would gladly persuade you to think better of it.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland, it would be quite as well if you would mind your own business, and leave me to mind mine. I want no monitor, and I will have none.</P>
<P>You mistake, Mr. Tyrrel; I am minding my own business. If I see you fall into a pit, it is my business to draw you out, and save your life. If I see you pursuing a wrong line of conduct, it is my business to set you right and save your honour.</P>
<P>Zounds, sir, do not think to put any of your conundrums upon me! Is not the man my tenant? Is not my estate my own? What signifies calling it mine, if I am not to have the direction of it? Sir, I pay for what I have; I owe no man a penny; and I will not put my estate to nurse to you, nor the best he that wears a head.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="028752_0066_0FDBEFA6D4C254C0"/>
Mr. Tyrrel, I do not dispute your authority; I do not desire to dictate to you; I simply wish to do you a good office.</P>
<P>Do not desire to dictate! no, nor you shall not, sir. How dare you attempt to stop me upon the king's highway!</P>
<P>Sir, I know that you bear me no good will. I am but an ill mediator in this case, and should not have sought you. But, thus thrust by acci∣dent in your way, I must have leave to tell you my thoughts.</P>
<P>True, sir, I hate you. And what I hate you most for is this damned impertinence of pretending to be wiser than every body else. Is not this a free country, and may not every body do as he likes?</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel, I know your humour, and will bear as much as I can. What do you mean, sir, by a free country? I put no compulsion upon you. There is room enough; ride by me, if you please! Sir, I defy you not to hear me, while I tell you coolly and firmly, you are greatly to blame, and must change your mode of proceeding!</P>
<P>This is very extraordinary usage! Sir, I am not to blame. You know nothing about the matter. Do you think I will let a paltry fellow like this Hawkins insult me for nothing? Damn my soul, if I will not have the heart's blood of him!</P>
<P>It is very true, Mr. Tyrrel, that there is a dis∣tinction of ranks. I believe that distinction to be a good thing. But, however necessary it may be, we must acknowledge that it puts some hardships upon the lower orders of society. It makes one's heart ache to think that one man is born to the inherit∣ance of every superfluity, while the whole share of another, without any demerit of his, is drud∣gery and starving; and that all this is indispensable. We that are rich, Mr. Tyrrel, must do every thing in our power to lighten the yoke of these unfor∣tunate
<PB N="65" REF="028752_0067_0FDBEFECD798A640"/>
people. We must not use the advantage that accident has given us, with an unmerciful hand. Poor wretches! they are pressed almost be∣yond bearing as it is; and if we unfeelingly give another turn to the machine, they will be crushed into atoms.</P>
<P>This picture was not without its effect even upon the obdurate mind of Mr. Tyrrel.—Well, sir, I am no tyrant. I know very well that tyranny is a bad thing. But you do not infer from thence that these people are to do as they please, and never to meet with their deserts?</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel, I see that you are shaken in your animosity. Suffer me to hail the new-born bene∣volence of your nature. Go with me to Hawkins. Do not let us talk of his deserts! poor fellow! he has suffered almost all that human nature can en∣dure. Let your forgiveness upon this occasion be the earnest of good neighbourhood and friendship between you and me.</P>
<P>No, sir, I will not go. I own there is something in what you say. I always knew you had the wit to make good your own story, and tell a plausible tale. But I will not be come over thus. It has always been my character, when I had once con∣ceived a scheme of vengeance never to forego it; and I will not change that character. I took up Hawkins when every body forsook him, and made a man of him; and the ungrateful rascal has only insulted me for my pains. Curse me, if ever I forgive him! It would be a good jest indeed, if I were to forgive the insolence of my own creature, at the desire of a man like you that has been my perpetual plague.</P>
<P>For God's sake, Mr. Tyrrel, have some reason in your resentment! Let us suppose that Hawkins has behaved unjustifiably, and insulted you. Is that an offence that can never be expiated? Must
<PB N="66" REF="028752_0068_0FDBEFAD0291A760"/>
the father be ruined, and the son hanged, to glut your resentment?</P>
<P>Damn me, sir, but you may talk your heart out; you shall get nothing of me. I shall never forgive myself for having listened to you for a moment. I will suffer nobody to stop the stream of my resent∣ment; if I ever were to forgive him, it should be at nobody's intreaty but my own. But, sir, I never will. If he and all his family were at my feet, I would order them all to be hanged the next minute, if my power were as good as my will.</P>
<P>Very well, sir, I have done. I have only to tell you beforehand that such tyranny as your's will make you the universal abhorrence of mankind. You may hug yourself in your wealth and impu∣nity, but be sure the genuine sense of the world will pierce through all your intrenchments, and fully avenge those for whose blood you so cruelly thirst. Good day to you.</P>
<P>Such was the conference of Mr. Falkland and Mr. Tyrrel respecting this odious transaction. In one part it seemed to promise a more favourable issue. But the rooted depravity of the one, and perhaps the haughty impatience of the other, soon put an end to this agreeable prospect. For Mr. Tyrrel, the aversion he entertained for his accom∣plished neighbour hourly increased. It seemed as if, the more incontestibly his excellencies displayed themselves, the more bitter and inexpiable was the abhorrence he conceived for him. Having set out with contempt, and persuaded himself of the un∣pardonable injustice of those by whom Mr. Falk∣land was esteemed, he was probably anxious to ex∣clude the evidence of his worth; and, as that evi∣dence went on to increase, the struggle became more painful, and the situation more excruciating. In this respect the state of Mr. Tyrrel's mind was perhaps peculiarly critical; and, if we should allow
<PB N="67" REF="028752_0069_0FDBEFEED31139C0"/>
ourselves to judge from the appearances exhibited in the present case, we should be apt to lay it down as a sort of general maxim, that the greatest cri∣minal, when he perpetrates the most atrocious act, is upon the very eve of yielding to the energy of truth, and relinquishing for ever his odious de∣signs.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland departed from this conference with a confirmed disapprobation of the conduct of his neighbour, and an unalterable resolution to do every thing in his power to relieve the distresses of Hawkins. But he was too late. When he ar∣rived, he found the house already evacuated by its master. The family was removed nobody knew whither; Hawkins was absconded; and, what was still more extraordinary, the boy Hawkins had escaped on the very same day from the county jail. The enquiries Mr. Falkland set on foot after them were fruitless; no traces could be found of the catastrophe of these unhappy people. That catas∣trophe I shall have occasion shortly to relate; and it will be found pregnant with horror, beyond what the blackest misanthropy could readily have sug∣gested.</P>
<P>I go on with my tale. I go on to relate those incidents in which my own fate was so mysteriously involved. The temper of Mr. Tyrrel, soured with perpetual disappointment, became every day more peevish, arrogant and morose. The reader has seen what it was in the commencement. But every thing has its limits beyond which it can aug∣ment no farther. I lift the curtain, and bring for∣ward the last act of the tragedy.</P>

<PB N="68" REF="028752_0070_0FDBEFAE5F5E74E0"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<P>THE vices of Mr. Tyrrel, in their present state of augmentation, were peculiarly exercised upon his domestics and dependents. But the principal sufferer was Miss Emily Melvile, the orphan daugh∣ter of his father's sister. Miss Melvile's mother had married unfortunately, or rather imprudently, against the consent of her relations, all of whom had agreed to withdraw their countenance from her in consequence of that precipitate step. Her husband had turned out to be no better than an adventurer; had spent her fortune, which in con∣sequence of the irreconcilableness of her family was less than he expected, and broken her heart. Her infant daughter was left without any resource upon the wide world. In this situation the representa∣tions of the people with whom she happened to be placed prevailed upon Mrs. Tyrrel, the mother of the squire, to receive her into her family. In equity perhaps she was entitled to that portion of fortune which her mother had for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eited by her im∣prudence, and which had gone to swell the pro∣perty of the male representative. But this idea had never entered into the conceptions of either mother or son. Mrs. Tyrrel conceived that she performed an act of the most exalted benevolence in admit∣ting Miss Emily into a sort of amphibious situation, which was neither precisely that of a domestic, nor yet marked with the treatment that might seem due to one of the family.</P>
<P>She had not however at first been sensible of all the mortifications that might have been expected
<PB N="69" REF="028752_0071_0FDBEFF469267838"/>
from her condition. Mrs. Tyrrel, though proud and imperious, was not ill-natured. The female, who lived in the family in the capacity of house-keeper, was a person who had seen better days, and whose disposition was extremely upright and amiable. She early contracted a friendship for the little Emily, who was indeed for the most part committed to her care. Emily on her side fully repaid the affection of her instructress, and learn∣ed with great docility the little accomplishments Mrs. Jakeman was able to communicate. But most of all she imbibed her chearful and artless temper, that extracted the agreeable and encouraging from all events, and prompted her to communicate her sentiments, which were never of the cynical cast, without modification or disguise. Beside the ad∣vantages Emily derived from Mrs. Jakeman, she was permitted to take lessons from the masters who came to Tyrrel Place for the instruction of her cousin; and, indeed, as the young gentleman was most frequently indisposed to attend to them, they would commonly have had nothing to do, had it not been for the fortunate presence of Miss Melvile. Mrs. Tyrrel therefore encouraged the studies of Emily on that score; in addition to which she ima∣gined that this living exhibition of instruction might operate as an indirect allurement to her dar∣ling Barnabas, the only species of motive she would suffer to be presented.</P>
<P>Emily, as she grew up, displayed an uncommon degree of sensibility, which under her circumstan∣ces would have been a source of perpetual dissatis∣faction, had it not been qualified with an extreme sweetness and easiness of temper. She was far from being entitled to the appellation of a beauty. Her person was <HI>petite</HI> and trivial; her complexion favoured of the <HI>brunette;</HI> and her face was marked with the small pox, sufficiently to destroy its even∣ness
<PB N="70" REF="028752_0072_0FDBEFB1F73A2348"/>
and polish, though not enough to annihilate its expression. But, though her appearance was not beautiful, it did not fail to be in a high degree engaging. Her complexion was at once healthful and delicate; her long dark eye-brows adapted themselves with facility to the various conceptions of her mind; and her looks bore the united im∣pression of an active discernment and a good-hu∣moured frankness. The instruction she had re∣ceived, as it was entirely of a casual nature, ex∣empted her from the evils of untutored ignorance, but not from a sort of native wildness, arguing a mind incapable of guile itself, or of suspecting it in others. She amused, without seeming conscious of the refined sense which her observations con∣tained: or rather having never been debauched with applause, she set light by her own qualifica∣tions; and talked from the pure gaiety of a youth∣ful heart acting upon the stores of a just under∣standing, and not with any expectation of being distinguished and admired.</P>
<P>The death of her aunt made very little change in her situation. This prudent lady, who would have thought it little less than sacrilege to have consider∣ed miss Melvile as a branch of the stock of the Tyr∣rels, took no other notice of her in her will, than barely putting her down for a hundred pounds in a catalogue of legacies to her servants. She had never been admitted into the intimacy and confi∣dence of Mrs. Tyrrel; and the young squire, now that she was left under his sole protection, seemed inclined to treat her with even more liberality than his mother had done. He had seen her grow up under his eye, and therefore, though there were but six years difference between their ages, he felt a kind of paternal interest in her welfare. Habit had rendered her in a manner necessary to him, and in every recess from the occupations of the
<PB N="71" REF="028752_0073_0FDBEFF654298F60"/>
field and the pleasures of the table, he found him∣self solitary and forlorn without the society of miss Melvile. Nearness of kindred and Emily's want of personal beauty prevented him from ever look∣ing on her with the eyes of desire. Her accom∣plishments were chiefly of the customary and su∣perficial kind, dancing and music. Her skill in the first led him sometimes to indulge her with a va∣cant corner in his carriage when he went to the neighbouring assembly; and, in whatever light he might himself think proper to regard her, he would have imagined his chambermaid, introduced by him, entitled to an undoubted place in the most splendid circle. Her musical talents were frequent∣ly employed for his amusement. She had the ho∣nour occasionally of playing him to sleep after the fatigues of the chace; and as he had some relish for harmonious sounds, she was frequently able to soothe him by their means from the perturbations of which his gloomy disposition was so eminently a slave. Upon the whole she might be considered as in some sort his favourite. She was the media∣tor to whom his tenants and domestics, when they had incurred his displeasure, were accustom∣ed to apply; the privileged companion that could handle this lion with impunity in the midst of his roarings. She spoke to him without fear; her so∣licitations were always good-natured and disinte∣rested; and when he repulsed her, he disarmed himself of half his terrors, and was contented to smile at her presumption.</P>
<P>Such had been for some years the situation of Miss Melvile. Its precariousness had been beguil∣ed, by the chearfulness of her own temper, and the uncommon forbearance with which she was treated by her savage protector. But his disposi∣tion, always brutal, had acquired a new degree of ferocity since the settlement of Mr. Falkland in his
<PB N="72" REF="028752_0074_0FDBEFB3941C1628"/>
neighbourhood. He occasionally forgot the gentle∣ness with which he had been accustomed to treat his good-natured cousin. Her little playful arts were not always successful in softening his rage; and he would sometimes turn upon her blandish∣ment with an impatient sternness that made her tremble. The careless ease of her disposition how∣ever soon effaced these impressions, and she fell without variation into her old habits.</P>
<P>A circumstance occurred about this time which put an end to the felicity, that miss Melvile in spite of the frowns of fortune had hitherto enjoyed. Emily was exactly seventeen when Mr. Falkland returned from the Continent. At this age she was peculiarly susceptible of the charms of beauty, grace and moral excellence, when united in a person of the other sex. She was imprudent, precisely be∣cause her own heart was incapable of guile. She had never yet felt the sting of the poverty to which she was condemned, and had not reflected on the insuperable distance that fortune has placed be∣tween the opulent and the poorer classes of the community. She beheld Mr. Falkland, whenever he was thrown in her way at any of the public meetings with admiration; and, without having precisely explained to herself the sentiments she indulged, her eyes followed him through all the changes of the scene with eagerness and impa∣tience. She did not see him, as the rest of the assembly did, born to one of the amplest estates in the county, and qualified to assert his title to the rich∣est heiress. She thought only of Falkland, with those advantages which were most intimately his own, and of which no persecution of adverse fortune had the ability to deprive him. In a word she was transported when he was present; he was the per∣petual subject of her reveries and her dreams; but
<PB N="73" REF="028752_0075_0FDBEFFC11B003E0"/>
his image excited no sentiment in her mind beyond that of the immediate pleasure annexed to the idea.</P>
<P>The notice Mr. Falkland had taken of her in re∣turn appeared sufficiently encouraging to a mind so full of prepossession as that of Emily. There was a particular complacency in his looks when direct∣ed towards her. He had said in a company, of which one of the persons present repeated his re∣marks to Miss Melvile, that she appeared to him amiable and interesting, that he felt for her unpro∣vided and destitute situation, and that he should have been glad to be more particular in his notice of her, had he not been apprehensive of doing her a prejudice in the suspicious mind of Mr. Tyrrel. All this she treated as the ravishing condescension of a superior nature; for, if she did not recollect with sufficient assiduity his gifts of fortune, she was on the other hand filled with reverence for his unrivalled accomplishments. But, while she thus seemingly disclaimed all comparison between Mr. Falkland and herself, she probably cherished a con∣fused idea that some event was yet in the womb of fate which might reconcile things apparently the most incompatible. Fraught with these prepos∣sessions, the civilities that had once or twice oc∣curred in the bustle of a public circle, the restor∣ing her fan which she had dropped, or the discom∣moding her of an empty tea-cup, made her heart palpitate, and gave birth to the wildest chimeras in her deluded imagination.</P>
<P>About this time an event happened that helped to give a precise determination to the fluctuations of Miss Melvile's mind. One evening, a short time after the death of Mr. Clare, Mr. Falkland had been to the house of his deceased friend in his quality of executor, and by some accidents of little intrinsic importance had been detained three or
<PB N="74" REF="028752_0076_0FDBD6C1F69C54D8"/>
four hours later than he intended. He did not set out upon his return till two o'clock in the morn∣ing. At this time, in a situation so remote from the metropolis, every thing is as silent as it would be in a region wholly uninhabited. The moon shone bright, and the objects around, being mark∣ed with strong variations of light and shade at the same time that they were not distinctly seen, gave a kind of sacred solemnity to the scene. Mr. Falk∣land had taken Collins with him, the business to be settled at Mr. Clare's being in some respects similar to that to which this faithful domestic had been accustomed in the routine of his ordinary service. They had entered into some conversation, for Mr. Falkland was not then in the habit of obliging the persons about him by formality and reserve to re∣collect who he was. The attractions of the scene made them break off the talk somewhat abruptly, that they might enjoy it without interruption. They had not rode far, before a hollow wind seem∣ed to rise at a distance, and they could hear the hoarse roarings of the sea. Presently the sky on one side assumed the appearance of a reddish brown, and a sudden angle in the road placed this phenomenon directly before them. As they proceeded it be∣came more distinct, and it was at length suffi∣ciently visible that it was occasioned by a fire. Mr. Falkland put spurs to his horse; and, as they ap∣proached, the object presented every instant a more tremendous appearance. The flames ascended with fierceness; they embraced a large portion of the horizon; and, as they carried up along with them numerous little fragments of the materials that fed them, impregnated with fire, and of an extremely bright and luminous colour, they pre∣sented no inadequate image of the eruption of a volcano.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="028752_0077_0FDBF0002A609A30"/>
The flames proceeded from a village directly in their road. There were eight or ten houses already on fire, and the whole seemed to be threatened with immediate destruction. The inhabitants were in the utmost consternation, having had no pre∣vious experience of a similar calamity. They con∣veyed with haste their moveables and furniture into the adjoining fields, the whole surface of which was heated to an uncommon degree. When any of them had effected this as far as it could be at∣tempted with safety, they were unable to conceive any farther remedy, but stood wringing their hands and contemplating the ravages of the fire in an agony of powerless despair. The water that could be procured in any mode practised in that place, was but as a drop contending with a whole element in arms. The wind in the mean time was rising, and the flames spread with more and more ra∣pidity.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland contemplated this scene for a few minutes, as if ruminating with himself as to what could be done. He then directed some of the country people about him to pull down a house, next to one that was wholly on fire, but which it∣self was not yet touched. They seemed astonished at a direction which implied a voluntary destruc∣tion of property, and considered the task as too much in the heart of the danger to be undertaken. Observing that they were motionless, he dismount∣ed from his horse, and called upon them in an au∣thoritative voice to follow him. He ascended the house in an instant, and presently appeared upon the top of it as if in the midst of the flames. Having, with the assistance of two or three of the persons that followed him most closely, and who by this time had supplied themselves with whatever tools came next to hand, loosened the support of a stack of chimnies, he pushed them headlong into
<PB N="76" REF="028752_0078_0FDBEFB8CC8830E0"/>
the midst of the fire. He passed and repassed along the roof; and, having set people to work on all parts, descended in order to see what could be done in any other quarter.</P>
<P>At this moment an elderly woman burst from the midst of a house in flames. The utmost con∣sternation was painted in her looks; and, as soon as she could recollect herself enough to have a pro∣per idea of her situation, the subject of her anxiety seemed in an instant to be totally changed. Where is my child? cried she, and cast an anxious and piercing look among the surrounding crowd. Oh, she is lost! she is in the midst of the flames! Save her! save her! my child! She filled the air with heart-rending shrieks. She turned towards the house. The people that were near endeavoured to prevent her, but she shook them off in a moment. She entered the passage; viewed the hideous ruin; and was then going to plunge into the blazing stair∣case. Mr. Falkland seized her arm; it was Mrs. Jakeman. Stop! he cried, with a voice that seem∣ed more than human. Stay you here! I will seek, I will save her! He charged the attendants to detain Mrs. Jakeman; he enquired which was the apartment of Emily. Mrs. Jakeman was upon a visit to a sister who lived in the village, and had brought Emily along with her. Mr. Falkland as∣cended a neighbouring house; entered that in which Emily was, by a window in the roof; and in two minutes re-appeared with his lovely burthen in his arms. Having restored her to her affec∣tionate protector snatched from the immediate grasp of death, from which, if he had not, none would have delivered her, he returned to his for∣mer task. By his presence of mind, by his inde∣fatigable humanity and incessant exertions, he saved three-fourths of the village from destruction. The conflagration being at length abated, he sought
<PB N="77" REF="028752_0079_0FDBF00253ACC228"/>
again Mrs. Jakeman and Emily. He displayed the tenderest solicitude for the young lady's safety, and directed Collins to go with as much speed as he could, and send his chariot to attend her. More than an hour elapsed in this interval. Miss Mel∣vile had never seen so much of Mr. Falkland upon any former occasion, and the spectacle of such hu∣manity, delicacy, firmness and justice in the form of man, as he crowded into this small space, was both altogether new to her, and in the highest de∣gree fascinating.</P>
<P>Emily no sooner arrived at the family mansion, than Mr. Tyrrel ran out to receive her. He had just heard of the melancholy accident that had taken place at the village, and was terrified for the safety of his good-humoured cousin. He display∣ed those unpremeditated emotions which are com∣mon to almost every individual of the human race. He was greatly shocked at the suspicion that Emily might possibly have become the victim of a catas∣trophe which had thus broken out in the very dead of night. His sensations were of the most pleasing sort, when he folded her in his arms, and fearful apprehension was instantaneously converted into joyous certainty. Emily no sooner entered the well-known roof, than she forgot all she had suffer∣ed; her spirits were brisk, and her tongue inces∣sant in describing her danger and her deliverance. Mr. Tyrrel had formerly been tortured with the innocent eulogiums she pronounced of Mr. Falk∣land. But these were tameness itself, compared with the rich and various eloquence that now flowed from her lips. She described his activity and his resources, the promptitude with which every thing was conceived, and the cautious, but daring wisdom with which it was executed. All was fairy-land and enchantment in the tenour of her artless tale; you saw a beneficent genius sur∣veying
<PB N="78" REF="028752_0080_0FDBEFBA529CA600"/>
and controuling the whole, but could have no notion of any human means by which his pur∣poses were effected.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel listened for a while to these innocent effusions with patience; he could even bear to hear the man applauded by whom he had just obtained so considerable a benefit. But the theme by am∣plification became nauseous, and he was at length obliged with some roughness to put an end to the tale. Probably upon recollection it appeared still more insolent and intolerable than while it was passing; the sensation of gratitude wore off, but the hyperbolical praise that had been bestowed still haunted his memory, and sounded in his ear: Emily seemed to have entered into the confederacy that disturbed his repose. As for the young lady herself, she was wholly unconscious of the offence that had been given, and upon every occasion quoted Mr. Falkland as the model of elegant man∣ners and true wisdom. She was a total stranger to dissimulation; and she could not conceive that any body beheld the object of her admiration with less partiality than her inexperienced heart had enter∣tained. Meanwhile her artless love became more fervent than ever. She flattered herself that no∣thing less than a reciprocal passion could have prompted Mr. Falkland to the desperate attempt of saving her from the flames; and she trusted that this passion would speedily burst the barriers of silence, as well as induce the object of her affec∣tion to overlook her comparative unworthiness.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel endeavoured at first to check Miss Melvile in her applauses, and to convince her by various tokens that the subject was disagreeable to him. Emily was accustomed to yield implicit and unreluctant obedience, and therefore it was not difficult to restrain her; but upon the very next occasion her favourite topic would force its way to
<PB N="79" REF="028752_0081_0FDBF007D35A1DE8"/>
her lips. Her obedience was the acquiescence of a frank and benevolent heart; but it was the most difficult thing in the world to inspire her with fear. Conscious herself that she would not hurt a worm, she could not conceive that any one would harbour cruelty and rancour against her. Her temper pre∣served her from obstinate contention with the per∣sons under whose protection she was placed; and, as her compliance was unhesitating, she had had no experience of a severe and rigorous treatment. As Mr. Tyrrel's objection to the very name of Falkland became more palpable and uniform, Miss Melvile increased in her precaution. She would stop herself in the half-pronounced sentences that were meant to his praise. This circumstance had necessarily an ungracious effect; it was a cutting satire upon the imbecility of her kinsman. Upon these occasions she would sometimes venture upon a good-humoured expostulation: Dear sir! well, I wonder how you can be so ill-natured! I am sure Mr. Falkland would do you any good office in the world: till she was checked by some gesture of im∣patience and fierceness.</P>
<P>At length she wholly conquered her heedlessness and inattention. But it was now too late. Mr. Tyrrel already suspected the existence of that pas∣sion which she had thoughtlessly imbibed. His imagination, ingenious in torment, suggested to him all the different openings in conversation in which she would have introduced the praise of Mr. Falkland, had she not been placed under this un∣natural restraint. Her present reserve upon the subject was more insufferable than even her former loquacity. All his kindness for this unhappy or∣phan gradually subsided. Her partiality for the man who of all others was most the object of his hatred, appeared to him as the last persecution of a malicious destiny. He figured himself as about
<PB N="80" REF="028752_0082_0FDBEFBE8255F238"/>
to be deserted by every creature in human form, all men under the influence of a fatal enchantment approving only what was sophisticated and arti∣ficial, and holding the rude and genuine offspring of nature in mortal antipathy. Impressed with these gloomy presages, he saw miss Melvile with no sentiments but those of rancorous abhorrence; and, accustomed as he was to the uncontrouled in∣dulgence of all his propensities, determined to wreak upon her a signal revenge.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>MR. TYRREL consulted his old confident re∣specting the plan he should pursue, who on his part felt no compunction upon the subject, nor had any idea that an insignificant girl, without either wealth or beauty, ought to be allowed for a moment to stand in the way of the gratifications of a man of Mr. Tyrrel's importance. The first idea of her now-unrelenting kinsman was to thrust her from his doors, and leave her to seek her bread in the wide world. But he was conscious that this proceeding would involve him in considerable obloquy; and he at length fixed upon a scheme which, at the same time that he believed it would sufficiently shelter his reputation, would much more certainly secure her mortification and punishment.</P>
<P>For this purpose he fixed upon a young man of twenty, the son of one Grimes, who occupied a small farm the property of his confident. This fellow he resolved to impose as a husband on Miss Melvile, who he shrewdly suspected, guided by the tender sentiments she had unfortunately con∣ceived for Mr. Falkland, would listen with reluc∣tance to any matrimonial proposal. Grimes he se∣lected as being in all respects the diametrical reverse of Mr. Falkland. He was not precisely a lad of vicious propensities, but in an inconceivable degree boorish and uncouth. His complexion was scarcely human; his features were coarse, and strangely discordant and disjointed from each other. His lips were thick, and the tone of his voice broad
<PB N="82" REF="028752_0084_0FDBEFBF99641770"/>
and unmodulated. His legs were of equal size from one end to the other, and his feet mishapen and clumsy. He had nothing spiteful or malicious in his disposition, but he was a total stranger to tenderness; he could not feel for those refinements in others, of which he had no experience in him∣self. He was an expert boxer; his inclination led him to such amusements as were most boisterous; and he delighted in a sort of manual sarcasm, which he could not conceive to be very injurious, as it left no traces behind it. His general manners were noisy and obstreperous; inattentive to others; and obstinate and unyielding, not from any cruelty and ruggedness of temper, but from an incapacity to conceive those finer feelings that make so large a part of the history of persons who are cast in a gentler mould.</P>
<P>Such was the uncouth and half-civilised animal which the industrious malice of Mr. Tyrrel fixed upon as most happily adapted to his purpose. Emily had hitherto been in an unusual degree ex∣empted from the oppression of despotism. Her happy insignificance had served her as a protection. No one thought it worth his while to fetter her with those numerous petty restrictions, with which the daughters of opulence are commonly tormented. She had the wildness as well as the delicate frame of the bird that warbles unmolested in its native groves.</P>
<P>When therefore she heard from her kinsman the proposal of Mr. Grimes for a husband, she was for a moment silent with astonishment at so unex∣pected a suggestion. But, as soon as she recovered her speech, she replied: No, sir, I thank you. Bless me! I do not want a husband: I am but a child.</P>
<P>You are a woman! Are not you always han∣kering after the men? It is high time you should be settled.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="028752_0085_0FDBF00E75AC3430"/>
Mr. Grimes is such a strange man. Why, I do not know what he is like! He is like for all the world a great huge porpuss. No, I thank you! when I do have a husband, it shall not be such a man as Grimes neither.</P>
<P>Be silent! How dare you give your tongue such unaccountable liberties?</P>
<P>Well, I wonder what I should do with him. Why, it is like as if you should give me your great rough water-dog, and bid me make him a silk cushion to lie on in my dressing-room. Beside, sir, Grimes is a common labouring man, and I am sure I have always heard my aunt say that ours is a very great family.</P>
<P>It is a lie. Our family! Have you the impu∣dence to think yourself one of our family?</P>
<P>Lord, sir! was not your grandpapa my grand∣papa? And how then can we be of a different family?</P>
<P>For a damned strong reason. You are the daughter of a rascally Scotchman, who spent every shilling of my aunt Hannah's fortune, and left you a beggar. You have got a hundred pounds, and Grimes's father promises to give him as much. How dare you look down upon your equals?</P>
<P>Nay, now, sir, I am sure I am not proud. But indeed and indeed, sir, I can never love Mr. Grimes. Dear, dear! he is more like a cart-horse than a husband. I am very happy as I am. I love you, and I love Mrs. Jakeman: why should I be married?</P>
<P>Cease your prating! Grimes will be here this afternoon. Look that you behave well to him. If you do not, he will remember and repay when you least like it.</P>
<P>Now, I am sure, sir, you—you are not in ear∣nest?</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="028752_0086_0FDBEFC170723CA8"/>
Not in earnest! Damn me but we will see that. I can tell what you would be at. You had rather be Mr. Falkland's miss, than the wife of a plain downright yeoman. But I shall take care of you.—Aye, this comes of indulgence. You must be taken down, miss. You must be taught the dif∣ference between high-flown notions and realities. Mayhap you may take it a little in dudgeon or so. But never mind that. Pride always wants a little smarting. If you should be brought to shame, it is I that shall bear all the blame of it.</P>
<P>The tone in which Mr. Tyrrel spoke was so different from any thing to which Miss Melvile had been accustomed, that she felt herself wholly un∣able to determine what construction to put upon it. Sometimes she thought he had really formed a plan for imposing upon her a condition, that she could not bear so much as to think of. But pre∣sently she rejected this idea as an unworthy impu∣tation upon her kinsman, and concluded that it was only his way, and that all he meant was to try her. To be resolved however she determined to consult her constant adviser, Mrs. Jakeman, and accordingly repeated to her what had passed. Mrs. Jakeman saw the whole in a very different light from that in which Emily had conceived it, and trembled for the future peace of her beloved ward.</P>
<P>Lord bless me, my dear mamma! cried Emily, (this was the appellation she delighted to bestow upon the good house-keeper) sure you cannot think so. But I do not care. I will never marry Grimes let them do as they will.</P>
<P>But how will you help yourself? My master will oblige you.</P>
<P>Nay, now you think you are talking to a child indeed. It is I am to have the man, not Mr. Tyrrel. Do you think I will let any body else
<PB N="85" REF="028752_0087_0FDBF00FD4D0FEA8"/>
choose a husband for me? I am not such a fool as that neither.</P>
<P>Ah, Emily! you little know the disadvantages of your situation. Your cousin is a violent man, and perhaps will turn you out of doors, if you oppose him.</P>
<P>Oh, mamma, it is very wicked of you to say so. I am sure Mr. Tyrrel is a very good man, though he be a little cross now and then. He knows very well that I am right to have a will of my own in such a thing as this, and nobody is punished for doing what is right.</P>
<P>Nobody ought, my dear child. But there are very wicked and tyrannical men in the world.</P>
<P>Well, well, I will never believe that my cousin is one of those.</P>
<P>I hope he is not.</P>
<P>And, if he were, what then? To be sure I should be very sorry to make him angry.</P>
<P>What then? Why then my poor, dear Emily would be a beggar. Do you think I could bear to see that?</P>
<P>No, no. Mr. Tyrrel has just told me that I have a hundred pounds. But, if I had no fortune at all, is not that the case with a thousand other folks? Why should I grieve, for what they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear and are merry? Do not make yourself uneasy, mamma. I am determined that I will do any thing rather than marry Grimes however; that is what I will.</P>
<P>Mrs. Jakeman could not bear the uneasy state of suspense in which this conversation left her mind, and went immediately to the squire to have her doubts resolved. The manner in which she pro∣posed the question sufficiently indicated the judg∣ment she had formed of the match in question.</P>
<P>That is true, said Mr. Tyrrel, I wanted to speak to you about this affair. The girl has got unac∣countable
<PB N="86" REF="028752_0088_0FDBEFC2AC875678"/>
notions in her head, that will be the ruin of her. You perhaps can tell where she had them. But, be that as it may, it is high time something should be done. The shortest way is the best, and to keep things well while they are well. In short, I am determined she shall marry this lad: you do not know any harm of him, do you? You have a good deal of influence with her, and I de∣sire, do you see! that you will employ it to lead her to her good: you had best, I can tell you. She is a pert vixen! By and by she would be a whore, and at last no better than a common trull, and rot upon a dunghill, if I were not at all these pains to save her from destruction. I would make her an honest farmer's wife, and my pretty miss cannot bear the thoughts of it!</P>
<P>In the afternoon Grimes came according to ap∣pointment, and was left alone with the young lady. Well, miss, said he, it seems the squire has a mind to make us man and wife. For my part, I cannot say I should have thought of it. But, being as how the squire has broke the ice, if so be as you like of the match, why I am your man. Say the word; a nod is as good as a wink to a blind horse; and then, do you see, why there is no more to be said.</P>
<P>Emily was already sufficiently mortified at the unexpected proposal of Mr. Tyrrel. She was con∣founded at the novelty of the situation, and still more at the uncultivated rudeness of her lover, which even exceeded her expectation. This con∣fusion was interpreted by Grimes into diffidence.</P>
<P>Come, come, never be cast down. Put a good face upon it. What though? My first sweetheart was Bet Butterfield, but what of that? What must be must be; grief will never fill the belly. She was a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine strapping wench, that is the truth of it! Five foot ten inches, and as stout as a
<PB N="87" REF="028752_0089_0FDBF01213ABD3E0"/>
trooper. Oh, she would do a power of work! Up early and down late; milked ten cows with her own hands; on with her cardinal, rode to market between her panniers, fair weather and foul, hail, blow or snow. It would have done your heart good to have seen her frost-bitten cheeks, as red as a beefen from her own orchard! Ah, she was a maid of mettle; would romp with the harvest men, slap one upon the back, wrestle with another, and had a rogue's trick and a joke for all round. Poor girl! she broke her neck down stairs at a christening. To be sure I shall never meet with her fellow! But never you mind that! I do not doubt that I shall find more in you upon farther acquaintance. As coy and bashful as you seem, I dare say you are rogue enough at bottom. When I have touzled and rumpled you a little, we shall see. I am no chicken, miss, whatever you may think me. I know what is what, and can see as far into a milstone as another. Ay▪ ay; you will come to. The fish will snap at the bait, never doubt it. Yes, yes, we shall rub on main well together.</P>
<P>Emily by this time had in some degree mustered up her spirits, and began, though with hesitation, to thank Mr. Grimes for his good opinion, but to confess that she could never be brought to favour his addresses. She therefore intreated him to de∣sist from all farther application. This remonstrance on her part would have become more intelligible, had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not been for his boisterous manners and ex∣travagant chearfulness, which indisposed him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> made him suppose that at half a word he had a sufficient intimation of another's meaning. Mr. Tyrrel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the mean time took care to interrupt the scene before they could have time to proceed far in explanation, and was studious in the sequel to prevent the young folks from being too intimately
<PB N="88" REF="028752_0090_0FDBEFC603302980"/>
acquainted with each other's inclinations. Grimes of consequence attributed all the reluctance of miss Melvile to maiden coyness, and the skittish shyness of an unbroken colt. Indeed had it been other∣wise, it is not probable that it would have made any effectual impression upon him; as he was always accustomed to talk of women as made for the recreation of the men, and to exclaim against the ill-judged weakness of people who taught them to imagine that they were entitled to judge for themselves.</P>
<P>As the suit proceeded and miss Melvile saw more of her new admirer, her antipathy increased. But, though her character was unspoiled by those false wants which frequently make people of family miserable while they have every thing that nature requires within their reach, yet she had been little used to opposition, and was really terrified by the growing sternness of her kinsman. Sometimes she thought of flying from a house which was now become her dungeon; but the habits of her youth, and her ignorance of the world made her shrink from this project when she contemplated it more nearly. Mrs. Jakeman indeed could not think with patience of young Grimes as a husband for her darling Emily, but her prudence determined her to resist with all her might the idea on the part of the young lady of proceeding to extremi∣ties. She could not believe that Mr. Tyrrel would persist in such an unaccountable persecution, and she exhorted miss Melvile to forget for a moment the unaffected independence of her character, and pathetically to deprecate Mr. Tyrrel's obstinacy. She had great confidence in the ingenuous elo∣quence of her ward. Mrs. Jakeman did not know what was passing in the mind of the tyrant.</P>
<P>Miss Melvile complied with the suggestion of her mamma. One morning immediately after break∣fast
<PB N="89" REF="028752_0091_0FDBF017DB87C678"/>
she went to the harpsichord, and played one after another several of those airs that were most the favòurites of Mr. Tyrrel. Mrs. Jakeman was retired; the servants were gone to their respective employments. Mr. Tyrrel would have gone also; his mind was untuned, and he did not take the pleasure he had been accustomed to take in the musical performances of Emily. But her finger was now more tasteful than common. Her mind was probably wrought up to a firmer and bolder tone by the recollection of the cause she was going to plead, at the same time that it was exempt from those incapacitating tremors which would have been felt by one that dared not look poverty in the face. Mr. Tyrrel was unable to leave the apart∣ment. Sometimes he traversed it with impatient step; then he hung over the poor innocent whose powers were exerted to please him; at length he threw himself in a chair opposite, with his eyes turned towards Emily. It was easy to trace the progress of his emotions. The furrows into which his countenance was contracted were gradually re∣laxed; his features were brightened into a smile; the kindness with which he had upon former occa∣sions contemplated Emily seemed to revive in his heart.</P>
<P>Emily watched her opportunity. As soon as she had finished one of the pieces, she rose and went to Mr. Tyrrel.</P>
<P>Now have I not done it nicely? And after all this will not you give me a reward?</P>
<P>A reward! Ay, come here, and I will give you a kiss.</P>
<P>Pooh! no, that is not it. And yet you have not kissed me this many a day. Formerly you said you loved me, and called me your Emily. I am sure you did not love me better than I loved you. You would not make me miserable, would you?</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="028752_0092_0FDBEFC8DC5985C8"/>
Miserable! how can you ask such a question? But have a care! Do not put me out of humour. Do not come with any of your romantic notions now.</P>
<P>No, no. I had no romantic notions in my head. I want to speak to you about something upon which the happiness of my life depends.</P>
<P>I know what you would be at. Be silent. You know it is to no purpose to plague me with your stubbornness. You will not let me be in good hu∣mour with you for a moment. What my mind is determined on about Grimes, all the world shall not move me to give up.</P>
<P>Dear, dear cousin, why do but consider now. Grimes is a rough rustic lout, like Orson in the story-book. He wants a wife like himself. He would be as uneasy and as much at a loss with me, as I with him. Why should we both of us be forced to do what neither of us is inclined to? I cannot think what could ever have put it in your head. But now, for goodness' sake, give it up. Marriage is a serious thing. You should not think of join∣ing two people for a whim, who are neither of them fit for one another in any respect in the world. We should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eel mortified and disappoint∣ed all our lives. Month would go after month, and year after year, and I could never hope to be my own but by the death of a person I ought to love. I am sure, sir, you cannot mean me all this harm. What have I done, that I should deserve to have you for this enemy?</P>
<P>I am not your enemy. I tell you that it is ne∣cessary to put you out of harm's way. But, if I were your enemy, I could not be a worse torment to you than you are to me. Are not you conti∣nually singing the praises of Falkland? Are not you in love with Falkland? That man is a legion of devils to me! Plausible and empty himself, he
<PB N="91" REF="028752_0093_0FDBF018D4780938"/>
cheats every body, he crosses me in all my wishes; he runs away with the applause of the men, and the admiration of your foolish sex. An unspoiled, genuine country-gentleman has no chance with him. I might as well have been a beggar! I might as well have been a dwarf or a monster! Time was when I was thought entitled to respect. But now, debauched by this Frenchified rascal, they call me rude, surly, brutal, a tyrant! It is true that I can∣not talk in these finical phrases, flatter people with hypocritical praise, or suppress the real feelings of my mind! The scoundrel knows all his pitiful ad∣vantages, and insults me upon them without cea∣sing. He is my rival and my persecutor. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> last, as if all this were not enough, he has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> means to spread the pestilence in my own family. You, whom we took up out of charity, the chance-born brat of a stolen marriage! you, must turn upon your benefactor, and wound me in the point where of all others I could least bear it. If I were your enemy, should I not have reason? Could I ever inflict upon you such injuries as you have made me suffer? And who are you? The lives of twenty such as you cannot atone for an hour of my uneasiness. If you were to linger for twenty years upon the rack, you would never feel what I have felt. But I am your friend. I see which way you are going, and I am determined to save you from the thief, the hypocritical destroyer of us all. Every moment that the mischief is left to itself it does but make bad worse, and I am determined to save you out of hand.</P>
<P>The angry expostulations of Mr. Tyrrel suggest∣ed new ideas to the tender mind of miss Melvile. He had never confessed the emotions of his soul so explicitly before; but the growing tempest of his thoughts suffered him to be no longer master of himself. She saw with astonishment that he was
<PB N="92" REF="028752_0094_0FDBEFCC5FDC3830"/>
the irreconcilable foe of Mr. Falkland, whom she fondly imagined it was the same thing to know and admire; and that he harboured a deep and rooted resentment against herself. She recoiled without well knowing why before the ferocious passions of her kinsman, and was convinced that she had no∣thing to hope from his implacable temper. But her alarm was the prelude of firmness and not of cowardice.</P>
<P>No, sir, replied she, indeed I will not be driven any way that you happen to like. I have been used to obey you, and in any thing that is reason∣able I will obey you still. But you urge me a little too far. Why do you tell me of Mr. Falkland? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I ever done any thing to deserve your unkind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>spicions? I am innocent, and will continue in∣nocent. Mr. Grimes is well enough, and will no doubt find women that like him. But he is not sit for me, and torture shall not force me to be his wife.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel was not a little astonished at the spirit which Emily displayed upon this occasion. He had calculated too securely upon the general mildness and suavity of her disposition. He now endeavoured to qualify the harshness of his former sentiments.</P>
<P>G—damn my soul! And so you can scold can you? You expect every body to turn out of his way, and fetch and carry, just as you please? I could find in my heart to break your heart. But you know my mind. I insist upon it that you let Grimes court you, and that you lay aside your sulks, and give him a fair hearing. Will you do that? If then you persist in your wilfulness, why there, I suppose, is an end of the matter. Do not think that any body is going to marry you, whether you will or no. You are no such mighty prize, I as∣sure you. If you knew your own interest, you
<PB N="93" REF="028752_0095_0FDBF020B871F768"/>
would be glad to take the young fellow, while he is willing.</P>
<P>Miss Melvile rejoiced in the prospect which the last words of her kinsman afforded her, of a ter∣mination at no great distance to her present perse∣cutions. Mrs. Jakeman, to whom she communi∣cated them, congratulated Emily on the returning moderation and good sense of the squire, and her∣self on her prudence in having urged the young lady to this happy expostulation. But their mu∣tual felicitations lasted not long. Mr. Tyrrel in∣formed Mrs. Jakeman of the necessity in which he found himself of sending her to a distance upon a business which would not fail to detain her seve∣ral weeks; and, though the errand by no means wore an artificial or ambiguous face, the two friends drew a melancholy presage from this ill-timed se∣paration. Mrs. Jakeman in the mean time exhort∣ed her ward to persevere, reminded her of the com∣punction which had already been manifested by her kinsman, and encouraged her to hope every thing from her courage and good temper. Emily on her part, though grieved at the absence of her protector and counsellor at so interesting a crisis, was unable to suspect Mr. Tyrrel of such a degree either of malice or duplicity as could afford ground for serious alarm. She congratulated herself upon her delivery from so alarming a persecution, and drew a prognostic of future success from this happy termination of the first serious affair of her life. She exchanged a state of fortitude and alarm for her former pleasing dreams respecting Mr. Falk∣land. These she bore without impatience. She was even taught by the uncertainty of the event to desire to prolong rather than abridge a situation, which might be delusive, but was not without its pleasures.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING could be farther from Mr. Tyrrel's intention than to suffer his project to be thus ter∣minated. No sooner was he wholly freed from the fear of his housekeeper's interference, than he changed the whole system of his conduct. He ordered Miss Melvile to be closely confined to her own apartment, and deprived of all the means of communicating her situation to any one out of his own house. He placed over her a female servant in whose discretion he could confide, and who, having formerly been honoured with some amorous notices from the squire, considered the distinctions that were paid to Emily at Tyrrel Place as an usur∣pation upon her more reasonable claims. The squire himself did every thing in his power to blast the young lady's reputation, and represented to his attendants all these precautions as necessary, to prevent her from eloping to his neighbour, and plunging herself in total ruin.</P>
<P>As soon as Miss Melvile had been twenty-four hours in durance, and there was some reason to suppose that her spirit might be subdued to the emergency of her situation, Mr. Tyrrel thought proper to go to her, to explain the grounds of her present treatment, and acquaint her with the only means by which she could hope for any change. Emily no sooner saw him, than she turned towards him with an air of greater firmness than perhaps she had ever assumed in her life, and accosted him thus:</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="028752_0097_0FDBF021D3C43228"/>
Well, sir, is it you? I wanted to see you. It seems I am shut up here by your orders? What does this mean? What right have you to make a prisoner of me? What do I owe you? Your mo∣ther left me a hundred pounds: have you ever offered to make any addition to my fortune? But, if you had, I do not want it I do not pretend to be better than the children of other poor parents; I can maintain myself as they do I prefer liberty to wealth. I see you are surprised at the resolu∣tion I exert. But ought I not to turn again, when I am trampled upon? I should have left you be∣fore now, if Mrs. Jakeman had not overpersuaded me, and if I had not thought better of you than by your present behaviour I find you deserve. But now, sir, I intend to leave your house this moment, and I insist upon it that you do not endeavour to prevent me.</P>
<P>Thus saying, she arose, and went towards the door, while Mr. Tyrrel stood thunderstruck at her magnanimity. Seeing however that she was upon the point of being out of the reach of his power, he recovered himself, and pulled her back.</P>
<P>What is in the wind now? Do you think, you nasty strumpet, that you shall get the better of me by sheer impudence? Sit down! rest you satis∣fied!—So you want to know by what right you are here, do you? By the right of possession. This house is mine, and you are in my power. There is no Mrs. Jakeman now to spirit you away; no, nor no Mr. Falkland to bully for you. Damn me, I have countermined you, and blown up all your schemes. Do you think I want any other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight, to punish an audacious rebel like you? Do you think I will be contradicted and opposed for nothing? When did you ever know any body resist my will without being made to repent? And shall I now see myself brow-beaten by a chitty-faced girl? I
<PB N="96" REF="028752_0098_0FDBF05E94724C78"/>
am not come to that neither.—I have not given you a fortune? Damn you, who brought you up? I will make you a bill for clothing and lodging. Do not you know that every creditor has a right to stop his runaway debtor? You may think as you please; but here you are till you marry Grimes. Heaven and earth shall not prevent but I will get the better of your obstinacy yet.</P>
<P>Ungenerous, unmerciful man! and so it is enough for you that I have nobody to defend me! But I am not so helpless as you may imagine. You may imprison my body, but you cannot conquer my mind. Marry Mr. Grimes! And is this the way to bring me to your purpose? Every hardship I suffer puts still farther distant the end for which I am thus unjustly treated. You are not used to have your will contradicted! When did I ever con∣tradict it? And in an affair that is so completely my own concern shall my will go for nothing? Are you not ashamed of laying down this rule for yourself, and suffering no other creature to take the benefit of it? I want nothing of you; how dare you refuse me the privilege of a reasonable being, and deny me to live unmolested in poverty and innocence? What sort of man do you show yourself in this case, you who lay claim to the re∣spect and applause of every one that knows you?</P>
<P>The spirited reproaches of Emily had at first the effect to fill Mr. Tyrrel with astonishment, and make him feel abashed and overawed in the pre∣sence of this unprotected innocent. But his con∣fusion was the result of surprise. When the first emotion wore off, his habitual passion returned. He cursed himself for an ass in being moved be her expostulations, and was ten times more exas∣perated against Emily for daring to talk to him in this provoking language, at a time when she had every thing to fear from his power. His despotic
<PB N="97" REF="028752_0099_0FDBF027D8290730"/>
and unforgiving propensities were stimulated to a degree little short of madness. At the same time his manners, which were gloomy and thoughtful, led him to meditate a variety of schemes for the punishment of her obstinacy. He began to suspect that there was little hope of succeeding by open force; he therefore determined to have recourse to treachery.</P>
<P>He found in Grimes an instrument sufficiently adapted to his purpose. This fellow, who would not perhaps intentionally have hurt a worm, was fitted by the mere coarseness of his perceptions for the perpetration of the greatest injuries. He re∣garded both injury and advantage merely as they related to the gratifications of appetite; and con∣sidered it as an essential part of true wisdom to treat with contempt the effeminacy of those who suffer themselves to be tormented with ideal mis∣fortunes. He conceived that no happier destiny could befal a young woman than to be his wife, and believed that that termination would be an am∣ple compensation for any calamines she might sup∣pose herself to undergo in the interval. He was therefore easily prevailed upon by certain tempta∣tions which Mr. Tyrrel knew how to employ, to take a part in the plot into which Miss Melvile was meant to be betrayed.</P>
<P>Matters being thus prepared, Mr. Tyrrel pro∣ceeded through the means of the jailor, (for the experience he had already had of personal discussion did not incline him to repeat his visits) to play upon the fears of his prisoner. This woman, sometimes under pretence of friendship, and some∣times with open malice, informed Emily from time to time of the preparations that were making for consummating her fate. One day the squire had rode over to look at a neat little farm which was destined for the habitation of the new-married cou∣ple,
<PB N="98" REF="028752_0100_0FDBD6D06D069898"/>
and at another a quantity of live stock and houshold furniture was procured that every thing might be ready for their reception. She then told her of a licence that was bought, a parson in rea∣diness, and a day fixed for the nuptials. When Emily endeavoured, though with increasing mis∣givings, to ridicule these proceedings as absolutely nugatory without her consent, her artful gouver∣nante told her various stories of forced marriages, and assured her that neither protestations, nor silence, nor fainting would be of any avail, either to suspend the ceremony, or to set it aside when once performed.</P>
<P>The situation of Miss Melvile was in an eminent degree pitiable. She had no intercourse but with her persecutors. She had not a human being with whom to consult, and who might afford her the smallest degree of consolation and encouragement. She had courage; but it was neither confirmed nor directed by the dictates of experience▪ It could not therefore be expected to be so inflexible as with better information it would no doubt have been found. She had a clear and noble spirit; but she had some of her sex's errors. Her mind sunk un∣der the uniform terrors with which she was assailed, and her health became visibly impaired.</P>
<P>Her firmness being thus far undermined, Grimes, in pursuance of his instructions, took care in his next interview to throw out an insinuation, that for his own part he never cared much for the match, and, since she was so averse to it, would be very well contented that it should never take place. Emily was rejoiced to find her admirer in so favour∣able a disposition; and earnestly pressed him to give effect to this humane declaration. Her repre∣sentations to him on this subject were full of elo∣quence and energy. Grimes appeared to be moved at the fervency of her manner; but objected the
<PB N="99" REF="028752_0101_0FDBF07104D33EA8"/>
resentment of Mr. Tyrrel and his landlord, who would infallibly ruin him upon the least appearance of backwardness on his part, as poor Hawkins had been ruined before. At length however he sug∣gested a project in consequence of which he might assist her in her escape, without its ever coming to their knowledge, as indeed there was no likelihood their suspicions in this case would fix upon him. To be sure, said he, you have refused me in a dis∣dainful sort of a way, as a man may say. Mayhap you thought I was no better than a brute. But I bear you no malice, and I will show you that I am more kind-hearted than you have been willing to believe. It is a strange sort of a vagary you have taken, to stand in your own light, and disoblige all your friends. But, if you are resolute to be off, do you see, I scorn to be the husband of a lass that is not every bit as willing as I; and so I will even help to put you in a condition to be free and follow your own inclinations.</P>
<P>Emily listened to these suggestions at first with eagerness and approbation. But her fervency was somewhat abated, when they came to discuss the minute parts of the undertaking▪ It was necessary, as Grimes informed her, that her escape should be effected in the dead of the night. He would con∣ceal himself for that purpose in the garden, and be provided with false keys by which to deliver her from her prison These circumstances were by no means adapted to calm her perturbed ima∣gination. To throw herself into the arms of the man, whose intercourse she was employing every method to avoid, and whom under the idea of a partner for life she could least of all men endure, was no doubt an extraordinary proceeding. The attendant circumstances of darkness and solitude aggravated the picture. The situation of Tyrrel Place was uncommonly lonely: it was three miles
<PB N="100" REF="028752_0102_0FDBF029593B59C0"/>
from the nearest village, and no less than seven miles from that in which Mrs. Jakeman's sister re∣sided, into whose protection Miss Melvile was de∣sirous of throwing herself. The ingenuous cha∣racter of Emily did not allow her to suspect Grimes of intending to make an ungenerous and brutal ad∣vantage of these circumstances; but her mind in∣voluntarily revolted against the idea of committing herself alone to the disposal of a man whom she had lately been accustomed to consider as the in∣strument of her treacherous relation.</P>
<P>After having for some time revolved these con∣siderations, she thought of the expedient of desiring Grimes to engage Mrs. Jakeman's sister to wait for her at the outside of the garden. But this Grimes peremptorily refused. He even flew into a passion at the proposal. It showed very little gratitude, to desire him to disclose to other people his concern in this dangerous affair. For his part he was de∣termined in consideration of his own safety never to appear in it to any living soul. If Miss did not believe him, when he made this proposal out of pure good nature, and would not trust him, a single inch, she might even see to the conse∣quences herself. He was resolved to condescend no farther to the whims of a person who in her treatment of him had shown herself as proud as Lucifer himself.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> herself to appease his resentment; but all the eloquence of her new confederate could not prevail upon her instantly to give up her ob∣jection. She desired till the next day to consider of it. The day after was fixed by Mr. Tyrrel for the marriage ceremony. In the mean time she was pestered with intimations in a thousand dif∣ferent forms of the fate that so nearly awaited her. The preparations were so continued, methodical and regular, as to produce in her the most painful
<PB N="101" REF="028752_0103_0FDBF0721303FF08"/>
and aching anxiety. If her heart attained a mo∣ment's intermission upon the subject, her female attendant was sure by some sly hint or sarcastical remark to put a speedy termination to her tran∣quillity. She felt herself, as she afterwards re∣marked, alone, uninstructed, just broken loose as it were from the trammels of infancy, without one single creature to concern himself in her fate. She, who till then had never known <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n enemy, had now for three weeks not seen the glimpse of a human countenance that she had not good reason to consider as wholly estranged to her. She now for the first time experienced the anguish of never having known her parents, and being cast entirely upon the charity of people with whom she had too little equality to hope to receive from them the dues of friendship.</P>
<P>The succeeding night was filled with the most anxious thoughts. When a momentary oblivion stole upon her senses, her distempered imagination conjured up a thousand images of violence and falshood, she saw herself in the hands of her de∣termined enemies, who did not hesitate by the most unintermitted treachery to complete her ruin. Her waking thoughts were not more consoling. The struggle was too great for her constitution. As morning approached, she resolved at all hazards to put herself into the hands of Grimes. This de∣termination was no sooner made, than she felt her heart sensibly lightened. She could not conceive of any purposes of injustice that might not be perpetrated by him with even more security at present than under any change of her situation.</P>
<P>When she communicated her determination to Grimes, it was not possible to say whether he re∣ceived pleasure or pain from the intimation. He smiled indeed, but his smile was accompanied by a certain abrupt ruggedness of countenance, so that
<PB N="102" REF="028752_0104_0FDBF02F427739C0"/>
it might equally well be the smile of sarcasm or of congratulation. He however renewed his assurance of fidelity to his engagements and punctuality of execution. Meanwhile the day was interspersed with nuptial presents and preparations, all indi∣cating the firmness as well as security of the di∣rectors of the scene. Emily had hoped that, as the crisis approached, they might have remitted something of their usual diligence. She was resolved in that case, if a fair opportunity had offered, to give the slip both to her jailors, and to her new and half trusted confederate▪ But, though extremely vigilant for that purpose, she found the execution of this idea impracticable.</P>
<P>At length the night so critical to her happiness approached. The mind of Emily could not fail on this occasion to be extremely agitated. She had first exerted all her perspicacity to elude the vigi∣lance of her attendant. This insolent and un∣feeling tyrant, instead of any relentings, had only sought to make sport of her anxiety. Accordingly in one instance she hid herself, and, suffering Emily to suppose that the coast was clear, met her at the end of the gallery, near the top of the stair∣case. How do you do, my dear? said she, with an insulting tone. And so the little dear thought itself cunning enough to outwit me, did it? Oh, it was a sly little gipsey! Go, go back, love; troop! Emily felt deeply the trick that was played upon her. She sighed, but disdained to return any answer to this low vulgarity. Being once more in her chamber, she sat down in a chair, and re∣mained buried in reverie for more than two hours. After this she went to her drawers, and turned over in a hurrying, confused way her linen and clothes, having in her mind the provision it would be necessary to make for her elopement. Her jailor officiously followed her from place to place
<PB N="103" REF="028752_0105_0FDBF07395822250"/>
and observed what she did for the present in silence. It was now the hour of rest. Good night, child, said this saucy girl, in the act of retiring. It is time to lock up. For the few next hours the time is your own. Make the best use of it! Do'ee think you can creep out at the key hole, lovey? At eight o'clock you see me again. And then, and then, added she, clapping her hands, it is all over. The sun is not surer to rise, than you and your honest man to be made one.</P>
<P>There was something in the tone with which this slut uttered her farewel, that for a moment suggested the question to Emily, What does she mean? Is it possible she should know what has been planned for the few next hours? If she do, what will become of me then? But surely her manner of speaking was very unlike that of de∣tection and reprimand!—With an aching heart she folded up the few necessaries she thought proper to take with her. She then listened with an anxiety that would almost have enabled her to hear the stirring of a leaf. From time to time she thought her ear was struck with the sound of feet; but the treading, if treading it were, was so soft, that she could never ascertain whether it were a real sound or the mere creature of the fancy. Then all was still as if the universal motion had been at rest. By and by she conceived she overheard a noise as of buzzing and low muttered speech. Her heart palpitated; she said, Am I betrayed? Am I the dupe of base artifice and deceit? Presently she heard the sound of a key in her chamber door, and Grimes made his appearance. She started, and cried, Are we discovered? did not I hear you speak? Grimes advanced on tiptoe with his finger to his lip. No, no, replied be, all is safe! He took her by the hand, led her in silence out of the house and then across the garden. Emily ex∣amined
<PB N="104" REF="028752_0106_0FDBF030179AA210"/>
with her eye the doors and passages as they proceeded, looked on all sid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s with fearful suspi∣cion, but every thing was as she herself could have wished. Grimes opened a back <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oor of the gar∣den already unlocked, that led into an unfrequented lane. There stood two horses ready equipped for the journey, their bridles hung to a post not six yards distant from the garden. Grimes pushed the door after them. By Gemini, said he, my heart was in my mouth▪ As I comed along, I saw Mun, coachey, pop along from the back door to the stables. He was within a hop, step, and jump of me. But he had a lanthorn in his hand, and he did not see me, being as I was darkling.—Say∣ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, he assisted Miss Melvile to mount. He troubled her little during the route. On the con∣trary, he was remarkably silent and contemplative, a circumstance by no means disagreeable to Emily, to whom his conversation had never been accept∣able.</P>
<P>After having proceeded about two miles, they turned into a wood, through which the road lay that led to the place of their destination. The night was extremely dark, at the same time that the air was soft and mild, it being now the middle of summer. Under pretence of exploring the way, Grimes contrived, when they had already penetrated into the midst of this gloomy solitude, to get his horse abreast with that of Miss Melvile, and then suddenly reaching out his hand, to seize hold of her bridle. I think we may as well stop here a bit, said he.</P>
<P>Stop, exclaimed Emily with surprise. Why should we stop? Mr. Grimes, what do you mean?</P>
<P>Come, come, said he, never trouble yourself to wonder. Did you think I was such a goose, as to take all this trouble merely to gratify your whim? I' faith, nobody shall find me a pack horse, to go
<PB N="105" REF="028752_0107_0FDBF074442E5BB8"/>
of other folks' errands, without knowing a reason why. I cannot say that I much minded to have you at first; but your ways are enough to stir the blood of my grandad. Far fetched and dear bought is always relishing. Your consent was so hard to gain, that squire thought it was surest asking in the dark. A' said however a' would have no such doings in his house, and so, do you see? we are comed here.</P>
<P>For God's sake, Mr. Grimes, think what you are about! You cannot be base enough to ruin a poor creature who has put herself under your pro∣tection!</P>
<P>That is all bother. Ruin! no, no, I will make an honest woman of you, when all is done. Nay, none of your airs; no tricks upon travellers! I have you here as safe as a horse in a pound; there is not a house nor a shed within a mile of us; and, if I miss the opportunity, you shall call me spade. Faith, you are a delicate morsel, and there is no time to be lost!</P>
<P>Miss Melvile had but an instant in which to col∣lect her thoughts. She felt that there was but little hope of softening the obstinate and insensible brute in whose power she was placed. But the presence of mind and intrepidity, so peculiar to her character, did not now desert her. Grimes had scarcely finished his harangue, when with a strong and unexpected jerk she disengaged the bridle from his grasp, and at the same time put her horse upon full speed. She had scarcely advanced twice the length of her horse, when Grimes re∣covered from his surprise, and pursued her, inex∣pressibly mortified at being so easily overreached. The sound of his horse behind served but to rouse more completely the mettle of that of Emily; whether by accident or sagacity the animal pursued
<PB N="106" REF="028752_0108_0FDBF036D3149CF0"/>
without a fault the narrow and winding way; and the chace continued the whole length of the wood.</P>
<P>At the extremity of this wood there was a gate. The recollection of this softened a little the cutting disappointment of Grimes, as he thought himself secure of putting an end by its assistance to the career of Emily, nor was it very probable that they should find any body to interrupt him there in the dead and silence of the night. By the most extraordinary accident however they sound a man on horseback in wait at this gate. Help, help! exclaimed the affrighted Emily! thieves! murder! help! The man was Mr. Falkland. Grimes knew his voice, and therefore, though he attempted a sort of sullen resistance, it was feebly made. Two other men, whom by reason of the darkness he had not at first seen, and who were Mr. Falkland's servants, hearing the bustle of the rencounter, and alarmed for the safety of their master, rode up; and then Grimes, disappointed at the loss of his gratification, and admonished by conscious guilt, shrunk from farther parley and rode off in silence.</P>
<P>It may seem strange that Mr. Falkland should thus a second time have been the saviour of Miss Melvile, and that under circumstances the most unexpected and singular. But in this instance it is very easily to be accounted for. He had heard of a man who lurked about this wood for robbery or some other bad design, and that it was conjectured this man was Hawkins. Mr. Falkland's compassion had already been strongly interested in behalf of this victim of rural tyranny; he had in vain en∣deavoured to find him, and do him good; and he easily conceived that, if the conjecture which had been made in this instance proved true, he might have it in his power not only to do what he had always intended, but farther to save from a peril∣ous offence against the laws <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> society a man who
<PB N="107" REF="028752_0109_0FDBF076F73F3428"/>
appeared to have strongly imbibed the principles of justice and virtue. He took with him two ser∣vants, because, going with the express design of encountering robbers, if robbers should be found, he believed he should be inexcusable if he did not go provided against possible accidents. But he had directed them, at the same time that they kept within call, to be out of the reach of being seen; and it was only the eagerness of their zeal that had brought them up thus early in the present encoun∣ter. Mr. Falkland had a little before had the op∣portunity to convince himself that the village con∣jecture in relation to Hawkins was untrue; and was now upon the point of returning home, with no other satisfaction than that of having intended an act of benevolence, when Grimes and Emily came up to the spot upon which he had posted himself.</P>
<P>This new adventure promised something extra∣ordinary. Mr. Falkland did not immediately re∣cognise Miss Melvile, and the person of Grimes was that of a total stranger whom he did not re∣collect to have ever seen. But it was easy to un∣derstand the merits of the case, and the propriety of interfering. The resolute manner of Mr. Falk∣land, combined with the dread which Grimes, op∣pressed with a sense of wrong, entertained of the opposition of so elevated a personage, speedily put the ravisher to flight. Emily was lest alone with her deliverer. He found her much more collected and calm than could reasonably have been expected from a person who had been a moment before in the most alarming situation. She told him of the place to which she desired to be conveyed, and he immediately undertook to escort her. As they went along, she recovered that state of mind which inclined her to make a person to whom she had such repeated obligations, and who was so emi∣nently
<PB N="108" REF="028752_0110_0FDBF0385351B1A8"/>
the object of her admiration, acquainted with the events that had recently befallen her. Mr. Falkland listened with eagerness and surprise. Though he had already known various instances of Mr. Tyrrel's mean jealousy and unfeeling tyranny, this surpassed them all, and he could scarcely credit his ears while he heard the tale. His brutal neigh∣bour seemed to realise all that had ever been told of the passions of fiends. Miss Melvile was obliged to repeat in the course of her tale her kinsman's rude accusation against her of entertaining a pas∣sion for Mr. Falkland; and this she did with the most bewitching simplicity and charming confusion. Though this part of the tale was a source of real pain to her deliverer, yet it is not to be supposed but that the flattering partiality of this unhappy girl increased the interest he felt in her welfare and the indignation he conceived against her in∣fernal kinsman.</P>
<P>They arrived without accident at the house of the good lady under whose protection Emily de∣sired to place herself. Here Mr. Falkland willingly left her as in a place of security. Such conspira∣cies as that of which she was intended to have been the victim, depend for their success upon the person against whom they are formed being out of the reach of help, and the moment they are de∣tected they are annihilated. Such reasoning will no doubt be generally found sufficiently solid, and it appeared to Mr. Falkland perfectly applicable to the present case. But he was mistaken.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<P>MR. TYRREL heard with astonishment of the miscarriage of an expedient, of the success of which he had not previously entertained the slightest suspicion. He became frantic with vexation. Grimes had not dared to signify the event of his expedition in person, and the footman whom he desired to announce to his master that Miss Mel∣vile was lost, the moment after fled from his pre∣sence with the most dreadful apprehensions. Pre∣sently he bellowed for Grimes, and the young man at last appeared before him, more dead than alive. Grimes he compelled to repeat the particulars of the tale, which he had no sooner done than he once again slunk away, shocked at the execrations with which Mr. Tyrrel overwhelmed him. Grimes was no coward; but he reverenced the inborn divinity that attends upon rank, as Indians worship the devil. Nor was this all. The rage of Mr. Tyrrel was so ungovernable and fierce, that few hearts could have been found so stout as not to have trembled before it with a sort of unconquer∣able inferiority.</P>
<P>He no sooner obtained a moment's pause than he began to recal to his tempestuous mind the various circumstances of the case. His complaints were bitter; and in a tranquil observer might have produced the united feeling of pity for his suffer∣ings and horror at his depravity. He recollected all the precautions he had used; he could scarcely find a flaw in the process; and he cursed that blind and malicious power that delighted to cross his most deep laid designs. Of this malice he was
<PB N="110" REF="028752_0112_0FDBF03C795DAF28"/>
beyond all other human beings the object. He was mocked with the shadow of power; and, when he lifted his hand to smite, it was struck with sudden palsy. To what purpose had heaven given him a feeling of injury and an instinct to resent, while he could in no case make his resent∣ment felt! It was only necessary for him to be the enemy of any person, in order to that person's being insured against the reach of misfortune. What insults, the most shocking and repeated, had he not received from this paltry girl? And by whom was she now torn from his indignation? By that devil that haunted him at every moment, that crossed him at every step, that fixed at pleasure his arrows in his heart, and made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ows and mockery at his insufferable tortures.</P>
<P>There was one other reflexion that increased his anguish, and made him careless and desperate as to his future conduct. It was in vain to conceal from himself that his reputation would be cruelly wounded by this event. He had imagined that, while Emily was forced into this odious marriage, she would be obliged by decorum, as soon as the event was decided, to draw a veil over the com∣pulsion she had suffered. But this security was now lost, and Mr. Falkland would take a pride in publishing his dishonour. Though the provoca∣tions he had received from Miss Melvile would in his opinion have justified him in any treatment he should have thought proper to inflict, he was sensi∣ble the world would see the matter in a very dif∣ferent light. This reflection augmented the vio∣lence of his resolutions, and determined him to refuse no means by which he could transfer the anguish that now preyed upon his own mind to that of another.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the composure and magnanimity of Emily had considerably subsided, the moment she
<PB N="111" REF="028752_0113_0FDBF0799DAC38D0"/>
believed herself in a place of safety. While dan∣ger and injustice assailed her with their menaces, she found in herself a courage that disdained to yield. The succeeding appearance of calm was more fatal to her. There was nothing now power∣fully to foster her courage, or excite her energy. She looked back at the trials she had passed, and her soul sickened at the recollection of that which, while it was in act, she had had the fortitude to endure. Till the period at which Mr. Tyrrel had been inspired with this cruel antipathy, she had been in all instances a stranger to anxiety and fear. Uninured to misfortune, she had suddenly and without preparation been made the subject of the most infernal malignity. When a man of robust and vigorous constitution has a fit of sickness, it produces a much more powerful effect than the same indisposition upon a delicate valetudinarian. Such was the case with Miss Melvile. She passed the succeeding night sleepless and uneasy, and was found in the morning with a high fever. Her distemper resisted for the present all attempts to assuage it, though there was reason to hope that the goodness of her constitution, assisted by tran∣quillity and the kindness of those about her, would ultimately surmount it. On the second day she was delirious. On the night of that day she was ar∣rested at the suit of Mr. Tyrrel for a debt contract∣ed for board and necessaries for the fourteen last years.</P>
<P>The idea of this arrest, as the reader will per∣haps recollect, first occurred in the conversation between Mr. Tyrrel and Miss Melvile soon after he had thought proper to confine her to her cham∣ber. But at that time he had probably had no serious conception of ever being induced to carry it into execution. It had merely been mentioned by way of threat, and as the suggestion of a mind whose
<PB N="112" REF="028752_0114_0FDBF03D95E62BB0"/>
habits had been long familiarised to the recollection of every possible medium of tyranny and revenge. But now that the unlooked-for rescue and escape of his poor kinswoman had wrought up the thoughts of Mr. Tyrrel to a degree of insanity, and he re∣volved in the gloomy resources of his mind how he might most effectually shake off the load of disap∣pointment that oppressed him, the idea recurred with double force. He was not long in forming his resolution; and, calling for Barnes, his steward, immediately gave him directions in what manner to proceed.</P>
<P>Barnes had been for several years the instrument of Mr. Tyrrel's injustice. His mind was hardened by use, and he could without remorse officiate as the spectator, or even as the immediate author and director of a scene of vulgar distress. But even he was somewhat startled upon the present occasion. The character and conduct of Emily in Mr. Tyrrel's family had been without a blot. She had not a single enemy; and it was impossible to contemplate her youth, her harmless vivacity, her guileless innocence, without emotions of sympathy and compassion.</P>
<P>Your worship?—I do not understand you!—Arrest miss!—miss Emily!</P>
<P>Yes, I tell you! What is the matter with you? Go immediately to Swineard, the lawyer, and bid him finish the business out of hand!</P>
<P>Lord love your honour! Arrest her! Why, she does not owe you a brass farthing; she always lived upon your charity!</P>
<P>Ass! Scoundrel! I tell you she does owe me, owes me—eleven hundred pound.—The law justi∣fies it.—What do you think laws were made for?—I do nothing but right, and my rights I will have.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="028752_0115_0FDBF08065735760"/>
Your honour, I never questioned your orders in my life; but I must now. I cannot see you ruin miss Emily, poor girl! nay, and yourself too, for the matter of that, and not say which way you are going. I hope you will bear with me. Why if she owed you ever so much, she cannot be ar∣rested. She is not of age.</P>
<P>Will you have done, sir? Do not tell me of It cannot▪ and It can. To my knowledge it has been done before, and it shall be done again. Let him dispute it that dares. I will do it now, and stand to it afterwards. Tell Swineard, if he make the least boggling, it is as much as his life is worth; he shall starve by inches.</P>
<P>Pray, your honour, think better of it. Upon my life, the whole country will cry shame of it.</P>
<P>Barnes?—What do you mean? I am not used to be talked to, and I will not bear it!—They have driven me already with their parleying and their disobedience to the very end of my patience. You have been a good fellow to me upon many occasions. But, if I find you out for making one with them that dispute my authority, damn my soul, if I do not make you sick of your very life!</P>
<P>I have done, your honour. I will not say ano∣ther word, except this. I have heard as how that miss Emily is sick a-bed. You are determined, you say, to put her in jail. You do not mean to kill her, I take it.</P>
<P>Let her die, if she will! I will not spare her for an hour. I will not always be insulted. She had no consideration for me, and I have no mercy for her. I am in for it! They have provoked me past all bearing, and they shall feel me! Tell Swineard, in bed or up, day or night, I will not have him hear of a minute's delay.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="028752_0116_0FDBF03F1B77C4D0"/>
Such were the directions of Mr. Tyrrel, and in strict conformity to his directions were the pro∣ceedings of that respectable limb of the law he em∣ployed upon the present occasion. Miss Melvile had been delirious through a considerable part of the day on the evening of which the bailiff and his follower arrived. By the direction of the physician whom Mr. Falkland had ordered to attend her, a composing draught was administered; and, ex∣hausted as she was by the wild and distracted images that for several hours had haunted her fancy, she was now sunk into a refreshing slumber. Mrs. Hammond, the sister of Mrs. Jakeman, was sitting by her bed-side, full of compassion for the lovely sufferer, and rejoicing in the calm tranquillity that had just taken possession of her, when a little girl, the only child of Mrs. Hammond, opened the street-door to the tap of the bailiff. He said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e wanted to speak with miss Melvile, and the child answered that she would go tell her mother. So saying, she advanced to the door of the back-room upon the ground-floor in which Emily lay; but the moment it was opened, instead of waiting for the appearance of the mother, the bailiff entered along with the girl.</P>
<P>Mrs. Hammond looked up. Who are you, said she? Why do you come in here? Hush! be quiet!</P>
<P>I must speak with miss Melvile.</P>
<P>Indeed, but you must not. Tell me your busi∣ness. The poor lady has been light-headed all day. She is just fallen asleep, and must not be disturbed.</P>
<P>That is no business of mine. I must obey orders.</P>
<P>Orders? Whose orders? What is it you mean?</P>
<P>At this moment Emily opened her eyes. What noise is that? I wish you would let me be quiet.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="028752_0117_0FDBF081D6588520"/>
Miss, I want to speak with you. I have got a writ against you for eleven hundred pound at the suit of squire Tyrrel.</P>
<P>At these words both Mrs. Hammond and Emily were dumb. The latter was scarcely able to annex any meaning to the intelligence; and, though Mrs. Hammond was somewhat better acquainted with the sort of language that was employed, yet in this strange and unexpected connexion it was almost as mysterious to her, as to poor Emily herself.</P>
<P>A writ! How can she be in Mr. Tyrrel's debt? A writ against a child!</P>
<P>It is no signification putting your questions to us. We only do as we are directed. There is our au∣thority. Look at it.</P>
<P>Lord Almighty! exclaimed Mrs. Hammond, what does this mean? It is impossible Mr. Tyrrel should have sent you.</P>
<P>Good woman, none of your jabber to us! Can∣not you read?</P>
<P>This is all a trick! This paper is forged! It is a vile contrivance to get the poor lady out of the hands of those with whom only she can be safe. Proceed upon it at your peril!</P>
<P>Rest you content; that is exactly what we mean to do. Take it at my word, we know very well what we are about.</P>
<P>Why, you would not tear her from her bed? I tell you, she is in a high fever; she is light-headed; it would be death to remove her! You are bailiffs, are not you? You are not murderers?</P>
<P>The law says nothing about that. We have or∣ders to take her sick or well. We will do her no harm; except so far as we must perform our office, be it how it will.</P>
<P>Where would you take her? What is it you mean to do?</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="028752_0118_0FDBF04352B29F00"/>
To the county jail. Bullock, go, order a post-chaise from the Griffin!</P>
<P>Stay, I say! Give no such orders! Wait only three hours; I will send off a messenger express to squire Falkland, and I am sure he will sa∣tisfy you as to any harm that can come to you, without its being necessary to take the poor lady to jail.</P>
<P>We have particular directions against that. We are not at liberty to lose a minute. Why are not you gone? Order the horses to be put to imme∣diately!</P>
<P>Emily had listened to the course of this conver∣sation, which had sufficiently explained to her whatever was enigmatical at the first appearance of the bailiffs. The painful and incredible reality that was thus presented, effectually dissipated the illu∣sions of frenzy to which she had just been a prey. My dear madam, said she to Mrs. Hammond, do not harass yourself with useless efforts. I am very sorry for all the trouble I have given you. But my misfortune is inevitable. Sir, if you will step into the next room, I will dress myself, and attend you immediately.</P>
<P>Mrs. Hammond began to be equally aware that her struggles were to no purpose; but she could not be equally patient. At one moment she raved upon the brutality of Mr. Tyrrel, whom she affirm∣ed to be a devil incarnate, and not a man. At another she expostulated with bitter invective against the hard-heartedness of the bailiff, and ex∣horted him to mix some humanity and moderation with the discharge of his duty; but he was impe∣netrable to all she could urge. In the mean while Emily yielded with the sweetest resignation to an inevitable evil. Mrs. Hammond insisted that at least they should permit her to attend her young lady in the chaise; and the bailiff, though the or∣ders
<PB N="117" REF="028752_0119_0FDBF08762EE17C8"/>
he had received were so peremptory that he dared not exercise his discretion as to the execution of the writ, began to have some apprehensions of danger, and was willing to admit of any precau∣tion that was not in direct hostility to his func∣tions. For the rest he understood, that it was in all cases dangerous to allow sickness, or apparent unfitness for removal as a sufficient cause to inter∣rupt a direct process, and that accordingly in all doubtful questions and presumptive murders the practice of the law inclined [with a laudable par∣tiality] to the vindication of its own officers. In addition to these general rules he was influenced by the positive injunctions and assurances of Swine∣ard, and the terror which universally through a circle of many miles was annexed to the name of Tyrrel. Before they departed Mrs. Hammond dis∣patched a messenger with a letter of three lines to Mr. Falkland informing him of this extraordinary event. Mr. Falkland was from home when the messenger arrived, and not expected to return till the second day; accident seeming in this instance to favour the vengeance of Mr. Tyrrel, for he had himself been too much under the dominion of an uncontroulable fury to have leisure to take a cir∣cumstance of this sort into his estimate.</P>
<P>The forlorn state of these poor women, who were conducted, the one by compulsion, the other as a volunteer, to a scene so little adapted to their accommodation as that of a common jail, may easily be imagined. There were however a mascu∣line courage and impetuosity of spirit in Mrs. Hammond, eminently necessary in the difficulties they had to encounter. She was in some degree sitted by a sanguine temper and an impassioned sense of injustice for the discharge of those very offices which sobriety and calm reflexion might prescribe. The health of miss Melvile, as might
<PB N="118" REF="028752_0120_0FDBF044528B19D0"/>
have been expected, was very materially affected by the surprise and removal she had undergone, at the very time when repose was most necessary for her preservation. Her fever became more violent than ever; her delirium was stronger; and the tor∣tures of her imagination were in some degree pro∣portioned to the extreme unfavourableness of the state in which the removal had been effected. It was highly improbable she could at all recover.</P>
<P>In the moments of suspended reason she was perpetually calling on the name of Mr. Falkland. Mr. Falkland, she said, was her first and only love, and he should be her husband. A moment after∣wards she exclaimed upon him in a disconsolate, yet reproachful tone, for his unworthy deference to the prejudices of the world. It was very cruel of him to shew himself so proud, and tell her that he would never consent to marry a beggar. But, if he were proud, she was determined to be proud too. He should see that she would not demean herself like a slighted maiden, and that, though he could reject her, it was not in his power to break her heart. At another time she imagined she saw Mr. Tyrrel and his engine Grimes, their hands and garments dropping with blood, and the pathetic reproaches she vented against them might have af∣fected a heart of stone. Then the figure of Falk∣land presented itself to her distracted fancy, de∣formed with wounds and of a deadly paleness, and she shrieked with agony, while she exclaimed that such was the general hard-heartedness, that no one would make the smallest exertion for his rescue. In such vicissitudes of pain, perpetually imagining to herself unkindness, insult, conspiracy and murder, she passed a considerable part of two days.</P>
<P>On the evening of the second Mr. Falkland ar∣rived, accompanied by doctor Arnold, the physi∣cian by whom she had previously been attended.
<PB N="119" REF="028752_0121_0FDBF08954C18D88"/>
The scene he was called upon to witness was such as to be most exquisitely agonizing to a man of his acute sensibility. The news of the arrest had given him an inexpressible shock; he was transported out of himself at the unexampled malignity of its author. But, when he saw the figure of Miss Melvile, haggard, and a warrant of death written in her countenance, a victim to the diabolical pas∣sions of her kinsman, the scene seemed too much to be endured. When he entered, she was in the midst of one of her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>its of delirium, and immedi∣ately mistook her visitors for two assassins. She asked, where they had hid her Falkland, her lord, her life, her husband! and demanded that they should restore to her his mangled corpse, that she might embrace him with her dying arms, breathe her last upon his lips, and be buried in the same grave. She reproached them with the sordidness of their conduct in becoming the tools of her vile cousin, who had deprived her of her reason, and would never be contented, till he had murdered her. Mr. Falkland tore himself away from this painful scene, and, leaving doctor Arnold with his patient, desired him when he had given the necessary di∣rections to follow him to his inn.</P>
<P>The perpetual hurry of spirits in which Miss Melvile had for several days been kept by the na∣ture of her indisposition was extremely exhausting to her; and in about an hour from the visit of Mr. Falkland her delirium subsided, and left her in so low a state as to render it difficult to perceive any marks of life. Doctor Arnold, who had before withdrawn, to soothe, if possible, the disturbed and impatient thoughts of Mr. Falkland, was sum∣moned afresh upon this change of symptoms, and sat by the bed-side during <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> remainder of the night. The situation of his patient was such as to keep him in momentary apprehension of her de∣cease.
<PB N="120" REF="028752_0122_0FDBF0493A8EF780"/>
While Miss Melvile lay in this feeble and exhausted condition, Mrs. Hammond betrayed every token of the tenderest, anxiety. Her sensi∣bility was habitually of the acutest sort, and the qualities of Emily were such as powerfully to fix her affection. She loved her like a mother, Upon the present occasion every sound, every motion made her tremble. Doctor Arnold had introduced another nurse in consideration of the incessant fa∣tigue Mrs. Hammond had undergone; and he en∣deavoured by representations and even by autho∣rity to compel her to quit the apartment of the pa∣tient. But she was uncontroulable; and he at length found that he should probably do her more injury by the violence that would be necessary to separate her from the suffering innocent, than by allowing her to follow her own inclinations. Her eye was a thousand times turned with the most eager curiosity upon the countenance of doctor Arnold, without her daring to breathe a question respecting his opinion, lest he should answer her by a communication of the most fatal tidings. In the mean time she listened with the deepest atten∣tion to every thing that dropped either from the physician or the nurse, hoping as it were to collect from some oblique hint the intelligence which she had not courage expressly to require.</P>
<P>Towards morning the state of the patient seemed to take a favourable turn. She dozed for near two hours, and, when she awoke, appeared perfectly calm and sensible. Understanding that Mr. Falk∣land had brought the physician to attend her, and was himself in the neighbourhood, she requested to see him. Mr. Falkland had gone in the mean time with one of his tenants to bail the debt, and now entered the prison to enquire whether the young lady might be safely removed from her present mi∣serable residence to a more airy and commodious
<PB N="121" REF="028752_0123_0FDBF08D751E6F38"/>
apartment. When he appeared, the sight of him revived in the mind of Miss Melvile an imperfect rencollection of the wanderings of her delirium. She covered her face with her hand, and betrayed the most expressive confusion, while she thanked him with her usual unaffected simplicity for all the trouble he had taken. She hoped she should not give him much more; she thought she should get better. It was a shame, she said, if a young and lively girl as she was, could not contrive to outlive the trifling misfortunes to which she had been sub∣jected. But, while she said this, she was still ex∣tremely weak. She tried to assume a chearful countenance; but it was a faint effort, which the feeble state of her frame did not seem sufficient to support. Mr. Falkland and the doctor joined to request her to keep herself quiet, and to avoid for the present all occasions of exertion.</P>
<P>Encouraged by these appearances, Mrs. Ham∣mond now ventured to follow the two gentlemen out of the room in order to learn from the physi∣cian what hopes he entertained. Doctor Arnold acknowledged that he had found his patient at first in a very unfavourable situation, that the symptoms were changed for the better, and that he was not without some expectation of her recovery. He added however, that he could answer for nothing, that the next twelve hours would be exceedingly critical, but that, if she did not grow worse be∣fore morning, he would then undertake to answer for her life. Mrs. Hammond, who had hitherto seen nothing but despair, now became frantic with joy. She burst into tears of transport, blessed the physician in the most emphatic and impassioned terms, and uttered a thousand extravagancies. Doctor Arnold seized this opportunity to press her to give herself a little repose, to which she consent∣ed, a chamber being first procured for her next to
<PB N="122" REF="028752_0124_0FDBF04B14B61FC0"/>
that of Miss Melvile, and she having charged the nurse to give her notice of any alteration in the patient.</P>
<P>Mrs. Hammond enjoyed an uninterrupted sleep of several hours, when towards the afternoon, she was alarmed by an unusual bustle in the next room. She listened for a few moments, and then deter∣mined to go and see what was the occasion of it. As she opened her door for that purpose, she met the nurse who was coming to her. The counte∣nance of the messenger told her what it was she had to communicate, without the use of words. She hurried to the bed side, and found Miss Mel∣vile expiring. The appearances that had at first been so encouraging were but of short duration. The calm of the morning proved to be only a sort of lightning before death. In a few hours the patient grew worse. The bloom of her counte∣nance faded; she drew her breath with difficulty; and her eyes became fixed. Doctor Arnold had come in at this period, and had immediately per∣ceived that all was over. She was for some time in convulsions; but, these subsiding, she addressed the physician with a composed, though feeble voice. She thanked him for his attention; and expressed the most lively sense of her obligations to Mr. Falkland. She sincerely forgave her cousin, and hoped he might never be visited by too acute a recollection of his barbarity to her. She would have been contented to live; few persons had a sincerer relish of the good things of life; but she was well pleased to die rather than have become the wife of Grimes. As Mrs. Hammond entered, she turned her countenance towards her, and with an affectionate expression repeated her name. These were her last words; in less than two hours from that time she breathed her last in the arms of this faithful friend.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<P>SUCH was the fate of Miss Emily Melvile. Perhaps tyranny never exhibited a more painful memorial of the detestation in which it deserves to be held. The idea irresistibly excited in every spectator of the scene was that of regarding Mr. Tyrrel as the most diabolical wretch that had ever dishonoured the human form. The very attendants upon this house of oppression, for the scene was acted upon too public a stage not to be generally understood, expressed their astonishment and dis∣gust at his unparalleled cruelty. If such were the feelings of men bred to the commission of injustice, it is easy to conceive what must have been those of Mr. Falkland. His whole life had tended to culti∣vate in him a mind tremblingly alive to moral good and evil. Upon such occasions he was unable ma∣turely to collect his thoughts and firmly resolve upon the proceeding which the nature of the case required. His habits urged him to madness and ungovernable fury. He could not think of such complicated depravity but with sentiments of pre∣ternatural loathing and horror. Perhaps the ago∣nies of the wretch broken upon the wheel, whom the very first sight of that engine of torture had thrown into convulsions, did not exceed those of Mr. Falkland in the present situation. He was therefore deprived for a time of all that composure of mind which is requisite to enable us to act with discretion. It was necessary to guard him like a madman. The whole office of judging what was
<PB N="124" REF="028752_0126_0FDBF05189AC70C0"/>
proper to be done under the present circumstances devolved upon doctor Arnold.</P>
<P>The doctor was a man of cool and methodical habits of acting. One of the first ideas that sug∣gested itself to him was, that Miss Melvile was a branch of the family of Tyrrel. He did not doubt of the willingness of Mr. Falkland to dis∣charge every expence that might be farther incident to the melancholy remains of this unfortunate victim; but he suspected that the laws of fashion and decorum required that some notification of the event should be made to the head of the family▪ His manners were formal, his temper phlegmatic, and his whole character was such as to render him little susceptible of those impetuous impulses which have so considerable a share in the history of the mass of mankind. Perhaps too he had an eye to his own interest in his profession, and was reluc∣tant to expose himself to the resentment of a per∣son of Mr. Tyrrel's consideration in the neighbour∣hood. Inaccessible to the sympathies of the mind, he was little qualified to calculate their operation in the present instance. But, with this weakness, he had nevertheless some feelings in common with the rest of the world, and must have suffered a con∣siderable degree of violence before he could have persuaded himself to be the messenger; beside which he did not think it right in the present situ∣ation to leave Mr. Falkland.</P>
<P>Doctor Arnold no sooner mentioned these ideas, than they seemed to make a sudden impression on Mrs. Hammond, and she earnestly requested that she might be permitted to carry the intelligence. The proposal was unexpected; but the doctor did not very obstinately refuse his assent. She was de∣termined, she said, to see what sort of impression the catastrophe would make upon the author of it; and she promised to comport herself with modera∣tion and civility. The journey was soon per∣formed.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="028752_0127_0FDBF0941E2C0790"/>
I am come, sir, said she to Mr. Tyrrel, to in∣form you that your cousin, Miss Melvile, died this afternoon.</P>
<P>Died! Is it possible? are you serious?</P>
<P>Yes, sir. I saw her die. She died in my arms.</P>
<P>Dead! Who killed her? What do you mean?</P>
<P>Who killed her? Is it for you to ask that question? It was your cruelty and malice that killed her?</P>
<P>Me?—my?—Poh! she is not dead—it cannot be—it is not a week since she left this house.</P>
<P>Will you not believe me? I say she is dead!</P>
<P>Have a care, woman! this is no jesting matter. No: though she used me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll, I would not believe her dead for all the world!</P>
<P>Mrs. Hammond shook her head in token of the truth of her assertion.</P>
<P>No, no, no, no!—I will never believe that!—No, never!</P>
<P>Will you come with me, and convince your own eyes? It is a sight worthy of you, and will be a feast to such a heart as yours!—Saying this, Mrs. Hammond offered her hand, as if to conduct him to the spot.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel shrunk back.</P>
<P>If she be dead, what is that to me? Am I to answer for every thing that goes wrong in the world?—What do you come here for? Why bring your messages to me?</P>
<P>To whom should I bring them, but to her kins∣man,—and her murderer?</P>
<P>Murderer!—Did I employ knives or pistols? Did I give her poison? I did nothing but what the law allows. If she be dead, nobody can say that I am to blame!</P>
<P>To blame!—All the world will abhor and curse you. Were you such a fool as to think, because in some cases men pay respect to wealth and rank,
<PB N="126" REF="028752_0128_0FDBF05291E46608"/>
that this excuse would extend to such a deed? They will laugh at so barefaced a cheat. The meanest beggar will spurn and spit at you. Aye▪ you may well stand confounded at what you have done. I will proclaim you to the whole world, and you will be obliged to fly the very face of a human creature!</P>
<P>Good woman, said Mr. Tyrrel, extremely hum∣bled, talk no more in this strain!—Emmy is not dead! I am sure—I hope—she is not dead!—Tell me that you have only been deceiving me, and I will forgive you every thing.—I will forgive her—I will take her into favour—I will do any thing you please!—I never meant her any harm!</P>
<P>I tell you, sir, she is dead! You have murdered the sweetest lady that lived! Can you bring her back to life, as you have driven her out of it? If you could, I would kneel to you twenty times a day!—What is it you have done? Miserable wretch! did you think you could do and undo, and change the laws of nature, as you please?</P>
<P>If she is dead,—what care I? It is no concern of mine. Did I tell her to run away? I meant every thing for her good. If she took things to heart so, as to die of the pip like a chicken, is that my fault?</P>
<P>The reproaches of Mrs. Hammond were the first instance in which Mr. Tyrrel was made to drink the full cup of retribution. This was however only a specimen of a long series of contempt, ab∣horrence and insult that was reserved for him. The words of Mrs. Hammond were prophetic. It evidently appeared that, though wealth and here∣ditary elevation operate as an apology for many delinquencies, there are some which so irresistibly address themselves to the indignation of mankind, that, like death, they level all distinctions, and reduce their perpetrator to an equality with the
<PB N="127" REF="028752_0129_0FDBF0961380C088"/>
most indigent and squalid of his species. Against Mr. Tyrrel, as the tyrannical and unmanly mur∣derer of Emily, those who dared not venture the unreserved avowal of their sentiments, muttered curses, deep, not loud; while the rest joined in an universal cry of abhorrence and execration. He himself stood astonished at the novelty of his situ∣ation. Accustomed as he had been to the obe∣dience and trembling homage of mankind, he had imagined they would be perpetual, and that no excess on his part would ever be potent enough to break the enchantment. Now he looked round and saw sullen detestation in every face, which with difficulty restrained itself, and upon the slight∣est provocation broke forth with an impetuous tide, and swept away all the mounds of subordi∣nation and fear. His large estate could not n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w purchase civility from the gentry, the peasantry, scarcely from his own servants. In the indignation of all around him he found a ghost that haunted him with every change of place, and a remorse that stung his conscience and exterminated his peace. The neighbourhood appeared more and more every day to be growing too hot for him to endure the fierceness of its temperature, and it became evident that he would ultimately be obliged to quit the country. Urged by the flagitiousness of this last example, people learned to recollect every other instance of Mr. Tyrrel's excesses, and upon the whole it was no doubt a fearful cata∣logue of wanton injustice that now rose up in judgment against him. It seemed as if the sense of public resentment had been long gathering strength unperceived, and now at length burst forth into inextinguishable violence.</P>
<P>There was scarcely a human being upon whom this sort of retribution could have sat more un∣easily than upon Mr. Tyrrel. Though he had not
<PB N="128" REF="028752_0130_0FDBF056D6014148"/>
a consciousness of innocence prompting him con∣tinually to recoil from the detestation of mankind as a thing totally unallied to his character, yet the imperiousness of his temper and the constant ex∣perience he had had of the pliability of other men, prepared him to feel the general and undisguised condemnation into which he was sunk with un∣common emotions of anger and impatience. That he, at the beam of whose eye every countenance fell, and whom in the fierceness of his wrath no one was daring enough to answer, should now be regarded with avowed dislike and treated with un∣ceremonious censure, was a thing he could not endure to recollect or believe. Symptoms of the universal disgust smote him at every instant, and at every blow he writhed with intolerable anguish. His rage was unbounded and raving. He repelled every attack with the fiercest indignation; while the more he struggled, the more desperate his situ∣ation appeared to become. At length he deter∣mined to collect his strength for a decisive effort, and to meet the whole tide of public opinion in a single scene.</P>
<P>In pursuance of these thoughts he resolved to repair without delay to the rural assembly which I have already mentioned in the course of my history. Miss Melvile had now been dead one month. There was a sort of bustle that took place at his entrance, it having been agreed by a private vote among the gentlemen of the assembly that Mr. Tyrrel was to be refused admittance, as a person with whom they did not choose to associate. This vote had already been notified to him by letter by the master of the ceremonies, but the intelligence was rather calculated to a man of Mr. Tyrrel's disposition to excite defiance than to overawe. At the door of the assembly he was personally met by the master of the ceremonies, who had perceived
<PB N="129" REF="028752_0131_0FDBF09C18148D00"/>
the arrival of an equipage, and who now endea∣voured to repeat his prohibition; but he was thrust aside by Mr. Tyrrel with an air of native autho∣rity and ineffable contempt. As he entered, every eye was turned upon him. Presently all the gen∣tlemen in the room assembled round him. Some endeavored to hustle him, and others began to expostulate. But he found the secret effectually to silence the one set, and to shake off the other. His muscular form, the well-known eminence of his intellectual powers, the long habits to which every man was formed of acknowledging his as∣cendancy, were all in his favour. He considered himself as playing a desperate stake, and had roused all the energies he possessed to enable him to do justice to so interesting a transaction. Disengaged from the insects that had at first pestered him, he paced up and down the room with a magisterial stride, and flashed an angry glance on every side. He then broke silence. "If any one had any thing to say to him, he should know where and how to answer him. He would advise any such person however to consider well what he was about. If any man imagined he had any thing personally to complain of, it was very well. But he did expect that nobody there would be igno∣rant and raw enough to meddle with what was no business of theirs, and intrude into the concerns of any man's private family".</P>
<P>This being a sort of defiance, one and another gentleman advanced to answer it. He that was first began to speak; but Mr. Tyrrel, by the ex∣pression of his countenance and a peremptory tone, by well-timed interruptions and pertinent insinu∣ations, caused him first to hesitate, and then to be silent. He seemed to be fast advancing to the triumph he had promised himself. The whole company were astonished. They felt the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame ab∣horrence
<PB N="130" REF="028752_0132_0FDBF057D67F8D50"/>
and condemnation of his character; but they could not help admiring the courage and re∣sources he displayed upon the present occasion. They could without difficulty have concentred afresh their indignant feelings, but they seemed to want a leader.</P>
<P>At this critical moment Mr. Falkland entered the room. He had been absent the last week in a distant part of the country, and was now return∣ed two or three days sooner than he expected, Mr. Tyrrel had willingly embraced this oppor∣tunity, trusting that, if he could now effect his re∣establishment, he should easily preserve the ground he had regained even in the face of his most for∣midable rival. Mr. Tyrrel was certainly not defi∣cient in courage; but he conceived that the present was too important an epocha in his life to allow him to make any unnecessary risk in his chance for future ease and importance. He would gladly have dispensed with the arrival of the new comer.</P>
<P>Both he and Mr. Falkland reddened at sight of each other. Mr. Falkland advanced towards him without a moment's pause, and in a peremptory voice asked him, what he did here?</P>
<P>Here! What do you mean by that? This place is as free to me as you, and you are the last person to whom I shall deign to give an account of myself.</P>
<P>Sir, the place is not free to you. Do not you know you have been voted out? Whatever were your rights, your infamous conduct has forfeited them.</P>
<P>Mr. what do you call yourself, if you have any thing to say to me, choose a proper time and place. Do not think to put on your bullying airs under shelter of this company! I will not endure it.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="028752_0133_0FDBF09D92A6EAE8"/>
You are mistaken, sir. This public scene is the only place where I can have any thing to say to you. If you would not hear of the universal in∣dignation of mankind, you must not come into the society of men. Miss Melvile! Shame upon you, inhuman, unrelenting tyrant! Can you hear her name, and not sink into the earth? Can you re∣tire into solitude, and not see her pale and patient ghost rising to reproach you? Can you recollect her virtues, her innocence, her spotless manners, her unresenting temper, and not run distracted with remorse? Have you not killed her in the first bloom of her youth? Can you bear to think that she now lies mouldering in the grave through your cursed contrivance, that deserved a crown, ten thousand times more than you deserve to live? And do you expect that mankind will ever forget, or forgive such a deed? Go, miserable wretch; think yourself too happy that you are permitted to fly the face of man! Why, what a pitiful figure do you make at this moment! Do you think that any thing could bring so hardened a wretch as you are, to shrink from reproach, if your conscience were not in confederacy with him that reproached you? And were you fool enough to believe that any obstinacy however determined could enable you to despise the keen rebuke of justice? Go, go, shrink into your miserable self! Begone, and let me never be blasted with your fight again!</P>
<P>And here, however incredible it may appear, Mr. Tyrrel began to obey his imperious censurer. His looks were full of wildness and horror; his limbs trembled; and his tongue refused its office. He felt no power of resisting the impetuous tor∣rent of reproach that was poured upon him. He hesitated; he was ashamed of his own defeat; he seemed to wish to deny it. But his struggles were ineffectual; every attempt perished in the moment
<PB N="132" REF="028752_0134_0FDBF05C685EA7E0"/>
it was made. The general voice was eager to abash him. As his confusion became more visible, the outcry increased. It swelled gradually to hoot∣ings, tumult, and a deafening noise of indigna∣tion. At length he willingly retired from the public scene, unable any longer to endure the sen∣sations it inflicted.</P>
<P>In about an hour and a half he returned. No precaution had been taken against this incident, for nothing could be more unexpected. In the in∣terval he had intoxicated himself with large draughts of brandy. In a moment he was in a part of the room where Mr. Falkland was standing, and with one blow of his muscular arm levelled him with the earth. The blow however was not stunning, and Mr. Falkland rose again immediately. It is obvious to perceive how unequal he must have been to this species of contest. He was scarcely risen, before Mr. Tyrrel repeated his blow. Mr. Falkland was now upon his guard, and did not fall. But the blows of his adversary were redou∣bled with a rapidity difficult to conceive, and Mr. Falkland was once again brought to the earth. In this situation Mr. Tyrrel kicked his prostrate enemy, and stooped, apparently with the intention of drag∣ging him along the floor. All this passed in a mo∣ment, and the gentlemen present had not time to recover their surprise. They now interfered, and Mr. Tyrrel once more quitted the apartment.</P>
<P>It is difficult to conceive of any event more ter∣rible to the individual upon whom it fell, than the treatment which Mr. Falkland in this instance ex∣perienced. Every passion of his life was calculated to make him feel it more acutely He had repeated∣ly exerted the most uncommon energy and pru∣dence to prevent the misunderstanding between Mr. Tyrrel and himself from proceeding to extre∣mities; but in vain! It was closed with a cata∣strophe
<PB N="133" REF="028752_0135_0FDBF0A241BAA080"/>
exceeding all that he had feared, or that the most penetrating foresight could have suggested. To Mr. Falkland disgrace was worse than death. The slightest breath of dishonour would have stung him to the very soul. What must it have been with this complication of ignominy, base, humiliating and public? Could Mr. Tyrrel have understood the evil he inflicted, even he under all his circum∣stances of provocation could hardly have perpe∣trated it. Mr. Falkland's mind must have been full of uproar like the war of contending elements, and of such suffering as casts contempt on the re∣finements of inventive cruelty. He wished no doubt for annihilation, to lie down in eternal obli∣vion, in an insensibility, which compared with what he experienced was scarcely less enviable than beatitude itself. Horror, detestation, revenge, in∣expressible longings to shake off the evil, and a per∣suasion that in this case all effort was powerless, must have filled his soul even to bursting.</P>
<P>One other event closed the transactions of this memorable evening. Mr. Falkland was baffled of the vengeance that yet remained to him. Mr. Tyrrel was found by some of the company dead in the street, having been murdered at the distance of a few yards from the assembly house.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<P>I SHALL endeavour to state the remainder of this narrative in the words of Mr. Collins. The reader has already had occasion to perceive that Mr. Collins was a man of no vulgar order; and his reflections on this subject were uncommonly judi∣cious.</P>
<P>"This day was the crisis of Mr. Falkland's his∣tory. From hence took its beginning that gloomy and unsociable melancholy of which he has since been the victim. No two characters can be in cer∣tain respects more strongly contrasted, than the Mr. Falkland of a date prior and subsequent to these events. Hitherto he had been attended by a fortune perpetually prosperous. His mind was sanguine; full of that undoubting confidence in its own powers which prosperity is qualified to pro∣duce. Though the habits of his life were those of a serious and sublime visionary, they were never∣theless full of chearfulness and tranquillity. But from this moment his pride and the lofty adven∣turousness of his spirit were effectually subdued. From an object of envy he was changed into an object of compassion. Life, which hitherto no one had so exquisitely enjoyed, became a burthen to him. No more self-complacency, no more rapture, no more self-approving and heart-transporting be∣nevolence! He, who had lived beyond any man upon the grand and animating reveries of the ima∣gination, seemed now to have no visions but of an∣guish and despair. His case was peculiarly worthy of sympathy, since no doubt, if rectitude and pu∣rity
<PB N="135" REF="028752_0137_0FDBF0A39660A728"/>
of disposition could give a title to happiness, few men could exhibit a more consistent and pow∣erful claim than Mr. Falkland.</P>
<P>"He was too deeply pervaded with the idle and groundless romances of chivalry ever to forget the situation, humiliating and dishonourable according to his ideas, in which he had been placed upon this occasion. There is a mysterious sort of divi∣nity annexed to the person of a true knight, that makes any species of brute violence committed upon it indelible and immortal. To be knocked down, cuffed, kicked, dragged along the floor! sacred heaven, the memory of such a treatment was intolerable! No future lustration could ever remove the stain: and, what was perhaps still worse in the present case, the offender having ceas∣ed to exist, the lustration which the laws of knight-errantry prescribe was rendered impossible.</P>
<P>"In some future period of human improvement it is probable that that calamity will be in a man∣ner unintelligible, which in the present instance contributed to tarnish and wither the excellence of one of the most elevated and amiable of human minds. If Mr. Falkland had reflected with per∣fect accuracy upon the case, he would probably have been able to look down with indifference upon a wound which, as it was, pierced to his very vitals. How much more dignity than in the modern duel∣list do we find in Themistocles, the most gallant of the Greeks; who, when Eurybiades, his comman∣der in chief, in answer to some of his remonstran∣ces, lifted his cane over him with a menacing air, accosted him in that noble apostrophe, Strike, but hear?</P>
<P>"How would a man of true discernment in such a case reply to his brutal assailant? <Q>I make it my boast that I can endure calamity and pain: shall I not be able to endure the trifling incon∣venience
<PB N="136" REF="028752_0138_0FDBF0606A5D3ED0"/>
that your folly can inflict upon me? Perhaps a human being would be more accom∣plished, if he understood the science of person∣al defence; but how few would be the occa∣sions upon which he would be called to exert it? How few human beings would he encoun∣ter so unjust and injurious as you, if his own conduct were directed by the principles of rea∣son and benevolence? Beside, how narrow would be the use of this science, when acquired? It will scarcely put the man of delicate make and petty stature upon a level with the athletic pugilist; and, if it did in some measure secure me against the malice of a single adversary, still my person and my life, so far as mere force is concerned, would▪ always be at the mercy of two. Farther than immediate defence against actual violence it could never be of use to me. The man who can deliberately meet his adver∣sary for the purpose of exposing the persons of one or both of them to injury, tramples upon every principle of reason and equity. Duel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing is the vilest of all egotism, treating the public, which has a claim to all my powers and exer∣tions, as if it were nothing, and myself, or ra∣ther an unintelligible chimera I annex <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o myself, as if it were entitled to my exclusive attention. I am unable to cope with you: what then? Can that circumstance dishonour me? No; I can only be dishonoured by perpetrating an un∣just action. My honour is in my own keeping, beyond the reach of all mankind. Strike! I am passive. No injury that you can inflict shall provoke me to expose you or myself to unneces∣sary evil. I refuse that; but I am not therefore pusillanimous: when I refuse any danger or suf∣fering by which the general good may be pro∣moted, then brand me for a coward!</Q></P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="028752_0139_0FDBF0A5592B9E68"/>
"These reasonings, however simple and irre∣sistible they must be found by a dispassionate en∣quirer, are little reflected on by the world at large, and were most of all uncongenial to the prejudices of Mr. Falkland. But the public disgrace and chas∣tisement that had been imposed upon him, intole∣rable as they were to be recollected, were not the whole of the mischief that redounded to our un∣fortunate patron from the transactions of that day. It was presently whispered that he was no other than the murderer of his antagonist. This rumour was of too much importance to the very continu∣ance of his life, to justify its being concealed from him. He heard it with inexpressible astonishment and horror; it formed a dreadful addition to the load of intellectual anguish that already oppressed him. No man had ever held his reputation so dear to him as Mr. Falkland; and now in one day he was fallen under the most exquisite calamities, a complicated personal insult, and the imputation of the foulest of crimes. He might have fled; for no one was forward to proceed against a man so a∣dored as Mr. Falkland, or in revenge of one so universally execrated as Mr. Tyrrel. But flight he disdained. In the mean time the affair was of too serious a magnitude, the rumour unchecked seem∣ed daily to increase in strength, and the magistrates were at length obliged to take some steps upon the subject. Without causing him to be apprehended, they sent to desire he would appear before them at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their meetings. They investigated the par∣ticulars of the story. What could they do? The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the quarrel, and the odious nature of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> give<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by Mr. Tyrrel were notorious. Mr. Falkland had left the rooms immediately after his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; and, though he had been attended by one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the gentlemen to his inn, it ap∣peared <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had left them upon some slight pre∣tence
<PB N="138" REF="028752_0140_0FDBF06484BBF1D0"/>
as soon as he arrived at it, and, when they enquired for him of the waiters, they were given to understand that he had mounted his horse and rode home. In consideration of these particulars the magistrates concluded that they could not be justified but in committing Mr. Falkland to prison. His defence was manly, logical, and impressive. But, though they entertained the strongest presump∣tion of his innocence, they conceived that they were obliged in their capacity to proceed upon the unfortunate circumstances that appeared against the accused, and commit him for his deliverance to a trial by his country. In all this Mr. Falkland was nearly passive. He seemed to fear by too direct an appeal to judicature to render more precise an im∣putation the memory of which he deprecated, at the same time that he was sufficiently willing to meet the severest scrutiny, and, if he could not hope to have it forgotten that he had ever been ac∣cused, to prove in the most satisfactory manner that the accusation was unjust.</P>
<P>"Never in this quarter of the island was a court more crowded with persons of the highest distinc∣tion than upon Mr. Falkland's trial. Never was expectation wrought to a higher pitch, or the pas∣sions of men more profoundly interested. You seem never to have heard of this memorable trans∣action; and indeed that is little to be wondered at, since the good nature of the world is interested in suppressing it, and it is deemed a disgrace to a man to have held up his hand at a criminal bar, though acquitted with circumstances the most satisfactory and honourable. It may be supposed that this sup∣pression is particularly acceptable to Mr. Falkland; and I should not have acted in contradiction to his modes of thinking in communicating the story to you, had there not been circumstances of peculiar urgency that seemed to render the communication desirable.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="028752_0141_0FDBF0AA199B38B8"/>
"The facts adduced upon the trial were precise∣ly those which had already been laid before the magistrates. By the nature of the case no particu∣lar facts could be stated in balance against these. As soon as the evidence for the crown had been gone through, Mr. Falkland immediately proceed∣ed to his defence. Several copies of the trial were made, and Mr. Falkland seemed for a short time to have the idea of sending it to the press. I have one of these copies in my possession, and I will read from it the speech of the accused, as it was taken down in court."—Saying this, Mr. Collins rose, and took it from a private drawer in his escri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oire.</P>
<P>"My lord, and gentlemen of the jury,</P>
<P>"I stand here accused of a crime the most black that any human creature is capable of perpetrating. I am innocent. I have no fear that I shall fail to make every person in this court acknowledge my innocence. In the mean time what must be my feelings? Conscious as I am of deserving approba∣tion and not censure, of having passed my life in acts of justice and philanthropy, can any thing be more deplorable than for me to stand here to an∣swer a charge of murder? So wretched is my situa∣tion, that I cannot accept your gratuitous acquit∣tal, if you should be disposed to bestow it. I must answer to an imputation, the very thought of which is ten thousand times worse than death. I must exert the whole energy of my mind to prevent my being ranked with the vilest of men.</P>
<P>"Gentlemen, this is a situation in which a man may be allowed to boast. Accursed situation! No man need envy me the vile and polluted triumph I am now to gain! I have called no witnesses to my character. Great God! what sort of a character is that which must be supported by witnesses? But, if I must speak, look round the court, ask of every one present, enquire of your own hearts!
<PB N="140" REF="028752_0142_0FDBF06552F0EC38"/>
Not one word of reproach was ever whispered against my character. I do not hesitate to call upon those who have known me most to afford me the most honourable testimony.</P>
<P>"My life has been spent in the keenest and most unintermitted sensibility to reputation. I am almost indifferent as to what shall be the event of this day. I would not open my mouth upon the occasion, if my life were the only thing that was at stake. It is not in the power of your verdict to restore to me my unblemished reputation, to obli∣terate the disgrace I have suffered, or to prevent it from being remembered that I have been brought to trial upon a charge of murder. Your verdict can never have the efficacy to prevent the miserable remains of my existence from being the most in∣tolerable of all burthens.</P>
<P>"I am accused of having committed murder upon the body of Barnabas Tyrrel. I would most joyfully have given every farthing I possess, and devoted myself to perpetual beggary, to have pre∣served his life. His life was precious to me, be∣yond that of all mankind. In my opinion the greatest injustice committed by his unknown assassin was that of defrauding me of my just revenge. I confess that I would have called him out to the field, and that our encounter should not have been terminated but by the death of one or both of us. This would have been a pitiful and inadequate compensation for his unparalleled insult, but it was all that remained.</P>
<P>"I ask for no pity, but I must openly declare that never was any misfortune so horrible as mine. I would willingly have taken refuge from the re∣collection of that night in a voluntary death. Life was now stripped of all those recommendations for the sake of which it was dear to me. But even this consolation is denied me. I am com∣pelled
<PB N="141" REF="028752_0143_0FDBF0AB1EE03C60"/>
to drag for ever the intolerable load of ex∣istence, upon penalty, if at any period however remote I shake it off, of having that impatience regarded as confirming a charge of murder. Gen∣tlemen, if by your verdict you could take away my life, without that act being connected with my disgrace, I would bless the cord that suspended the breath of my existence for ever.</P>
<P>"You all know how easily I might have fled from this purgation. If I had been guilty, should I not have embraced the opportunity? But, as it was, I could not. Reputation has been the idol, the jewel of my life. I could never have borne to think that a human creature in the remotest part of the globe should believe that I was a criminal. Alas! what a deity it is that I have chosen for my worship! I have entailed upon myself everlasting agony and despair!</P>
<P>"I have but one word to add. Gentlemen, I charge you to do me the imperfect justice that your office puts in your power! My life is a worthless thing. But my honour, the paltry remains of honour I have now to boast, is in your judgment. It is little that you can do for me; but it is not less your duty to do that little. May that God who is the fountain of honour and good, prosper and protect you! The man who now stands before you is devoted to perpetual barrenness and blast! He has nothing to hope for beyond the feeble con∣solation of this day!"</P>
<P>"You will easily imagine that Mr. Falkland was acquitted with every circumstance of honour. Nothing is more to be deplored in human institu∣tions than that the forms of justice should thus subject a man, of whose innocence every one was convinced, to a species of purgation to which the ideas of mankind have annexed a sentiment of dis∣grace. Nobody entertained the shadow of a doubt
<PB N="142" REF="028752_0144_0FDBF069DBBDAB58"/>
upon the subject, and yet a mere incidental con∣currence of circumstances made it necessary that the best of men should be publicly arraigned as if really under suspicion of an atrocious crime. It may be granted indeed that Mr. Falkland had his faults, but those very faults placed him at a still farther distance from the criminality in question. He was the fool of honour and fame; a man whom in the pursuit of reputation nothing could divert; who would have purchased the character of a true, gallant and undaunted hero at the expence of worlds, and who thought every calamity nominal but a stain upon his honour. How atrociously absurd to suppose any motive capable of inducing such a man to play the part of a lurking assassin? How unfeeling to oblige him to defend himself from such an imputation in a court of justice? Did any man, and least of all a man of the purest honour, ever pass in a moment from a life unstain∣ed by a single act of injury to the consummation of human depravity?</P>
<P>"When the verdict of the jury was given, a general murmur of applause and involuntary trans∣port burst forth in the court. It was at first low, and gradually became louder. As it was the ex∣pression of rapturous delight and an emotion disin∣terested and divine, so there was an indescribable something in the very sound that carried it home to the heart, and convinced every spectator that no personal pleasure ever existed that was not fool∣ish and feeble in the comparison. Every one strove who should most express his esteem of the amiable accused. Mr. Falkland was no sooner withdrawn, than the gentlemen in the court crowded together to consult how they should most effectually express their congratulation. They immediately named a deputation to wait upon him for that purpose. The grand jury and the petty jury drew up an ad∣dress
<PB N="143" REF="028752_0145_0FDBF0B163D22698"/>
of a similar nature. The very judges and counsel, though less acquainted with his personal character, were strongly impressed with the mute and universal testimony they witnessed in his fa∣vour, and zealously concurred to assist the general sentiment. It was a sort of sympathetic feeling that took hold upon all ranks and degrees. The multitude received him with huzzas, they took his horses from his carriage, dragged him in triumph, and attended him many miles in his return to his own habitation. It seemed as if a public trial be∣fore a criminal judge, which had hitherto been considered in every event as a brand of disgrace, was converted in the present instance into an occa∣sion of enthusiastic adoration and unexampled honour.</P>
<P>"But nothing could reach the heart of Mr. Falkland. He was not insensible to the general kindness and exertions; but it was too evident that the melancholy that had taken hold of his mind was invincible.</P>
<P>"It was only a few weeks after this memorable trial that the real murderer was discovered. Every part of this story was extraordinary. The real murderer was Hawkins. He was found with his son under a feigned name at a village at about thirty miles distance, in want of all the necessaries of life. He had lived here from the period of his flight in so private a manner, that all the enqui∣ries that had been set on foot by the benevolence of Mr. Falkland or the insatiable malice of Mr. Tyrrel had been insufficient to discover him. The first thing that had led to the detection was a parcel of clothes covered with blood that were found in a ditch, and which, when drawn out, were known by the people of the village to belong to this man. The murder of Mr. Tyrrel was not a circumstance that could be unknown, and sus∣picion
<PB N="144" REF="028752_0146_0FDBF06C128DEC78"/>
was immediately roused. A diligent search being made, the rusty handle with part of the blade of a knife was sound thrown in a corner of his lodging, which being applied to a piece of the point of a knife that had been broken in the wound, appeared exactly to correspond. Upon farther enquiry two rustics, who had been acci∣dentally on the spot, remembered to have seen Hawkins and his son in the town that very even∣ing, and to have called after them, and received no answer, though they were sure of their persons. Upon this accumulated evidence both Hawkins and his son were tried, condemned and afterwards executed. In the interval between the sentence and execution Hawkins confessed his guilt with many marks of compunction; though there are persons by whom this is denied; but I have taken some pains to enquire into the fact, and am per∣suaded that their disbelief is precipitate and ground∣less.</P>
<P>"The cruel injustice that this man had suffered from his village tyrant was not forgotten upon the present occasion. It was by a strange fatality that the barbarous proceedings of Mr. Tyrrel seemed never to fall short of their completion; and even his death served eventually to consummate the ruin of a man he hated, a circumstance, which, if it could have come to his knowledge, would perhaps have in some measure consoled him for his un∣timely end. This poor Hawkins was surely en∣titled to some pity, since his being finally urged to desperation, and brought, together with his son, to an ignominious fate, was originally owing to the sturdiness of his virtue and independence. But the compassion of the public was in a great measure shut against him, as they thought it a piece of barbarous and unpardonable selfishness, that he had not rather come boldly forward to
<PB N="145" REF="028752_0147_0FDBF0B29851F3C0"/>
meet the consequences of his own conduct, than suffer a man of so much public worth as Mr. Falk∣land, and who had been so desirous of doing him good, to be tried for a murder that he had com∣mitted.</P>
<P>"From this time to the present Mr. Falkland has been nearly such as you at present see him. Though it be several years since these transactions, the impression they made is for ever fresh in the mind of our unfortunate patron. From thence∣forward his habits became totally different. He had before been fond of public scenes, and acting a part in the midst of the people among whom he immediately resided. He now made himself a rigid recluse. He had no associates, no friends. Inconsolable himself, he yet wished to treat others with kindness. There was a solemn sadness in his manner, attended with the most perfect gentleness and humanity. Every body respects him, for his benevolence is unalterable; but there is a stately coldness and reserve in his behaviour, which makes it difficult for those about him to regard him with the familiarity of affection. These symptoms are uninterrupted, except at certain times when his sufferings become intolerable, and he displays the marks of a furious insanity. At those times his language is fearful and mysterious, and he seems to figure to himself by turns every sort of perse∣cution and alarm which may be supposed to attend upon an accusation of murder. But, sensible of his own weakness, he is anxious at such times to withdraw into solitude; and his domestics in ge∣neral know nothing of him but the uncommunica∣tive and haughty, yet mild dejection that accom∣panies every thing he does."</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE stated the narrative of Mr. Collins, in∣terspersed with such other information as I was able to collect, with all the exactness that my me∣mory, assisted by certain memorandums I made at the time, will afford. I do not pretend to warrant the authenticity of any part of these memoirs ex∣cept so much as fell under my own knowledge, and that part shall be stated with the same simplicity and accuracy that I would observe towards a court which was to decide in the last resort upon every thing dear to me. The same scrupulous fidelity restrains me from altering the manner of Mr. Col∣lins's narrative to adapt it to the precepts of my own taste; and it will soon be perceived how essential that narrative is to the elucidation of my own history.</P>
<P>The intention of my friend in this communica∣tion was to give me ease; but he in reality added to my embarrassment. Hitherto I had had no in∣tercourse with the world and its passions; and, though I was not totally unacquainted with them as they appear in books, this proved to be of little service to me when I came to witness them myself. The case seemed entirely altered, when the subject of those passions was continually before my eyes, and the events had happened but the other day as it were, in the very neighbourhood where I lived. There was a connection and progress in this nar∣rative, which made it altogether unlike the little village incidents I had hitherto known. My feel∣ings
<PB N="147" REF="028752_0149_0FDBF0FA933BF340"/>
were successively interested for the different persons that were brought upon the scene. My veneration was excited for Mr. Clare, and my ap∣plause for the intrepidity of Mrs. Hammond. I was astonished that any human creature should be so shockingly perverted as Mr. Tyrrel. I paid the tribute of my tears to the memory of the artless Miss Melvile. I found a thousand fresh reasons to admire and love my master.</P>
<P>At first I was satisfied with thus considering every incident in its obvious sense. But the story I had heard was for ever in my thoughts, and I was peculiarly interested to comprehend its full im∣port. I turned it a thousand ways, and examined it in every point of view. In the original commu∣nication it appeared sufficiently distinct and satis∣factory; but, as I brooded over it, it gradually be∣came mysterious. There was something strange in the character of Hawkins. So firm, so sturdily honest and just, as he appeared at first; all at once to become a murderer! His first behaviour under the prosecution, how accurately was it calculated to prepossess one in his favor! To be sure, if he were guilty, it was very cruel of him to suffer a man of so much worth as Mr. Falkland to be tried for his crime! And yet I could not help bitterly com∣passionating the honest fellow, brought to the gal∣lows, as he was, strictly speaking, by the machi∣nations of that devil incarnate, Mr. Tyrrel. His son too, that son for whom he voluntarily sacrificed his all, to die with him at the same tree; surely never was a story more affecting!</P>
<P>Was it possible after all that Mr. Falkland should be the murderer? The reader will scarcely believe that the idea suggested itself to my mind, that I would ask him. It was but a passing thought; but it serves to mark the simplicity of my charac∣ter. Then I recollected the virtues of my master,
<PB N="148" REF="028752_0150_0FDBF0BAFAAB8800"/>
almost too sublime for human nature; I thought of his sufferings so unexampled, so unmerited; and chid myself for the suspicion. The dying confession of Hawkins recurred to my mind; and I felt that there was no longer a possibility of doubting. And yet what was the meaning of all Mr. Falkland's agonies and terrors? In fine, the idea having once occurred to my mind, it was fixed there for ever. My thoughts fluctuated from conjecture to conjecture, but this was the centre about which they revolved. I determined to place myself as a watch upon my master.</P>
<P>The instant I had chosen this employment for myself, I found a strange sort of pleasure in it. To do what is forbidden always has its charms, because we have an indistinct apprehension of something arbitrary and tyrannical in the prohibi∣tion. To be a spy upon Mr. Falkland! That there was danger in the employment served to give an alluring pungency to the choice. I remembered the stern reprimand I had received, his terrible looks; and the recollection gave a kind of tingling sensation, not altogether unallied to enjoyment. The farther I advanced, the more the sensation was irresistible. I seemed to myself perpetually upon the brink of being countermined, and perpetually roused to guard my designs. The more impene∣trable Mr. Falkland was determined to be, the more uncontroulable was my curiosity. Through the whole my alarm and apprehension of personal danger, had a large mixture of frankness and sim∣plicity, conscious of meaning no ill, that made me continually ready to say every thing that was upon my mind, and would not suffer me to believe that, when things were brought to the test, any one could be seriously angry with me.</P>
<P>These reflections led gradually to a new state of my mind. When I had first removed into Mr.
<PB N="149" REF="028752_0151_0FDBF0FCE3DEC8F8"/>
Falkland's family, the novelty of the scene render∣ed me cautious and reserved. The distant and so∣lemn manners of my master seemed to have anni∣hilated my constitutional gaiety. But the novelty by degrees wore off, and my constraint in the same degree diminished. The story I had now heard, and the curiosity it excited, restored to me acti∣vity, eagerness and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ourage. I had always had a propensity to communicate my thoughts; my age was naturally inclined to talkativeness; and I ven∣tured occasionally in a sort of hesitating way, as if questioning whether such a conduct might be al∣lowed to express my sentiments as they arose, in the presence of Mr. Falkland.</P>
<P>The first time I did so, he looked at me with an air of surprise, made me no answer, and presently took occasion to leave me. The experiment was soon after repeated. My master seemed half in∣clined to encourage me, and yet doubtful whether he might venture. He had been long a stranger to pleasure of every sort, and my artless and untaught remarks appeared to promise him some amusement. In this uncertainty he could not probably find it in his heart to treat with severity my innocent ef∣fusions. I needed but little encouragement: for the perturbation of my mind stood in want of this relief. My simplicity, arising from my being a total stranger to the intercourse of the world, was accompanied with a mind in some degree cultivated with reading, and perhaps not altogether destitute of observation and talent. My remarks were there∣fore perpetually unexpected, at one time implying extreme ignorance, and at another some portion of acuteness, but at all times having an air of in∣nocence, frankness and courage. There was still an apparent want of design in the manner, even after I was excited accurately to compare my obser∣vations and study the inferences to which they led;
<PB N="150" REF="028752_0152_0FDBF0BC5BA550F8"/>
for the effect of old habit was more visible, than that of a recently-conceived purpose which was hardly yet mature. Mr. Falkland's situation was like that of a fish that plays with the bait employed to entrap him. By my manner he was in a certain degree encouraged to lay aside his usual reserve and relax his stateliness; till some abrupt observation or interrogatory stung him into recollection and brought back his alarm. Still it was evident that he bore about him a secret wound. Whenever the cause of his sorrows was touched, though in a manner the most indirect and remote, his coun∣tenance altered, his distemper returned, and it was with difficulty that he could suppress his emotions, sometimes conquering himself with painful effort, and sometimes bursting into a sort of paroxism of insanity, and hastening to bury himself in solitude. These appearances I too frequently interpreted into grounds of suspicion, though I might with equal probability and more liberality have ascribed them to the cruel mortifications he had encountered in the objects of his darling ambition. Mr. Collins had strongly urged me to secrecy; and Mr. Falk∣land, whenever my gesture or his consciousness impressed him with the idea of my knowing more than I expressed, looked at me with wistful earnest∣ness, as questioning what was the degree of infor∣mation I possessed, and how it was obtained. But again at our next interview the simple vivacity of my manner restored his tranquillity, obliterated the emotion of which I had been the cause, and placed things afresh in their former situation. The longer this humble familiarity on my part had continued, the more effort it would require to suppress it; and Mr. Falkland was neither willing to mortify me by a severe prohibition of speech, nor even perhaps to make me of so much consequence as that prohibition might seem to imply. Though I
<PB N="151" REF="028752_0153_0FDBF1012B07EE20"/>
was curious, it must not be supposed that I had the object of my enquiry for ever in my mind, or that my questions and innuendos were perpetually re∣gulated with the cunning of a grey-headed inqui∣sitor. The secret wound of Mr. Falkland's mind was much more uniformly present to his recol∣lection than to mine; and a thousand times he applied the remarks that occurred in conversation, when I had not the remotest idea of such an ap∣plication till some singularity in his manner brought it back to my thoughts. The consciousness of this morbid sensibility, and the imagination that its in∣fluence might perhaps constitute the whole of the case, served probably to spur Mr. Falkland again to the charge, and connect a sentiment of shame with every project that suggested itself for interrupting the freedom of our intercourse.</P>
<P>I will give a specimen of the conversations to which I allude, and as it shall be selected from those which began upon topics the most general and remote, the reader will easily imagine the dis∣turbance that was almost daily endured by a mind so tremblingly alive as that of my master.</P>
<P>Pray, sir, said I, one day as I was assisting Mr. Falkland in arranging some papers previously to their being transcribed into his collection, how came Alexander of Macedon to be surnamed the Great?</P>
<P>How came it? Did you never read his his∣tory?</P>
<P>Yes, sir.</P>
<P>Well, Williams, and could you find no reasons there?</P>
<P>Why, I do not know, sir. I could find reasons why he should be famous; but every man that is talked of, is not admired. Judges differ about the merits of Alexander. Doctor Prideaux says in his Connections that he deserves only to be called the
<PB N="152" REF="028752_0154_0FDBF0C2EB6FDB98"/>
Great Cut-throat, and the author of Tom Jones has written a volume to prove that he and all other conquerors ought to be classed with Jonathan Wild.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland involuntarily reddened at these citations.</P>
<P>Accursed blasphemy! Did these authors think that by the coarseness of their ribaldry they could destroy his well-earned fame? Are learning, sensi∣bility and taste no securities to exempt their pos∣sessor from this vulgar abuse? Did you ever read, Williams, of a man more gallant, generous and free? Was ever mortal so completely the reverse of every thing engrossing and selfish? He formed to himself a sublime image of excellence, and his only ambition was to realise it in his own story. Remember his giving away every thing when he set out upon his grand expedition, professedly re∣serving for himself nothing but hope. Recollect his heroic confidence in Philip, the physician, and his entire and unalterable friendship for Ephestion. He treated the captive family of Darius with the most cordial urbanity, and the venerable Sysigambis with all the tenderness and attention of a son to his mother. Never take the judgment, Williams, upon such a subject of a clerical pedant or a West∣minster justice. Examine for yourself, and you will find in Alexander a model of honour, gene∣rosity and disinterestedness, a man who for the cultivated liberality of his mind and the unparallel∣ed grandeur of his projects must stand alone the spectacle and admiration of all ages of the world.</P>
<P>Ah, sir! it is a very fine thing for us to sit here and compose his panegyric. But would you have me forget what a vast expence was bestowed in erecting the monument of his fame? Was not he the common disturber of mankind? Did nor he overrun nations that would never have heard of him, but for his devastations? How many hun∣dred
<PB N="153" REF="028752_0155_0FDBF10216F85730"/>
thousands of lives did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acrifice in his ca∣reer? What must I think of his cruelties; a whole tribe massacred for a crime committed by their an∣cestors one hundred and fifty years before; fifty thousand sold into slavery; two thousand crucified for their gallant defence of their country? Man is surely a strange sort of creature, who never praises any one more heartily than him who has spread destruction and ruin over the face of nations!</P>
<P>The way of thinking you express, Williams, is natural enough, and I cannot blame you for it. But let me hope that you will become more liberal. The death of a hundred thousand men is at first fight very shocking; but what in reality are a hun∣dred thousand such men more than a hundred thou∣sand sheep? It is mind, Williams, the generation of knowledge and virtue that we ought to love. This was the project of Alexander; he set out in a great undertaking to civilise mankind; he de∣livered the vast continent of Asia from the stupidity and degradation of the Persian monarchy; and, though he was cut off in the midst of his career, we may easily perceive the vast effects of his pro∣ject. Grecian literature and cultivation, the Seleucidae, the Antiochuses and the Prolomies fol∣lowed, in nations which before had been sunk to the condition of brutes. Alexander was the builder as notoriously as the destroyer of cities.</P>
<P>And yet, sir, I am afraid that the pike and the battle-axe are not the right instruments for making men wise. Suppose it were admitted that the lives of men were to be sacrificed without re∣morse if a paramount good were to result, it seems to me as if murder and massacre were but a very left-handed way of producing civilisation and love. But pray, do not you think this great hero was a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort of a madman? What now will you say to his
<PB N="154" REF="028752_0156_0FDBF0C3D3D08A50"/>
firing the palace of Persepolis, his weeping for other worlds to conquer, and his marching his whole army over the burning sands of Lybia, merely to visit a temple, and persuade mankind that he was the son of Jupiter Ammon?</P>
<P>Alexander, my boy, has been much misunder∣stood. Mankind have revenged themselves upon him by misrepresentation, for having so far eclipsed the rest of his species. It was necessary to the realising his project that he should pass for a God. It was the only way by which he could get a firm hold upon the veneration of the stupid and bi∣goted Persians. It was this, and not a mad va∣nity, that was the source of his proceeding. And how much had he to struggle with in this respect in the unapprehending obstinacy of some of his Ma∣cedonians?</P>
<P>Why then, sir, at last Alexander did but employ means that all politicians profess to use, as well as he. He dragooned men into wisdom, and cheated them into the pursuit of their own happiness. But what is worse, sir, this Alexander in the paroxysm of his headlong rage spared neither friend nor foe. You will not pretend to justify the excesses of his ungovernable passion. It is impossible sure that a word can be said for a man whom a momentary provocation can hurry into the commission of mur∣ders—</P>
<P>The instant I had uttered these words, I felt what it was that I had done. There was a mag∣netical sympathy between me and my master, so that their effect was not sooner produced upon him, than my own mind reproached me with the inhumanity of the allusion. Our confusion was mutual. The blood forsook at once the transparent complexion of Mr. Falkland, and then rushed back again with rapidity and fierceness. I dared not
<PB N="155" REF="028752_0157_0FDBF1045A60EA18"/>
utter a word, lest I should commit a new error worse than that into which I had just fallen. After a short, but severe, struggle to continue the conversation, Mr. Falkland began with trepidation, but afterwards became calmer:</P>
<P>You are not candid—Alexander—You must learn more clemency—Alexander, I say, does not deserve this rigour. Do you remember his tears, his remorse, his determined abstinence from food, which he could scarcely be persuaded to alter? Did not that prove acute feeling and a rooted principle of equity?—Well, well, Alexander was a true and judicious lover of mankind, and his real me∣rits have been little comprehended.</P>
<P>I know not how to make the state of my mind at that moment accurately understood. When one idea has got possession of the mind, it is scarcely possible to keep it from finding its way to the lips. Error, once committed, has a fascinating power, like the eyes of the rattle-snake, to draw us into a second error. It deprives us of that proud confi∣dence in our own strength, to which we are in∣debted for so much of our virtue. Curiosity is a restless propensity, and often does but hurry us forward the more irresistibly, the greater is the danger that attends its indulgence.</P>
<P>Clitus, said I, was a man of very coarse and provoking manners, was he not?</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland felt the full force of this appeal. He gave me a penetrating look as if he would see my very soul. His eyes were then in an instant withdrawn. I could perceive him seized with a convulsive shuddering, which, though strongly counteracted, and therefore scarcely visible, had I know not what of terrible in it. He left his em∣ployment, strode about the room in anger, his visage gradually assumed an expression as of super∣natural
<PB N="156" REF="028752_0158_0FDBF0C857A84640"/>
barbarity, he quitted the apartment abrupt∣ly, and flung the door with a violence that seemed to shake the house.</P>
<P>Is this, said I, the fruit of conscious guilt, or of the disgust that a man of honour conceives at guilt undeservedly imputed?</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<P>THE reader will feel how rapidly I was advanc∣ing to the brink of the precipice. I had a confused apprehension of what I was doing, but I could not stop myself. Is it possible, said I, that Mr. Falkland, who is thus overwhelmed with a sense of the unmerited dishonour that has been fastened upon him in the face of the word, will long endure the presence of a raw and unfriended youth, who is perpetually bringing back that dishonour to his recollection, and who seems himself the most for∣ward to entertain the accusation?</P>
<P>I felt indeed that Mr. Falkland would not hastily incline to dismiss me, for the same reason that re∣strained him from many other actions which might seem to savour of a too tender and ambiguous sen∣sibility. But this reflexion was little adapted to comfort me. That he should cherish in his heart a growing hatred against me, and that he should think himself obliged to retain me a continual thorn in his side, was an idea by no means of fa∣vourable augury to my future peace.</P>
<P>It was some time after this that in clearing out a case of drawers I found a paper that by some acci∣dent had slipped behind one of the drawers, and been overlooked. At another time perhaps my curiosity might have given way to the laws of de∣corum, and I should have restored it unopened to my master, its owner. But my eagerness for in∣formation had been too much stimulated by the preceding incidents to allow me at present to neglect
<PB N="158" REF="028752_0160_0FDBF0C92C0AF6A0"/>
any occasion of obtaining it. The paper proved to be a letter written by the elder Hawkins, and from its contents seemed to have been penned when he had first been upon the point of absconding from the persecutions of Mr. Tyrrel. It was as follows.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honourable Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have waited some time in daily hope of your honour's return into these parts. Old Gines and his dame, who are lest to take care of your house, tell me, they cannot say when that will be, nor justly in what part of England you are at present. For my share misfortune comes so thick upon me, that I must determine upon something (that is for certain), and out of hand. Our squire, who I must own at first used me kindly enough, though I am afraid that was partly out of spite to squire Underwood, has since determined to be the ruin of me. Sir, I have been no craven; I fought it up stoutly; for after all, you know, God bless your honour! it is but a man to a man; but he has been too much for me.</P>
<P>Perhaps if I were to ride over to the market town and enquire of Munsle, your lawyer, he could tell me how to direct to you. But having hoped and waited o' this fashion, and all in vain, has put me upon other thoughts. I was in no hurry, sir, to apply to you; for I do not love to be a trouble to other people. I kept that for my last stake. Well, sir, and now that has failed me like, I am ashamed as it were to have thought of it. Have not I, thinks I, arms and legs as well as other people? I am driven out of house and home. Well, and what then? Sure I arn't a cabbage, that if you pull it out of the ground, it must die. I am pennyless. True; and how many hundreds are there that live from hand to mouth all the days
<PB N="159" REF="028752_0161_0FDBF10999AC9608"/>
of their life? (Begging your honour's pardon) thinks I, if we little folks had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut the wit to do for ourselves, the great folks would not be such maggoty changelings as they are. They would be∣gin to look about them.</P>
<P>But there is another thing that has swayed with me more than all the rest. I do not know how to tell you, sir—My poor boy, my Leonard, the pride of my life, has been three weeks in the county jail. It is true indeed, sir. Squire Tyrrel put him there. Now, sir, every time that I lay my head upon my pillow under my own little roof, my heart smites me with the situation of my Leonard. I do not mean so much for the hardship; I do not so much matter that. I do not expect him to go through the world upon velvet; I am not such a fool. But who can tell what may hap in a jail? I have been three times to see him; and there is one man in the same quarter of the prison that looks so wicked! I do not much fancy the looks of the rest. To be sure Leonard is as good a lad as ever lived. I think he will not give his mind to such. But, come what will, I am determined he shall not stay among them twelve hours longer. I am an obstinate old fool perhaps; but I have taken it into my head, and I will do it. Do not ask me what. But, if I were to write to your honour, and wait for your answer, it might take a week or ten days more. I must not think of it!</P>
<P>Squire Tyrrel is very headstrong, and you, your honour, might be a little hottish or so. No, I would not have any body quarrel for me. There has been mischief enough done already; and I will get myself out of the way. So I write this, your honour, merely to unload my mind. I feel myself equally as much bound to respect and love you, as if you had done every thing for me that I believe you would have done if things had chanced dif∣ferently.
<PB N="160" REF="028752_0162_0FDBF0CA951CCCE8"/>
It is most likely you will never hear of me any more. If it should be so, set your worthy heart at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est. I know myself too well ever to be tempted to do any thing that is really bad. I have now my fortune to seek in the world. I have been used ill enough, God knows. But I bear no ma∣lice; my heart is at peace with all mankind; and I forgive every body. It is like enough that poor Leonard and I may have hardship enough to un∣dergo, among strangers and being obliged to hide ourselves like house-breakers or highwaymen. But I defy all the malice of fortune to make us do an ill thing. That consolation we will always keep against all the crosses of a heart-breaking world.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>I read this letter with considerable attention, and it occasioned me many reflections. To my way of thinking it contained a very interesting picture of a blunt, downright, honest mind. It is a me∣lancholy consideration, said I to myself; but such is man! To have judged from appearances one would have said, This is a fellow, to have taken fortune's buffets and rewards with an incorruptible mind. And yet see where it all ends! This man was capable of afterwards becoming a murderer, and finishing his life at the gallows. O poverty! thou art indeed omnipotent! Thou grindest us into desperation; thou confoundest all our boasted and most deep-rooted principles; thou fillest us to the very brim with malice and revenge, and renderest us capable of acts of unknown horror! May I ne∣ver be visited by thee in the fulness of thy power!</P>

Having satisfied my curiosity with respect to this paper, I took care to dispose of it in such a man∣ner as that it should be found by Mr. Falkland; at the same time that, in obedience to the principle which at present governed me with absolute domi∣nion, I was willing that the way in which it offer∣ed itself to his attention, should suggest to him the idea that it had possibly passed through my hands. The next morning I saw him, and I exerted myself to lead the conversation, which by this time I well knew how to introduce, by insensible degrees to the point I desired. After several previous questions, remarks and rejoinders, I continued:</P>
<P>Well, sir, after all, I cannot help feeling very uncomfortably as to my ideas of human nature, when I find that there is no dependence to be placed upon its perseverance, and that, at least among the illiterate, the most promising appearan∣ces may end in the foulest disgrace.</P>
<P>You think then that literature and a cultivated mind are the only assurance for the constancy of our principles?</P>
<P>Um!—why do you suppose, sir, that learning and ingenuity do not often serve people rather to hide their crimes, than to restrain them from com∣mitting them? History tells us strange things in that respect.</P>
<P>Williams! said Mr. Falkland, a little disturbed, you are strangely given to censure and severity.</P>
<P>I hope not. I am sure I am most fond of look∣ing on the other side of the picture, and consider∣ing how many men have been aspersed, and even at some time or other almost torn to pieces by their fellow creatures, whom, when properly understood, we find worthy of our reverence and love.</P>
<P>Indeed, replied Mr. Falkland with a sigh, when I consider these things, I do not wonder at the dy∣ing exclamation of Brutus, O Virtue! I sought
<PB N="162" REF="028752_0164_0FDBF0CF0760A430"/>
thee as a substance, but I find thee an empty name! I am too much inclined to be of his opinion.</P>
<P>Why to be sure, sir, innocence and guilt are too much confounded in human life. I remember a very affecting story of a poor man in the reign of queen Elizabeth, who would have infallibly been hanged for murder upon the strength of circum∣stantial evidence, if the person really concerned had not been himself upon the jury, and prevent∣ed it.</P>
<P>In saying this I touched the spring that waken∣ed madness in his mind. He came up to me with a ferocious countenance as if determined to force me into a confession of my thoughts. A sudden pang however seemed to change his design; he drew back with trepidation; and exclaimed, De∣tested be the universe, and the laws that govern it! Honour, justice, virtue are all the juggle of knaves! If it were in my power, I would instantly crush the whole system into nothing!</P>
<P>I replied; Oh, sir! things are not so bad as you imagine. The world was made for men of sense to do what they will with it. Its affairs cannot be better than in the direction of the ge∣nuine heroes; and, as in the end they will be found the truest friends of the whole, so the mul∣titude have nothing to do, but to look on, be fashioned and admire.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland made a powerful effort to recover his tranquillity. Williams! said he, you instruct me well. You have a right notion of things, and I have great hopes of you. I will be more of a man. I will forget the past, and do better for the time to come. The future, the future is always our own.</P>
<P>I am sorry, sir, that I have given you pain. I am afraid to say all that I think. But it is my opi∣nion that mistakes will ultimately be cleared up,
<PB N="163" REF="028752_0165_0FDBF110537268A8"/>
justice be done, and the true state of things come to light in spite of the false colours that may for a time obscure it.</P>
<P>The idea I suggested did not give Mr. Falkland the proper degree of delight. He suffered a tem∣porary relapse. Justice!—he muttered. I do not know what is justice. My case is not within the reach of common remedies; perhaps of none. I only know that I am miserable. I began life with the best intentions and the most fervid philanthro∣py; and here I am—miserable—miserable beyond expression or endurance.</P>
<P>Having said this, he seemed suddenly to recol∣lect himself, and re-assume his accustomed dignity and command. How came this conversation? cried he. Who gave you a right to be my confi∣dent? Base, artful wretch that you are! learn to be more respectful! Are my passions to be wound and unwound by an insolent domestic? Do you think I will be an instrument to be played on at your pleasure, till you have extorted all the trea∣sures of my soul? Begone, and fear le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t you be made to pay for the temerity you have already committed.</P>
<P>There was an energy and determination in the gestures with which these words were accompanied that did not admit of their being disputed. My mouth was closed; I felt as if deprived of all share of activity, and was only able silently and passive∣ly to quit the apartment.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV.</HEAD>
<P>TWO days subsequent to this conversation Mr. Falkland ordered me to be called to him. [I shall continue to speak in my narrative of the silent, as well as the articulate part of the intercourse be∣tween us. His countenance was habitually ani∣mated and expressive much beyond that of any other man I have seen. The curiosity, which, as I have said, constituted at this time my ruling pas∣sion, stimulated me to make it my perpetual study. It will also most probably happen, while I am thus employed in collecting together the scattered inci∣dents of my history, that I shall upon some occa∣sions annex to appearances an explanation, which I was far from possessing at the time, and was only suggested to me through the medium of subsequent events.]</P>
<P>Upon this occasion Mr. Falkland's countenance exhibited an unwonted composure. This compo∣sure however did not seem to result from internal ease, but from an effort which, while he prepared himself for an interesting scene, was exerted to prevent his presence of mind and power of volun∣tary action from suffering any diminution.</P>
<P>Williams, said he, I am determined, whatever it may cost me, to have an explanation with you. You are a rash and inconsiderate boy, and have given me a great deal of disturbance. You ought to have known that, though I allow you to talk with me upon indifferent subjects, it is very impro∣per in you to lead the conversation to any thing
<PB N="165" REF="028752_0167_0FDBF1159DD55FF8"/>
that relates to my personal concerns. You have said many things lately in a very mysterious way, and appear to know something more than I am aware of. I am equally at a loss to guess how you came by your knowledge, as of what it con∣sists. But I think I perceive too much inclination on your part to trifle with my peace of mind. That ought not to be, nor have I deserved any such treatment from you. But, be that as it will, the guesses in which you oblige me to employ myself are too painful. It is a sort of sporting with my feeling, which, as a man of resolution, I am de∣termined to bring to an end. I expect you there∣fore to lay aside all mystery and equivocation, and inform me explicitly what it is upon which your allusions are built. What is it you know? What is it you want? I have been too much exposed already to an unparalleled mortification and hard∣ship, and my wounds will not bear this perpetual handling.</P>
<P>I feel, sir, answered I, how wrong I have been, and am ashamed that such a one as I should have given you all this trouble and displeasure. I felt it at the time; but I have been hurried along I do not know how. I have always tried to stop myself, but the devil that possessed me was too strong for me. I know nothing, sir, but what Mr. Collins told me. He told me the story of Mr. Tyrrel and Miss Melvile and Hawkins. I am sure, sir, he said nothing but what was to your honour, and proved you to be more an angel than a man.</P>
<P>Well, sir: I found a letter written by that Haw∣kins the other day: did not that letter fall into your hands? Did not you read it?</P>
<P>For God's sake, sir, turn me out of your house. Punish me in some way or other, that I may for∣give myself. I am a foolish, wicked, despicable wretch. I confess, sir, I did read the letter.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="028752_0168_0FDBF0D2123ACB38"/>
And how dared you read it? It was indeed very wrong of you. But we will talk of that by and by. Well, and what did you say to the letter? You know it seems that Hawkins was hanged.</P>
<P>I say, sir? why it went to my heart to read it. I say, as I said the day before yesterday, that, when I see a man of so much principle, afterwards deliberately proceeding to the very worst of crimes, I can scarcely bear to think of it.</P>
<P>That is what you say? It seems too you know, accursed remembrance! that I was tried for this crime?</P>
<P>I was silent.</P>
<P>Well, sir. You know too perhaps that, from the hour the crime was committed,—yes, sir, that was the date [and, as he said this, there was some∣what frightful, I had almost said diabolical, in his countenance]—I have not had an hour's peace; I became changed from the happiest into the most miserable thing that lives; sleep has fled from my eyes; joy has been a stranger to my thoughts; and annihilation I should prefer a thousand times to the being that I lead. As soon as I was capable of a choice, I chose honour and the esteem of mankind as a good I preferred to all others. You know, it seems, in how many ways my ambition has been disappointed,—I do not thank Collins for having been the historian of my disgrace,—Would to God that night could be blotted from the memory of man!—But the scene of that night, instead of perishing, has been a source of ever new cala∣mity to me, which must flow for ever! Am I then, thus miserable and ruined, a proper subject for you upon which to exercise your ingenuity, and improve your power of tormenting? Was it not enough that I was publicly dishonoured? that I was deprived by the pestilential influence of some demon of the opportunity of avenging my dis∣honour?
<PB N="167" REF="028752_0169_0FDBF11AAEBCA150"/>
No: in addition to this I have been tried upon the charge of having in this critical mo∣ment intercepted my own vengeance by the foulest of crimes. That trial is past. Misery itself has nothing worse in store for me except what you have inflicted: the seeming to doubt of my inno∣cence which neither persecutor, nor judge, nor jury ever ventured to do. You have forced me to this explanation. You have extorted from me a confidence which I had no inclination to confer. But it is a part of the misery of my situation, that I am at the mercy of every creature, however little, who feels himself inclined to sport with my dis∣tress. Be content. You have brought me low enough.</P>
<P>Oh, sir! I am not content; I cannot be con∣tent! I cannot bear to think what I have done. I shall never again be able to look in the face the best of masters and the best of men. I beg of you, sir, to turn me out of your service. Let me go and hide myself where I may never see you more.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland's countenance had indicated great severity through the whole of this conversation; but now it became more harsh and tempestuous than ever. How now, rascal! cried he. You want to leave me, do you? Who told you that I wished to part with you? But you cannot bear to live with such a miserable wretch as I am! You are not disposed to put up with the caprices of a man so dissatisfied and unjust!</P>
<P>Oh, sir! do not talk to me thus! Do with me any thing you will. Kill me if you please.</P>
<P>Kill you! [Volumes could not describe the emo∣tions with which this echo of my words was given and received.]</P>
<P>Sir, I could die to serve you! I love you more than I can express. I worship you as a being of a superior nature. I am foolish, raw, inexperienced,
<PB N="168" REF="028752_0170_0FDBF0D68CB78610"/>
—worse than any of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se;—but never did a thought of disloyalty to your service enter into my heart.</P>
<P>Here our conversation ended; and the impres∣sion it made upon my youthful mind it is impossi∣ble to describe. I thought with astonishment, even with rapture, of the attention and kindness towards me I discovered in Mr. Falkland through all the roughness of his manner. I could never wonder enough at finding myself, humble as I was by my birth, obscure as I had hitherto been, thus sud∣denly become of so much importance to the hap∣piness of one of the most enlightened and accom∣plished men in England. But this consciousness attached me to my master more eagerly than ever, and made me swear a thousand times as I medi∣tated upon my situation, that I would never prove unworthy of so generous a protector.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI.</HEAD>
<P>IS it not unaccountable that, in the midst of all my increased veneration for my master, the first tumult of my emotion was scarcely subsided, before the old question that had excited my conjectures recurred to my mind, Was he the murderer? It was a kind of fatal impulse that seemed destined to hurry me to destruction. I did not wonder at the disturbance that was given to Mr. Falkland by any allusion however distant to this fatal affair. That was as completely accounted for from the consideration of his excessive sensibility in matters of honour, as it would have been upon the sup∣position of the most atrocious guilt. Knowing as he did, that such a charge had once been connect∣ed with his name, he would of course be perpe∣tually uneasy, and suspect some latent insinuation at every possible opportunity. He would doubt and fear, lest every man with whom he conversed harboured the foulest suspicions against him. In my case he found that I was in possession of some information more than he was aware of, without its being possible for him to decide to what it amounted, whether I had heard a just or unjust, a candid or calumniatory tale. He had also reason to suppose that I gave entertainment to thoughts derogatory to his honour, and that I did not form that favourable judgment which the exquisite re∣finement of his ruling passion made indispensable to his peace. All these considerations would of course maintain in him a state of perpetual uneasiness.
<PB N="170" REF="028752_0172_0FDBF0D755D83190"/>
But, though I could find nothing that I could con∣sider as justifying me in persisting in the shadow of a doubt, yet, as I have said, the uncertainty and restlessness of my contemplations would by no means depart from me.</P>
<P>The fluctuating state of my mind produced a contention of opposite principles that by turns usurped dominion over my conduct. Sometimes I was influenced by the most complete veneration for my master; I placed an unreserved confidence in his integrity and his virtue, and implicitly surren∣dered my understanding for him to set it to what point he pleased. At other times the confidence, which had before flowed with the most plenteous tide, began to ebb; I was, as I had already been, watchful, inquisitive, suspicious, full of a thousand conjectures as to the meaning of the most indif∣ferent actions. Mr. Falkland, who was most pain∣fully alive to every thing that related to his honour, saw these variations, and betrayed his conscious∣ness of them now in one manner and now in an∣other, frequently before I was myself aware, some∣times almost before they existed. The situation of both was distressing; we were each of us a plague to the other; and I often wondered that the for∣bearance and benignity of my master was not at length exhausted, and that he did not determine to thrust from him for ever so incessant an observer. There was indeed one eminent difference between his share in the transaction and mine. I had some consolation in the midst of my restlessness. Curi∣osity is a principle that carries its pleasures as well as its pains along with it. The mind is urged by a perpetual stimulus; it seems as if it were con∣tinually approaching to the end of its race; and, as the insatiable desire of satisfaction is its princi∣ple of conduct, so it promises itself in that satis∣faction an unknown gratification, which seems as
<PB N="171" REF="028752_0173_0FDBF11F51F58CA8"/>
if it were capable of fully compensating any inju∣ries that may be suffered in the career. But to Mr. Falkland there was no consolation. What he endured in the intercourse between us appeared to be all gratuitous evil. He had only to wish that there was no such person as myself in the world, and to curse the hour when his humanity led him to rescue me from my obscurity, and place me in his service.</P>
<P>A consequence produced upon me by the ex∣traordinary nature of my situation it is necessary to mention. The constant state of vigilance and sus∣picion in which my mind was retained worked a very rapid change in my character. It seemed to have all the effect that might have been expected from years of observation and experience. The strictness with which I endeavoured to remark what passed in the mind of one man, and the va∣riety of conjectures into which I was led, appear∣ed as it were to render me a competent adept in the different modes in which the human intellect displays its secret workings. I no longer said to myself, as I had done in the beginning, "I will ask Mr. Falkland whether he were the murderer." On the contrary, after having carefully examined the different kinds of evidence of which the subject was susceptible, and recollecting all that had al∣ready passed upon the subject, it was not with∣out considerable pain that I felt myself unable to discover any way in which I could be perfectly and unalterably satisfied of my master's innocence. As to his guilt, I could scarcely bring myself to doubt that in some way or other, sooner or later, I should arrive at the knowledge of that, if it really existed. But I could not endure to think almost for a moment of that side of the alternative as true; and, with all my ungovernable suspicion, arising from the mysteriousness of the circum∣stances,
<PB N="172" REF="028752_0174_0FDBF0DCE8C08A78"/>
and the delight which a young and un∣fledged mind receives from ideas that give scope to all that imagination can picture of terrible or sub∣lime, I could not yet bring myself to consider Mr. Falkland's guilt as a supposition attended with the remotest probability.</P>
<P>I hope the reader will forgive me for dwelling thus long on preliminary circumstances. I shall come soon enough to the story of my own misery. I have already said that one of the motives which induced me to the penning of this narrative was to console myself in my insupportable distress. I derive a melancholy pleasure from dwelling upon the circumstances which imperceptibly paved the way to my ruin. While I recollect or describe past scenes which occurred in a more favourable period of my life, my attention is called off for a short interval from the hopeless misfortune in which I am at present involved. The man must indeed possess an uncommon portion of hardness of heart, who can envy me so slight a relief.—To proceed.</P>
<P>For some time after the explanation which had thus taken place between me and my master, his melancholy, instead of being in the slightest degree diminished by the lenient hand of time, went on perpetually to increase. His fits of insanity, for such I must denominate them for want of a distinct appellation, though it is possible they might not fall under the definition that either the faculty or the court of chancery appropriate to that term, became stronger and more durable than ever. It was no longer practicable wholly to conceal them from the family and even from the neighbourhood. He would sometimes without any previous notice absent himself from his house for two or three days, unaccompanied by any servants or attendants. This was the more extraordinary, as it was well
<PB N="173" REF="028752_0175_0FDBF12492F3A388"/>
known that he paid no visits, nor kept up any sort of intercourse with the gentlemen of the vicinity. But it was impossible that a man of Mr. Falkland's distinction and fortune should long continue in such a practice without its being discovered what was become of him, though a considerable part of our county was among the wildest and most desolate districts that are to be sound in South Britain. Mr. Falkland was sometimes seen climbing among the rocks, reclining motionless for hours together upon the edge of a precipice, or lulled into a kind of nameless lethargy of despair by the dashing of the torrents. He would remain for whole nights together under the naked cope of heaven, inatten∣tive to the consideration either of place or time, insensible to the variations of the weather, or rather seeming to be delighted with that uproar of the elements which partially called off his attention from the discord and dejection which occupied his own mind.</P>
<P>At first, when we received intelligence at any time of the place to which Mr. Falkland had with∣drawn himself, some person of his houshold, Mr. Collins or myself, but most generally myself, as I was always at home, and always in the received sense of that word at leisure, went to him to per∣suade him to return. But after a few experiments we thought it adviseable to desist, and to leave my master to prolong his absence, or to terminate it, as might happen to suit his own inclination. Mr. Collins, whose grey hairs and long services seemed to give him a sort of right to be importunate, sometimes succeeded; though even in that case there was nothing that could sit more uneasy upon Mr. Falkland than this insinuation as if he wanted a guardian to take care of him, or as if he were, or were in danger of, falling into a state in which he would be incapable of deliberately controuling
<PB N="174" REF="028752_0176_0FDBF0DE1201CD60"/>
his own words and actions. At one time he would sullenly yield to his humble, venerable friend, murmuring grievously at the constraint that was put upon him, but without spirit enough even to complain of it with energy. At another time, even though complying, he would suddenly burst out in a paroxysm of resentment. Upon these oc∣casions there was something inconceivably, savagely terrible in his anger, that gave to the person against whom it was directed the most humiliating and insupportable sensations. Me he always treated at these times with fierceness, and drove me from him with a vehemence, lofty, emphatical and sus∣tained beyond any thing of which I should have thought human nature to be capable. These sal∣lies seemed always to constitute a sort of crisis in his indisposition; and, whenever he was induced to such a premature return, he would fall imme∣diately after into a state of the most melancholy in∣activity, in which he usually continued for two or three days. It was by an obstinate fatality that, whenever I saw Mr. Falkland in these deplorable situations, and particularly when I lighted upon him after having sought him among the rocks and precipices, pale, emaciated, solitary and haggard, the suggestion would continually recur to me, in spite of inclination, in spite of persuasion, and in spite of evidence, Surely this man is a murderer!</P>

<PB N="175" REF="028752_0177_0FDBF12494CF4540"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. XVII.</HEAD>
<P>IT was in one of the lucid intervals, as I may term them, that occurred during this period, that a peasant was brought before him, in his character of a justice of peace, upon an accusation of having murdered his fellow. As Mr. Falkland had by this time acquired the repute of a melancholy valetudi∣narian, it is probable he would not have been called upon to act in his official character upon the pre∣sent occasion, had it not been that two or three of the neighbouring justices were all of them from home at once, so that he was the only one to be found in a circuit of many miles. The reader however must not imagine, though I have em∣ployed the word insanity in describing Mr. Falk∣land's symptoms, that he was by any means reckoned for a madman by the generality of those who had occasion to observe him. It is true that his behaviour at certain times was singular and un∣accountable; but then at other times there was in it so much dignity, regularity and economy; he knew so well how to command and make himself respected; his actions and carriage were so conde∣scending, considerate and benevolent; that, far from having forfeited the esteem of the unfortu∣nate or the many, they were loud and earnest in his praises.</P>
<P>I was present at the examination of this peasant. The moment I heard of the errand which had brought this rabble of visitors, a sudden thought struck me. I conceived the possibility of rendering
<PB N="176" REF="028752_0178_0FDBF0DF6E40C648"/>
the incident subordinate to the great enquiry which drank up all the currents of my soul. I said, This man is arraigned of murder, and murder is the master-key that wakes distemper in the mind of Mr. Falkland. I will watch him without remission. I will trace all the mazes of his thought. Surely at such a time his secret anguish must betray itself. Surely, if it be not my own fault, I shall now be able to discover the true state of his plea before the tribunal of unerring justice.</P>
<P>I took my station in a manner most favourable to the object upon which my mind was intent. I could perceive in Mr. Falkland's features as he en∣tered a strong reluctance to the business in which he was engaged; but there was no possibility of re∣treating. His countenance was embarrassed and anxious; he scarcely saw any body. The exami∣nation had not proceeded far before he chanced to turn his eye to the part of the room where I was. It happened in this, as in some preceding in∣stances; we exchanged a silent look by which we told volumes to each other. Mr. Falkland's com∣plexion turned from red to pale, and from pale to red. I perfectly understood his feelings, and would willingly have withdrawn myself. But it was impossible; my passions were too deeply en∣gaged; I was rooted to the spot: though my own life, that of my master, or almost of a whole na∣tion had been at stake, I had no power to change my position.</P>
<P>The first surprise however having subsided, Mr. Falkland assumed a look of determined constancy, and even seemed to increase in self-possession much beyond what could have been expected from his first entrance. This he could probably have main∣tained, had it not been that the scene, instead of being permanent, was in some sort perpetually changing. The man who was brought before him
<PB N="177" REF="028752_0179_0FDBF12639A04608"/>
was vehemently accused by the brother of the de∣ceased as having acted from the most rooted ma∣lice. He swore that there had been an old grudge between the parties, and related several instances of it. He affirmed that the murderer had sought the earliest opportunity of wreaking his revenge, had struck the first blow, and, though the contest was in appearance only a common boxing match, had watched the occasion of giving a fatal stroke which was followed by the instant death of his antagonist.</P>
<P>While the accuser was giving in his evidence, the accused discovered every token of the most poignant sensibility. At one time his features were convulsed with anguish, tears unbidden rolled down his manly cheeks; and at another be started with astonishment at the unfavourable turn that was given to the narrative, though without betraying any impatience to interrupt. I never saw a man less ferocious in his appearance. He was tall, well made and comely. His countenance was ingenu∣ous and benevolent, without folly. By his side stood a young woman, his sweetheart, extremely agreeable in her person, and her looks testifying how deeply she interested herself in the fate of her lover. The accidental spectators were divided between indignation against the enormity of the supposed criminal, and compassion for the poor girl that accompanied him. They seemed to take little notice of the favourable appearances visible in the person of the accused, till in the sequel those appearances were more forcibly suggested to their attention. For Mr. Falkland, he was at one moment engrossed by curiosity and earnestness to investigate the tale, while at another be betrayed a sort of revulsion of sentiment which made the investigation too painful for him to support.</P>
<P>When the accused was called upon for his de∣fence, he readily owned the misunderstanding that
<PB N="178" REF="028752_0180_0FDBF0E3183812C0"/>
had existed, and that the deceased was the worst enemy he had in the world. Indeed he was his only enemy, and he could not tell the reason that had made him so. He had employed every possi∣ble effort to overcome his animosity, but in vain. The deceased had upon all occasions sought to mor∣tify him, and do him an ill turn; but he had re∣solved never to be engaged in a broil with him, and till this day he had succeeded. If he had met with a misfortune with any other man, people at least might have thought it matter of accident; but now it would always be believed that he had acted from secret malice and a bad heart.</P>
<P>The fact was that he and his sweetheart had gone to a neighbouring fair, where this man had met them. The man had often tried to affront him, and his passiveness, interpreted into cowardice, had perhaps encouraged the other to additional rude∣ness. Finding that he had endured trivial insults to himself with an even temper, the deceased now thought proper to turn his brutality upon the young woman that accompanied him. He pursued them; he endeavoured in various manners to harrass and vex them; they had sought in vain to shake him off. The young woman was considerably terrified. The accused expostulated with their persecutor, and asked him how he could be so barbarous as to per∣sist in frightening a woman? He replied with an insulting tone, Then the woman should find some one able to protect her; people that encouraged and trusted to such a thief as that, deserved no better! The accused tried every expedient he could invent; at length he could endure it no longer; he became exasperated, and challenged the assail∣ant. The challenge was accepted; a ring was formed; he confided the care of his sweet-heart to a bystander; and unfortunately the first blow he struck proved fatal.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="028752_0181_0FDBF12C6D0D18A8"/>
The accused added that he did not care what became of him. He had been anxious to go through the world in an inoffensive manner, and now he had the guilt of blood upon him. He did not know but it would be a kindness in them to hang him out of the way; for his conscience would re∣proach him as long as he lived, and the figure of the deceased, as he had laid senseless and without motion at his feet, would perpetually haunt him. The thought of this man, at one moment full of life and vigour, and the next lifted a helpless corpse from the ground, and all owing to him, was a thought too dreadful to be endured. He had loved the poor maiden who had been the innocent occa∣sion of this with all his heart, but from this time he should never support the sight of her. The sight would bring a tribe of fiends in its rear. One unlucky minute had poisoned all his hopes, and made life a burden to him.—Saying this his coun∣tenance fell, the muscles of his face trembled with agony, and he looked the statue of depair.</P>
<P>This was the story of which Mr. Falkland was called upon to be the auditor. Though the incidents were for the most part wide of those which be∣longed to the adventures we have just related, and there had been much less policy and skill dis∣played on either part in this rustic encounter, yet there were many points which, to a man who bore the former strongly in his recollection, suggested a sufficient resemblance. These points perpetually smote upon the heart of Mr. Falkland. He at one time started with astonishment, and at another shift∣ed his posture like a man who is unable longer to endure the sensations that press upon him. Then he new-strung his nerves to stubborn patience. I could see, while his muscles preserved an inflexible steadiness, tears of unbidden anguish roll down his cheeks. He dared not trust his eyes to glance to∣wards
<PB N="180" REF="028752_0182_0FDBF0E4134D3538"/>
the side of the room where I stood; and this gave an air of embarrassment to his whole figure. But, when the accused came to speak of his own feelings, to describe the depth of his compunction for an involuntary fault, he could endure it no longer. He suddenly rose, and with every mark of horror and despair rushed out of the room.</P>
<P>This circumstance made no material difference in the affair of the accused. The parties were de∣tained about half an hour. Mr. Falkland had al∣ready heard the material parts of the evidence in person. At the expiration of that interval, he sent for Mr. Collins out of the room. The story of the culprit was confirmed by many witnesses who had seen the transaction. Word was brought that my master was indisposed, and at the same time the accused was ordered to be discharged. The ven∣geance of the brother however, as I afterwards un∣derstood, did not rest here, and he sound a magi∣strate more scrupulous or more despotic, by whom the culprit was committed.</P>
<P>This affair was no sooner concluded than I hasten∣ed into the garden, and plunged into the deepest of its thickets. My mind was full almost to bursting. I no sooner conceived myself sufficiently removed from all observation, than my thoughts forced their way spontaneously to my tongue, and I exclaimed in a sit of uncontroulable enthusiasm: "This is the murderer! the Hawkinses were innocent! I am sure of it! I will pledge my life of it! It is out! It is discovered! Guilty upon my soul!"</P>
<P>While I thus proceeded with hasty steps along the most secret paths of the garden, and from time to time gave vent to the tumult of my thoughts in involuntary exclamations, I felt as if my animal system had undergone a total revolution. My blood boiled within me. I was conscious to a kind of rap∣ture for which I could not account. I was solemn,
<PB N="181" REF="028752_0183_0FDBF12D92A141B0"/>
yet full of rapid emotion, burning with indigna∣tion and energy. In the very tempest and hurri∣cane of the passions, I seemed to enjoy the most soul-ravishing calm. I cannot better express the then state of my mind, than by saying, I was ne∣ver so perfectly alive as at that moment.</P>
<P>This state of mental elevation continued for se∣veral hours, but at length subsided and gave place to more deliberate reflection. One of the first questions that then occurred was, What shall I do with the knowlege I have been so eager to acquire? I had no inclination to turn informer. I felt, what I had had no previous conception of, that it was possible to love a murderer, and, as I then under∣stood it, the worst of murderers. I conceived it to be in the highest degree absurd and iniquitous to cut off a man qualified for the most essential and extensive utility merely out of retrospect to an act which, whatever were its merits, could not now be retrieved.</P>
<P>This thought led me to another which had at first passed unnoticed. If I had been disposed to turn informer, what had occurred amounted to no evidence that was admissible in a court of justice. Well then, added I, if it be such as would not be admitted at a criminal tribunal, am I sure it is such as I ought to admit? There were twenty persons beside myself present at the scene from which I pre∣tend to derive such entire conviction. Not one of them saw it in the light that I did. It either ap∣peared to them a casual and unimportant circum∣stance, or they thought it sufficiently accounted for by Mr. Falkland's infirmity and misfortunes. Did it really contain such an extent of arguments and application, that nobody but I was discerning enough to see?</P>
<P>But all this reasoning produced no alteration in my way of thinking. For this time I could not
<PB N="182" REF="028752_0184_0FDBF0E6544911C8"/>
get it out of my mind for a moment: "Mr. Falk∣land is the murderer! He is guilty! I see it! I feel it! I am sure of it!" Thus was I hurried along by an uncontroulable destiny. The state of my passions in their progressive career, the inquisitive∣ness and impatience of my thoughts, appeared to make this determination unavoidable.</P>
<P>An incident occured while I was in the garden, that seemed to make no impression upon me at the time, but which I recollected when my thoughts were got into somewhat of a slower motion. In the midst of one of my paroxysms of exclamation, and when I thought myself most alone, the shadow of a man as avoiding me passed transiently by me at a small distance. Though I had scarcely caught a faint glimpse of his person, there was something in the occurrence that persuaded me it was Mr. Falkland. I shuddered at the possibility of his having overheard the words of my soliloquy. But this idea, alarming as it was, had not power im∣mediately to suspend the career of my reflections. Subsequent circumstances however brought back the apprehension to my mind. I had scarcely a doubt of its reality, when dinner time came, and Mr. Falkland was not to be found. Supper and bed-time passed in the same manner. The only conclusion made by his servants upon this circum∣stance was, that he was gone upon one of his ac∣customed melancholy rambles.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>THE period at which my story is now arrived seemed as if it were the very crisis of the fortune of Mr. Falkland. Incident followed upon incident in a kind of breathless succession. About nine o'clock the next morning an alarm was given that one of the chimnies of the house was on fire. No accident could be apparently more trivial; but pre∣sently it blazed with such fury, as to make it clear that some beam of the house, which in the first building had been improperly placed, had been reached by the flames. Some danger was appre∣hended for the whole edifice. The confusion was the greater, in consequence of the absence of the master, as well as of Mr. Collins, the steward. While some of the domestics were employed in endeavouring to extinguish the flames, it was thought proper that others should busy themselves in removing the most valuable moveables to a lawn in the garden. I took some command in the affair, to which indeed my station in the family seemed to entitle me, and for which I was thought qua∣lified by my understanding and mental resources.</P>
<P>Having given some general directions, I con∣ceived that it was not enough to stand by and su∣perintend, but that I should contribute my personal labour in the public concern. I set out for that purpose; and my steps by some mysterious fatality were directed to the private apartment at the end of the library. Here, as I looked round, my eye
<PB N="184" REF="028752_0186_0FDBF0EA75F01718"/>
was suddenly caught by the chest mentioned in the first pages of my narrative.</P>
<P>My mind was already raised to its utmost pitch. In a window-seat of the room lay a parcel of chis∣sels and other carpenter's tools. I know not what infatuation instantaneously seized me. The idea was too powerful to be resisted. I forgot the busi∣ness upon which I came, the employment of the servants and the urgency of general danger. I should have done the same, if the apartment round me had been in flames. I snatched a tool suitable for the purpose, threw myself upon the ground, and applied with eagerness to a magazine which inclosed all for which my heart panted. After two or three efforts, in which the energy or uncontroul∣able passion was added to my bodily strength, the fastenings gave way, the chest opened, and all that I sought was at once within my reach.</P>
<P>I was in the act of lifting up the lid, when Mr. Falkland entered, wild, breathless, distraction in his looks! He had been brought home from a con∣siderable distance by the sight of the flames. At the moment of his appearance the lid dropt down from my hand. He no sooner saw me, than his eyes emitted sparks of rage. He ran with eager∣ness to a brace of loaded pistols which hung up in the room, and, seizing one, presented it to my head. I saw his design, and sprang to avoid it; but with the same rapidity with which he had form∣ed his resolution, he changed it, and instantly went to the window and slung the pistol into the court below. He bade me begone with his usual irresisti∣ble energy; and, overcome as I was already by the horror of the detection, I eagerly complied.</P>
<P>A moment after a considerable part of the chim∣ney was tumbled with noise into the court below, and a voice exclaimed that the fire was more vio∣lent than ever. These circumstances seemed to
<PB N="185" REF="028752_0187_0FDBF13450D30D78"/>
produce a mechanical effect upon my master, who, having first locked the closet, appeared on the out∣side of the house, ascended the roof, and was in a moment in every place where his presence was re∣quired. The flames were presently extinguished.</P>
<P>The reader can with difficulty form a concep∣tion of the state to which I was now reduced. My act was in some sort an act of insanity; but how undescribable are the feelings with which I looked back upon it! It was an instantaneous impulse, a short lived and passing alienation of mind; but what must Mr. Falkland think of that alienation? To any man a person, who had once shown him∣self capable of so wild a flight of the mind, must appear dangerous; how must he appear to a man under Mr. Falkland's circumstances? I had just had a pistol held to my head by a man resolved to put a period to my existence. That indeed was past; but what was it that fate had yet in reserve for me! The insatiable vengeance of a Falkland, of a man whose hands were to my apprehension red with blood and his thoughts familiar with cru∣elty and murder. How great were the resources of his mind, resources henceforth to be confede∣rated for my destruction! This was the termina∣tion of an ungoverned curiosity, an impulse that I had represented to myself as so innocent and so venial.</P>
<P>In the high tide of boiling passion I had over∣looked all consequences. It now appeared to me like a dream. Is it in man to leap from the high∣raised precipice, or rush unconcerned into the midst of flames? Was it possible I could have forgotten for a moment the awe-creating manners of Falk∣land, and the inexorable fury I should awake in his soul? No thought of future security had reach∣ed my mind. I had acted upon no plan. I had conceived no means of concealing my deed, after
<PB N="186" REF="028752_0188_0FDBF0EC567F9520"/>
it had once been effected. But it was over now. One short minute had effected a reverse in my situ∣ation, the suddenness of which the history of man perhaps is unable to surpass.</P>
<P>I have always been at a loss to account for my having plunged thus headlong into an act so mon∣strous. There is something in it of unremarked and involuntary sympathy. One sentiment flows by necessity of nature into another sentiment of the same general character. This was the first in∣stance in which I had witnessed a danger by fire. All was confusion around me, and all changed in∣to hurricane within. The general situation to my unpractised apprehension partook of desperate, and I by contagion became alike desperate. At first I had been in some degree calm and collected, but that too was a desperate effort, and when it gave way, a kind of instant insanity became its suc∣cessor.</P>
<P>I had now every thing to fear. And yet what was my fault? It proceeded from none of those errors which are justly held up to the aversion of mankind; my object had been neither wealth, nor the means of indulgence, nor the usurpation of power. No spark of malignity had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arboured in my soul. I had always reverenced the sublime mind of Mr. Falkland; I reverenced it still. My offence had merely been a mistaken thirst of know∣ledge. Such however it was as to admit neither of forgiveness nor remission. This epoch was the crisis of my fate, dividing what may be called the offensive part, from the defensive which was the sole business of my remaining years. Alas, my offence was short, not aggravated by any sinister intention: but the reprisals I was to suffer, are long, and can terminate only with my life!</P>
<P>In the state in which I found myself, when the recollection of what I had done flowed back upon
<PB N="187" REF="028752_0189_0FDBF139AF19C128"/>
my mind, I was incapable of any resolution. All was chaos and uncertainty within me. My thoughts were too full of horror to be susceptible of activity. I felt deserted of my intellectual powers, palsied in mind, and compelled to sit in speechless expecta∣tion of the misery to which I was destined. To my own conception I was like a man, who, though blasted with lightning and deprived for ever of the power of motion, should yet retain the conscious∣ness of his situation. Death-dealing despair was the only idea of which I was sensible.</P>
<P>I was still in this situation of mind when Mr. Falkland sent for me. His message roufed me from my trance. In recovering I felt those sickening and loathsome sensations, which a man may be sup∣posed at first to endure who should return from the sleep of death. Gradually I recovered the power of arranging my ideas and directing my steps. I understood that the minute the affair of the chim∣ney was over Mr. Falkland had retired to his own room. It was evening before he ordered me to be called.</P>
<P>I found in him every token of extreme distress, except that there was an air of solemn and sad com∣posure that crowned the whole. For the present all appearance of gloom, stateliness and austerity was gone. As I entered, he looked up, and, see∣ing who it was, ordered me to bolt the door. I obeyed. He himself went round the room, and examined all its other avenue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. He then returned to where I was. I trembled in every joint of my frame. I exclaimed within myself, "What bloody <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> scene has Roscius now to act?"</P>
<P>Williams, said he, in a tone that had more in it of sorrow than resentment, I have attempted your life! I am a wretch devoted to the scorn and execration of mankind!—There he stopped.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="028752_0190_0FDBF0F2277ACFC0"/>
If there be one being in the whole earth, that feels the scorn and execration due to such a wretch more strongly than another, it is myself. I have been kept in a state of perpetual torture and mad∣ness. But I can put an end to it and its conse∣quences; and, so far at least as relates to you, I am determined to do it. I know the price, and—I will make the purchase.</P>
<P>You must swear, said he. You must attest every sacrament, divine and human, never to disclose what I am now to tell you.—He dictated the oath, and I repeated it with an aching heart. I had no power to offer a word of remark.</P>
<P>This confidence, said he, is of your seeking, not of mine. It is odious to me, as it is dangerous to you.</P>
<P>Having thus prefaced the disclosure he had to make, he paused. He seemed to collect himself as for an effort of magnitude. He wiped his face with his handkerchief. The moisture that incom∣moded him appeared not to be tears, but sweat.</P>
<P>Look at me. Observe me. Is it not strange that such a one as I should retain lineaments of a human creature? I am the blackest of villains. I am the murderer of Tyrrel. I am the assassin of the Hawkinses.</P>
<P>I started, as if I had trod upon a rattle-snake.</P>
<P>What a story is mine! Insulted, disgraced, pol∣luted in the face of hundreds, I was capable of any act of desperation. I watched my opportunity, followed Mr. Tyrrel from the rooms, seized a sharp-pointed knife that fell in my way, came behind him, and stabbed him to the heart. My gigantic oppressor rolled at my feet.</P>
<P>All are but links of one chain. A blow! A murder! My next business was to defend myself, to tell so well digested a lie, as that all mankind
<PB N="189" REF="028752_0191_0FDBF13ED34BB668"/>
should believe it true. Never was a task so har∣rowing and intolerable!</P>
<P>Well: thus far fortune favoured me. She fa∣voured me beyond my desire. The guilt was re∣moved from me, and cast upon another; but this I was to endure. Whence came the circumstantial evidence against him, the broken knife and the blood, I am unable to tell. I suppose by some mi∣raculous accident he was passing by, and endea∣voured to assist his oppressor in the agonies of death. You have heard Hawkins's story; you have read one of his letters. But you do not know the thousandth part of the proofs of his simple and unalterable rectitude that I have known. His son suffered with him, that son for the sake of whose happiness and virtue he ruined himself, and would have died a hundred times.—I have had feelings, but I cannot describe them.</P>
<P>This it is to be a gentleman! a man of honour! I was the fool of fame. My virtue, my honesty, my everlasting peace of mind were cheap sacrifices to be made at the shine of this divinity. But, what is worse, there is nothing that has happened that has in any degree contributed to my cure. I am as much the fool of fame as ever, I cling to it to my last breath. Though I be the blackest of villains, I will leave behind me a spotless and il∣lustrious name. There is no crime so malignant, no scene of blood so horrible, in which that object cannot engage me. It is no matter that I regard these things at a distance with aversion;—I am sure of it; bring me to the test, and I shall yield. I despise myself; but thus I am; things are gone too far to be recalled.</P>
<P>Why is it that I am compelled to this confi∣dence? From the love of fame. I should tremble at the sight of every pistol, or instrument of death that offered itself to my hands; and perhaps my
<PB N="190" REF="028752_0192_0FDBF0F3135E86D0"/>
next murder may not be so fortunate as those I have already committed. I had no alternative but to make you my confident or my victim. It was better to trust you with the whole truth under every seal of secrecy, than to live in perpetual fear of your penetration or your rashness.</P>
<P>Do you know what it is you have done? To gratify a foolishly inquisitive humour you have sold yourself. You shall continue in my service, but can never share in my affection. I will bene∣fit you in respect of fortune, but I shall always hate you. If ever an unguarded word escape from your lips, if ever you excite my jealousy or suspi∣cion, expect to pay for it by your death or worse. It is a dear bargain you have made. But it is too late to look back. I charge and adjure you by every thing that is sacred and that is tremendous, preserve your faith!</P>
<P>My tongue has now for the first time for several years spoken the language of my heart; and the intercourse from this hour shall be shut for ever. I want no pity. I desire no consolation. Sur∣rounded as I am with horrors, I will at least pre∣serve my fortitude to the last. If I had been re∣served to a different destiny, I have qualities in that respect worthy of a better cause. I can be mad, miserable and frantic, but even in frenzy I can pre∣serve my presence of mind and discretion.</P>
<P>Such was the story I had been so earnestly de∣sirous to know. Though my mind had brooded upon the subject for months, there was not a syl∣lable of it that did not come to my ear with the most perfect sense of novelty. Mr. Falkland is a murderer! said I, as I retired from the conference. This dreadful appellative "a murderer," made my very blood run cold within me. He killed Mr. Tyrrel, for he could not controul his resentment and anger: he sacrificed Hawkins the elder and
<PB N="191" REF="028752_0193_0FDBF140512A4598"/>
Hawkins the younger, because he could upon no terms endure the public loss of honour: how can I expect that a man thus passionate and unrelenting will not sooner or later make me his victim?</P>
<P>But notwithstanding this terrible application of the story, an application to which perhaps in some form or other mankind are indebted for nine-tenths of their abhorrence against vice, I could not help occasionally recurring to reflections of an opposite nature. Mr. Falkland is a murderer! resumed I. He might yet be a most excellent man, if he did but think so. It is the thinking ourselves vicious then, that principally contributes to make us vi∣cious?</P>
<P>Amidst the shock I received from finding, what I had never suffered myself constantly to believe, that my suspicions were true; I still discovered new cause of admiration for my master. His menaces indeed were terrible. But, when I re∣collected the offence I had given, so contrary to every received principle of civilized society, so in∣solent and rude, so intolerable to a man of Mr. Falkland's elevation and in Mr. Falkland's pecu∣liarity of circumstances, I was astonished at his forbearance. There were indeed sufficiently ob∣vious reasons why he might not choose to proceed to extremities with me. But how different from the fearful expectations I had conceived were the calmness of his behaviour and the regulated mild∣ness of his language! In this respect I for a short time imagined that I was emancipated from the mischiefs which had appalled me, and that in hav∣ing to do with a man of Mr. Falkland's liberality I had nothing rigorous to apprehend.</P>
<P>It is a miserable prospect, said I, that he holds up to me. He imagines that I am restrained by no principles, and deaf to the claims of personal excellence. But he shall find himself mistaken. I
<PB N="192" REF="028752_0194_0FDBF0F493B66300"/>
will never become an informer. I will never in∣jure my master; and therefore he will not be my enemy. With all his misfortunes and all his er∣rors, I feel that my soul yearns for his welfare. If he have been criminal, that is owing to circum∣stances; the same qualities under other circum∣stances would have been, or rather were sublimely beneficent.</P>
<P>My reasonings were no doubt infinitely more fa∣vourable to my master than those which human beings are accustomed to make in the case of such as they style great criminals. This will not be wondered at, when it is considered that I had my∣self just been trampling on the established boun∣daries of obligation, and therefore might well have a fellow-feeling for other offenders. Add to which, I had known Mr. Falkland from the first as a beneficent divinity. I had observed at leisure and with a minuteness which could not deceive me the excellent qualities of his heart, and I found him possessed of a mind beyond comparison the most fertile and accomplished I had ever known.</P>
<P>But, though the terrors which had impressed me were considerably alleviated, my situation was not∣withstanding sufficiently miserable. The ease and light-heartedness of my youth were for ever gone. The voice of an irresistible necessity had command∣ed me to "sleep no more." I was tormented with a conscious secret of which I must never disbur∣then myself; and this consciousness was at my age a source of perpetual melancholy. I had made myself a prisoner, in the most intolerable sense of that term, for years, perhaps for the rest of my life. Though my prudence and discretion should be invariable, I must remember that I should have an overseer, vigilant from conscious guilt, full of resentment at the unjustifiable means by which I had extorted from him a confession, and whose
<PB N="193" REF="028752_0195_0FDBF14474E08B78"/>
lightest caprice might at any time decide upon every thing that was dear to me. The vigilance even of a public and systematical despotism is poor, com∣pared with a vigilance which is thus goaded by the most anxious passions of the soul. Against this species of persecution I knew not how to invent a refuge. I dared neither fly from the observation of Mr. Falkland, nor continue exposed to its opera∣tion. I was at first indeed lulled in a certain de∣gree to security upon the verge of the precipice. But it was not long before I found a thousand cir∣cumstances perpetually reminding me of my true situation. Those I am now to relate are among the most memorable.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX.</HEAD>
<P>IN no long time after the disclosure Mr. Falkland had made. Mr. Forester, his elder brother by the mother's side, came to reside for a short period in our family. This was a circumstance peculiarly adverse to my master's habits and inclinations. He had broken off, as I have already said, all inter∣course of visiting his neighbours. He debarred himself every kind of amusement and relaxation. He shrunk from the society of his fellows, and thought he could never be sufficiently buried in obscurity and solitude. This principle was in most cases of no difficult execution to a man of firmness. But Mr. Falkland knew not how to avoid the visit of Mr. Forester. This gentleman was just return∣ed from a residence of several years upon the con∣tinent, and his demand of an apartment in the house of his half-brother till his own house at the distance of thirty miles should be prepared for his reception, was made with an air of confidence that scarcely admitted of a refusal. Mr. Falkland could only say that the state of his health and spirits was such, that he feared a residence at his house would be little agreeable to his kinsman; and Mr. Fores∣ter conceived that this was a disqualification which would always augment in proportion as it was tolerated, and hoped that his society, by inducing Mr. Falkland to suspend his habits of seclusion, would be the means of essential benefit. Mr. Falk∣land opposed him no farther. He would have been sorry to be thought unkind to a kinsman for
<PB N="195" REF="028752_0197_0FDBF145B6B5C878"/>
whom he had a particular esteem; and the consci∣ousness of not daring to assign the true reason, made him cautious of adhering to his objection.</P>
<P>The character of Mr. Forester was in many respects the reverse of that of my master. Like him he had seen much of the world; but to judge of him from the unfashioned bluntness of his manner, you would have thought he had never stirred from his fire-side. Yet under this rude ex∣terior it was easy to distinguish various knowledge, nice discrimination, and a strong and active mind. Nor was it ill-humour or misanthropy that gave this turn to Mr. Forester's behaviour. He disclaimed exaggeration of every kind, and was equally averse to the cynic who paints every thing in the most splenetic colours, and the sanguine enthusiast to whom the whole appears to be exactly as it ought. In the mean time, while he hated exaggeration, he was himself one of its grossest dupes. He was positive in all things, even where good sense re∣quired him to be sceptical; and he roughly imputed perverseness, where true wisdom would have taught him to correct mistake. The same incon∣sistency followed him throughout. Full of origi∣nality and genius, he pretended to despise them in others. His favourite principle was to care nothing for what the world should say, and to aim only at doing right. So long as that debt was discharged, he would not stoop to purchase, at the expence of moving a finger, the applause of mankind in prefe∣rences to their hatred. He believed that the credit which is sometimes given to men of ability, was the dishonest gains of a combination, not the just reward of merit; and he took pleasure in stating this opinion in its harshest form. He held that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> honest ploughman is a more useful member of society, than all the poets and philosophers that ever existed. In a word, Mr. Forester was one of
<PB N="196" REF="028752_0198_0FDBF17714C5AC38"/>
those men who, with every seeming requisite for the discovery of important truth, are all their lives in subjection to the most contemptible prejudices.</P>
<P>The peculiarities of this gentleman's character were not undisplayed in the scene to which he was now introduced. Having much kindness in his dis∣position, he soon became deeply interested in the unhappiness of his relation. He did every thing in his power to remove it; but his attempts were rude and unskilful. He exhorted his host to pluck up a spirit, and defy the foul fiend; but the tone of his exhortations found no sympathetic chord in the mind of Mr. Falkland. The more he ex∣plained the articles of his creed, the more irrecon∣cileable did they appear with those of my master. He had not the skill to carry conviction to an un∣derstanding so well fortified in error; and the less so as the effort of his reflections had long been turned to a bold and intelligible enunciation of principles, rather than to analysing the rudiments out of which they were formed. In a word, after a thousand efforts of kindness to his entertainer, he drew off his forces, growling and dissatisfied with his own impotence, rather than angry at the obstinacy of Mr. Falkland. He felt no diminution of his affection for him, and was sincerely grieved to find that he did him so little good. Both par∣ties in this case did justice to the merits of the other; at the same time that the disparity of their humours was such as to prevent the stranger from being even a dangerous companion to the master of the house. They had scarcely any points of contact in their characters; Mr. Forester was in∣capable of giving Mr. Falkland that degree either of pain or pleasure, which can raise the soul into a tumult and deprive it for a while of tranquillity and self-command.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="028752_0199_0FDBD6CA72C183D8"/>
Our visitor was a man of an extremely commu∣nicative disposition, and he began to feel himself painfully out of his element upon the present oc∣casion. Mr. Falkland was devoted to contempla∣tion and solitude. He put upon himself some de∣gree of restraint upon the arrival of his kinsman, though even then his darling habits would break out. But when they had seen each other a certain number of times, and it was sufficiently evident that the society of either would be a burthen rather than a pleasure to the other, they consented by a sort of silent compact that each should be at liberty to follow his own inclination. Mr. Falkland was in a certain sense the greatest gainer by this. He returned to the habits of his choice, and acted as nearly as possible just as he would have done if Mr. Forester had not been in existence. But the latter was wholly at a loss. He had all the disadvantages of retirement, without being able, as he might have done at his house, to bring his own associates or his own amusements about him.</P>
<P>In this situation he cast his eyes upon me. It was his principle to do every thing that his thoughts suggested, without caring for the forms of the world. He saw no reason why a peasant, with certain advantages of education and opportunity, might not be as eligible a companion as a lord: at the same time that he was deeply impressed with the venerableness of old institutions. Reduced as he was to a kind of last resort, he sound me better qualified for his purpose than any other person of Mr. Falkland's houshold. My habitual simplicity was extremely agreeable to him: and, be it ob∣served by the way, he loved to countenance the appearance of talents, while he professed to be their enemy.</P>
<P>The manner in which he began this sort of cor∣respondence was sufficiently characteristical. It
<PB N="198" REF="028752_0200_0FDBF149C04B12C0"/>
was abrupt; but it was strongly stamped with essen∣tial benevolence. It was blunt and humorous; but there was attractiveness, especially in a case of un∣equal intercourse, in that very rusticity by which he levelled himself with the great bulk of his spe∣cies. He had to reconcile himself, as well as to invite me; not to reconcile himself to the post∣poning an aristocratical vanity, for of that he had a very slender portion, but to the trouble of invi∣tation, for he loved his ease. All this produced some irregularity and indecision in his own mind, and gave a very whimsical impression to his beha∣viour.</P>
<P>On my part I was by no means ungrateful for the distinction that was paid me. My mind had been relaxed into temporary dejection, but my re∣serve had no alloy of moroseness or insensibility. It did not long hold out against the condescending attentions of Mr. Forester. I became gradually heedful, encouraged, confiding. I had a most eager thirst for the knowledge of mankind; and, though no person perhaps ever purchased so dearly the instructions he received in that school, the in∣clination was in no degree diminished. Mr. Fo∣rester was the second man I had seen who seemed almost as much worth being studied as Mr. Falk∣land himself. I was glad to escape from the un∣easiness of my thoughts; and, while engaged with this new friend, I forgot the criticalness of the evils with which I was hourly menaced.</P>
<P>Stimulated by these feelings on either part we were never at a loss for subjects of conversation. The observations Mr. Forester had made in his travels, the set of opinions he had formed to him∣self, all amused and interested me. His manner of telling a story or explaining his thoughts was forcible, perspicuous and original: his style in con∣versation had an uncommon zest, which while it
<PB N="199" REF="028752_0201_0FDBF17D4BB8B3B0"/>
seemed to disdain ornament, was unconsciously in∣terspersed with the boldest figures; and often wan∣dered into all the vehemence of oratory, while it affected to be blunt, simple, and abrupt. Nor was the part I sustained upon these occasions with∣out its recommendations. I received the commu∣nications of my friend with an ingenuous and un∣prejudiced mind. If I objected to any of his views, my objections were not drawn from the stores of common place, and had therefore the grace of novelty. And I may venture to say that my objections depended more for effect upon their inherent value, than upon any positiveness and pa∣rade with which they were announced.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland was destined to be for ever un∣happy; and it seemed as if no new incident could occur from which he was not able to extract food for this imperious propensity. He was wearied with a perpetual repetition of similar impressions, and entertained an invincible disgust against all that was new. The visit of Mr. Forester he regarded with antipathy. He was scarcely able to look at him without shuddering; an emotion which his guest perceived, and pitied as the result of habit and disease rather than of judgment. None of his actions passed unremarked; the most indifferent excited uneasiness and apprehension. No sooner had the first overtures of a sort of intimacy be∣tween me and Mr. Forester taken place, than they probably gave birth to sentiments of jealousy in the mind of my master. It was not long before he intimated to me that it would not be agreeable to him that there should be too much intercourse be∣tween me and his visitor.</P>
<P>What could I do? Young as I was, could it be expected that I should play the philosopher, and put a perpetual curb upon my inclinations? Im∣prudent though I had been, could I voluntarily
<PB N="200" REF="028752_0202_0FDBF14CCA091398"/>
subject myself to an eternal penance, and estrange∣ment from human society? Could I discourage a frankness so perfectly in consonance with my wishes, and receive in an ungracious way a kind∣ness that stole away my heart?</P>
<P>Beside this, I was but ill prepared for the servile submission Mr. Falkland demanded. In early life I was accustomed to be much my own master. When I first entered into Mr. Falkland's service, my personal habits were checked by the novelty of my situation, and my affections were gained by the high accomplishments of my patron. To novelty and its influence, curiosity had immediately suc∣ceeded. Curiosity, so long as it lasted, was a prin∣ciple stronger in my bosom than even the love of independence. To that I would have sacrificed my liberty or my life; I would have submitted to the condition of a West Indian Negro, or to the tortures inflicted by North American savages. But the turbulence of curiosity had now subsided.</P>
<P>As long as the threats of Mr. Falkland had been confined to generals, I endured it. I was consci∣ous of the unbecoming action I had committed, and this rendered me humble. But, when he went farther, and undertook to prescribe to every article of my conduct, my patience was at an end. He stretched his power beyond the limits of policy and prudence, and thus brought its very existence into question. I believed that nothing which his rage irritated by the most open rebellion could inflict, would be worse than the slavery he now pretended to impose. I had been adventurous in the gratifi∣cation of an infantine and unreasonable curiosity, and I was resolved not to be less adventurous, if need were, in the defence of every thing that can make life a blessing. I was prepared for an amica∣ble adjustment of interests; I would undertake that Mr. Falkland should never sustain injury through
<PB N="201" REF="028752_0203_0FDBF17E95821A80"/>
my means; but I expected in return that I should suffer no incroachment, but be lest to the direction of my own understanding.</P>
<P>I went on then to seek Mr. Forester's society with eagerness; and it is the nature of an inter∣course that does not decline, progressively to in∣crease. Mr. Falkland observed these symptoms with visible perturbation. Whenever I was con∣scious of their being perceived by him, I betrayed tokens of confusion; this did not tend to allay his uneasiness. One day he drew me aside; and, with a look of mysterious, but terrible import, address∣ed me thus:</P>
<P>Young man, take warning! Perhaps this is the last time you shall have an opportunity to take it! I will not always be the butt of your simplicity and inexperience, nor suffer your weakness to triumph over my strength! Why do you trifle with me? You little suspect the extent of my power. At this moment you are surrounded with the engines of my vengeance, and before you are aware they will close upon you. You might as well think of escaping from the reach of the omnipresent God, as from mine! If you could touch so much as my finger, you should expiate it in hours and months and years of a tor∣ment of which as yet you have not the remotest idea! Remember! I am not talking at random! I do not utter a word, that, if you provoke me, shall not be executed to the severest letter!</P>
<P>It may be supposed that these menaces were not without their effect. I withdrew in silence. My whole soul revolted against the treatment I endur∣ed, and yet I could not utter a word. Why could not I speak the expostulations of my heart, or pro∣pose the compromise I meditated? It was inex∣perience, and not want of strength, that awed me. Every act of Mr. Falkland contained some∣thing of new, and I was unprepared to meet it.
<PB N="202" REF="028752_0204_0FDBF14DD1180D88"/>
Perhaps it will be found that the greatest hero owes the propriety of his conduct to the habit of encoun∣tering difficulties and calling out with promptness the energies of his mind.</P>
<P>I contemplated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he proceedings of my master with the deepest astonishment. Humanity and ge∣neral kindness were fundamental parts of his cha∣racter, but in relation to me they were sterile and inactive. His own interest required that he should purchase my kindness; but he preferred to govern me by terror, and watch me with unceasing anxie∣ty. I ruminated with the most mournful sensa∣tions upon the nature of my calamity. I believed that no human being was ever placed in a situation so pitiable as mine. Every atom of my frame seemed to have a several existence, and to crawl within me. I had but too much reason indeed to believe that Mr. Falkland's were not empty words. I knew his ability; I felt his ascendancy. If I en∣countered him, what chance had I of victory? If I were defeated, what was the penalty I had to suffer? Well then, the rest of my life must be de∣voted to slavish subjection? Miserable sentence! And, if it were, what security have I against the injustice of a man, vigilant, capricious and crimi∣nal? I envied the condemned wretch upon the scaffold. I envied the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the inquisition in the midst of his torture. They know what they have to suffer. I have only to imagine every thing terrible, and then say, The fate reserved for me is worse than this!</P>
<P>It was well for me that these sensations were but transient: human nature could not long support it∣self under what I then felt. By degrees my mind shook off its burthen. Indignation succeeded to emotions of terror. The hostility of Mr. Falkland excited hostility in me. I was determined I would never calumniate him in matters of the most trivial
<PB N="203" REF="028752_0205_0FDBF1839D9BC1F8"/>
import; much less betray the grand secret upon which every thing dear to him depended. But, to∣tally abjuring the offensive, I resolved to stand firmly upon the defensive. The liberty of acting as I pleased I would preserve at whatever risque. If I were worsted in the contest, I would at least have the consolation of reflecting that I had exerted myself with energy. In proportion as I thus de∣termined, I drew off my forces from petty incur∣sions, and felt the propriety of acting with preme∣ditation and system. I ruminated incessantly upon plans of deliverance, but I was anxious that my choice should not be precipitately made.</P>
<P>It was during this period of my deliberation and uncertainty that Mr. Forester terminated his visit. He observed a strange distance in my behaviour, and in his good-natured, encouraging way chid me for it. I could only answer with a gloomy look of mysterious import, and a mournful and expressive silence. He sought me for an explanation, but I was now as ingenious in avoiding, as I had before been ardent to seek him; and he quitted our house, as he afterwards told me, with an impression, that there was some ill destiny that hung over it, that seemed fated to make all its inhabitants miser∣able, without its being possible for a by-stander to penetrate the reason.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Forester had left us about three weeks, when Mr. Falkland sent me upon some business to an estate he possessed in a neighbouring county about fifty miles from his principal residence. The road led in a direction wholly wide of the habita∣tion of our late visitor. I was upon my return from the place to which I had been sent, when I began in fancy to take a survey of the various cir∣cumstances of my condition, and by degrees lost in the profoundness of my contemplation all atten∣tion to the surrounding objects. The first deter∣mination of my mind was to escape from the lynx-eyed jealousy and despotism of Mr. Falkland; the second to provide, by every effort of prudence and deliberation I could devise, against the danger with which I well knew my attempt must be accompa∣nied.</P>
<P>Occupied with these meditations, I rode many miles before I perceived that I had totally deviated from the right path. At length I roused myself, and surveyed the horizon round me; but I could observe nothing with which my organ was previ∣ously acquainted. On three sides the heath stretched as far as the eye could reach; on the fourth I discovered at some distance a wood of no ordinary dimensions. Before me scarcely a single track could be found to mark that any human being had ever visited the spot. As the best expedient I could devise, I bent my course towards the wood I have mentioned, and then pursued as well as I
<PB N="205" REF="028752_0207_0FDBF184970858D8"/>
was able the windings of the inclosure. This led me after some time to the end of the heath, but I was still as much at a loss as ever respecting the road I should pursue. The sun was hid from me by a grey and cloudy atmosphere; I was induced to continue along the skirts of the wood, and sur∣mounted with some difficulty the hedges and other obstacles that from time to time presented them∣selves. My thoughts were gloomy and disconso∣late; the dreariness of the day and the solitude which surrounded me seemed to communicate a sadness to my soul. I had proceeded a considerable way, and was quite overcome with hunger and fa∣tigue, when I discovered a road and a little inn at no great distance. I made up to them, and upon enquiry found that, instead of pursuing the proper direction, I had taken one that led to Mr. Fo∣rester's, rather than to my own habitation. I alighted, and was entering the house, when the appearance of that gentleman struck my eyes.</P>
<P>Mr. Forester accosted me with kindness, invited me into the room where he had been sitting, and enquired what accident had brought me to that place. While he was speaking, I could not help recollecting the extraordinary manner in which we were thus once more brought together, and a train of ideas was by this means suggested to my mind. Some refreshment was by Mr. Forester's order pre∣pared for me; I sat down and partook of it. Still this thought dwelt upon my recollection:—Mr. Falkland would never be made acquainted with our meeting; I had an opportunity thrown in my way, which if I did not improve, I should deserve all the consequences that might result. I could now converse with a friend, and a powerful friend, without fear of being watched and overlooked. What wonder that I was tempted to disclose, not Mr. Falkland's secret, but my own situation, and
<PB N="206" REF="028752_0208_0FDBF150D13A3B88"/>
receive the advice of a man of worth and experi∣ence, which might perhaps be adequately done without entering into any detail injurious to my master?</P>
<P>Mr. Forester was forward on his part, to learn why it was that I thought myself unhappy, and why I had avoided him during the latter part of his residence under the same roof, as evidently as I had before taken pleasure in his communications. I told him that I could give him but an imper∣fect satisfaction upon these points, but what I could I would willingly explain. The fact, I pro∣ceeded, was, that there were certain reasons which rendered it impossible for me to have a tranquil moment under the roof of Mr. Falkland. I had revolved the matter again and again in my mind, and was finally convinced that I owed it to my∣self to withdraw from his service. I added, that I was sensible by this half confidence I might ra∣ther seem to merit the disapprobation of Mr. Fo∣rester than his countenance; but I declared my persuasion that, if he could be acquainted with the whole affair, however strange my behaviour might at present appear, he would applaud my re∣serve.</P>
<P>He asked what reason I had to complain of Mr. Falkland? I replied, that I entertained the deepest reverence for my master; I admired his abilities, and considered him as formed for the be∣nefit of his species. I should in my own opi∣nion be the vilest of miscreants, if I uttered a whisper to his disadvantage. But all this did not avail: I was not fit for him; perhaps I was not good enough for him; at all events I must be perpetually miserable so long as I continued to live with him.</P>
<P>I observed Mr. Forester gaze upon me eagerly with curiosity and surprise, but this circumstance I
<PB N="207" REF="028752_0209_0FDBF1861C33F0B0"/>
did not think proper to notice. Having recovered himself, he asked, Why then, that being the case, I did not quit his service? I answered, What he now touched upon was that which most of all con∣tributed to my misfortune. Mr. Falkland was not ignorant of my dislike to my present situation; per∣haps he thought it unreasonable, unjust; but I knew that he would never be brought to consent to my giving way to it.</P>
<P>Here Mr. Forester interrupted me: and, smiling, said, I magnified obstacles, and overrated my own importance, adding that he would undertake to re∣move that difficulty, as well as to provide me with a more agreeable appointment. This suggestion produced in me a serious alarm. I replied, that I must intreat him upon no account to think of ap∣plying to Mr. Falkland upon the subject. I added, that perhaps I was only betraying my own imbeci∣lity; but in reality, unacquainted as I was with experience and the world, I was afraid, though disgusted with my present residence, to expose my∣self upon a mere project of my own, to the resent∣ment of so considerable a man as Mr. Falkland, If he would favour me with his advice upon the subject, or if he would only give me leave to hope for his protection in case of any unforeseen ac∣cident, this was all I presumed to request; and, thus encouraged, I would venture to obey the dic∣tates of my inclination, and fly in pursuit of my lost tranquillity.</P>
<P>Having thus opened myself to this generous friend as far as I could do it with propriety and safety, he sat for some time silent with an air of deep reflection. At length with a countenance of unusual severity he thus addressed me: Young man, I am afraid you are ignorant of the nature of the tale you have been telling me. There is mys∣tery in it; there is something you cannot prevail
<PB N="208" REF="028752_0210_0FDBF154573DB8E8"/>
upon yourself to disclose. Mystery always implies somewhere or other an uncommon portion of wrong; what am I to think of you? Are you aware of the prejudice you are voluntarily creating against yourself thus upon the threshold of life?</P>
<P>I answered that, whatever were the amount of that prejudice, I must submit. I placed my hope of a candid construction in the present instance, in the rectitude of his nature.</P>
<P>He went on: Well, be it as you please. It was absolutely necessary I should tell you what you were doing. I am in some respects the worst person you could have applied to under these circum∣stances. I am the idolator of frankness, and have an unconquerable abhorrence to every thing that is the reverse of it. If any body had told me six months ago that I could have been brought to coun∣tenance a person that practised that reverse, I should not have believed him. But I will tell you fairly the state of my mind. Your conduct in this re∣spect has not, as yet at least; destroyed the early predilection I conceived in your favour. The ba∣lance, so far as I am able at present to adjust it, is with you. I will therefore, though in total oppo∣sition to my principles, yield to this instigation. I put myself into your hands; I will do exactly what you require. I will receive you either now or hereafter under my own roof, trusting that you will not deceive my confidence, and that I shall find unfavourable appearances ultimately terminat∣ing as the man most solicitous for your welfare would desire.</P>
<P>We were engaged in the earnest discussion of subjects thus interesting to my peace, when we were interrupted by an event of all others the most seriously to be deprecated. Without the smallest notice, and as if he had dropped upon us from the clouds, Mr. Falkland burst into the room. I found
<PB N="209" REF="028752_0211_0FDBF18AD7D950F0"/>
afterwards that Mr. Forester had come thus far upon an appointment to meet Mr. Falkland, and that the place of their intended rendezvous was the next stage. Mr. Forester was detained unex∣pectedly at the inn where we now were, by our accidental rencounter, and in reality had for the moment forgotten his appointment; while Mr. Falkland, not finding him where he expected, had proceeded thus far towards the house of his kins∣man. To me the meeting was the most unac∣countable in the world.</P>
<P>I instantly foresaw the dreadful complication of misfortune that was included in this event. To Mr. Falkland the meeting between me and his re∣lation must appear, not accidental, but concerted. I was totally out of the road I had been travelling by his direction; I was in a road that led directly to the house of Mr. Forester. What must he think of this? How must he suppose I came to that place? The truth, if told, that I came there with∣out design, and purely in consequence of having lost my way, must appear to be the most impudent lie that ever was devised.</P>
<P>Here then I stood detected in the fact of that intercourse which had been so severely forbidden. But in this instance it was infinitely worse, than in those which had already given so much disturbance to Mr. Falkland. It was then open, frank and unconcealed; and therefore the presumption was that it was for purposes that required no conceal∣ment. But the present interview, if concerted, was in the most emphatical degree clandestine. Nor was it less perilous than it was clandestine. It had been forbidden with the most dreadful menaces, and Mr. Falkland was not ignorant how deep an impression those menaces had made upon my ima∣gination. Such a meeting therefore could not have been concerted under such circumstances for a tri∣vial
<PB N="210" REF="028752_0212_0FDBF155546A3A10"/>
purpose, or for any purpose that his heart did not quake to think of. Such was the amount of my crime; such was the agony my appearance was calculated to inspire; and it was reasonable to sup∣pose that the penalty I had to expect would be pro∣portionable. The threats of Mr. Falkland still sounded in my ears, and I was in a transport of terror.</P>
<P>The conduct of the same man in different cir∣cumstances is often so various as to render it very difficult to be accounted for▪ Mr. Falkland, in this to him terrible crisis, did not seem to be in any de∣gree hurried away by his passions. For a moment he was dumb, his eyes glared with astonishment; and the next moment as it were, he had the most perfect calmness and self-command. Had it been otherwise I have no doubt that I should instantly have entered into an explanation, the ingenuous∣ness and consistency of which could not but have been in some degree attended with a favourable event. But as it was, I suffered myself to be over∣come; I yielded as in a former instance to the dis∣comfiting influence of surprise. I dared scarcely breathe; I observed the appearances with anxiety and wonder. Mr. Falkland quietly ordered me to return home, and take along with me the groom he had brought with him. I obeyed in silence.</P>
<P>I afterwards understood that he enquired mi∣nutely of Mr. Forester the circumstances of our meeting, and that that gentleman, perceiving that the meeting itself was discovered, and guided by ha∣bits of frankness, which, when once rooted in a character, it is very difficult to counteract, told Mr. Falkland every thing that had passed, together with the remarks it had suggested to his own mind. Mr. Falkland received the communication with an ambiguous and studied silence, which by no means operated to my advantage in the already-poisoned
<PB N="211" REF="028752_0213_0FDBF18D93EAD4C8"/>
mind of Mr. Forester. His silence was partly the direct consequence of a mind watchful, inquisitive and doubting; and partly perhaps was adopted for the sake of the effect it was qualified to produce, Mr. Falkland not being unwilling to encourage a prejudice against the character of a person who might one day become the adversary of his own.</P>
<P>As to me, I went home indeed, for this was not a moment to resist. Mr. Falkland, with a preme∣ditation to which he had artfully given the appear∣ance of accident, had taken care to send with me a guard to attend upon his prisoner. I seemed as if conducting to one of those fortresses, famed in the history of despotism, from which the wretched victim is never known to escape; and, when I en∣tered my chamber, I felt as if I were entering a dungeon. I reflected that I was at the mercy of a man, exasperated at my disobedience, and who was already formed to cruelty by successive murders. I had occasionally indulged in visions of pleasure, authority and honour as the attendants of my ma∣turer years: who has not? especially who, with an imagination as busy and a spirit as ardent as mine? All these prospects were now closed; I was cut off for ever from pursuits that I had meditated with ineffable delight; my death might be the event of a few hours. I was a victim at the shrine of con∣scious guilt that knew neither rest nor satiety; I should be blotted from the catalogue of the living, and my fate remain eternally a secret; the man who added my murder to his former crimes, would show himself the next morning, and be hailed with the admiration and applause of his species.</P>
<P>In the midst of these terrible imaginations one idea presented itself that alleviated my feelings. This was the recollection of the strange and un∣accountable tranquillity which Mr. Falkland had
<PB N="212" REF="028752_0214_0FDBF156DF313EA8"/>
manifested, when he discovered me in company with Mr. Forester. I was not deceived by this. I knew full well that this calm was temporary, and would be succeeded by a tumult and whirlwind of the passions of the most dreadful sort. But a man under the power of such terrors as now occupied me, catches at every reed. I said to myself, that this tranquil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity was a period it was incumbent upon me to improve; and the shorter its duration might be found, the more speedy was I obliged to be in the use of it. I could not endure the thought that the apprehensions I now entertained, should be realised through the neglect of any exer∣tion or even daring on my part. In a word, I took the resolution, because I already stood in fear of the vengeance of Mr. Falkland, to risque the possibility of provoking it in a degree still more inexpiable, and terminate at once my present state of uncertainty. Add to which, I had now opened my case to Mr. Forester, and he had given me posi∣tive assurances of his protection. This in the pre∣sent desperation of my fortune was an idea to which my mind willingly had recourse for support and consolation.—Instigated by these reflections, I sat down to address the following letter to Mr. Falkland.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have conceived the intention of quitting your service. This is a measure we ought both of us to desire. I shall then be, what it is my duty to be, the master of my own actions. You will be delivered from the presence of a person, whom you cannot prevail upon yourself to behold without un∣pleasing emotions.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="028752_0215_0FDBF18E4913AB60"/>
Why should you subject me to an eternal pe∣nance? Why should you consign all my youthful hopes to suffering and despair? Consult the princi∣ples of humanity that have marked the general course of your proceedings, and do not let me, I intreat you, be made the subject of a useless seve∣rity. My heart is impressed with gratitude for your favours. I sincerely ask your forgiveness for the many errors of my conduct. I consider the treat∣ment I have received under your roof as one al∣most uninterrupted scene of kindness and genero∣sity. I shall never forget my obligations to you, and will never betray them.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I remain, SIR, Your most grateful, respectful and dutiful servant, CALEB WILLIAMS.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Such was my employment of the evening of a day, which will be ever memorable in the history of my life. Mr. Falkland not being yet returned, though expected every hour, I was induced to make use of the pretext of fatigue to avoid an in∣terview. I went to bed. The next morning I was informed, that he did not come home till late, that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad enquired for me, and being told that I was in bed, had said nothing farther upon the subject. Satisfied in this respect, I went to the breakfasting parlour, and busied myself for some time in arrang∣ing a few books and some other little occupations, till Mr. Falkland should appear. After a little time I heard his step, which I perfectly knew how to distinguish, in the passage. Presently, he stopped, and, speaking to some one in a sort of deliberate, but smothered voice, I overheard him repeat my
<PB N="214" REF="028752_0216_0FDBF15D9257FBE0"/>
name as enquiring for me. In conformity to the plan I had persuaded myself to adopt, I now laid the letter I had written upon the table, near where he usually sat, and made my exit at one door as Mr. Falkland entered at the other. This done, I withdrew in expectation of the event to a private apartment, a sort of light-closet at the end of the library, where I was accustomed not unfrequently to sit.</P>
<P>I had not been here three minutes when I heard the voice of Mr. Falkland calling me. I went to him in the library. That is your letter, said he, throwing it. His manner was that of a man la∣bouring with some dreadful thought, and endea∣vouring to give an air of carelessness and insensibi∣lity to his behaviour. I think no carriage of any other sort could have produced a sensation of such inexplicable horror, or have excited in the person who was most immediately its object, such an alarm for the event.</P>
<P>My lad, continued he, I believe now you have played almost all your tricks, and, damn me, if the farce be not nearly at an end! With your apish∣ness and absurdity however you have taught me one thing, and, whereas before now I have winced at them with torture, I am now as tough as an elephant. I shall crush you in the end with the same indifference that I would any other little insect that disturbed my serenity.</P>
<P>I believe you have decided your fate. I think myself sure that you will never have done till you have brought my whole weight upon you. You may try however. Your only chance is in passive∣ness. I am now perfectly insensible to every thing you can suffer, but I have no pleasure in it. I will let you alone, if I can.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="028752_0217_0FDBF191975BD3F0"/>
I am unable to tell what brought about your meeting with Mr. Forester yesterday. It might be design; it might be accident. But, be it which it will, I shall not forget it. You write me here, that you are desirous to quit my service. To that I have a short answer, You shall never quit it with life. If you attempt it, you shall never cease to rue your folly as long as you exist. That is my will; and I will not have it resisted. The very next time you disobey me in that or any other ar∣ticle, there is an end of your vagaries for ever. Perhaps your situation may be a pitiable one; it is for you to look to that. I only know that it is in your power to prevent its growing worse; no time nor chance shall ever make it better.</P>
<P>Do not imagine I am afraid of you! I wear an armour, against which all your weapons are impo∣tent. I have dug a pit for you; and, whichever way you move, backward or forward, to the right or to the left, it is ready to swallow you. Be still! If once you fall, call as loud as you will, no man on earth shall hear your cries; prepare a tale ever so plausible, or ever so true, the whole world shall execrate you as an impostor. Your innocence shall be of no service to you; I laugh at so feeble a defence. It is I that say it; you may believe what I tell you. Do you not know, miserable wretch! added he, suddenly altering his tone, and stamping upon the ground with fury, that I have sworn to preserve my reputation at whatever ex∣pence, that I love it more than the whole world and its inhabitants taken together? And do you think that you shall wound it? Begone, miscreant! reptile! and cease to contend with unsurmountable power!</P>
<P>The part of my history which I am now relating is that which I reflect upon with the least compla∣cency.
<PB N="216" REF="028752_0218_0FDBF15D9445C608"/>
Why was it that I was once more totally overcome by the imperious carriage of Mr. Falk∣land, and unable to utter a word? The reader will be presented with many occasions in the sequel in which I wanted neither facility in the invention of expedients, nor fortitude in entering upon my justification. Persecution at length gave firmness to my character, and taught me the better part of manhood. But in the present instance I was irre∣solute, overawed and abashed.</P>
<P>The speech I had heard was the dictate of frenzy, and it created in me a similar frenzy. It deter∣mined me to do the very thing against which I was thus solemnly warned, and fly from my master's house. I could not enter into parley with him; I could no longer endure the vile subjugation he im∣posed on me. It was in vain that my reason came to my aid, and warned me of the rashness of a measure to be taken without concert or preparation. I seemed to be in a state in which reason had no power. I felt as if I could coolly survey the several arguments of the case, perceive that they had pru∣dence, truth and common sense on their side: and then answer, I am under the guidance of a direc∣tor more energetic than you.</P>
<P>I was not long in executing what I had thus ra∣pidly determined. I fixed on the evening of that very day as the period of my evasion. Even in this short interval I had perhaps sufficient time for de∣liberation. But all opportunity was useless to me; my mind was fixed, and each succeeding moment only increased the unspeakable eagerness with which I meditated my escape. The hours usually observed by our family in this country residence were regular; and one in the morning was the time I selected for my undertaking. I stole down quietly from my chamber with a lamp in my hand;
<PB N="217" REF="028752_0219_0FDBF192D122FA68"/>
I went along a passage that led to a small door opening into the garden, and then crossed the gar∣den to a gate that intersected an elm walk and a private horse-path on the outside.</P>
<P>I could scarcely believe my good-fortune in hav∣ing thus far executed my design without interrup∣tion. The terrible images Mr. Falkland's menaces had suggested to my mind, made me expect impe∣diment and detection at every step, though the im∣passioned state of my mind impelled me to advance with desperate resolution. I drew a favourable omen as to the final result of my project, from the desirable event which had attended me in the outset.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXI.</HEAD>
<P>THE first plan that had suggested itself to me was, to go to the nearest public road, and take the earliest stage for London. There I believed I should be most safe from discovery, if the venge∣ance of Mr. Falkland should prompt him to pursue me; and I did not doubt, among the multiplied resources of the metropolis, to find something which should suggest to me an eligible mode of disposing of my person and industry. I reserved Mr. Fores∣ter in my arrangement as a last resource, not to be called forth unless for immediate protection from the hand of persecution and power.</P>
<P>The mode of my proceeding being thus far di∣gested, I traced with a chearful heart the unfre∣quented path it was now necessary for me to pur∣sue. The night was gloomy, and it drizzled with rain. But these were circumstances I had scarcely the power to perceive; all was sunshine and joy within me. I hardly felt the ground; I repeated to myself a thousand times, I am free. What con∣cern have I with danger and alarm; I feel that I am free; I feel that I will continue so. What power is able to hold in chains a mind ardent and deter∣mined? What power can cause that man to die, whose whole soul commands him to continue to live? I looked back with abhorrence to the sub∣jection in which I had been held. I did not hate the author of my misfortunes; truth and justice acquit me of that; I rather pitied the hard destiny
<PB N="219" REF="028752_0221_0FDBF199C83E65B8"/>
to which he seemed condemned. But I thought with unspeakable loathing of those errors, in con∣sequence of which every man is fated to be more or less the tyrant or the slave. I was astonished at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olly of my species, that they did not rise up as one man, and shake off chains so ignominious and misery so insupportable. So far as related to my∣self, I resolved, and this resolution has never been entirely forgotten by me, to hold myself disengaged from the odious scene, and never fill the part either of the oppressor or the sufferer.</P>
<P>My mind continued in this enthusiastical state, full of confidence, and accessible only to such a portion of sear as served rather to keep up a state of pleasurable emotion, than to generate anguish and distress, during the whole of this nocturnal expedition. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter a walk of three hours I arrived without accident at the village from which I hoped to have taken my passage for the metropolis. At this early hour every thing was quiet; no found of any thing human saluted my ear. It was with difficulty that I gained admittance into the yard of the inn, where I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound a single ostler taking care of some horses. From him I received the unwelcome tidings that the coach was not expected till six o'clock in the morning of the following day, its route through that town recurring only three times a-week.</P>
<P>This intelligence gave the first check to the rap∣turous inebriation by which my mind had been pos∣sessed from the moment I quitted the habitation of Mr. Falkland. The whole of my fortune in ready cash consisted of about eleven guineas. I had about fifty more that had fallen to me from the disposal of my property at the death of my father; but that was so vested as to preclude it from immediate use, and I even doubted whether it would not be found
<PB N="220" REF="028752_0222_0FDBF16514421C88"/>
better ultimately to resign it, than by claiming it to risk the furnishing a clue to what I most of all dreaded to incur, the persecution of Mr. Falkland. There was nothing I so ardently desired as the an∣nihilation of all future intercourse between us, that he should not know there was such a person on the earth as myself, and that I should never more hear the name of my quondam master.</P>
<P>Thus circumstanced, I conceived frugality to be an object by no means unworthy of my attention, unable as I was to prognosticate what discourage∣ments and delays might present themselves to the accomplishment of my wishes, after my arrival in London. For this and other reasons I determined to adhere to my design of travelling by the stage; it only remaining for me to consider in what manner I should prevent the eventual delay of twenty-four hours from becoming by any untoward event a source of new calamity. It was by no means ad∣visable to remain at the village where I now was, during this interval; nor did I even think it proper to employ it in proceeding on foot along the great road. I therefore decided upon making a circuit, the direction of which should seem at first extremely wide of my intended route, and then suddenly striking into a different path should enable me to arrive by the close of day at a market-town twelve miles nearer to the metropolis.</P>
<P>Having fixed the economy of the day, and per∣suaded myself that it was the best which under the circumstances could be adopted, I dismissed for the most part all farther anxieties from my mind, and eagerly yielded myself up to the different amuse∣ments that arose. I rested and went forward at the impulse of the moment. At one time I reclined upon a bank immersed in contemplation, and at another exerted myself to analyse the prospects
<PB N="221" REF="028752_0223_0FDBF19B109193C0"/>
which succeeded each other. The haziness of the morning was followed by a spirit-stirring and beautiful day. With the ductility so characteristic of a youthful mind, I forgot the anguish which had lately been my continual guest, and occu∣pied myself entirely in dreams of future no∣velty and felicity. I scarcely ever in the whole course of my existence spent a day of more various or exquisite gratification. It furnished a strong and perhaps not an unsalutary contrast to the ter∣rors which had preceded, and the dreadful scenes that awaited me.</P>
<P>In the evening I arrived at the place of my des∣tination, enquired for the inn at which the coach was accustomed to call, and ordered myself refresh∣ment and a bed. I had not been long here, before, having occasion to cross the inn yard upon some oc∣casion, just as I was going again to enter the house I saw one of Mr. Falkland's footmen riding into the gate-way. I had no doubt that I was myself the object of his journey. But it was too late to think of avoiding his observation; he was almost upon me before I saw him. Every incident con∣nected with my late abhorred situation was calcu∣lated to impress me with the deepest alarm. My first thought was to betake myself to the fields, and trust to the swiftness of my flight for safety. But I presently remarked that he was alone; and I be∣lieved that it would be disgraceful to fly, when, man to man, I might reasonably hope I could at any time get the better, either by the firmness of my deter∣mination, or the subtlety of my invention.</P>
<P>Thus determined, I came up to him as he alight∣ed from his horse and bade him follow into the room where I had been sitting. Well, Thomas, said I, I guess your errand; but it is to no purpose. You come to conduct me back to Falkland House; but no force shall ever drag me to that place alive. I
<PB N="222" REF="028752_0224_0FDBF16B9AFDCA40"/>
have not taken my resolution without great consi∣deration and strong reasons; and, having taken it, all the world shall never persuade me to alter. I am an Englishman; and it is the privilege of an Englishman to be sole judge and master of his own actions.</P>
<P>Why, master Williams, replied Thomas, to be sure you should know best what you are about. We are all at a stound, as a man may say, to think what you have got in your head. But that is none of my business. Sure enough the squire expects you to go back with me; but I have a letter for you, and mayhap when you have read that, you may come off from a little of your stoutness. For my part I knew poor farmer Williams, your father, these many a day, and I should be main <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth for his fake and your own too, that you should come to any sorrow.</P>
<P>Thus saying, he gave me his letter, which was from Mr. Forester, whom, as he told me, he had left at my master's house. It was as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>WILLIAMS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>My brother Falkland has sent his man Thomas in pursuit of you. He expects that, if found, you will return with him. I expect so too. It is of the utmost consequence to your future honour and character. After reading these lines, if you are a villain and a rascal, you will perhaps endea∣vour to fly. If your conscience tells you, You are innocent, you will out of all doubt come back. Let me know whether I have been your dupe; and whether, while I was won over by your seeming ingenuity, I was the tool of a designing knave. If you come, I pledge myself that, if you clear your reputation, you shall not only be free to go wherever you please, but shall receive every assist∣ance
<PB N="223" REF="028752_0225_0FDBF19EEA628278"/>
it is in my power to give. Remember! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> en∣gage for nothing farther than that.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>VALENTINE FORESTER.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>What a letter was this? To a mind like mine glowing with the love of virtue, such an address was strong enough to draw the person to whom it was addressed from one end of the earth to the other. Prisons, racks and gibbets would have shrunk into nothing in comparison with it. The ideas it suggested had a tendency to fill the mind, and shut out the possibility of competition.</P>
<P>I repassed in my thoughts every memorable in∣cident that had happened to me under the roof of Mr. Falkland. I could recollect nothing, except the affair of the mysterious chest, out of which the shadow of an accusation of the nature alluded to in Mr. Forester's letter could be extorted. In that instance no doubt my conduct had been highly reprehensible, and I had never looked back upon it without remorse and self-condemnation. But I did not believe that it was of the nature of those actions which can be brought under legal censure. I still less could persuade myself to believe, that Mr. Falkland, who shuddered at the very possibility of his own detection, and who considered himself as completely in my power, would dare to bring forward a subject so closely connected with that topic, which wakened eternal agony in his soul. In a word, the more I reflected on the phrases of Mr. Forester's billet, the less could I imagine the nature of those scenes to which they were to serve as a prelude.</P>
<P>The inscrutableness however of the mystery they contained was by no means calculated to mitigate my apprehensions. It served on the contrary to give new pungency to my alarm. It overwhelmed
<PB N="224" REF="028752_0226_0FDBF16F25E27C80"/>
every quality of my mind; except my fortitude. What resources had not my persecutor at his com∣mand? It was now that I began to fear him. All the apprehensions that had before haunted my mind seemed, in comparison with what I now felt, like the gambols of children. But what could I do? This was an enemy to face and not to fly. Tear me to pieces, exclaimed I, tremendous and incomprehensible genius! hang up this miserable car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ass to writhe beneath a burning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>un! inflict upon me unheard of and lingering tortures!—that in some part or other of the earth you might do! But my good name shall never be your victim! I will be heard; I will be understood! All the arts of hell shall not prevent that! I may be unfortu∣nate; but my very persecutors shall confess my in∣nocence!</P>
<P>Thomas, said I, after a considerable interval spent in silence, to my attendant, You are right. This is indeed a very extraordinary letter you have brought me; but it answers its purpose. I will certainly go with you now, whatever be the con∣sequence. No person shall ever be able to lay any blame to me, so long as I have it in my power to clear myself. So, get ready immediately!</P>
<P>Bless us, cried Thomas, this is a surprising change indeed! But I should think, sir, if you please, that there is no need of being in such a devil of a hurry. It is now dark night, and I am woundy tired. Whatever it is you may have got in your head, I dare to say neither you nor master will do any thing till to-morrow.</P>
<P>To this remonstrance I replied, that I would willingly consent to a respite of an hour or two hours, if he desired it, but longer than that I was determined I would not wait, and, if he were not then ready, I would proceed without him. I con∣ceived that, in the circumstances in which I was
<PB N="225" REF="028752_0227_0FDBF1A05077C260"/>
placed by Mr. Forester's letter, it became me to show, not merely a willingness, but an alacrity and impatience to return. Thomas confessed that it was in his orders not to part from me when I was once found, and of consequence he was obliged to agree to the compromise I proposed. We pro∣cured a second horse from the village. As we rode home, my mind was occupied again and again in endeavouring to account for Mr. Forester's letter; but none of my attempts were productive of satis∣faction. I knew the inflexibility and sternness of Mr. Falkland's mind in accomplishing the purposes he had most at heart; but I also knew that every virtuous and magnanimous principle was congenial to his character.</P>
<P>When we arrived it was still dark, though the greater part of the night had already elapsed. We were obliged to waken one of the servants to give us admittance. I found that Mr. Forester had left a message for me in consideration of the possibility of my arrival during the night, directing me im∣mediately to go to bed, and to take care that I did not come weary and exhausted to the business of the following day. I endeavoured to take his advice; but my slumbers were unrefreshing and disturbed. This did not discourage me; the singularity of my situation, my conjectures with respect to the pre∣sent, my apprehensions for the future did not allow me to think it possible that I could sink into a lan∣guid and inactive state.</P>
<P>Next morning the first person I saw was Mr. Forester. He told me that he did not yet know what Mr. Falkland had to allege against me, for that he had refused to know. He had arrived at the house of his brother by appointment on the preceding day to settle some indispensable business, his intention having been to depart the moment the business was finished, as he knew that conduct on
<PB N="226" REF="028752_0228_0FDBF17112932C38"/>
his part would be most agreeable to Mr. Falkland. But he was no sooner come than he found the whole house in confusion, the alarm of my elope∣ment having been given a little before. Mr. Falk∣land had dispatched servants in all directions in pursuit of me; and the servant from the market town arrived at the same moment with Mr. Fo∣rester, with intelligence that a person answering to the description h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> gave had been there very ear∣ly in the morning enquiring respecting the stage to London.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland seemed extremely disturbed at this information, and exclaimed upon me with great acrimony as an unthankful and unnatural villain.</P>
<P>Mr. Forester replied: Have more command of yourself, sir! Villain is a very serious appellation, and ought not to be trifled with. Englishmen are free; and no man ought to be charged with villai∣ny because he chooses to change one source of sub∣sistence for another.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland shook his head, and with a smile expressive of acute sensibility said, Brother, bro∣ther, you are the dupe of his art. For my part I always considered him with an eye of suspicion, and was aware of his depravity. But I have just discovered—</P>
<P>Stop, sir! interrupted Mr. Forester. I own I thought you might be employing in a moment of acrimony harsh epithets without any accurate mean∣ing. But, if you have any serious accusation to make against Williams, let us not be told of that, till it be known whether the poor lad is within reach of a hearing. Though a just man will chear∣fully suffer the ill opinion of others, he will not lightly entertain an ill opinion against them. For my part the slenderest allowance I can make to such as are unhappy enough to incur the detesta∣tion of their species, is that of being previously
<PB N="227" REF="028752_0229_0FDBF1A54B201948"/>
heard in their own defence. It is a wise principle in English law that requires the judge to come into court totally uninformed of the merits of the cause he is to try; and to that principle I am determin∣ed to conform as an individual. I think it right to be severe and inflexible in proceeding against offen∣ders, but the severity I exercise in the sequel shall always be accompanied with impartiality in the preliminary.</P>
<P>While Mr. Forester related to me th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se parti∣culars, he observed me ready to break out into some of the expressions which the narrative sug∣gested, but he would not suffer me to speak. No, Williams, said he; I would not hear Mr. Falkland against you; neither will I hear you in your de∣fence. I am come to you at present to speak, and not to hear. I thought it became me to warn you of your danger, but I have nothing more to do now. Reserve what you have to say to the proper time. Make the best story you can for yourself; true, if truth, as I hope, will serve your purpose; but, if not, the most plausible and ingenious you can invent. That is an exertion which self-defence requires from every man in cases where, as it al∣ways happens when a man is put upon his trial, he has the whole world against him, and has his own battle to fight against the world. Farewel, and God send you a good deliverance! If Mr. Falkland's accusation, whatever it be, shall appear to be premature, depend upon having me more zealously your friend than ever. If not, this is the last act of friendship you will ever receive from me!</P>
<P>It may be believed that this address, so singular, so solemn, so big with conditional menace, did not greatly tend to assuage my anxieties. I was totally ignorant of the charge to be advanced against me; and not a little astonished, when it was in my
<PB N="228" REF="028752_0230_0FDBF175B7804080"/>
power to be in the most formidable degree the ac∣cuser of Mr. Falkland, to find the principles of equity so completely reversed, as for the innocent, but instructed individual, to be the party accused and suffering, instead of having, as was just, the real criminal at his mercy. I was still more asto∣nished at the supernatural power Mr. Falkland seemed to possess of bringing back by the most irresistible means the object of his persecution within the sphere of his authority; a reflection attended with some discouragement to that thirst of independence which now constituted the ruling passion of my mind.</P>
<P>But this was no time for meditation. To the sufferer the course of events is taken out of his di∣rection, and he is hurried along with an irresisti∣ble force, without finding it within the compass of his efforts to check their rapidity. I was allowed only a very short time to recollect myself, when my trial commenced. I was conducted to the li∣brary where I had passed so many happy and so many contemplative hours, and found there Mr. Forester and three of four of the servants already assembled in expectation of me and my accuser. Every thing was calculated to suggest to me that I must trust only in the justice of the parties con∣cerned, and had nothing to hope from their mercy. Mr. Falkland entered at one door, almost as soon as I entered at the other.</P>

<HEAD>THE ADVENTURES OF CALEB WILLIAMS.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>HE began: It has been the principle of my life never to inflict a wilful injury upon any thing that lives; I need not express my regret when I find myself obliged to be the promulgator of a criminal charge. How gladly would I pass unnoticed the evil I have sustained! but I owe it to society to de∣tect an offender, and prevent other men from be∣ing imposed upon, as I have been, by an appear∣ance of integrity.</P>
<P>It would be better, interrupted Mr. Forester, to speak directly to the point. We ought not,
<PB N="6" REF="028752_0234_0FDBF1A6544BC530"/>
though unwarily, by apologising for ourselves, to create at such a time a prejudice against an indi∣vidual, against whom a criminal accusation will always be prejudice enough.</P>
<P>I strongly suspect, continued Mr. Falkland, this young man, who has been peculiarly the object of my kindness, of having robbed me to a consider∣able amount.</P>
<P>What, replied Mr. Forester, are the grounds of your suspicion?</P>
<P>The first of them is the actual loss! have sus∣tained in notes, jewels and plate. I have missed bank notes to the amount of nine hundred pounds, three gold repeaters of extraordinary value, a com∣plete suit of diamonds the property of my late mo∣ther, and several other articles.</P>
<P>And why, continued my arbitrator, astonish∣ment, grief, and a desire to retain his self-pos∣session strongly contending in his countenance and voice, do you fix on this young man as the instru∣ment of the depredation?</P>
<P>I found him, on my coming home upon the day when every thing was in disorder from the alarm of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire, in the very act of quitting the private apart∣ment where these things were deposited. He was confounded at seeing me, and hastened to withdraw as soon as he possibly could.</P>
<P>Did you say nothing to him, take no notice of the confusion your sudden appearance produced?</P>
<P>I asked what was his errand in that place. He was at first so terrified and overcome that he could not answer me. Afterwards with a good deal of faltering he said that, when all the servants were engaged in endeavouring to save the most valuable part of my property, he had come hither with the same view; but that he had as yet removed no∣thing.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="028752_0235_0FDBF1A7D1BF4DF0"/>
Did you immediately examine to see that every thing was safe?</P>
<P>No. I was accustomed to confide in his honesty, and I was suddenly called away in the present in∣stance to attend to the increasing progress of the flames. I therefore only took out the key from the door of the apartment, having first locked it, and, putting it in my pocket, hastened to go where my presence seemed indispensably necessary.</P>
<P>How long was it before you missed your pro∣perty?</P>
<P>The same evening. The hurry of the scene had driven the circumstance entirely out of my mind, till, going by accident near the apartment, the whole affair, together with the singular and equi∣vocal behaviour of Williams, rushed at once upon my recollection. I immediately entered, examined the chest in which these things were contained, and to my astonishment found the locks broken and the property gone.</P>
<P>What steps did you take upon this discovery?</P>
<P>I sent for Williams, and talked to him very se∣riously upon the subject. But he had now per∣fectly recovered his self-command, and calmly and stoutly denied all knowledge of the matter. I urged him with the enormousness of the offence, but it made no impression. He did not discover either the surprise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> indignation one would have expected from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> entirely innocent, or the uneasiness that gener<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y attends upon guilt. He was rather silent and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. I then informed him, that I should proce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in a manner different from what he might perhaps expect. I would not, as is too frequent in such cases▪ make a general re∣search, for I had rather lose my property for ever without redress, than expose a multitude of inno∣cent persons to anxiety and injustice. My suspicion
<PB N="8" REF="028752_0236_0FDBF1F396AF7308"/>
for the present <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/>dably fixed upon him. But in a matter of so great consequence I was deter∣mined not to act upon suspicion. I would neither incur the possibility of raining him being inno∣cent, nor be the instrument of exposing others to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> depredations, if guilty. I should therefore merely insist upon his continuing in my service. He might depend upon it he should be well watch∣ed, and I trusted the whole truth would eventually appear. Since he avoided confession now, I ad∣vised him to con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ider how far it was likely he would come off with impunity at last. This I was de∣termined on, that the moment he attempted an escape, I would confider that as an indication of guilt and proceed accordingly.</P>
<P>What circumstances have occurred from that time to the present?</P>
<P>None upon which I can infer ▪ certainty of guilt. Several that agree to favour a suspicion. From that time Williams was perpetually uneasy in his situation, always desirous, as it now appears, to escape, but afraid to adopt such a measure with∣out certain precautions. It was not long after, that you, Mr. Forester, became my visitor. I ob∣served with dissatisfaction the growing intercourse between you, reflecting on the equivocalness of his character, and the attempt he would probably make to render you the dup<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of his hypocrisy. I accordingly threatened him severely, and I believe you observed the change that presently after took place in his behaviour with relation to you.</P>
<P>I did, and it appeared at that time mysterious and extraordinary.</P>
<P>Some time after, as you well know, a rencounter took place between you, whether accidental or in∣tentional on his part I am not able to say, when he confessed to you the uneasiness of his mind without
<PB N="9" REF="028752_0237_0FDBF1ACA41AF350"/>
discovering the cause, and openly proposed to you to assist him in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>light, and stand in case of ne∣cessity between him and my resentment. You offered, it seems, to take him into your service, but nothing, as he acknowledged, would answer his purpose, that did not place his retreat wholly out of my power to discover.</P>
<P>Did it not appear extraordinary to you that he should hope for any effectual protection from me, while it remained perpetually in your power to sa∣tisfy me of his unworthiness?</P>
<P>Perhaps he had hopes that I should not proceed to that step, at least so long as the place of his re∣treat should be unknown to me, and of conse∣quence the event of my proceeding dubious. Per∣haps he confided in his own powers, which are far from contemptible, to construct a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> plausible tale, especially as he had taken care to have the first im∣pression in his favour. After all, this protection on your part was merely reserved in case all other expedients failed. He does not appear to have had any other sentiment upon the subject, than that, if he were defeated in his projects for placing him∣self beyond the reach of justice, it was better to have bespoken himself a place in your patronage than to be destitute of every resource.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland having thus finished his evidence, called upon Robert, the valet, to confirm that part of it which related to the day of the fire.</P>
<P>Robert stated, that he happened to be coming through the library that day, a few minutes after Mr. Falkland's being brought home by the sight of the fire, that he had found me standing there with every mark of perturbation and fright, that he was so struck with my appearance that he could not help stopping to notice it, that he had spoken to me two or three times before he could obtain an answer,
<PB N="10" REF="028752_0238_0FDBF1F90876A040"/>
and that all he could get from me at last, was that I was the most miserable creature alive.</P>
<P>He farther said, that in the evening of the same day Mr. Falkland called him into the private apart∣ment adjoining to the library, and bid him bring him a hammer and some nails. He then showed him a chest standing in the apartment with its locks and fastenings broken, and ordered him to observe and remember what he saw, but not to mention it to any one. Robert did not at that time know what Mr. Falkland intended by these directions; but he entertained no doubt that the fastenings were broken and wrenched by the app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ication of a chissel or such like instrument with the intention of forcibly open∣ing the chest.</P>
<P>Mr. Forester observed upon this evidence, that as much of it as related to the day of the fire seem∣ed indeed to afford powerful reasons for suspicion, and that the circumstances that had occurred since strang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oncurred to fortify that suspicion. Mean∣time, that nothing proper to be done might be omitted, he proposed searching my boxes to see whether by that means any trace could be discover∣ed to confirm the imputation. Mr. Falkland treat∣ed this suggestion slightly, saying that, if I were the thief, I had no doubt taken the precaution to obviate so palpable a means of detection. To this Mr. Forester only replied, that conjecture, how∣ever skilfully formed, was not always realised in the actions and behaviour of mankind; and ordered that my boxes and trunks should be brought into the library. The two that were first opened contained nothing to confirm the accusation against me; in the third were found a watch and several jewels that were immediately known to be the property of Mr. Falkland. The production of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>mingly decisive evidence excited emotions of astonishment
<PB N="11" REF="028752_0239_0FDBF1AE0580CC58"/>
and concern: but no person's astonishment appear∣ed to be greater than that of Mr. Falkland.</P>
<P>To the rest of the persons present I seemed to be merely the subject of detection; but in reality I was of all the spectators that individual who was most at a loss to conceive through every stage of the scene what would come next, and who listened to every word that was uttered with the most un∣controulable amazement. Amazement however al∣ternately yielded the ascendancy to indignation and horror. At first I could not refrain from repeated∣ly attempting to interrupt; but I was checked in these attempts by Mr. Forester, and I presently felt how necessary it was to my future peace that I should collect the whole energy of my mind to re∣pel the charge, and assert my innocence.</P>
<P>Every thing being now produced that could be produced against me, Mr. Forester turned to me with a look of concern and pity, and told me that now was the time if I chose to allege any thing in my defence. In reply to this invitation I spoke nearly as follows:</P>
<P>I am innocent. It is in vain that circumstances are accumulated against me: there is not a person upon earth less capable than I of the things of which I am accused. I appeal to my heart; I ap∣peal to my looks; I appeal to every sentiment my tongue ever uttered.</P>
<P>I could perceive that the fervour with which I spoke made some impression upon every one that heard me. But in a moment their eyes were turn∣ed upon the property that lay before them, and their countenances changed. I proceeded:</P>
<P>One thing more I must aver; Mr. Falkland is not deceived: he perfectly knows that I am inno∣cent.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="028752_0240_0FDBF1B487D0D2F0"/>
I had no sooner uttered these words than an in∣voluntary cry of indignation burst from every per∣son in the room. Mr. Forester turned to me with a look of extreme severity, and said:</P>
<P>Young man, consider well what you are doing! It is the privilege of the party accused to say what∣ever he thinks proper; and I will take care that you shall enjoy that privilege in its utmost extent. But do you think it will conduce in any respect to your benefit to throw out such insolent and intolerable insinuations?</P>
<P>I thank you most sincerely, replied I, for your caution; but I well know what it is that I am do∣ing. I make this averment nor merely because it is solemnly true, but because it is inseparably con∣nected with my vindication. I am the party ac∣cused, and I shall be told that I am not to be be∣lieved in my own defence. I can produce no other witnesses of my innocence; I therefore call upon Mr. Falkland to be my evidence. I ask him,</P>
<P>Did you never boast to me in private of your power to ruin me? Did you never say that, if once I brought on myself the weight of your dis∣pleasure, my fall should be irreparable? Did you not tell me that, though I should prepare in that case a tale ever so plausible or ever so true, you would take care that the whole world should exe∣crate me as an impostor? Were not those your very words? Did you not add that my innocence should be of no service to me, and that you laughed at so feeble a defence? I ask you farther, Did you not receive a letter from me the morning of the day on which I departed, requesting your consent to my departure? Should I have done that, if my flight had been that of a thief? I challenge any man to reconcile the expressions of that letter with this accusation. Should I have begun with stating that
<PB N="13" REF="028752_0241_0FDBF1B550E20580"/>
I had conceived a desire to quit your service, if my desire and the reasons for it had been of the nature that is now alledged? Should I have dared to ask for what reason I was thus subjected to an eternal penance?</P>
<P>Saying this, I took out a copy of my letter and laid it open upon the table.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland returned no immediate answer to my interrogations. Mr. Forester turned to him, and said, Well, sir, what is your reply to this chal∣lenge of your servant?</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland answered: Such a mode of defence hardly stands in need of a reply. But I answer, I held no such conversation; I never used such words; I received no such letter. Surely it is no sufficient rebutter of a criminal charge, that the criminal repels what is alledged against him with volubility of speech and intrepidity of manner?</P>
<P>Mr. Forester then turned to me. If, said he, you trust your vindication to the plausibility of your tale, you must take care to render it consistent and complete. You have not told us what was the cause of the confusion and anxiety in which Robert pro∣fesses to have found you, why you were so impa∣tient to quit the service of Mr. Falkland, or how you account for certain articles of his property being found in your possession?</P>
<P>All that, sir, answered I, is true. There are certain parts of my story that I have not told. If they were told, they would not contribute to my disadvantage, and they would make the present ac∣cusation appear still more astonishing. But I can∣not, as yet at least, prevail upon myself to tell them. Is it necessary to give any particular and precise reasons why I should wish to change the place of my residence? You all of you know the unfortu∣nate state of Mr. Falkland's mind. You know the
<PB N="14" REF="028752_0242_0FDBF1FA55A8C4F0"/>
sternness, reservedness and distance of his manners. If I had no other reasons, surely it would afford small presumption of criminality that I should wish to change his service for another.</P>
<P>The question of how these articles of Mr. Falk∣land's property came to be found in my possession is more material. It is a question I am wholly unable to answer. Their being found there was at least as unexpected to me as to any one of the persons now present. I only know that, as I have the most perfect assurance of Mr. Falkland's being conscious of my innocence, for, observe! I do not shrink from that assertion, I reiterate it with new confidence; I therefore firmly and from my soul believe that their being there is of Mr. Falkland's contrivance.</P>
<P>I had no sooner said this, than I was again in∣terrupted by an involuntary exclamation from every one present. They looked at me with furi∣ous glances, as if they could have torn me to pieces, I proceeded:</P>
<P>I have now answered every thing that is alleged against me.</P>
<P>Mr. Forester, you are a lover of justice; I con∣jure you not to violate it in my person. You are a man of penetration; look at me, do you see any of the marks of guilt? Recollect all that has ever passed under your observation; is it compatible with a mind capable of what is now alleged against me? Could a real criminal have shown himself so unabashed, composed and firm as I have now done?</P>
<P>Fellow servants! Mr. Falkland is a man of rank and fortune; he is your master. I am a poor country lad without a friend in the world. That is a ground of real difference to a certain extent; but it is not a sufficient ground for the subversion
<PB N="15" REF="028752_0243_0FDBF1BB496AC440"/>
of justice. Remember, that I am in a situation that is not to be trifled with, that a decision given against me now, in a case in which I solemnly assure you I am innocent, will for ever deprive me of reputation and peace of mind, combine the whole world in a league against me, and determine perhaps upon my liberty and my life. If you believe, if you see, if you know that I am inno∣cent, speak for me. Do not suffer a pusillanimous timidity to prevent you from saving a fellow crea∣ture from destruction, who does not deserve to have a human being for his enemy. Why have we the power of speech, but to communicate our thoughts? I will never believe that a man con∣scious of innocence, cannot make other men per∣ceive that he has that thought. Do not you feel that my whole heart tells me, I am not guilty of what is imputed to me?</P>
<P>To you, Mr. Falkland, I have nothing to say. I know you, and know that you are impenetrable. At the very moment that you are urging such odious charges against me, you admire my reso∣lution and forbearance. But I have nothing to hope from you. You can look upon my ruin without pity or remorse. I am most unfortunate indeed in having to do with such an adversary. You oblige me to say ill things of you; but I ap∣peal to your own heart whether it is not in my power to say infinitely worse.</P>
<P>Every thing that could be alleged on either side being now concluded, Mr. Forester undertook to make some remarks upon the whole. Williams, said he, the charge against you is heavy; the di∣rect evidence is strong; the corroborating circum∣stances are numerous and striking. I grant that you have shown considerable dexterity in your an∣swers; but you will learn, young man, to your
<PB N="16" REF="028752_0244_0FDBF200DEFD5D68"/>
cost, that dexterity, however powerful it may be in certain cases, will avail little against the stub∣bornness of truth. It is fortunate for mankind that the empire of talents has its limitations, and that it is not in the power of ingenuity to subvert the distinctions of right and wrong. Take my word for it, that the true merits of the case against you will be too strong for sophistry to overturn, that justice will prevail, and impotent malice be defeated.</P>
<P>To you, Mr. Falkland, society is obliged for hav∣ing placed this black affair in its true light. Do not suffer the malignant aspersions of the criminal to give you any uneasiness. Depend upon it that they will be found of no weight. I have no doubt that your character in the judgment of every per∣son that has heard them stands higher than ever. We feel for your misfortune in being obliged to hear such calumnies from a person who has in∣jured you so grossly. But you must be considered in that respect as a martyr in the public cause. The purity of your motives and dispositions are beyond the reach of malice; and truth and equity will not fail to award to your calumniator in∣famy, and to you the love and approbation of mankind.</P>
<P>I have now told you, Williams, what I think of your case. But I have no right to assume to be your ultimate▪ judge. Desperate as it appears to me, I will give you one piece of advice as if I were retained as a counsel to assist you. Leave out of it whatever tells to the disadvantage of Mr. Falkland. Defend yourself as well as you can, but do not attack your master. It is your busi∣ness to create in those that hear you a prepossession in your favour. But the recrimination you have been now practising will always create indigna∣tion.
<PB N="17" REF="028752_0245_0FDBF1BC111E0CB0"/>
Dishonesty will admit of some palliation. The deliberate malice you have now been showing is a thousand times more atrocious. It proves you to have the mind of a demon rather than a felon. Wherever you shall repeat it, those who hear you will pronounce you guilty upon that, even if the proper evidence against you were glaringly defec∣tive. If therefore you would consult your interest, which seems to be your only consideration, it is incumbent upon you by all means immediately to retract that. If you desire to be believed honest, you must in the first place show that you have a due sense of merit in others. You cannot better serve your cause than by begging pardon of your master, and doing homage to rectitude and worth even when they are employed in vengeance against you.</P>
<P>It is easy to conceive that my mind sustained an extreme shock from the decision of Mr. Forester; but his call upon me to retract and humble myself before my accuser penetrated my whole soul with indignation. I answered:</P>
<P>I have already told you I am innocent. I believe that I could not endure the effort of inventing a plausible defence, if it were otherwise. You have just affirmed that it is not in the power of inge∣nuity to subvert the distinctions of right and wrong, and in that very moment I find them sub∣verted. This is indeed to me a very awful mo∣ment. New to the world, I know nothing of its affairs but what has reached me by rumour, or is recorded in books. I have come into it with all the ardour and confidence inseparable from my years. In every fellow-being I expected to find a friend. I am unpractised in its wiles, and have even no acquaintance with its injustice. I have done nothing to deserve the animosity of mankind,
<PB N="18" REF="028752_0246_0FDBF201DBF24C00"/>
but, if I may judge from the present scene, I am from henceforth to be deprived of the benefits of integrity and honour. I am to forfeit the friend∣ship of every one I have hitherto known, and to be precluded from the power of acquiring that of others. I must therefore be reduced to derive my satisfaction from myself. Depend upon it I will not begin that career by dishonourable concessions. If I am to despair of the good will of other men, I will at least maintain the independence of my own mind. Mr. Falkland is my implacable ene∣my. Whatever may be his merits in other re∣spects, he is acting towards me without huma∣nity, without remorse and without principle. Do you think I will ever make any submissions to a man by whom I am thus treated, that I will fall down at the feet of one who is to me a devil, or kiss the hand that is red with my blood?</P>
<P>In that respect, answered Mr. Forester, do as you shall think proper. I must confess that your firmness and consistency astonish me. They add something to what I had conceived of human pow∣ers. Perhaps you have chosen the part which all things considered may serve your purpose best, though I think more moderation would be more conciliating. The exterior of innocence will, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ant, stagger the persons who may have the di∣rection of your fate, but it will never be able to prevail against plain and incontrovertible facts. But I have done with you. I see in you a new in∣stance of that abuse which is so generally made of talents the admiration of an undiscerning public. I regard you with horror. And all that remains is that I should discharge my duty in consigning you as a monster of depravity to the justice of your country.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="028752_0247_0FDBF1C0DD4BD120"/>
No, rejoined Mr. Falkland, to that I can never consent. I have put a restraint upon myself thus far, because it was right that evidence and en∣quiry should take their course. I have suppressed all my habits and sentiments, because it seemed due to the public that hypocrisy should be un∣masked. But I can suffer this violence no longer. I have through my whole life interfered to protect, not overbear the sufferer; and I must do so now. I feel not the smallest resentment of his impotent attacks upon my character; I smile at their malice; and they make no diminution in my benevolence to their author. Let him say what he pleases; he cannot hurt me. It was proper that he should be brought to public shame, that other people might not be deceived by him as we have been. But there is no necessity for proceed∣ing any farther; and I must insist upon it that he be permitted to depart wherever he pleases. I am sorry that public interest affords so gloomy a pros∣pect for his future happiness.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland, answered Mr. Forester, these sen∣timents do honour to your humanity; but I must not give way to them. They only serve to set in a stronger light the venom of this serpent, this monster of ingratitude, who first robs his bene∣factor, and then reviles him. Wretch that you are, will nothing move you? Are you inaccessi∣ble to remorse? Are you not struck to the heart with the unmerited goodness of your master? Vile calumniator! you are the abhorrence of nature, the opprobrium of the human species, and the earth can only be freed from an insupportable bur∣then by your being exterminated! Recollect, sir, that this villain, at the very moment that you are exercising such unexampled forbearance in his be∣half, has the presumption to charge you with pro∣secuting
<PB N="20" REF="028752_0248_0FDBF203ACBE6050"/>
a crime of which you know him to be innocent, nay, with having conveyed the pretend∣ed stolen goods among his property for the express purpose of ruining him. By this unexampled vil∣lainy he makes it your duty to free the world from such a pest, and your interest to admit no relaxing in your pursuit of him, lest the world should be persuaded by your clemency to credit his vile in∣sinuations.</P>
<P>I care no for consequences, replied Mr. Falk∣land, I will obey the dictates of my own mind. I will never lend my personal assistance to the reform∣ing mankind by axes and gibbets; I am sure things will never go well, till honour and not law be the dictator of mankind, till vice is taught to shrink before the resistless might of inborn dignity, and not before the cold formality of statutes. If my calumniator were worthy of my resentment I would chastise him with my own sword, and not that of the magistrate; but in the present case I smile at his malice, and resolve to spare him, as the gene∣rous lord of the forest spares the insect that would disturb his repose.</P>
<P>The language you now hold, said Mr. Forester, is that of romance, and not of reason. Yet I can∣not but be struck with the contrast exhibited be∣fore me of the magnanimity of virtue and the ob∣stinate, impenetrable injustice of guilt. While your mind overflows with goodness, nothing can touch the heart of this thrice-bred villain. I shall never forgive myself for having once been entrap∣ped by his detestable arts. This is no time for us to settle the question between chivalry and law. I shall therefore simply insist as a magistrate, having taken the evidence in this felony, upon my right and duty of following the course of justice, and committing the accused to the county jail.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="028752_0249_0FDBF1C2134453C8"/>
After some farther contest Mr. Falkland, find∣ing Mr. Forester obstinate and impracticable, with∣drew his opposition. Accordingly a proper officer was summoned from the neighbouring village, a mittimus made out, and one of Mr. Falkland's carriages prepared to conduct me to the place of custody. It will easily be imagined that this sudden reverse was very painfully felt by me. I looked round on the servants who had been the spectators of my examinations, but not one of them either by word or gesture expressed any compassion for my calami∣ty. The robbery of which I was accused appeared to them atrocious from its magnitude, and what∣ever sparks of compassion might otherwise have sprung up in their ingenuous and undisciplined minds, were totally obliterated by indignation at my supposed profligacy in recriminating upon their worthy and excellent master. My fate being already determined, and one of the servants dispatched for the officer, Mr. Forester and Mr. Falkland with∣drew, and left me in the custody of two others.</P>
<P>One of these was the servant who had gone in pursuit of me and found me at the market-town from whence I had intended to take coach for Lon∣don. I was willing accurately to discover the state of mind of those who had been witnesses of this scene, and who had had some previous opportunity of observing my character and manners. I therefore endeavoured to open a conversation with him. Well, my good Thomas, said I, in a querulous tone and with a hesitating manner, am I not a most miserable creature?</P>
<P>Do n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> speak to me, master Williams! You have given me a shock that I shall not get the better of for one while. You were hatched by a hen, as the saying is, but you came of the spawn of a cocka∣trice. I am glad to my heart, that honest farmer
<PB N="22" REF="028752_0250_0FDBF204195CD410"/>
Williams is dead, your villany would else have made him curse the day that ever he was born.</P>
<P>Thomas, I am innocent! I swear by the great God that shall judge me another day, I am inno∣cent!</P>
<P>Pray, do not swear! for goodness sake, do not swear! Your poor soul is damned enough without that. For your sake, lad, I will never take any body's word, nor trust to appearances, thof it should be an angel. Lord bless us! how smoothly you palavered it over, for all the world as if you had been as fair as a new-born babe! But it will not do; you will never be able to persuade peo∣ple that black is white. For my own part I have done with you. I loved you yesterday, all one as if you had been my own brother. To day I love you so well, that I would go ten miles with all the pleasure in life to see you hanged.</P>
<P>Good God! Thomas, have you the heart? What a change! I call God to witness I have done no∣thing to deserve it! What a world do we live in!</P>
<P>Hold your tongue, boy! It makes my very heart sick to hear you! I would not lay a night under the same roof with you for all the world! I should ex∣pect the house to fall and crush such wickedness! I admire that the earth does not open and swallow you alive! It is poison so much as to look at you! If you go on at this hardened rate, I believed from my soul that the people you talk to will tear you to pieces, and you will never live to come to the gal∣lows. Oh, yes, you do well to pity yourself: poor, tender thing! that spit venom all round you like a toad, and leave the very ground upon which you crawl infected with your slime.</P>
<P>Finding the person with whom I talked thus im∣penetrable to all I could say, and considering that the advantage to be gained was but small even if I
<PB N="23" REF="028752_0251_0FDBF1C8EFF12D98"/>
could overcome his prepossession, I took his advice and was silent. It was not much longer before every thing was prepared for my departure, and I was conducted to the same prison which had so lately inclosed the wretched and innocent Haw∣kinses. They too had been the victims of Mr. Falkland. He exhibited, upon a very contracted scale indeed, but in which the truth of delineation was faithfully sustained, a copy of what monarchs are, who reckon among the instruments of their power prisons of state.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>FOR my own part I had never seen a prison, and like the majority of my brethren had given myself little concern to enquire what was the con∣dition of those who committed offence against, or became obnoxious to suspicion from the community. Oh, how enviable is the most tottering shed under which the labourer retires to rest, compared with the residence of these walls!</P>
<P>To me every thing was new, the massy doors, the resounding locks, the gloomy passages, the grated windows, and the characteristic looks of the keepers, accustomed to reject every petition, and to steel their hearts against feeling and pity. Cu∣riosity and a sense of my situation induced me to fix my eyes on the faces of these men, but in a few minutes I drew them away with unconquer∣able loathing. It is impossible to describe the sort of squalidness and filth with which these mansions are distinguished. I have seen dirty faces in dirty apartments, which have nevertheless borne the impression of health, and spoke carelessness and le∣vity rather than distress. But the dirt of a prison speaks sadness to the heart, and appears to be alrea∣dy in a state of putridity and infection.</P>
<P>I was detained for more than an hour in the apart∣ment of the keeper, one turnkey after another coming in, that they might make themselves fami∣liar with my person. As I was already considered
<PB N="25" REF="028752_0253_0FDBF1CA5C5C3D18"/>
as guilty of felony to a considerable amount, I underwent a rigorous search, and they took from me a penknife, a pair of scissars, and that part of my money which was in gold. It was debated whether or not these should be sealed up, to be re∣turned to me, as they said, as soon as I should be acquitted; and had I not displayed an unexpected firmness of manner and vigour of expostulation, such was the conduct that would have been pur∣sued. Having undergone these ceremonies, I was thrust into a day-room in which all the persons then under confinement for felony were assembled, to the number of eleven. Each of them was too much engaged in his own reflections to take notice of me. Of these two were imprisoned for horse-stealing, and three for having stolen a sheep, one for shop-lifting, one for coining, two for highway-robbery and two for burglary.</P>
<P>The horse-stealers were engaged in a game at cards, which was presently interrupted by a dif∣ference of opinion, attended with great vocifera∣tion, they calling upon one and another to decide it to no purpose, one paying no attention to their summons, and another leaving them in the midst of their story, being no longer able to endure his own internal anguish in the midst of their mum∣mery.</P>
<P>It is a custom among thieves to constitute a sort of mock tribunal of their own body, from whose decision every one is informed whether he shall be acquitted, respited or pardoned, as well as respect∣ing the most skilful way of conducting his de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence. One of the housebreakers who had already passed this ordeal was stalking up and down the room with a forced bravery, exclaiming to his companion that he was as rich as the duke of Bedford himself. He had five gui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>as and a half, which was as much
<PB N="26" REF="028752_0254_0FDBF2098D54D780"/>
as he could possibly spend in the course of the en∣suing month, and what happened after that it was Jack Ketch's business to see to, not his. As he uttered these words he threw himself abruptly upon a bench that was near him, and seemed to be asleep in a moment. But his sleep was uneasy and dis∣turbed, his breathing was hard, and at intervals had rather the nature of a groan. A young fellow from the other side of the room came softly to the place where he lay with a large knife in his hand, and pressed the back of it with such violence upon his neck, the head hanging over the side of the bench, that it was not till after several efforts that he was able to rise. Oh, Jack! cried this manual jester, I had almost done your business for you! The other expressed no marks of resentment, but sullenly answered, Damn you, why did not you take the edge? It would have been the best thing you have done this many a day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This incident really occurred, and was witnessed by a friend of the author a few years since in Newgate.</NOTE>!</P>
<P>The case of one of the persons committed for highway-robbery was not a little extraordinary. He was a common soldier, of a most engaging physiognomy, and two and twenty years of age. The prosecutor, who had been robbed one evening as he returned very late from the alehouse, of the sum of three shillings, swore positively to his per∣son. The character of the prisoner was such as has seldom been equalled. The meanness of his condition did not preclude him from the pursuit of intellectual cultivation; and he drew his favourite amusement from the works of Virgil and Horace. His integrity had been proverbially great. In one instance he had been employed by a lady to convey a sum of a thousand pounds to a person at some

miles distance: in another he was intrusted by a gentleman during his absence with the care of his house and furniture to the value of at least five times that sum. His habits of thinking were pe∣culiar, full of justice, simplicity and wisdom. He from time to time earned money of his officers by his peculiar excellence in furbishing arms; but he declined offers that had been made him to become a serjeant or a corporal, saying, that he did not want money, and that in a new situation he should have less leisure for study. He was equally con∣stant in refusing presents that were offered him by persons that had been struck with his merit: not that he was under the influence of false delicacy and pride, but that his conscience would not allow him to accept that, the want of which he did not feel to be an evil.

<P>The whole day I was obliged to spend in the company of these men, some of them having really committed the actions laid to their charge, others whom their ill fortune had rendered the victims of suspicion. The whole was a scene of misery such as nothing short of actual observation can suggest to the mind. Some were noisy and obstreperous, endeavouring by a false bravery to keep at bay the remembrance of their condition; while others, incapable even of this effort, had the torment of their thoughts aggravated by the perpetual noise and confusion that prevailed around them. In the faces of those who assumed the most courage you might trace the furrows of anxious care, and in the midst of their laboured hilarity dreadful ideas would ever and anon intrude, convulsing their features and
<PB N="28" REF="028752_0256_0FDBF20F8899E780"/>
working every line into an expression of the keenest agony. To these men the sun brought no return of joy. Day after day ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed on, but their state was immutable. Existence was to them a theatre of invariable melancholy; every moment was a moment of anguish, yet di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they wish to prolong that moment, fearful that the coming period would bring a severer fate. The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thought of the past with insupportable repenta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, each man contented to give his right hand, to have again the choice of that peace and liberty which he had unthinkingly bartered away. We talk of instruments of tor∣ture; Englishmen take credit to themselves for having banished the use of them from their happy shore! Alas, he that has observed the secrets of a prison, well knows that there is infinitely more tor∣ture in the lingering existence of a criminal, in the silent, intolerable minutes that he spends, than in the tangible misery of whips and racks!</P>
<P>Such were our days. At sun-set our jailors ap∣peared, and ordered each man to come away, and be locked into his dungeon. It was a bitter ag∣gravation of our fate to be under the arbitrary controul of these fellows. They felt no man's sor∣row; they were of all men least capable of any sort of feeling. They had a barbarous and sullen pleasure in issuing their detested mandates, and observing the mournful reluctance with which they were obeyed. Whatever they directed, it was in vain to expostulate; setters and bread and water were the sure consequences of resistance. Their tyranny had no other limit than their own caprice; to whom shall the unfortunate felon appeal? To what purpose complain, when his complaints are sure to be received with incredulity? A tale of mutiny and necessary precaution is the unfailing
<PB N="29" REF="028752_0257_0FDBF1D2A21E5C18"/>
refuge of the keeper, and this tale is an everlast∣ing bar against redress.</P>
<P>Our dungeons were cell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 7½ feet by 6½, below the surface of the ground, damp, without window, light or air, except from a few holes worked for that purpose in the door. In some of these misera∣ble receptacles three persons were put to sleep to∣gether<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Howard on Prisons.</NOTE>. I was fortunate enough to have one to myself. It was now the approach of winter. We were not allowed to have candles; and, as I have already said, were thrust in here at sun-set and not liberated till the returning day. This was our situ∣ation for fourteen or fifteen hours out of the four and twenty I had never been accustomed to sleep more than six or seven hours, and my inclination to sleep was now less than ever. Thus was I re∣duced to spend half my day in this dreary abode and in compleat darkness. This was no trifling aggravation of my lot.</P>
<P>Among my melancholy reflections I tasked my memory, and counted over the doors, the lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ks, the chains, the massy walls and grated windows that were between me and liberty. These, said I, are the engines that tyranny sits down in cold and serious meditation to invent. This is the empire that man exercises over man. Thus is a being, formed to expatiate, to act, to smile and enjoy, restricted and benumbed. How great must be his depravity or heedlessness who vindicates this scheme for changing health and gaiety and serenity, into the wanness of a dungeon and the deep furrows of agony and despair!</P>
<P>Thank God, exclaims the Englishman, we have no Bastille! Thank God, with us no man can be punished without a crime! Unthinking wretch!
<PB N="30" REF="028752_0258_0FDBF210D2E1B998"/>
Is that a country of liberty where thousands lan∣guish in dungeons and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tters? Go, go, ignorant fool! and visit the scenes of our prisons! witness their unwholesomeness, their filth, the tyranny of their governors, the misery of their inmates! Af∣ter that shew me the man shameless enough to tri∣umph, and say, England has no Bastille! Is there any charge so frivolous upon which men are not consigned to these detested abodes? Is there any villainy that is not practised by justices and prose∣cutors? But against all this, perhaps you have been told, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e is redress. Yes, a redress, that it is the consummation of insult so much as to name! Where shall the poor wretch, reduced to the last despair, and to whom acquittal perhaps comes just time enough to save him from perishing,—where shall this man find leisure, and much less money, to see counsel and officers, and purchase the tedious, dear-bought remedy of the law? No, he is too happy to leave his dungeon and the memory of his dungeon behind him; and the same tyranny and wanton oppression become the inheritance of his successor.</P>
<P>For myself I looked round upon my walls, and forward upon the premature death I had too much reason to expect; I consulted my own heart that whispered nothing but innocence; and I said, This is society. This is the object, the distribution of justice, which is the end of human reason. For this sages have toiled, and the midnight oil has been wasted. This!</P>
<P>The reader will forgive this digression from the immediate subject of my story. If it should be said, these are general remarks; let it be remem∣bered that they are the dear-bought result of ex∣perience. It is from the fulness of a bursting heart that invective thus flows to my pen. These
<PB N="31" REF="028752_0259_0FDBF1D4D1A618D0"/>
are not the declamations of a man desirous to be eloquent. I have felt the iron slavery grating upon my soul.</P>
<P>I believed that misery, more pure than that which I now endured, had never fallen to the lot of a human being. I recollected with astonishment my puerile eagerness to be brought to the test and have my innocence examined. I execrated it as the vilest and most insufferable pedantry. I exclaimed in the bitterness of my heart, Of what value is a fair fame? It is the jewel of men formed to be amused with baubles. Without it I might have had sere∣nity of heart and chearfulness of occupation, peace and liberty; why should I consign my happiness to other men's arbitration? But, if a fair fame were of the most inexpressible value, is this the method which common sense would prescribe to retrieve it? The language which these institutions hold out to the unfortunate is, Come, and be shut out from the light of day, be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he associate of those whom society has marked out for her abhorrence, be the slave of jailers, be loaded with fetters; thus shall you be cleared from every unworthy asper∣sion, and restored to reputation and honour! This is the consolation she affords to those whose malig∣nity or folly, private pique or unfounded posi∣tiveness have without the smallest foundation loaded with calumny. For myself I felt my own inno∣cence, and I soon found upon enquiry that three-fourths of those who are regularly subjected to a similar treatment, are persons, whom even with all the superciliousness and precipitation of our courts of justice no evidence can be found to convict. How slender then must be that man's portion of information and discernment, who is willing to commit his character and welfare to such guardianship!</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="028752_0260_0FDBF216174605E8"/>
But my case was even worse than this. I inti∣mately felt that a trial, such as institution is able to make it, is only the worthy sequel of such a be∣ginning. What chance had I, after the purgation I was now suffering, that I should come out ac∣quitted at last? What probability was there that the trial I had just endured in the house of Mr. Falkland was not just as fair as any that might be expected to follow? No, I have already antici∣pated my own condemnation.</P>
<P>Thus was I cut off for ever from all that exist∣ence has to bestow, from all the high hopes I had so often conceived, from all the future excellence my soul so much delighted to imagine, to spend a few weeks in a miserable prison, and then to perish by the hands of the public executioner. No lan∣guage can do justice to the indignant and soul-sickening loathing that these ideas excited. My resentment was not restricted to my prosecutor, but extended itself to take in the whole machine of human society. I could never believe that all this was the fair result of institutions inseparable from the general good. I regarded the whole human species as so many hangmen and torturers. I con∣sidered them as confederated to tear me to pieces; and this wide scene of inexorable persecution in∣flicted upon me inexpressible agony. I looked on this side and on that; I was innocent, I had a right to expect assistance; but every heart was ready to lend its force to make my ruin secure. No man that has not f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lt in his own most momentous con∣cerns justice, eternal truth, unalterable equity en∣gaged in his behalf; and on the other side brute force, impenetrable obstinacy and unfeeling inso∣lence, can imagine the sensations that then passed through my mind. I saw treachery triumphant and enthroned; I saw the sinews of innocence crumbled into dust by the gripe of almighty guilt.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="028752_0261_0FDBF1D650B1B650"/>
What relief had I from these sensations? Was it relief that I spent the day in the midst of pro∣fligacy and execrations, that I saw reflected from every countenance agonies only inferior to my own? He that would form a lively idea of the re∣gions of the damned, needed only to witness for six hours a scene to which I was confined for many months. Not for one hour could I withdraw my∣self from this complexity of horrors, or take re∣fuge in the calmness of meditation. Air, exer∣cise, series, contrast, those grand enliveners of the human frame, I was for ever debarred, by the in∣exorable tyranny under which I was fallen. Nor did I find the solitude of my nightly dungeon less insupportable. Its only furniture was the straw that served me for my repose. It was narrow, damp and unwholesome. The slumbers of a mind, wearied like mine with the most detestable uni∣formity, to whom neither amusement nor occupa∣tion ever offered themselves to beguile the painful hours, were short, disturbed and unrefreshing. My sleeping, still more than my waking thoughts, were full of perplexity, deformity and disorder. To these slumbers succeeded the hours which by the regulations of our prison I was obliged though awake to spend in solitary and chearless darkness. Here I had neither books, nor pens, nor any thing upon which to engage my attention; all was a sightless blank. How was a mind, active and in∣defatigable like mine, to endure this misery? I could not sink it in lethargy; I could not forget my woes; they haunted me with unintermitted and demoniac malice. Cruel, inexorable policy of human affairs, that condemns a man to torture like this, that sanctions it and knows not what is done under its sanction; that is too supine and unfeeling to enquire into these p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y details; that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this

the ordeal of innocence and the protector of free∣dom! A thousand times I could have dashed my brains against the walls of my dungeon; a thou∣sand times I longed for death, and wished with in∣expressible ardour for an end to what I suffered; a thousand times I meditated suicide, and ruminated in the bitterness of my soul upon the different means of escaping from the load of existence. What had I to do with life? I had seen enough to make me regard it with detestation. Why should I wait the lingering process of legal despotism, and not dare so much as to die but when and how its instruments decreed? Still some inexplicable suggestion withheld my hand. I clung with des∣perate fondness to this shadow of existence, its mysterious attractions and its hopeless prospects.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>SUCH were the reflections that haunted the first days of my imprisonment, in consequence of which they were spent in perpetual anguish. But after a time nature, wearied with distress, would no longer stoop to the burthen; thought, which is incessantly varying, introduced a series of re∣flections totally different.</P>
<P>My fortitude revived. I had always been ac∣customed to chearfulness, good-humour and sere∣nity, and this habit now returned to visit me at the bottom of my dungeon. No sooner did my contemplations take this turn, than I saw the rea∣sonableness and possibility of tranquillity and peace, and my mind whispered to me the propriety of showing in this forlorn condition that I was supe∣rior to all my persecutors. Blessed state of inno∣cence and self-approbation! The sunshine of con∣scious integrity pierced through all the harriers of my cell, and spoke ten thousand times more joy to my heart than the accumulated splendours of na∣ture and art can communicate to the slaves of vice.</P>
<P>I found out the secret of employing my mind. I said, I am shut up for half the day in total dark∣ness without any external source of amusement; the other half I spend in the midst of noise, tur∣bulence and confusion. What then? Can I not draw amusement from the stores of my own mind? Is it not freighted with various knowledge? Have I not been employed from my infancy in gratifying an insatiable curiosity? When should I derive be∣nefit
<PB N="36" REF="028752_0264_0FDBF21C983985D8"/>
from these superior advantages, if not at pre∣sent? Accordingly I tasked the stores of my me∣mory and my powers of invention. I amused my∣self with recollecting the history of my life. By degrees I called to mind a number of minute cir∣cumstances which but for this exercise would have been for ever forgotten. I repassed in my thoughts whole conversations, I recollected their subjects, their arrangement, their incidents and frequently their very words. I mused upon these ideas till I was totally absorbed in thought. I repeated them till my mind glowed with enthusiasm. I had my different employments fitted for the solitude of the night in which I could give full scope to the im∣pulses of my mind, and the uproar of the day in which my chief object was to be insensible to the disorder with which I was surrounded.</P>
<P>By degrees I quitted my own story, and amused myself with imaginary adventures. I figured to myself every situation in which I could be placed, and conceived the conduct to be observed in each. Thus scenes of insult and danger, of tenderness and oppression became familiar to me. In fancy I often passed the awful hour of dissolving nature. In some of my reveries I boiled with impetuous indignation, and in others patiently collected the whole force of my mind for some fearful encoun∣ter. I cultivated the powers of oratory suited to these different states, and improved more in elo∣quence in the solitude of my dungeon, than per∣haps I should have done in the busiest and most crowded scenes At length I proceeded to as re∣gular a disposition of my time, as the man in his study who passes from mathematics to poetry, and from poetry to the law of nations in the different parts of each single day; and I as seldom infringed upon my plan. Nor were my subjects of disqui∣sition
<PB N="37" REF="028752_0265_0FDBF1DAD19DF6C8"/>
less numerous than his. I went over, by the assistance of memory only, a considerable part of Euclid during my confinement, and revived day after day the series of facts and incidents in some of the most celebrated historians.</P>
<P>While I was thus employed I reflected with ex∣ultation upon the degree in which man is inde∣pendent of the smiles and frowns of fortune. I was beyond her reach, for I could fall no lower. To an ordinary eye I might seem destitute and miserable, but in reality I wanted for nothing. My fare was coarse; but I was in health. My dungeon was noisome; but I felt no inconvenience. I was shut up from the usual means of exercise and air; but I found the method of exercising my∣self even to perspiration in my dungeon. I had no means of withdrawing my person from a disgustful society in the most chearful and valuable part of the day; but I soon brought to perfection the art of withdrawing my thoughts, and saw and heard the people about me for just as short a time and as seldom as I pleased.</P>
<P>Such is man in himself considered; so simple his nature; so few his wants. How different from the man of artificial society! Palaces are built for his reception, a thousand vehicles provided for his exercise, provinces are ransacked for the gratifica∣tion of his appetite, and the whole world traversed to supply him with apparel and furniture. Thus vast is his expenditure, and the purchase slavery. He is dependent on a thousand accidents for tran∣quillity and health, and his body and soul are at the devotion of whoever will satisfy his imperious cravings.</P>
<P>In addition to the disadvantages of my present situation, I was reserved for an ignominious death. What then? Every man must die. No man
<PB N="38" REF="028752_0266_0FDBF21DD6E8FD80"/>
knows how soon. It surely is not worse to en∣counter the king of terrors in health and with every advantage for the collection of fortitude, than to encounter him already half subdued by sickness, and suffering. I was resolved at least fully to pos∣sess the days I had to live, and this is peculiarly in the power of the man who preserves his health to the last moment of his existence. Why should I suffer my mind to be invaded by unavailing re∣grets? Every sentiment of vanity, or rather of independence and justice within me, instigated me to say to my persecutor, You may cut off my ex∣istence, but you cannot disturb my serenity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>IN the midst of these reflections another thought, which had not before struck me, occurred to my mind. I exult, said I, and reasonably, over the impotence of my persecutor. Is not that impo∣tence greater than I have yet imagined? I say, he may cut off my existence, but cannot disturb my serenity. It is true: my mind, the clearness of my spirit, the firmness of my temper, are be∣yond his reach; is not my life equally so, if I please? What are the material obstacles that man never subdued? What is the undertaking so ar∣duous that by some has not been accomplished? And, if by others, why not by me? Had they stronger motives than I? Was existence more va∣riously endeared to them, or had they more nu∣merous methods by which to animate and adorn it? Many of those who have exerted most perse∣verance and intrepidity were obviously my inferiors in that respect. Why should not I be as daring as they? Adamant and steel have a ductility like water to a mind sufficiently bold and contemplative. The mind is its own place; and is endowed with pow∣ers that might enable it to laugh at the tyrant's vigilance. I passed and repassed these ideas in my mind; and, heated with the contemplation, I said, No, I will not die!</P>
<P>My reading in early youth had been extremely miscellaneous. I had read of housebreakers to whom locks and bolts were a jest, and who, vain of their art, exhibited the experiment of entering
<PB N="40" REF="028752_0268_0FDBF2241BCE9F30"/>
a house the most strongly barricaded, with as little noise and almost as little trouble as other men would lift up a latch. This circumstance had caught my attention. There is nothing so interest∣ing to the juvenile mind as the wonderful; there is no power that it so eagerly covets as that of astonishing spectators by its miraculous exertions. Mind appeared to my untutored reflections vague, airy and unfettered, the susceptible perceiver of reasons, but never intended by nature to be the slave of force. Why should it be in the power of man to overtake and hold me by force? Why, when I choose to withdraw myself, should I not be capable of eluding the most vigilant search? These limbs and this trunk are a cumbrous and unfor∣tunate load for the power of thinking to drag along with it; but why should not the power of thinking be able to lighten the load till it shall be no longer felt?—These early modes of reflection were by no means indifferent to my present enquiries.</P>
<P>Our next-door neighbour at my father's house had been a carpenter. Fresh from the sort of reading, I have mentioned, I was eager to examine his tools, their powers and their uses. This car∣penter was a man of a strong and vigorous mind; and, his faculties having been chiefly confined to the range of his profession, he was fertile in expe∣riments and ingenious in reasoning upon these particular topics. I therefore obtained from him considerable satisfaction; and, my mind being set in action, I sometimes even improved upon the hints he furnished. His conversation was particu∣larly agreeable to me; I at first worked with him sometimes for my amusement, and afterwards occa∣sionally for a short time as his journeyman. I was constitutionally vigorous, my bones well knit, and my limbs sinewy and powerful; and by the expe∣rience
<PB N="41" REF="028752_0269_0FDBF2251882BFF0"/>
thus attained I added to the abstract posses∣sion of power the skill of applying it, when I pleased, in such a manner as that no part should be inefficient.</P>
<P>It is a strange, but no uncommon feature in the human mind, that the very resource of which we stand in greatest need in a critical situation, though already accumulated it may be by preceding in∣dustry, fails to present itself at the time when it should be called into action. Thus my mind had passed through two very different stages since my imprisonment, before this means of liberation sug∣gested itself. My faculties were overwhelmed in the first instance, and raised to a pitch of enthu∣siasm in the second, while in both I took it for granted in a manner that I must passively submit to the good pleasure of my persecutors.</P>
<P>During the period in which my mind had been thus undecided, the assizes, which were held twice a year in the town in which I was a prisoner, came on. Upon this occasion my case was not brought forward, but was suffered to stand over six months longer. It would have been just the same, if I had had as strong reason to expect acquittal, as I had conviction. If I had been apprehended upon the most frivolous reasons upon which any justice of the peace ever thought proper to commit a naked beggar for trial, I must still have waited about two hundred and seventeen days, before my innocence could be cleared. So imperfect are the effects of the boasted laws of a country whose legislators hold their assembly from four to six months in every year! I never certainly discover∣ed whether this delay were owing to any inter∣ference on the part <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f my prosecutor, or whether it fell out in the regular administration of justice, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oo solemn and dignified to accommodate
<PB N="42" REF="028752_0270_0FDBD6CF3805F310"/>
itself to the rights or benefit of an insignificant individual.</P>
<P>The term of my imprisonment was thus unac∣countably prolonged. But this was not the only incident that occurred to me during my confine∣ment for which I could find no satisfactory solu∣tion. It was nearly at the same time, that is, when I had been little more than a month in durance, that the keeper began to alter his behaviour to me. He sent for me one morning into the part of the building which was appropriated for his own use, and after some hesitation told me he was sorry my accommodations had been so indifferent, and asked whether I should like to have a chamber in his family? I was struck with the unexpectedness of this question, and desired to know whether any body had employed him to ask it. No, he replied; but, now the assizes were over, he had fewer felons on his hands, and more time to look about him: He believed I was a good kind of a young man; and he had taken a sort of a liking to me. I fixed my eye upon his countenance as he said this. I could discover none of the usual symp∣toms of kindness; he appeared to me to be acting a part, unnatural and that sat with aukwardness upon him. He went on however to offer me the liberty of eating at his table, which, if I chose it, he said would make no difference to him, and he should not think of charging me any thing for it. He had always indeed as much upon his hands as one person could see to; but his wife and his daughter Peggy would be woundily pleased to hear a person of learning talk, as he understood I was; and perhaps I might not feel myself disagreeable in their company.</P>
<P>I reflected on this proposal, and had little doubt, notwithstanding what the keeper had affirmed to
<PB N="43" REF="028752_0271_0FDBF1E90AE93680"/>
the contrary, that it did not proceed from any spontaneous humanity in him, but that he had, to speak the language of persons of his cast, good reasons for what he did. I busied myself in con∣jectures as to who could be the author of this sort of indulgence and attention. The two most likely persons were Mr. Falkland and Mr. Forester. The latter I knew to be a man austere and inexorable towards those whom he deemed vicious. He piqued himself upon being insensible to those softer emo∣tions, which he believed to answer no other pur∣pose than to seduce us from our duty. Mr. Falk∣land on the contrary was a man of the acutest sen∣sibility; hence arose his pleasures and his pains, his virtues and his vices. Though he were the bitterest enemy to whom I could possibly be ex∣posed, and though no sentiments of humanity could divert or controul the bent of his mind, I yet per∣suaded myself that he was more likely than his kinsman to visit in idea the scene of my dungeon, and to feel impelled to alleviate my sufferings.</P>
<P>This conjecture was by no means calculated to serve as balm to my mind. My thoughts were unavoidably full of irritation against my persecutor. How could I think kindly of a man, in compe∣tition with the gratification of whose ruling passion my good name or my life was deemed as of no consideration? I saw him crushing the one and bringing the other into jeopardy, with a quietness and composure on his part that I could not recol∣lect without horror. I knew not what were his plans respecting me. I knew not whether he trou∣bled himself so much as to form a barren wish for the preservation of one, whose future prospects he had so iniquitously tarnished. I had hitherto been silent as to my principal topic of recrimination. But I was by no means certain that I should con∣sent
<PB N="44" REF="028752_0272_0FDBF239C95D8D70"/>
to go out of the world in silence, the victim of this man's obduracy and art. In every view I felt my heart ulcerated with a sense of his injus∣tice; and my very soul spurned these pitiful indul∣gences, at a time that he was grinding me into dust with the inexorableness of his vengeance.</P>
<P>I was influenced by these sentiments in my re∣ply to the jailor; and I found a secret pleasure in pronouncing them in all their bitterness. I viewed him with a sarcastic smile, and said, I was glad to find him of a sudden become so humane: I was not however without some penetration as to the humanity of a jailor, and could guess at the cir∣cumstances by which it was produced. But he might tell his employer that his cares were fruit∣less; I would accept no favours from a man that held a halter about my neck, and had courage enough to endure the worst both in time to come and now.—The jailor looked at me with astonish∣ment, and, turning upon his heel, exclaimed, Well done, my cock! You have not had your learning for nothing I see. You are set upon not dying dunghill. But that is to come, lad: you had better by half keep your courage till you shall find it wanted.</P>
<P>The assizes, which passed over without influence to me, produced a great revolution among my fellow prisoners. I lived long enough in the jail to witness a general mutation of its inhabitants. One of the housebreakers and the coiner were hanged. Two more were cast for transportation, and the rest acquitted. The transports remained with us; and, though the prison was thus lighten∣ed of nine of its inhabitants, I left within three as many persons on the felons' side as I had found there on my first arrival.</P>

The soldier, whose story I have already record∣ed, died, on the evening of the very day on which the judges arrived, of a disease the consequence of his confinement. Such was the justice that re∣sulted from the laws of his country, to an indivi∣dual who would have been the ornament of any age, one who of all the men I ever knew was in∣expressibly the kindest, of the most feeling heart, of the most engaging and unaffected manners, and the most unblemished life. The name of this man was Brightwel. Were it possible for my pen to consecrate him to never dying fame, I could un∣dertake no task more grateful to my heart. His judgment was penetrating and manly, totally un∣mixed with imbecility and confusion, while at the same time there was such an uncontending frank∣ness in his countenance, that a superficial observer would have supposed he must have been the prey of the first plausible knavery that was practised against him. Great reason have I to remember him with affection! He was the most ardent, and I had almost said the last of my friends. Nor did I remain in this respect in his debt. There was indeed a great congeniality, if I may presume to say so, in our characters, except that I cannot pre∣tend to rival the magnitude of his genius, or to compare with, what the world has scarcely sur∣passed, the correctness and untainted purity of his conduct. He heard my story, as far as I thought proper to disclose it, with interest, he examined it with sincere impartiality, and, if at first any doubt remained upon his mind, a frequent observation of me in my most unguarded moments taught him in no long time to place an unreserved confidence in my innocence.</P>
<P>He talked of the injustice of which we were mutually victims without bitterness, and predicted
<PB N="46" REF="028752_0274_0FDBF22BD3D13630"/>
that the time would come when the possibility of such intolerable oppression would be extirpated. But this, he said, was a happiness reserved for poste∣rity; it was too late for us to reap the benefit of it. It was some consolation to him, that he could not tell the period in his past life, which the best judg∣ment of which he was capable would teach him to spend better. He could say, with as much reason as most men, he had discharged his duty. But he foresaw that he should not survive his present cala∣mity. This was his prediction, while yet in his health. He might be said in a certain sense to have a broken heart. But, if that phrase were in any way applicable to him, sure never was despair more calm, more full of resignation and serenity.</P>
<P>At no time in the whole course of my adven∣tures was I exposed to a shock more severe than I received from this man's death. The circumstan∣ces of his fate presented themselves to my mind in their full complication of iniquity. From him and the execrations with which I loaded the government that could be the instrument of his tragedy, I turned to myself. I beheld the catastrophe of Brightwel with envy. A thousand times I longed that my corse had laid in death, instead of his. I was only reserved, as I persuaded myself, for un∣utterable woe. In a few days he would have been acquitted, his liberty, his reputation restored; man∣kind perhaps, struck with the injustice he had suf∣fered, would have shown themselves eager to ba∣lance his misfortunes and obliterate his disgrace. But this man died; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> remained alive! I, who, though not less wrongfully treated than he, had no hope of reparation, must be marked as long I lived for a villain, and in my death probably held up to the scorn and detestation of my species!</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="028752_0275_0FDBF1ECD52EC678"/>
Such were some of the immediate reflections which the fate of this unfortunate martyr produced in my mind. Yet my intercourse with Brightwel was not in the review without its portion of com∣fort. I said, This man has seen through the veil of calumny that overshades me; he has under∣stood, and has loved me. Why should I despair? May I not meet hereafter with men ingenuous like him, who shall do me justice and sympathise with my calamity? With that consolation I will be sa∣tisfied. I will rest in the arms of friendship, and forget the malignity of the world. Henceforth I will be contented with tranquil obscurity, with the cultivation of sentiment and wisdom, and the ex∣ercise of benevolence within a narrow circle. It was thus that my mind became excited to the pro∣ject I was about to undertake.</P>
<P>I had no sooner meditated the idea of an escape, than I determined upon the following method of facilitating the preparations for it. I undertook to ingratiate myself with my keeper. In the world I have generally sound such persons as had been acquainted with the outline of my story, regarding me with a sort of loathing and abhorrence, which made them avoid me with as much care as if I had been spotted with the plague. The idea of my having first robbed my master, and then endea∣voured to clear myself by charging him with sub∣ornation against me, placed me in a class distinct from and infinitely more guilty than that of com∣mon felons. But this man was too good a master of his profession to entertain aversion against a fel∣low creature upon such a score. He considered the persons committed to his custody merely as so many human bodies for whom he was responsible that they should be forthcoming in time and place; and the difference of innocence and guilt he looked
<PB N="48" REF="028752_0276_0FDBF22D52899EE8"/>
down upon as an affair beneath his attention. I had not therefore the prejudices to encounter in recommending myself to him, that I have found so peculiarly obstinate in many other cases. Add to which, the same motive, whatever it was, that had made him so profuse in his offers a little be∣fore, had probably its influence on the present oc∣casion.</P>
<P>I informed him of my skill in the profession of a joiner, and offered to make him half a dozen hand∣some chairs, if he would facilitate my obtaining the tools necessary for carrying on my profession in my present confinement; for, without his consent pre∣viously obtained, it would have been in vain for me to expect that I could quietly exert an industry of this kind, even if my existence had depended upon it. He looked at me first as asking himself what he was to understand by this novel proposal, and then, most graciously relaxing, said, he was glad I was come off a little of my high notions and my buckram, and he would see what he could do. Two days after he signified his compliance. He said that, as to the matter of the present I had offered him, he thought nothing of that, I might do as I pleased in it; but I might depend upon every civility from him that he could show with safety to himself, if so be as, when he was civil, I did not offer a second time to snap and take him up short.</P>
<P>Having thus gained my preliminary, I gradu∣ally accumulated tools or various sorts, gimlets, piercers, chissels, <HI>et cetera.</HI> I immediately set myself to work. The nights were long, and the sordid eagerness of my keeper notwithstanding his ostentatious generosity was great; I therefore petitioned and was indulged with a bit of, candle that I might amuse myself for an hour or two with
<PB N="49" REF="028752_0277_0FDBF1F170D71510"/>
my work after I was locked up in my dungeon. I did not however by any means apply constantly to the work I had undertaken, and my jailor betrayed various tokens of impatience. Perhaps he was afraid I should not have finished it before I was hanged. I however insisted upon working at my leisure as I pleased, and this he did not venture expressly to dispute. In addition to the advan∣tages thus obtained, I procured secretly from Miss Peggy, who now and then came into the jail to make her observations of the prisoners, and who seemed to have conceived some partiality for my person, the implement of an iron crow.</P>
<P>In these proceedings it is easy to trace the vice and duplicity that must be expected to grow out of injustice. I know not whether my readers will pardon the sinister advantage I extracted from the mysterious concessions of my keeper. But I must acknowledge my weakness in that respect; I am writing my adventures and not my apology: and I was not prepared to maintain the unvaried since∣rity of my manners, at the expence of a speedy close to be put upon my existence.</P>
<P>My plan was now digested. I believed that by means of the crow I could easily and without much noise force the door of my dungeon from its hinges, or, if not, that I could, in case of ne∣cessity, cut away the lock. This door led into a narrow passage, bounded on one side by the range of dungeons, and on the other by the jailor's and turnkey's apartments, through which was the usual entrance from the street. This outlet I dared not attempt for fear of disturbing the persons close to whose very door I should in that case have found it necessary to pass. I determined therefore upon another door at the farther end of the pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ge, which was barricaded, and which led to a sort of
<PB N="50" REF="028752_0278_0FDBF231D1498D68"/>
a garden in the occupation of the keeper. This gar∣den I had never entered, but I had had an opportu∣nity of observing it from the window of the felons' day room, which looked that way, the room itself being immediately over the range of dungeons. I perceived that it was bounded by a wall of consi∣derable height, which I was told by my fellow pri∣soners was the extremity of the jail on that side, and beyond which was a back-lane of some length that terminated upon the skirts of the town. Upon an accurate observation and much reflection upon the subject I found that I should be able, if once I got into the garden, with my gimblets and piercers inserted at proper distances to make a sort of lad∣der, by means of which I could get clear over the wall, and once more take possession of the sweets of liberty. I preferred this wall to that which im∣mediately skirted my dungeon, on the other side of which was a populous street.</P>
<P>I suffered about two days to elapse from the pe∣riod at which I had thoroughly digested my pro∣ject, and then in the very middle of the night be∣gan to set about its execution. The first door was attended with considerable difficulty, but at length this obstacle was happily removed. The second door was fastened on the inside. I was therefore able with perfect ease to push back the bolts. But the lock, which of course was depended upon for the principal security, and was therefore strong, was double-shot, and the key taken away. I en∣deavoured with my chissel to force back the bolt of the lock, but to no purpose. I then unscrewed the box of the lock; and, that being taken away, the door was no longer opposed to my wishes.</P>
<P>Thus far I had proceeded with the happiest suc∣cess, but close on the other side of the door there was a kennel with a large mastiff dog, of which I
<PB N="51" REF="028752_0279_0FDBF2342F3CD988"/>
had not the smallest previous knowledge. Though I stepped along in the most careful manner, this animal was disturbed and began to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ark. I was extremely disconcerted, but immediately applied myself to soothe the animal, in which I presently succeeded. I then returned along the passage to listen whether any body had been disturbed by the noise of the dog; resolved, if that were the case, that I would return to my dungeon, and endeavour to replace every thing in its former state. But the whole appeared perfectly quiet, and I was encou∣raged to proceed in my operation.</P>
<P>I now got to the wall, and had nearly gained half the ascent, when I heard a voice at the garden door, crying, Holloa! who is there? who opened the door? The man received no answer, and the night was too dark for him to distinguish objects at any distance. He therefore returned, as I judged, into the house for a light. Meantime the dog, un∣derstanding the key in which these interrogations were uttered, began barking again more violently than ever. I had now no possibility of retreat, and I was not without hopes that I might yet ac∣complish my object, and clear the wall. Mean∣while a second man came out, while the other was getting his lanthorn, and, by that time, I had got to the top of the wall, was able to perceive me. He immediately set up a shout, and threw a large stone which grazed me in its flight. Alarmed at my situation, I was obliged to descend on the other side without taking the necessary precautions, and in my fall nearly dislocated my ancle.</P>
<P>There was a door in the wall, of which I was not previously apprised; and, this being opened, the two men with the lanthorn were on the other side in an instant. They had then nothing to do but to run along the lane to the place from which I
<PB N="52" REF="028752_0280_0FDBF2CC5722DDE8"/>
had descended. I endeavoured to ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e after my fall, but the pain was so intense that I was scarcely able to stand, and, after having limped a few paces, I twisted my foot under me, and fell down again. I had now no remedy, and quietly suffered myself to be retaken.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS conducted to the keeper's room for that night, and the two men sat up with me. I was accosted with many interrogatories, to which I gave little answer, but complained of the hurt in my leg. To this I could obtain no reply except, Curse you, my lad! if that be all, we will give you some ointment for that; we will anoint it with a little cold iron. They were indeed excessively <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulky with me, for having broken their night's rest and given them all this trouble. In the morning they were as good as their word, fixing a pair of fetters upon both my legs, regardless of the ancle which was now swelled to a considerable size, and then fastening me with a padlock to a staple in the floor of my dungeon. I expostulated with warmth upon this treatment, told them that I was a man upon whom the law had as yet passed no censure, and who therefore in the eye of the law was inno∣cent. But they bid me keep such fudge as that for people who knew no better; that they knew what they did, and would answer it to any court in Eng∣land.</P>
<P>The pain of the fetter was intolerable. I en∣deavoured in various ways to relieve it, and even privily to free my leg; but the more it was swelled, the more was this rendered impossible. I then resolved to bear it with patience; still the longer it continued, the worse it grew. After two days and two nights I entreated the turnkey to go and ask the surgeon who usually attended the prison
<PB N="54" REF="028752_0282_0FDBF23AD2190A98"/>
to look at it, for, if it continued longer as it was, I was convinced it would mortify. But he glared <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>lily at me, and said, Damn my blood! I should like to see that day. To die of a mortification is too good an end for such a rascal! At the time that he thus addressed me, the whole mass of my blood was already fevered by the anguish I had un∣dergone, my patience was wholly exhausted, and I was silly enough to be irritated beyond bearing by his impertinence and vulgarity. Look you, Mr. turnkey, said I, there is one thing that such fellows as you are set over us for, and another thing that you are not. You are to take care we do not es∣cape, but it is no part of your office to call us names and abuse us. If I were not chained down to my seat, you dare as well eat your fingers as use such language; and, take my word for it, you shall yet live to repent of your insolence.</P>
<P>While I thus spoke, the man stared at me with astonishment. He was so little accustomed to such retorts that at first he could scarcely believe his ears; and such was the firmness of my manner that he seemed to forget for a moment that I was not at large. But, as soon as he had time to recol∣lect himself, he did not deign even to be angry. His face relaxed into a smile of contempt, he snap∣ped his fingers at me, and, turning upon his heel, exclaimed, Well said, my cock, Crow away! Have a care you do not burst! and, as he shut the door upon me, mimicked the voice of the animal he mentioned.</P>
<P>This rejoinder brought me to myself in a mo∣ment, and showed me the impotence of the resent∣ment I was expressing. But, though he thus put an end to the violence of my speech, the torture of my body continued as great as ever. I was de∣termined to change my mode of attack. The same turnkey returned in a few minutes; and, as he ap∣proached
<PB N="55" REF="028752_0283_0FDBF28365FE5D38"/>
me to put down some food he had brought I slipped a shilling into his hand, saying at the same time, My good fellow, for God's sake, go to the surgeon: I am sure you do not wish me to perish for want of assistance. The fellow put the shilling in his pocket, looked hard at me, and then with one nod of his head, and without uttering a single word, went away. The surgeon presently after made his appearance; and, finding the part in a high state of inflammation, ordered certain appli∣cations, and gave peremptory directions that the fetter should not be replaced upon that leg, till a cure had been effected. It was a full month be∣fore the leg was perfectly healed, and made equally strong and flexible with the other.</P>
<P>The condition in which I was now placed was totally different from that which had preceded this attempt. I was chained all day in my dungeon, except that the door was regularly opened for a few hours, at which time some of the prisoners occasionally came and spoke to me, and particu∣larly one, who, though he could ill replace my be∣loved Brightwel, was innocent, guileless and bene∣volent. This was no other than the individual whom Mr. Falkland had some months before dis∣missed upon an accusation of murder. My manual labours were now at an end; my dungeon was searched every night, and every kind of tool care∣fully kept from me. The straw which has been hitherto allowed me was removed, under pretence that it was adapted for concealment; and the only conveniences with which I was indulged were a chair and a blanket.</P>
<P>A prospect of some alleviation in no long time opened upon me; but this my usual ill fortune rendered abortive. The keeper once more made his appearance, and with his former unconstituti∣onal and ambiguous humanity. He pretended to
<PB N="56" REF="028752_0284_0FDBF23F82A99C30"/>
be surprised at my want of every accommodation. He reprehended in strong terms my attempt to escape, and observed that there must be an end of civility from people in his situation, if gentlemen after all would not know when they were well. It was necessary in cases the like of this to let the law take its course, and it would be ridiculous i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> me to complain, if after a regular trial things should go hard with me. He was desirous of being in every respect my friend, if I would let him—In the midst of this circumlocution and preamble, he was called away from me for something relating to the business of his office. In the mean time I ruminated upon his overtures; and, detesting as I did the source from which I conceived them to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>low, I could not help reflecting how far it would be possible to extract from them the means of es∣cape. But my meditations in this case were vain. The keeper returned no more during the remainder of that day, and on the next an incident occurred which put an end to all expectations from his kindness.</P>
<P>An active mind, which has once been forced into any particular train, can scarcely be persuad∣ed to desert it as hopeless. I had studied my chains during the extreme anguish that I endured from the pressure of the fetter upon the ancle which had been sprained; and, though from the swelling and acute sensibility of the part I had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound all attempts at relief in that instance imprac∣ticable, I obtained from the closeness of my in∣vestigation another and apparently superior advan∣tage. During the night my dungeon was in a state of complete darkness; but, when the door was open, the case was somewhat different. The passage indeed into which it opened was so narrow, and the opposite dead wall so near, that it was but
<PB N="57" REF="028752_0285_0FDBF284524BFD90"/>
a glimmering and melancholy light that entered my apartment, even at full noon, and when the door was as its widest extent. But my eyes, after a practice of two or three weeks, accommodated themselves to this circumstance, and I learned to distinguish the minutest objects. One day, as I was alternately meditating and examining the ob∣jects around me, I chanced to observe a nail trod∣den into the mud floor at no great distance from me. I immediately conceived the desire of posses∣sing myself of this implement; but, for fear of surprise, people passing perpetually to and fro, I contented myself for the present with remarking its situation so accurately, that I might easily find it again in the dark. Accordingly, as soon as my door was shut, I seized upon this new treasure, and, having contrived to fashion it to my purpose, found that I could unlock with it the padlock that fastened me to the staple in the floor. This I re∣garded as no inconsiderable advantage, separately from the use I might derive from it in relation to my principal object. My chain permitted me to move only about eighteen inches to the right or left; and, having borne this confinement for seve∣ral weeks, my very heart leaped at the pitiful con∣solation of being able to range without constraint, the miserable coop in which I was immured. This incident had occurred several days previous to the last visit of my keeper.</P>
<P>From this time it had been my constant practice to liberate myself every night, and not to replace things in their former situation, till I awoke in the morning, and expected shortly to perceive the en∣trance of the turnkey. Security breeds negligence. It was on the morning succeeding my conference with the jailor that, whether I overslept myself, or the turnkey went his round earlier than usual, I
<PB N="58" REF="028752_0286_0FDBF2419196A3C8"/>
was roused from my sleep by the noise he made in opening the cell next to my own; and, though I exerted the utmost diligence, yet having to grope for my materials in the dark, I was unable to fasten the chain to the staple, before he entered as usual with his lanthorn. He was extremely surprised to find me thus disengaged, and immediately sum∣moned the principal keeper. I was questioned re∣specting my method of proceeding; and, as I be∣lieved concealment could lead to nothing but a severer search and a more accurate watch, I readily acquainted them with the exact truth. The illus∣trious personage whose function it was to controul the inhabitants of these walls, was by this last in∣stance completely exasperated against me. Arti∣fice and fair speaking were at an end. His eyes sparkling with fury, he exclaimed, that he was now convinced of the folly of showing kindness to rascals, the scum of the earth, such as I was; and, damn him, if any body should catch him at that again towards any one. I had cured him effec∣tually! He was astonished that the laws had not provided some terrible retaliation for thieves that attempted to deceive their jailors. Hanging was a thousand times too good for me!</P>
<P>Having vented his indignation, he proceeded to give such orders as the united instigations of anger and alarm suggested to his mind. My apartment was changed. I was conducted to a room called the strong room, the door of which opened into the middle cell of the range of dungeons. It was under-ground as they were, and had over it the day room for felons already described. It was spacious and dreary. The door had not been opened for years; the air was putrid; and the walls hung round with damps and mildew. The fetters, the padlock, and the staple were employed
<PB N="59" REF="028752_0287_0FDBF28B442A9AC8"/>
as in the former case, in addition to which they put on me a pair of hand-cuffs. For my first pro∣vision the keeper sent me nothing but a bit of bread, mouldy and black, and some dirty and stinking water. I know not indeed whether this is to be regarded as gratuitous tyranny on the part of the jailor; the law having providently directed in certain cases, that the water to be administered to the prisoners, shall be taken from "the next sink or puddle nearest to the jail."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">State Trials, Vol. I. anno 1615.</NOTE> It was far∣ther ordered that one of the turnkeys should sleep in the cell that formed a sort of antichamber to my apartment. Though every convenience was provided, to render this chamber fit for the recep∣tion of a personage, of a dignity so superior to the felon he was appointed to guard, he expressed much dissatisfaction at the mandate: but there was no alternative.</P>
<P>The situation to which I was thus removed was apparently the most undesirable that could be ima∣gined; but I was not discouraged. I had for some time learned not to judge by appearances. The apartment was dank and unwholesome; but I had acquired the secret of counteracting▪ these in∣fluences. My door was kept continually shut, and the other prisoners were debarred access to me. But, if the intercourse of our fellow men has its pleasures, solitude on the other hand is not with∣out its advantages▪ In solitude we can pursue our own thoughts undisturbed; and I was able to call up at will the most pleasing avocations. Beside which, to one who meditated such designs as now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illed my mind, solitude had peculiar recommen∣dations. I was scarcely left to myself before I tried an experiment the idea of which I conceived
<PB N="60" REF="028752_0288_0FDBF246D9625250"/>
while they were fixing my hand-cuffs; and, with my teeth only, disengaged myself from this re∣straint. The hours at which I was visited by the keepers were regular, and I took care to be pro∣vided for them. Add to which, I had a narrow grated window near the cieling, about nine inches in perpendicular, and a foot and a half in width, which, though small, admitted a much stronger light, than that to which I had been accustomed for several weeks. Thus circumstanced, I scarcely ever found myself in total darkness, and was better provided against surprises, than I had been in my preceding situation. Such were the sentiments which this change of abode immediately suggest∣ed.</P>
<P>I had been a very little time removed, when I received an unexpected visit from Thomas, Mr. Falk∣land's valet, whom I have already more than once mentioned in the course of my narrative. A servant of Mr. Forester happened to come to the town where I was imprisoned, a few weeks before, while I was confined with the hurt in my ancle, and had called in to see me. The account he gave of what he observed had been the source of many an uneasy sensation to Thomas. The former visit was a matter of mere curiosity, but Thomas was of the better order of servants. He was considerably struck at the sight of me. Though my mind was now serene, and my health sufficiently good, yet the floridness of my complexion was gone, and there was a rudeness in my physiognomy, the con∣sequence of hardship and fortitude, extremely un∣like the sleekness of my better days. Thomas looked alternately in my face, at my hands and my feet; and then fetched a deep sigh. After a pause:</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="028752_0289_0FDBF28C99AECC70"/>
Lord bless us! said he, in a voice in which com∣miseration was sufficiently perceptible, is this you?</P>
<P>Why not, Thomas? You knew I was sent to prison, did not you?</P>
<P>Prison! and must people in prison be shackled and bound of that fashion?—And where do you lay of nights?</P>
<P>Here.</P>
<P>Here! Why there is no bed!</P>
<P>No, Thomas, I am not allowed a bed. I had straw formerly, but that is taken away.</P>
<P>And do they take off them there things of nights?</P>
<P>No; I am expected to sleep just as you see.</P>
<P>Sleep! Why I thought this was a Christian country; but this usage is too bad for a dog.</P>
<P>You must not say so, Thomas. It is what the wisdom of government has thought fit to provide.</P>
<P>Zounds, how I have been choused! They told me what a fine thing it was to be an Englishman, and about liberty and property, and all that there; and I find it is all a flam. Lord, what fools we be! Things are done under our very noses, and we know nothing of the matter; and a parcel of fellows with grave faces swear to us that such things never happen but in France, and other coun∣tries the like of that. Why, you han't been tried, ha' you?</P>
<P>No.</P>
<P>And what signifies being tried, when they do worse than hang a man, and all beforehand? Well, master Williams, you have been very wicked to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure, and I thought it would have done me good to see you hanged. But, I do not know how it is, one's heart melts, and pity comes over one, if we take time to cool. I know that ought not to be; but, damn it, when I talked of your being hanged,
<PB N="62" REF="028752_0290_0FDBF24A92B9B380"/>
I did not think of your suffering all this into the bargain.</P>
<P>Soon after this conversation Thomas left me. The idea of the long connexion of our families rushed upon his memory, and he felt more for my sufferings at the moment than I did for myself. In the afternoon I was surprised to see him again. He said, that he could not get the thought of me out of his mind, and therefore he hoped I would not be displeased at his coming once more to take leave of me. I could perceive that he had some∣thing upon his mind, which he did not know how to discharge. One of the turnkeys had each time come into the room with him, and continued as long as he staid. Upon some avocation however, a noise I believe in the passage, the turnkey went as far as the door to satisfy his curiosity; and Tho∣mas, watching the opportunity, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>pt into my hand a chissel, a file, and a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aw, exclaiming at the same time with a sorrowful tone. I know I am doing wrong; but, if they hang me too▪ I cannot help it: I cannot do no other. For Christ's sake, get out of this place; I cannot bear the thoughts of it!—I received the implements with great joy, and thrust them into my bosom; and, as soon as he was gone, concealed them in the rushes of my chair. Meanwhile he had accomplished the object for which he came, and presently after bade me farewel.</P>
<P>The next day the keepers, I know not for what reason, were more than usually industrious in their search, saying, though without assigning any ground for their suspicion, that they were sure I had some tool in my possession that I ought not; but the de∣pository I had chosen escaped them.</P>
<P>I waited from this time the greater part of a week that I might have the benefit of a bright
<PB N="63" REF="028752_0291_0FDBF22A84B7E6A8"/>
moon light. It was necessary that I should work in the night; it was necessary that my operations should be performed between the last visit of the keepers at night and their first in the morning, that is, between nine in the evening and seven. In my dungeon, as I have already said, I passed fourteen or sixteen hours of the four and twenty undis∣turbed; but, since I had acquired a character for mechanical ingenuity, a particular exception with respect to me was made from the general rules of the prison.</P>
<P>It was ten o'clock when I entered on my under∣taking. The room in which I was confined was secured with a double door. This was totally su∣perfluous for the purpose of my detention, since there was a centinel planted on the outside. But it was very fortunate for my plan, because these doors prevented the easy communication of sound, and afforded me tolerable satisfaction that with a little care in my mode of proceeding I might be secure against the danger of being overheard. I first took off my hand-cuffs. I then filed through my fetters; and next performed the same service to three of the iron bars that secured my window, to which I climbed partly by the assistance of my chair and partly by means of certain irregularities in the wall. All this was the work of more than two hours. When the bars were filed through, I easily forced them a little from the perpendicular, and then drew them one by one out of the wall, into which they were sunk about three inches, per∣fectly strait, and without any precaution to prevent their being removed. But the space thus obtained was by no means wide enough to admit the passing of my body. I therefore applied myself partly with my chissel, and partly with one of the iron bars, to the loosening the brick work; and, when
<PB N="64" REF="028752_0292_0FDBF24C1328FFB0"/>
I had thus disengaged four or five bricks, I got down and piled them upon the floor. This opera∣tion I repeated three or four times. The space was now sufficient for my purpose, and having crept through the opening, I stepped upon a sort of shed on the outside.</P>
<P>I was now in a kind of rude area between two dead walls, that south of the felons day room the windows of which were at the east end, and the wall of the prison. But I had not, as formerly, any instruments to assist me in scaling the wall which was of a considerable height. There was of consequence no resource for me but that of ef∣fecting a practicable breach in the lower part of the wall, which was of no contemptible strength, being of stone on the outside, with a facing of brick within. The rooms for the debtors were at right angles with the building from which I had just escaped; and, as the night was extremely bright, I was in momentary danger, particularly in case of the least noise, of being discovered by them, several of their windows commanding the area. Thus circumstanced, I determined to make the shed answer the purpose of concealment. It was locked; but, with the broken link of my fet∣ters, which I had had the precaution to bring with me, I found no great difficulty in opening the lock. I had now got a sufficient means of hiding my person while I proceeded in my work, attended with no other disadvantage, than that of being obliged to leave the door through which I had thus broken, a little open for the sake of light. After some time I had removed a considerable part of the brick work of the outer wall; but, when I came to the stone, I found the undertaking infinitely more difficult. The mortar which bound together the building, was by length of time nearly petri∣fied,
<PB N="65" REF="028752_0293_0FDBF293516110F0"/>
and appeared to my first efforts one solid rock of the hardest adamant. I had now been six hours incessantly engaged in incredible labour; my chissel broke in the first attempt upon this new ob∣stacle, and between fatigue already endured, and the seemingly invincible difficulty before me, I concluded that I must remain where I was, and that all I had hitherto effected would prove useless. At the same time the moon, whose light had till now been of the greatest use to me, set, and I was left in total darkness.</P>
<P>After a respite of ten minutes however, I re∣turned to the attack with new vigour. I could not be less than two hours before the first stone was loosened from the edifice. In one hour more the space was sufficient to admit of my escape. The pile of bricks I had left in the strong room was considerable. But it was a mole hill compared with the ruins I had forced from the outer wall. I am fully assured that the work I had thus per∣formed would have been to a common labourer with every advantage of tools the business of two or three days.</P>
<P>But my difficulties, instead of being ended, seemed to be only begun. The day broke before I had completed the opening, and in ten minutes more the keepers would probably enter my apart∣ment, and perceive the devastation I had left. The lane, which connected the side of the prison through which I had escaped with the adjacent country, was formed chiefly by two dead walls, with here and there a stable, a few warehouses and some mean habitations tenanted by the lower order of people. My best security lay in clearing the town as soon as possible, and depending upon the open country for protection. My arms were intolerably swelled and bruised with my labour, and
<PB N="66" REF="028752_0294_0FDBF250F78F6B50"/>
my strength seemed wholly exhausted with fatigue. Speed I was nearly unable to exert for any conti∣nuance; and, if I could, with the enemy so close at my heels, speed would too probably have been useless It appeared as if I were now in almost the same situation, as that in which I had been placed five or six weeks before, in which after having completed my escape I was obliged to yield myself up without resistance to my pursuers. I was not however disabled as then; I was capable of exertion to what precise extent I could not as∣certain; and I was well aware that every instance in which I should fail of my purpose, would con∣tribute to enhance the difficulty of any future at∣tempt. Such were the con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iderations that present∣ed themselves in relation to my escape; and, even if that were effected, I had to reckon among my difficulties that, at the time I quitted my prison, I was destitute of every resource, and had not a shilling remaining in the world.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<P>I PASSED along the lane I had described without perceiving or being observed by a human being. The doors were shut, the window-shutters closed, and all was still as night. I reached the extremity of the lane unmolested. My pursuers, if they immediately followed, would know that the like∣lihood was small of my having in the interval found shelter in this place; and would proceed without hesitation, as I on my part was obliged to do, from the end nearest to the prison to its farthest termina∣tion.</P>
<P>The face of the country, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to which I had thus opened myself a passage, was rude and uncultivated. It was overgrown with brushwood and furze; the soil was for the most part of a loose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and; and the surface extremely irregular. I climbed a small eminence, and could perceive not very remote in the distance a few cottages thinly scattered. This prospect did not altogether please me; I conceived that my safety would for the pre∣sent be extremely benefited by keeping myself from the view of any human being.</P>
<P>I therefore came down again into the valley, and upon a careful examination perceived that it was interspersed with cavities, some deeper than others, but all of them so shallow as neither to be capable of hiding a man, nor of exciting suspicion as places of possible concealment. Meanwhile the day had but just begun to dawn; the morning was lowering and drizzly; and, though the depth of
<PB N="68" REF="028752_0296_0FDBF252106FEE78"/>
these caverns was of course well known to the neighbouring inhabitants, the shadows they cast were so black and impenetrable as might well have produced wider expectations in the mind of a stranger. Poor therefore as was the protection they were able to afford, I thought it right to have recourse to it for the moment as the best the emer∣gency would supply. It was for my life; and, the greater was the jeopardy to which it was exposed, the more dear did that life seem to become to my affections. The recess I chose as most secure was within little more than a hundred yards of the end of the lane and the extreme buildings of the town.</P>
<P>I had not stood up in this manner two minutes, before I heard the sound of feet, and presently saw the ordinary turnkey and another pass by the place of my retreat. They were so close to me that, if I had stretched out my hand, I believe I could have caught hold of their clothes without so much as changing my posture. As no part of the over∣hanging earth intervened between me and them, I could see them entire, though the deepness of the shade rendered me almost completely invisible. I heard them say to each other, in tones of vehe∣ment asperity, Curse the rascal! which way can he be gone? Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> reply was, Damn him! I wish we had him but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate once again! Never fear! re∣joined the first, he cannot have above half a mile the start of us They were presently out of hear∣ing; for, as to sight, I dared not advance my body so much as an inch to look after them, lest I should be discovered by my pursuers in some other di∣rection. From the very short time that elapsed between my escape and the appearance of these men, I concluded that they had made their way through the same outlet as I had done, it being impossible that they could have had time to come
<PB N="69" REF="028752_0297_0FDBF29B90137A80"/>
from the gate of the prison and so round a consi∣derable part of the town, as they must otherwise have done.</P>
<P>I was so alarmed at this instance of diligence on the part of the enemy, that for some time I scarce∣ly ventured to proceed an inch from my place of concealment, or almost to change my posture. The morning, which had been bleak and drizzly, was succeeded by a day of heavy and incessant rain: and the gloomy state of the air and surrounding objects, together with the extreme nearness of my prison, and a total want of food, caused me to pass the hours in no very agreeable sensations. This inclemency of the weather however, which generated a feeling of stillness and solitude, en∣couraged me by degrees to change my retreat, for another of the same nature, but of somewhat greater security. I hovered with little variation about a single spot as long as the sun continued above the horizon.</P>
<P>Towards evening the clouds began to disperse, and the moon shone, as on the preceding night, in full brightness. I had perceived no human creature during the whole day, except in the in∣stance already mentioned. This had perhaps been owing to the nature of the day; at all events I considered it as too hazardous an experiment to venture from my hiding-place in so clear and fine a night. I was therefore obliged to wait for the setting of this luminary, which was not till near five o'clock in the morning. My only relief during this interval was to allow myself to sink to the bot∣tom of my cavern, it being scarcely possible for me to continue any longer on my feet. Here I fell into an interrupted and unrefreshing doze, the consequence of a laborious night and a tedious, melancholy day; though I rather sought to avoid
<PB N="70" REF="028752_0298_0FDBF25392D5A7C0"/>
sleep, which, co-operating with the coldness of the season, would tend more to injury than ad∣vantage.</P>
<P>The period of darkness which I had determined to use for the purpose of removing to a greater distance from my prison was in its whole duration something less than three hours. When I rose from my seat, I was weak with hunger and fatigue, and, which was worse, I seemed between the dampness of the preceding day, and the sharp, clear frost of the night, to have lost the command of my limbs. I stood up and shook myself; I leaned against the side of the hill, impelling in dif∣ferent directions the muscles of the extremities; and at length recovered in some degree the sense of feeling. This operation was attended with an incredible aching pain, and required no common share of resolution to encounter and prosecute it. Having quitted my retreat, I at first advanced with weak and tottering steps; but, as I proceeded, increased my pace. The barren heath which reached to the edge of the town was at least on this side without a path; but the stars shone, and guiding myself by them I determined to steer as far as possible from the hateful scene where I had been so long confined. The line I pursued was of irregular surface, sometimes obliging me to climb a steep ascent, and at others to go down into a dark and impenetrable dell. I was often compelled by the dangerousness of the way to deviate consider∣ably from the direction I wished to pursue. In the mean time I advanced with as much rapidity, as these and similar obstacles would permit me to do. The swiftness of the motion and the thinness of the air restored to me my alacrity. I forgot the inconveniences under which I laboured, and my mind became lively, spirited and enthusiastic.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="028752_0299_0FDBF29D2ED58080"/>
I had now reached the border of the heath and entered upon what is usually termed the forest. Strange as it may seem, it is nevertheless true, that, exhausted as I was with hunger, destitute of all provision for the future, and surrounded with the most alarming dangers, my mind suddenly became glowing, animated and chearful. I thought that by this time the most formidable difficulties of my undertaking were surmounted; and I could not believe that, after having effected so much, I should find any thing invincible in what remained to be done. I recollected the confinement I had under∣gone and the fate that had impended over me with horror. Never did man feel more vividly than I felt at that moment the sweets of liberty. Never did man more strenuously prefer poverty with in∣dependence to the artificial allurements of a life of slavery. I stretched forth my arms with rapture, I clapped my hands one upon the other, and ex∣claimed, Ah, this is indeed to be a man! These wrists were lately galled with fetters; all my mo∣tions, whether I rose up or sat down, were echoed to with the clanking of chains; I was tied down like a wild beast, and could not move but in a cir∣cle of a few feet in circumference. Now I can run, fleet as a greyhound; and leap like a young roe upon the mountains. Oh, God! (if God there be, that condescends to record the lonely beatings of an anxious heart) thou only canst tell with what delight a prisoner, just broke forth from his dun∣geon, hugs the blessings of new-found liberty! Sa∣cred and indescribable moment, when man regains his rights! But lately I held my life in jeopardy, because one man was unprincipled enough to assert what he knew to be false; I was destined to suffer an early and inexorable death from the hands of others, because none of them had penetration
<PB N="72" REF="028752_0300_0FDBF25803473BC0"/>
enough to distinguish from falshood what I uttered with the entire conviction of a full-fraught heart! Strange, that men from age of age should consent to hold their lives at the breath of another, merely that each in his turn may have a power of acting the tyrant according to law! Oh, God! give me poverty! shower upon me all the imaginary hard∣ships of human life! I will receive them all with thankfulness. Turn me a prey to the wild beasts of the desert, so I be never again the victim of man dressed in the gore-dripping robes of autho∣rity! Suffer me at least to call life and the pur∣suits of life my own! Let me hold it at the mercy of elements, of the hunger of beasts or the revenge of barbarians, but not of the cold-blooded pru∣dence of monopolists and kings!—How enviable was the enthusiasm which could thus furnish me with energy, in the midst of hunger, poverty and universal desertion!</P>
<P>I had now walked at least six miles. At first I carefully avoided the habitations that lay in my way, and feared to be seen by any of the persons to whom they belonged, lest it should in any de∣gree furnish a clue to the researches of my pur∣suers. As I went forward, I conceived it might be proper to relax a part of my precaution. At this time I perceived several persons coming out of a thicket close to me. I immediately considered this circumstance as rather favourable than the contrary. It was necessary for me to avoid enter∣ing any of the towns and villages in the vicinity. At the same time it was full time that I should pro∣cure for myself some species of refreshment; and it was by no means improbable that these men might be in some way assisting to me in that re∣spect. In my situation it appeared to me indif∣ferent what might be their employment or pro∣fession.
<PB N="73" REF="028752_0301_0FDBF2A21C8E7490"/>
I had little to apprehend from thieves, and I believed that they, as well as honest men, could not fail to have some compassion for a person under my circumstances. I therefore rather threw myself in their way than avoided them.</P>
<P>They were thieves. One of the company cried out, Who goes there? stand! I accosted them. Gentlemen, said I, I am a poor traveller, almost—While I spoke, they came round me, and he that had first hailed me said, Damn me, tip us none of your palaver; we have heard that story of a poor traveller any time these five years. Come, down with your dust! let us see what you have got! Sir, I replied, I have not a shilling in the world, and am more than half-starved beside. Not a shil∣ling! answered my assailant, what, I suppose you are as poor as a thief? But, if you have not money, you have clothes, and those you must resign.</P>
<P>My clothes! rejoined I with indignation; you cannot desire such a thing. Is it not enough that I am pennyless? I have been all night upon the open heath. It is now the second day that I have not eaten a morsel of bread. Would you strip me naked to the weather in the midst of this depopu∣lated forest? No, no, you are men! The same hatred of oppression that arms you against the in∣solence of wealth, will teach you to relieve those who are perishing like me. For God's sake, give me food! do not strip me of the benefits I still possess!</P>
<P>While I uttered this apostrophe, the unpreme∣ditated eloquence of sentiment, I could perceive by their gestures, though the day had not yet be∣gun to dawn, that the feelings of one or two of the company appeared to take my part. The man, who had already undertaken to be their spokesman,
<PB N="74" REF="028752_0302_0FDBF258D099F060"/>
perceived the same thing; and, excited either by the brutality of his temper or the love of com∣mand, hastened to anticipate the disgrace of a de∣feat. He brushed suddenly up to me, and by main force pushed me several feet from the place where I stood. The shock I received drove me upon a second of the gang, not one of those who had listened to my expostulation; and he repeated the same brutality. My indignation was strongly ex∣cited by this treatment; and, after being thrust backward and forward two or three times in this manner, I broke through my assailants, and turned round to defend myself. The first that advanced within my reach was my original enemy. In the present moment I listened to nothing but the dic∣tates of passion, and I laid him at his length on the earth. I was immediately assailed with sticks and bludgeons on all sides, and presently received a blow that almost deprived me of my senses. The man I had knocked down was now upon his feet again, and aimed a stroke at me with a cutlass as I fell, which took place in a deep wound upon my neck and shoulder. He was going to repeat his blow. The two who had seemed to waver at first in their animosity, afterwards appeared to me to join in the attack, urged either by animal sym∣pathy or the spirit of imitation. One of them however, as I afterwards understood, seized the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rm of the man who was going to strike me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> second time with his cutlass, and who would other∣wise probably have put an end to my existence. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> could hear the words, Damn it, enough, enough <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that is too bad, Jones! How so? replied a second voice; he will but pine here upon the forest, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by inches: it is an act of charity in this case <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> put him out of his pain.—It will be imagined that I was not uninterested in this sort of debate. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="75" REF="028752_0303_0FDBF2A490D54BB0"/>
made an effort to speak; my voice failed me. I stretched out one hand with a gesture of intreaty. You shall not strike, by G—! said one of the voices; why should we be murderers?—The side of forbearance at length prevailed. They there∣fore contented themselves with stripping me of my coat and waistcoat, and rolling me into a dry ditch. They then left me, totally regardless of my dis∣tressed condition, and the plentiful effusion of blood which streamed from my wound.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<P>IN this woful situation, though extremely weak, I was not deprived of sense. I tore my shirt from my naked body, and with it endeavoured with some success to make a bandage to stanch the flow∣ing of the blood. I then exerted myself to crawl up the side of the ditch. I had scarcely effected the latter, when with equal surprise and joy I per∣ceived a man advancing at no great distance. I called for help as well as I could. The man came towards me with evident signs of compassion, and the figure I exhibited was indeed sufficiently calcu∣lated to excite it. I had no hat. My hair was disheveled, and the ends of the locks clotted with blood. My shirt was wrapped about my neck and shoulder, and was plentifully stained with red. My body which was naked to my middle was variegated with streams of blood, nor had my breeches which were of leather by any means es∣caped.</P>
<P>For God's sake, my poor fellow! said he, with a tone of the greatest imaginable kindness, how came you thus? And, saying this, he lifted me up, and set me on my feet. Can you stand? added he doubtfully. Oh, yes, very well, I replied. Having received this answer, he quitted me, and began to take off his own coat, that he might cover me from the cold. I had however overrated my strength, and was no sooner left to myself, than I reeled, and fell almost at my length upon the
<PB N="77" REF="028752_0305_0FDBF2A654BD5B50"/>
ground. But I broke my fall by stretching out my sound arm, and again raised myself upon my knees. My benefactor now covered me, raised me, and bidding me lean upon him, told me he would pre∣sently conduct me to a place where I should be taken care of. Courage is a capricious property; and, though while I had no one to depend upon but myself, I possessed a mine of seemingly inex∣haustible fortitude, yet no sooner did I find this unexpected sympathy on the part of another, than my resolution appeared to give way, and I felt my∣self ready to saint. My charitable conductor per∣ceived this, and he every now and then encouraged me in a manner so chearful, so good humoured and benevolent, equally free from the harshness of rebuke and the weakness of indulgence, that I thought myself under the conduct of an angel ra∣ther than a man. I could perceive that his beha∣viour had in it nothing of boorish rudeness, and that he was thoroughly imbued with the principles of affectionate civility.</P>
<P>We walked about three quarters of a mile, and that not towards the open, but the most uncouth and unfrequented part of the forest. We crossed a place which had once been a moat, but which was now in some parts dry and in others contained a little muddy and stagnated water. Within the inclosure of this moat, and among the still visible foundations of a larger, ancient building, was a cottage, or rather two or three cottages irregularly thrown together, not different from the habitations of the peasantry in general, except that they were constructed for the most part of materials supplied from this ancient ruin.</P>
<P>My conductor knocked at the door, and was an∣swered by a voice from within, which for body and force might have been the voice of a man, but
<PB N="78" REF="028752_0306_0FDBF25F925E1660"/>
which had a sort of female sharpness and acidity, with the enquiry, Who is there? Satisfaction was no sooner given in this point, than I heard two bolts pushed back and the door unlocked. The apartment opened, and we entered. The interior of the building by no means corresponded with the appearance of my protector, but on the contrary wore a face of discomfort, carelessness and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. The only person I saw within was a woman, ra∣ther advanced in life, and whose appearance had I know not what of extraordinary and loathsome. Her eyes were red and blood-shot; her hair was pendent in matted and shaggy tresses about her shoulders; her complexion swarthy, and of the consistency of parchment; her form spare, and her whole body, her arms in particular, uncommonly vigorous and muscular. Not the milk of human kindness, but the feverous blood of savage ferocity seemed to flow from her heart; and her whole figure suggested an idea of unmitigable energy and an appetite gorged in malevolence. This infernal Thalestris had no sooner cast her eyes upon us as we entered, than she exclaimed in a discordant and discontented voice, What have we got here? this is not one of our people! My conductor, without answering this apostrophe, bid her push an easy chair which stood in one corner, and set it directly before the fire. This she did with ap∣parent reluctance, muttering, Ah, you are at your old tricks; I wonder what such folks as we have to do with charity! It will be the ruin of us at last, I can see that! Hold your tongue, beldam! said he, with a stern significance of manner, and fetch one of my best shirts, a waistcoat and some dressings. Saying this, he at the same time put into her hand a small bunch of keys. In a word, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e treated me with as much kindness as if he had
<PB N="79" REF="028752_0307_0FDBF2AC2E6FD528"/>
been my father. He examined my wound, wash∣ed and dressed it; at the same time that the old woman by his express order prepared for me such nourishment as he thought most suitable to my weak and languid condition.</P>
<P>These operations were no sooner completed, than my benefactor recommended to me to retire to rest, and preparations were making for that pur∣pose, when suddenly a trampling of feet was heard, succeeded by a knock at the door. The old woman opened the door with the same precautions as had been employed upon our arrival, and immediately six or seven persons tumultuously entered the apart∣ment. Their appearance was different, some hav∣ing the air of mere rustics, and others that of a tarnished sort of gentry. All had a feature of boldness, inquietude and disorder, extremely un∣like any thing I had before observed in such a groupe. But my astonishment was still increased, when upon a second glance I perceived something in the general air of several of them, and of one in particular, that persuaded me they were the gang from which I had just escaped, and this one the antagonist by whose animosity I was so near to the having been finally destroyed. I instantly ima∣gined they had entered our hovel with a hostile intention, that my benefactor was upon the point of being robbed, and I probably murdered.</P>
<P>This suspicion however was soon removed. They addressed my conductor with respect under the appellation of captain. They were boisterous and noisy in their remarks and exclamations, but their turbulence was tempered by a certain defe∣rence to his opinion and authority. I could ob∣serve in the person who had been my active oppo∣nent some aukwardness and irresolution as he first perceived me, which he dismissed with a sort of
<PB N="80" REF="028752_0308_0FDBF2610F929E38"/>
effort, exclaiming, Who the devil is here? There was something in the tone of this apostrophe that roused the attention of my protector. He looked at the speaker with a fixed and penetrating glance, and then said, Nay, Jones, do you know? Did you ever see the person before? Curse it, Jones! interrupted a third, you are damnably out of luck. They say dead men walk, and you see there is some truth in it. Truce with your impertinence, Bar∣ton! replied my protector, this is no proper occa∣sion for a joke. Answer me, Jones, were you the cause of this young man being left naked and wounded this bitter morning upon the forest?</P>
<P>Mayhap I was. What then?</P>
<P>What provocation could induce you to so cruel a treatment?</P>
<P>Provocation enough. He had no money.</P>
<P>What, did you use him thus without so much as being irritated by any resistance on his part?</P>
<P>Yes, he did resist. I only hustled him, and he had the impudence to strike me.</P>
<P>Jones! you are an incorrigible fellow.</P>
<P>Pooh, what signifies what I am? You with your compassion and your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine feelings will bring us all to the gallows.</P>
<P>I have nothing to say to you; I have no hopes of you! Comrades, it is for you to decide upon the conduct of this man as you think proper. You know how repeated his offences have been; you know what pains I have taken to mend him. Our profession is the profession of justice. [It is thus that the prejudices of men universally teach them to colour the most desperate cause, to which they have determined to adhere.] We undertake to counteract the partiality and iniquity of public in∣stitutions. We, who are thieves without a licence, are at open war with another set of men, who are
<PB N="81" REF="028752_0309_0FDBF2AD90927E20"/>
thieves according to law. If any one disapprove our proceedings, at least we have this to say for ourselves, we act not by choice, but only as our wise governors force us to act. If any one disap∣prove our proceedings, they have this apology in their favour, we risk our lives when we adopt them, and stake our all upon their goodness and cogency. Time will one day decide whether we or our op∣pressors be the genuine patriots: for the present we are censured, only because they are the stronger party. With such a cause then to bear us out, shall we stain it with cruelty, malice and revenge? For my own part I glory in the name of a thief; and am firmly persuaded there is not a more gal∣lant and honourable profession upon the face of the earth, so long as it is exercised with a generous heart.—A thief is of course a man living among his equals; I do not pretend therefore to assume any authority among you; act as you think pro∣per; but so far as relates to myself▪ I vote that Jones be expelled from among us as a disgrace to our society.</P>
<P>This proposition seemed to meet the general sense. It was easy to perceive that the opinion of the rest coincided with that of their leader; not∣withstanding which a few of them hesitated as to the conduct to be pursued. In the mean time Jones muttered something in a surly and irresolute way about taking care how they provoked him. This insinuation instantly roused the courage of my protector, and his eyes flashed with contempt.</P>
<P>Rascal! said he, do you menace us? Do you think we will be your slaves? No, no, do your worst! Go to the next justice of the peace and impeach us▪ I can easily believe you are capable of it. Sir, when we entered into this gang, we were not such fools as not to know
<PB N="82" REF="028752_0310_0FDBF2660922A750"/>
that we entered upon a service of danger. One of its dangers consists in the treachery of fellows like you. But we did not enter at first, to flinch now. Did you believe that we would live in hourly fear of you, tremble at your threats, and compromise, whenever you should so please, with your insolence? That would be a blessed life in∣deed! I would rather see my flesh torn piecemeal from my bones! Go, sir! I defy you! You dare not do it! You dare not sacrifice all these gallant fellows to your rage, and publish yourself to all the world a traitor and a scoundrel! If you do, you will punish yourself, not us! Begone!</P>
<P>The intrepidity of the leader communicated it∣self to the rest of the company. Jones easily saw that there was no hope of bringing them over to a contrary sentiment. After a short pause, he an∣swered, I did not mean—No, damn it! I will not snivel neither. I was always true to my princi∣ples, and a friend to you all. But, since you are resolved to turn me out, why—good bye to you!</P>
<P>The expulsion of this man produced a remark∣able improvement in the whole gang. Those who were before inclined to humanity, assumed new energy in proportion as they saw such sentiments likely to prevail. They had before suffered them∣selves to be overborne by the boisterous insolence of their antagonists; but now they adopted and with success a different conduct. Those who en∣vied the ascendancy of their comrade, and there∣fore imitated his conduct, began to hesitate in their career. Stories were brought forward of the cru∣elty and brutality of Jones, both to men and animals, which had never before reached the ear of the leader. These stories I shall not repeat. They could ex∣cite only emotions of abhorrence and disgust, and
<PB N="83" REF="028752_0311_0FDBF2B355675EC0"/>
some of them argued a mind of such a stretch of depravity as to many readers would appear utterly incredible. And yet this man had his virtues. He was enterprising, persevering and faithful.</P>
<P>His removal was a considerable benefit to me. It would have been no small hardship to have been turned adrift immediately under my unfavourable circumstances, with the additional disadvantage of the wound I had received; and yet I could scarcely have ventured to remain under the same roof with a man to whom my appearance was as a guilty con∣science, perpetually reminding him of his own offence and the counteraction of his leader. His profession accustomed him to a certain degree of indifference to consequences, and indulgence to the sallies of passion; and he might easily have found his opportunity to insult or injure me, when I should have had nothing but my own debilitated exertions to protect me.</P>
<P>Freed from this danger, I found my situation sufficiently fortunate for a man under my circum∣stances. It was attended with all the advantages for concealment my fondest imagination could have hoped; and it was by no means destitute of the benefits which arise from kindness and humanity. Nothing could be more unlike than the thieves I had seen in—gaol, and the thieves of my new residence. The latter were generally full of chear∣fulness and merriment. They could expatiate freely wherever they thought proper. They could form plans and execute them. They consulted their own inclinations. They did not impose upon themselves the task, as is too often the case in hu∣man society, of seeming tacitly to approve that from which they suffered most; or, which is worse, of persuading themselves that all the wrongs they suffered were right; but were at open war
<PB N="84" REF="028752_0312_0FDBF267196BB0C0"/>
with their oppressors. On the contrary the im∣prisoned felons I had lately seen were shut up like wild beasts in a cage, deprived of activity, and palsied with indolence. The occasional demonstra∣tions that still remained of their former enter∣prising life, were the starts and convulsions of dis∣ease, not the meditated and consistent exertions of a mind in health. They had no more of hope, of project, of golden and animated dreams, but were reserved to the most dismal prospects, and for∣bidden to think upon any other topic. It is true that these two scenes were parts of one whole, the one the consummation, the hourly to be expected successor of the other. But the men I now saw were wholly inattentive to this, and in that respect appeared to have no intercourse with reflection or reason.</P>
<P>I might in one view, as I have said, congratulate myself upon my present residence; it answered completely the purposes of concealment. It was the seat of merriment and hilarity; but the hila∣rity that characterised it, produced no correspon∣dent feelings in my bosom. The persons who composed this society, had each of them cast off all controul from established principle; their trade was terror, and their constant object to elude the vigilance of the community. The influence of these circumstances was visible in their character. I found among them benevolence and kindness; they were strongly susceptible of emotions of ge∣nerosity. But, as their situation was precarious, their dispositions were proportionably fluctuating. Inured to the animosity of their species, they were irritable and passionate. Accustomed to exercise harshness towards the subject of their depredations, they did not always confine their brutality within that scope. They were habituated to consider
<PB N="85" REF="028752_0313_0FDBF2B450BFD398"/>
wounds, and bludgeons and stabbing, as the obvi∣ous mode of surmounting every difficulty. Unin∣volved in the debilitating routine of human affairs, they frequently displayed an energy, which from every impartial observer would have extorted vene∣ration. Energy is perhaps of all qualities the most invaluable; and a just political system would possess the means of extracting from it thus circumstanced its beneficial qualities, instead of consigning it as now to unlimited destruction. We act like the chymist who should reject the finest ore, and em∣ploy none but what was sufficiently debased to fit it immediately for the vilest uses. But the energy of these men, such as I beheld it, was in the highest degree misapplied, unassisted by any liberal and enlightened views, and directed only to the most narrow and contemptible purposes.</P>
<P>The residence I have been describing might to many persons have appeared attended with into∣lerable inconveniences. But, exclusively of its advantages as a field for speculation, it was Elysium compared with that from which I had just escaped. Displeasing company, incommodious apartments, filthiness and riot, lost the circumstance by which they could most effectually disgust, when I was not compelled to remain with them. All hardships I could patiently endure, in comparison with the menace of a violent and untimely death. There was no suffering that I could not persuade myself to consider as trivial, except that which flowed from the tyranny, the frigid precaution, or the inhuman revenge of my own species.</P>
<P>My recovery advanced in the most favourable manner. The attention and kindness of my pro∣tector were incessant, and the rest caught the spirit from his example. The old woman who superin∣tended the houshold, still retained her animosity.
<PB N="86" REF="028752_0314_0FDBF26D1673C998"/>
She considered me as the cause of the expulsion of Jones from the fraternity; Jones had been the object of her particular partiality; and, zealous as she was for the public concern, she thought an old and experienced sinner for a raw probationer but an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill exchange. Add to which, that her habits inclined her to moroseness and discontent, and that persons of her complexion seem unable to exist without some object upon which to employ the su∣perfluity of their gall. She lost no opportunity upon the most trifling occasion of displaying her animosity, and ever and anon eyed me with a fu∣rious glance of canine hunger for my destruction. Nothing was more evidently mortifying to her than the procrastination of her malice; nor could she bear to think that a fierceness so gigantic and un∣controulable should show itself in nothing more terrific than the pigmy spite of a chamber-maid. For myself, I had been accustomed to the warfare of formidable adversaries and the encounter of alarming dangers; and what I saw of her spleen had not power sufficient to disturb my tranquillity.</P>
<P>As I recovered, I told my story, except so far as related to the detection of Mr. Falkland's eventful secret, to my protector. That particular I could not as yet prevail upon myself to disclose even in a situation like this, which seemed to preclude the possibility of its being made use of to the disad∣vantage of my persecutor. My present auditor however, whose habits of thinking were extremely opposite to those of Mr. Forester, did not from the obscurity which flowed from this reserve, deduce any unfavourable conclusion. His penetration was such as to afford little room for an impostor to hope to mislead him by a fictitious statement, and he confided in that penetration. So confiding, the simplicity and integrity of my manner carried con∣viction
<PB N="87" REF="028752_0315_0FDBF2BA1150DC80"/>
to his mind, and insured his good opinion and friendship.</P>
<P>He listened to my story with eagerness, and com∣mented on the several parts as I related them. He said that this was only one fresh instance of the tyranny and perfidiousness exercised by the power∣ful members of the community against those who were less privileged than themselves. Nothing could be more clear than their readiness to sacrifice the human species at large to their meanest interest or wildest caprice. Who that saw the situation in its true light would wait till their oppressors thought sit to decree their destruction, and not take arms in their defence while it was yet in their power? Which was most meritorious, the unre∣sisting and dastardly submission of a slave, or the enterprise and gallantry of the man who dared to assert his claims? Since by the partial administra∣tion of our laws innocence, when power was armed against it, had nothing better to hope for than guilt, what man of true courage would fail to set these laws at defiance, and, if he must suffer by their injustice, at least take care that he had first shown his contempt of their yoke? For him∣self he should certainly never have embraced his present calling, had he not been stimulated to it by these cogent and irresistible reasons; and he hoped, as experience had so forcibly brought a conviction of this sort to my mind, that he should for the fu∣ture have the happiness to associate me to his pur∣suits.—It will presently be seen how far these hopes were confirmed by the event.</P>
<P>Numerous were the precautions exercised by the gang of thieves with whom I now resided to elude the vigilance of the satellites of justice. It was one of their rules to commit no depredations but at a considerable distance from the place of their
<PB N="88" REF="028752_0316_0FDBF26E8FBF6328"/>
residence, and Jones had transgressed this regula∣tion, in the attack to which I was indebted for my present asylum. After having possessed themselves of any booty, they took care in the sight of the persons whom they had robbed to pursue a route as nearly as possible opposite to that which led to their true haunts. The appearance of their place of residence, together with its environs was pecu∣liarly desolate and forlorn, and it had the reputa∣tion of being haunted. The old woman I have described had long been its inhabitant, and was commonly supposed to be its only inhabitant; and her person well accorded with the rural ideas of a witch. Her lodgers never went out or came in but with the utmost circumspection, and generally by night. The lights which were occasionally seen from various parts of her habitation were by the country people regarded with horror as superna∣tural; and, if the noise of revelry at any time sa∣luted their ears, it was imagined to proceed from a carnival of devils. With all these advantages the thieves did not venture to reside here but by intervals: sometimes they absented themselves for months, and resided in a different part of the coun∣try. The old woman sometimes attended them in these transportations, and sometimes remained; but in all cases her removal took place either sooner or later than theirs, so that the nicest observer could scarcely have traced any connection between her re-appearances and the alarms of depredation that were frequently given; and the festival of demons seemed to the terrified rustics indifferently to take place whether she were present or absent.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>ONE day, while I continued in this situation, a circumstance occurred, which involuntarily at∣tracted my attention. Two of our people had been sent to a town at some distance for the purpose of procuring us some things of which we were in want. After having delivered these to our land∣lady, they retired to one corner of the room, and, one of them pulling a printed paper from his pocket, they mutually occupied themselves in ex∣amining its contents. I was sitting in an easy chair by the fire, being considerably better than I had been, though still in a weak and languid state. Having read for a considerable time, they looked at me, and then at the paper, and then at me again. They then went out of the room together, as if to consult without interruption upon some∣thing which that paper suggested to them. Some time after they returned, and my protector, who happened to be above stairs, entered the room at the same instant.</P>
<P>Captain! said one of them with an air of plea∣sure, look here! we have found a prize! I believe it is as good as a bank note of a hundred guineas.</P>
<P>Mr. Raymond (that was his name) took the paper and read. He paused for a moment. He then crushed the paper in his hand; and, turning to the person from whom he had received it, said with the tone of a man confident in the success of his reasons,</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="028752_0318_0FDBF273020A2FB0"/>
What use have you for these hundred guineas? Are you in want? Are you in distress? Can you be contented to purchase them at the price of trea∣chery? of violating the laws of hospitality?</P>
<P>Faith, captain, I do not very well know. Af∣ter having violated other laws, I do not see why we should be frightened at an old saw. We pre∣tend to judge for ourselves, and ought to be above shrinking from a bugbear of a proverb. Beside, this is a good deed, and I should think no more harm of being the ruin of such a thief, than of getting my dinner.</P>
<P>A thief! You talk of thieves!—</P>
<P>Not so fast, if you please. God defend that I should say a word against thieving as a general occu∣pation! But one man steals in one way, and another in another. For my part, I go upon the highway, and take from any stranger I meet what it is a hun∣dred to one he can very well spare. I see nothing to be found fault with in that. But I have as much conscience as another man. Because I laugh at assizes and great wigs and the gallows, and because I will not be frightened from an innocent action when the lawyers say me nay, does it follow that I am to have a fellow-feeling for pilferers, and ras∣cally servants, and people that have neither justice nor principle? No: I have too much respect for the trade, not to be a foe to interlopers and people that so much the more deserve my hatred because the world calls them by my name.</P>
<P>You are wrong, Wilson! You certainly ought not to employ against people that you hate, sup∣posing your hatred to be reasonable, the instru∣mentality of that law which in your practice you defy. Be consistent. Either be the friend of law, or its adversary. Depend upon it that, wherever there are laws at all, there will be laws against
<PB N="91" REF="028752_0319_0FDBF2C0ABABC388"/>
such people as you and I. Either therefore we all of us deserve the vengeance of the law, or law is not the proper instrument of correcting the misdeeds of mankind. I tell you this, because I would fain have you aware that an informer or a king's evidence, a man who takes advantage of the confidence of another in order to betray him, who sells the life of his neighbour for money, or coward like, upon any pretence calls in the law to do that for him which he cannot or dares not do for himself, is the vilest of rascals. But in the present case, if your reasons were the best in the world, they do not apply.</P>
<P>While Mr. Raymond was speaking, the rest of the gang came into the room. He immediately turned to them and said,</P>
<P>My friends, here is a piece of intelligence that Wilson has just brought in, which with his leave I will lay before you.</P>
<P>Then, pulling the paper from his pocket, he continued: This is the description of a felon with the offer of a hundred guineas for his apprehen∣sion. Wilson picked it up at—. By the time and other circumstances, but particularly by the minute description of his person, there can be no doubt out the object of it is our young friend, whose life <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was a little while ago the instrument of saving. He is charged here with having taken advantage of the confidence of his patron and be∣nefactor, to rob him of property to a large amount. Upon this charge he was committed to the coun∣ty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail, from whence he made his escape about a fortnight ago without venturing to stand his trial, a circumstance which is stated by the advertiser <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> tantamount to a confession of his guilt.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> friends, I was acquainted with the particu∣lars of this story some time before. This lad let
<PB N="92" REF="028752_0320_0FDBF273D61A62E0"/>
me into his history at a time that he could not possibly have foreseen that he should stand in need of that precaution as an antidote against danger. He is not guilty of what is laid to his charge. Which of you is so ignorant as to suppose that his escape is any confirmation of his guilt? Who ever thinks, when he is apprehended for trial, of his innocence or guilt as being at all material to the issue? Who ever was fool enough to volunteer a trial, where those who are to decide think more of the horror of the thing of which he is accused than whether he was the person that did it; and where the nature of our motives is to be collected from a set of ignorant witnesses that no wise man would trust for a fair representation of the most indifferent action of his life?</P>
<P>The poor lad's story is a long one, and I will not trouble you with it now. But from that story it is as clear as the day, that, because he wished to leave the service of his master, because he had been perhaps a little too inquisitive in his master's concerns, and because, as I suspect, he had been trusted with some important secrets, his master conceived an antipathy against him. This antipa∣thy gradually proceeded to such a length, as to in∣duce the master to forge this vile accusation. He seems willing to hang the lad out of the way, ra∣ther than suffer him to go where he pleases or get beyond the reach of his power. Williams has told me the story with such ingenuousness that I am as sure that he is guiltless of what they lay to his charge as that I am so myself. Neverthe∣less the man's servants who were called in to hear the accusation, and his relation, who as justice of the peace made out the mittimus, and who had the folly to think he could be impartial, gave it on his side with one voice, and thus afforded
<PB N="93" REF="028752_0321_0FDBF29205CA0288"/>
Williams a sample of what he had to expect in the sequel.</P>
<P>Wilson, who when he received this paper had no previous knowledge of particulars, was for tak∣ing advantage of it for the purpose of earning the hundred guineas. Are you of that mind, now you have heard them? Will you for so paltry a consi∣deration deliver up the lamb into the jaws of the wolf? Will you abet the purposes of this sangui∣nary rascal who, not contented with driving his late dependent from house and home, depriving him of character and all the ordinary means of subsistence, and leaving him almost without a re∣fuge, still thirsts for his blood? If no other per∣son have the courage to set limits to the tyranny of courts of justice, shall not we? Shall we, who earn our livelihood by generous daring, be indebted for a penny to the vile artifices of the informer? Shall we, against whom the whole species is in arms, refuse our protection to an individual, more ex∣posed to, but still less deserving of their persecuti∣on than ourselves?</P>
<P>The representation of the captain produced an instant effect upon the whole company. They all exclaimed, Betray him! No, not for worlds! He is safe. We will protect him at the hazard of our lives. If fidelity and honour be banished from thieves, where shall they find refuge upon the face of the earth? Wilson in particular thank∣ed the captain for his interference, and swore that he would rather part with his right hand, than in∣jure so worthy a lad, or assist such an unheard of villainy. Saying this, he took me by the hand, and bade me fear nothing. Under their roof, no harm should ever befal me; and, even if the un∣derstrappers of the law should discover my retreat, they would to a man die in my defence, sooner
<PB N="94" REF="028752_0322_0FDBF275912C7430"/>
than a hair of my head should be hurt. I thanked him most sincerely for his good will; but I was principally struck with the fervent benevolence of my benefactor. I told them, I found that my ene∣mies were inexorable, and would never be appeas∣ed but with my blood; and I assured them with the most solemn and earnest veracity, that I had done nothing to deserve the persecution which was exercised against me.</P>
<P>The spirit and energy of Mr. Raymond had been such, as to leave no part for me to perform in repelling this unlooked-for danger. Neverthe∣less, it left a very serious impression upon my mind. I had always placed some confidence in the returning equity of Mr. Falkland. Though he persecuted me with bitterness, I could not help believing that he did it unwillingly, and I was per∣suaded it would not be for ever. A man, whose original principles had been so full of rectitude and honour, could not fail at some time or other to re∣collect the injustice of his conduct, and to remit his asperity. This idea had been always present to me, and had in no small degree conspired to insti∣gate my exertions. I said, I will convince my per∣secutor that I am of more value than that I should be sacrificed purely by way of precaution. These expectations on my part had been encouraged by Mr. Falkland's behaviour upon the question of my imprisonment and by various particulars which had occurred since.</P>
<P>But this new incident gave to the subject a to∣tally different appearance. I saw him now, not contented with blasting my reputation, confining me for a period in jail, and reducing me to the si∣tuation of a houseless vagabond, but still continuing his pursuit under these forlorn circumstances with unmitigable cruelty. Indignation and resentment
<PB N="95" REF="028752_0323_0FDBF2C7CFB42058"/>
seemed now for the first time to penetrate my mind. I knew his misery so well, I was so fully acquaint∣ed with its cause, and so strongly impressed with the idea of its being unmerited, that, while I suf∣fered so deeply, I still continued to pity, rather than hate my persecutor. But this incident intro∣duced some change into my feelings. I said, Surely he might now believe that he had sufficiently disarm∣ed me, and might at length suffer me to be at peace. At least ought he not to be contented to leave me to my fate, the perilous and uncertain condition of an escaped felon, instead of thus whetting the animosity and vigilance of my countrymen against me? Were his interference on my behalf in oppo∣sition to the stern severity of Mr. Forester, and his various acts of kindness since, a mere part that he played in order to lull me into patience? Was he perpetually haunted with the fear of an ample re∣taliation, and for that purpose did he personate re∣morse at the very moment that he was secretly keeping every engine at play that could secure my destruction? The very suspicion of such a fact filled me with inexpressible horror, and struck a sudden chill through every fibre of my frame.</P>
<P>Meanwhile my wound was by this time com∣pletely healed, and it became absolutely necessary that I should form some determination respecting the future. My habits of thinking were such as gave me an uncontroulable repugnance to the vocation of my hosts. I did not indeed feel all that aversion and abhorrence to the men that is commonly entertained. I saw and respected their good qualities and their virtues. I was by no means inclined to believe them worse men, or more inimical in their dispositions to the welfare of their species, than the generality of those that look down upon them with most censure. But, though I did
<PB N="96" REF="028752_0324_0FDBF279DC877398"/>
not cease to love them as individuals, my eyes were perfectly opened to their mistakes. If I should otherwise have been in danger of being mis∣led, it was my fortune to have studied felons in a jail, before I studied them in their state of com∣parative prosperity; and this was an infallible an∣tidote to the poison. I saw that in this profession were exerted uncommon energy, ingenuity and fortitude, and I could not help recollecting how admirably beneficial such qualities might be made in the great theatre of human affairs; while in their present direction they were thrown away upon purposes that could scarcely in any sense de∣serve the appellation of useful. Thieves appeared to me to commit a mistaken treason against the general welfare; at the same time that they were of all men the most foolish as to their own interests. The man who risks or sacrifices his life for the public welfare is rewarded with the testimony of an approving conscience; but persons who wan∣tonly defy the institutions of their country for no public good, and whose private interest the least degree of sound judgment might prove to be a thousand times better promoted in every possible instance by a more legitimate proceeding, are in the same respect absurd and self-neglectful, as a man would be who should set himself up as a mark for a file of musqueteers to shoot at.</P>
<P>Viewing the subject in this light, I not only de∣termined that I would have no share in their occu∣pation myself, but thought I could not do less in return for the benefits I had received from them, than endeavour to dissuade them from an employ∣ment in which they must themselves be the greate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> sufferers. My expostulation met with a various reception. All the persons to whom it was ad∣dressed had been tolerably successful in persuading
<PB N="97" REF="028752_0325_0FDBF2C9567D04E0"/>
themselves of the innocence of their calling; and what remained of doubt in their mind was smo∣thered, and, so to speak, laboriously forgotten. Some of them laughed at my arguments as a ridi∣culous piece of missionary quixotism. Others, and particularly our captain, repelled them with the boldness of a man that knows he has got the strong∣est side. But this sentiment of ease and self satis∣faction did not long remain. They had been used to arguments derived from religion and the vene∣rableness of law. They had long ago shaken these from them as so many prejudices. But my view of the subject appealed to principles which they could not contest, and had by no means the air of that customary reproof which is for ever dinned in our ears, without finding one responsive chord in our hearts. Finding themselves urged with objections unexpected and cogent, some of those to whom I addressed them began to grow peevish and impa∣tient of the importunate remonstrance. But this was by no means the case with Mr. Raymond. He was possessed of a candour that I have seldom seen equalled. He was surprised to hear objections so powerful to that which as a matter of speculation he believed he had examined on all sides. He revolved them with impartiality and care. He admitted them slowly, but he at length fully admitted them. He had now but one rejoinder in reserve.</P>
<P>Alas, Williams, said he, it would have been fortunate for me if these views had been presented to me previously to my embracing my present pro∣fession. It is now too late. Those very laws, which by a perception of their iniquity drove me to what I am, now preclude my return. God, we are told, judges of men by what they are at the pe∣riod of judgment, and, whatever be their crimes, if they have seen and abjured the folly of those crimes, receives them to favour. But the institutions of
<PB N="98" REF="028752_0326_0FDBF27CD4D023E8"/>
countries that profess to worship this God, admit no such distinctions. They leave no room for amendment, and seem to have a brutal delight in confounding the demerits of offenders. It signi∣fies not what is the character of the individual at the hour of trial. How changed, how spotless, and how useful avails him nothing. If they disco∣ver at the distance of fourteen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eugene Aram. See Annual Register, for 1759.</NOTE> or of forty years<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">William Andrew Horne. Ditto, ditto.</NOTE> an action for which the law ordains that his life shall be the forfeit, though the interval should have been spent with the purity of a saint and the de∣votedness of a patriot, they disdain to enquire into it. What then can I do? Am I not compelled to go on in folly, having once begun?</P>

<P>I WAS extremely affected by this plea. I could only answer that Mr. Raymond must himself be the best judge of the course it became him to hold; I trusted the case was not so desperate as he ima∣gined. This subject was pursued no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, and was in some degree driven from my thoughts by an incident of a very extraordinary nature. I have already mentioned the animosity that was enter∣tained against me by the infernal portress of this solitary mansion. Jones, the expelled member of the gang, had been her particular favourite. She submitted to his exile indeed, because her genius felt subdued by the energy and inherent greatness of Mr. Raymond; but she submitted with mur∣muring and discontent. Not daring to resent the conduct of the principal in this affair, she collected all the bitterness of her spirit against me. To the unpardonable offence I had thus committed in the first instance, were added the reasonings I had lately offered against the profession of robbery. Robbery was a fundamental article in the creed of this hoary veteran, and she listened to my objec∣tions with the same unaffected astonishment and horror, that an old woman of other habits would listen to one who objected to the agonies and dis∣solution of the Creator of the world, or to the gar∣ment of imputed righteousness prepared to envelope the souls of the elect. Like the religious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, she was sufficiently disposed to avenge a hostility against her opinions with the weapons of sublunary
<PB N="100" REF="028752_0328_0FDBD8DBDD3BC7A8"/>
warfare. Meanwhile I had smiled at the impo∣tence of her malice, as an object of contempt, rather than alarm. She perceived, as I imagine, the slight estimation in which I held her, and this did not a little increase the perturbation of her thoughts.</P>
<P>One day I was left alone with no other person in the house than this swarthy sybil. The thieves had set out upon an expedition about two hours after sunset on the preceding evening, and had not returned, as they were accustomed to do, before day-break the next morning. This was a circum∣stance that sometimes occurred, and therefore did not produce any extraordinary alarm. At one time the scent of prey would lead them beyond the bounds they had prescribed themselves, and at an∣other the fear of pursuit; the life of a thief is always uncertain. The old woman had been pre∣paring during the night for the meal to which they would expect to sit down, as soon as might be after their return.</P>
<P>For myself I had learned from their habits to be indifferent to the regular return of the different parts of the day, and in some degree to turn day into night, and night into day. I had been now several weeks in this residence, and the season was considerably advanced. I had passed some hours during the night in ruminating on my situation. The character and manners of the men among whom I lived were disgusting to me. Their brutal ignorance, their ferocious habits, and their coarse behaviour, instead of becoming more tolerable by custom, hourly added force to my original aver∣sion. The uncommon vigour of their minds and acuteness of their invention in the business they pursued, compared with the odiousness of that business and their habitual depravity, awakened in me sensations too painful to be endured. Moral
<PB N="101" REF="028752_0329_0FDBD947C924BE78"/>
disapprobation, at least in a mind unsubdued by philosophy, I found to be one of the most fertile sources of disquiet and uneasiness. From this pain the society of Mr. Raymond by no means relieved me. He was indeed eminently superior to the vices of the rest; but I did not less exquisitely feel how much he was out of his place, how dispro∣portionably associated, or how contemptibly em∣ployed. I had attempted to counteract the errors under which he and his companions laboured; but I had found the obstacles that presented themselves, much greater than I had imagined.</P>
<P>What was I to do? Was I to wait the issue of this my missionary undertaking, or was I to with∣draw myself immediately? When I withdrew, ought that to be done privately, or with an open avowal of my design, and an endeavour to supply by the force of example what was deficient in my arguments? It was certainly improper, as I de∣clined all participation in the pursuits of these men, did not contribute with my person to the risk by which they subsisted, and had no congeniality with their habits, that I should continue to reside with them any longer than was absolutely necessary. There was one circumstance that rendered this de∣liberation particularly pressing. They intended in a few days removing from their present habitation, to a haunt to which they were accustomed in a distant county. If I did not propose to continue with them, it would perhaps be wrong to accom∣pany them in this removal. The state of calamity to which my inexorable persecutor had reduced me, had made the encounter even of a den of rob∣bers a very fortunate adventure. But the time that had since elapsed, had probably been sufficient to relax the keenness of the quest that was made after me. I sighed for that solitude and obscurity, that
<PB N="102" REF="028752_0330_0FDBD8771E25E540"/>
retreat from the vexations of the world and the voice even of common fame, which I had proposed to myself when I broke my prison.</P>
<P>Such were the meditations which now occupied my mind. At length I grew fatigued with con∣tinued contemplation, and to relieve myself, I pulled out a pocket Horace, the legacy of my beloved Brightwel! I read with avidity the epistle in which he so beautifully describes to Fuscus the grammarian, the pleasures of rural tranquillity and independence. By this time the sun rose from behind the eastern hills, and I open∣ed my casement to contemplate it. The day com∣menced with peculiar brilliancy, and was accom∣panied with all those charms, which the poets of nature, as they have been styled, have so much de∣lighted to describe. There was something in this scene, particularly as succeeding to the active ex∣ertions of intellect, that soothed the mind to com∣posure. Insensibly a confused reverie invaded my faculties, I withdrew from the window, threw my∣self upon the bed, and fell asleep.</P>
<P>I do not recollect the precise images which in this situation passed through my thoughts, but I know that they concluded with the idea of some person, the agent of Mr. Falkland, approaching to assassinate me. This thought had probably been suggested, by the project I meditated of entering once again into the world, and throwing myself within the sphere of his possible vengeance. I imagined that the design of the murderer was to come upon me by surprise, that I was aware of this design, and yet by some fascination had no thought of evading it. I heard the steps of the murderer as he cautiously approached. I seemed to listen to his constrained, yet audible breathings. He came up to the corner where I was placed, and
<PB N="103" REF="028752_0331_0FDBD94D6D93F800"/>
then stopped. The idea became too terrible, I started, opened my eyes, and beheld the execrable hag before mentioned standing over me with a butcher's hatchet. I shifted my situation with a speed that seemed too swift for volition, and the blow already aimed at my scull, sunk impotent upon the bed. Before she could wholly recover her posture I sprung upon her, seized hold of the weapon, and had nearly wrested it from her. But in a moment she resumed her strength and her desperate pur∣pose, and we had a furious struggle, she impelled by inveterate malice, and I resisting for my life. Her vigour was truly Amazonian, and at no time had I ever occasion to contend with a more formid∣able opponent. Her glance was sudden and exact, and the shock with which from time to time she impelled her whole frame, inconceivably vehement. At length I was victorious, took from her her in∣strument of death, and threw her upon the ground. Till now the sobriety of her exertions had curbed her rage; but now she gnashed with her teeth, her eyes seemed as if starting from their sockets, and her body heaved with uncontroulable insanity.</P>
<P>Rascal! devil! she exclaimed, what do you mean to do to me?</P>
<P>Till now the scene had passed uninterrupted by a single word.</P>
<P>Nothing, I replied: begone, infernal witch! and leave me to myself.</P>
<P>Leave you! No: I will thrust my fingers through your ribs, and drink your blood!—You conquer me!—Ha, ha!—Yes, yes! you shall!—I will sit upon you, and press you to hell! I will roast you with brimstone, and dash your entrails into your eyes!—Ha, ha!—ha!</P>
<P>Saying this, she sprung up, and prepared to at∣tack me with redoubled fury. I seized her hands,
<PB N="104" REF="028752_0332_0FDBD87909D26398"/>
and compelled her to sit upon the bed. Thus re∣strained, she continued to express the tumult of her thoughts by grinning, by certain furious motions of her head, and by occasional vehement efforts to disengage herself from my grasp. These contor∣tions and starts were of the nature of those fits, in which the patients are commonly supposed to need three or four persons to hold them. But I found by experience that, under the circumstances in which I was placed, my single strength was suffi∣cient. The spectacle of her emotions was incon∣ceivably frightful. Her violence at length however began to abate, and she became persuaded of the hopelessness of the contest.</P>
<P>Let me go! said she. Why do you hold me? I will not be held!</P>
<P>I wanted you gone from the first, replied I. Are you contented to go now?</P>
<P>Yes, I tell you, misbegotten villain! Yes, rascal!</P>
<P>I immediately loosed my hold. She flew to the door, and, holding it in her hand, said, I will be the death of you yet: you shall not be your own man twenty-four hours longer! With these words she shut the door, and locked it upon me. An action so totally unexpected startled me. Whither was she gone? What was it she intended? To perish by the machinations of such a hag as this, was a thought not to be endured. Death in any form, brought upon us by surprise, and for which the mind has had no time to prepare, is inexpressi∣bly terrible. My thoughts wandered in breathless horror and confusion, and all within was uproar. I endeavoured to break the door, but in vain. I went round the room in search of some tool to assist me. At length I rushed against it with a desperate effort, to which it yielded, and had nearly thrown me from the top of the stairs to the bottom.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="028752_0333_0FDBD94F6E556788"/>
I descended with all possible caution and vigi∣lance. I entered the kitchen, but it was deserted. I searched every other apartment in vain. I went out of the house; still I discovered nothing of my late assailant. It was extraordinary: what could be become of her? what was I to conclude from her disappearance? I reflected on her parting me∣nace. "I should not be my own man twenty-four hours longer." It was mysterious; it did not seem to be the menace of assassination.</P>
<P>Suddenly the recollection of the hand bill brought to us by Wilson rushed upon my memory. Was it possible that she alluded to that in her parting words? Would she set out upon such an expedi∣tion by herself? Was it not dangerous to the whole fraternity, if without the smallest precaution she should bring the officers of justice into the midst of them? It was perhaps improbable she would en∣gage in an undertaking thus desperate. It was not however easy to answer for the conduct of a per∣son in her state of mind. Should I wait, and risk the preservation of my liberty upon the issue?</P>
<P>To this question I returned an immediate nega∣tive. I had resolved in a very short time to quit my present situation, and the difference of a little sooner or a little later could not be very material. It promised to be neither agreeable nor prudent, for me to remain under the roof with a person who had manifested such a fierce and inexpiable hostility. But the consideration which had inexpressibly the most weight with me, belonged to the ideas of im∣prisonment, trial and death. The longer they had formed the subject of my contemplation, the more forcibly was I impelled to avoid them. I had en∣tered upon a system of action for that purpose; I had already made many sacrifices; and I believed that I should never miscarry in this project through
<PB N="106" REF="028752_0334_0FDBD87F75BBAD20"/>
any neglect of mine. The thought of what was reserved for me by my prosecutors sickened my very soul; and the more intimately I was acquainted with oppression and injustice, the more deeply was I penetrated with the abhorrence to which they are entitled.</P>
<P>Such were the reasons that determined me, in∣stantly, abruptly, without leave-taking or acknow∣ledgment for the peculiar and repeated favours I had received, to quit a habitation to which for six weeks I had apparently been indebted for protection, from trial, conviction and an ignominious death. I had come hither pennyless; I quitted my abode with the sum of a few guineas in my possession, Mr. Raymond having insisted upon my taking a share, at the time that each man received his di∣vidend from the common stock. Though I had reason to suppose that the heat of the pursuit against me would be somewhat remitted by the time that had elapsed, the magnitude of the mischief that in an unsavourable event might fall on me, determined me to neglect no imaginable precau∣tion. I recollected the hand bill which was the source of my present alarm, and conceived that one of the principal dangers that threatened me was the recognition of my person, either by such as had previously known me, or even by strangers. It seemed prudent therefore to disguise it as effectu∣ally as I could. For this purpose I had recourse to a parcel of tattered garments that lay in one corner of our habitation. The disguise I chose was that of a beggar. Upon this plan I threw off my shirt. I tied a handkerchief about my head, with which I took care to cover one of my eyes. Over this I drew a piece of an old woollen night∣cap. I selected the worst apparel I could find, and this I reduced to a still more deplorable con∣dition,
<PB N="107" REF="028752_0335_0FDBD950EAE06120"/>
by rents that I purposely made in various places. Thus equipped, I surveyed myself in a looking-glass. I had rendered my appearance com∣plete, nor would any one have suspected that I was not one of the fraternity to which I assumed to belong. I said, This is the form in which tyranny and injustice oblige me to seek for refuge; but bet∣ter, a thousand times better is it, thus to incur contempt with the dregs of mankind, than to trust to the tender mercies of our superiors!</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<P>THE only rule that I laid down to myself in traversing the forest was to take a direction as opposite as possible to that which led to the scene of my late imprisonment. After about two hours walking I arrived at the termination of this ruder scene, and reached that part of the county which is inclosed and cultivated. Here I sat down by the side of a brook, and, pulling out a crust of bread which I had brought away with me, rested and refreshed myself. While I continued in this place, I began to ruminate upon the plan I should lay down for my future proceedings; and my pro∣pensity now led me, as it had done in a former in∣stance, to fix upon the capital which I believed, beside its other recommendations, would prove the safest place for concealment. During these thoughts I saw a couple of peasants passing at a small dis∣tance, and enquired of them respecting the Lon∣don road. By their description I understood that the most immediate way would be to repass a part of the forest, and that it would be necessary to ap∣proach considerably nearer to the county town than I was at the spot which I had at present reached. I did not imagine that this could be a circumstance of considerable importance. My disguise appeared to be a sufficient security against momentary dan∣ger; and I therefore took a path, though not the most direct one, which led towards the point they suggested.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="028752_0337_0FDBD95B411EE938"/>
The occurrences of the day were not very re∣markable. As I passed along a road which lay in my way for a few miles, I saw a carriage advancing in the opposite direction. I debated with myself for a moment, whether I should pass it without notice, or should take this occasion by voice or gesture of making an essay of my trade. This idle disquisition was however speedily driven from my mind when I perceived that the carriage was Mr. Falkland's. The suddenness of the encounter struck me with terror, though perhaps it would have been difficult for calm reflection to have discovered any considerable danger. I withdrew from the road, and skulked behind a hedge till it should have com∣pletely gone by. I was too much occupied with my own feelings to venture to examine whether or no the terrible adversary of my peace were in the carriage. I persuaded myself that he was. I look∣ed after the equipage, and exclaimed, There you may see the luxurious accommodations and appen∣dages of guilt, and here the forlornness that waits upon innocence!—I was to blame to imagine that my case was singular in that respect. I only men∣tion it to show how the most trivial circumstance contributes to embitter the cup to the man of ad∣versity. The thought however was a transient one. I had learned this lesson from my sufferings, not to indulge in the luxury of discontent. As my mind recovered its tranquillity, I began to enquire whe∣ther the phenomenon I had just seen could have any relation to myself. But though my mind was extremely inquisitive and versatile in this respect, I could discover no sufficient ground upon which to build any judgment in the case.</P>
<P>At night I entered a little public house at the extremity of a village, and, seating myself in a corner of the kitchen, asked for some bread and
<PB N="110" REF="028752_0338_0FDBD89662FB42E0"/>
cheese. While I was sitting at my repast, three or four labourers came in for a little refreshment after their work. Ideas respecting the inequality of rank pervade every order in society; and, as my appear∣ance was meaner and more contemptible than theirs, I found it expedient to give way to these gentry of a village alehouse, and remove to an ob∣scurer station. I was surprised and not a little startled to find them fall almost immediately into conversation about my history, whom with a slight variation of circumstances they styled the notorious housebreaker, Kit Williams.</P>
<P>Damn the fellow, said one of them, one never hears of any thing else. O' my life, I think he makes talk for the whole county.</P>
<P>That is very true, replied another. I was at the market town to-day to sell some oats for my master, and there was a hue and cry, some of them thought they had got him, but it was a false alarm.</P>
<P>That hundred guineas is a fine thing, rejoined the first. I should be glad if so be as how it fell in my way.</P>
<P>For the matter of that, said the traveller, I should like a hundred guineas as well as another. But I cannot be of your mind for all that. I should never think money would do me any good, that had been the means of bringing a Christian creature to the gallows.</P>
<P>Poh, that is all my granny! Some folks must be hanged to keep the wheels of our state folks a-going. Beside, I could forgive the fellow all his other robberies, but that he should have been so hardened as to break the house of his own master at last, that is too bad.</P>
<P>Lord, lord, replied the other, I see you know nothing of the matter! I will tell you how it was, as I learned it at the town. I question whether he
<PB N="111" REF="028752_0339_0FDBD95DAB89FF00"/>
ever robbed his master at all. But hark you! you must know as how that squire Falkland was once tried for murder—</P>
<P>Yes, yes, we know that.</P>
<P>Well, he was as innocent as the child unborn. But I supposes as how he is a little soft or so. And so Kit Williams—Kit is a devilish cunning fellow, you may judge that from his breaking prison no less than five times,—so, I say, he threatened to bring his master to trial at the 'sizes all over again, and so frightened him, and got money from him at divers times. Till at last one squire Forester, a relation of t'other, found it all out. And he made the hell of a rumpus, and sent away Kit to prison in a twinky, and I believe he would have been hanged; for when two squires lay their heads to∣gether, they do not much matter law, you know; or else they twist the law to their own ends, I can∣not exactly say which; but it is much at one, when the poor fellow's breath is out of his body.</P>
<P>Though this story was very circumstantially told and with a sufficient detail of particulars, it did not pass unquestioned. Each man maintained the justness of his own statement, and the dispute was long and obstinately pursued. Historians and commen∣tators at length withdrew together. The terrors with which I was seized when this conversation began, were extreme. I stole a side-long glance to one quarter and another, to observe if any man's attention were turned upon me. I trembled as if in an ague fit; and at first felt continual impulses to quit the house and take to my heels. I drew closer in my corner, held aside my head, and seem∣ed from time to time to undergo a total revolution of the animal economy.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="028752_0340_0FDBD898A4159C20"/>
At length the tide of ideas turned. Perceiving they paid no attention to me, the recollection of the full security my disguise afforded recurred strongly to my thoughts, and I began inwardly to exult, though I did not venture to obtrude myself to examination. By degrees I began to be amused at the absurdity of their tales, and the variety of the falsehoods I heard asserted around me. My soul seemed to expand; I felt a pride in the self-possession and lightness of heart with which I could listen to the scene; and I determined to pro∣long and heighten the enjoyment. Accordingly, when they were withdrawn, I addressed myself to our hostess, a buxom, bluff, good humoured widow, and asked what sort of a man this Kit Williams might be? She replied that, as she was informed, he was as handsome, likely a lad, as any in four counties round; and that she loved him for his cleverness, by which be outwitted all the keepers they could set over him, and made his way through stone walls, as if they were so many cobwebs. I observed that the country was so thoroughly alarmed, that I did not think it possible he should escape the pursuit that was set up after him. This idea excited her immediate indignation; she said she hoped he was far enough away by this time, but, if not, she wished the curse of God might light on them that betrayed so noble a fellow to a fatal end!—Though she little thought that the per∣son of whom she spoke was so near her, yet the sincere and generous warmth with which she in∣terested herself in my behalf, gave me considerable pleasure. With this sensation to sweeten the fa∣tigues of the day and the calamities of my situa∣tion, I retired from the kitchen to a neighbouring barn, laid myself down upon some straw, and fell into a profound sleep.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="028752_0341_0FDBD95F2B437850"/>
The next day about noon as I was pursuing my journey, I was overtaken by two men on horseback, who stopped me to enquire respecting a person that they supposed might have passed along that road. As they proceeded in their description I perceived with astonishment and terror that I was myself the person to whom their questions related. They en∣tered into a tolerably accurate detail of the various characteristics by which my person might best be distinguished. They said, they had good reason to believe that I had been seen at a place in that county the very day before. While they were speaking, a third person who had fallen behind came up, and my alarm was greatly increased upon seeing that this person was the servant of Mr. Fores∣ter, who had visited me in prison about a fortnight before my escape. My best resource in this crisis was composure and apparent indifference. It was for∣tunate for me that my disguise was so complete, that the eye of Mr. Falkland itself could scarcely have penetrated it. I had been aware for some time before that this was a refuge which events might make necessary, and had endeavoured to arrange and methodise my ideas upon the subject. From my youth I had possessed a considerable faci∣lity in the art of imitation; and, when I quitted my retreat under the roof of Mr. Raymond, I adopted along with my beggar's attire a peculiar slouching and clownish gait to be used whenever there should appear the least chance of my being observed, together with an Irish brogue which I had had an opportunity of studying in my prison. Such are the miserable expedients and so great the studied artifice, which man, who never deserves the name of manhood but in proportion as he is erect and independent, may find it necessary to employ, for the purpose of eluding the inexorable
<PB N="114" REF="028752_0342_0FDBD8B20D32E418"/>
animosity and unfeeling tyranny of his fellow man! I had made use of this brogue, though I have not thought it necessary to write it down in my narra∣tive, in the conversation of the village alehouse. Mr. Forester's servant as he came up observed that his companions were engaged in conversation with me; and, guessing at the subject, asked whether they had gained any intelligence. He added to the information at which they had already hinted, that a resolution was taken to spare neither diligence nor expence for my discovery and apprehension, and that they were satisfied that, if I were above ground and in the kingdom, it would be impossible for me to escape them.</P>
<P>Every new incident that had occurred to me, thus tended to impress upon my mind the extreme danger to which I was exposed. I could almost have imagined that I was the sole subject of general attention, and that the whole world was in arms to exterminate me. The very idea tingled through every fibre of my frame. But, terrible as it ap∣peared to my imagination, it did but give new energy to my purpose; and I determined that I would not voluntarily resign the field, that is pro∣perly speaking my neck to the cord of the execu∣tioner, notwithstanding the greatest superiority in my assailants. But the incidents which had be∣fallen me, though they did not change my purpose, induced me to examine over again the means by which that purpose might be effected. The con∣sequence of this revisal was to determine me to bend my course to the nearest sea-port on the west side of the island, and transport myself to Ireland. I cannot now tell what it was that inclined me to prefer this scheme to that which I had originally formed. Perhaps the latter, which had been for some time present to my imagination, for that rea∣son
<PB N="115" REF="028752_0343_0FDBD9662A286390"/>
appeared the more obvious of the two; and I found an appearance of complexity, which the mind did not stay to explain to itself, in substi∣tuting the other in its stead.</P>
<P>I arrived without farther impediment at the place from which I intended to sail, enquired for a vessel which I found ready to put to sea in a few hours, and agreed with the captain for my passage. Ireland had to me the disadvantage of being a de∣pendency of the British government, and therefore a place of less security than most other countries which are divided from it by the ocean. To judge from the diligence with which I seemed to be pur∣sued in England, it was not improbable that the zeal of my persecutors might follow me to the other side of the channel. It was however suffici∣ently agreeable to my mind that I was upon the point of being removed one step farther from the danger which was so grievous to my imagination.</P>
<P>Could there be any peril in the short interval that was to elapse before the vessel was to weigh anchor, and quit the English shore? Probably not. A very short time had intervened between my de∣termination for the sea and my arrival at this place; and, if any new alarm had been given to my per∣secutors, it proceeded from the old woman a very few days before. I hoped I had anticipated their diligence. Meanwhile that I might neglect no reasonable precaution, I went instantly on board, resolved that I would not unnecessarily, by walking in the streets of the town, expose myself to any untoward accident.</P>

<PB N="116" REF="028752_0344_0FDBD8B6DE86C9F0"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<P>THE time was now nearly elapsed that was prescribed for our stay, and orders for weighing anchor were every moment expected, when we were hailed by a boat from the shore with two other men in it beside those that rowed. They entered our vessel in an instant. They were officers of justice. The passengers, five persons beside myself, were ordered upon deck for exami∣nation. I was inexpressibly disturbed at the oc∣currence of such a circumstance in so unseasonable a moment. I took it for granted that it was of me that they were in search. Was it possible that by any unaccountable accident they should have got an intimation of my disguise? It was infinitely more distressing to encounter them upon this nar∣row stage and under these pointed circumstances, than, as I had before encountered my pursuers, under the appearance of an indifferent person. My recollection however did not forsake me. I confided in my conscious disguise and my Irish brogue, as a rock of dependence against all acci∣dents.</P>
<P>No sooner did we appear upon deck than to my great consternation I could observe the attention of our guests principally turned upon me. They asked a few frivolous questions of such of my fel∣low passengers as happened to be nearest to them; and then turning to me enquired my name, who I was, whence I came, and what had brought me there? I had scarcely opened my mouth to reply,
<PB N="117" REF="028752_0345_0FDBD967688609E8"/>
when with one consent they laid hold of me, said I was their prisoner, and declared that my accent, together with the correspondence of my person, would be sufficient to convict me before any court in England. I was hurried out of the vessel into the boat in which they came, and seated between them, as if by way of precaution lest I should spring overboard and by any means escape them.</P>
<P>I now took it for granted that I was once more in the power of Mr. Falkland, and the idea was inexpressibly mortifying and afflictive to my ima∣gination. Escape from his pursuit, freedom from his tyranny, were objects upon which my whole soul was bent; could no human ingenuity and ex∣ertion effect them? Did his power reach through all space, and his eye penetrate every concealment? Was he like that mysterious being, to protect us from whose fierce revenge mountains and hills we are told might fall on us in vain! No idea is more heart-sickening and tremendous than this. But in my case it was not a subject of reasoning or of faith; I could derive no comfort either openly from unbelief, or secretly from the remoteness and incomprehensibility of the conception; it was an affair of sense; I felt the fangs of the tyger striking deep into my heart.</P>
<P>But, though this impression were at first ex∣ceedingly strong, and accompanied with its usual attendants in dejection and pusillanimity of spirit, yet my mind soon began as it were mechanically, to turn upon the consideration of the distance be∣tween this sea-port and my county prison, and the various opportunities of escape that might offer themselves in the interval. My first duty was to avoid betraying myself more than it might after∣wards appear I was betrayed already. It was pos∣sible that, though apprehended, my apprehension
<PB N="118" REF="028752_0346_0FDBD8B8B2F97428"/>
might have been determined on upon some slight score, and that by my dexterity I might render my dismission as sudden as my arrest had been. It was even possible that I had been seized through a mis∣take, and that the present measure might have no connection with Mr. Falkland's affair. Upon every supposition it was my business to gain information, and not to communicate it.</P>
<P>I soon found the benefits of this resolution. In my passage from the ship to the town I did not utter a word. My conductors commented on my sulkiness, but remarked that it would avail me nothing, I should infallibly swing, as it was never known that any body got off; who was tried for robbing his majesty's mail. It is easy to conceive the lightness of heart which was communicated to me by these words: I persisted however in the silence I had meditated. From the rest of their conversation, which was sufficiently voluble, I learned that the mail from Edinburgh to London had been robbed about ten days before by two Irishmen, that one of them was already secured, and that I was taken up upon suspicion of being the other. They had a description of his person which, though, as I afterwards found, it disagreed from mine in several material articles, appeared to them to tally to the minutest tittle. The intelli∣gence that the whole proceeding against me was founded in a mistake, took an oppressive load from my mind. I believed that I should immediately be able to establish my innocence to the satisfaction of any magistrate in the kingdom; and, though crossed in my plans, and thwarted in my design of quitting the island even after I was already at sea, this was but a trifling inconvenience compared with what I had had but too much reason to fear.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="028752_0347_0FDBD96DA3BB3398"/>
As soon as we came ashore I was conducted to the house of a justice of peace, a man who had formerly been the captain of a collier, but who, having been successful in the world, had quitted this wandering life, and for some years had had the honour to represent his majesty's person. We were detained for some time in a sort of anti-room, waiting his reverence's leisure. The persons by whom I had been taken up were experienced in their trade, and insisted upon employing this in∣terval in searching me, in presence of two of his worship's servants. They found upon me fifteen guineas and some silver. They required me to strip myself perfectly naked, that they might examine whether I had bank notes concealed any where about my person. They took up the detached par∣cels of my miserable attire as I threw it from me, and felt them one by one to discover whether the articles of which they were in search might by any device be sown up in them. To all this I submit∣ted without murmuring. It might probably come to the same thing at last, and summary justice was sufficiently coincident with my views, my principal object being to get as soon as possible out of the clutches of the respectable persons who now had me in custody.</P>
<P>This operation was scarcely completed, before we were directed to be ushered into his worship's apartment. My accusers opened the charge, and told him that they had been ordered to this town upon an intimation that one of the persons who robbed the Edinburgh mail was to be sound here; and that they had taken me on board a vessel which was by this time under sail for Ireland. Well, says his worship, that is your story; now let us hear what account the gentleman gives of him∣self. What is your name, ha, sirrah? and from
<PB N="120" REF="028752_0348_0FDBD8BAA42A7FC8"/>
what part of Tipperary are you pleased to come? I had already taken my determination upon this article; and, the moment I learned the particu∣lars of the charge against me, resolved, for the pre∣sent at least, to lay aside my Irish accent, and speak my native tongue. This I had done in the very few words I had spoken to my conductors in the anti-room: they stared at the metamorphosis, but they had gone too far for it to be possible they should retract in consistence with their honour. I now told the justice that I was no Irishman, nor had ever been in that country: I was a native of England. This occasioned a consulting of the de∣position in which my person was supposed to be described, and which my conductors had brought along with them for their direction. To be sure that required that the offender should be an Irish∣man.</P>
<P>Observing his worship hesitate, I thought this was the time to push the matter a little farther. I referred to the paper, and shewed him that the description neither tallied as to height nor com∣plexion. But then it did as to years and the colour of the hair; and it was not this gentleman's habit, as he informed me, to squabble about trifles, or to let a man's neck out of the halter for a pretended flaw of a few inches in his stature. If a man were too short, he said, there was no remedy like a little stretching. The miscalculation in my case hap∣pened to be the opposite way, but his reverence did not think proper to lose his jest. Upon the whole he was somewhat at a loss how to proceed.</P>
<P>My conductors observed this, and began to trem∣ble for the reward, which two hours ago they thought as good as in their own pocket. To retain me in custody they judged to be a safe specula∣tion; if it turned out a mistake at last, they felt
<PB N="121" REF="028752_0349_0FDBD96EE789B828"/>
little apprehension of a suit for false imprisonment from a poor man accoutred as I was in rags. They therefore urged his worship to comply with their views. They told him that to be sure the evidence against me did not prove so strong, as for their part they heartily wished it had, but that there were a number of suspicious circumstances respecting me. When I was brought up to them upon the deck of the vessel, I spoke as fine an Irish brogue as one shall hear in a summer's day; and now all at once there was not the least particle of it left. In searching me they had sound upon me fifteen guineas; how should a poor beggar lad, such as I appeared, come honestly by fifteen guineas? Beside, when they had stripped me naked, though my dress was so shabby, my skin had all the sleekness of a gentleman. In fine, for what pur∣pose could a poor beggar, who had never been in Ireland in his life, want to transport himself to that country? It was as clear as the sun that I was no better than I should be. This reasoning, together with some significant winks and gestures between the justice and the plaintiffs, brought him over to their way of thinking. He said, I must go to War∣wick, where it seems the other robber was at pre∣sent in custody, and be confronted with him; and if then every thing appeared fair and satisfactory, I should be discharged.</P>
<P>No intelligence could be more terrible than that which was contained in these words. That I, who had found the whole country in arms against me, who was exposed to a pursuit so peculiarly vigilant and penetrating, should now be dragged to the very centre of the kingdom, without power of accom∣modating myself to circumstances, and under the immediate custody of the officers of justice, seem∣ed to my ears almost the same thing as if they had pronounced upon me a sentence of death! I
<PB N="122" REF="028752_0350_0FDBD8BBC4B3CBE0"/>
strenuously urged the injustice of this proceeding. I observed to the magistrate that it was impossible I should be the person at whom the description pointed. It required an Irishman; I was no Irish∣man. It described a person shorter than I; a cir∣cumstance of all others the least capable of being counterfeited. There was not the slightest reason for detaining me in custody. I had been already disappointed of my voyage and lost the money I had paid down through the officiousness of these gentlemen in apprehending me. I assured his wor∣ship that every delay under my circumstances was of the utmost importance to me. It was impossi∣ble to devise a greater injury to be inflicted on me, than the proposal that, instead of being permitted to proceed upon my voyage, I should be sent un∣der arrest into the heart of the kingdom.</P>
<P>My remonstrances were in vain. The justice was by no means inclined to digest the being ex∣postulated with in this manner by a person in the habiliments of a beggar. In the midst of my ad∣dress he would have silenced me for my imperti∣nence, but that I spoke with an earnestness with which he was wholly unable to contend. When I had finished, he told me that it was all to no pur∣pose, and that it might have been better for me if I had shown myself less insolent. It was clear that I was a vagabond and a suspicious person. The more earnest I showed myself to get off, the more reason there was he should keep me fast. Perhaps after all I should turn out to be the felon in ques∣tion. But, if I was not that, he had no doubt I was worse; a poacher, or for what he knew a murderer. He had a kind of a notion that he had seen my face before about some such affair; out of all doubt I was an old offender. He had it in his choice to send me to hard labour as a vagrant upon the strength of my appearance and the contradic∣tions
<PB N="123" REF="028752_0351_0FDBD9732AB87A48"/>
in my story, or to order me to Warwick; and out of the spontaneous goodness of his disposition he chose the milder alternative. He could assure me I should not slip through his fingers. It was of more benefit to his majesty's government to hang one such fellow as he suspected me to be, than out of misguided tenderness to concern one∣self for the good of all the beggars in the nation.</P>
<P>Finding that it was impossible to work on a man, so fully impressed with his own dignity and im∣portance and my utter insignificance, in the way I desired, I claimed that at least the money taken from my person should be restored to me. This was granted. His worship perhaps suspected that he had stretched a point in what he had already done, and was therefore the less unwilling to relax in this incidental circumstance. My conductors did not oppose themselves to this indulgence, for a reason that will appear in the sequel. The justice however enlarged upon his clemency in this pro∣ceeding. He did not know whether he was not exceeding the spirit of his commission in complying with my demand. So much money in my posses∣sion could not be honestly come by. But it was his temper to soften, as far as could be done with propriety, the strict letter of the law.</P>
<P>There were cogent reasons why the gentlemen who had originally taken me into custody, chose that I should continue in their custody, when my examination was over. Every man is in his dif∣ferent mode susceptible to a sense of honour; and they did not choose to encounter the disgrace that would accrue to them if justice had been done. Every man is in some degree influenced by the love of power; and they were willing I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> owe any benefit I received, to their sovereign grace and be∣nignity, and not to the mere reason of the case. It was not however an unsubstantial honour and bar∣ren
<PB N="124" REF="028752_0352_0FDBD8BDA1F56BA0"/>
power that formed the object of their pursuit: no, their views were deeper than that. In a word, though they chose that I should retire from the seat of justice as I had come before it, a prisoner, yet the tenour of my examination had obliged them in spite of themselves to suspect, that I was innocent of the charge they alleged against me. Appre∣hensive therefore that the hundred guineas that had been offered as a reward for taking the robber, was completely out of the question in the present business, they were contented to strike at smaller game. Having conducted me to an inn, and given directions respecting a vehicle for the journey, they took me aside, while one of them addressed me in the following manner:</P>
<P>You see, my lad, how the case stands; heigh for Warwick is the word! and, when we are got there, what may happen then I will not pretend for to say. Whether you are innocent or no is no business of mine; but you are not such a chicken as to suppose, if so be as you are innocent, that that will make your game altogether sure. You say, your business calls you another way, and as how you are in haste: I have not the heart to cross any man in his concerns, if I can help it. If there∣fore you will give us them there fifteen shiners, why snug is the word. They are of no use to you; a beggar, you know, is always at home. For the matter of that we could have had them in the way of business as you saw at the justice's. But I am a man of principle; I loves to do things above board, and scorns to extort a shilling from any man.</P>
<P>He who is tinctured with principles of moral discrimination, is apt upon occasion to be run away with by his feelings in that respect, and to forget the immediate interest of the moment. I confess that the first sentiment excited in my mind by this
<PB N="125" REF="028752_0353_0FDBD9742C355A30"/>
overture was that of indignation. I was irresist∣ably impelled to give utterance to this feeling, and postpone for a moment the consideration of the future. I replied with the severity which so base a proceeding appeared to deserve. My bear-leaders were considerably surprised with my firmness, but seemed to think it beneath them to contest with me the principles I delivered. He who had made the overture contented himself with replying, Well, well, my lad, do as you will; you are not the first man that has been hanged rather than part with a few guineas. His words did not pass un∣heeded by me. They were strikingly applicable to my situation, and I was determined not to suffer the occasion to escape me unimproved.</P>
<P>The pride of these gentlemen however was too great to admit of farther parley for the present. They left me abruptly; having first ordered an old man, the father of the landlady, to stay in the room with me while they were absent. The old man they ordered for security to lock the door and put the key in his pocket, at the same time mention∣ing below stairs the station in which they had left me, that the people of the house might have an eye upon what went forward, and not suffer me to escape. What was the intention of this manoeuvre I am unable certainly to pronounce. Probably it was a sort of compromise between their pride and their avarice, being desirous for some reason or other to drop me as soon as convenient, and there∣fore determining to wait the result of my private meditations on the proposal they had made.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<P>THEY were no sooner withdrawn than I cast my eye upon the old man, and found something extremely venerable and interesting in his appear∣ance. His form was above the middle size. It indicated that his strength had once been consider∣able; nor was it at this time by any means anni∣hilated. His hair was in considerable quantity, and was as white as the driven snow. His com∣plexion was healthful and ruddy, at the same time that his face was furrowed with wrinkles. In his eye there was remarkable vivacity, and his whole countenance was strongly expressive of good nature. The boorishness of his rank in society was lost, in the cultivation his mind had derived from habits of sensibility and benevolence.</P>
<P>The view of his figure immediately introduced a train of ideas into my mind respecting the ad∣vantage to be drawn from the presence of such a person. The attempt to take any step without his consent was hopeless, for, though I should succeed with regard to him, he could easily give the alarm to other persons who would no doubt be within call. Add to which, I could scarcely have prevail∣ed on myself to offer any offence to a person whose first appearance so strongly engaged my affection and esteem. In reality my thoughts were turned into a different channel. I was impressed with an ardent wish, to be able to call this man my bene∣factor. Pursued by a train of ill-fortune, I could
<PB N="127" REF="028752_0355_0FDBD97AFA024010"/>
no longer consider myself as a member of society. I was a solitary being, cut off from the expectation of sympathy, kindness and the good-will of man∣kind. I was strongly impelled by the situation in which the present moment placed me, to indulge in a luxury which my destiny seemed to have de∣nied. I could not conceive of the smallest com∣parison between the idea of deriving my liberty from the spontaneous kindness of a worthy and ex∣cellent mind, and that of being indebted for it to the selfishness and baseness of the worst members of society. It was thus that I allowed myself in the wantonness of refinement even in the midst of destruction.</P>
<P>Guided by these sentiments, I requested his at∣tention to the circumstances by which I had been brought into my present situation. He immediate∣ly signified his assent, and said he would chearfully listen to any thing I thought proper to communi∣cate. I told him the persons who had just left me in charge with him, had come to this town for the purpose of apprehending some person who had been guilty of robbing the mail; that they had chosen to take me up under this warrant, and had con∣ducted me before a justice of the peace; that they had soon detected their mistake, the person in ques∣tion being an Irishman, and differing from me both in country and stature; but that by collusion be∣tween them and the justice they were permitted to retain me in custody, and pretended to undertake to conduct me to Warwick to confront me with my accomplice; that in searching me at the jus∣tice's they had found a sum of money in my pos∣session which excited their cupidity, and that they had just been proposing to me to give me my li∣berty upon condition of my surrendering this sum into their hands. Under these circumstances I re∣quested
<PB N="128" REF="028752_0356_0FDBD8C7A82D37A0"/>
him to consider whether he would wish to render himself the instrument of their extortion. I put myself into his hands, and solemnly averred the truth of the facts I had just stated. If he would assist me in my escape, it could have no other effect than to disappoint the base passions of my conductors. I would upon no account expose him to any real inconvenience; but I was well as∣sured that the same generosity that prompted him to a good deed, would enable him effectually to vindicate it when done; and that those who de∣tained me, when they had lost sight of their prey, would feel covered with confusion, and not dare to take another step in the affair.</P>
<P>The old man listened to what I related with cu∣riosity and interest. He said that he had always felt an abhorrence to the sort of people who had me in their hands, that he had an aversion to the task they had just imposed upon him, but that he could not refuse some little disagreeable offices to oblige his daughter and son-in-law. He had no doubt, from my countenance and manner, of the truth of what I had asserted to him. It was an extraordinary request I had made, and he did not know what had induced me to think him the sort of person to whom it might properly be made. In reality however his habits of thinking were uncom∣mon, and he felt more than half inclined to act as I desired. One thing at least he would desire of me in return, which was to be faithfully informed in some degree respecting the person he was asked to oblige. What was my name?</P>
<P>The question came upon me unprepared. But, whatever might be the consequences, I could not bear to deceive the person by whom it was put, and in the circumstances under which it was put.
<PB N="129" REF="028752_0357_0FDBD97C6A880FC0"/>
The practice of perpetual falshood is too painful a task. I replied that my name was Williams.</P>
<P>He paused His eye was fixed upon me. I saw his complexion alter at the repetition of that word. He proceeded with visible anxiety.</P>
<P>My christian name?</P>
<P>Caleb.</P>
<P>Good God! it could not be—? He conjured me by every thing that was sacred to an∣swer him faithfully to one question more. I was not?—no, it was impossible—the person who had formerly lived servant with Mr. Falkland of—?</P>
<P>I told him that, whatever might be the meaning of his question, I would answer him truly. I was the individual he mentioned.</P>
<P>As I uttered these words, the old man rose from his seat. He was sorry that fortune had been so unpropitious to him, as for him ever to have set eyes upon me! I was a monster with whom the very earth groaned!</P>
<P>I intreated that he would suffer me to explain this new misapprehension, as he had done in the former instance. I had no doubt that I should do it equally to his satisfaction:</P>
<P>No! no! no! he would upon no consideration admit that his ears should suffer such contamina∣tion. This case and the other were very different. There was no criminal upon the face of the earth, no murderer, half so detestable, as the person who could prevail upon himself to utter the charges I had done by way of recrimination against so gene∣rous a master.—The old man was in a perfect ago∣ny with the recollection.</P>
<P>At length he calmed himself enough to say he should never cease to grieve that he had held a mo∣ment's parley with me. He did not know what was the conduct that severe justice required of
<PB N="130" REF="028752_0358_0FDBD8CD2F8B1CB0"/>
him; but, since he had come into the knowledge of who I was only by my own confession, it was irreconcilably repugnant to his feelings to make use of that knowledge to my injury. Here there∣fore all relation between us ceased; and indeed it would be an abuse of words to consider me in the light of a human creature. He would do me no mischief; but then on the other hand he would not for the world be any way assisting and abetting me.</P>
<P>I was inexpressibly affected at the abhorrence this good and benevolent creature expressed against me. I could not be silent; I endeavoured once and again to prevail upon him to hear me. But his determination was unalterable. Our contest lasted for some time, and he at length terminated it by ringing the bell, and calling up the waiter. A very little while after this my conductors enter∣ed, and these two other persons withdrew.</P>
<P>It was a part of the singularity of my fate that it hurried me from one species of anxiety and dis∣tress to another, too rapidly to suffer any one of them to sink deeply into my mind. I am apt to believe in the retrospect that half the calamities I was destined to endure would infalliby have over∣whelmed and destroyed me. But, as it was, I had no leisure to chew the cud upon cross accidents as they befel me, but was under the necessity of for∣getting them to guard against peril that the next moment seemed ready to crush me. The behavi∣our of this incomparable and amiable old man cut me to the heart. It was a dreadful prognostic for all my future life. But, as I have just observed, my conductors entered, and another subject called imperiously upon my attention. I could have been content, mortified as I was at this instant, to have been shut up in some impenetrable solitude, and to
<PB N="131" REF="028752_0359_0FDBD9835A468448"/>
have wrapped myself up in inconsolable misery. But the grief I endured had not such power over me, as that I could be content to risk the being led to the gallows. The love of life, and still more a hatred against oppression, steeled my heart against that species of inertion. In the scene that had just passed I had indulged, as I have said, in a wantonness and luxury of refinement. It was time that that indulgence should be brought to a period. It was dangerous to trifle any more upon the brink of fate; and, penetrated as I was with sadness by the result of my last attempt, I was little disposed to any unnecessary circumambulation. I was exactly in the temper in which the gentlemen who had me in their power, would have desired to find me. Accordingly we entered upon immediate business; and, after some chaffering, they agreed to accept eleven guineas as the price of my freedom. To preserve however the chariness of their reputation, they insisted upon conducting me with them for a few miles on the outside of a stage coach. They then pretended that the road they had to travel lay in a cross-country direction; and, having quitted the vehicle, they suffered me, almost as soon as it was out of sight, to shake off this troublesome as∣sociation, and follow my own inclinations. It may be worth remarking by the way, that these fellows outwitted themselves at their own trade. They had laid hold of me at first under the idea of a prize of a hundred guineas: they had since been glad to accept a composition of eleven; but, if they had retained me a little longer in their pos∣session, they would have found the possibility of ac∣quiring the sum that had originally excited their pursuit, upon a different score.</P>
<P>The mischances that had befallen me in my late attempt to escape from my pursuers by having re∣course to the sea, deterred me from the thought
<PB N="132" REF="028752_0360_0FDBD8CE6AD01D10"/>
of repeating the same experiment. I therefore once more returned to the suggestion of hiding myself, at least for the present, amidst the crowds of the metropolis. Meanwhile I by no means thought proper to venture by the direct route, and the less so as that was the course which would be steered by my late conductors; but took my road along the borders of Wales. The only incident worth relating in this place, occurred in a pro∣ject I thought proper to adopt for crossing the Se∣vern in a particular point. The mode of crossing was by a ferry; and by some strange inadvertence I lost my way so completely that I was wholly un∣able that night to reach the ferry, and arrive at the town which I had destined for my repose.</P>
<P>It was by a singular fatality that this petty dis∣appointment, in the midst of the overwhelming considerations that might have been expected to en∣gross every thought of my mind, was borne by me with particular impatience. I was that day un∣commonly fatigued. Previously to the time when I mistook, or at least was aware of the mistake of the road, the sky had become exceedingly black and lowering, and soon after the clouds burst down in sheets of rain. I was then in the midst of a heath, without tree or covering of any sort to shel∣ter me. I was thoroughly drenched in a moment. In this uncomfortable state I proceeded with a sort of sullen determination. By and by the rain gave place to a storm of hail. The hail-stones were large and frequent. I was ill defended from them by the miserable covering I wore, and they seemed to cut me in a thousand directions. The hail∣storm subsided, and was again succeeded by a heavy rain. It was at this time I perceived that I had totally deviated from my way. I could discover neither man, nor beast, nor habitation of any
<PB N="133" REF="028752_0361_0FDBD98568126088"/>
kind. I walked on, consulting at every turn the path it would be proper for me to pursue, and in no instance able to discern a sufficient reason for rejecting the one and preferring the other. My mind was in a most disconsolate and repin∣ing state. I muttered imprecations and murmur∣ing, as I passed along. I was full of loathing and abhorrence against life, and every thing that life carries in its train. After wandering without any certain direction for two hours, I was overtaken by the night, and obliged to take up my rest for the present in a solitary shed.</P>
<P>In a corner of the shed which I had chosen for my retreat I found some clean straw. I threw off my rags, placing them in a situation where they would best be dried, and buried myself amidst this friendly warmth. Through fatigue of mind and body it happened in this instance, though in general my repose was remarkably short, that I slept till almost noon of the next day. When I rose, I found that I was at no great distance from the ferry, which I crossed, and entered the town where I intended to have rested the preceding night.</P>
<P>It was market day. As I passed near the cross, I observed two people look at me with great ear∣nestness, after which one of them exclaimed, I will be damned, if I do not think that is the very fellow those men were enquiring for, who set off an hour ago by the coach for—. I was ex∣tremely alarmed at this information; and, quicken∣ing my pace, turned sharp down a narrow lane. The moment I was out of sight I ran with all the speed I could exert, and did not think myself safe till I was several miles distant from the place where this information had reached my ears. I have always
<PB N="134" REF="028752_0362_0FDBD8D0293D0D78"/>
believed that the men to whom it related were the very persons who had apprehended me on board the ship in which I had embarked for Ireland, that by some accident they had met with the description of my person as published on the part of Mr. Falk∣land, and that from putting together the circum∣stances they had been led to believe that this was the very individual who had lately been in their custody. Indeed it was a piece of infatuation in me for which I am now unable to account, that, after the various indications which had oc∣curred in that affair proving to them that I was a man in very critical and peculiar circumstances, I should have persisted in wearing the same dis∣guise without the smallest alteration. My escape in the present case was eminently fortunate. If I had not lost my way in consequence of the hail-storm of the preceding night, or if I had not so greatly overslept myself this very morn∣ing, I must almost infallibly have fallen into the hands of these infernal blood-hunters.</P>
<P>The town they had chosen for their next stage, the name of which I had thus caught in the mar∣ket-place, was the very town to which, but for this intimation, I should have immediately proceeded. As it was, I determined to take a road as wide of it as possible. In the first place to which I came, in which it was practicable to do so, I bought a great coat which I drew over my beggar's weeds, and a better hat. The hat I slouched over my face, and covered one of my eyes with a green silk shade. The handkerchief, which I had hitherto worn about my head, I now tied about the lower part of my visage, so as to cover my mouth. By degrees I discarded every part of my former dress, and wore for my upper garment a kind of carman's frock,
<PB N="135" REF="028752_0363_0FDBD9871BEAAEC8"/>
which, being of the better sort, made me look like the son of a reputable farmer of the lower class. Thus equipped, I proceeded on my journey, and, after a thousand alarms, precautions, and circui∣tous deviations from the direct path, arrived safe∣ly in London.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<P>HERE then was the termination of an im∣mense series of labours, upon which no man could have looked back without astonishment, or forward without a sentiment bordering on despair. It was at a price which defies estimation that I had pur∣chased this resting-place; whether we consider the efforts it had cost me to escape from the walls of my prison, or the dangers and anxieties to which I had been a prey from that hour to the present.</P>
<P>But why do I call the point at which I was now arrived a resting place? Alas, it was diametrically the reverse! It was my first and immediate business to review all the projects of disguise I had hitherto conceived, to derive every improvement I could in∣vent from the practice to which I had been sub∣jected, and to manufacture a veil of concealment more impenetrable than ever. This was an effort to which I could see no end. In ordinary cases the hue and cry after a supposed offender is a mat∣ter of temporary operation; but ordinary cases formed no standard for the colossal intelligence of Mr. Falkland. For the same reason, London, which appears an inexhaustible reservoir of con∣cealment to the majority of mankind, brought no such consolatory sentiment to my mind. Whether life were worth my accepting on such terms I can∣not pronounce. I only know that I persisted in this exertion of my faculties, through a sort of pa∣rental love that men are accustomed to entertain
<PB N="137" REF="028752_0365_0FDBD98D48D300B0"/>
for their intellectual offspring; the more thought I had expended in rearing it to its present perfec∣tion, the less did I find myself disposed to abandon it. Another motive not less strenuously exciting me to perseverance, was the ever-growing repug∣nance I felt to injustice and arbitrary power.</P>
<P>The first evening of my arrival in town I slept at an obscure inn at the borough of Southwark, choosing that side of the metropolis on account of its lying entirely wide of the part of England from which I came. I entered the inn in the evening in my countryman's frock; and, having paid for my lodging before I went to bed, equipped myself next morning as differently as my wardrobe would al∣low, and left the house before day. The frock I made up into a small packet; and, having carried it to a distance as great as I thought necessary, I dropped it in the corner of an alley through which I passed. My next care was to furnish myself with another suit of apparel totally different from any to which I had hitherto had recourse. The exterior which I was now induced to assume was that of a Jew. One of the gang of thieves upon—fo∣rest had been of that race; and, by the talent of mimicry, which I have already stated myself to possess, I could copy their pronunciation of the English language, sufficiently to answer such occa∣sions as were likely to present themselves. One of the preliminaries I adopted was to repair to a quar∣ter of the town in which great numbers of this people reside, and study their complexion and countenance. Having made such provision as my prudence suggested to me, I retired for that night to an inn on the side of Mile End and Wapping. Here I accoutred myself in my new habiliments; and, having employed the same precautions as before, retired from my lodging at a time least exposed to
<PB N="138" REF="028752_0366_0FDBD8D52EB805A0"/>
observation. It is unnecessary to describe all the particulars of my new equipage. Suffice it to say, that one of my cares was to discolour my complexion, and give it the dun and sallow hue which is in most instances characteristic of the tribe to which I assumed to belong; and that, when my metamorphosis was finished, I could not upon the strictest examination conceive, that any one could have traced out the person of Caleb Williams in this new disguise.</P>
<P>Thus far advanced in the execution of my pro∣ject, I deemed it advisable to procure a lodging, and change my late wandering life for a stationary one. In this lodging I constantly secluded myself from the rising to the setting of the sun; the pe∣riods I allowed for exercise and air were few, and those few by night. I was even careful of so much as approaching the window of my apartment, though upon the attic story; a principle I laid down to myself was, not wantonly and unneces∣sarily to expose myself to risk, however slight that risk might appear. Thus I had seemingly attain∣ed a situation of obscurity, secluded from the haunts and intercourse of men. It had however little resemblance to that obscurity to which my imagi∣nation had looked forward with delight, while I was yet in—jail. There is an immeasurable dif∣ference between that rural solitude, where a man rests his head in the lap of verdure and tranquil∣lity; and that retirement in the very seat of action, whose constant attendant is disquietude, and in which a man shrinks with alarm from the eye of his fellow.</P>
<P>I might have thought myself still more secure, if I had been in possession of money upon which to subsist. The necessity of a man's earning for him∣self the means of existence is in most instances a
<PB N="139" REF="028752_0367_0FDBD98EE5B6B578"/>
merely imaginary evil; but in mine certainly tended to thwart the plan of secrecy to which I was condemned. Whatever labour I adopted, or deemed myself qualified to discharge, it was first to be considered how I was to be provided with employment, and where I was to find an employer or purchaser for my commodities. In the mean time I had no alternative. The little money with which I had escaped from the blood-hunters was almost wholly expended.</P>
<P>After the minutest consideration I was able to bestow upon this question, I determined that lite∣rature should be the field of my first experiment. I had read much of money being acquired in this way, and of prices given by the speculators in this sort of ware to its proper manufacturers. My qualifications I estimated at a slender valuation. I was not without a conviction that experience and practice must pave the way to excellent production. But, though of these I was utterly destitute, my propensities had always led me in this direction; and my early thirst of knowledge had conducted me to a more intimate acquaintance with books, than could perhaps have been expected under my circumstances. If my literary pretensions were slight, the demand I intended to make upon them was not great. I only desired a subsistence, and I was persuaded few persons could subsist upon slen∣derer means than myself. I also considered that this was a temporary expedient, necessary only till by accident or time I could place myself in a more eligible situation. The reasons that principally de∣termined me in my choice, were that this employ∣ment called upon me for the least preparation, and could, as I thought, be exercised with least observation.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="028752_0368_0FDBD8D749326E60"/>
There was a solitary woman of middle age, who tenanted a chamber in this house upon the same floor with my own. I had no sooner determined upon the destination of my industry, than I cast my eye upon her as the possible instrument for dis∣posing of my productions. Excluded as I was from all intercourse with my species in general, I found pleasure in the occasional exchange of a few words with this inoffensive and good-humoured creature, who was already of an age to preclude scandal. She lived upon a very small annuity al∣lowed her by a distant relation, a woman of qua∣lity, who, possessed of thousands herself, had no other anxiety with respect to this person, than that she should not contaminate her alliance by the ex∣ertion of honest industry. This humble creature was of a uniformly chearful and active disposition, unacquainted alike with the cares of wealth, and the pressure of misfortune. Though her preten∣sions were small, and her information slender, she was by no means deficient in penetration. She saw the faults and follies of mankind with a judging eye; but her temper was of so mild and forgiving a cast, as would have induced most persons to be∣lieve that she perceived nothing of the matter. Her heart overflowed with the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k of kindness. She was sincere and ardent in her attachments, and never did she omit a service which she per∣ceived herself able to render to a human being. I found her willing and alert to enter into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> I proposed to her. That I might anticipate occasions of suspicion, I frankly told her that, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> reasons which I wished to be excused from relating, but which, if related, I was sure would not de∣prive me of her good opinion, I found it necessary for the present to keep myself private. With this statement she readily acquiesced, and told me that
<PB N="141" REF="028752_0369_0FDBD98FFAEBA228"/>
she had no desire for any farther information than I found it expedient to give.</P>
<P>My first productions were of the poetical kind. After having finished two or three, I directed this generous friend to take them to the office of a news∣paper; but they were rejected with contempt by the Aristarchus of that place, who, having be∣stowed on them a superficial glance, told her that such matters were not at all in his way. I can∣not help mentioning in this place that the counte∣nance of Mrs. Marney (that was the name of my am∣bassadress) was in all cases a perfect indication of her success, and rendered explanation by words wholly unnecessary. She interested herself so un∣reservedly in what she undertook, that she felt either miscarriage or good fortune much more ex∣quisitely than I did. I had an unhesitating confidence in my own resources, and, occupied as I was in the meditation of more interesting concerns, re∣garded these matters as altogether trivial.</P>
<P>I quietly took the pieces back, and laid them upon my table. Upon revisal I altered and tran∣scribed one of them, and, joining it with two others, dispatched them together to the editor of a magazine. He desired they might be left with him till the day after to-morrow. When that day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me, he told my friend they should be inserted; but, Mrs Marney asking respecting the price, he replied, it was their constant rule to give nothing for poetical compositions, the letter-box being al∣ways full of writings of that sort; but, if the gentleman would try his hand in prose, a short essay or a tale, he would see what he could do for him.</P>
<P>With the requisition of my literary dictated I immediately complied. I attempted a paper in the style of Addison's Spectators, which was accepted.
<PB N="142" REF="028752_0370_0FDBD8731449F840"/>
In a short time I was upon an established footing in this quarter. I however distrusted my resources in the way of moral disquisition, and soon turned my thoughts to his other suggestion, a tale. His demands upon me were now frequent, and to faci∣litate my labour I bethought myself of the resource of translation. I had scarcely any convenience with respect to the procuring of books; but, as my memory was very retentive, I frequently trans∣lated or modelled my narratives upon a reading of some years before. By a fatality for which I do not well know how to account, my thoughts fre∣quently led me to the histories of celebrated rob∣bers; and I retailed from time to time incidents and anecdotes of Cartouche, Gusman d'Alfarache, and other memorable worthies, whose career was terminated upon the gallows or the scaffold.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE I was thus endeavouring to occupy and provide for the intermediate period till the vio∣lence of the pursuit after me might be a little abated, a new source of danger opened upon me of which I had no previous suspicion. Jones, the thief who had been expelled from captain Ray∣mond's gang, had fluctuated during the last years of his life, between the two professions of a vio∣lator and a minister of executive justice. I believe he had originally devoted himself to the first, and probably his initiation in the mysteries of thieving qualified him to be peculiarly expert in the pro∣fession of a thief-taker, a profession he had adopted not from choice, but necessity. In this employ∣ment his reputation was great, though perhaps not equal to his merits; for it happens here, as in all other departments of human society, that, however the subalterns may furnish wisdom and skill, the principals run away with the eclat. He was exercising this art in a very prosperous man∣ner, when it happened by some accident, that one or two of his atchievements, previous to his hav∣ing shaken off the dregs of unlicensed depreda∣tion, were in danger of becoming subjects of public attention. Having had repeated intima∣tions of this, he thought it prudent to decamp, and it was during this period of his retreat that he entered into the—gang.</P>
<P>Such was the history of this man antecedently to his being placed in the situation in which I had first encountered him. At the time of that en∣counter
<PB N="144" REF="028752_0372_0FDBD8DE64A3DA30"/>
he was a veteran of Captain Raymond's gang; for, thieves being a short-lived race, the character of veteran costs the less time in acquir∣ing. Upon his expulsion from this community he returned once more to his lawful profession, and by his old comrades was received with congratu∣lation as a lost sheep. In the vulgar classes of society no length of time is sufficient to expiate a crime; but among the fraternity of thief-takers it is a rule never to bring one of their own brethren to a reckoning, when it can with any propriety be avoided. Another rule observed by those who have passed through the same gradations as Jones had done, and which was adopted by Jones him∣self, was always to reserve such as had been the accomplices of their depredations to the last, and on no account to assail them without great neces∣sity or powerful temptation. For this reason Cap∣tain Raymond and his confederates were, according to Jones's system of tactics, safe, as he would have termed it, from his retaliation.</P>
<P>But, though Jones was in this sense of the term a man of strict honour, my case unfortunately did not fall within the laws of honour he acknow∣ledged. Misfortune had overtaken me, and I was on all sides without protection or shelter. The persecution to which I was exposed was founded upon the supposition of my having committed felony to an immense amount. But in this Jones had had no participation; he was careless whether the supposition were true or false, and hated me as much as if my innocence had been established beyond the reach of so much as a whisper of sus∣picion. The blood-hunters who had taken me into custody at—, related, as usual, among their fraternity a part of their adventure, and told of the reason which inclined them to suppose, that
<PB N="145" REF="028752_0373_0FDBD996A9E061F8"/>
the individual who had passed through their custody, was the very Caleb Williams for whose apprehension a reward had been offered of a hun∣dred guineas. Jones, whose acuteness was emi∣nent in the way of his profession, by comparing facts and dates was induced to suspect in his own mind that Caleb Williams was the person he had hustled and wounded upon—forest. Against that person he entertained the bitterest aversion. I had been the innocent occasion of his being ex∣pelled with disgrace from Captain Raymond's gang; and Jones, as I afterwards understood, was inti∣mately persuaded that there was no comparison between the liberal and manly profession of a rob∣ber, from which I had driven him, and the sordid and mechanical occupation of a blood-hunter, to which he was obliged to return. He no sooner received the information I have mentioned, than he vowed revenge. He determined to leave all other objects, and consecrate every faculty of his mind to the unkenneling me from my hiding place. The offered reward, which his vanity made him consider as assuredly his own, appeared as the com∣plete indemnification of his labour and expence. Thus I had to encounter the sagacity he possessed in the way of his profession, whetted and stimu∣lated by a sentiment of vengeance in a mind that knew no restraint from conscience or humanity.</P>
<P>The first step he pursued in execution of his pro∣ject, was to set out for the sea-port town where I had formerly been apprehended. From thence he traced me to the banks of the Severn, and from the banks of the Severn to London. It is scarcely necessary to observe that this is always practicable, unless the precautions of the fugitive be in the highest degree both judicious in the conception and fortunate in the execution,—provided the pur∣suer
<PB N="146" REF="028752_0374_0FDBD8E0F01A8788"/>
have motives strong enough to excite him to perseverance. Jones indeed in the course of his pursuit was often obliged to double his steps; and, like the harrier, an apt emblem of a man engaged in this sanguinary occupation, whenever he was at a fault, returned to the place where he had last perceived the scent of the animal whose death he had decreed. He spared neither pains nor time in the gratification of the passion which choice had made his ruling one.</P>
<P>Upon my arrival in town he for a moment lost all trace of me, London being a place in which, on account of the magnitude of its dimensions, it might well be supposed that an individual could remain hidden and unknown. But no difficulty could discourage this new adversary. He went from inn to inn, reasonably supposing that there was no private house to which I could immediately repair, till he found, by the description he gave, and the sentiments he excited, that I had slept for one night in the borough of Southwark. But he could get no farther information. The people of the inn had no knowledge what had become of me the next morning. This however did but render him more eager in his pursuit. The describing me was now more difficult, on account of the partial change of my dress I had made the second day of my being in town. But Jones at length overcame the obstacle from that quarter. Having traced me to my second inn, he was here furnished with a more copious information. I had been a subject of speculation for the leisure hours of some of the persons belonging to this inn. An old woman of a most curious and loquacious disposition who lived opposite to it, and who that morning rose early to her washing, had espied me from her window by the light of a large lamp which hung over the
<PB N="147" REF="028752_0375_0FDBD99D3A29B5A0"/>
inn, as I issued from the gate. She had but a very imperfect view of me, but she thought there was something Jewish in my appearance. She was ac∣customed to hold a conference every morning with the landlady of the inn, some of the waiters and chambermaids occasionally assisting at it. In the course of the dialogue of this morning she asked some questions about the Jew who had slept there the night before. No Jew had slept there. The curiosity of the landlady was excited in her turn. By the time of the morning it could be no one but me. It was very strange! They compared notes respecting my appearance and dress. No two things could be more dissimilar. The Jew-Chris∣tian, upon any dearth of subjects of intelligence, repeatedly furnished matter for their discourse.</P>
<P>The information thus afforded to Jones, appear∣ed exceedingly material. But the performance did not for some time keep pace with the promise. He could not enter every private house into which lodgers were ever admitted, in the same manner that he had treated the inns. He walked the streets, and examined with a curious and inquisitive eye the countenance of every Jew about my stature; but in vain. He repaired to Duke's Place and the synagogues. It was not here that in reality he could calculate upon finding me; but he resorted to these means in despair and as a last hope. He was more than once upon the point of giving up the pursuit; but he was recalled to it by an insa∣tiable and restless appetite for revenge.</P>
<P>It was during this perturbed and fluctuating state of his mind that he chanced to pay a visit to a brother of his who was the head-workman of a printing-office. There was little intercourse be∣tween these two persons, their dispositions and habits of life being extremely dissimilar. The prin∣ter
<PB N="148" REF="028752_0376_0FDBD945A85DFFE8"/>
was industrious, sober, and of a propensity to accumulation. He was extremely dissatisfied with the character and pursuits of his brother, and had made some ineffectual attempts to reclaim him. But, though they by no means agreed in their ha∣bits of thinking, they sometimes saw each other. Jones loved to boast of as many of his atchieve∣ments as he dared venture to mention; and his brother was one more hearer, in addition to the set of his usual associates. The printer was amused, with the blunt sagacity of remark and novelty of incident that characterised Jones's conversation. He was secretly pleased, in spite of all his sober and church-going prejudices, that he was brother to a man of so much ingenuity and fortitude.</P>
<P>After having listened for some time upon this occasion to the wonderful stories which Jones in his rugged way condescended to tell, the printer felt an ambition to entertain his brother in his turn. He began to retail some of my stories of Cartouche and Gusman d'Alfarache. The attention of Jones was excited. His first emotion was wonder; his second was envy and aversion. Where did the printer get these stories? This question was an∣swered. I will tell you what, said the printer, we none of us know what to make of the writer of these articles. He writes poetry and morality and history: I am a printer and corrector of the press, and may pretend without vanity to be a tolerably good judge of these matters: he writes them all to my mind extremely fine, and yet he is no more than a Jew. [To my honest printer this seemed as strange as if they had been written by a Cherokee chieftain at the falls of the Mississippi.]</P>
<P>A Jew! How do you know? Did you ever see him?</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="028752_0377_0FDBD99E661BFB40"/>
No; the matter is always brought to us by a woman. But my master hates all mysteries; he likes to see his auth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs themselves. So he plagues and plagues the old woman; but he can never get any thing out of her, except that one day she hap∣pened to drop that the young gentleman was a Jew.</P>
<P>A Jew! a young gentleman! a person who did every thing by proxy, and made a secret of all his motions! Here was abundant matter for the spe∣culations and suspicions of Jones. He was con∣firmed in them, without adverting to the process of his own mind, by the subject of my lucubra∣tions, men who died by the hands of the execu∣tioner. He said little more to his brother, except asking, as if casually, what sort of an old woman this was? of what age she might be? and whe∣ther she often brought him materials of this kind? and soon after took occasion to leave him.</P>
<P>It was with vast pleasure that Jones had listened to this unhoped for information. Having col∣lected from his brother sufficient hints relative to the person and appearance of Mrs. Marney, and understanding that he expected to receive some∣thing from me the next day, Jones took his stand in the street early that he might not risk miscarri∣age by negligence. He waited several hours, but not without success. Mrs. Marney came; he watched her into the house; and after about twenty minutes delay saw her return. He dogged her from street to street; observed her finally enter the door of a private house; and congratulated himself upon having at length arrived at the con∣summation of his labours.</P>
<P>The house she entered was not her own habita∣tion. By a sort of miraculous accident she had
<PB N="150" REF="028752_0378_0FDBD9A3AE24B2C8"/>
observed Jones following her in the street. As she went home, she saw a woman who had fallen down in a fainting fit. Moved by the compassion that was ever alive in her, she approached her in order to render her assistance. Presently a crowd collected round them. Mrs. Marney having done what she was able, once more proceeded home∣wards. Observing the crowd round her, the idea of pickpockets occurred to her mind; she put her hands to her sides, and at the same time looked round upon the populace. She had left the circle somewhat abruptly; and Jones, who had been obliged to come nearer lest he should lose her in the confusion, was at that moment standing exactly opposite to her. His visage was of the most ex∣traordinary kind; habit had written the characters of malignant cunning and dauntless effrontery in every line of his face; and Mrs. Marney, who was neither philosopher nor physiognomist, was never∣theless struck. This good woman, like most per∣sons of her notable character, had a peculiar way of going home, not through the open streets, but by narrow lanes and alleys, with intricate in∣sertions and sudden turnings. In one of these by some accident she once again caught a glance of her pursuer. This circumstance, together with the singularity of his appearance, awakened her conjectures. Could he be following her? It was the middle of the day, and she could have no fears for herself. But could this circumstance have any reference to me? She recollected the precau∣tions and secrecy I practised, and had no doubt that I had reasons for what I did. She recol∣lected that she had always been upon her guard respecting me; but had she been sufficiently so? She thought that, if she should be the means of
<PB N="151" REF="028752_0379_0FDBDB154B1EF838"/>
any mischief to me, she should be miserable for ever. She determined therefore by way of pre∣caution in case of the worst, to call at a friend's house, and send me word of what had occurred. Having instructed her friend, she went out imme∣diately upon a visit to a person in the exactly op∣posite direction, and desired her friend to proceed upon the errand to me, five minutes after she left the house. By this prude<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> she completely ex∣tricated me from the present danger.</P>
<P>Meantime the intelligence that was brought me by no means ascertained the greatness of the dan∣ger. For any thing I could discover in it, the cir∣cumstance might be perfectly innocent, and the fear solely proceed from the over caution and kind∣ness of this benevolent and excellent woman. Yet such was the misery of my situation, that I had no choice. For this menace or no menace, I was obliged to desert my habitation at a minute's warn∣ing, taking with me nothing but what I could carry in my hand; to see my generous benefactress no more; to quit my little arrangements and provi∣sion; and to seek once again in some forlorn re∣treat new projects and, if of that I could have any rational hope, a new friend: I descended into the street with a heavy, not an irresolute heart. It was broad day. I said, Persons are at this mo∣ment supposed to be roaming the street in search of me: I must not trust to the chance of their pursuing one direction, and I another. I tra∣versed half a dozen streets, and then dropped into an obscure house of entertainment for persons of small expence. In this house I took some refresh∣ment, passed several hours of active, but melan∣choly thinking, and at last procured a bed. As soon however as it was dark, I went out (for this
<PB N="152" REF="028752_0380_0FDBD9A4ED5C51E8"/>
was indispensable) to purchase the materials of a new disguise. Having adjusted it as well as I could during the night, I left this asylum with the same precautions that I had employed in former instances.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<P>I PROCURED a new lodging. I became more cautious, and went out seldomer than ever. By some bias of the mind it may be, gratifying itself with images of peril, I inclined upon the whole to believe that Mrs. Marney's alarm had not been without foundation. I was however unable to conjecture through what means danger had ap∣proached me; and had therefore only the unsatis∣factory remedy of redoubling my watch upon all my actions. Still I had the joint considerations pressing upon me of security and subsistence. I had some small remains of the produce of my former industry; but this was but small, for my employer was in arrear with me, and I did not choose in any method to apply to him for payment. The anxieties of my mind in spite of all my struggles preyed upon my heath. I did not con∣sider myself as in safety for an instant. My ap∣pearance was wasted to a shadow; and I started at every sound that was unexpected. Sometimes I was half tempted to resign myself into the hands of the law, and brave its worst; but resentment and indignation at those times speedily flowed back upon my mind, and re-animated my perseverance.</P>
<P>I knew no better resource with respect to sub∣sistence, than that I had employed in the former instance, of seeking some third person to stand between me and the disposal of my industry. I might find an individual ready to undertake this office in my behalf, but where should I find the
<PB N="154" REF="028752_0382_0FDBD9ABCF4FA5B0"/>
benevolent soul of Mrs. Marney? The person I fixed upon was a Mr. Spurrel, a man who took in work from the watch-makers, and had an apart∣ment upon our second floor. I examined him two or three times with irresolute glances, as we passed upon the stairs, before I would venture to accost him. He observed this, and at length kindly in∣vited me into his apartment.</P>
<P>Being seated, he condoled with me upon my seeming bad health, and the solitary mode of my living, and wished to know whether he could be of any service to me. From the first moment he saw me, he had conceived an affection for me. In my present disguise I appeared twisted and de∣formed, and in other respects by no means an ob∣ject of attraction. But it seemed, Mr. Spurrel had lost an only son about six months before, and I was the very picture of him. If I had put off my counterfeited ugliness, I should probably have l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st all hold upon his affections. He was now an old man, as he observed, just dropping into the grave, and this son had been his only consolation. The poor lad was always ailing, but he had been a nurse to him; and the more care he required while he was alive, the more he missed him now he was dead. Now he had not a friend, nor any body that cared for him in the whole world. If I pleased, I should be instead of that son to him, and he would treat me in all respects with the same at∣tention and care.</P>
<P>I expressed my sense of these benevolent offers; but told him that I should be sorry to be in any way burthensome to him. My ideas at present led me to a private and solitary life, and my chief dif∣ficulty was to reconcile this with some mode of earning necessary subsistence. If he would con∣descend to lend me his assistance in smoothing this
<PB N="155" REF="028752_0383_0FDBDB1B6690E8D8"/>
difficulty, it would be the greatest benefit he could confer on me. I told him that my mind had al∣ways had a mechanical and industrious turn, and that I did not doubt of soon mastering any craft to which I seriously applied myself. I had not been brought up to any trade; but, if he would favour me with his instructions, I would work with him as long as he pleased for a bare subsistence. I knew that I was asking of him an extraordinary kindness, but I was urged on the one hand by ex∣treme and unmitigable necessity, and encouraged on the other by the persuasiveness of his friendly pro∣fessions.</P>
<P>The old man dropped some tears over my appa∣rent distress, and readily consented to every thing I proposed. Our agreement was soon made, and I entered upon my functions accordingly. My new friend was a man of a singular turn of mind. Love of money and a charitable officiousness of demea∣nour were his leading characteristics. He lived in the most penurious manner, and denied himself almost every indulgence. I entitled myself almost immediately, as he frankly acknowledged, to some remuneration for my labours, and accordingly he insisted upon my being paid. He did not however, as some persons would have done under the cir∣cumstances I have described, pay me the whole amount of my earnings, but professed to subtract from them twenty per cent. as an equitable consi∣deration for instruction and commission-money in procuring me a channel for my industry. Yet he frequently shed tears over me, was uneasy in every moment of our indispensable separation, and exhi∣bited perpetual tokens of attachment and fond∣ness.</P>
<P>I had not been long in this new situation, be∣fore an incident occurred which filled me with
<PB N="156" REF="028752_0384_0FDBD9AD2DA21D18"/>
greater alarm and apprehension than ever. I was walking out one evening for an hour's exercise and air, an indulgence in which I now scarcely ever allowed myself, when my ear was struck with two or three casual sounds from the mouth of a hawker who was bawling his wares. I stood still to inform myself more exactly, when to my utter astonish∣ment and confusion I heard him deliver himself nearly in these words. "Here you have the Most Wonderful and Surprising History, and Miraculous Adventures of Caleb Williams! you are informed how he first robbed, and then brought false accu∣sations against his master; as also of his attempt∣ing divers times to break out of prison, till at last he effected his escape in the most wonderful and uncredible manner; as also of his travelling the kingdom in various disguises, and the robberies he committed with a most desperate and daring gang of thieves; and of his coming up to London, where it is supposed he now lies concealed; with a true and faithful copy of the hue and cry printed and published by one of his majesty's most princi∣pal secretaries of state, offering a reward of one hundred guineas for apprehending him. All for the price of one halfpenny."</P>
<P>Petrified as I was at these amazing and dread∣ful sounds, I had the temerity to go up to the man and purchase one of his papers, desperately resolv∣ed to know the exact state of the fact, and what I had to depend upon. I carried it with me a little way, till, no longer able to endure my impa∣tience, I contrived to make out the chief part of its contents by the help of a lamp, at the upper end of a narrow passage. I found it contain a greater number of circumstances than could have been ex∣pected in this species of publication. I was equal∣led to the most notorious house-breaker in the art
<PB N="157" REF="028752_0385_0FDBDB1CA85C5620"/>
of penetrating through walls and doors, and to the most accomplished swindler in plausibleness, dupli∣city and disguise. The hand-bill which Wilson had first brought to us upon the forest, was printed at length. All my disguises, previously to the last alarm that had been given me by the providence of Mrs. Marney, were faithfully enumerated; and the public was warned to be upon their watch against a person of an uncouth and extraordinary appear∣ance, and who lived in a recluse and solitary manner. I also learned from this paper that my former lodgings had been searched on the very even∣ing of my escape, and that Mrs. Marney had been sent to Newgate upon a charge of misprision of felony.—This last circumstance affected me deeply. It was a most cruel and intolerable idea, if I were not only myself to be an object of unrelenting persecution, but my very touch were to be infec∣tious, and every one that succoured me to be involv∣ed in the common ruin. I could almost have con∣sented to undergo the utmost malice of my ene∣mies, could I by that means have saved this excel∣lent woman from an hour's distress.—I afterwards learned that Mrs. Marney was delivered from con∣finement by the interposition of her noble rela∣tion.</P>
<P>This paper was the consummation of my misfor∣tune. Nothing could happen beyond it but the actual apprehension with which I was menaced. Disguise was no longer of use to me. A nume∣rous class of individuals, through every depart∣ment, almost every house of the metropolis, would be induced to look with a suspicious eye upon eve∣ry stranger, especially every solitary stranger, that fell under their observation. The prize of one hundred guineas was held out to excite their cu∣pidity, and sharpen their penetration. It was no longer Bow-Street, it was a million of men, in
<PB N="158" REF="028752_0386_0FDBD9B32BE3CB48"/>
arms against me. Neither had I the refuge, which few men have been so miserable as to want, of one single individual with whom to repose my alarms, and who might shelter me from the gaze of indis∣criminate curiosity. I instantly saw that London was no place for my abode, at the same time that I apprehended increase of peril in any attempt to withdraw from it. I resolved however that I would no longer submit to this state of terrific alarm. I resolved that I would not remain quiescent, till mis∣chief should overtake and devour me. I could scarcely reduce things to a more miserable pass. "To be worse than this, were not to be at all."</P>
<P>Filled with reflections of this nature, I careful∣ly and deliberately destroyed the paper I had been reading, by tearing it in a thousand pieces. I did not return home, but went instantly to the water∣side. I found that the cheapest passage I could procure was in a vessel, moored near the Tower, and which was to sail in a few days for Middleburg in Holland. I would have gone instantly on board and endeavoured to prevail with the captain to let me remain there till he sailed; but that unfortu∣nately I had not money enough in my pocket to defray my passage. It was worse than this. I had not money enough in the world. I however paid the captain half his demand, and promised to re∣turn with the rest. I knew not in what manner it was to be procured, but I believed that I would not fail to procure it. I had some idea of borrow∣ing it of Mr. Spurrel. Surely he would not re∣fuse me? He appeared to love me with parental affection, and I thought I might trust myself for a moment in his hands.</P>
<P>I approached my own home with a heavy and foreboding heart. Mr. Spurrel was not at home; and I was obliged to wait for his return. I had
<PB N="159" REF="028752_0387_0FDBDB1E28D9FA30"/>
work of his in my trunk, which had been deliver∣ed out to me that very morning, to five times the amount I wanted. I even canvassed for a moment whether I should make use of this pro∣perty as if it were my own; but I rejected the idea with disdain. I had never in the smallest degree merited the reproaches that were cast upon me; and I was determined I never would merit them. It was extraordinary that Mr. Spurrel should be abroad at this hour; I had never known it happen before. His bed-time was between nine and ten. Ten o'clock came, eleven o'clock, but not Mr. Spurrel. At midnight I heard his knock at the door. Every soul in the house was in bed. Mr. Spurrel, on account of his regular hours, was un∣provided with a key to open for himself. A gleam of gaiety and the social spirit came over my heart. I flew nimbly down the stairs, and opened the door to him myself.</P>
<P>I could perceive by the little taper in my hand something extraordinary written in his counte∣nance. I had not time to speak, before I saw two other men follow him. At the first glance I was sufficiently assured what sort of persons they were. At the second I perceived that one of them was no other than Jones himself. I had understood formerly that he had been of this profession, and I was not much surprised to find him in it again. Though I had for some hours made up my mind as it were, to the unavoidable necessity of my once more falling into the hands of the officers of law, yet I could not see them enter without feeling my very heart ache in my bosom. I was beside not a little surprised at the time and manner of their en∣trance, and desirous to learn whether Mr. Spurrel could be base enough to have been their intro∣ducer.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="028752_0388_0FDBD9B32E51A2B0"/>
I was not long held in perplexity. He no sooner saw his two followers properly within the door, than he exclaimed with convulsive eagerness, There, there, that is your man! thank God! thank God! Jones looked eagerly in my face, with a counte∣nance expressive alternately of hope and doubt, and answered, By G—, and I do not know whether it be or no! I am afraid we are in the wrong box! then recollecting himself, We will go into the house, and examine farther however. We all went up stairs in∣to Mr. Spurrel's room; I set down the candle upon the table. I had hitherto been silent; but now, with a calm and deliberate manner, in my feigned voice, one of the characteristics of which was lisping, I asked, And pray, gentlemen, what may be your pleasure with me? Why, said Jones, our errand is with one Caleb Williams, and a precious rascal he is! I ought to know the chap well enough; but they say he has as many faces as there are days in the year. So you please to pull off your face; or if you cannot do that, at least you can put off your clothes, and let us see what your hump is made of.</P>
<P>I remonstrated, but in vain. I stood detected in part of my artifice; and Jones, though still un∣certain, was every moment more and more con∣firmed in his suspicions. Mr. Spurrel perfectly gloted, with eyes that seemed ready to devour eve∣ry thing that passed. As my imposture gradually appeared more palpable, he repeated his exclama∣tion, Thank God! thank God! At last, tired with this scene of mummery, and disgusted beyond measure with the base and hypocritical figure I seemed to exhibit, I exclaimed, Well, I am Caleb Williams; conduct me wherever you please! And now, Mr. Spurrel—! He gave a violent start. The instant I declared myself his transport had
<PB N="161" REF="028752_0389_0FDBDB23D4846930"/>
been at the highest, and was, to any power he was able to exert, absolutely uncontroulable. But the unexpectedness of my address, and the tone in which I spoke, electrified him.—Is it possible, continued I, that you should have been the wretch to betray me? What had I done to deserve this treatment? Is this the kindness you professed? the affection that was perpetually in your mouth? to be the death of me!</P>
<P>My poor boy! my dear creature! cried Spurrel, whimpering, and in a tone of the humblest expos∣tulation, indeed I could not help it! I would have helped it, if I could! I hope they will not hurt my darling! I am sure, I shall die if they do!</P>
<P>Miserable driveller! interrupted I, with a stern voice, do you betray me into the gore-dripping fangs of the law, and then talk of my not being hurt? I know my sentence, and am prepared to meet it! You have fixed the halter upon my neck, and at the same price would have done so to your only son! Go, count your accursed guineas! My life would have been safer in the hands of one I had never seen, than in yours, whose mouth and whose eyes for ever ran over with crocodile affec∣tion!</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV.</HEAD>
<P>SAYING this, I left him with ineffable con∣tempt, unable to utter a word. Jones and his com∣panion attended me. It is unnecessary to repeat all the insolence of this man. He alternately tri∣umphed in the completion of his revenge, and re∣gretted the loss of the reward to the shrivelled old curmudgeon we had just quitted, whom however he swore he would cheat of it, if he could. He equally regretted the imperfect way in which his skill had been cut off; boastfully recounting how he had ferreted me thus far, and bitterly lamenting that the whole had not been left to him, which in a day or two he would infallibly have accom∣plished.</P>
<P>I paid but little attention to his story. It struck upon my sense, and I was able to recollect it at my nearest leisure, though I thought not of it at the time. For the present I was busily employed reflecting on my new situation, and the conduct to be observed in it. My prospects were particu∣larly gloomy and discouraging. How much labour had I exerted, first to extricate myself from prison, and next to evade the diligence of my pursuers; and the result of all, after months of anxiety and diligence, was, to be brought back to the point from which I began! I had gained fame indeed, the miserable fame to have my story bawled forth by hawkers and ballad-mongers, to have my praises as an active and surprising villain celebrated among
<PB N="163" REF="028752_0391_0FDBDB266DBAF860"/>
footmen and chambermaids; but I was neither an Erostratus nor an Alexander, to die contented with that species of eulogium. With respect to all that was solid and desirable, what chance could I ascribe to new exertions of a similar nature; which, if undertaken at all, must be undertaken with infi∣nitely more unfavourable auspices?</P>
<P>They were considerations like these that dictated my resolution. My mind had been gradually weaning from Mr. Falkland, till its feelings rose to something like abhorrence. I had long cherished a reverence for him, which not even animosity and persecution on his part could readily destroy. But I now ascribed a character so inhumanly sanguinary to his mind; I saw something so fiend-like in the thus hunting me round the world, and determining to be satisfied with nothing less than my blood, while at the same time he knew my innocence, my innoxiousness, nay I might add my virtues; that henceforth I trampled reverence and the recollec∣tion of former esteem under my feet. I lost all regard to his intellectual greatness, and all pity for the torture and agonies of his soul. I also would abjure forbearance. I would show myself bitter and inflexible as he had done. Was it wise in him to compel me into extremity and madness? Had he no fears for his own secret and atrocious of∣fences?</P>
<P>I went before the magistrates to whose office Jones and his comrade conducted me, fully deter∣mined to publish those astonishing secrets, of which I had hitherto been the faithful depository; and once for all to turn the tables upon my accuser. It was time that the real criminal should be the suf∣ferer, and not that innocence should for ever labour under the oppression of guilt. I had been obliged to spend the remainder of the night upon which I
<PB N="164" REF="028752_0392_0FDBDAD760F52628"/>
had been apprehended in prison. During the in∣terval I had thrown off every vestige of disguise, and appeared the next morning in my own person. I was of course easily identified; and, this being the whole with which the magistrates before whom I now stood thought themselves concerned, they were proceeding to make out an order for my being conducted back to my own county. I suspended the dispatch of this measure by observing that I had something to disclose. This is an overture to which men appointed for the administration of cri∣minal justice never fail to attend.</P>
<P>I said that I had always protested my innocence, and must now repeat the protest.</P>
<P>In that case, retorted the senior magistrate ab∣ruptly, what can you have to disclose? If you are innocent, that is no business of ours! We act officially.</P>
<P>I always declared, continued I, that I was the perpetrator of no guilt, but that the guilt wholly belonged to my accuser. He privately conveyed these effects among my property, and then charged me with the robbery. I now declare more than that, that this man is a MURDERER, that I de∣tected his criminality, and that for that reason he is determined to deprive me of life. I presume, gentlemen, that you do consider it as your business to take this declaration. I am persuaded you will be by no means disposed actively or passively to contribute to the atrocious injustice under which I suffer, to the imprisonment and condemnation of an innocent man in order that a murderer may go free. I suppressed this story as long as I could. I was extremely averse to be the author of the un∣happiness or the death of a human being. But all patience and submission have their limits.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="028752_0393_0FDBDB27EF0E6EB8"/>
Give me leave, sir, rejoined the magistrate with an air of affected moderation, to ask you two ques∣tions. Were you any way aiding, abetting, or contributing to this murder?</P>
<P>No.</P>
<P>And pray, sir, who is this Mr. Falkland, and what may have been the nature of your connection with him?</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland is a gentleman of six thousand per annum. I lived with him as his secretary.</P>
<P>In other words you were his servant?</P>
<P>As you please.</P>
<P>Very well, sir, that is quite enough for me. First I have to tell you as a magistrate, that I can have nothing to do with your declaration. If you had been concerned in the murder you talk of, that would alter the case. But it is out of all reasona∣ble rule for a magtstrate to take an information from a felon, except against his accomplices. Next I think it right to observe to you in my own pro∣per person, that you appear to me to be the most impudent rascal I ever saw. Why, are you such an ass as to suppose, that the sort of story you have been telling, can be of any service to you, either here, or at the assizes, or any where else? A fine time of it indeed it would be, if, when gentle∣men of six thousand a year take up their servants for robbing them, those servants could trump up such accusations as these, and could get any ma∣gistrate or court of justice to listen to them! Whe∣ther or no the felony with which you stand charged would have brought you to the gallows, I will not pretend to say. But I am sure this story will. There would be a speedy end to all order and good government, if fellows that trample upon ranks and distinctions in this atrocious sort, were upon any consideration suffered to get off.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="028752_0394_0FDBDAD9F0943BC8"/>
And do you refuse, sir, to attend to the particu∣lars of the charge I alledge?</P>
<P>Yes, sir, I do.—But, if I did not, pray what witnesses have you of the murder?</P>
<P>This question staggered me.</P>
<P>None.—But I believe I can make out a circum∣stantial proof of a nature to force attention from the most indifferent hearer.</P>
<P>I thought so.—Officers, take him from the bar.</P>
<P>Such was the success of this ultimate resort on my part, upon which I had built with such un∣doubting confidence. Till now I had conceived that the unfavourable situation in which I was placed was prolonged by my own forbearance; and I was determined to endure all that human na∣ture could support, rather than have recourse to this extreme recrimination. That idea secretly con∣soled me under all my calamities: a voluntary sa∣crifice is chearfully made. I regarded myself as allied to the army of martyrs and confessors; I applauded my own fortitude and self-denial; and I pleased myself with the idea, that I had the power, though I hoped never to employ it, by an unrelenting display of all my resources to put an end at once to my sufferings and persecutions.</P>
<P>And this at last was the justice of mankind. A man under certain circumstances shall not be heard in the detection of a crime, because he has not been a participator of it! The story of a flagitious mur∣der shall be listened to with indifference, while an innocent man is hunted like a wild beast to the far∣thest corners of the earth! Six thousand a year shall protect a man from accusation; and the va∣lidity of an impeachment shall be superseded, be∣cause the author of it is a servant!</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="028752_0395_0FDBDB2E0C754CF0"/>
I was conducted back to the very prison from which a few months before I had made my escape. My prospects were more gloomy, and my situation apparently more irremediable than ever. I was ex∣posed again, if that were of any account, to the insolence and tyranny that are uniformly exercised within those walls. Why should I repeat the loath∣some tale of all that was endured by me, and is en∣dured by every man who is unhappy enough to fall under the government of these consecrated ministers of national jurisprudence? The sufferings I had already experienced, my anxieties, my flight, the perpetual expectation of being discovered, worse than the discovery itself, would perhaps have been enough to satisfy the most insensible individual in the court of his own conscience, if I had even been the felon I was pretended to be. But the law has neither eyes, nor ears, nor bowels of humanity; and it turns into marble the hearts of all those that are nursed in its principles.</P>
<P>Yet I was not cast down. I resolved that, while I had life, I would never despair. Op∣pressed, annihilated I might be; but if I died, I would die resisting. What use, what advantage, what pleasurable sentiment could arise from a tame surrender? There is no man that is ignorant, that to humble yourself at the feet of the law is a bootless task; in her courts there is no room for amendment and reformation.</P>
<P>My fortitude may to some persons appear above the standard of human nature. But, if I draw back the veil from my heart, they will readily con∣fess their mistake. My heart bled at every pore. My resolution was not the calm sentiment of phi∣losophy and reason. It was a gloomy and desperate purpose; the creature, not of hope, but of a mind austerely held to its design, that thought itself sa∣tisfied
<PB N="168" REF="028752_0396_0FDBDADBD7961600"/>
with the naked effort, and prepared to give success or miscarriage to the winds. It was to this miserable condition, which might awaken sympa∣thy in the most hardened bosom, that Mr. Falk∣land had reduced me.</P>
<P>I anticipated the event of my trial. I was deter∣mined once more to escape from my prison, nor did I doubt of my ability to effect at least this first step towards my future preservation. The assizes, how∣ever, were near, and there were certain considera∣tions, unnecessary to be detailed, that persuaded me there might be benefit in waiting till my trial should actually be terminated, before I made my attempt. It stood upon the list as one of the latest to be brought forward. I was therefore extremely surprised to find it called out of its order early on the morning of the second day. But, if this were unexpected, how much greater was my astonish∣ment, when my prosecutor was called, to find nei∣ther Mr. Falkland nor Mr. Forester, nor a single individual of any description appear against me! The recognizances into which my prosecutors had entered were ordered to be forfeited, and I was dismissed without further impediment from the bar.</P>
<P>The effect which this incredible reverse produced upon my mind was as if I had fallen from the ele∣vation of the most distant planet in the system upon our earth in a moment. I, who had come to that bar with the sentence of death already in idea ring∣ing in my ears, to be told that I was free to tran∣sport myself whithersoever I pleased! Was it for this that I had broken through so many locks, and bolts, and the adamantine walls of my prison; that I had passed so many anxious days, and sleepless, spectre∣haunted nights; that I had racked my invention for expedients of evasion and concealment; that
<PB N="169" REF="028752_0397_0FDBDB32979E14E0"/>
my mind had been roused to an energy of which I could scarcely have believed it capable; that my existence had been enthralled to an ever-living tor∣ment such as I could hardly have supposed it in man to endure? Great God! what is man? Is he thus blind to the future, thus totally unsuspecting of what is to occur in the next moment of his ex∣istence? I have somewhere read that heaven in mercy hides from us the future incidents of our life. My own experience does not well accord with this assertion. In this instance at least I should have been saved from insupportable labour and unde∣scribable anguish, could I have foreseen the catas∣trophe of this most interesting transaction.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI.</HEAD>
<P>IT was not long before I took my everlasting leave of this detested and miserable scene. My heart was for the present too full of astonishment and exulta∣tion in this unexpected deliverance, to admit of anxi∣ety about the future. I withdrew from the town. I rambled with a slow and thoughtful pace, now bursting with exclamation, and now buried in pro∣found and undefinable reverie. Accident led me towards the very heath which had first sheltered me, when upon a former occasion I broke out of my prison. I wandered among its cavities and its vallies. It was a forlorn and desolate solitude. I continued here I know not how long. Night at length overtook me unperceived, and I prepared to return for the present to the town I had quitted.</P>
<P>It was now perfectly dark, when two men whom I had not previously observed sprung upon me from behind. They seized me by the arms, and threw me upon the ground. I had no time for re∣sistance or recollection. I could however perceive that one of them was the diabolical Jones. They blindfolded, gagged me, and hurried me I knew not whither. As we passed along in silence, I en∣deavoured to conjecture what could be the meaning of this extraordinary violence. I was strongly im∣pressed with the idea that, after the event of this morning, the most severe and painful part of my history was past; nor could I persuade myself to shrink with alarm at this unexpected attack. It
<PB N="171" REF="028752_0399_0FDBDB341A6942D0"/>
might however be some new project suggested by the brutal unrelenting temper and animosity of Jones.</P>
<P>I presently found that we were returned into the town I had just quitted. They led me into a house, and, as soon as they had taken possession of a room, freed me from the restraints they had before im∣posed. Here Jones informed me with a malicious grin, that no harm was intended me, and there∣fore I should show most sense in keeping myself quiet. I perceived that we were in an inn; I over∣heard company in a room at no great distance from us, and therefore was myself as thoroughly aware as he could be, that there was at present little rea∣son to stand in fear of any species of violence, and that it would be time enough to resist, when they attempted to conduct me from the inn in the same manner that they had brought me into it. I was not without some curiosity to see the conclusion that was to follow upon so extraordinary a commence∣ment.</P>
<P>The preliminaries I have described were scarcely completed, before Mr. Falkland entered the room. I remember Collins, when he first communicated to me the particulars of our patron's history, observed that he was totally unlike the man he had once been. I had no means of ascertaining the truth of that observation. But it was strikingly applicable to the spectacle which now presented itself to my eyes, though, when I last beheld this unhappy man, he had been a victim to the same passions, a prey to the same undying remorse as now. Misery was at that time inscribed in legible characters upon his countenance. But now he appeared like nothing that had ever been visible in human shape. His visage was haggard, emaciated, and fleshless. His complexion was a dun and tarnished red, the co∣lour uniform through every region of the face, and
<PB N="172" REF="028752_0400_0FDBDAE2782C7A58"/>
suggested the idea of its being burnt and parched by the eternal fire that burned within him. His eyes were red, quick, wandering, full of suspicion and rage. His hair was neglected, ragged, and float∣ing. His whole figure was thin to a degree that suggested the idea rather of a skeleton than a per∣son actually alive. Life seemed hardly to be the capable inhabitant of so woe-begone and ghost-like a figure. The taper of wholesome life was ex∣pired; but passion and fierceness and frenzy were able for the present to supply its place.</P>
<P>I was to the utmost degree astonished and shocked at the sight of him.—He sternly commanded my conductors to leave the room</P>
<P>Well, sir, I have this day successfully exerted myself to save your life from the gallows. A fort∣night ago you did what you were able to bring my life to that ignominious close.</P>
<P>Were you so stupid and undistinguishing as not to know that the preservation of your life was the uniform object of my exertions? Did not I main∣tain you in prison? Did not I endeavour to prevent your being sent thither? Could you mistake the bigoted and obstinate conduct of Forester in offer∣ing a hundred guineas for your apprehension for mine?</P>
<P>I had my eye-upon you in all your wanderings. You have taken no material step through their whole course with which I have not been acquaint∣ed. I meditated to do you good. I have spilled no blood but that of Tyrrell: that was in the mo∣ment of passion, and it has been the subject of my uninterrupted and hourly remorse. I have con∣nived at no man's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate but that of the Hawkinses: they could no otherwise have been saved than by acknowledging myself a murderer. The rest of my life has all been spent in acts of benevolence. I
<PB N="173" REF="028752_0401_0FDBDB38EF7E7E38"/>
meditated to do you good. For that reason I was willing to prove you. You pretended to act towards me with consideration and forbearance. If you had persisted in that to the end, I would yet have found a way to reward you I left you to your own discretion. You might show the impo∣tent malignity of your own heart, but in the cir∣cumstances in which you were then placed I knew you could not hurt me. Your forbearance has proved, as I all along suspected, empty and treach∣erous. You have attempted to blast my reputation. You have sought to disclose the select and eternal secret of my soul. Because you have done that, I will never forgive you. I will remember it to my latest breath. The memory shall survive me, when my existence is no more. Do you think you are out of the reach of my power, because a court of justice has acquitted you?</P>
<P>While Mr. Falkland was speaking, a sudden dis∣temper came over his countenance, his whole frame was shaken by an instantaneous convulsion, and he staggered to a chair. In about three minutes he re∣covered.</P>
<P>Yes, said he, I am still alive. I shall live for days and months and years; the power that made me, of whatever kind it be, can only determine how long. I live the guardian of my reputation. That, and to endure a misery such as man never endured, are the only ends to which I live. But, when I am no more, my fame shall still survive. My character shall be revered, as spotless and un∣impeachable by all posterity, as long as the name of Falkland shall be repeated in the most distant region of the many-peopled globe.</P>
<P>Having said this, he retu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ned to the discourse which more immediately related to my future con∣dition and happiness.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="028752_0402_0FDBDAE5EB6490F8"/>
There is one condition, said he, upon which you may obtain some mitigation of your future ca∣lamity. It is for that purpose that I have sent for you. Listen to my proposals with deliberation and sobriety! Remember, that the insanity is not less to trifle with the resolved determination of my soul, than it would be to pull a mountain upon your head that hung trembling upon the edge of the mighty Appenine!</P>
<P>I insist then upon your signing a paper declaring in the most solemn manner that I am innocent of murder, and that the charge you alleged at the of∣fice in Bow-street is false, malicious and ground∣less. Perhaps you may scruple out of a regard to truth. Is truth then entitled to adoration for its own sake, and not for the sake of the happiness it is calculated to produce? Will a reasonable man sacrifice to barren truth, when benevolence, huma∣nity and every consideration that is dear to the hu∣man heart require that it should be superseded! It is probable that I may never make use of this pa∣per, but I require it as the only practicable repara∣tion to the honour you have assailed. This is what I had to propose. I expect your answer.</P>
<P>Sir, answered I, I have heard you to an end, and I stand in need of no deliberation to enable me to answer you in the negative. You took me up a raw and inexperienced boy, capable of being moulded to any form you pleased. But you have communicated to me volumes of experience in a very short period. I am no longer irresolute and pliable. What is the power you retain over my fate I am unable to discover. You may destroy me; but you cannot make me tremble. I am not concerned to enquire whether what I have suffered flowed from you by design or otherwise, whether you were the author of my miseries or only con∣nived
<PB N="175" REF="028752_0403_0FDBDB3CE7FD4630"/>
at them. This I know, that I have suffered too exquisitely on your account, for me to feel the least remaining claim on your part to my making any voluntary sacrifice.</P>
<P>You say that benevolence and humanity require this sacrifice of me. No. It would only be a sa∣crifice to your mad and misguided love of fame, to that passion which has been the source of all your miseries, of the most tragical calamities to others, and of every misfortune that has hap∣pened to me. I have no forbearance to exercise towards that passion. If you be not yet cured of this tremendous and sanguinary folly, at least I will do nothing to cherish it. I know not whether from my youth I was destined for a hero; but I may thank you for having taught me a lesson of insurmountable fortitude.</P>
<P>What is it that you require of me? That I should sign away my own reputation for the better maintaining of yours. Where is the equality of that? What is it that casts me at such an immense distance below you, as to make every thing that relates to me wholly unworthy of consideration? You have been educated in the prejudice of birth. I abhor that prejudice. You have made me des∣perate, and I utter what that desperation suggests.</P>
<P>You will tell me perhaps that I have no repu∣tation to lose, that, while you are esteemed fault∣less and unblemished, I am universally reputed a thief, a suborner and a calumniator. Be it so. I will never do any thing to countenance those im∣putations. The more I am destitute of the esteem of mankind, the more careful I will be to preserve my own. I will never from fear or any other mistaken motive do any thing of which I ought to be ashamed.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="028752_0404_0FDBDAEEEB8B3398"/>
You are determined to be for ever my enemy. I have in no degree deserved this eternal abhor∣rence. I have always esteemed and pitied you. For a considerable time I rather chose to expose myself to every kind of misfortune, than disclose the secret that was so dear to you. I was not de∣terred by your menaces, (What could you make me suffer more than I actually suffered?) but by the humanity of my own heart; in which, and not in means of violence, you ought to have re∣posed your confidence. What is the mysterious vengeance that you can yet execute against me? You menaced me before; you can menace no worse now. You are wearing out the springs of terror. Do with me as you please! You teach me to hear you with an unshrinking and desperate firmness. Recollect yourself! I did not proceed to the act with which you reproach me till I was apparently urged to the very last extremity. I am now sorry that that step was ever adopted. But it seemed that I was treated with unrelenting rigour; and, urged to exasperation by unintermitted suffer∣ings, I had no time to cool or to deliberate. Even at present I cherish no vengeance against you. All that is reasonable, all that can really contribute to your security, I will readily concede; but I will not be driven to an act repugnant to all reason, integrity, and justice.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland listened to me with astonishment and impatience. He had entertained no previous conception of the firmness I displayed. Several times he was convulsed with the fury that laboured in his breast. Once and again he betrayed an in∣tention to interrupt; but he was restrained by the collectedness of my manner, and perhaps by a de∣sire to be acquainted with the entire state of my mind. Finding that I had concluded, he paused
<PB N="177" REF="028752_0405_0FDBDB3E719D08D8"/>
for a moment; his passion seemed gradually to en∣large, till it was no longer capable of controul.</P>
<P>It is well! said he, gnashing his teeth, and stamping upon the ground. You refuse the com∣position I offer! I have no power to persuade you to compliance! You defy me! At least I have a power respecting you, and that power I will exer∣cise; a power that shall grind you into atoms. I condescend to no more expostulation. I know what I am, and what I can be. I know what you are, and what fate is reserved for you!</P>
<P>Saying this he quitted the room.</P>
<P>Such were the particulars of this memorable scene. The impression it has left upon my under∣standing is indelible. The figure and appearance of Mr. Falkland, his death-like weakness and de∣cay, his more than mortal energy and rage, the words that he spoke, the motives that animated him, produced one compounded effect upon my mind that nothing of the same nature could ever parallel. The idea of his misery thrilled through my frame. How weak in comparison of it is the imaginary hell, which the great enemy of man∣kind is represented as carrying every where about with him!</P>
<P>From this consideration my mind presently turned to the menaces he had vented against my∣self. They were all mysterious and undefined. He had talked of power, but had given no hint from which I could collect in what he imagined it to consist. He had talked of misery, but had not dropped a syllable respecting the nature of the mi∣sery to be inflicted.</P>
<P>I sat still for some time ruminating on these thoughts. Neither Mr. Falkland, nor any other person appeared, to disturb my meditations. I rose, went out of the room, and from the inn
<PB N="178" REF="028752_0406_0FDBDAF1197113A8"/>
into the street. No one offered to molest me. It was strange! What was the nature of this power from which I was to apprehend so much, yet which seemed to leave me at perfect liberty? I began to imagine that all I had heard from this dreadful adversary was mere madness and extra∣vagance, that he was at length deprived of the use of reason, which had long served him only as a medium of torment. Yet was it likely in that case that he should be able to employ Jones and his associate, who had just been his instruments of violence upon my person?</P>
<P>I proceeded along the streets with considerable caution. I looked before me and behind me, as well as the darkness would allow me to do, that I might not again be hunted in sight by some man of stratagem and violence without my perceiving it. I was not as before beyond the limits of the town, but considered the streets, the houses and the in∣habitants as affording some degree of security. I was still walking with my mind thus full of sus∣picion and forecast, when I discovered Thomas, that servant of Mr. Falkland whom I have already more than once had occasion to mention. He advanced towards me with an air so blunt and di∣rect, as instantly to remove from me the idea of any thing insidious in his purpose; beside that I had always felt the character of Thomas, rustic and uncultivated as it was, to be entitled to a more than common proportion of esteem.</P>
<P>Thomas, said I, as he advanced, I hope you are willing to give me joy that I am at length delivered from the dreadful danger which for many months haunted me so unmercifully.</P>
<P>No, rejoined Thomas roughly, I be not at all willing. I do not know what to make of my∣self
<PB N="179" REF="028752_0407_0FDBDB40212ED7B0"/>
in this affair. While you were in prison in that miserable fashion, I felt all at one almost as if I loved you: and, now that that is over, and you are turned out loose in the world to do your worst, my blood rises at the very sight of you. To look at you, you are almost that very lad Williams for whom I could with pleasure as it were have laid down my life; and yet behind that smiling face there lie robbery▪ and lying, and eve∣ry thing that is ungrateful and murderous Your last action was worse than all the rest How could you find in your heart to revive that cruel story about Mr. Tyrrel, which every body had agreed out of regard to the squire never to mention again, and of which I know and you know he is as innocent as the child unborn? There are causes and reasons, or else I could have wished from the bottom of my soul never to have set eyes on you again!</P>
<P>And you still persist in your hard thoughts of me!</P>
<P>Worse! I think worse of you than ever! Be∣fore, I thought you as bad as man could be. I wonder from my soul what you are to do next. But you make good the old saying, When a man is once in—.</P>
<P>And so there is never to be an end of my mis∣fortunes. What can Mr. Falkland contrive for me worse than the ill opinion and enmity of all man∣kind?</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland contrive! He is the best friend you have in the world, though you are the basest trai∣tor to him. Poor man! it makes one's heart ache to look at him; he is the very image of grief. And it is not clear to me that it is not all owing to you. At least you have given the finishing blow in behalf of the diseasethat already had him in its clutches. There have been the devil and all to pay
<PB N="180" REF="028752_0408_0FDBDAF65373CC20"/>
between him and squire Forester. The squire is right raving mad with my master, for having out∣witted him in the matter of the trial, and saved your life. He swears that you shall be taken up and tried all over again at the next assizes; but my master is so resolute, that I believe he will carry it his own way. To see him ordering every thing for your benefit, and taking all your maliciousness as mild and innocent as a lamb, and then to think of your vile proceedings against him, is a sight one shall not see again, if one was to go all the world over. For God's sake, repent of your reprobate doings, and make what little reparation is in your power! Think of your poor soul, before you awake, as to be sure one of these days you will, in fire and brimstone everlasting!</P>
<P>Saying this, he held out his hand, and took hold of mine. The action seemed strange, but I at first thought of it as the unpremeditated result of his solemn and well-intended adjuration. I felt however that he put something into my hand. The next moment he quitted his hold, and hastened from me with the swiftness of an arrow. What he had thus given me was a bank-note of twenty pounds. I had no doubt that he had been charged to deliver it to me from Mr. Falkland.</P>
<P>What was I to infer? What light did it throw upon the intentions of my inexorable persecutor? His animosity against me was as great as ever; that I had just had confirmed to me from his own mouth. Yet his animosity appeared to be still tempered with the remains of humanity. He prescribed to it a line wide enough to embrace the gratifica∣tion of his views, and within the boundaries of that line it stopped. But this discovery carried no consolation to my mind. I knew not what portion of calamity I was fated to endure, before his jealousy
<PB N="181" REF="028752_0409_0FDBDB46AFA4A3D8"/>
of dishonour and inordinate thirst of fame would deem themselves satisfied.</P>
<P>Another question offered itself. Was I to receive the money which had just been put into my hands? the money of a man, who had inflicted upon me injuries, less than those which he had entailed up∣on himself, but the greatest that one man can in∣flict upon another? who had blasted my youth, who had destroyed my peace, who had held me up to the abhorrence of mankind, and rendered me an outcast upon the face of the earth? who had forged of me the basest and most atrocious falseshoods, and urged them with a seriousness and perseve∣rance which produced universal belief? who an hour before had vowed against me inexorable en∣mity, and sworn to entail upon me misery without end? Would not this conduct on my part betray a base and abject spirit, that crouched under tyran∣ny, and kissed the hands that were embrued in my blood?</P>
<P>If these reasons appeared strong, neither was the other side without reasons in reply. I wanted the money: not for any purpose of vice or super∣fluity, but for those purposes without which life cannot subsist. Man ought to be able, wherever placed, to find for himself the means of existence: but I was to open a new scene of life, to remove to some distant spot, to be prepared against the ill∣will of mankind, and the unexplored projects of hostility of a most accomplished foe. The actual means of existence are the property of all. What should hinder me from taking that of which I was really in want, when in taking it I risked no ven∣geance and perpetrated no violence? The property in question will be beneficial to me, and the volun∣tary surrender of it is accompanied with no injury to its late proprietor; what other condition can be
<PB N="182" REF="028752_0410_0FDBDAFA2D223EB8"/>
necessary to render the use of it on my part a duty? He that lately possessed it has injured me; does that alter its value as a medium of exchange? He will boast perhaps of the imaginary obligation he has conferred on me: Surely to shrink from a thing in itself right, from any such apprehension, can be the result only of pusillanimity and cowar∣dice.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII.</HEAD>
<P>INFLUENCED by these reasonings, I determin∣ed to retain what had thus been put into my hands. My next care was in regard to the scene I should choose as the retreat of that life which I had just saved from the grasp of the executioner. The danger to which I was exposed of forcible interrup∣tion in my pursuits was probably in some respects less now, than it had been previously to this crisis. Beside, that I was considerably influenced in this deliberation by the strong loathing I conceived for the situations in which I had lately been engaged. I knew not in what mode Mr. Falkland intended to exercise his vengeance against me; but I was seized with so unconquerable an aversion to disguise and the idea of spending my life in the personating a fictitious character, that I could not for the present at least reconcile my mind to any thing of that na∣ture. The same kind of disgust I had conceived for the metropolis, where I had spent so many hours of artifice and terror. I therefore decided in favour of the project which had formerly prov∣ed amusing to my imagination, of withdrawing to some distant, rural scene, a scene of calmness and obscurity, where for a few years at least, perhaps during the life of Mr. Falkland, I might be hidden from the world, recover the wounds my mind had received in this fatal connexion, metho∣dise and improve the experience which had been accumulated, cultivate the faculties I in any degree possessed, and employ the intervals of these occu∣pations
<PB N="184" REF="028752_0412_0FDBDAFF422D28D0"/>
in simple industry and the intercourse of guileless, uneducated, kind-intentioned minds. The menaces of my persecutor seemed to forebode the inevitable interruption of this system. But I deem∣ed it wise to put these menaces out of my consi∣deration. I compared them to death, which must infallibly overtake us, we know not when; but the possibility of whose arrival next year, next week, to-morrow, must be left out of the calculation of him who would enter upon any important or well∣concerted undertaking.</P>
<P>Such were the ideas that determined my choice. Thus did my youthful mind delineate the system of distant years, even when the threats of instant calamity still sounded in my ears. I was inured to the apprehension of mischief, till at last the hoarse roarings of the beginning tempest had no power to disturb my tranquillity. I however thought it necessary, while I was apparently with∣in the sphere of the enemy, to exert every practi∣cable degree of vigilance. I was careful not to in∣cur the hazards of darkness and solitude. When I left the town, it was with the stage-coach, an obvious source of protection against glaring and enormous violence. Meanwhile I found myself no more exposed to molestation in my progress, than the man in the world who should have had the least reason for apprehensions of this nature. As the distance increased, I relaxed something in my precaution, though still awake to a sense of danger, and constantly pursued with the image of my foe. I fixed upon an obscure market-town in Wales as the chosen seat of my operations. This place re∣commended itself to my observation, as I was wan∣dering in quest of an abode. It was clean, chear∣ful, and of great simplicity of appearance. It was at a distance from any public and frequented road,
<PB N="185" REF="028752_0413_0FDBDB4830C81538"/>
and had nothing which could deserve the name of trade. The face of nature around it was agree∣ably diversified, being partly wild and romantic, and partly rich and abundant in production.</P>
<P>Here I solicited employment in two professions; the first that of a watch-maker, in which though the instructions I had received were but few, they were eked out and assisted by a mind fruitful in mechanical invention; the other that of an in∣structor in mathematics and its practical applica∣tion, geography, astronomy, land-surveying and navigation. Neither of these was a very copious source of emolument in the obscure retreat I had chosen for myself: but, if my receipts were slender, my disbursements were still fewer. In this little town I became acquainted with the vicar, the apo∣thecary, the lawyer, and the rest of the persons who time out of mind had been regarded as the top gentry of the place. Each of these centred in himself a variety of occupations. There was little in the appearance of the vicar that reminded you of his profession except on the recurring Sunday. At other times he condescended with his evange∣lical hand to guide the plough, or to drive the cows from the field to the farm-yard for the milk∣ing. The apothecary occasionally officiated as a barber, and the lawyer was the village school∣master.</P>
<P>By all these persons I was received with kindness and hospitality. Among people thus remote from the bustle of human life there is an open spirit of confidence, by means of which, a stranger easily finds access to their benevolence and good-will. My manners had never been greatly debauched, by the scenes through which I had passed, from the simplicity of rural life; and the hardships I had endured gave additional mildness to my character.
<PB N="186" REF="028752_0414_0FDBDB0268CAC790"/>
In the theatre upon which I was now placed I had no rival. My mechanical occupation had hitherto been a non-resident; and the schoolmaster, who did not aspire to the sublime heights of science I professed to discover, was very willing to admit me as a partner in the task of civilizing the unpolished manners of the inhabitants. For the parson, civi∣lisation was no part of his trade; his business was with the things of a better life, not with the carnal concerns of this material scene; in truth, his thoughts were principally occupied with his oat∣meal and his cows.</P>
<P>This scene had perhaps a more powerful handle upon my affections, than it would have had upon those of almost any other person with my degree of intellectual cultivation. I had had a profound experience, though a short one, of society such as ranks and regulations have constituted it. The simple scene of which I was now an inmate, the abode of gross and unsuspecting ignorance, bore a kind of rude resemblance to that simplicity which seems to be the goal of elevated and comprehensive reason. I bore with its grossness, the narrowness of its prospects and the uniformity of its impres∣sions, in behalf of its freedom from malignity and deceit. How long I should have sat down contented with these defects in consideration of these advantages I am unable to pronounce. For the present, sore with persecution and distress, and bleeding at almost every vein, there was nothing I so much coveted as rest and tranquillity. It seemed as if my faculties were, at least for the time, exhausted by the late preternatural and vice-derived intensity of their ex∣ertions, and that they stood indispensably in need of a period of comparative suspension.</P>
<P>In this state, so grateful to my feelings, week after week glided away without interruption and alarm. Every day contributed to my progress in
<PB N="187" REF="028752_0415_0FDBDB4D86A61E30"/>
the esteem of my guileless neighbours. At first they looked upon me with wonder as a sort of non descript; but they were pleased to find upon farther acquaintance that I fell in for the most part with their habits and manners; and that, though I was able, if solicited, to inform them upon sub∣jects extremely remote from their usual occupa∣tions, yet my superior knowledge gave me no in∣clination to dictate or domineer. The peculiari∣ties in which I differed from them generated no aversion. My habits were more solitary and seden∣tary than those of any of my neighbours: but I state the simple and unornamented fact when I affirm, that my universal character among them was that of a person of great learning and know∣ledge, mild, even-tempered, and that would not hurt so much as a worm.</P>
<P>Thus tranquil, there were moments in which I even forgot there was such a person as Mr. Falk∣land in the world. The situation in which I was now placed was not very different from that in which I had spent my earlier years; and I began to look back upon the intervening period as upon a distempered and tormenting dream; or rather per∣haps my feelings were like those of a man reco∣vered from six months raging delirium, from ideas of horror, confusion, slight, persecution, agony and despair! When I recollected what I had un∣dergone, it was not without some satisfaction as the recollection of a thing that was past; every day augmented my hope that it was never to re∣turn. Surely the dark and terrific menaces of Mr. Falkland were rather the perturbed suggestions of his angry mind, than the final result of a delibe∣rate and digested system! How happy should I feel beyond what ordinarily falls to the lot of man, if, after the terrors and alarms I had undergone, I
<PB N="188" REF="028752_0416_0FDBDB074CFBFD68"/>
found myself thus unexpectedly restored to the im∣munities of a human being!</P>
<P>While I was thus soothing my mind with fond imaginations, it happened that a few bricklayers and their labourers came over from a distance of five or six miles, to work upon some additions to one of the better sort of houses in the town which had changed its tenant. No incident could be more trivial than this, had it not been for a strange coincidence of time between this circumstance and a change which introduced itself into my situation. This first manifested itself in a sort of shyness with which I was treated first by one person and then another of my new-formed acquaintance. They were backward to enter into conversation with me, and answered my enquiries with an aukward and embarrassed air. When they met me in the street or the field, their countenance contracted a cloud, and they endeavoured to shun me. My scholars quitted me one after another, and I had no longer any employment in my mechanical profession. It is impossible to describe the sensations which the gradual, but uninterrupted progress of this revolu∣tion produced in my mind. It seemed as if I had some contagious disease, from which every man shrunk with alarm, and left me to perish unassisted and alone. I asked one man and another to ex∣plain to me the meaning of these appearances; but every one avoided the task, and answered in an evasive and ambiguous manner. I sometimes sup∣posed that it was all a delusion of the imagination; till the repetition of the sensation, and still more the decay of my projected modes of subsistence, brought the reality too painfully home to my ap∣prehension. There are few things that give a greater shock to the mind than a phenomenon in the conduct of our fellow men, of great import∣ance
<PB N="189" REF="028752_0417_0FDBDB4FAB836B68"/>
to our concerns, and for which we are un∣able to assign any plausible reason. I was like a tree struck with some fatal blight, from which one branch falls off after another, and leaves the naked trunk a monument of calamity and scorn. Inca∣pable of assigning the cause of my disgrace, I was at times half inclined to believe that the change was not in other men, but that some alienation of my own understanding generated the horrid vision. I endeavoured to awake from my dream, and re∣turn to my former state of enjoyment and happi∣ness; but in vain. To the same consideration it may be ascribed, that unacquainted with the source of the evil, observing its perpetual increase, and finding it so far as I could perceive entirely arbi∣trary in its nature, I was unable to ascertain its limits, or the degree in which it would finally overwhelm me.</P>
<P>In the midst however of the wonderful and seem∣ingly inexplicable nature of this scene, there was one idea that instantly intruded itself, and that I could never after banish from my mind. It is Falkland! In vain I struggled against the seeming improbability of the supposition. In vain I said, Mr. Falkland, wise as he is and pregnant in re∣sources, acts by human and not by supernatural means. He may overtake me by surprise and in a manner of which I have no previous expectation; but he cannot produce a great and notorious effect without some visible agency, however difficult it may be to trace that agency, to its absolute author. He cannot, like those invisible personages who are supposed from time to time to interfere in human affairs, ride in the whirlwind, shroud himself in clouds and impenetrable darkness, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> de∣struction upon the earth from his secret habitation. Thus it was that I bribed my imagination, and en∣deavoured to persuade myself that my present un∣happiness
<PB N="190" REF="028752_0418_0FDBDB092CB54060"/>
originated in a different source from my former. All evils appeared trivial to me, in com∣parison of the recollection and perpetuation of my parent misfortune. I was little better than distracted between the incoherence of my ideas as to my pre∣sent situation excluding from it the machinations of Mr. Falkland, and the horror I conceived at the bare possibility of again encountering his animosity, after a suspension of many weeks, a suspension as I had hoped for ever. An interval of weeks was an age to a person in the calamitous situation I had so long experienced. But, in spite of all my efforts, I could not banish from my mind the dreadful idea. My original conceptions of the genius and the per∣severance of Mr. Falkland had been such, that I could with difficulty think that any thing was im∣possible to him. I knew not how to set up my own opinions of material causes and the powers of the human mind as the limits of existence. Mr. Falk∣land had always been to my imagination an object of wonder, and that which excites our wonder we scarcely ever suppose ourselves competent to ana∣lyse.</P>
<P>I was in this state of mind, and had already been compelled by the situation of my affairs to meditate the removing myself to a different residence, when a new circumstance occurred, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> tended in part to dissipate the mist which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> over my under∣standing. In reality, nothing at this time appeared more necessary to me than information. Without some conception of the cause of my present mis∣fortune I could not tell whither to remove, nor what precautions my interest obliged me to adopt. I was saved by the incident to which I allude <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the necessity of proceeding entirely at random.</P>
<P>I returned one evening from a pedestrian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> among the mountain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. It is probable that my return was somewhat sooner than was usual with
<PB N="191" REF="028752_0419_0FDBDB535C6B7B70"/>
me upon similar occasions. Be that as it will, I found upon entering the house an apartment of which I occupied, that it was totally deserted of its usual in∣habitants. The woman and her children were gone out to enjoy the freshness of the breeze. The hus∣band was engaged in his usual without-door occu∣pations. I opened for myself, and went into the kitchen of the family. Here, as I looked round, my eyes accidentally glanced upon a paper lying in one corner, which by some association I was unable to explain, roused in me a strong sensation of sus∣picion and curiosity. I eagerly went towards it, caught it up, and found it to be the very paper of the Wonderful and Surprising History of Caleb Williams, the discovery of which towards the close of my residence in London had produced in me such exquisite pain.</P>
<P>This discovery at once cleared up all the mys∣tery that had hung upon my late transactions. Abhorred and intolerable certainty succeeded to the doubts which had haunted my mind. It struck me with the rapidity and irresistible effect of lightning. I was like a man blasted, his head bare and exposed to the fury of the elements.</P>
<P>Was there no hope that remained to me? Was acquittal useless? Was there no period, past or in prospect, that could give relief to my sufferings? Was the odious and atrocious falshood that had been invented against me destined to follow me wherever I went, to strip me of character, to de∣prive me of the sympathy and good will of man∣kind, to wrest from me the very bread by which life must be sustained?</P>
<P>For the space perhaps of half an hour the agony I felt, from this termination to my late tranquillity, and the expectation it excited of that enmity which would follow me through every retreat, was
<PB N="192" REF="028752_0420_0FDBDB0C1B4FCA70"/>
so great as to bereave me of all consistent thinking and of the power of coming to any resolution. As soon as this hurricane of the mind subsided, and the winds that impelled me this way and that were still, one stiff and master gale took its turn of ascendancy, and drove me to an instant desertion of this once-cherished retreat. I had no patience to enter into remonstrance and explanation with the uninstructed inhabitants of my present residence. I had seen too much of the reign of triumphant falshood to have that sanguine confidence in the effects of my innocence, which would have sug∣gested itself to the mind of any other person of my propensities and my age. I could not endure the thought of opposing the venom that was thus scattered against me, in detail and through its mi∣nuter particles. If ever it should be necessary for me to encounter it, if I were pursued like a wild beast till I could no longer avoid turning upon my hunters, I would then turn upon the true author of this unprincipled attack. I would encounter the calumny in its strong hold, I would rouse myself to an exertion hitherto unessayed, and, by the firm∣ness, intrepidity and unalterable constancy I should display, would yet compel mankind to believe that Mr. Falkland was a suborner and a murderer.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>I HASTEN to the conclusion of my melancholy story. I began to write soon after the period to which I have now conducted it. It has served me as a source of avocation for several years. For some time I had a melancholy consolation in writing. I was better pleased to repass in my mind the particulars of calamities that had formerly afflicted me, than to look forward, as at other times I was too apt to do, to those by which I might hereafter be overtaken. I conceived that my story faithfully digested would carry in it an im∣pression of truth that sew men would be able to resist; or at worst that, by leaving it behind me when! should no longer continue to exist, poste∣rity might be induced to do me justice, and, seeing in my example what sort of evils are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon mankind by society as it is at present constituted, might be inclined to turn their atten∣tion upon the fountain from which such bitter waters have been accustomed to flow. But these motives have diminished in their influence. I have contracted something too like a loathing for life and all its appendages. Writing, which was at first a pleasure, is changed into a burthen. I shall compress into a small compass what yet remains to be told.</P>
<P>I found out not long after the period of which I am speaking the precise cause of the mysterious reverse I had experienced in my residence in Wales, and included in that cause what it was I
<PB N="194" REF="028752_0422_0FDBDB0CE7E55930"/>
had to look for in my future adventures. Mr. Falkland had taken the infernal Jones into his pay, a man in three respects most critically qualified for the service in which he was now engaged; by the unfeeling brutality of his temper, by the habits of his mind at once audacious and artful, and by the peculiar animosity and vengeance he had conceived against me. The employment to which this man was hired was that of following me from place to place for the purpose of blasting my reputation, and preventing me from the chance, by continuing long in one residence, of acquiring a character of integrity that might give new weight to any accu∣sation I might at a future time be induced to pre∣fer. He had come to the seat of my residence with the bricklayers and labourers I have men∣tioned; and, while he took care to keep out of sight so far as related to me, was industrious in disseminating that which in the eye of the world seemed to amount to a demonstration of the profli∣gacy and detestableness of my character. It was, no doubt, from him that the detested scroll had been procured, which I had found in my habita∣tion immediately prior to my quitting it. In all this Mr. Falkland, reasoning upon his principles, was only employing a necessary precaution. There was something in the temper of his mind that im∣pressed him with aversion to the idea of violently putting an end to my existence; at the same time that unfortunately he could never deem himself sufficiently secured against my recrimination, so long as I remained alive. As to the fact of Jones being retained by him for this tremendous purpose, he by no means desired that it should become gene∣rally known; but then neither did he look upon the possibility of its being known with terror. It was already too notorious for his wishes, that I had
<PB N="195" REF="028752_0423_0FDBDB58E73EAD38"/>
advanced the most odious charges against him. If he regarded me with abhorrence as the great adver∣sary of his fame, those persons who had had oc∣casion to be at all acquainted with our history, did not entertain less abhorrence against me for my own sake. If they knew all the pains he exerted in causing my evil reputation to follow me, they would consider it as an act of impartial justice, perhaps as a generous anxiety to prevent other men from being imposed upon and injured, as he had been.</P>
<P>What expedient was I to employ for the purpose of counteracting the meditated and barbarous pru∣dence, which was thus destined in all changes of scene to deprive me of the benefits and consolations of human society? There was one expedient against which I was absolutely determined, disguise. I had experienced so many mortifications and such intolerable restraint when I had formerly had re∣course to it, it was associated in my understanding with sensations of such acute anguish, that my mind was thus far entirely convinced: Life was not worth purchasing at so high a price! But, though in this respect I was wholly resolved, there was another point that did not appear to me so material, and in which therefore I was willing to accommodate my∣self to circumstances. I was contented, if that would insure my peace, to submit to the otherwise unmanly expedient of passing by a different name.</P>
<P>But the change of my name, the abruptness with which I removed from place to place, the remote∣ness and the obscurity which I proposed to myself in the choice of my abode, were all insufficient to elude the sagacity of Jones, or the unrelenting con∣stancy with which Mr. Falkland incited my tor∣mentor to pursue me. Whithersoever I removed myself, it was not long before I had occasion to
<PB N="196" REF="028752_0424_0FDBDB0D8F251EF8"/>
perceive this detested adversary in my rear. No words can enable me to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> justice to the sensations which this circumstance produced in me. It was like what has been described of the eye of Omni∣science pursuing the guilty sinner, and darting a ray that awakens him to new sensibility, at every moment when otherwise exhausted nature would lull him into a temporary oblivio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the reproaches of his conscience. Sleep fled from my eyes. No walls could hide me from the discernment of this hated foe. Every where his industry was unwea∣ried to create for me new distress. Rest I had none: relief I had none: never could I count upon an instant's security: never could I wrap myself for a moment in the shroud of oblivion. The mi∣nutes in which I did not actually perceive him, were contaminated and blasted with the certain ex∣pectation of his speedy interference. In my first retreat I had passed some weeks of delusive tran∣quillity, but never after was I happy enough to at∣tain so much as that shadowy gratification. I spent some years in this dreadful vicissitude of pain. My sensations at certain periods partook of insanity.</P>
<P>It has already appeared that I was not of a tem∣per to endure calamity without endeavouring by every means I could devise to delude and disarm it. Recollecting, as I was habituated to do, the various projects by which my situation could be meliorated, the question in one instance occurred to me: Why should I be harassed by the pursuit of this Jones; why, man to man, may I not by the powers of my mind attain the ascendancy over him? at present he appears to be the persecutor and I the persecu∣ted: is not this difference the mere creature of the imagination? May I not employ my ingenuity to vex him with difficulties and laugh at the endless labour to which he will be condemned?</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="028752_0425_0FDBDB5AE962C5B8"/>
Alas, this is a speculation for a mind at ease! It is not the persecution; but the catastrophe which is annexed to it, that makes the difference between the tyrant and the sufferer! In mere corporal ex∣ertion the hunter perhaps is upon a level with the miserable animal he pursues! But could it be for∣gotten by either of us, that at every stage Jones was to gratify his malignant passions by disseminating charges of the most infamous nature and exciting against me the abhorrence of every honest bosom, while I was to sustain the still repeated annihilation of my peace, my character and my bread? Could I by any refinement of my reason convert this dreadful series into sport? I had no philosophy that qualified me for so extraordinary an effort. If under other circumstances I could even have entertained so strange an imagination, I was re∣strained in the present instance by the necessity of providing for myself the means of subsistence, and the fetters which through that necessity the forms of human society imposed upon my exertions.</P>
<P>In one of those changes of residence to which my miserable fate repeatedly compelled me, I met, upon a road which I was obliged to traverse, the friend of my youth, my earliest and best beloved friend, the venerable Collins. It was one of those misfortunes which served to accumulate my distress, that this man had quitted the island of Great Britain only a very few weeks before that fatal reverse of fortune which had ever since pur∣sued me with unrelenting eagerness. Mr. Falk∣land, in addition to the large estate he possessed in England, had a very valuable plantation in the West Indies. This property had been greatly mismanaged by the person who had the direction of it on the spot; and, after various promises and evasions on his part, which, however they might
<PB N="198" REF="028752_0426_0FDBDB12EDD978F8"/>
serve to beguile the patience of Mr. Falkland, had been attended with no salutary fruits, it was resolved that Mr. Collins should go over in person to rectify the abuses which had so long prevailed. There had even been some idea of his residing several years, if not settling finally, upon the plantation. From that hour to the present I had never received the smallest intelligence re∣specting him.</P>
<P>I had always considered the circumstance of his critical absence as one of my severest mis∣fortunes. Mr. Collins had been one of the first persons even in the period of my infancy to con∣ceive hopes of me as of something above the com∣mon standard, and had contributed more than any other to encourage and assist my juvenile stu∣dies. He had been the executor of the little pro∣perty of my father, who had fixed upon him for that purpose in consideration of the mutual affec∣tion that existed between us; and I seemed on every account to have more claim upon his pro∣tection than upon that of any other human being. I had always believed that, had he been present in the crisis of my fortune, he would have felt conviction of my innocence; and, convinced him∣self, would by means of the venerableness and energy of his character have interposed so effectu∣ally, as to have saved me the greater part of my subsequent misfortunes.</P>
<P>No sight therefore could give me a purer de∣light than that which now presented itself to my eyes. It was some time however before either of us recognised the person of the other. Mr. Collins looked at least ten years older than he had none when I last saw him, in addition to which he was in his present appearance pale, sickly and thin. These unfavourable effects had been pro∣duced
<PB N="199" REF="028752_0427_0FDBDB5FCFC4B670"/>
by the change of climate, particularly try∣ing to persons in an advanced period of life. Add to which, I supposed him to be at that moment in the West Indies. I was probably as much al∣tered in the period that had elapsed as he had been. I was the first to recollect him. He was on horseback; I on foot. I had suffered him to pass me. In a moment the full idea of who he was rushed upon my mind: I ran; I called with an impetuous voice; I was unable to restrain the vehemence of my emotions.</P>
<P>The ardour of my feelings disguised my usual tone of speaking, which otherwise Mr. Collins would infallibly have recognised. His sight was already dim; he pulled up his horse till I should overtake him; and then said, Who are you? I do not know you.</P>
<P>My father! exclaimed I, embracing one of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nees with fervour and delight, I am your son! once your little Caleb, whom you a thousand times loaded with your kindness!</P>
<P>The unexpected repetition of my name gave a kind of shuddering emotion to my friend, which was however checked by his age, and the calm and benevolent philosophy that formed one of the most conspicuous of his habits.</P>
<P>I did not expect to see you! replied he.—I did not wish it!</P>
<P>My best, my oldest friend! answered I, respect blending itself with my impatience, Do not say so! I have not a friend any where in the whole world, but you! In you at least let me find sym∣pathy and reciprocal affection! If you knew how anxiously I have thought of you during the whole period of your absence, you would not thus griev∣ously disappoint me in your return.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="028752_0428_0FDBDB8A2AD3B6F0"/>
How is it, said Mr. Collins gravely, that you have been reduced to this forlorn condition? Was it not the inevitable consequence of your own ac∣tions?</P>
<P>The actions of others, not mine! Does not your heart tell you that I am innocent?</P>
<P>No. My observation of your early character taught me that you would be extraordinary. But unhappily all extraordinary men are not good men; that seems to be a lottery, dependent on circum∣stances apparently the most trivial.</P>
<P>Will you hear my justification? I am as sure as I am of my existence that I can convince you of my purity.</P>
<P>Certainly, if you wish it, I will hear you. But that must not be just now. I could have been glad to decline it wholly. At my age I am not fit for the storm, and I am not so sanguine as you in my expectation of the result. Of what would you con∣vince me? That Mr. Falkland is a suborner and a murderer?</P>
<P>I made no answer. My silence was an affirma∣tive to this question.</P>
<P>And what benefit will result from this convic∣tion? I have known you a promising boy, whose character might turn to one side or the other as events should decide. I have known Mr. Falkland in his maturer years, and have always admired him as the living model of liberality and goodness. If you could change all my ideas, and show me that there was no criterion by which vice might be pre∣vented from being mistaken for virtue, what be∣nefit would arise from that? I must part with all my interior consolation, and all my external con∣nections. And for what? What is it you pro∣pose? The death of Mr. Falkland by the hands of the hangman?</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="028752_0429_0FDBD88669F30B50"/>
No. I will not hurt a hair of his head, unless compelled to it by a principle of defence. But surely you owe me justice?</P>
<P>What justice? The justice of proclaiming your innocence? You know what consequences are annexed to that. But I do not believe I shall find you innocent. If you even succeed in perplexing my understanding, you will not succeed in enlight∣ening it. Such is the state of mankind, that in∣nocence when involved in circumstances of sus∣picion can scarcely ever make out a demonstration of its purity, and guilt can often make us feel an insurmountable reluctance to the pronouncing it guilt. Meanwhile for the purchase of this uncer∣tainty I must sacrifice all the remaining comforts of my life. I believe Mr. Falkland to be virtuous, but I know him to be prejudiced. He would never forgive me even this accidental parley, if by any means he should come to be acquainted with it.</P>
<P>Oh, argue not the consequences that are possible to result! answered I impatiently. I have a right to your kindness; I have a right to your assist∣ance!</P>
<P>You have them. You have them to a certain degree; and it is not likely by any process of ex∣amination you can have them entire. You know my habits of thinking. I regard you as vicious; but I do not consider the vicious as proper objects of indignation and scorn. I consider you as a ma∣chine: you are not constituted, I am afraid, to be greatly useful to your fellow men; but you did not make yourself; you are just what circumstances irresistibly compelled you to be. I am sorry for your ill properties; but I entertain no enmity against you, nothing but benevolence. Consider∣ing you in the light in which I at present consider you, I am ready to contribute every thing in my
<PB N="202" REF="028752_0430_0FDBD887EDDADC70"/>
power to your real advantage, and would gladly assist you, if I knew how, in detecting and extir∣pating the errors that have misled you. You have disappointed me, but I have no reproaches to utter: it is more necessary for me to feel compassion for you, than that I should accumulate your misfortune by my censures.</P>
<P>What could I say to such a man as this? Amia∣ble, incomparable man! Never was my mind more painfully divided than at that moment. The more he excited my admiration, the more imperiously did my heart command me, whatever were the price it should cost, to extort his friendship. I was per∣suaded that severe duty required of him, that he should reject all personal considerations, that he should proceed resolutely to the investigation of the truth, and that, if he found the result terminating in my favour, he should resign all his advantages, and, deserted as I was by the world, make a com∣mon cause, and endeavour to compensate the gene∣ral injustice. But was it for me to force this con∣duct upon him, if, now in his declining years, his own fortitude shrunk from it? Alas, neither he nor I foresaw the dreadful catastrophe that was so closely impending! Otherwise I am well assured, that no tenderness for his remaining tranquillity would have withheld him from a compliance with my wishes! On the other hand, could I pretend to know what evils might result to him from his declaring himself my advocate? Might not his integrity be brow-beaten and defeated as mine had been? Did the imbecility of his grey hairs afford no advantage to my terrible adversary in the con∣test? Might not Mr. Falkland reduce him to a condition as wretched and low as mine? After all, was it not vice in me to desire to involve an∣other man as my champion? If he could protect
<PB N="203" REF="028752_0431_0FDBD88FF8D90638"/>
me, had I not yet energy and wisdom and conscious purity enough to protect myself?</P>
<P>Influenced by these considerations, I assented to his views. I assented to be thought hardly of by the man in the world whose esteem I most ardently desired, rather than involve him in possible cala∣mity. I assented to the resigning what appeared to me at that moment as the last practicable com∣fort of my life, a comfort upon the thought of which, while I surrendered it, my mind dwelt with undescribable longings. Mr. Collins was deeply affected with the apparent ingenuousness with which I expressed my feelings. The secret struggle of his mind was, Can this be hypocrisy? The in∣dividual with whom I am conferring, if virtuous, is one of the most disinterestedly virtuous persons in the world. We tore ourselves from each other. Mr. Collins promised, as far as he was able, to have an eye upon my vicissitudes, and to assist me in every respect that was at all consistent with a just recollection of consequences. Thus I parted as it were with my right arm; and voluntarily consented, thus maimed and forlorn, to encounter all the evils that were yet in store for me.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING made an experiment of various situ∣ations, all of them with one uniform result, I at length determined to remove myself, if possible, from the reach of my persecutor, by going into voluntary banishment from my native soil. But it seemed this slender consolation was to be denied to me by the inexorable Falkland. At the time that the project was formed by me I was at no great distance from the east coast of the island, and I determined to take ship at Harwich, and pass im∣mediately into Holland. I accordingly repaired to that place, and went almost as soon as I arrived to the port. But there was no vessel just at that time ready to sail. I left the port, and withdrew to an inn, where after some time I retired to a chamber. I was scarcely there, before the door of the room was opened, and the man, whose countenance was of all others most hateful to my eyes, Jones, entered the apartment. He shut the door again as soon as he entered.</P>
<P>Youngster, said he, I have a little private intel∣ligence to communicate to you. I come as a friend, and that I may save you a labour-in-vain trouble. If you consider what I have to say in that light, it will be the better for you. It is my business now, do you see, for want of a better, to see that you do not break out of bounds. Not that I much matter having one man for my employer, or dancing attendance after another's heels; but I have a
<PB N="205" REF="028752_0433_0FDBDB60E872F330"/>
special kindness for you, for some good turns that you wot of, and therefore I do not stand upon cere∣monies! You have led me a very pretty round already; and, out of the love I bear you, you shall lead me as much farther, if you will. But beware the salt seas! They are out of my orders. You are a prisoner at present, and I believe all your life will remain so. Thanks to the milk-and-water softness of your former master! if I had the order∣ing of these things, it should go with you in an∣other fashion. As long as you think proper, you are a prisoner within the rules; and the rules with which the soft-hearted squire indulges you are all England, Scotland and Wales. But you are not to go out of these climates. The squire is deter∣mined you shall never pass the reach of his dis∣posal. He has therefore given orders that, when∣ever you attempt so to do, you shall be converted from a prisoner at large to a prisoner in the pro∣perer meaning of the word. A friend of mine fol∣lowed you just now to the harbour; I was within call; and, if there had been any appearance of your setting your foot from land, we should have been with you in a trice, and laid you fast by the heels. I would advise you for the future to keep at a proper distance from the sea, for fear of the worst. You see I tell you all this for your good. For my part I should be better satisfied, if you were in limbo, with a rope about your neck, and a comfortable bird's eye prospect to the gallows: but I do as I am directed; and so, good night to you!</P>
<P>The intelligence thus conveyed to me occasioned an instantaneous revolution in both my intellectual and animal system. I disdained to answer or take the smallest notice of the fiend by whom it was de∣livered. It is now three days since I received it,
<PB N="206" REF="028752_0434_0FDBDB62A5F66240"/>
and from that moment to the present my blood has been in a perpetual ferment. My thoughts wan∣der from one idea of horror to another with incre∣dible rapidity. I have had no sleep. I have scarcely remained in one posture for a minute to∣gether. It has been with the utmost difficulty that I have been able to command myself far enough to add a few pages to my story. But, uncertain as I am of the events of each succeeding hour, I thought it right to force myself to the performance of this task. All is not right within me. How it will terminate God knows. I sometimes fear that I shall be wholly deserted of my reason.</P>
<P>What—dark, mysterious, unfeeling, unrelent∣ing tyrant!—is it come to this?—When Nero and Caligula swayed the Roman sceptre, it was a fear∣ful thing to offend these bloody rulers. The em∣pire had already spread itself from climate to cli∣mate, and from sea to sea. If their unhappy vic∣tim fled to the rising of the sun, where the lumi∣nary of day seems to us first to ascend from the waves of the ocean, the power of the tyrant was still behind him. If he withdrew to the west, to Hesperian darkness, and the shores of barbarian Thule, still he was not safe from his gore-drenched foe.—Falkland! art thou the offspring in whom the lineaments of these tyrants are faithfully pre∣served? Was the world with all its climates made in vain for thy helpless, unoffending victim?</P>
<P>Tremble!</P>
<P>Tyrants have trembled surrounded with whole armies of their Janissaries! What should make thee inaccessible to my fury?—No, I will use no dan∣gers! I will unfold a tale—! I will show thee for what thou art to the world, and all the men that live shall confess my truth!—Didst thou imagine that I was altogether passive, a mere worm, or∣ganized to feel sensations of pain, but no emo∣tion of resentment? Didst thou imagine that
<PB N="207" REF="028752_0435_0FDBDB6420FAC3A8"/>
there was no danger in inflicting on me pains how∣ever great, miseries however dreadful? Didst thou believe me impotent, imbecil and idiot-like, with no understanding to contrive thy ruin, and no energy to perpetrate it?</P>
<P>I will tell a tale—! The justice of the country shall hear me! The elements of nature in universal uproar shall not interrupt me! I will speak with a voice more fearful than thunder!—Why should I be supposed to speak from any dishonourable motive? I am un∣der no prosecution now! I shall not now appear to be endeavouring to remove a criminal indictment from myself, by throwing it back on its author!—Shall I regret the ruin that will overwhelm thee! Too long have I been tender-hearted and forbearing! What benefit has ever resulted from my mistaken clemency? There is no evil thou hast scrupled to accumulate upon me! Neither will I be more scru∣pulous! Thou hast shown no mercy; and thou shalt receive none!—I must be calm! Bold as a lion, yet collected!</P>
<P>This is a moment pregnant with fate. I know—I think I know—that I will be triumphant, and crush my seemingly omnipotent foe. But should it be otherwise, at least he shall not be every way suc∣cessful. His fame shall not be immortal as he thinks. These papers shall preserve the truth: they shall one day be published, and then the world shall do justice on us both. Recollecting that, I shall not die wholly without consolation. It is not to be endured that falshood and tyranny should reign for ever.</P>
<P>How impotent are the precautions of man against the eternally-existing laws of the intellectual world? This Falkland has invented against me every species of foul accusation? He has hunted me from city to city. He has drawn his lines of circumvallation round me that I may not escape. He has kept his
<PB N="208" REF="028752_0436_0FDBDB67DDAA48B8"/>
s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enters of human prey for ever at my heels. He may hunt me out of the world.—In vain! With this engine, this little pen I defeat all his machina∣tions; I stab him in the very point he was most solicitous to defend!</P>
<P>Collins! I now address myself to you. I have consented that you should yield me no assistance in my present terrible situation. I am content to die rather than do any thing injurious to your felicity.—But, remember,—you are my father still!—I conjure you, by all the love you ever bore me, by the benefits you have conferred on me, by the forbearance and kindness towards you that now penetrates my soul, by my innocence—for, if these be the last words I shall ever write, I die protesting my innocence!—by all these or whatever tie more sacred has influence on your soul, I conjure you, listen to my last request! Preserve these papers from destruction, and preserve them from Falkland? It is all I ask! I have taken care to provide a safe mode of conveying them into your possession; and I have a firm confidence which I will not suffer to depart from me, that by some means or other they will one day find their way to the public!</P>
<P>The pen lingers in my trembling fingers!—Is there any thing I have left unsaid?—The contents of the fatal chest from which originated all my misfortunes I have never been able to ascertain. I once thought it contained some murderous instru∣ment or relique connected with the fate of the un∣happy Tyrrel. I am now persuaded that the secret it inclosed was a faithful narrative of that and its concomitant transactions to be reserved in case of the worst, that, if by any unforeseen event the guilt of Falkland should ever come to be fully dis∣closed, it might contribute to redeem the wreck of his reputation. But it is no matter. If Falkland shall never be detected to the satisfaction of the
<PB N="209" REF="028752_0437_0FDBDB693044EF00"/>
world, such a narrative will probably never see the light. In that case this story of mine may amply, severely perhaps supply its place.</P>
<P>I know not what it is that renders me thus so∣lemn. I have a secret foreboding as if I should never again be master of myself. If I succeed in what I now meditate respecting Falkland, my precaution in removing these papers will have been unnecessary; I shall no longer be reduced to arti∣fice and evasion. If I fail, the precaution will ap∣pear to be wisely chosen.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>ALL is over. I have carried into execution my meditated attempt. My situation is totally chang∣ed; I now sit down to give an account of it. For several weeks after the completion of this dreadful business, my mind was in too tumultuous a state to permit me to write. I think I shall now be able to arrange my thoughts sufficiently for that purpose. Great God! how wondrous, how terrible are the events that have intervened since I was last employ∣ed in a similar manner! It is no wonder that my thoughts were solemn, and my mind filled with horrible forebodings!</P>
<P>Having formed my resolution, I set out from Harwich for the metropolitan town of the county in which Mr. Falkland resided. Jones I well knew was in my rear. That was of no consequence to me. He might wonder at the direction I pursued, but he could not tell with what purpose I pursued it. My design was a secret carefully locked up in my own breast. It was not without a sentiment of terror that I entered a town which had been the scene of my long imprisonment. I proceeded to the house of the chief magistrate the instant I ar∣rived, that I might give no time to my adversary to counterwork my proceeding.</P>
<P>I told him who I was, and that I was come from a distant part of the kingdom for the purpose of rendering him the medium of a charge of murder
<PB N="211" REF="028752_0439_0FDBDB70A8EDFF30"/>
against my former master. My name was already familiar to him. He answered that he could not take cognizance of my deposition, that I was an object of universal execration in that part of the world, and he was determined upon no account to be the vehicle of my depravity.</P>
<P>I warned him to consider well what he was about. I called upon him for no favour; I only applied to him in the regular exercise of his func∣tion. Would he take upon him to say that he had a right at his pleasure to suppress a charge of this complicated nature? I had to accuse Mr. Falkland of repeated murders. The perpetrator knew that I was in possession of the truth upon the sub∣ject; and, knowing that, I went perpetually in danger of my life from his malice and revenge. I was determined to go through with the business, if justice were to be obtained from any court in England. Upon what pretence did he refuse my deposition? I was in every respect a competent witness. I was of age to understand the nature of an oath; I was in my perfect senses; I was un∣tarnished by the verdict of any jury, or the sentence of any judge. His private opinion of my charac∣ter could not alter the law of the land. I demand∣ed to be confronted with Mr. Falkland, and I was well assured I should substantiate the charge to the satisfaction of the whole world. If he did not think proper to apprehend him upon my single tes∣timony, I should be satisfied if he only sent him notice of the charge and summoned him to appear.</P>
<P>The magistrate finding me thus resolute, thought proper a little to lower his tone. He no longer absolutely refused to comply with my requisition, but condescended to expostulate with me. He re∣presented to me Mr. Falkland's health which had for some years been exceedingly indifferent, his
<PB N="212" REF="028752_0440_0FDBDB746760F690"/>
having been already once brought to trial, upon the same accusation, the diabolical malice in which alone my proceeding must have originated, and the tenfold ruin it would bring down upon my own head. I should be pilloried for perjury, if not hanged for the robbery, in relation to which Mr. Falkland had so generously spared me upon a for∣mer occasion. To all these representations my an∣swer was short. I was determined to go on, and would abide the consequences. A summons was at length granted, and notice sent to Mr. Falkland of the charge preferred against him.</P>
<P>Three days elapsed before any farther step could be taken in this business. This interval in no de∣gree contributed to tranquillise my mind. The thought of preferring a capital accusation against, and hastening the death of such a man as Mr. Falkland, was by no means an opiate to reflexion. At one time I commended the action, either as just revenge (for the benevolence of my nature was in a great degree turned to sour), or as neces∣sary self-defence, or as that which in an impartial and philanthropical estimate included the smallest evil. At another time I was haunted with doubts. But, spite of these variations of sentiment, I uni∣formly determined to persist; I felt as if impelled by an unconquerable necessity. The consequences were such as might well appal the stoutest heart. Either the ignominious execution of a man whom I had once so deeply venerated, and whom now I sometimes suspected not to be without his claims to veneration; or a confirmation, perhaps an increase, of the calamities I had so endured. Yet these I pre∣ferred to a state of uncertainty. I desired to know the worst; to put an end to the hope, however faint, which had been so long my torment; and above all to exhaust and finish the catalogue of ex∣pedients

that were within my disposition. My mind was worked up to a state little short of frenzy. My body was in a burning fever with the agita∣tion of my thoughts. When I laid my hand upon my bosom or my head, it seemed to scorch them with the fervency of its heat. I could not sit still for a moment. I panted with incessant desire that the dreadful crisis I had so eagerly invoked were come, and were over.</P>
<P>After an interval of three days I met Mr. Falk∣land in the presence of the magistrate to whom I had applied upon the subject. I had only two hours notice to prepare myself, Mr. Falkland seem∣ing as eager as I to have the question brought to a crisis, and laid at rest for ever. I had an opportu∣nity before the examination to learn that Mr. Fo∣rester was gone upon some business on an excursion to the continent, and that Collins, whose health when I saw him was in a very precarious state, was at this time confined with alarming illness. His constitution had been wholly broken with his West Indian voyage. The audience I met at the house of the magistrate consisted of several gentlemen and others selected for the purpose, the plan being to find a medium between the suspicious air of a private examination, and the indelicacy as it was styled of an examination exposed to the remark of every accidental spectator.</P>
<P>I can conceive of no shock greater than that I received from the sight of Mr. Falkland. His ap∣pearance on the last occasion on which we met had been haggard, ghost-like and wild, energy in his gestures and frenzy in his aspect. It was now the appearance of a corpse. He was brought in in a chair unable to stand, fatigued and almost destroyed by the journey he had just taken. His visage was colourless; his limbs destitute of motion, almost
<PB N="214" REF="028752_0442_0FDBDB7AA8029590"/>
of life. His head reclined upon his bosom, except that now and then he listed it up and opened his eyes with a languid glance, immediately after which he sunk back into his former apparent in∣sensibility. He seemed not to have three hours to live. He had kept his chamber for several weeks; but the summons of the magistrate had been de∣livered to him at his bed-side; his orders respecting letters and written papers being so peremptory that no one dared to disobey them. Upon reading the paper he was seized with a very dangerous fit; but, as soon as he recovered, he insisted upon being conveyed with all practicable expedition to the place of appointment. Falkland in the most helpless state was still Falkland, firm in command, and capable to extort obedience from every one that approached him.</P>
<P>What a sight was this to me! Till the moment that Falkland was presented to my view, my breast was steeled to pity. I thought that I had coolly en∣tered into the reason of the case (passion in a state of solemn and omnipotent vehemence always ap∣pears to be coolness to him in whom it domineers); and that I had determined impartially and justly. I believed that, if Mr. Falkland were permitted to persist in his schemes, we must both of us be completely wretched. I believed that it was in my power by the resolution I had formed to throw my share of this wretchedness from me and that his could scarcely be increased. It appeared therefore to my mind to be a mere piece of equity and justice, such as an impartial spectator would desire, that one person should be miserable in preference to two, that one person rather than two should be in∣capacitated from acting his part, and contributing his share to the general good. I thought that in this business I had risen superior to personal consi∣derations,
<PB N="215" REF="028752_0443_0FDBDB7BE8F5E6A0"/>
and judged with a total neglect of the miserable suggestions of self-regard. It is true Mr. Falkland was mortal: but, notwithstanding his apparent decay, he might live long. Ought I to submit to waste the best years of my life in my present wretched situation? He had declared that his reputation should be for ever inviolate; this was his ruling passion, the thought that worked his soul to madness. He would probably therefore leave a legacy of persecution to be received by me from the hands of Jones or some other villain equally atrocious, when he should himself be no more. Now or never was the time for me to re∣deem my future life from endless woe.</P>
<P>But all these fine-spun reasonings vanished be∣fore the object that was now exhibited to me. Shall I trample upon a man thus dreadfully re∣duced? Shall I point my animosity against one whom the system of nature has brought down to the grave? Shall I poison with sounds the most in∣tolerable to his ears the last moments of a man like Falkland? It is impossible. There must have been some dreadful mistake in the train of argument that persuaded me to be the author of this hateful scene. There must have been a better and more magnanimous remedy to the evils under which I groaned.</P>
<P>It was too late. The mistake I had committed was now gone past all power of recal. Here was Falkland solemnly brought before a magistrate to answer a charge of murder. Here I stood, having already declared myself the author of the charge, gravely and sacredly pledged to support it. This was my situation; and, thus situated, I was called upon immediately to act. My whole frame shook. I would eagerly have consented that that moment should have been the last of my existence. I how∣ever
<PB N="216" REF="028752_0444_0FDBDB80C4C396D8"/>
believed that the conduct now most indispen∣sably incumbent on me, was to lay the emotions of my soul naked before my hearers. I looked first at Mr. Falkland, and then at the magistrate and at∣tendants, and then at Mr. Falkland again. My voice was suffocated with agony. I began:</P>
<P>Why cannot I recal the four last days of my life? How was it possible for me to be so eager, so obstinate in a purpose so diabolical? Oh, that I had listened to the expostulations of the magistrate that hears me, or submitted to the well-meant des∣potism of his authority! Hitherto I have only been miserable; henceforth I shall account myself base! Hitherto, though hardly treated by mankind, I stood acquitted at the bar of my own conscience. I had not filled up the measure of my wretched∣ness!</P>
<P>Would to God it were possible for me to retire from this scene without uttering another word! I would brave the consequences—I would sub∣mit to any imputation of cowardice, falshood and profligacy, rather than add to the weight of misfortune with which Mr. Falkland is over∣whelmed. But the situation and the demands of Mr. Falkland himself forbid me. He, in compas∣sion for whose fallen state I would willingly forget every interest of my own, would compel me to ac∣cuse, that he might enter upon his justification.—I will confess every sentiment of my heart.</P>
<P>No penitence, no anguish can expiate the folly and the cruelty of this last act I have perpetrated. But Mr. Falkland well knows—I affirm it in his presence—how unwillingly I have proceeded to this extremity. I have reverenced him; he was wor∣thy of reverence: I have loved him; he was en∣dowed with qualities that partook of divine.</P>
<P>From the first moment I saw him, I conceived for him the most ardent admiration. He conde∣scended
<PB N="217" REF="028752_0445_0FDBDB81EB6E7C08"/>
to encourage me; I attached myself to him with all the fulness of affection. He was un∣happy; I exerted myself with youthful curiosity to discover the secret of his woe. This was the beginning of misfortune.</P>
<P>What shall I say?—He was indeed the murderer of Tyrrel; he suffered the Hawkinses to be ex∣ecuted, knowing that they were innocent, and that he alone was guilty. After successive surmises, after various indiscretions on my part and indica∣tions on his, he at length confided to me at full the fatal tale!</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland! I most solemnly conjure you to recollect yourself! Did I ever prove myself un∣worthy of your confidence? The secret was a most painful burthen to me; it was the extremest folly that led me unthinkingly to gain possession of it; but I would have died a thousand deaths rather than betray it. It was the jealousy of your own thoughts, and the weight that hung upon your mind, that led you to watch my motions, and con∣ceive alarm from every particle of my conduct.</P>
<P>You began in confidence; why did you not con∣tinue in confidence? The evil that resulted from my original imprudence, would then have been comparatively little. You threatened me: did I then betray you? A word from my lips at that time would have freed me from your threats for ever. I bore them for a considerable period, and at last quitted your service, and threw myself a fugitive upon the world in silence. Why did you not suffer me to depart? You brought me back by stratagem and violence, and wantonly accused me of an enormous felony; did I then mention a syllable of the murder, the secret of which was in my possession?</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="028752_0446_0FDBDB836A6CCF30"/>
Where is the man that has suffered more from the injustice of society than I have done? I was accused of a villainy that my heart abhorred. I was sent to jail. I will not enumerate the horrors of my prison, the lightest of which would make the heart of humanity shudder. I looked forward to the gallows! Young, ambitious, fond of life, innocent as the child unborn, I looked forward to the gallows! I believed that one word of resolute accusation against my master would deliver me, yet I was silent, I armed myself with patience, uncertain whether it were better to accuse or to die. Did this shew me a man unworthy to be trusted?</P>
<P>I determined to break out of prison. With in∣finite difficulty and repeated miscarriages I at length effected my purpose. Instantly a proclamation with a hundred guineas reward was issued for ap∣prehending me. I was obliged to take refuge among the scum of mankind, in the midst of a gang of thieves. I encountered the most imminent peril of my life when I entered into this retreat, and when I quitted it. Immediately after I tra∣velled almost the whole length of the kingdom in poverty and distress, in hourly danger of being re∣taken and manacled like a felon. I would have fled my country; I was prevented. I had recourse to various disguises; I was innocent, and yet was compelled to as many arts and subterfuges as could have been entailed on the worst of villains. In London I was as much harassed and as repeatedly alarmed, as I had been in my flight through the country. Did all these persecutions persuade me to put an end to my silence? No: I suffered them with patience and submission; I did not make one attempt to re∣tort them upon their author.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="028752_0447_0FDBDB892E76E5C0"/>
I fell at last into the hands of the miscreants that are nourished with human blood. In this terrible situation I for the first time attempted by turning informer to throw the weight from myself. Happily for me the London magistrate listened to my tale with insolent contempt.</P>
<P>I soon and long repented of my rashness and re∣joiced in my miscarriage. I acknowledge that in various ways Mr. Falkland shewed humanity to∣wards me during this period. He would have pre∣vented my going to prison at first; he contributed to my subsistence during my detention; he had no share in the pursuit that had been set on foot against me; he at length procured my discharge when brought forward for trial. But a great part of his forbearance was unknown to me; I supposed him to be my unrelenting pursuer. I could not forget that, whoever heaped calamities on me in the sequel, they all originated in his forged accu∣sation.</P>
<P>The prosecution against me for felony was now at an end. Why were not my sufferings permitted to terminate then, and I allowed to hide my weary head in some obscure yet tranquil retreat? Had I not sufficiently proved my constancy and fidelity? Would not a compromise in this situation have been most wife and most secure? But the restless and jealous anxiety of Mr. Falkland would not per∣mit him to repose the least atom of confidence. The only compromise that he proposed was, that with my own hand I should sign myself a villain. I refused this proposal, and have ever since been driven from place to place, deprived of peace, of honest same, even of bread. For a long time I persisted in the resolution that no emergency should convert me into the assailant. In evil hour I at last listened to my resentment and impatience, and
<PB N="220" REF="028752_0448_0FDBD884A8DF39F0"/>
the hateful mistake into which I fell has produced the present scene.</P>
<P>I now see that mistake in all its enormity. I am sure that, if I had opened my heart to Mr. Falkland, if I had told to him privately the tale that I have now been telling, he could not have re∣sisted my reasonable demand. After all his pre∣cautions, he must ultimately have depended upon my forbearance. Could he be sure that, if I were at last worked up to disclose every thing I knew, and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it with all the energy I could exert, I should obtain no credit? If he must in every case be at my mercy, in which mode ought he to have sought his safety, in conciliation or in inexorable cruelty?</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland is of a noble nature. Yes; in spite of the catastrophe of Tyrrel, of the misera∣ble end of the Hawkinses, and of all that I have myself suffered, I affirm that he has qualities of the most admirable kind. It is therefore impossible that he could have resisted a frank and fervent ex∣postulation, the frankness and the fervour in which the whole soul was poured out. I despaired, while it was yet time to have made the just experiment; but my despair was criminal, was treason against the sovereignty of truth.</P>
<P>I have told a plain and unadulterated tale. I came hither to curse, but I remain to bless. I came to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, but am compelled to applaud. I pro∣claim to all the world that Mr. Falkland is a man worthy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> affection and kindness, and that I am myself the worst of villains! Never will I forgive myself the iniquity of this day. The memory will always haunt me, and embitter every hour of my existence. In thus acting I have been a murderer, a cool, deliberate, unfeeling murderer.—I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> what my accursed precipitation has obliged me
<PB N="221" REF="028752_0449_0FDBDB8F024183C0"/>
to say. Do with me as you please! I ask no favour. Death would be a kindness, compared to what I feel!</P>
<P>Such were the accents dictated by my remorse. I poured them out with uncontroulable impetuosity, for my heart was pierced, and I was compelled to give vent to its anguish. Every one that heard me was petrified with astonishment. Every one that heard me was melted into tears. They could not resist the ardour with which I praised the great qualities of Falkland; they manifested their sym∣pathy in the tokens of my penitence.</P>
<P>How shall I describe the feelings of this unfor∣tunate man? Before I began, he seemed sunk and debilitated, incapable of any strenuous impression. When I mentioned the murder, I could perceive in him an involuntary shuddering, though it was counteracted partly by the feebleness of his frame, and partly by the energy of his mind. This was an allegation he expected, and he had endeavoured to prepare himself for it. But there was much of what I said, of which he had had no previous con∣ception. When I expressed the anguish of my mind, he seemed at first startled and alarmed lest this should be a new expedient to gain credit to my tale. His indignation against me was great for having retained all my resentment towards him thus, as it might be, in the last hour of his ex∣istence. It was increased, when he discovered me, as he supposed, using a pretence of liberality and sentiment, to give new edge to my hostility. But, as I went on, he could no longer resist. He saw my sincerity; he was penetrated with my grief and compunction. He rose from his seat supported by the attendants, and—to my infinite astonishment—threw himself into my arms!</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="028752_0450_0FDBDB90ECD6E990"/>
Williams, said he, you have conquered! I see too late the greatness and elevation of your mind. I adore the qualities that you now display, though to those qualities I owe my ruin. I could have re∣sisted any plan of malicious accusation you might have brought against me. But I see that the artless and manly story you have told, has carried con∣viction to every hearer. All my prospects are concluded. All that I most ardently desired is for ever frustrated. I have spent a life of the basest cruelty to cover one act of momentary vice and to protect myself against the prejudices of my species. I stand now completely detected. My name will be consecrated to infamy, while your heroism, your patience and your virtues will be for ever ad∣mired. You have inflicted on me the most fatal of all mischiefs, but I bless the hand that wounds me. And now,—turning to the magistrate—and now, do with me as you please. I am prepared to suffer all the vengeance of the law. You cannot inflict on me more than I deserve. You cannot hate me more than I hate myself. I am the most execrable of all villains. I have for years (I know not how long) dragged on a miserable existence in insup∣portable pain. I am at last, in recompense for all my labours and my crimes, dismissed from it, with the disappointment of my only remaining hope, the destruction of that for the sake of which alone I consented to exist. It was worthy of such a life, that it should continue just long enough to witness this final overthrow. If however you wish to punish me, you must be speedy in your justice; for, as reputation was the blood that warmed my heart, so I feel that death and infamy must seize me together.</P>
<P>I record the praises bestowed on me by Falk∣land, not because I deserve them, but because they
<PB N="223" REF="028752_0451_0FDBDB926869A848"/>
serve to aggravate the baseness of my cruelty. He survived but three days this dreadful scene. I have been his murderer. It was fit that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> praise my patience, who has fallen a victim <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and fame, to my precipitation! It would have been merciful in comparison, if I had planted a dagger in his heart! He would have thanked me for my kindness. But, atrocious, execrable wretch that I have been! I wantonly inflicted on him an anguish a thousand times worse than death. Mean∣while I endure the penalty of my crime. His figure is ever in imagination before me. Waking or sleeping I still behold him. He seems mildly to expostu∣late with me for my unfeeling behaviour. I live the devoted victim of conscious reproach. Alas! I am the same Caleb Williams that but ten days before boasted, that, however great were the cala∣mities I endured, I was still innocent.</P>
<P>Such has been the result of a project I formed for delivering myself from the evils that had so long attended me. I thought that, if Falkland were dead, I should return once again to all that makes life worth possessing. I thought that, if the guilt of Falkland were established, fortune and the world would smile upon my efforts. Both these events are accomplished; and it is only now that I am truly miserable.</P>
<P>Why should my reflections perpetually centre upon myself? self, an overweening regard to which has been the source of my errors! Falkland, I will think only of thee, and from that thought will draw ever-fresh nourishment for my sorrows! One generous, one disinterested tear I will consecrate to thy ashes! A nobler spirit lived not among the sons of men. Thy intellectual powers were truly sublime, and thy bosom burned with a godlike am∣bition. But of what use are talents and sentiments
<PB N="224" REF="028752_0452_0FDBDB96718DBAE0"/>
in the corrupt wilderness of human society? It is a rank and rotten soil from which every finer shrub draws poison as it grows. All that in a happier field and a purer air would expand into virtue and germinate into general usefulness, is thus converted into henbane and deadly nightshade.</P>
<P>Falkland! thou settedst out in thy career with the purest and most laudable intentions. But thou imbibedst the poison of chivalry with thy earliest youth▪ and the base and low-minded envy that met thee on thy return to thy native seats, operated with this poison to hurry thee into madness. Soon, too soon, by this fatal coincidence were the bloom∣ing hopes of thy youth blasted for ever! From that moment thou only continuedst to live to the phan∣tom of departed honour. From that moment thy benevolence was in a great part turned into rank∣ling jealousy and inexorable precaution. Year after year didst thou spend in this miserable project of imposture; and only at last continuedst to live long enough to see, by my misjudging and abhor∣red intervention, thy closing hope disappointed, and thy death accompanied with the foulest dis∣grace!</P>
<P>I began these memoirs with the idea of vindi∣cating my own character. I have now no charac∣ter that I wish to vindicate: but I will finish them that thy story may be fully understood; and that, if those errors of thy life be known which thou so ardently desiredst to conceal, the world may at least not hear and repeat a half-told and mangled tale.</P>
