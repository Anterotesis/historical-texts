</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE design of the Deity in send∣ing a Saviour into the world, who should adorn our nature by his example, reform us by his laws, and expiate for our crimes by his death, was so vast in its nature and important in its con∣sequences, that none of the component parts of it, which are discoverable by reason, are unworthy our notice. The curiosity of a speculative mind would of itself naturally excite an enquiry into every part of the Divine conduct unfolded by the works of creation, or the facred scriptures. But here the strong and powerful motive of in∣terest would be superadded, to awaken our con∣templation on the most wonderful event in the history of the intelligent world.</P>
<P>According to our ideas of power, wisdom and greatness, we should naturally suppose that the first scene, which introduced so illustrious a cha∣racter
<PB N="6" REF="034645_0004_0FFF4507AAC28880"/>
as the Lord Jesus Christ unto the human drama, must be grand and awful, and attended with every circumstance of pomp and magnifi∣cence, which could strike the eyes and the senses, of men. This opinion would be warranted by a sacred precedent, the promulgation of the law from Mount Sinai. If on that occasion the mountain was covered with smoke, the thunders, the lightnings and the found of the trumpet oc∣casioned terror and dismay in the minds of those people, on whose account these divine energies were displayed, might we not infer that the effects of it in the natural world, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> would be proportionally more great and astonishing, when ushering in a still more glorious demonstration of the Eternal to his crea∣tures? In a word, that when the <HI> Desire of all Nations</HI> made his appearance not figuratively, but literally, God would shake the heavens and the earth, and fill, not only his temple at Jeru∣salem, but the whole earth with his visible glory?</P>
<P>In these, however, as well as in our other rea∣sonings on the government of God, we find that our most plausible opinions are not always the best founded. Greatness and simplicity are near∣ly allied. Objects, which dazzle at the first, soon become familiar to the eye. Like the sensible ho∣rizon, they diminish in estimation, on experiment and knowledge. Others, which appear minute and inconsiderable, upon a closer inspection dis∣cover marks of the deepest contrivance and pro∣foundest design. The most beautiful and magni∣ficent fabric, that was ever reared by human hand, can by the eye of the ingenious artist be easily traced from the basis to the superstructure; while the origin of the smallest insect in the ani∣mal
<PB N="7" REF="034645_0005_0FFF45092F121838"/>
or the arcana of the least plant in the vege∣table world, cannot be explained by the most learned philosopher. The reason is obvious.—The first is a human, the second a divine pro∣duction.</P>
<P>Corresponding with our last remarks, the birth of Jesus Christ was not attended with the false glare of worldly glory and grandeur, nor with that pomp and ostentation, which affect the ima∣gination and senses of the weak and unthinking of mankind. On a review, however, of all the circumstances which attended that event, it would not be difficult to demonstrate that the wisdom of God in the moral and intelligent, is as much su∣perior to human calculations, as his sublime and beautiful productions in the material creation are preferable to the monuments and beauties of art. For this cause the humble and retired village of Bethlehem was preferred to the populous and su∣perb city of Rome for the first appearance of the Messiah. A manger, not a palace, was the first seene to which the first and best of God's intel∣ligent creatures was introduced. The unkind and inhospitable temper of those who were present as spectators, was a presage of the ingratitude of that world which he came to redeem; while at his birth, the contrast between heavenly honours and earthly debasement was an emblem of his future condition in the world—a striking picture of a life made up of indigence, misery and won∣ders.</P>
<P>The Almighty, however, gave to mankind sufficient indications of his divine agency in so important an event as the nativity of the Redeem∣er. The celestial messengers were directed to an∣nounce those joyful tidings to the shepherds in the
<PB N="8" REF="034645_0006_0FFF450BBB0F3F58"/>
vicinity. Other occurrences equally remarkable engaged the attention of those who, from the language of their ancient prophets, were waiting with anxiety for their patron and saviour, and fully persuaded that the auspicious aera was at hand.</P>
<P>The words of the text are a part of the mes∣sage announced by the angel. They point out his birth, and describe its effects. As my main design is to speak this day on the important ad∣vantages that mankind have derived from the advent and mission of Christ, I shall take the li∣berty to invert the order of the verses in further prosecuting the subject.</P>
<P N="1">I. I shall make some remarks on the wisdom of Providence, that the birth of Christ should be circumstanced in the manner related by St. Luke and another evangelist. <HI>For unto you is born this day a Saviour which is Christ the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. Take a summary view of the extensive ad∣vantages which mankind have derived from the example of Jesus Christ, and the princi∣ples of his religion. <HI>Behold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be unto all people.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. Offer a few reflections.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> I shall make some remarks on the wis∣dom of Providence, that the birth of Christ should be circumstanced in the manner related by St. Luke and another evangelist. <HI>For unto you is born, &amp;c;.</HI></P>
<P>First of all, the nation among whom he was born had been from remote antiquity favoured with a divine revelation; in which clear and strong indications were given of the designs of
<PB N="9" REF="034645_0007_0FFF450D437B6738"/>
Providence respecting the redemption of mankind by Christ. To Abraham, the first of the Patri∣archs, it was declared, <HI>that in his feed all nations of the earth should be blessed.</HI> To his two imme∣diate descendants a promise of like import was uttered. To Moses, the great and inspired law∣giver of the Jews, it was foretold, that a prophet like unto himself should arise armed with plena∣ry powers, for the propagation of true religion and moral virtue in the world. By the succeed∣ing prophets, particularly Isaiah, not only the great and marvellous, but many of the most mi∣nute events of his life, as well as of the circum∣stances of his sufferings and death, were predicted with historical exactness. A people, who had such credentials of the divine promises, were not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the most likely to receive the Messiah, but were the fairest and fittest judges of his preten∣sions. For they had little else to do, but to in∣spect the inspired language of their laws and pro∣phets, and compare it with the accomplishment in his life and actions. This cause may be ra∣tionally assigned why, in the counsels of Hea∣ven, an obscure part of an obscure country was preferred, for the dawnings of the light of the world, to Greece, with her literary same, or Rome, with the splendour and majesty of her conquests.</P>
<P>In the <HI>second place,</HI> the <HI>family,</HI> from which he descended afford us a remark similar to the last. Humble and depressed in their fortunes, so far as to be obliged at his birth to take advantage of the sacrifice customary for the poor; at the same time venerable for a long line of ancestors, em∣bracing both the sanctity of Patriarchs and the majesty of Kings. From these facts it is clear∣ly
<PB N="10" REF="034645_0008_0FFF450ECC0ABF98"/>
evident, that wealth is of no consequence in the sight of God, and that he meant, to intro∣duce. Christ and his gospel independent of any human influence; at the same time it was order∣ed by Providence, that nothing mean or degrading might take place in the nativity of so illustrious a personage.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The omens and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> attending his birth were just indications of his character and errand to the world. The Star in the east was a harbinger of the Sun of Righteousness. The anx∣ious enquiry of the wise men implied, that a sys∣tem of truth and righteousness was wanted to in∣struct mankind, notwithstanding <HI>the wisdom of the world.</HI> The pacific manner in which he was in∣troduced to the world; quadrated with the hum∣ble temper and benevolent; conduct displayed in every part of his private life or public ministry. The cruel jealousy of Herod was the first accom∣plishment of those inspired predictions, which an∣nounced him to be <HI>a man of sorrows,</HI> from the cradle to the cross, while his divine preservation from the designs, of that tyrant was a presage of the success of his gospel against the clashing in∣terests and corrupt morals of the world.</P>
<P>A <HI>fourth</HI> observation which occurs, is, the fit∣ness and prosperity of that precise period of time assigned for his birth. The Assyrian, the Per∣sian, and the Grecian monarchies had been swal∣lowed up by the Roman power. Profound peace was established in all parts of the civilized world. From the causes last mentioned, it was a task nei∣ther difficult nor dangerous to travel from one country to another. It was an age which has been renowned for the progress of urbanity, and of the arts and sciences. The inestimable re∣mains
<PB N="11" REF="034645_0009_0FFF451473493A08"/>
of ancient literature, the sublime efforts of genius which have scarce ever been equalled, and we are sure have never been exceeded by any na∣tion or individual from that aera to the present, amply qualified that generation to detect false∣hood and imposture. For had the prejudices of the Jews been such as to admit a deceiver from the hopes of national grandeur; still they were but an inferior, weak province of a foreign go∣vernment. Had Christ appeared at an earlier date, the division of mankind into small govern∣ments, independent of each other, and mutually hostile, would have required as constant prodi∣gies in the whole process, as were wrought at the first promulgation of the gospel. The general expectation of both Jews and Gentiles that a prince and lawgiver was soon to arise, who should govern the earth, prepared their minds for the reception of the Christian system, and its Author. Had God longer delayed his gracious designs, their expectations would have languished for want of their completion. It was therefore in the ful∣ness of time that God sent forth his Son. By the convulsions and revolutions which preceded that event, the words of his holy prophet were fulfilled. <HI>Every valley shall be exalted, every mountain and hill shall be made low, the crooked shall be made strait, and the rough places plain. The glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.</HI></P>
<P>The incidents already enumerated, justify the observations of a learned and ingenious author on the resurrection, which we think will equally ap∣ply to the nativity of Christ, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that <Q>God, in unfolding his purpose to the world, differed widely in his operations, from what would
<PB N="12" REF="034645_0010_0FFF4515F83678F0"/>
have been expected or calculated by human sagacity.</Q> That by a sovereign act of power he could have subdued the whole human race to his law and will, there is no manner of question. But, by adopting a different method, he has shown that his dispensations in the order of grace shall co-operate with his natural providence, and the settled laws by which rational, free agents are governed. In consequence of this arrange∣ment, the sentiment of St. Paul was fully justifi∣ed, <HI>the weakness of God is stronger, and the foolish∣ness of God is wiser than man.</HI> By instruments apparently the most feeble; from causes the most improbable, he has displayed the strongest tokens of his goodness to mankind. He hath bestowed the most valuable legacy (with deference be it spoken) which it was in his power to confer on the work of his hands.</P>
<P>Of the truth of the last assertion we shall be sufficiently persuaded, from the observations which will occur in the second head of discourse.</P>
<P N="2">II. Let us take a summary view of the advan∣tages, which mankind have derived from the ex∣ample of Jesus Christ, and the principles of his religion. <HI>Behold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be unto all people.</HI></P>
<P>Here we may make a pertinent enquiry, what changes have taken place in the religion, mo∣ral habits and customs of men, in consequence of the coming of Christ, and at the same time de∣monstrate the superiority of the motives to piety and social virtue, which are derived from our holy religion.</P>
<P N="1">1. To the gospel mankind are indebted for that first and grand article of all true religion, the UNITY OF GOD. This truth had not only been
<PB N="13" REF="034645_0011_0FFF451780F1AF18"/>
obscured, but obliterated by idolatry. Although the religion of the Jews, as delivered by Moses, made this a principal and positive article in their creed; yet their frequent relapses into the idolatry of other nations, and the very unworthy notions of the di∣vine attributes, that were admitted among their traditions, prove that they, as well as all the rest of human kind, stood in need of a teacher, who, by a divine warrant and by divine authority, should give them a proper view of the subject. Granting this to be the case, with a people fa∣voured with a pure though partial revelation of the Deity, we may very naturally conclude, that in nations and countries walking by the light of nature, it would be far worse. History confirms us in this supposition. For not merely the heaven∣ly bodies, the sun, moon and stars; but deceased princes and heroes, benefactors or tyrants of mankind, yea the beasts of the field, and the in∣animate parts of creation, received those honours which are alone due to the Governor of heaven and earth. Who can reckon up the number of human victims, which were sacrificed, either to procure their favour, or to appease their wrath? Was there a passion or appetite, however black or polluted, lurking in the heart of man, but re∣ceived a religious consecration, and was made a part of divine worship? The ears of the chaste would be wounded at the recital of the impure and abominable, those of the humane and com∣passionate, with that of the infernal barbarities of the pagan rites. A bare allusion to many of them would be too indecorous for an assembly of Chris∣tians. Such facts did however exist, as to justi∣fy the description of them by St. Paul in his epis∣tles. <HI>Professing themselves to be wise they became
<PB N="14" REF="034645_0012_0FFF45190582A118"/>
fools, their foolish hearts were darkened, they were given up to a reprobate mind, they changed the glo∣ry of the invisible God, to the likeness of corruptible man, to beasts, to birds and reptiles.</HI> As far therefore, as the primitive religion of nature, which comprizes the idea of one God, and him infinitely powerful, wise and good, is preferable to the <HI>abominations of the heathen,</HI> with all their brutal and barbarous modes of worship; as far as mankind have been enlightened in these doctrines by the gospel, so far I affirm we are indebted to the birth and ministry of Jesus Christ for the light and knowledge we enjoy. We shall offer no other argument in favour of our last assertion, than by asking, in the language of a late learned and eminent writer,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Thomas Sherlock, Bishop of London.</HI></NOTE><Q>In what nation, city or even village, has the doctrine of one eternal God been publicly taught, except among the Jews, previous to the commencement of Chris∣tianity?</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. The state of the heathen morality, compar∣ed with that of the gospel, will give us a further view of the superior advantages we enjoy. The belief that we are accountable to a being, who is infinitely pure and holy, who will reward the most secret acts of goodness, and punish vice whether secret or open, is I say common to eve∣ry denomination of Christians, however they may differ from each other in modes of worship. To do justly, to love mercy, and to walk hum∣bly, to do to others as we would that others should do to us, to forgive our enemies, and, as far as is consistent with self preservation, to re∣store them to our affections, to harbour no ma∣lignity in our hearts, neither to envy the rich, nor
<PB N="15" REF="034645_0013_0FFF451AAB932AA8"/>
despise the poor, to visit the afflicted, the friend∣less and the destitute, and relieve their necessi∣ties, to conduct in every relation of life as a good neighbour and a good citizen, to be severe and critical in examining our own conduct, to exer∣cise charity, candour and moderation to all others, these are truth, which were taught by the pre∣cepts, and exemplified in the life of our blessed Saviour. Compare for a moment the principles and morals here laid down, with those of the heathen world, where revenge was in many places considered as a virtue, where patriotism was but a faction against the liberty and happiness of eve∣ry country but their own, where men were in no capacity to learn truth or purity of conduct from their laws, from their philosophers, or from their social institutions, where the violation of virtue or decency was scarce thought worthy of a slight reproof, much less of a legal prohibi∣tion, where every crime against the peace of so∣ciety or individuals could be justified from the ex∣ample of their Gods.</P>
<P>I am aware it will be objected, that the writings of many eminent men among the heathen recom∣mended the practise of the social virtues, and exhibited sublime sentiments of piety, in some re∣spects not inferior to those delivered in the New Testament. But in reply, it may be said, that their influence and authority was greatly circum∣scribed, and there was such a mixture of the re∣ligious traditions of their country, as rendered it impossible that any general body of ethics should be collected from them. We do not wish to de∣preciate their characters. We admire the efforts of their minds, labouring under so many disad∣vantages. That the academy at Athens and the
<PB N="16" REF="034645_0014_0FFF451F6D93F800"/>
public school at Sparta produced men of shining parts and romantic virtues, we do not deny; but let us look for a moment into the private manners of their best disciples; how very remote were they from uniform morality! In one instance we know that the government of the civilized world was left to one of the most eminent philosophers of all antiquity. Yet when supreme power was united with the highest degrees of human wisdom and dignity of character, that it produced no ge∣neral change for the better. It scarcely cleansed the polluted atmosphere of the court.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let us consider the alteration in human laws and customs, by the propagation of the gospel.</P>
<P>Under the heathen system, slavery or death was the usual consequence of being vanquished in war. This warranted the most internal cruelty in the conqueror, and the most obstinate resist∣ance in the vanquished. But the gospel, by the doctrine of forgiving enemies, recommending them as objects of our love, has softened the se∣rocious passions of men, changed the stern coun∣tenance of war, and in an infinity of examples bettered the condition of mankind. It has made good the pretensions of its divine Author, who declared, that he came to bring deliverance unto the captives, the opening of the prison to them that were bound, and to loose those that were ap∣pointed unto death. Equally salutary were the consequences of the gospel, by which polygamy was abolished, and the affections and senses of men restrained within such limits, as from their tendency, promote friendship, mutual confidence, and the care of posterity. In a word, by liberat∣ing the fairer part of creation from the dominion
<PB N="17" REF="034645_0015_0FFF4522392A1820"/>
of lawless appetites, by rendering the state of mar∣riage honourable and mutually advantageous, the source of innumerable private blessings; where every man's home would be an asylum amidst the cares and trials of life, where he might find the partner and companion of his heart instead of the slave of sensual appetite.</P>
<P>I add, that the constituion of the gospel is highly favourable to the abolition of personal sla∣very. Its most sacred mysteries are communicat∣ed equally to the rich and poor, to the master and servant. The sentiment that every man is ac∣countable for his actions at the tribunal of Jesus Christ, that no distinctions will be admitted but those of a moral nature, the doctrine delivered by the holy apostle St. Paul, <HI>that in Christ there is neither bond nor free, but all one,</HI> could not but have made a deep impression, and procured a de∣cisive influence on all, who embrace that holy system, to treat all mankind as brothers. It must from its tendency have inculcated the principles of liberty and equality, so far as they can exist consistently with order and the social compact.</P>
<P>In addition to those last mentioned, may we not ascribe to our holy religion the benefits which arise from literature, commerce and resinement, which have rendered Christian countries so far superior to the other parts of the globe? The care and pains with which the inspired writings were preserved, rendered the original languages, in which they were written, absolutely necessary to be known, and the duties of devotion per∣formed in the Latin language throughout Europe for many generations, were means in the hands of Providence for preserving the noble composi∣tions
<PB N="18" REF="034645_0016_0FFF4524C8E93060"/>
of the ancients from destruction, under the great eclipse of literature by the invasion of the Goths and Vandals in the West, and the Scythi∣ans and Arabs in the East, who effected the de∣struction of the Roman Empire. Otherwise, for any cause we can assign, the arts and sciences would have been buried in the ruins of the Ro∣man government. The civilized parts of Europe would have known no resurrection of literature, but would in all probability have been as barba∣rous and brutal, as those nations on the extremi∣ty of Asia or America, which have been visited by modern navigators.</P>
<P N="4">4. Let us consider the superior motives, by which we are excited to moral virtue under the gospel, to what were ever laid before mankind previous to that dispensation. The doctrine of par∣don upon penitence, the sufficency of the Sav∣iour's expiation to compensate for our imperfect nature, and to raise us to a sphere of existence far beyond what the most perfect innocence could have hoped for from natural religion, have their origin in the New Testament. But, lest such indulgence should be a foundation for licentious∣ness, and counteract the purity of the Christian doctrines, we are assured that the Supreme Being will admit none to his favour, till, subdued by divine grace, and clothed with humble reliance upon his goodness, both their hearts and habits are changed.</P>
<P>But among all the visible effects of the gospel, none are more worthy our grateful commemo∣ration, than the doctrine of the immortality of the soul, and the resurrection of the dead. Hu∣man laws and penalties from large experience are
<PB N="19" REF="034645_0017_0FFF4528640FFAB8"/>
proved to be insufficient either to encourage the good or to awe and reclaim the wicked, unless aided by the hopes and fears of another life, in which reward and punishment will be adjusted, not according to the promiscuous plan of Provi∣dence in this state, but by the everlasting princi∣ples of truth and righteousness. In this there∣fore man in a social view has reaped innumerable benefits from the coming of Christ. What might be considered a probability from the natural hopes of mankind, and the writings of great and good men not inspired, in consequence of the evidences and light of our holy religion, may be viewed as a moral certainty. If in the present mixed state all things come alike to all, and there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; if the sinner be clothed in purple and fare sumptuous∣ly every day, and the true child of virtue is de∣prived of the common bounties of heaven, our holy religion assures us, that in a very short time this scene will be shifted, the former will be com∣forted, the latter punished. Vice will be stripped of its false ornaments and its crown. Persecuted, conflicting, and persevering goodness will be re∣served to adorn the triumph of the Redeemer at the great day. These hopes of our holy religion have banished the fears of silence and perpetual sleep. They teach us, that He, who was raised from the dead, will illuminate us through the dark valley of the shadow of death, and intro∣duce us to the paternal mansions he had prepar∣ed, where are collected the wise and good of all past ages, whose numbers will constantly aug∣ment to the conclusion of time. If these doc∣trines give a relish to prosperity, how much more
<PB N="20" REF="034645_0018_0FFF452AF5692438"/>
necessary are they for the unfortunate? If they are a stimulus to virtue, are they not still more wanted as a check upon the wicked?</P>
<P>Here, my brethren, you see a small part of the glorious events, that have taken place in conse∣quence of the birth and advent of the Redeemer to the world. Might not the celestial messenger, more especially when unfolding the dark volumes of futurity, he foresaw the splendour of the spi∣ritual throne of David, and those blessings to the human kind which originated from the gospel, be justified in declaring, <HI>I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be unto all people.</HI> Well might his celestial attendants respond to his senti∣ments, <HI>glory to God in the highest, peace on earth, and good will towards men.</HI> Well might the aged and venerable prophet, inspired with more than mortal joy, sing his "nunc dimittis:" <HI>Permit thy servant to depart, for mine eyes have seen the salvation, which thou hast prepared before the face of all people.</HI></P>
<P>I now hasten, in the <HI>third</HI> place, to offer a few reflections.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Something will be expected concerning the religious festival itself. A question of this kind will naturally arise in your mind, why, if the birth of Christ be attended with so many ad∣vantages to mankind, should not this day be ho∣noured with religious solemnity? Wherefore have our ancestors of the New-England states, who founded our churches, refused it that honour and notice paid by all other Christians? In reply, un∣der patience and candour of the audience, I shall give you some among the more important of their objections, adding at the same time some senti∣ments of my own.</P>
<Q><PB N="21" REF="034645_0019_0FFF452D899FDA18"/>
<P>In the first place,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These objections I have stated in my own language, from reading and recollection.</NOTE> the day has never been identified with such correctness, as to warrant its observation, Were we to determine by the time in which Zacharias officiated in the tem∣ple, we could gain no light upon the subject, because the order and rank of priests were va∣ried at the pleasure of the Roman Governors. In the next place, all their public records pe∣rished with their temple. Should it be com∣puted by the Roman census, when Cyrenius was president of Syria, that period is placed by some expositors at an earlier season of the year. To the last objection may be added another; that of <HI>shepherds feeding their flocks by night.</HI> Though Palestine be in a climate much warmer than our own, yet such an employ∣ment was improbable at that late season of the year. To this perhaps their successors would add, that the reformation of the calendar half a century ago, has caused a variation of eleven days in the time of its celebration.</P>
<P>They further objected, that the festival is enjoined neither by Christ nor his apostles in any part of the New Testament, that there are no traces to be found of it in the early and pure ages of the church; from whence they drew this inference, that at an after period it was substituted for some pagan festival, after the church had become corrupt.</P>
<P>They considered it as a festival enjoined by human authority, and therefore, as they dis∣puted all pretensions of that kind, as invading
<PB N="22" REF="034645_0020_0FFF4530343E4480"/>
the kingdom of Christ, they on that account refused it any particular notice or honour.</P>
<P>Lastly, it is probable, from the rigour and severity of their principles, they might dislike the manner in which it was observed by the ig∣norant and unthinking part of the community, and might therefore view it as productive of dissipation and indecent mirth, and consequent∣ly hostile to the interests of piety and virtue.</P></Q>
<P>These arguments have been recited rather to gratify the hearers than with a view or wish for polemical discussion. The greater part of them at the present day, considering the mutual good sense of those who deny or admit their weight, are of very little consequence. I conceive the fame∣ness of the day is given up on all hands by the present Gregorian calendar. Good men we are sensible may differ in their opinions how far a power enjoining a positive act of worship, unex∣ceptionable in itself, may be lodged in the church. But at the same time, however different their ap∣prehensions of the lawfulness of the authority, they may all perform the same acts of worship from different motives. Some may view the cele∣bration of this day as an act of piety, because it has its origin in venerable antiquity, and is sup∣ported by the example of the greater part of the Christian world. Others, from voluntary effu∣sion of gratitude to the memory of Christ. A third party, having no objections to offer, may esteem it a mark of charity and catholicism to unite in the devotion of their fellow Christians.</P>
<P>If it be admitted by the candid and moderate of both parties, that some day should be set apart for this purpose, I think we may infer, that the
<PB N="23" REF="034645_0021_0FFF4531EBC1B8A0"/>
practice of the churches of England and Geneva, the Protestant churches in Germany, the Greek churches in Asia and Europe, which last com∣prize the religion of the Russian Empire, should give a decided preference to the present time.</P>
<P>For my own part, though I have the highest veneration for the founders of the New-England churches, yet I conceive it may be possible that, with hearts filled with piety, they might vi∣brate to an extreme in lesser matters. As a mere <HI>human</HI> and compulsive injunction, I should pro∣test against the observation of the day. But as a free-will-offering to the Lord Jesus Christ, as a voluntary honour to the season of his birth, I could heartily wish, that every temple consecrat∣ed to the most high God throughout the land were opened to commemorate, with proper sensi∣bility and fervent gratitude, the benevolence of the Deity in sending a Saviour. Certainly the thousands, nay millions of sincere Christian pro∣fessors, engaged in this holy act of devotion and piety, would warm and elevate our religious af∣fections. For just is the observation of the wise man, <HI>iron sharpeneth iron, so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>second place,</HI> the day itself may lead us to some collateral reflections on the advantages of such religious institutions as occasion pleasure to the mind, and admit of some entertainment to the senses. It may be justly offered in their de∣fence, that when limited by a strict veneration for religion and its Author, restrained by deco∣rum from sensual excesses, when they neither are allowed to promote idolatry, or trespass on the calls of common life, they deserve reverence and
<PB N="24" REF="034645_0022_0FFF4535D02898C0"/>
attention not only from the devout man, but even from the good citizen. The Deity in the abstract is too sublime for our conceptions. His original cannot be investigated by the most pro∣found thought or elevated powers of the human soul. We therefore form our ideas of him from the noblest images of created excellence; from the best moral and intelligent qualities of the mind. These, though infinitely short of his essence, yet are necessary aids to assist us in the duties of piety. For <HI>who can by searching find out God, who can find out the Almighty to perfec∣tion? It is high as heaven, what canst thou do? Deeper than bell, what canst thou know? The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broad∣er than the sea.</HI> The Almighty, therefore, in exhibiting himself to his creatures, has conde∣scended to the present frame and condition of man. Accordingly he manifested himself to his ancient people by visible demonstrations of his power. To Adam under the representation of a man walking in the garden in the cool of the day; to Moses and the people of Israel by a pil∣lar of light; and afterwards to the same people by the Shechinah, which was a symbol of his power and presence, residing between the Che∣rubims. Last of all, he manifested himself to mankind by his Son, <HI>the brightness of his glory,</HI> designed as a very picture of himself, through which they might adore him. From these facts we inser, that though idolatry is justly to be re∣probated, yet from the nature of mankind, re∣ligion ought, in some measure, to be adapted to the senses. And we are justified in this obser∣vation by the words of the apostle, <HI>wherein he
<PB N="25" REF="034645_0023_0FFF453756142150"/>
directs, to glorify God not only with our spirits, but with our bodies which are his.</HI></P>
<P>Social worship, the observation of the Sabbath, Baptism, and the Lord's Supper, are essential, in the present order of nature, for the preservation of the Christian system. We therefore find each of these strictly enjoined, either by precept or example, in the New Testament. Our annual Fasts and Thanksgivings, considered as volunta∣ry homage to the Supreme Being, deprecating his displeasure, soliciting his protection, and ac∣knowledging his past goodness, are not venera∣ble merely for being coeval with the settlement of the country; but are customs wise and good in themselves. Very few are there, who are so capable of contemplation, as to support internal religion, if all public forms should be laid aside. Of these, none are more pleasing than such as awaken a cheerful gratitude to God, or lead us to meditate on such parts of the divine conduct, as are in the highest degree interesting to our∣selves.</P>
<P>This subject is more important, than we should at first suppose. For it may be an enquiry wor∣thy of wise and good men, whether the gloomy medium, through which religion has been viewed by many in the land, hath not had a tendency to promote insidelity or despair? Whether it may not have been productive of the horrors of fanat∣icism, arising from the most unworthy notions of the divine character, on the one hand; or on the other, of that irrational exuberant enthusiasm, so hostile to order and decency in public worship; <HI>the parent of confusion and every evil work?</HI> Were I compelled to choose, I should rather adopt a
<PB N="26" REF="034645_0024_0FFF453AEF394F48"/>
religion admitting as sacred rites sports and pas∣times perfectly innocent, than one holding up to view our <HI>Heavenly Father</HI> as an implacable ty∣rant, enacting laws impossible to be obeyed, and for their <HI>necessary</HI> violation, inflicting punishments unspeakably severe, infinitely disproportional, and terrible beyond conception; and, furthermore, representing his favour as conciliated by no other means, than by sacrificing, to what is blasphem∣ously stiled his glory, the love of our proper nature implanted in us by himself, and by a cheerful acquiescence in suffering <HI>the vengeance of eternal fire</HI> to expiate the unpardonable crime of our existence.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The pleasing union of different de∣nominations of Christians in the solemnities of the day leads me to remark, that the variety of <HI>sects</HI> in the Christian world, although considered as a defect, are essential, in the present order of things, for the preservation of religion and morality. Did our nature and circumstances admit, nothing would be more grateful to a pious mind, than that all the children of Adam, with one mode, heart and tongue, should pay their devout ac∣knowledgments to their common Parent and Be∣nefactor. But from dear bought experience we find, that all attempts to introduce uniformity in matters of religion have not only been ineffi∣cient, but productive of infinite evils in society. <Q>A variety of religious denominations may, for aught we know, be the most suitable to the unsearchable nature of the Deity.</Q> It is mo∣rally certain, however, that it is a necessary check on superstition, and promotes a laudable emula∣tion among different sects to rival one another
<PB N="27" REF="034645_0025_0FFF453D8B744BF8"/>
in animated devotion, and purity of conduct. If a single sect, however pure and honest in their intentions, should prevail so far as to exclude a toleration of others, it would soon resemble a great body of stagnant water, which, by becom∣ing corrupted, emits polluted air and pestilential vapours. The pure principles of Christianity would become contaminated by a communication with the interests of this world. The churches might encrease in the splendour of their appearance, but internal piety and the majesty of holiness would vanish. The generous and liberal provi∣sion, devoted for the purposes of public instruc∣tion, would eventually become the exclusive pat∣rimony of pride, indolence, and interest with the great, instead of the rewards of true godliness, strict morality, and literary labour.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> While we contemplate the blessings which have flowed from the birth of the Saviour, let us not forget to praise God for the light and knowledge of the present day, for the reforma∣tions in religion by reducing it to its primitive sim∣plicity. Within two centuries what a happy change! The iron hand of persecution is not on∣ly maimed, but we hope stricken off from the trunk. The United States of America are add∣ed to the list of Christian nations, who, to the blessings of religion in its native simplicity, have added such free and glorious constitutions of civil government, as have exhibited the highest point to which human felicity can be carried. The most free and rational enquiries on civil and reli∣gious subjects are not only allowed, but invited. The four, unsocial spirit of bigotry is obliged to lay aside its former insolence, and disguise its
<PB N="28" REF="034645_0026_0FFF45401E57B340"/>
nature, or retreat to the habitations of ignorance and folly. And it is with pleasure I can an∣nounce, that the liberal and catholic spirit among Christians of different opinions at the present day, reflects high honour on our common gospel. We feel, and may we ever feel its blessed effects! Let us then lay aside all bitterness, and even cool∣ness and shyness to one another; like <Q>brethren of the same family of different christian names.</Q> Let our only zeal and emulation be, to excel each other in piety, and in the practice of those virtues that embellish and dignify human life.</P>
<P>Our own age has been pregnant with won∣ders. From causes little contemplated, the most surprizing revolutions have taken place in the old world. Already superstition has fallen from her basis. On her ruins has been erected the short but abominable dominion of atheism. The vota∣ries of the former we hope will be convinced by their intercourse with foreign countries, that they have seen Christianity through a false medium. The advocates of the latter have, by a dreadful experiment, been convinced of these eternal truths, <HI>that man was made to worship God, and that society cannot subsist without religion.</HI></P>
<P>But however these important commotions may operate on the minds of men in those parts of the globe where they exist, I sincerely pray they may have a tendency to excite in us a love and reverence for the religious institutions of our country. Look to the effects of that piety and those manly virtues for which our venerable an∣cestors were renowned. Behold them in the nu∣merous and beautiful fabrics erected to the ho∣nour and worship of God, in our universities, in
<PB N="29" REF="034645_0027_0FFF4541AE2877A0"/>
our public schools of learning, in the rapid pro∣gress of the arts and sciences, in all the comforts and even elegancies of life, in their industry, and those improvements, which have rendered our land the praise and joy of all the earth, in a com∣munity the most moral and enlightened of any known from the creation to the present day; religion, I say the religion of Jesus was the soul that animated all their labours, and converted a gloomy wilderness to a paradise for their offspring.</P>
<P>These are sufficient causes, my brethren, why we should venerate the religion delivered by Jesus Christ;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LG>
<L>—<HI>Non haec solemnia nobis,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Vana superstitio veterumve ignora deorum,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Imposuit.</HI></L>
</LG>
<BIBL>Virgil, Ae. viii. 185.</BIBL></NOTE> why we should look upon it not as a vain and popular superstition, but as the noblest inheritance we have derived from our fathers, as a tie of common confidence, equally a bulwark and ornament of our country.</P>
<P>While we see the partial effects of the Redeem∣er's kingdom thus salutary to mankind, what may we not infer, when he shall consummate his kingdom in the new heavens and earth which shall be prepared for his residence! <HI>When the bo∣dy of sin shall be destroyed,</HI> and nature, purged from her ancient contagion, shall be restored to her primitive innocence and glory! When his right hand shall slay the crooked serpent, and the brightness of his coming shall scatter and destroy the effects of death and natural evil! These things may appear distant to us; but he who has pro∣mised is faithful. From the honour and veracity of his character, it would be impious to question the assurance that is given, that the kingdoms of this world should become the kingdoms of our
<PB N="30" REF="034645_0028_0FFF45434CA9CE58"/>
Lord and of his Christ, and he shall reign fore∣ver and ever.</P>
<P>Animated and inspired by these hopes, let me conjure you to pour forth your warmest affections, your sincerest gratitude, to the infant of Bethle∣hem. What a triumph did our nature receive, when perfect holiness in the person of Immanuel came and dwelt in flesh! <Q>When he overcame the sharpness of death, he opened the kingdom of heaven to all true believers.</Q> Let the in∣cense you now offer to your great Friend and Be∣nefactor, be sincere piety, accompanied with a humble and contrite spirit. Trust me when I as∣sure you, that this will be a more acceptable pre∣sent to the great Judge of hearts, than thousands and tens of thousands of victims, which you might offer, or shrines and temples of the highest beau∣ty and magnificence, which you should erect in honour of his memory.</P>
