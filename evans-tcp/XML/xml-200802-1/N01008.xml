<HEAD>Abraham the Passenger HIS Privilege &amp; Duty.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>GENESIS. XII. 2.</BIBL>
<Q>And I will make of thee a great Nation, and I will Bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a Blessing.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN the World was deeply immerst in Idolatry, God was pleased from his Sovereign pleasure, to call some out of darkness into his marvellous light, shedding down upon them the Saving and Regenerating influences of his Spirit, whereby they were enabled willingly to turn from Idols to Serve him, who is the true and living God.</P>
<P>Amongst the famous Worthies that the Sacred History makes men∣tion of in the new World, was <HI>Abraham;</HI> who lived about the Twenty first Century from the Creation: He by the abundant Grace of God bestowed upon him, exceeded all, in those two comprehensive Graces, <HI>viz.</HI> a fixed <HI>Faith,</HI> and a filial <HI>Fear.</HI> In <HI>Faith,</HI> in that he readily be∣lieved all Gods Promises, which seem'd to have insuperable difficul∣ties in the way of their accomplishment; <HI>Who against hope believed in hope, and staggered not at the Promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving Glory unto God,</HI> Rom. 4. 18, 19, 20. Hereupon that hono∣rable Title, <HI>the Father of the faithful,</HI> was given unto him.</P>
<P>He had such an awful fear of God, as that he stuck at nothing in
<PB N="2" REF="001205_0003_0FB133C718654510"/>
order to a compliance with his revealed Will: as it appears in his ready submitting himself to that Painful Ordinance of Circumcision; he being then well nigh an hundred years old: in offering up his only begotten Son by <HI>Sarah</HI> as a Sacrifice; which is testifyed from Heaven by an Angel, <HI>Gen.</HI> 22. 12. And also in leaving his Native Country, and Kindred, at the Command of God.</P>
<P>This his Country was <HI>Ur</HI> of the <HI>Chaldees,</HI> which lay between those two great and noble Rivers <HI>Euphrates</HI> and <HI>Tygris,</HI> therefore called in the Hebrew Tongue, <HI>Aram-Naharajim,</HI> or <HI>Padan-Aram:</HI> and in the <HI>Greek</HI> Tongue, <HI>Mesopotamia,</HI> whereabouts was the Garden of <HI>Eden,</HI> or Paradise; as some Learned men judge. Though this Country was blessed with a fertile Soil; when God orders his removal, he present∣ly attends his pleasure, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> himself with his Family and Kindred to <HI>Haran:</HI> and from thence to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>;</HI> which might be about four hundred Miles: His call is set down Verse the first; which was given to him in <HI>Mesopotamia;</HI> an account of which we have in <HI>Act.</HI> 7. 2, 3. That this was an Evidence of Faith and Fear, is declared by the Author to the <HI>Hebrews, Chap.</HI> 11. 8.</P>
<P><HI>In trans<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tu,</HI> Two things seem not unworthy of our consideration; <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That Gods People are sometimes called by Him, to remove from the places of their Nativity, into a Country afar off.</HI> This call of God is not now Immediate, as <HI>Abraham'</HI>s was: but Mediate; namely, when they can∣not Live comfortably where they are, and have a plain prospect of mending themselves in another Land; as in this Chapter, it is related that <HI>Abraham</HI> went down into <HI>Egypt</HI> upon the account of the <HI>Famine</HI> in <HI>Canaan,</HI> without any Immediate Command from God. So <HI>Lot</HI> re∣moved himself from <HI>Abraham;</HI> they not being able, by reason of the Multitude of their Cattel, to Live Peaceably together. Or when they cannot enjoy the Ordinances of God with Peace and Purity: this Lat∣ter was the case of our Pious Predecessors, the first Planters of this Land: Many of which had fair Accommodations, and very conside∣rable Estates; who yet for the Satisfaction of their Consciences, ac∣counted it far more eligible to turn their backs upon all the good things, in their own Native Country, and expose themselves and their Families to great hazards, and difficulties, by Sea and Land; than to abide where they were. Surely, it was not to gain great Estates: but for the promotion of Religion, and the advancement of their own and their Posterities Spiritual good, that was in their Eyes; which made them to come from a fruitful Land, into this <HI>Jeshimon,</HI> and un∣cultivated Wilderness. And God was in a signal manner present with
<PB N="3" REF="001205_0004_0FB133C8A3B795D0"/>
them, who obtained their desired end, in the peaceable enjoyment of Gods Ordinances; and having all of them ascended into those glo∣rious Regions that are above, have left their Posterity in possession of the good things of Gods House; which we yet through the bounty of our Merciful God, enjoy without molestation and rigorous Impo∣sitions.</P>
<P>Will it not now be an hazardous attempt in any, to introduce that into our Congregations, which is diametrically opposite to the great end of our Worthy and Religious Fathers, in their coming over into this Wilderness? (<HI>v.</HI> 3.) Who did not separate from the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as denying it to be a true Church; their departure from thence was an orderly Secession, having the Countenance and Encourage∣ment of the Supreme Authority of our Nation. Therefore they did not deserve to be Stigmatiz'd with that ill title of Schismaticks.</P>
<P>But have we not cause to bewail the irreligious folly of many that have planted themselves in such remote corners of this Land, for the sake of Worldly conveniencies, that they might live as Lambs in a large place; so as that they have not been capable of enjoying the Ordi∣nances of Christ, and by that means have seemed to bid defiance, not only to Religion, but to Civility it self: and such places thereby have become Nurseries of Ignorance, Prophaneness and Atheism. But hath not God left upon them the marks of his sore displeasure? whereby many such places are become ruinous heaps; upon which God hath in Righteousness stretched the line of confusion, and stones of emptiness.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another thing observable is: <HI>That complyance with the revealed. Will of God,</HI> is <HI>usually followed with manifold Blessings.</HI> These Words as they stand related and are tack'd to the first Verse, plainly hold forth this Truth: there are none that do any Service for God, but they are rewarded for it. <HI>In keeping thy Commands there is great Reward,</HI> Psal. 19. 11. This our Saviour with Solemnity declares, Luk. 18. 29, 30. <HI>Verily, I say unto you, there is no man, that hath left House or Parents or Brethren, or Wife or Children, for the Kingdom of Gods sake, who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the World to come Life Everlasting.</HI></P>
<P>When men Serve and obey God, though not in a sincere manner, yet they have not miss'd of a reward from God: as <HI>Jehu,</HI> who at the Command of God destroyed the house of <HI>Ahab,</HI> and the Worship∣pers of <HI>Baal,</HI> which he did with respect to his own Worldly Interest; yet his Posterity, according to that promise of God, Sat upon the Throne of <HI>Israel</HI> to the fourth Generation. And <HI>Nebuchadnezz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r</HI> did
<PB N="4" REF="001205_0005_0FB133CA177D84F0"/>
Service for God in ruining the proud City of <HI>Tyre,</HI> where little Booty was found that might countervail his great pains and labour: He therefore gave him the rich and opulent Kingdom of <HI>Egypt;</HI> as it is fully expressed in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 29. 17. <HI>ad finem.</HI> Then surely such as obey God in an upright manner, they shall not miss of a full Recompence. If we look back into the Old World we shall find two Persons that did Eminent Service for God, <HI>viz. Enoch</HI> and <HI>Noah,</HI> who walkt with Him, and trod <HI>Antipodes</HI> to that licentious World, refusing to run with them in the same excess of Riot. Those were signally owned and re∣warded; the one was personally translated into Heaven; and the other with his Family preserved, when by that universal Deluge, the whole race of Mankind were swept away.</P>
<P>Sometimes God confers Riches upon such as obey him; as he did upon <HI>Abraham, David,</HI> and many others: and such as have not much in the World, what little they have, is accompanyed with a Blessing, and their Spirits are well satisfyed with what they have. Indeed the shortest way to be rich, is not by enlarging our <HI>Estates;</HI> but by con∣tracting our <HI>Desires.</HI> Upon such God bestows <HI>Honour,</HI> as it is promised, 1 Sam. 2. 30. <HI>For them that honour me, I will honour.</HI> Prov. 3. 16. <HI>In her left hand are riches and honour.</HI> There is a silent Dignity in reproached Piety; and a silent Ignominy, in exalted Iniquity. <HI>Herod feared John knowing that he was a just man,</HI> Mark. 6. 20. Such also have Spiritual pleasures having quietness and tranquillity of mind; that fear of God that passeth all understanding, keeps their hearts: This is a blessing that far surmounts all Earthly enjoyments. <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Habakkuk</HI> could sit and sing, when great troubles were surrounding them. <HI>Psal.</HI> 17. <HI>Hab.</HI> 3. These keep a constant Jubilee in their own bosomes.</P>
<P>In a word Eternal Life will be the issue, and happy result of a right Obeying of God. This the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> expected when about to bid Farewel to the World, 2 Tim. 4. 7, 8. <HI>I have fought a good fight</HI> There∣fore there is <HI>laid up for me a Crown of righteousness.</HI> Yea, this is promi∣sed, <HI>Rev.</HI> 2. 10. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e faithful to the Death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life.</HI> And so Servants, that obey Christ in their places, <HI>Col.</HI> 3. 24. How should this excite all Persons, especially Superiours, to Obey the Com∣mands of God: they should be stedfast, &amp; immoveable in ways of Well-doing, knowing that their labour will not be in vain; for God will not deny his Word; but will give a full accomplishment to his promises. Godliness hath the promise of the Life that now is, and that which is to come: as we find it accomplished unto <HI>Abraham,</HI> according to the promises that he here makes to him in the words read.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="001205_0006_0FB133CCE7F8F8A0"/>
Which are compounded of a <HI>Promise</HI> and a <HI>Precept.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Here is a copious <HI>Promise.</HI> God having called <HI>Abraham</HI> from his own Country, doth not leave him destitute: He gives him a Country far better than that which he left; which he plainly promiseth, <HI>Gen.</HI> 12. 1. And is necessarily implied in this Promise of a numerous Poste∣rity, or making him a great Nation, as the Stars of Heaven, as the Dust of the Earth, <HI>Gen.</HI> 13. 10. He engageth that he will bestow upon him <HI>Spiritual</HI> Blessings. <HI>I will bless thee;</HI> that is <HI>Spiritually.</HI> He farther promiseth to make him a great Name. <HI>Name</HI> in Scripture, hath a dou∣ble acceptation; and so it denotes (1.) <HI>Dignity, viz.</HI> Riches, Emi∣nency of Parts and Gifts, nobleness of Birth; so it may be taken in <HI>Gen.</HI> 6. 4. They were men of <HI>Renown,</HI> and as the Hebrew hath it, Men of <HI>NAME, Numb.</HI> 16. 2. (2.) <HI>Authority;</HI> So <HI>Name</HI> is frequently ta∣ken in Scripture, as in that form used in the Administration of Bap∣tism, <HI>Phil.</HI> 2. 10. <HI>Acts</HI> 3. 6. &amp; 4. 17. These two are separable; Persons may be Honourable by virtue of their Birth, Breeding, and great E∣state, and yet destitute of Authority: Both these were bestowed on <HI>Abraham,</HI> who was endowed with Riches, both internal and external. He had also great Authority, who was a Ruler over a vast and nume∣rous Family; and the Sons of <HI>Heth</HI> call him Lord, and a very great Prince, which in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> is expressed by the Name of God, a <HI>Prince of God;</HI> that stands in the room of the superlative degree. And be sure, his Posterity, many of them, were Rulers and Kings, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17. 6.</P>
<P N="2">2. We have an express <HI>Precept; Thou shalt be a Blessing:</HI> Or as it is in the Original, <HI>Be thou a Blessing:</HI> and so it is rendred by <HI>Junius</HI> and <HI>Tye∣melius, Esto Benedictioni;</HI> were it in the future tense as it is translated, yet it may be lookt upon as a Command; for not only Negative Com∣mands are set down in the future tense, as in the <HI>Decalogue;</HI> but also Affirmative, as in <HI>Mal.</HI> 1. 6. where in the Original, it is in the future tense; <HI>A Son shall honour his Father, Mal.</HI> 2. 7. <HI>Lev.</HI> 19. 2. compared with 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 16.</P>
<P><HI>Abraham</HI> was to be a Blessing, not only in that he was to be the mediate Progenitor of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> in whom all the Nations of the Earth were to be blessed; but also he was to be a Blessing in his <HI>own</HI> per∣son, by his Usefulness to others, in the due improvement of the many temporal and spiritual blessings that in abundance God had bestowed upon him. There is a great difference in being blessed in a <HI>passive,</HI> and being a Blessing in an <HI>active</HI> sense. Many are <HI>blessed</HI> with Riches, excellent Gifts and Authority, but are not <HI>Blessings</HI> in their Places, but the contrary.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="001205_0007_0FB133CED0F629C0"/>
The words read, with what precedes, may admit of this Paraphrase: <HI>Abraham!</HI> <Q>I have exalted my self to shew mercy to thee, by giving thee an effectual Call, whereby thou art brought nigh to me; ma∣king a remarkable distinction between thee and many others, in con∣ferring upon thee my powerful Spirit, whereby thou art made wil∣ling to become a follower of me. And I have bound my self by ma∣ny great and precious Promises, that I will Crown thee with a nu∣merous Posterity, and advance thee to great Dignity and Authority, whereby thou wilt be advantaged with opportunity and ability of Glorifying my Name, and doing good to others: I do therefore expect, and peremptorily require thee, to the utmost of thy ability to be a rich Blessing unto all persons that thou standest related to.</Q></P>
<P>The words may be resolved into this short Proposition, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><LABEL>DOCTRINE.</LABEL>
<HI>That they who are Signally Blessed by GOD, are to be Blessings unto Men.</HI></P>
<P>Or, Such as God doth advance to places of Dignity and Authority; they are, in an especial manner, by a faithful improvement of them, to promote the Good of others.</P>
<P>There are three Assertions, which may be Prelimenary to what fol∣lows; which are plainly legible in the Text; <HI>Viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That GOD is the Author and Giver of every Blessing.</HI> As it is three times declared in the Words: He is the Father of Mercy; Every good and perfect gift comes down from God, <HI>Jam.</HI> 1. 17. Whatever Mercies are bestowed upon us; we are to acknowledge them to be the free and gratuitous gifts of God; the many pleasant streams of Mercy that flow in upon us, and follow us; they come down from Heaven; all our fresh Springs are in God. He gives large measures of Wisdom to some; whereby they are fitted to rule and govern others; and he exalteth men to high Places of Authority, <HI>Psal.</HI> 75. 6, 7. He sets a Crown upon the heads of some, vesting them with Supreme Authority, to whom he gives a Spirit of Government, as he did to <HI>Saul</HI> &amp; <HI>David.</HI> To others he gives power to become Rich, making their Labours successful: Hence we are to acknowledge God in all the Wayes of Mercy wherein he Walks towards us; rendering to him the Tribute of Praise; both Verbal, and
<PB N="7" REF="001205_0008_0FB133D076FE04A8"/>
Practical that is due unto Him. We must, with the Psalmist, say, <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t unto us, not unto us,</HI> but unto our Sovereign Lord be the Praise of all our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ollations of Good, and Salvations from Evil. The denial of this is Sa∣criledge, and a robbing of God.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>GOD, according to his Sovereign Wisdom,</HI> is pleased <HI>Variously to distri∣bute Blessings to the Children of Men.</HI> Upon some he bestows more, both of Internal and External Blessings, than he doth unto others: He doth not with an equal measure dispence his gifts, which will not render God justly chargeable with Unrighteousness, as though he were a Respecter of Persons. As God is Judge, with him there is no re∣spect of Persons, <HI>Act.</HI> 10. 36. The high as well as the low; the Prince as well as the Peasant shall fare alike; to them shall be distributed Rewards and Punishments according to the Nature of their doings, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2. 6. <HI>ad</HI> 12. <HI>Eph.</HI> 6. 8, 9. But as he is a Sovereign <HI>Benefactor,</HI> he gives out larger measures of Blessings to some, than he doth to others. <HI>In gratuitis non datur <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</HI> May not the High Possessor of Hea∣ven and Earth do with his <HI>own</HI> as he sees meet, <HI>Mat.</HI> 20. 15. Some God advanceth to high places of Dignity and Authority, whose Cups run over with an affluence of many good things, while others are kept in a low, mean and straitened state, <HI>Prov.</HI> 22. 2. <HI>The Rich and the Poor meet together, and the Lord is the maker of both;</HI> that is, not only of their <HI>Per∣sons,</HI> but also of their <HI>Condition.</HI> Some are abased, while others are e∣levated: He Crowns one with a Crown of <HI>Thorns,</HI> but another with a Crown of <HI>Gold:</HI> He puts a <HI>Scepter</HI> into the hand of one, and a <HI>Shovel</HI> into the hand of another. We cannot all be Top-branches, as a great Lord of our Nation once said. It is one of <HI>Solomons</HI> observations, <HI>Eccl.</HI> 10. 7. <HI>I have seen Servants on Horses, and Princes walking as Servants on the Earth:</HI> He calleth such as sit upon the <HI>Dunghil,</HI> advancing them to <HI>Thrones,</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 2. 8. Some ride upon the High Places of the Earth, when others are passing through the dark Valley of the Shadow of Death. Thus God dealt with <HI>Abraham,</HI> whom he exalted above many others: This is a plain evidence of Gods Soveraign Wisdom, and it is necessary for the upholding of Order amongst men: Did all stand upon a Level, there could not possibly be any Order; for Order is, <HI>AEqualium inaequaliumque apta dispositio;</HI> a fit disposing of equal &amp; ine∣qual; as gives to every thing and person their due and proper place.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>These Blessings which the Soveraign Hand of God bestows upon men, are to be improved so, as that they may be Blessings to all such as they stand related to.</HI> This is here called for and required. Thus did <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Nehe∣miah</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="001205_0009_0FB133D1A46F0AA8"/>
improve their Ability and Authority, for the furtherance of the good of others.</P>
<P>There are two Queries that call for an Answer, in order to the clearing up of this Truth before us.</P>
<P>Quest▪ <HI>Who they are that may be said to be Blessings, in the Improvement of the Signal Blessings of God bestowed on them?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ. In general:</HI> All truly Sanctifyed Ones, as <HI>Abraham</HI> was; who having the Image of God fairly drawn upon them, are made partakers of the Divine Nature: who being called out of the World, do not fashion themselves to a complyance with the Evil Customs &amp; Immoralities that are abounding: but are transformed in their Minds so as rightly to <HI>Know,</HI> and sincerely to <HI>Do</HI> the Holy Will of God: who labour to please God, and to walk worthy of his peculiar Grace bestowed upon them. These are Excellent Ones in whom God's Soul takes pleasure; for whose sake the World is upheld: These are God's <HI>Jewels,</HI> whom he so regards, that as long as they are here in the World, he will not destroy it; but will Exercise Pa∣tience to long Suffering; these are the <HI>Wheat,</HI> for the sake of which the <HI>Tares</HI> are not pluckt up, and burnt. These are the <HI>Pillars</HI> of the places where they Live. In a word, they are the <HI>Chariots</HI> and <HI>Horse∣men</HI> that defend the World; who by their Faith and Prayer stand in the Gap, as <HI>Moses</HI> did, to prevent the irruption and breaking in of Divine Wrath; and keep the gracious presence of God with them amongst whom they Live: This is intimated to us by the Prophet, <HI>Isa.</HI> 6. <HI>ult. The holy Seed shall be the substance thereof.</HI> The Word rendred <HI>Substance,</HI> signifyes a <HI>Pillar,</HI> which is made use of to support the building. Of this use, are Gods own People; who are called the holy Seed: Also that in <HI>Isa.</HI> 65. 8. Where there is an allusion to an Husbandman that espies some Grapes, which gives hopes of the recovery of the Vine; he then layes aside thoughts of cutting it down: So the Saints of God are a Blessing; for whose sake he will spare a People, and not utterly destroy them. It is often said, that for <HI>David'</HI>s sake he would continue the Kingdom of <HI>Judah.</HI> And we know, that for <HI>Paul's</HI> sake, near three hundred Souls were Saved, <HI>Act.</HI> 27. 24. Others, that are not truely gracious, being in high Places of Authority, may have their hearts so wrought upon by the powerful Spirit of God, as that they may be Useful and Serviceable. <HI>The Earth helped the Woman,</HI> Rev. 12. 16. that is, (as it is interpreted by some) great Rulers that had little or no Religion in them; for their own ends were helpful to the Church
<PB N="9" REF="001205_0010_0FB133D34296B840"/>
of God. So <HI>Cyrus</HI> and <HI>Darius,</HI> were very useful to the People of God in promoting their return to their own Land, and rebuilding of the Temple. Particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Such as are Religious, who set an high Value and Price upon the Ordi∣nances and Institutions of our Lord Jesus Christ, and are Willing to further and promote them.</HI> Such an one was <HI>Abraham,</HI> who, wherever he came, set up Altars unto God, to Worship him, and call upon his Name: The Word which is translated <HI>Blessing,</HI> is a branch that Springs from the Hebrew root in <HI>KAL,</HI> which properly signifies to bow the Knee; which is that natural Ceremony which is used in the Worship of God, and is put for Praying to Him, <HI>Psa.</HI> 95. 6. by which the Saints obtain blessings. By this <HI>Abraham</HI> Saved <HI>Let</HI> from those scorching flames that devoured the Inhabitants of the Plain.</P>
<P>Thus were <HI>Josiah</HI> and <HI>Nehemiah</HI> Blessings, who purged the House of God, and took care that the Sabbaths were Sanctifyed, and not pro∣phaned. Such as God, in his Wise Providence, doth advance to places of Authority, they become Blessings when they make it their principal care to promote and Set Up the Worship of God in their Dominions. Now the Power of Magistrates, relating to the Worship of God, is of an External nature; which lyes in taking care that duely Qualifyed Per∣sons be sent forth, and authorized to Preach the Word, and Administer the Seals of the Covenant; that they be able to Feed the People of God with Knowledge and Understanding. In order thereunto they are to Endeavour that <HI>Schools</HI> and <HI>Colleges</HI> be Erected, whereby Persons may be furnished with Learning, and so become <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, able to Teach: That People attend upon the Publick Worship of God: And Suitable Provision be made for the faithful Dispensers of the Gospel, whereby they may be Encouraged in the right discharge of the Work incumbent on them. We shall find in the Sacred History many Instances of Religious Kings and Rulers, who thus did, and were thereby great Blessings to their People.

Blessings to the Places where they live. This hath been the Happiness of <HI>New-England</HI> from the beginning.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Such as are Just and Righteous in all their Wayes and Actings.</HI> Thus was <HI>Abraham,</HI> who is styled the <HI>Righteous Man,</HI> as some understand that in <HI>Isa.</HI> 41. 2. Who was Righteous, not only by the imputation of the Righteousness of Christ, <HI>Gen.</HI> 15. 6. but by Inhaesion; which he mani∣fested in his Commerce with the Children of <HI>Heth, Gen.</HI> 23. 10. Righ∣teousness should be to all men, especially to Magistrates, the <HI>girdle of their loins, Isa.</HI> 11. 5. Thus it was with <HI>Job, Chap.</HI> 31. 38, 39. Such should be able to make such a Challenge as <HI>Samuel</HI> did; <HI>Whose Ox have I taken?</HI> 1 Sam. 12. 3, 4. And to avouch with <HI>Paul,</HI> that <HI>they have corrupted, wronged and defrauded no man,</HI> 2 Cor. 7. 2. When Rulers are careful to distribute Justice without Partiality; abhorring Bribes, which do <HI>blind the eyes of the Wise,</HI> and <HI>pervert the Judgment of the Righteous,</HI> as it is ex∣pressed in <HI>Exod.</HI> 23. 8. <HI>Deut.</HI> 16. 19. And having to do with Equals, in making Bargains and Contracts, which is called Cummutative Justice, they endeavour to keep a good Conscience, willing in all things to Live Honestly; Such are Blessings, as <HI>Nehemiah</HI> was, who bore a severe Testimony against the Oppression of the <HI>Jews, Chap.</HI> 5. They who constantly wear the Breast-plate of Righteousness; they honour the Christian Religion. This is a necessary requisite in a Magistrate, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 23. 3. <HI>He that Ruleth over men must be just, Ruling in the fear of God.</HI> It is not enough that Magistrates see to the Observation of the first Table; that Religion flourishes; but also, that the Second-Table Du∣ties be performed; that Righteousness be exalted, and have an unin∣terrupted passage; which is the most compendious way to draw down Heavens Blessings upon a People.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Such as give all diligence to perform their Relative Duties; and do not willingly step out of their Places, or Omit what is required of them.</HI> Thus <HI>Abraham</HI> was a faithful Ruler over his numerous Family, instructing them in what did appertain to the honour of God, and their best good. This is testifyed of him by God himself: <HI>Gen.</HI> 8. 19. <HI>I know that he will command his Children, and his Houshold after him, that they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment, that the Lord may bring upon</HI> Abraham <HI>that which he hath spoken of him.</HI> Thus was <HI>Joseph,</HI> his great-grand-Son, who, as a <HI>Son,</HI> was a blessing to his Father: as a <HI>Servant,</HI> he was a blessing to <HI>Potiphar</HI> his Master, <HI>Gen.</HI> 39. 5, 6. <HI>God blessed the Egyptians house for Joseph'</HI>s <HI>sake;</HI> As a <HI>Prisoner,</HI> he was a blessing to the Jaylor, <HI>Gen.</HI> 39. <HI>ult.</HI> And after his advancement by <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> as his <HI>Viceroy,</HI> he was a wonderful blessing to all the Kingdom of <HI>Egypt;</HI> as he was a <HI>Father</HI> to
<PB N="11" REF="001205_0012_0FB133D61C632E70"/>
<HI>Pharaoh,</HI> in seeking his honour, and maintaining his right: So he was a <HI>Father</HI> to the distressed <HI>Egyptians,</HI> and his own Relations.</P>
<P>GOD, in his All-Wise Providence, doth fix all Persons in this or that Relation; and of his condescending Grace, hath given an express ac∣count of his Will, how all should act therein. Now while Persons, whether Superiours or Inferiours, do act in their Places with Faithfulness, filling them up with Duty, they are blessings: and indeed this is needful to evince the truth and reality of their <HI>Piety</HI> towards God, and <HI>Love</HI> towards men. If we be not <HI>Relatively</HI> good, we have reason to question whether we be <HI>Really</HI> good. The World would be a quier Habitation, did all mind their own proper Du∣ties, and keep within the bounds and limits of their Places and Callings. There are none so Great Blessings in their Places as Magistrates and Ministers, who are careful and conscientious in the due discharge of their Duties. It is to be noted, that the neglect of Duty in one Re∣late, will not give a discharge to the Correlate, to omit the doing of his Duty; as it is evident in that of a Master and Servant: Tho' the Servant hath a cruel and crabbed Master; yet he ought to attend the performance of his own proper Duty, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 18. <HI>Servants be Sub∣ject to your Masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward,</HI> &amp;c. Hereby the sincerity and strength of Grace will be made manifest. Should Magistrates be somewhat defective in their places; yet that will not countenance Subjects to neglect their Duties.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Such as are of a Quiet and Peaceable Spirit, who labour to keep Amity and Unity in Societies.</HI> Such an one was <HI>Abraham,</HI> who shew'd it in his fair &amp; amicable proposals that he made to <HI>Lot</HI> his Nephew; who tho' he was his Superiour, yet was willing for peace sake, to recede from his own right, <HI>Gen.</HI> 13. 8. Such as have a tender regard to the peace and unity of a Society, and abhor to do any thing that may hazard it; they are Blessings where they live: as such are blessed in the account of our Saviour, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5. 9. <HI>Blessed are the Peace-makers;</HI> so they are undoubt∣edly Blessings: These do prevent a world of evil, and make way for much good. Contention is a great and voluminous Evil, exceeding baneful and destructive to the spiritual and temporal weal of Persons and Societies: Such therefore as prevent, and extinguish it when be∣gun, they are happy ones; who are like unto the Blessed GOD, who is the Author and Lover of Peace. Such may be said to be good, and do good. <HI>When our Officers are peace, and our Exactors righteousness,</HI> as it is Prophesied that there shall be such in Gospel days, <HI>Isa.</HI> 60. 17. When they are <HI>healers of breaches, and restorers of paths to dwell in;</HI> then such are Eminent Blessings.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="12" REF="001205_0013_0FB133D7A136AF80"/>
5. <HI>Such as are of a Publick frame of Spirit, who are studiously careful to do what lies within the compass of their power, for the furtherance of the good of Others.</HI> Thus was <HI>Abraham,</HI> who with importunity did intercede for the <HI>Sodomites;</HI> who also did expose himself and his many Servants to danger, that he might rescue <HI>Lot</HI> out of the hands of his Enemies. Such as are ready to sacrifice their Estates, and lay themselves open to great difficulties and dangers for the promotion of the good of others; they deserve to be owned as great Blessings. Such an one was <HI>Nehe∣miah,</HI> who denied himself, laid aside his ease, turn'd his back upon the pleasures of the <HI>Persian</HI> Court, &amp; was willing to engage with manifold difficulties, in travelling from <HI>Shushan</HI> to <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> which was Nine hundred miles. All this he did to advance the good of his Afflicted Brethren in <HI>Judea. Moses</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> shewed themselves to be endued with a publick frame of Spirit in those hyperbolical imprecations of theirs upon themselves, <HI>Exod.</HI> 32. 32. <HI>Forgive their sin; if not, blot me out of thy Book:</HI> Rom. 9. 3. <HI>I could wish my self accursed from Christ, for my Brethren.</HI> It is usually said, <HI>No man is born for himself:</HI> God hath so ordered all Creatures, that they have a dependance each upon other, <HI>Hos.</HI> 2. 21. 22. The Sun and Fountains they constantly teach men a Lesson of Self-denial &amp; publick Spiritedness; the one is sending <HI>down</HI> its warm and fructifying beams; the other is sending <HI>up</HI> its sweet and refreshing streams. Surely such as Divine Providence hath fixed in publick Stations, they are to have hearts proportionated thereunto. Those Excellent Persons that were the first Beginners of these Plantati∣ons, were endued with largeness of heart to promote the Weal of this whole People: The <HI>College</HI> which hath been of abundant use to this whole Land, is a standing Monument of it. Had not the First Plan∣ters been men of a Noble and generous Spirit, seeking the ad∣vancement of the Kingdom of Christ, and the good of the whole; we had never arrived to that growth and maturity that we are at this time. It will be the honour of such that succeed them in Dignities and Authority, to tread in their footsteps; whereby they will become great Blessings.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> The other Query is, <HI>Why those that are signally blessed, are to be Blessings?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. Because this is to answer the end and design of God in the bestowal of his Blessings: which is, that men may be put into a better capacity of doing good, than others are. The more good God bestows
<PB N="13" REF="001205_0014_0FB133D988973BE8"/>
upon any, the more Service to his Name he looks for from such. As for those that are by God called into Places of Authority over others, from such he looks for great Diligence in order to the furtherance of the good of others; as it is expressed in <HI>Rom.</HI> 13. 4. <HI>He is the Minister of God for good.</HI> People are not made for <HI>Rulers,</HI> but <HI>Rulers</HI> are set up for the sake and good of <HI>People.</HI> Whether in case of mans perseve∣rance in that state of integrity in which he was first made, there had been need of Magistrates to Govern men, is not so easily determined; tho' Order then as prescribed in the Fifth Command, would have been observed. But now there is an apparent necessity of Magistrates, partly to restrain men from those exorbitant motions that their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usts would unavoidably instigate them unto: and partly to provoke them to the doing those duties, that the Law of God, and light of nature dictate ought to be done. So that the End of God in furnishing per∣sons with intellectual abilities, and cloathing them with Authority, whereby they are called to the exercise of them; is to promote the weal and benefit of others. This is expressed by the Apostle, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 1, 2. where people are required to pray for Magistrates, Supream and Subordinate, that their Councels and Purposes may be so disposed by God, that under them we may live a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty; whereby it is plainly intimated, that the advancement of persons into Places of Authority, is intended by God for the spiritual and temporal weal of People and Societies. And there∣fore for such as are set over others, to use their power for the hurt and oppression of such as are under them, is a plain perverting of the end of God in the bestowal of those Blessings upon them. Hence for the preventing of this, God hath given Rules in his Word to people that have liberty of Chusing their Magistrates, to direct them in Elect∣ing such as are rightly qualifyed, who will study to promote their good, and will abhor to do any thing that is inconsistent with their weal.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Because this doth directly tend to the Glorifying of God.</HI> When per∣sons that stand higher than others, are careful to make a right use of those advantages that God puts into their hands, they become very serviceable to the Name and Honour of God: Those by their well-ordered Conversation do greatly encourage others to an imi∣tation of them: For the Examples of such are very influential upon others. Such will practically rebuke others that are scandalous in their actions; and they will be afraid to do those things that are op∣posite to the Laws of God, and just Laws of men; as the Apostle in∣timates,
<PB N="14" REF="001205_0015_0FB133DB30898D68"/>
<HI>Rom.</HI> 13. 3. <HI>Rulers are a Terror to evil works.</HI> But then when God in great anger doth suffer Evil Persons to bear Rule; there follows upon it an overflow of Wickedness, <HI>Psal.</HI> 12. <HI>ult. The Wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.</HI> As it is most evident in the History of the Kings of <HI>Israel</HI> and <HI>Judah:</HI> Then the Name and Honour of God is laid in the Dust, his Ordinances spurned at, and the Faithful Dispensers thereof contumeliously treated: which made way for the utter overthrow and captivity of the <HI>Jews</HI> by the <HI>Babylonians,</HI> as it is expressed, in 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 36. 15, 16.</P>
<P>This Truth Treated of presents before us,</P>
<P>I. Matter of <HI>Sorrow</HI> and <HI>Heart-grief,</HI> in that there be so many found in the midst of us, that are not Blessings in their Places: Who tho' they be not cloathed with Authority, either Political, or Ecclesiastical, yet being Endowed with intellectual abilities and many outward Bles∣sings, do greatly abuse them, whereby they become Curses &amp; Plagues to the Places where they Live! Are there not with us Contentious Persons? Who like the <HI>Salamander,</HI> Love to Live in the Fire and Flames of Contention: Who cast Fire-brands into Families, and Soci∣eties; and improve their wit and interest to foment &amp; continue them; who push men on to Law Suits, by means of whose evil counsels not a few have been undone: By means of such litigious persons, who are fill'd with pride and prejudice, whole Societies are sometimes put in∣to a flaming posture; such are an abomination unto God, <HI>Prov.</HI> 6. 16, 19. Among such as are hateful to God, are such as Sow strife among Brethren: Such must needs be grievous burdens unto men, when they are so loathsome unto God. With us are such as are very Unjust, who boggle at no Unrighteousness, so as they can get out of the reach of mans Law: by means of such we are under an ill character abroad in the World. Such wickedness of this kind is hardly found in places that want the light that hath so plentifully shin'd upon us. This Sin of Unrighteousness, where it hath abounded, it hath made very fear∣ful desolating Judgments upon Gods visible People. In the several Indictments that are drawn by Gods Prophets against the <HI>Israelites</HI> and <HI>Jews:</HI> We shall find that this Sin of Unrighteousness was a principal Article. Tho' God doth usually bear witness in his Providence against men for their injurious and cheating practices, by blasting those Estates, that by fraud, extortion and oppression have been rak'd together, <HI>Jer.</HI> 17. 11. 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 4. 6. Yet such is mens great love to the
<PB N="15" REF="001205_0016_0FB133DDE21DD360"/>
<HI>World,</HI> and little fear of God, that they will deal Unrighteously. With us are such as commit Lewdness, and are resigning up themselves to their Sensual Lusts; who spend much of their precious <HI>Time;</HI> and not a little of their <HI>Estates,</HI> in Publick Houses; transforming themselves in∣to beasts: Who <HI>Live in Chambering and Wantonness, in Rioting and Drunk∣enness;</HI> who act as tho' they were sent into the World for no other end, than to gratify their brutish Lusts. It is pity that any Heathenish Custom should be imitated by the People of God, that directly tends to the furtherance of Intemperance. With us are those that profane Gods Holy Sabbaths. Tho' these and other Scandalous Evils have been born Witness against from the <HI>British</HI> Throne once and again; yet how do they prevail, and threaten the overthrow of Religion! Some may wonder that so many in this Land of Light, and means of Grace, should arrive to such an height of Wickedness. This certainly proceeds either from the nature of some of these Sins, which naturally tend to beget a Stupefaction of the Mind and Conscience, <HI>Hos.</HI> 4. 11. <HI>Whoredom, and Wine, and new Wine take away the heart:</HI> Or from Gods Righteous Judgment in giving men up to their own hearts Lusts, <HI>Psal.</HI> 81. 11, 12. <HI>Israel would have none of me, so I gave them up to their own hearts Lusts.</HI> And we know that the richest Soil produceth the rankest Weeds. This Land was at first Sown with excellent Seed, they were a chosen Generation, a peculiar People zealous of good Works: God planted here a Noble Vine; but how are we turned into the degenerate Plant of a strange Vine? How many are there among us that may justly be accounted Burdens and <HI>Plague</HI> Sores? Surely the reiterated Judgments of God upon us do give in full Evidence to this sad Truth: These Sin∣ners in Scripture bear the ignominious name of <HI>Fools,</HI> and <HI>Mad-men;</HI> who are not only mischievous and hurtful to themselves, but also to all that are round about them.</P>
<P>II. This Truth presents us with matter of <HI>Joy</HI> and <HI>Comfort,</HI> in that there are yet with us that are truly and properly Blessings in their se∣veral Places and Capacities: For whose Sake we may hope that after the Righteous God hath in Mercy chastened us, for our revoltings from, and decayes of Love to Himself, and his Ordinances; and thereby brought us to a true sense of our Sins, and thereby wrought in us a sin∣cere purpose to amend our Evils: He will Save us, and make us a Praise and Glory. With us are many Pious Ones, who are glorious within; being adorned with the Graces of Gods Holy Spirit, who are endea∣vouring
<PB N="16" REF="001205_0017_0FB133DFC9FE9FD0"/>
to Walk with, &amp; act for God, in their respective Capacities; Striv∣ing in all things to please their Heavenly Father, and to Walk Worthy of him, who hath Called them to his Kingdom &amp; Glory. I believe there are as many real Saints in this Land, as in any Land or Nation in the World, for the quantity of People. And that which is to be minded, is, That our Magistrates and Ministers are Pious &amp; Religious, who are Seekers of God, and do sedulously set themselves to promote the Spiritual, as well as the Temporal Weal of Gods People in this Wilderness. We have yet many Praying <HI>Abrahams, Nehemiahs, Elijahs</HI> and <HI>Jeremiahs,</HI> that are pleading with God, and Crying with Tears, saying to God, O spare thy People, and give not thy Heritage to become a prey to the Heathens! We read of Gods readiness to spare <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> if there were but ten Righteous Persons among them: and are there not among us more than an hundred times Ten? Yea, we find God ready to Par∣don his People, if they could but find a <HI>Man, Jer.</HI> 5. 1. That is, a faithful and zealous <HI>Magistrate:</HI> and are there not many such with us? Who desire to <HI>do Justly, shew Mercy, and walk humbly with their God:</HI> Who tho' they may be defective (and who is not?) yet are endeavouring to Rule and Direct this People, over whom they are Set, according to the Integrity of their hearts, and Skilfulness of their hands. Yea, are there not several Well-qualifyed Persons with us, who are prepared in a good measure to act in the Place of Magistracy, and Ministry? If we take measure by Gods acting with his own People of old: We may foster and maintain Hopes within us, that God will not as yet reject us, nor Write a <HI>Loammi</HI> upon us. Tho' it is true that in Gospel times God may justly make quicker Work now with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> visible People, by bring∣ing sore and ruinating Judgments upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>m, than he did upon his People heretofore; in regard of the greater plenty of Light, that hath shined upon, and Love that hath been shown to us. I would not venture to say any thing of this nature, to lull any asleep in a Secure and Sinful State. Let us therefore know, We that have received more Mercies, and have enjoyed greater Privileges than others; if we re∣main in an Unbelieving and Impenitent State; We shall be liable to bear and suffer greater measures of Woe &amp; Wrath, than others, <HI>Amos</HI> 3. 2. <HI>You only have I known of all the Families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.</HI> Our greater exaltation to <HI>Heaven</HI> will make way for our great depression in <HI>Hell, Mat.</HI> 11. 23. All such will find that their Church-Privileges and formal Performances of Duties, will be but as a Paper-Wall against a consuming Fire: as the <HI>Jews,</HI> in <HI>Jeremiahs</HI> time, found it by sad and woful experience.</P>

<HI>To such as are our Political Fathers:</HI></P>
<P>Let me with much Respect and deep Humility address your Excel∣lency: Much Honoured SIR, The Unerring Hand of Divine Pro∣vidence hath Set you on High, making you the Head &amp; Chief Ruler, under our Gracious Sovereign, of the People of this Province; Placing you in the Seat of Justice and Chair of Honour: whereby you are in a Capacity of being a Rich Blessing to this People of God. 'Tis to be hoped that the Sense of Gods great goodness in your Exaltation to so High a pitch of Honour and Authority; together with the Conside∣ration of His signal Mercy in effecting Salvation from great and immi∣nent Dangers heretofore; and especially of Late; (upon the account of which we have abundant reason to give Thanks to God) will in∣fluence your Heart into a Willingness to improve your admirable Accomplishments for the furtherance of the Welfare and Safety of this People, over whom you are made Chief Ruler; by Encouraging such as are Religious; and discouraging such as are Profane and Vitious; Rewarding the One, and Punishing the Other. Doubtless, when <HI>Moses</HI> that Renowned Ruler of <HI>Israel</HI> had made a Serious reflection upon the peculiar Mercy of God in preserving his Life, that was in eminent danger by means of that cruel Edict of <HI>Pharaoh;</HI> as also Gods remem∣bring him when Swimming on the River in a little Canoo made of Bulrushes; putting him into a near Relation to the King of <HI>Egypts</HI> Daughter, whereby he had a liberal Education in the Court of <HI>Pharaoh▪</HI> all this wrought his heart into a forwardness to lay out himself for the Honour of God, and the good of his own afflicted People. Honoured SIR, You have had very fair Copies heretofore in those that have been Governours of this People, presented before you (from One of which, who was Eminent for Parts and Piety you have immediately descend∣ed) after which, if by the assistance of Gods Spirit, you endeavour to Write; You will be, as they were, a signal Blessing to this People; by which you will confute the Jealousies and Censures of some; and answer the Hopes and Expectations of others: and so a Blessing will come down upon you, and yours.</P>
<P>As for those Honoured Persons that are concerned in the Govern∣ment of the People in this Province; <HI>viz.</HI> The Honoured Deputy Governour, and the Counsellors, that may be Chosen this Day▪ Honoured SIRS, You are called to Sit with his Excellency at the Helm, to guide and order the affairs of this Province, in a Stormy and Tempestuous time: therefore you have need of much Prudence and Patience, that you may act aright in order to the promotion of the
<PB N="18" REF="001205_0019_0FB133E224BF9BA8"/>
Welfare &amp; Safety of this People. That one Title, which is Superiour to all others; <HI>viz.</HI> that you are <HI>Gods, Psal.</HI> 82. 6. that intimates to you that you are to be Blessings. That Title <HI>Elohim</HI> is the first of those <HI>Hebrew</HI> Names, that are given to GOD, which we find in the first line of the Bible: Who having by His infinite perfections Erected this Stately Edifice of the World, and furnished every Room thereof with variety of Creatures, hath an absolute &amp; Underived Authority to Rule and Govern all Things. This Name and honourable Title He hath fixed upon you whereby He tells you that your Power is derived from Him, and that as He hath set you above many; so you are to imitate Him in Goodness and Usefulness; that by the sweet and benign In∣fluences of your Authority you become Instruments in furthering the Good and Benefit of all such as are under you, by a due and right Re∣gulation of the Affairs of this People of God, and that you in an espe∣cial manner shew it in advancing Religion and Godliness, taking care that the House of God be not forsaken, and his holy Sabbaths be not prophaned. About those, <HI>Nehemiah</HI> that Pious Ruler acted with an holy Zeal, as we may see in that Book which bears his Name.</P>
<P>It concerns those worthy Gentlemen, the Representatives of this Province, to be very carefull in putting in their Suffrages for Council∣lors, that they be Persons duly Qualified, who may give grounded Hopes that they will in all things act so, as that they may be Blessings to this People of GOD: and that they readily concur in making such Acts and Laws, as apparently tend to the Furtherance of Piety, and Equity. If it might not be accounted too much boldness, I would pro∣pose One thing to such as have the power of Legislation: Whether it be not needful that there be something Enacted to quicken under Of∣ficers, as <HI>Tything-men, Constables, and Grand-Iurors,</HI> to a more Vigorous accomplishment of those Promisory Oaths that Annu∣ally they take, in the Suppressing of Intemperance and Disorders, that seem to be growing among us. It is to be feared, That several of those Officers do forget their Oaths, thinking that unless Complaints drop into their Ears, they are no way concern'd to act in their Places.</P>
<P>Let me say a few words to the <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Gospel, not for their Information, but for their Excitation to the doing of those things that they fully know.</P>
<P><HI>Reverend Sirs,</HI> The many Honourable Titles that by the Holy Ghost in the Scriptures are fixed upon <HI>Ministers;</HI> as <HI>Lights of the World, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>-workers with Christ, Messengers of the Lord of Hosts,</HI> and <HI>Ambassadors of
<PB N="19" REF="001205_0020_0FB133E3C2649068"/>
Christ:</HI> These with many others do point out our Duty, that we should so act in our Places▪ that we may be Blessings, in being Serviceable to all that we stand related to; by a diligent improvement of all our A∣bilities for the advancement of the Spiritual and Eternal Weal of the Souls of men. It is most certain, that the Ministry is a Signal Blessing, and one of those Royal Gifts which our Exalted Lord Jesus gave to his Church, when he Rode in Triumph into Heaven; as is evident by what we find in <HI>Eph.</HI> 4. 10, 11. <HI>Isa.</HI> 30. 20, 21. Hereupon we are bound to give a plain and faithful Declaration of the whole Counsel of God, so far as we are able: That solemn charge which is usually given to Ministers at their Installment into this Sacred Office of the Ministry, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 1, 2. ought frequently to be minded by us. And it should be our great care to maintain the honour of Gospel Truths which we publish; by an unstained and unspotted Conversation. We are not only <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> rightly to divide the Word of God, and as faithful Stew∣ards, to give to every one their portion: But withal, we are <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> to walk aright, transcribing the Laws of the Gospel in our lives and actions. Such as did bear the Vessels of the Sanctuary, were to be ho∣ly in a peculiar manner; the Priests were to be void of bodily defects, they were to have their <HI>Urim</HI> &amp; <HI>Thummim;</HI> as also a Bell and Pome∣granate: the meaning of which we are not ignorant of. If our <HI>Acti∣ons</HI> do not correspond with our <HI>Instructions</HI> and <HI>Reprehensions;</HI> they will be in a great measure insignificant. We shall pull down with one hand, what we build up with the other. We are by the <HI>Purity</HI> of our Doctrine, and <HI>Piety</HI> of our lives, to endeavour to win men to Christ, and to bring them out of love with their evil wayes; in a liking of the good Wayes of God, and so we shall save our selves, and those that hear us. In a word, the Honour of the blessed God, the Welfare of mens Souls, and our own Peace in a Dying Hour, are arguments very cogent to provoke as all to a faithful discharge of the Duties of our Places. One thing I would propose, <HI>viz.</HI> That we all endeavour af∣ter Unity in our <HI>Affections,</HI> and so far as we can, in our <HI>Apprehensions.</HI> It is a good rule delivered by some: <HI>In necessariis Unitas, in non necessariis Libertas, in utrisque Charitas.</HI> We are all well agreed as to Fundamentals of Doctrine and Order; we should therefore exercise Charity towards such as may differ from us in matters that are not so plainly revealed in the Word about Church-Discipline, and may be lookt upon as mat∣ters of a prudential nature; forbearing to brand such as differ from us, and do not so fully concur with such things as have been practised, with the ill Titles of Apostates, and Subverters of the Order of the Gospel.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="001205_0021_0FB133E518C79CD8"/>
I shall conclude with a few words to all: Let us all act so as we may be in our respective places Blessings; In order thereunto,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Let us become the true and sincere Servants of God, resolving to Obey, and be Subject to him in all things.</HI> It is our honour, and it will be our com∣fort, to be able to say with <HI>Paul,</HI> that we are the Servants of God, stri∣ving in all things to glorifie his name, <HI>Act.</HI> 27. 23. Let our Wills be resolved into Gods Will; this will constitute us good m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, and render us Blessings: according to the saying of an Heathen, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, a Good man is a common good; which agrees with what <HI>Solo∣mon</HI> says, <HI>Prov.</HI> 29. 8. <HI>Wise men turn away wrath.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Let us be Thankful for the many Privileges and peculiar Mercies that we are at present possessed with.</HI> Tho' it may not be so well with us as it hath been; yet be sure it is far better with us than it is with many others. That we have our Titles to our Houses and Lands confirm∣ed to us, so as that we need not fear a Writ of Ejectment to be Served upon us, for want of a Patent: That we have a Government set over us, is a mercy to be minded: <HI>Tyranny</HI> is accounted more eligible than <HI>Anarchy.</HI> Without Government and Magistracy the World would be as one styles it, <HI>Magnum Latrocinium, q. d.</HI> a great Den of Thieves and Robbers: <HI>Might would bear down Right.</HI> Men, like Dogs, would try their titles with their teeth; and all difference between <HI>Meum</HI> and <HI>Tuum</HI> would be abolished. But that which challengeth our thankfulness is, that we are Governed by Religious Magistrates, who reckon it to be their Duty to be at all times, <HI>Utriusque tabulae Custodes,</HI> by means of which the wayes to our Solemn Assemblies do not mourn; and so we are a blessed People, in that we hear and know the joyful Sound, and may with joy draw Water out of the Wells of Salvation, walking in the light of Gods Countenance, and may expect also to have redress of wrongs and injuries done unto us. Unsensibleness of Gods Mercies, and our unthankfulness for them, is one of our provoking Evils; there∣fore that we may obtain Blessings from God, &amp; a removal of his Judg∣ments; let us, every one of us set the Crown of Praise upon Gods Head, and be inwardly affected with his peculiar favours bestowed on us. Let us be Prayerful; all such have been Blessings in their places, as <HI>Moses, David</HI> were, who frequently with fervency were applying themselves by Prayer unto God for all manner of Mercies suitable and needful for themselves and others. The calamitous nature of the time doth require of us the performance of this Duty, <HI>Psal.</HI> 50. 15. We ne∣ver find a Saint of God in Affliction, but we find him upon his knees,
<PB N="21" REF="001205_0022_0FB133E692C1C5E8"/>
as is evident in <HI>Jacob, David,</HI> and others. Prayer rightly performed, hath a kind of Omnipotency in it; as <HI>Moses, Elijah</HI> and others their Prayers had. This is that Golden Key, which being oyled with Tears, and turn'd with the hand of Faith, will unlock the Cabinet of the Promises, and thereby many Blessings will be flowing in upon us: And in an especial manner, let us Pray for our Rulers, as it is plainly required without any exception or limitation: This Command was given when <HI>Nero</HI> that monster of men for wickedness, was Emperor, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 1, 2. Would we have our Magistrates to be Blessings: Let us strive with God in our Prayers for them. The hearts of Kings and Rulers are in the Hand of God, who can dispose all their purposes and councels, so as that they shall conduce to, and issue in the Good and Weal of his People. Did People turn their malicious <HI>Prating</HI> against Magistrates and Ministers, into ardent <HI>Praying</HI> for them, they would both honour themselves, and the Name of God, call'd upon them.</P>
<P>Let us stand clear from rash Judging and Censuring our Rulers. Certain it is, that People are not competent judges of the actions of Magistrates: it is a usual saying, that there are <HI>Arcana Imperii,</HI> Myste∣ries of State, to the bottom of which, People are not able to dive.</P>
<P>Let us not entertain groundless Jealousies of our Rulers. This hath put People sometimes into an unquiet, yea, into a rebellious Posture; and at no time they prevail so much as when distress and hardships have been predominant: as we find it in <HI>Isa.</HI> 8. 21. <HI>They shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry,</HI>—<HI>they shall fret themselves, and Curse their King, &amp; their God.</HI> We have instances of this in Scripture, as of <HI>Mo∣ses, Exod.</HI> 14. 11, 12. whom the <HI>Israelites</HI> were ready to Stone, as the <HI>Jewish</HI> Historian saith, but his <HI>Meckness</HI> overcame their <HI>Madness.</HI> And <HI>David</HI> was in great hazard of his Life when he came to <HI>Ziklag,</HI> 1 Sam. 30. 6. <HI>The People were greatly distressed, and they spake of Stoning of him.</HI> We should root out all hard thoughts of our Rulers; Endeavouring that our hearts be filled with Love to them: thereby we shall construe all their actions in the best sense; and so live a quiet and peaceable Life under them.</P>
<P>Let People account it their Duty to Contribute to the Comforta∣ble &amp; Honourable Support of their Rulers: This is expressly required, <HI>Rom.</HI> 13. 7. Our Saviour exemplifyed this Command in his own Practice: who wrought a Miracle that he might have Money to pay Tribute, <HI>Matth.</HI> 22. 21. which he did partly to prevent Offence, and partly to see an Example to all Christians in after Generations. The height and dignity of their Places calls for it, for God allows his Vicegerents, <HI>viz.</HI>

The Chief Magistrates to Live at an higher rate than others, that so they may maintain the Honour of their Places. Their Fare, their Rayment, their Buildings, are to transcend others. 'Tis to be hop'd that our Honoured Rulers have a Sense of the Low Estate of the Ge∣nerality of this People.</P>
<P>Let us fill up our Lives and Places with Duty: be like our Saviour, who went up and down doing Good. Let us put on bowels of Com∣passion, and be communicating to such as are in necessity, and strive to help Sinners out of their Sinful Wayes, hereby we shall be blessings.</P>
<P>To Conclude, Let us all endeavour to amend what is, and hath been amiss, unfeignedly returning unto God. As one Sinner destroys much good, <HI>Eccles.</HI> 9. <HI>ult.</HI> So many Repenting and Reforming Sinners may procure much good: whereby we shall be Blessings in our Pla∣ces. God hath signalized his Mercy, not only in making many Pro∣mises of much good to Penitents, but he hath also accomplished them unto such; as he did to the <HI>Israelites, Judg.</HI> 10. 15, 16. Let us say with the Church, <HI>Lam.</HI> 3. 4. <HI>Let us search and try our wayes, and turn unto the Lord;</HI> And with them, <HI>Hos.</HI> 6. 1, 2. <HI>Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he will heal us: he hath smitten, and he will bind us up. After two dayes will he revive us, in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.</HI> Thereupon we may expect that God will be with us, as he was with our Fathers; He will not leave or forsake us. And in these perilous and burdensome times, the Eternal God will be our Refuge, and underneath us will be his Everlasting Arms. <HI>Unto Him be Glory in the Church by CHRIST JESUS, through∣out all Ages, World without End.</HI></P>
