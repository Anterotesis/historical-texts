<HEAD>The Experiences of GOD's gracious Dealing with Mrs. Elizabeth White.</HEAD>
<P>FROM my Child-hood the LORD hath inclined my Heart to seek after the best Things, and my Father's chiefest Care was to bring me up in the N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ure and Admonition of the Lord: My Nature being some-what more Mild than the rest of my Sisters, I was ready to think my self some Body, and with the proud Pharisee, to thank God that I was not as others, not considering that I was but like a Wolf chained up, which keeps its Nature still, as I by the Goodness of God have seen, since the Lord was pleased to lay his Eye Salve upon me. I was a great lover of Histories, and o∣ther foolish Books, and did often spar'd my sleep∣ing Time in reading of them, and sometimes I should think I did not do well in so doing, but I was so bewitched by them, that I could not for∣bear; and hearing of a Friend of mine, which was esteemed a very holy Woman, that did delight in Histories, I then concluded it was no Sin, and gave my self wholly then to this kind of Folly, when
<PB N="4" REF="004841_0004_100DFFF8F48F71C0"/>
I had any spare Time, for two or three Years. I had sometimes slight Thoughts of Repentance, but was loath to set about it, and so I should put the Lord off from Time to Time with delays, thinking still I should find a fitter Time than the present. I remember about a Month before I was married, my Father would have me receive the Sacrament of the LORD's Supper, and I was very willing to it; until I considered what was requisite to be in those which did partake thereof, and then I began to doubt that I had not those Things which were requisite wrought in me, as Knowledge, Faith, Love, Repentance, &amp;c. And then this Scripture came into my Mind, <HI>He that doubteth is damned if he eat, for whatsoever is not of Faith is Sin:</HI> When I had considered those Things I was filled with Sorrow, and could not tell what to do, I was loath to disobey my Father, and more loath to eat and drink my own Damnation; in this Perplexity I set my self to seek the Lord for his Grace, being at that Time somewhat sensible of the want of it; when I had thus done, I began to be comforted, verily thinking, now I had repented, and could believe in Christ Jesus: And having some notional Knowledge of Things, I was indifferently well satisfied, thinking that when I was married, I should have more leisure to serve God; and then going to the Minister of the Parish, to be Examined before I was admitted, and finding my self able to Answer him, I thought all was well with me then, and so unworthy! went to the Lord's Table, not questioning but that I was in as good a Condition as any of the rest which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ceive. But blessed for ever be the Lord, which broke my false Confidence, and swept away my refuge of Lies, which I then trusted in, and shewed
<PB N="5" REF="004841_0005_100DFFFA803E06E8"/>
me my sad Condition I was in by Nature and Practice more clearly than ever before; and this was about a Quarter of a Year after I was married, in the Year, 1657. The Minister being upon this Subject, Prov. 1. 23. <HI>Turn ye at my Reproof, &amp;c.</HI> Being upon the Use of Trial, whether indeed we had turned to God or no? He bid us examine our selves by some Marks which he then gave, and it was at this Time that God did begin to manifest his Love to me, as I trust, in my effectual Vocation; here the Lord was pleased to open my Heart, as he did the Heart of <HI>Lydia;</HI> so that I at∣tended to the Things that were spoken, and I per∣ceived my Heart was not right in the Sight of God, and that my Hope was but like that of the Hypocrite which perisheth; when I came home I besought the Lord to turn me, if I were not yet turned to him, but yet I had not that thorow Sense of Sin, as I had afterwards: About three Weeks after, the Minister coming to our House, my Husband and I was speaking that we would desire him to pray with us in our Chamber, but that Time he could not stay, the next Day he came and asked for me, telling me that my Husband told him that I would speak with him. O how was I surprized! I could not tell what to say upon the sudden, I was so hurried in my Thoughts. O how loath was I to acquaint him with my sad State! I was ashamed to tell him that I was yet a Stranger to God and all Good∣ness, till it was forced from me, which when he heard he did not go about to Comfort me, but he asked me, if ever I was convinced before? And I told him, Yes; &amp; he repeated the first Verse of the 29th Chapter of the Proverbs. <HI>He that being often reproved, hardeneth his Neck, shall suddenly be
<PB N="6" REF="004841_0006_100DFFFCA603B080"/>
destroyed, and that without Remedy:</HI> When I heard this I was wonderfully troubled; then there came many Sins to my Remembrance, which I had taken no notice of before, counting them small Sins; now the Time which was t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en in reading Histories, I remembred with bitter Grief, and I thought that there was no Mercy for me, but he preswaded me there was Hope of Mercy for such as I, and that the Lord waited to be gracious to poor Sinners, and then I was a little satisfied for the present; but then I was troubled with Blasphemous Thoughts, which were very grievous to me: I thought I had a Heart worse than the Devil, and wondered that I was not consumed in some strange Manner. When I have seen a Spider, which of all Things is most loathsome to me, I have been ready to wish my self such a one, esteeming of it to be in a far happie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Condition than I was; I was afraid to be in the Dark, lest I should meet the Devil; I doubted whether I was Elected, I had read, that it was not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of GOD that sheweth Mercy: Then I thought if I were not Elected, is was to no Purpose to strive, for what GOD hath decreed must be, but yet I was unwilling to perish, I could not be so satisfied, although I had but little Hope to obtain Mercy, yet I could not but ask it: I was also very fervent in hearing the Word preach∣ed and read, not daring to let slip an Opportunity, but not without many Tears, lest it should increase my Condemnation; In this Condition I remained a great while, but not without some secret Supports from the LORD, sometimes by a Word cast in upon my Spirit, sometimes I was refreshed I could not tell how, but I should be
<PB N="7" REF="004841_0007_100DFFFED39EFAD0"/>
ready to think this was a Delusion: I remember the Scriptures were these, Isa. 51. 10. <HI>Who is among you that feareth the LORD, that obeys the Voice of his Servant, that walks in Darkness, and hath no Light? Let him trust in the Name of the Lord, and stay upon his God.</HI> John 15 16. <HI>Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth much Fruit, and that your Fruit should remain,</HI> &amp;c. Lamen. 3. 25. <HI>The Lord is good unto the Soul that waits for him, and to them that seek him: It is good that a Man should both hope, and quiet∣ly wait for the Salvation of the Lord</HI> &amp;c. These Words did support me very much, therefore, I writ them out and laid them in my Closet, that they might still be in my Eye, that I might when I looked upon them be incouraged to hope in, and wait upon the Lord; but these Comforts were but transient, but yet while they lasted they were very sweet Supports, but when gone I sell to doubting, thinking all was Delusions, and thus I dishonoured God by my Unbelief; I doubted much of my Sincerity, often saying, I was an Hy∣procrite, but if at any Time I was asked in what I was one, I could not tell; but had this Scripture very often in my Mind, <HI>There is a Way which seemeth right unto a Man, but the End thereof is Death:</HI> And so I thought I was but seemingly right, and therefore must needs perish: And in this Condition I continued a long Time, till I heard that a Hypocrite seldom or never doubted his Condition, and that is was a Sign of Sincerity, to desire a sincere Heart; and this I durst not deny, knowing that I did desire it rather than the whole World.</P>
<P>Thus being better satisfied, I resolved to set about my Duty, but all this while I did not set
<PB N="8" REF="004841_0008_100E000110C63850"/>
such a high Price upon the LORD JESUS as I should, but still I thought that I must do some∣thing to merit Salvation, not daring to venture my Soul with all its Concernments upon Christ, therefore I should tie my self to pray six times a Day, and then I should be satisfied, and think all was well with me then. But if I at any Time failed of my Number, then I was dissatisfied, and so in other Duties; so that my Comforts did not flow from the Blood and Righteousness of JESUS, but from my own Duties; but blessed be the LORD, who likewise shook this Foundation, even because he had a Favour to me: For being in Discourse with a Friend, he desired me to read <HI>Sheperd's sincere Convert;</HI> which I did; and here did I see as in a Glass my folly, for there were Signs given whereby I might try my self, whether I did rest in Duties. One I remember was this, if I never saw I rested in Duties, then it was a sure Sign that I did; another was this, if I prized the bare performance of Duties so, as to think when I prayed with some Life, that I had done very well; and again if I saw but little of my vile Heart by Duties, then it was a Sign I rested in them, and that I was yet in the Way to Hell, though in the cleanliest Way, and should certain∣ly perish if I rested here. Now this I plainly saw was my Condition, but how to get out of it I knew not, for now I was in a worse Condition that at the beginning, finding it abundantly more hard to deny righteous Self than sinful Self. I thought it wonderful Strange, that I must be saved by the Righteousness of another, if ever I were saved; O this my proud Heart was un∣willing to yield to, and yet I was very desirous of Salvation: But when the Lord had led me
<PB N="9" REF="004841_0009_100E00029AA818C0"/>
into my own Heart, and shewed me the Vileness of that more, and that if the Lord should leave me to myself, I should commit all kind of Sin, and that with greediness, such was the Vileness of my Na∣ture, and that if it were possible I should now live holily, yet I could not satisfy the Justice of God for what was past, therefore I resolved to cast my self upon Christ Jesus that sure Foundation, which GOD had laid and not Man, and if I perished, to perish here; but much Opposition did I meet with from Satan and my own Heart, before I could really do it. I could seal to the Truth of that Scripture, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1. 19. That GOD did put forth his mighty Power, when a Soul was made to be∣lieve; but yet I was not at quiet, but had many Fears and Doubts that all was false, because I had been so often deceived, and now I began to see mine own Vileness more then ever, and found mine Heart ran out to the LORD JESUS in Love, but doubted very much of his Love to me, yet sometimes I should have some Perswasions of my Interest in CHRIST, and that his Love was towards me; and whilst this Perswa∣sion lasted I should be very comfortable, and be ready to think, I should never be moved, as <HI>David</HI> did: But when GOD hid his Face, I was troubled and fell to doubting all again, nor having learned that Heavenly Skill of living by Faith, but yet I did not wholly cast off my Confidence, but had some Pin-hole of Hope in the worst Condition. I remember the Consideration of this Scripture, John 3. 8. <HI>He that is born of GOD doth not commit Sin,</HI> filled me with many Fears, know∣ing how apt I was to commit Sin, notwithstanding my striving against it: But a little while after I was satisfied, understanding the Place better, that
<PB N="10" REF="004841_0010_100DEED906CDBEB8"/>
it was not meant of Sins of Infirmity, but of making Sin one's Trade, &amp;c. And this I was confident I did not, but rather trembled at the Thoughts of it; but when this was over, Satan and my own unbelieving Heart would still be presenting some∣thing whereby to occasion Doubts, so that for the space of one Year and a Half, I had scarcely any settled Peace, now and then a good Word thrown in which would revive me for the present, but the Comfort would be soon gone; as Ezek. 30. 26.<HI>A new Heart will I give, and a new Spirit will I put in you, and I will take away the stony▪ Heart out of your Flesh, and I will give you a Heart of Flesh, and will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my Statutes,</HI> &amp;c This Promise I did often plead with God very sensibly, and with much Confidence. Another was, John 11 25. <HI>I am the Resurrection and the Life, he that believeth on me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: And whoso∣ever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.</HI> This I remember was very sweet to me; once when I was in great Fear least my Heart should grow dead, and when I was with Child, I was much de∣jected, having a Sense of my approaching Danger, and wanting an Assurance of my everlasting Hap∣piness; but whilst I was considering of these Things, I had this Scripture set home with a∣bundance of Sweetness, Psal. 53. 15. <HI>Call upon me in the Day of Trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me:</HI> And in the Time of Extremity this Word was set home upon my Heart again, and my good GOD made me to Experience the Truth of it in a wonderful Manner, for I had speedy Deliverance beyond my Expectation, which filled my Heart and Mouth with Praises to the LORD; about three Days after a Friend coming
<PB N="11" REF="004841_0011_100E0006EEA50E28"/>
to visit me, I related to her how good the LORD had been unto me, and how sweetly my Heart was established, but no sooner was my Friend gone, but I was tempted to think my Faith was false, but I laboured what I could to encourage my self in the LORD my GOD.</P>
<P>But as I lay in my Bed, I thought I saw three Men before me, and it was presently sug∣gested to me that these were the three Persons in the Trinity; O then I was very much troubled, but I knew I was under a Temptation, and therefore cryed to the LORD for Help, but was not presently delivered from it; but I had this Scripture brought to my Mind, <HI>No Man shall see my Face and live,</HI> Exod. 33. 20. But not being yet freed, I began to consider what I had heard and read as Means to help against such Temptations, at last I remembred, that Mr. <HI>Bolton</HI> in his Book of Instructions for right comforting of afflicted Consciences, gave this Direction, after the Party had prayed for Help against the Tempter, and done what they could in repelling him by the Word of GOD, that if they were yet followed by Satan, that then they should set about some honest Imployment; but now I was in Bed, and knew not what to set about for the present, at last I re∣solved to try to Suckle my Child, which I did, and then lay down again, and found that I was pretty well freed from that Temptation, and finding my self much distempered in my Head, I desired the Lord to give me Rest, and went about to compose my self to Sleep; but as I lay, I thought Satan stood before me, asking where I could find a Promise for Sleep, at pre∣sent I could not think of any, but after some study this was brought into my Mind, <HI>The Lord will
<PB N="12" REF="004841_0012_100E00094FD77B20"/>
give his Beloved Sleep:</HI> This Word comforted me, but yet I could not all that Night get any Sleep, but still thought I saw Satan laughing at me, be∣cause I had no Sleep, and yet trusted in his Word; thus all the Night I continued weak in Body, and comfortless in Mind, so that in the Morning I expected nothing but Death, then be∣ginning to think more seriously of my Change, Satan as I then thought, asked me where was my Assurance of my everlasting Happiness? At this I was very much troubled, knowing I had not full Assurance, but yet some good Hope through the Goodness of GOD I had, therefore my Heart made Answer, it is true, I have no Assurance, but I have cast my self wholly upon the Lord Christ, and in him only is my Hope, and here will I Rest, and if I perish, I perish, but sure I am such shall not perish, for Christ hath promised them eternal Lief. Thus being assisted by the Lord, I vanquished Satan for that Time: And being thus at Peace, I quickly fell asleep, and dreamed there was a Ladder set upon the Earth, whose top reached to Heaven, and I thought I was to go up, I was pulled do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n again, which caused me to shed abundance of Tears, fearing that I should never get up, and I tho't something from above drew me by the Arms, but I could not see what, but at last I thought I was in Heaven, where all Tears were wiped from mine Eyes, and I was filled with Rejoycing, but when I had been there a little while, I thought I was to go back again to the Earth, and this very much troubled me: But then I thought I heard a Voice saying, it would be but for a little while, and that
<PB N="13" REF="004841_0013_100E000AD8E8C908"/>
I should die in Child-bed,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Which accordingly came to pass about twelve Years after her Marriage.</NOTE> and that the Night before I died, I should have full Assurance; this very much rejoyced me, (and I was very desirous to know of what Child I should die) but that was denied me upon this Account, because I should be always prepared, but when I did awake I was filled with inexpressible joy, earnestly longing to be Dissolved, and to be with Christ, which was best of all, and yet willing, if the Lord pleased to suffer any Thing which might be inflicted on me. Then I remembred how Satan when I was about to turn to GOD, would present the Sufferings of GOD's People to me, thinking by that Means to turn me back again, and how I should be dis∣couraged by them, but being filled with the Joys of God's Spirit, I thought I could suffer any Thing, not wondering, as I had done, how the Saints of old could bear up so bravely under their Sufferings. But after I began to amend, my Joys were not so full, as they had been, but I had a more settled Peace than formerly I had, blessed be the Lord; I had many various Changes in my spiritual State, but once having a great Sense of a hard Heart, and being desirous to have it modified, I was tempted to do some great Evil, as the only Means to break it; and that it might be the readier entertain'd, Satan put it into my Heart, to consider the Condition of <HI>Nathaniel Butler,</HI> whose Heart was unbroken till the Com∣mission of that horrid Sin of Murder, and then this great Evil brought him to a Sight and Sense of all Sin. This Temptation was very strong
<PB N="14" REF="004841_0014_100E000D01997C20"/>
upon me, but yet stronger was he that was with me, than he that was against me: for at that very Instant did the Lord cast into my Heart that happy Word, Rom. 8.3 <HI>Let us do Evil, that Good may come, whose Damnation is just</HI> This Word proved a happy Means to repel the Temptation; but yet this Mercy I had forgot, till the Lord revived it upon my Heart, almost two Years after as I was reading the Chapter.</P>
<P>And since my Child was weaned, I was in such a State of Deadness and Darkness, that I thought if I was ever raised out of it, I should never question my Condition again; I was tempted to think that the Scripture was not the Word of GOD? I had let out my Affection in a wonderful Measure to my Child, and yet my Lord forsook me not, but dispelled my Darkness, and filled me with Rejoycing; O what shall I render to Him? After this I grew into another Damp and was raised again, and I trust the Lord will keep me, notwithstanding all the mist which shall be raised in my Heart by Sin and Satan, even by his Power through Faith unto Salvation. These Scriptures revived me at several Times, when I was in Heaviness for want of the Presence of God at the Ordinance of the LORD's Supper, Prov 8.34 <HI>Blessed are they that watch daily at my Gates, waiting at the Posts of my Doors</HI> Math. 20.15. <HI>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with my own</HI> This checked me and made me wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing to wait at that Time; But this is my Comfort, God is Unchangeable, who I trust will carry me through all the Difficulties I shall meet with here below, and I trust will ere long bring me to the Enjoyment of himself, where I shall be past Sinning and Sorrowing. And as a further
<PB N="15" REF="004841_0015_100E000F2635B148"/>
Testimony of my Interest in Christ, by the Effects of my Faith, I have these Evidences.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> My Love to GOD, which is greater then to any Thing in the World besides, and my GOD hath left it upon Record, <HI>that he Loves them that Love him,</HI> Prov. 8.17. I know my Love is not so great as it should be; but I am sure my greatest Grief is that I can Love him no better, and in this Case GOD will accept the Will for the Deed.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I know my Love is sincere by this, because I love the Children of GOD, for as it is, 1 John 5. 1 <HI>Every one that loveth him that begat, loveth him also that is begotten of him;</HI> And by this I know that I love the Children of GOD, because I love GOD; so that this is another Evidence, that I am passed from Death to Life, even be∣cause I love the Brethren. 1 <HI> John 3. 14;</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,,</HI> I can appeal to the LORD, who is the searcher of Hearts, that the Breathings of my Soul are chiefly after Holiness, that I might be more like unto the LORD JESUS; my Desire is to serve GOD in all Things, and to have a real and hearty respect unto all GOD'S Commandments, and I de∣sire (if it were possible.) that I might never Sin more, but rather that I might behave my self in all Holy Conversation, as one that hath indeed and in Truth experienced how good and gracious the LORD is: I bless GOD I can truly say, that my hottest Conflicts are against those Sins which are obvious only to the Eye of GOD, even my sinful Thoughts, tho' they come not into Action; O many a sad Heart have I had when I have con∣sidered the Vileness of my Thoughts, and yet have been unblameable in my Conversation and this is still my daily Sorrow, and therefore I trust they shall never be my Ruin, but that the
<PB N="16" REF="004841_0016_100E00116156DDC8"/>
LORD will shortly rejoyce the Heart of his poor Servant, in giving me the Victory over these and all my other inbred Corruptions, which have so often made a separation between my dear Lord and my poor Soul.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> I find a great Change in my Heart as touching the Word of GOD, for whereas heretofore like a Wretch as I was, I esteemed a Play-Book before it, now, blessed be the LORD, I prize it before all other, and good Reason have I for it, for by it hath the LORD quickned me, and therefore as long as I live I will give up my self to walk according to the Rule of it, begging the Spirit of GOD to open the Mystery of it to me, that so I might not only have the Letter, but the very Mind of CHRIST.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> I see nothing in my self that makes me more worthy of Salvation than another. I know that I have deserved to lie in Flames, as well as any that are now in the Place of Torments, and that nothing but Mercy hath stept between my Soul and everlasting Burnings, and therefore I heartily wish that I might always be admiring of this free Grace of GOD in chusing me before the Foundation of the World was laid, so un∣worthy a Creature as I am, to set his Love upon me and let go so many Thousands, that were more capable to bring Glory to his Name than I am: O the height and depth, and breadth, and length of this Love of GOD in CHRIST JESUS, which hath abounded to me a poor and unworth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Creature! It is indeed such a Love as passeth Knowledge, and therefore I can never sufficiently admire it, while I am here in the Body, which makes me long to be dissolved, that so I might know it more clearly, and be swallowed up in the eternal Admiration of it. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<Q><PB N="17" REF="004841_0017_100E0012E7BADA48"/>
<HI>And these are my Principles, which I trust I shall hold fast even to my Death.</HI></Q>
<P>I Believe that the Scriptures contained in the Old and New-Testament, are the Word of God, written by the Prophets and Holy Men, as they were inspired by God, to be the Rule of Faith and Life to his People; I believe all that God in his Word wills me to believe, being perswaded by the Spirit of God concerning the Truth of it: I be∣lieve that there is one only eternal God, who hath his Being from himself, and given a Being to all his Creatures, both in Heaven and Earth, and under the Earth, and from Eternity to Eternity doth whatsoever he will: I believe that this eter∣nal God-head, is distinguished into three Persons, the Father begetting, the Son begotten, and the Holy, Ghost proceeding from them both: I be∣lieve that God created Man in his own Image, in Righteousness, and Holiness, giving him Dominion over all the Creatures, and likewise gave him Li∣berty to continue in this happy Condition if he would, but he having Liberty to stand or to fall in his own Hand, quickly lost that Happiness which God had instated him in, by yeilding to the In∣ticements of Satan, so that breaking the Commands of God, he brought a Curse upon himself, and all his Posterity, so that all Mankind by Nature are now in a miserable Condition, Children of Wrath, Heirs of Hell, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And I do believe, that God from Eternity knew what Man would do when he had created him, so that <HI>Adam's</HI> Fall did but usher in, as it were, as greater Blessedness: For I do believe there hath been an eternal Covenant between the Father and the Son, in the electing some to Life even before the Foundation of the Earth was laid; So that no

sooner had Man fallen, but God promised a Savi∣our, even the Lord Jesus Christ, who in his Di∣vine Nature is in all Things equal with God the Father, and that such was his exceeding Love and Pity to poor lost Creatures that had broken his Commands, and made themselves liable to the Curse, that rather than they should perish, he hath laid aside the Robes of his Glory and took upon him the Nature of Man, but without Sins; and that he was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of a Virgin, and while he was on Earth, was loaded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ich Reproaches and Scorns, and did at last suffer upon the Cross for the Sins of his Elect, where he bore the Weight of God's Wrath in his Soul, by his Heaviness in his Agony, and satisfied the Justice of God in his Body, which was crucified till he died; and I believe that he was buried, and that the third Day he rose again from the Dead, having con∣quered Sin, Death and Hell, for Believers, and that he was seen of his Disciples, and others, forty Days after his Resurrection, and in their Sight did ascend into Heaven, with the same Body which was crucified upon the Cross, where he is set down at the right Hand of the Ma∣jesty on High, and is become a glorious Media∣tor between God and Man, being anointed of God to be an eternal King, Priest, and Prophet to the Saints, whose Peace he hath purchased by the Blood of his Cross: And I believe, that at the last and great Day, the Lord Jesus when all his Elect are gathered in, will rend the Heavens and come down to Judge the World in Righteousness, when all Nations shall be ga∣thered before him, even they that Sleep in the Dust of the Earth shall awake, some to ever∣lasting

Life, and some to Shame and everlasting Contempt: and I believe that those which are a∣live at the coming of the Lord, shall be caught up into the Clouds, together with those that were asleep in Jesus, to meet the Lord in the Air, where they shall sit with Christ upon Thrones to Judge all the Hypocrites and Unbelievers, to eternal Damnation both of Soul and Body into Hell, where the Worm dieth not, and the Fire never shall be quenched; &amp; the Wicked being gone into everlasting Punishment: I believe that the Righteous shall enter into Life eternal, where they shall for ever be Singing of Praises, and Hallelujahs to him who loved them, and washed them from their Sins in his own Blood.</P>
<P>These are my Principles, and I trust the LORD will so fix me in them, that I may never be tossed too and fro with contrary Winds of Doc∣trine, as too many in these latter Days are; nay I am even at this Time perswaded by the LORD that I shall not be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed away by the Errors of the Wicked, because the LORD hath not only rightly informed my Judgment con∣cerning these Things, but hath also given me good Hope through Grace, that he is my Fa∣ther, the LORD JESUS having died for my Sins, and risen again for my Justification, and this is that which brings Comfort to my Soul▪ and makes me to rejoice, tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot seeing, yet believ∣ing, even with Joy unspeakable and full of Glory; so I doubt not but the LORD JESUS my dear Redeemer, will so support me by his Grace that whatsoever my Condition hath been or shall be here in this little Moment of Time, yet that I shall not fail of Salvation through Christ in Heaven for ever, for in him only is my Hope,

and I will make mention of his Righteousness, and of his only, who is the LORD my Righte∣ness; and therefore to him be all the Glory given now and for evermore, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>This Confession of my Faith and my Experi∣ences was written in a Time of sweet Peace: my Reasons why I write them were these.</P>
<P N="1">1. Because formerly when I had enjoyed the sweet Presence of GOD, and been for the Time filled with Rejoycing, yet when GOD had with∣drawn the Light of his Countenance from me, I presently fell to questioning all the Dealings of GOD with me, and so dishonoured GOD by my Unbelief; so that now being under the Sense of Love, and being desirous for the Time to come to glorify GOD more in the great Work of believing, I write down my Experiences, hoping they may be sweet Supports to me in a Time of Darkness.</P>
<P N="2">2. My desire to treasure up the Experiences which I have had of God's Goodness to me, was another Reason why I write them, knowing how apt I am to let slip out of my Remembrance that which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> good.</P>
<P N="3">3. I have been often called upon to see that my Principles be right, and to make sure my Evidences for Heaven; and therefore that I may testify my Obedience to GOD and his Word, and that I might increase my Joy in the LORD, by believing more firmly what the LORD had done for my Soul, I set about the Work of Heart-searching, to see what I could find in me that brought me within the compass of everlasting Blessedness; and some Things I found, blessed be the LORD, which I thought

was worthy to be recorded, which was his own Work in me and for me, and therefore I write them down, and heartily desire that that GOD may have the Glory of his own Grace: For I know he only hath wrought all my Works in me, for of my self I am not able to think a good Thought, speak a good Word, or do a good Action. And I trust that the LORD will perfect that which concerns me, and not forsake the Work of his own Hands, that so I may be to the Praise of the Glory of his Grace all the Days of my Life.</P>
