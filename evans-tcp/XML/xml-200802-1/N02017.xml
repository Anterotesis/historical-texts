<HEAD><HI>A Vindication,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P N="1">§ 1. THE <HI>Sacred Oracles,</HI> of our Blessed SAVIOUR, ev'ry where charge us, to treat the Ministers of Religion with a becoming Esteem &amp; Vene∣ration. The APOSTLE, <HI>beseeches us to know them, that labour among us, and are over us, in the Lord, and admonish us, and esteem them very highly for their Works sake.</HI> Nor is this inculcated upon us, as a <HI>Duty</HI> only; but recommended to us, as our <HI>Interest.</HI> And the reverse is, a sure Method to bring the Blessed <HI>Truths,</HI> which they deliver, into Contempt and Ridicule; and banish all seri∣ous Religion out of the World. A finish'd <HI>Strata∣gem of the Devil</HI>! To this purpose one of our very Reverend DIVINES well expresses himself! <Q>As a corrupt, ignorant &amp; vicious Clergy, is one of the darkest &amp; most comprehensive Infelicities, under which the Rulers of the darkness of this World, hold it putrifying, yea, the grand cause of all the <HI>Corruption,</HI> in which Mankind lye gene∣rally languishing and perishing: And it is not for nothing, that when the <HI>Kingdom of our GOD</HI> comes on, this must be one Introduction or Con∣comitant of it; <HI>Thus says the Lord God, behold I am against the Shepherds, and I will cause them to cease from feeding the Flocks, for I will de∣liver
<PB N="2" REF="002396_0003_0FDB39888E9980C8"/>my Flock from their mouth.</HI> So the Re∣verse of this, is, a set of <HI>Good Men</HI> inspired with an holy <HI>Zeal</HI> to do good, who like <HI>Angels, flying thro' the midst of Heaven,</HI> Preach nothing but the <HI>Everlasting Gospel,</HI> with the true <HI>Spirit</HI> of it unto them <HI>who dwell upon the Earth</HI>: Cer∣tainly such Men are the <HI>Stars</HI> whom GOD <HI>calls by their Names,</HI> they <HI>shine as Lights</HI> in the World, in their benign Influences; the Blessings of the People that enjoy them are wonderful! are wonderful!</Q></P>
<P N="2">§ 2. BOSTON may boast of almost an unpa∣ralel'd Happiness in their MINISTERS; some of us, have travel'd to other, and diverse parts of the World; and we sincerely prosess, we never saw the Place that excelled BOSTON in this re∣spect. GOD has indulged to this People a very <HI>Candid, Learned</HI> and <HI>Religious</HI> set of Men, who in all things unbiassedly consult the good of their respective Flocks; nor do they intermeddle with <HI>other Men's Affairs</HI> more than what is proper to their Function. 'Tis this endears them unto us, and makes us rejoyce in them; and offer our thanks to GOD for the <HI>Gifts</HI> and <HI>Graces</HI> that shine so visibly in them. And we thought our <HI>Neighbours</HI> were all sensible of the <HI>invaluable Bles∣sings of</HI> GOD to us, in this Regard: But to our Astonishment, we see <HI>some</HI> in this Place so <HI>daring∣ly Frofane,</HI> as to Libel and Lampoon <HI>these holy Servants</HI> of our Blessed JESUS; and <HI>others</HI> so foolishly fond of their <HI>Invectives,</HI> as to counte∣nance and promote them; and this, among <HI>sober</HI> Persons, and <HI>Members</HI> of our <HI>Churches.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="3" REF="002396_0004_0FDB398A38F83A80"/>§ 3. OF late, there has been Published, (it may be spoken to our dishonour) several <HI>detracting</HI> and <HI>scandalous Pamphlets,</HI> tending to render the MINISTRY <HI>Vain</HI> and <HI>Ridiculous.</HI> In these, this <HI>Sacred Order of Men</HI> has been <HI>Strangely</HI> represented, and <HI>horribly</HI> animaverted upon. Many things have been charged on them, of which they been in∣tirely <HI>Innocent,</HI> and many things that <HI>it is their Glory they have spoke them,</HI> have been most ma∣liciously perverted and equivocated. And now, who should the Authors of these be, but STRAN∣GERS OF ABJECTS, which inhances their <HI>Folly,</HI> and makes their <HI>Impudence</HI> the more brazen and flagitious. Above all, we wonder at a <HI>Weekly Paper,</HI> which has been, and is now, Published, either <HI>designedly,</HI> to affront our Ministers, and render them Odious; or else, it has hitherto, wretchedly deviated from it's <HI>ultimate Intent,</HI> and been notoriously prostituted to that <HI>Hellish Servi∣tude.</HI> We know no <HI>Nation</HI> under the Sun, that has so openly and assiduously insulted the MINIS∣TERS of their GOD; and been so strenuous, in their Endeavours, to make them despicable and detestable to their <HI>People,</HI> as the <HI>Authors</HI> of this scandalous <HI>Libel.</HI></P>
<P N="4">§ 4. THAT the World may see this Represen∣tation is just, we will recite a few Passages (as a Specimen) from their Writings, passing over the many indirect and scandalous Glances at them. In the Writings of <HI>John Williams</HI> (Tobacconist)
<Q>The Ministers have generally revolted from the good old way, and have set up a way that their Fathers know not of, neither entered it into their hearts, to allude unto <HI>Jr.</HI> 5.23. They are <HI>revolted
<PB N="4" REF="002396_0005_0FDB398B8D737758"/>and gone.</HI> Again, <HI>Defective in morals,</HI> — The <HI>causes of Divisions.</HI> — People are afraid the Ministers do affect to Rule over them, in <HI>Tempo∣rals,</HI> as the Pope of <HI>Rome</HI> does <HI>Temporally</HI> as well as <HI>Spiritually</HI> rule and determine things —.</Q></P>
<P>In the Learned <HI>Taliacotius,</HI> <Q>The Infatuations in this Country seem always to have proceeded from some of those who call themselves the Sons of <HI>Levi.</HI> They are represented as Men of WICKED DESIRES — and <HI>impious, ignorant</HI> &amp; <HI>brasen∣faced. Prob Fides! Oh Impiety! Oh Brass! In the Reflections on the Town Meeting, Aug.</HI> 11. 1721. It is <HI>thought by three parts of this Town</HI> that its better they were a-foot with a good pair of Shoes on their Feet, and a Staff in their hands.— In∣cendiaries of Strife &amp; Division. In the <HI>Courant,</HI> No. 23. <HI>Most of the Ministers are for it &amp; that induces me to think, it is from the Devil.</HI> No. 25. <HI>The Instruments of mis∣chief &amp; trouble both in Church &amp; State, from the Witchcraft to Inoculation —. Formerly there were many grave &amp; wise Ministers, but now there are few.</HI> ***</Q> But 'tis needless and endless to quote, the Passages are so notorious and numerous.</P>
<P N="5">§ 5. THESE <HI>Reflections</HI> upon and <HI>Abuses</HI> of this <HI>Sacred Order of Men,</HI> are sufficient, to make the most professed <HI>Libertine</HI> blush. Who is there that can see all this, the MINISTERS, by whom they expect to be brought home to CHRIST, thus auda∣ciously insulted, thus vilely trampled upon, and impiously buffoon'd, by the profane Sons of <HI>Corah,</HI> and tamely &amp; silently bear it. 'Tis this amazes, &amp; alarms us, and we think it a <HI>Duty</HI> indispensibly
<PB N="5" REF="002396_0006_0FDB398D00312608"/>incumbent upon us, more thoroughly to <HI>enquire into the Characters of our</HI> MINISTERS, whether they are worthy of these <HI>Barbarous Reflections,</HI> yea or no? We cannot answer the neglect of this; if we should, our <HI>Consciences</HI> would one Day, as a <HI>Flaming Witness</HI> flush our <HI>Guilt</HI> in our Faces. We are their <HI>People,</HI> and hope by their precious <HI>Mini∣stry</HI> to be brought home to GOD, &amp; Everlasting Life; and therefore we are bound to appear in their <HI>Just Vindication</HI>; and rescue our Children, and our Neighbours from the deadly <HI>Poison,</HI> which these <HI>Children</HI> of the Old <HI>Serpent</HI> would infuse into them. And here first, We cannot but admire the Moderation, and consummate Patience of our PASTORS, amidst these outragious and provoking Abuses &amp; Scandals. They shine with an <HI>Unshaken Constancy,</HI> and still go on to <HI>Minister</HI> in those very parts of their <HI>Office,</HI> that ten Thousand difficulties have conspired to obstruct them in. Their Dis∣charge of their <HI>Publick Ministry</HI> is too well known, to need a Report of ours, and their <HI>Prayers</HI> &amp; <HI>Ser∣mons</HI> proclaim them, to be <HI>Workmen</HI> that need not be ashamed. Their <HI>Printed Labours</HI> are incon∣testable Testimonies of their <HI>Abilities</HI>; and speak an <HI>excellent Spirit</HI> breathing in them. Their nine <HI>Lectures</HI> upon <HI>Early Piety,</HI> Preached in so remarka∣ble a Time, that it plainly shou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, GOD was with them: These (if nothing else) recommend them to the <HI>Love</HI> &amp; <HI>Esteem</HI> of all <HI>good People</HI>; and we do not wonder to see the <HI>Devil</HI> so earnest in his <HI>revenges</HI> upon them. Their <HI>Pastoral Visits</HI> are wisely, painfully &amp; faithfully manag'd; and if we enquire into their more <HI>private Conversation,</HI> we find them <HI>shining Instances,</HI> of the most <HI>refined
<PB N="6" REF="002396_0007_0FDB398F8A775240"/>Virtue</HI> &amp; <HI>Religion.</HI> They are always ready <HI>to do Good,</HI> and <HI>Rejoice</HI> in all <HI>Opportunities</HI> for it. Ne∣ver are they addressed by any in Affliction, but they administer Comfort, and the <HI>Afflicted</HI> find the <HI>Bowels</HI> of a <HI>Father</HI> in them; and their <HI>Liberalities</HI> are also truly extraordinary. We never enjoy their <HI>Company,</HI> but their Savoury &amp; Entertaining <HI>Dis∣course</HI> evidently discovers an Internal <HI>Source</HI> of <HI>Goodness</HI> in them; and the <HI>Blame</HI> centers upon ourselves, if we grow not <HI>better</HI> &amp; <HI>wiser</HI> by it. Some of them have <HI>great names</HI> in distant Lands; and <HI>foreign Countries</HI> have a great <HI>Vene∣ration</HI> for them. But to conclude their <HI>Praises,</HI> they are <HI>more precious than the fine gold; than the golden wedge of Ophir.</HI></P>
<P N="6">§ 6. BUT now, what is there can justify the <HI>virulent</HI> and <HI>unwearied</HI> Endeavours of these <HI>Wicked Men</HI> to make them Odious? The only <HI>pre∣text</HI> they have is, That the MINISTERS have in∣termedled with <HI>Civil</HI> Affairs, and <HI>gone out of their Line</HI>; and the only Instance they can give of this, (for the others are only groundless Surmises, or open Calumnies) is this, When the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> was first breaking into the Town, and every one fore∣saw and feared a dreadful Mortality; these <HI>good Men</HI> were apprised of a safe Method, which they by the ordinary Blessing of GOD, hoped might be an Instrument of saving many <HI>Lives.</HI> This <HI>Me∣thod</HI> came to them with very authentic Recom∣mendations; nor was ever, any <HI>Remedy</HI> attended with a more uninterrupted, &amp; remarkable <HI>Success</HI> than this. This they communicated to the PHY∣SICIANS; urging them, (not to put it into practice, as the <HI>News-Letter</HI> declares, but) to <HI>meet together,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="002396_0008_0FDB39927637CA90"/>and <HI>consult</HI> how far, or whether at all, it might be practis'd; and desiring they would <HI>proceed</HI> with <HI>mutual Assistances,</HI> each to t'other, as GOD should direct them. And to do some justice by the way to that <HI>eminent Person,</HI> the <HI>Learned</HI> Dr. COTTON MATHER, <HI>Fellow of the Royal Society</HI> (who to his <HI>honour</HI>) was the principal <HI>Instrument,</HI> in promo∣ving this <HI>Method</HI> among us: (and who now dis∣dains to draw his <HI>generous Pen</HI> for his own <HI>Vindication,</HI> against the many foolish <HI>Pamphlets</HI> that are pointed at him; and who changes not his <HI>Temper</HI> for all their inviduous Calumnies;) we will here transcribe the <HI>Words</HI> with which he con∣cludes his <HI>Address</HI> to the <HI>Physicians</HI>; Dated, <HI>June</HI> 6. 1721. <Q>I will only say, (writes the DOCTOR) that inasmuch as the Practice of suf∣fering and preventing the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> in the way of <HI>Inoculation</HI> has never yet, (as far as I have heard) been introduced into our <HI>Nation</HI>; where there are so many that would give <HI>great Sums,</HI> to have their Lives insur'd, from the <HI>dangers</HI> of this dreadful <HI>Distemper,</HI> nor has ever any one in all <HI>America</HI> ever yet, made the tryal of it (tho' we have several <HI>Africans</HI> among us, as I now find, who tryed it in their own <HI>Country</HI>) I cannot but move it be WARILY proceeded in. I durst not yet engage, that the <HI>Success</HI> of the tryal here will be the same, as has hitherto been in the other <HI>Hemisphere.</HI> But I am very confident, no person would miscarry in it, but what must most certainly have miscarried upon taking it the <HI>Common way.</HI> And I would humbly <HI>advise,</HI> that it be never made, but under the management, of a <HI>Skilful Physician,</HI> who will wisely pre∣pare
<PB N="8" REF="002396_0009_0FDB399484632370"/>the Body for it before he performs the O∣peration. <HI>Gentleman,</HI> My <HI>request</HI> is, that you would <HI>meet for a Consultation</HI> upon this Occasion, and to <HI>deliberate</HI> upon it, that whoever first be∣gins this practise, (<HI>if you approve that it should be begun at all</HI>) may have the concurrence of his <HI>worthy Brethren</HI> to fortify him in it —.</Q></P>
<P>Thus the Doctor.</P>
<P>WE appeal to the whole World, whether this <HI>Gentleman went out of his line,</HI> or did any thing, but what became a <HI>Minister,</HI> a <HI>Christian,</HI> or a <HI>Gen∣tleman,</HI> in his address. And this is all the blame, they do with any <HI>Colour</HI> charge upon him, &amp; which has given <HI>Life</HI> to so many monstrous, and bitter <HI>Invectives</HI> against him. But to return from this Excursion. The <HI>Physicians</HI> never met, nor consulted about this <HI>Method,</HI> according to the <HI>de∣sires</HI> of the MINISTERS, till one of them began the Experiment upon his <HI>Family.</HI> He had just reason to apprehend them in danger of being In∣fected the <HI>Common way</HI>: and here, I cannot omit to observe the <HI>happy juncture</HI> of <HI>Affairs</HI> that <HI>united,</HI> to render this his Attempt <HI>Innocent</HI> &amp; <HI>Blameless</HI> The worthy TOWNSMEN had taken the <HI>Guards</HI> off the <HI>Infected houses,</HI> and in effect proclaim'd the <HI>Infection</HI> so prevalent, that 'twould be in vain, to strive to suppress it. By this <HI>act</HI> the <HI>Nurses</HI> were commissioned, to air themselves, who had been stifled, for a considerable Time, by a close Confine∣ment with the <HI>Sick: Liberty</HI> was declared to them to walk the Streets; and now as the <HI>necessities</HI> of the <HI>Sick</HI> urged, these <HI>Infected persons</HI> might go to our <HI>Doctors</HI> upon any occasion; and any heedless or head-strong <HI>Neighbours</HI> run in to visit their con∣tagious
<PB N="9" REF="002396_0010_0FDB399600E96600"/><HI>Friends</HI>; which must necessarily render their <HI>Families</HI> very obnoxtious to the distemper. This clearly evinces the <HI>eminency</HI> of the <HI>danger</HI> his Family was in; and in a great measure vindi∣cates his procedure. But notwithstanding, a <HI>mighty Storm</HI> was raised, &amp; a saucy <HI>Libel</HI> published, which among other things demanded an answer to a <HI>Case of Conscience.</HI> Six MINISTERS of BOSTON under∣took to give a proper answer to the Demand, wherein they did some justice to the <HI>Gentleman</HI> that <HI>that Paper</HI> had <HI>unjustly</HI> reproached. After this, the MINISTERS were silent for several Months, till at length the constant <HI>Success</HI> of the Experi∣ment encouraged <HI>Some</HI> of them to publish their <HI>Sentiments</HI> on this subject, especially what related <HI>to the case of Conscience.</HI> And here, we think it very strange &amp; rediculous, to see the <HI>Satyrists</HI> play the Divine, and deny that it falls under the Cognizance of our MINISTERS, when so many People pretend CONSCIENCE in the matter. This is to <HI>boast</HI> of their own Divinity, as if they were the only proper <HI>judges</HI> of what is the part of a <HI>Divine,</HI> and to <HI>Counterpoint</HI> their own <HI>Skill</HI> and <HI>Judgment</HI> to that of our famous <HI>Professors.</HI> But we will not ask who <HI>go out of their line now</HI>? This is a full History of the <HI>crimes</HI> charged on the <HI>Mi∣nisters,</HI> wherein they have <HI>gone out of their line</HI>: That is to say, When they saw their <HI>People</HI> dying about them, and their dearest <HI>Friends</HI> they had, <HI>Gasping for their Breath,</HI> they did not cast off all <HI>bowels</HI> of <HI>compassion,</HI> and be <HI>content</HI> that no further tryal should be made of a <HI>Method,</HI> that they ap∣prehended would deliver them from their <HI>danger.</HI></P>
<P N="7"><PB N="10" REF="002396_0011_0FDB39978A1511E8"/>§ 7. WE will not on this occasion enquire, how far our <HI>Practitioners</HI> &amp; late <HI>Libellers</HI> have <HI>gone out of their line.</HI> But this we remark, that if any <HI>Person,</HI> of any Profession, had been appri∣sed of a <HI>safe Method</HI> to preserve his <HI>Neighbour's</HI> Life, in a Time of common danger, and had not <HI>communicated</HI> it to him, he had approved himself to be of a very un-natural, and un-christian <HI>Tem∣per.</HI> And our MINISTERS especially, who are <HI>Sluring Patterns</HI> of <HI>Charity,</HI> would have appear'd with a <HI>distinguisht Blackness,</HI> had they neglected this good Office to the <HI>Flocks</HI> intrusted with them. How very unjust and wicked then are the <HI>Obloquies</HI> and <HI>Outrages</HI> which have been for this Cause hea∣ped upon them. The famous Mr. <HI>Thomas Thacher</HI> was not reviled, for <HI>going out of his line,</HI> when he Published a Sheet of Directions, relating to the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> Forty three Years since. And seve∣ral eminent MINISTERS in the <HI>Country,</HI> have practised <HI>Physick,</HI> and several do so at this Day, and we could never hear them revil'd for <HI>going out of their line</HI>: And possibly, there are among the MINISTERS of BOSTON, such as the best <HI>Physicians</HI> in the Land, need not be ashamed to <HI>advice</HI> withal.</P>
<P N="8">§ 8. AFTER all, We have often heard that Maxim, <HI>That a Power to do Good not only gives a right, to the doing of it, but makes the doing it a Duty.</HI> And we humbly conceive, if it were more regarded, the <HI>World</HI> would many ways <HI>reap</HI> the <HI>Benefit</HI> of it. And to us it is very evident, that he that sees his <HI>Neighbour</HI> exposed to any great danger, and can relieve him; not only has a <HI>Right,</HI> but should look on it as his <HI>Duty,</HI> to do so.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="11" REF="002396_0012_0FDB399B13D360E0"/>§ 9. Now this being all the <HI>Crime,</HI> that is with any <HI>Shadow</HI> of <HI>Reason</HI> charged upon our <HI>Mi∣nisters,</HI> we cannot but look upon it, as the great∣est <HI>inhumanity</HI> and blacken <HI>ingratitude</HI> to treat them in such a manner as they have been. We ought rather to value &amp; esteem them; love and thank them, for their Goodness; and bless GOD for making them the <HI>Instruments</HI> of so much Good to us, and to our Families. We are sure the great <HI>Success</HI> of the <HI>Practice,</HI> which they hoped so well of, has caused many among us to wish, that in∣stead of such base Methods, as have been taken to oppose it, a <HI>regular management</HI> of it had been agreed upon; and some are of Opinion, that our <HI>Ministers</HI> may say to their wasted People, what the <HI>Apostle</HI> did upon the <HI>Shipwreck, Sirs, You should have hearkned unto me, and not have gained this Harm and Loss.</HI></P>
<P N="10">§ 10. BUT we will not enter into the Contro∣versy, what we observe is, that according to this <HI>way</HI> of treating the <HI>Ministers,</HI> which is now in <HI>Fashion,</HI> it will come to this; If in a Time of com∣mon Distress, they with great Modesty offer their <HI>Opinion</HI> for the <HI>Common good,</HI> they shall be cen∣sured, for <HI>going out of their line.</HI> If on a Day of <HI>Publick Thanksgiving,</HI> they mention Publick Mer∣cies, as those of a <HI>good Government,</HI> &amp;c. or if they rebuke the growing <HI>Sins</HI> of the Times, and put any <HI>notorious Transgressors</HI> in mind of the awful Threatnings, pronounced <HI>in the Holy Writings</HI> against them; it shall be deem'd <HI>going out of their line</HI>; yea, their <HI>Warning</HI> of the <HI>wicked</HI> shall be ridiculously called, a <HI>Cursing of them.</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="002396_0013_0FDB399BFA3B5170"/>If this <HI>impious</HI> &amp; Satanic Custom prevail, we shall involve our selves into a thousand pernicious <HI>Evils.</HI> Our <HI>Children</HI> will imbibe the <HI>Poison,</HI> and perish like the <HI>Children of Bethel</HI>; and our Elder People will <HI>pine away in their Iniquities.</HI> Our <HI>Reprovers</HI> and <HI>Prophets</HI> being Silenced, <HI>Iniquity</HI> and every <HI>Abomination</HI> will break in among us, and bear down like an irresistable Torrent, all <HI>Virtue,</HI> and <HI>Religion</HI> before it. And what is mostly to be de∣precated, all manner of <HI>Spiritual Plagues</HI> will follow this our degeneracy; and the <HI>Town</HI> grow ripe for a <HI>Wrath unto the Uttermost.</HI> We read, <HI>They mocked the Messengers of GOD, and misused his Prophets, until the Wrath of the Lord arose a∣gainst his People, and there was no Remedy.</HI> In what a deplorable Condition should we be, if <HI>Hea∣ven</HI> should pronounce this direful <HI>fate</HI> upon us; or, if the intolerable <HI>invectives</HI> read among us, against our Holy <HI>Ministers,</HI> should provoke GOD to deprive us of these <HI>Invaluable Blessings,</HI> and punish us with a <HI>Clergy,</HI> that should be <HI>Salt without Savour,</HI> and <HI>Clouds without Rain,</HI> as we have seen in other Places.</P>
<P N="11">§ 11. IN the mean time, we commiserate the deplorable <HI>State</HI> of those, who signalize themselves by their <HI>Malice</HI> &amp; Mischief against these faithful <HI>Servants</HI> of GOD. We have seen a Conspicu∣ous <HI>blast</HI> from Heaven attending such, and GOD has so remarkably revenged the Iniquity, that none but such as are given over to a <HI>penal hard∣ness of heart,</HI> can hide their Fear and Trembling. And when we consider, the <HI>meekness</HI> of our <HI>Mi∣nisters</HI> under these <HI>Abuses,</HI> imitating their <HI>Glo∣rious</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="002396_0014_0FDB399E0FF88FE0"/><HI>Master,</HI> who remained <HI>as dumb under the Shearers.</HI> We cannot but the more depre∣cate the fearful condition of these <HI>Revilers,</HI> and earnestly call upon our dear <HI>Freinds</HI> and <HI>Neigh∣bours,</HI> to depart from the <HI>Tents</HI> of these <HI>Wicked Men,</HI> least they perish with them. And we encourage our selves, that all our <HI>virtuous Neighbours</HI> will unite, to discourage these <HI>Wick∣ed Libels.</HI> But whether this will be taken well by them, or no, sure we are, it will be accep∣table to our <HI>Blessed Saviour,</HI> who is greatly offended at them who wrong His faithful <HI>Servants,</HI> and calls from <HI>Heaven, Why persecute ye me</HI>?</P>
<P N="12">§ 12. However, Our Beloved <HI>Pastors,</HI> We beseech you not to be in the least discouraged in your faithful Services; We, who hope, to be part of your <HI>Crown</HI> at the <HI>Coming</HI> of our <HI>Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> earnestly intreat you to go on very chearfully &amp; couragiously in the <HI>Service</HI> of your great <HI>Master.</HI> You have many Cordial &amp; Sin∣cere <HI>Freinds</HI> among us, who love and esteem you the more, and Pray &amp; Plead the more with <HI>Heaven</HI> for you, because of these <HI>Cruel Enemies,</HI> And we doubt not, but that Our <HI>Blessed Sa∣viour</HI> (whose you are, and whom you serve) will still honour you to do great <HI>Service</HI> for Him, and rescue your <HI>Opportunities</HI> to do good, from the malicious and wicked <HI>Attempts</HI> of your <HI>Adver∣saries</HI>; and at length, appear to your <HI>Joy</HI> and their unspeakable <HI>Shame</HI> &amp; <HI>Confusion.</HI></P>
<P>To close all, By what we have said, We sup∣pose that we shall be accounted, (by some)
<PB N="14" REF="002396_0015_0FDB39A1A4C617D0"/><HI>Busy Inoculators,</HI> and would have none to write on the Subject, but such as approve the Practice; but we would not be so misrepresented, but would have every one (if he sees cause) that has Leisure and Capacity to instruct his Neighbours, to im∣prove his Talent, provided he does not stuff his Com∣posures with scandalous Reflections, such as we have, and every <HI>Christian</HI> and <HI>Gentleman</HI> will de∣clare against. We are of opinion, that Persons may differ in their <HI>Sentiments</HI> about this Practice, without declaring themselves <HI>Open</HI> Enemies to one another, and neglecting <HI>Christian</HI> and <HI>Civil</HI> Con∣versation; and may notwithstanding, <HI>Unite</HI> in all those things which tend to promote the <HI>Com∣mon Good.</HI> We may with more reason be angry, that two Persons do not <HI>Look</HI> alike, than that they do not in all things <HI>Think</HI> just alike. We are of opinion, that in such Cases as these, <HI>Every Person ought to Act according to his own Light</HI>; and we should not <HI>Unchristianly</HI> Censure and Con∣demn one another for the <HI>Use</HI> or <HI>Neglect</HI> of it, but preserve a due <HI>Esteem</HI> and Veneration for each other, and perform all <HI>Christian</HI> and <HI>Neighbourly</HI> offices notwithstanding; which, that we of this <HI>Place</HI> may do, we shall not be wanting in our <HI>hearty</HI> Endeavours, and <HI>sincere</HI> Addresses to the Throne of Grace —. To which every <HI>Friend</HI> of the <HI>Publick</HI> will add his AMEN.</P>
