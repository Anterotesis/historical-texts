<HEAD>TO THE Unprejudic'd Reader.</HEAD>
<P>THIS following Narrative, when taken was not intended for publick View, only for my own private Satisfaction; but since her Death, shewing it to some Friends, and Relations which so much admir'd the Grace of GOD to her, that they ear∣nestly requested it might be printed; some of them having several Children, made use of it as an Argu∣ment to prevail with me; as also that they did hope the LORD would bless <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> These Desires, with some Scriptures, which the Lord was pleas'd to set home upon my Mind, I was made to believe it was my Duty to publish it; I then laying aside carnal Reason consented it should. It is chiefly intended for, and adapted to young Ones, it may be also a re∣freshing &amp; teaching to older Ones, if GOD pleas;e He has said <HI>destroy it not, for a Belssing is in it;</HI> it was His own Work upon her Soul, and not the product of Nature, nor the strength of Education as some may vainly imagin. but sovereign &amp; bound∣less Grace: O may all the Glory be given to God attributing nothing to second Causes but as Instru∣ments in His Hand, which He sees good in His In∣finite Wisdom, sometimes to make use of, to bring about his own Designs, lest we rob him of his Ho∣nour: 'tis Grace makes to differ &amp; only the Blood of Christ that cleanseth from all Sin, therefore he should have all the Glory.

<HEAD>Cartaret Rede, Daughter of Mr. John Rede, late of Potton, Gen∣tleman, near the City of Sarum, Wiltshire, was born the 7th of January, 1693.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN she was about 4 Years of Age, she being asked who was her greatest Enemy, she reply'd <HI>SIN</HI> was her greatest Enemy. When she was between 4 and 5 Years of Age, she took great delight in reading the 2d of <HI>Luke;</HI> and when she read about <HI>Jo∣seph</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> that there was no room for them in the Inn, and that the Babe was laid in a Man∣ger, she burst out into a Passion of Tears, say∣ing, 'What! was there no room in the Inn for the Lord of Glory, but must He lie in a Man∣ger, among the Beasts. One Morning when she was no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> well, in Prayer she began thus: <HI>O Lord▪ look down upon me, and give me the Know∣lege, of thy self; take Sin out of my heart that I may be thy Child'</HI> with several other the like Ex∣pressions▪ When she had done, she said, I have a pretty Lesson in my Book, which is about GOD'S sending the Lord Jesus Christ to die for poor Sinners, and of his great Love and Mercy to poor

Creatures: Then said she, it may be the Lord may take me away before my Father and You. I told her she should not spend her Spirit. She reply'd, when I am with God and good Angels, I shall want neither Food nor Raiment, for God will give me all I want. A little while after, she said, <HI>Lord have Mercy upon me?</HI> He did re∣store me one Night, and I hope He will restore me again. Another time as she sat by the Fire, she said my heart trembles, and burst out into a Passion of Tears. I asking her what she did a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, she said I do offend the Lord in all I do: I took her to me, and told her it was true, she did Sin, she reply'd, that Christ Jesus came to save poor Sinners, &amp; with that seem'd to be satisfy'd: I do believe she was under some Conviction for Sin at that time.</P>
<P>This Evening being the 5th of <HI>Feb</HI> 1698. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Child going to her Aunt that had been very ill, said, Aunt, I have pray'd for you and have pray'd to God to teach me to pray to him.</P>
<P><HI>Feb.</HI> 6. In the Evening, the Maid putting on the Child's Linnen to go abroad the next Day, she asked me if she should not learn to dance, to which I reply'd, that she should, but that I was afraid it would take up her Mind from bet∣ter Things. Then she said I hope the Lord will keep me from Pride and Vanity; for it is the Lord that must keep me from sinning against him; for we can do nothing without Him; then she mentioned that Scripture, <HI>Let the Sinner forsake his Ways; and the unrighteous Man his Tho'ts and
<PB N="6" REF="010473_0006_0F7FC38827BE54E8"/>
return to the Lord, and he will have Mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</HI> Then said she, I must be more afraid of sinning against God, than being Whipt, for it is God that gives us every thing, Food and <HI>R</HI> aiment, all comes from Him and He has said, <HI>Call upon me in the Day of Trouble and I will hear thee, and deliver thee.</HI></P>
<P>The 14th. Instant in the Evening she cry'd for something I tho't not fit to give her, fearing it would make her sick; I ask'd her whether she was ready to die? she immediately answer'd Yes, if the Lord will take away Sin from me, then I shall go to Heaven, for I would not die in my Sins; for if I should, God hath said that such shall depart to the Devil and his Angels: The Lord knows all we do and say, and our very Thoughts; his Presence is every where; I must meditate upon God in the Night watches, and if I do, I shall rejoyce in him; Then she ment∣tion'd that Place of Scripture, Isaiah 55. 6. <HI>Seek the Lord while he may be found.</HI></P>
<P>The 26th Instant, complaining of a pain in her Ear she said it is the Lord that sends me this pain, I know how I can be sav'd, only by the Righteousness of Christ; for he hath said, <HI>they shall be my People, and I will be their GOD;</HI> her Father being by, said, that if she understood what she spake, she were fit for Church Communion; she answer'd him, I hope God will teach me to understand what I say, for he has promis'd me <HI>to write his Laws in my heart and put it in my in∣ward part,</HI> and I must pray to him, that I may
<PB N="7" REF="010473_0007_0F7FC38972AE1730"/>
never depart from him. And having a little ease, she said, the Lord hath eas'd me, and I must pray to him, for he hath said, <HI>Enter into your Clo∣set, and shut your Door and pray to your Father which is in secret, and your Father which seeth in secret shall reward you openly.</HI></P>
<P>The 27th Instant, having some Friends which came to spend a little time in Prayer with us, be∣fore they enter'd upon the Duty, the Child of her own accord went to them, and said, Pray to the Lord for me, that he would make me his Servant, that I may love, fear and obey him.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> the 9th being speaking of Pride by Way of Discourse, not minding the Child, she took it up saying, we must not be Proud, for God has said, <HI>He resisteth the Proud but giveth Grace to the Humble. God's ways are ways of Pleasantness, and all his Paths are Peace.</HI></P>
<P><HI>March</HI> the 11th. She speaking of Faith in Christ. said, none but such as believe shall be sav'd, mentioning that Scripture, Mark 16. 16. <HI>He that believeth shall be saved, and he that believ∣eth not shall be damned.</HI> The next Night she be∣ing a Bed, said to her Aunt, I hope God will draw me with Cords of Love, that I may run after Him. One Evening I being very ill, the Child seem'd much concern'd, and said, it may be the Lord may take you away in your Sleep, for he can do what he pleaseth; I said so he can, &amp; if he should I hope we shall meet in Heaven: She said Yes, that was a blessed place to be in, their is no sorrow nor no darkness, but joy
<PB N="8" REF="010473_0008_0F7FC389B46C74B8"/>
for evermore, Oh! what a Thing it is, that my Sins should be Pardon'd that are so vile? Then I ask'd her how she knew her Sins were Pardoned? she said, in and thro' Christ, God could Pardon her Sins, for I am nothing of my self, but he can do every Thing Another time she said, sometimes I do believe that Christ dy'd for my Sins, and rose again for my Juistfication; but sometimes I am afraid, and do not know whe∣ther He did or no. <HI>March</HI> 17 she said, as my Father was at Duty, this came into my Mind; that <HI>when Christ shall appear, we shall appear with him in Glory</HI> And at another time, this came into my Mind, that <HI>when Christ shall appear, we shall be like him, and we shall see him as he is.</HI> She further said, I can go to God in none but Christ and his Righte∣ousness, for I have no Righteosusnes but his; the Wicked eat the Bread of Wickedness, but we must wait for the Salvation of the Lord; and we must not only speak of the Things of God but we must act them, or else we mock God; the Lord give me a heart so to do; in Hell there is no rest, but crying out Day and Night. The Day we left <HI>London,</HI> I being in a low frame of Spirit, the Child came to me a lit∣tle before we took Coach, and said, I'll tell you what came into my Mind, this Text, <HI>And the Lord said unto Abraham, I am thy Shield, and thy exceeding great Reward,</HI> Gen 15 1 I could not but admire the Goodness of God, to send me such a suitable Word by the Mouth of such a Child.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> the 13th, being at an Inn, the Child
<PB N="9" REF="010473_0009_0F7FC38A846B83F8"/>
awoke very early, speaking to me, said, these words just now came into my Mind, that God does punish us much less than our iniquities do deserve: A little after she said, God brings Judgments upon Men and Beasts. Then I bid her go to Sleep, so she lay still a little while, and then she said I wish my Brother <HI>Charles</HI> may mind Faith in Christ, for <HI>every one that is in Christ, is a new Creature:</HI> The Lord does trouble us in this World, but in Heaven we shall have no Trouble.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> the 17th, she said Father, when we are in Heaven, we shall want no Food but be fill'd with Righteousness: Then she fetch'd that place of Scripture where Christ said to the Young Man, Luke 12. 33. <HI>Go sell that thou hast and thou shalt have Treasure in Heaven.</HI> Yesterday Morn∣ing she said to her Father, pray look me this place of Scripture, which just now came into my Mind, Colos. 3. 4. <HI>When Christ who is our life, shall appear, we shall appear with him in glory.</HI></P>
<P><HI>August</HI> the 19th. as I was reading the first of <HI>Proverbs Cartaret</HI> sitting by, when, I read the 26th verse, she said I must mind that, that God may not mock at me when Fear comes, saying, we must not be like the People of Old, to sit down to Eat and Drink and rise up to play: and speaking of the Power of God, she said, the Lord can preserve us <HI>thro' the Fire, and thro' the Water.</HI> In the Evening <HI>Cartaret</HI> went to her Father and said, Pray for me, that God would Pardon all my Sins, and that I might not only speak of the things of God, but be found doing;
<PB N="10" REF="010473_0010_0F7FC38B8F520EE0"/>
Pray that I may be with God when I die, and that He would take away this wicked Heart; And another time, a little time before we went to Duty, she said, to her Father, I desire you would Pray for me; he said, what shall I Pray for, for thee? she said, that God would keep me, and that He would give me a Heart to know Him, love and fear Him, and give me Faith in Christ, that I might have an Interest in Him; for, said she, He is the Maker of Heaven and Earth, and the Sea, and all that are therein.</P>
<P><HI>Sept.</HI> the 11th in the Evening, as she went up to Bed, she said to me, I desire, that when You pray to the Lord, you would remember me, and I will pray my self also; for 'tis said in Scripture, <HI>pray always.</HI> When she came up, she desir'd me to read her two Hymns, which she look'd out her self, about Christ's Death and Satisfaction, which read, she went to her Father, and said to him, we have sinful Hearts by Nature, and com∣ing to me again, on a sudden she was struck with a very great Pain in her Stomach, which caus'd her to cry out aloud, <HI>Ease me, and lay no more up∣on me than Thou wilt enable me to bear.</HI></P>
<P>O said she again, that I could say with <HI>David, It is good for me that I have been Afflicted</HI> I may say, it has been good for me; for before I was afflic∣ted, I went astray. I being much concern'd, she perceiving that I wept, she said, pray don't be troubled for me, you have cause to rejoice; for if I die, I shall be with God, and never Sin no more; she desir'd her Father to pray for her, a little be∣fore she was taken ill, she had been at Prayer,
<PB N="11" REF="010473_0011_0F7FC38C0CEF8DD0"/>
amongst other Expressions she had this; begging God that she might truly Repent, be a true Be∣liever in Christ, that God would give her a new Heart, and renew a right Spirit within her: As she went to Bed, she said, the Lord be with You, and keep you the approaching Day: The next Morning I went to take her up, she said, I bless God, I am much better; then she mention'd that place, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10. 37. saying, <HI>He that shall come, will come, and will not tarry:</HI> but Oh! that he may not come before I am Converted; for to such as look for him, he shall appear a second time.</P>
<P>This Day I was speaking of having an Issue made for her, she said, <HI>I had rather not, I would rather die, that I might sin no more.</HI> This Even∣ing I went up with the Maid to put her to Bed, she desir'd me to bless God on her behalf, and also to pray for her. <HI>Sept.</HI> 21st, she said, Father, where are these words? <HI>This is our God we have waited for him, we will joy and rejoyce in his Salva∣tion:</HI> he told her where it was, she looking it out read it: then said she, where is that word, <HI>The Earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof?</HI> I ask'd her why she ask'd for those places? she said because they came into her Mind. <HI>Sept.</HI> 29. she said to me, Mother, when I die I must leave all these Earthly Things behind me: About an Hour after, she said to her Sister and I, as I was coming up Stairs, these Words came into my Mind, <HI>According to the Day, so shall thy Strength be;</HI> I ask'd her what she did infer from that place? she said I shall have strength in my Soul▪ Some Hours after she mention'd the same place
<PB N="12" REF="010473_0012_0F7FC38CA92639B8"/>
I ask'd her what she should have that strength to do? she said to serve the Lord.</P>
<P><HI>Octob.</HI> the 1st, as I took her up, she fell to di∣course of the Things of God, saying, that they should be sav'd for whom God hath found a Ran∣som. The 2d Day, having done some childish Things, being taken soon after with a Pain in her Teeth; her Father told her the Lord did punish her for being Naughty; she burst into a Passion of Tears. I could not get from her what was the Matter for some time, but at last she said, Oh! that God would take this wicked Heart out of me! I have an abominable wicked Heart; I can∣not Repent of my self; if I did <HI>resist the Devil, he would fly from me;</HI> I am sorry I have griev'd You, pray forgive me: Just before she was taken ill, she was reading the 55th of <HI>Isaiah,</HI> she stopt and said, nothing but the Blood of Christ can cleanse me from Sin: I said, why so? if you are good, and do good Works, will not your own Righteousness save you? this I said to prove her, she reply'd our Righteousness is a wicked Righte∣ousness, therefore it cannot save us. She &amp; I speak∣ing some what of the dealings of God, she also said, when I lie a Bed, sometimes I think how Christ dy'd for my Sins, and rose again for my Justification</P>
<P><HI>Octob.</HI> the 8th, at the Meeting, before the oppor∣tunity began, she ask'd me where that Place was, <HI>Let our Hearts answer, Lord, Thy Face will we seek;</HI> the Lord brought it to my Mind.</P>
<P><HI>Octob.</HI> the 12th, she said to her Father, where is that Passage <HI>Fear not little Flock, it is your Father's good Pleasure to give you the Kingdom▪</HI> saying it has been good to me.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="010473_0013_0F7FC38E1FA3EE08"/>
The 14th▪ she ask'd her Father to look her that Place, <HI>Ask, and you shall have, seek and you shall find, knock, and it shall be open'd to you:</HI> These Words have been an Encouragement to my Soul to seek the Lord betimes: Oh! that such an un∣worthy Creature as I should ask and have.</P>
<P>The 15th, being at the Morning Opporunity, when she came home, she said, these Words came into my Mind, <HI>Yea durable Riches and Righteousness;</HI> sometimes I do think upon that word, where Christ says, <HI>I have prayed for thee, that thy Faith fail not.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Octob.</HI> 18th, 1699 As I was putting her to Bed, she said, Oh! when I am converted to God, I shall not be afraid to die, I shall sing with the Angels for evermore.</P>
<P>The 21st, she sitting by her Father, said, 'tis the Blood of Christ that cleanseth from all Sin. Some Hours after she asked her Father where that Passage was, <HI>This is our God, we have waited for him we will joy and rejoice in his Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>In the Evening I ask'd her how she came to ask for such a Scripture? she said the Lord bro't it to her Remembrance. I was reading about the Sins of Israel, where God says▪ <HI>They shall call, but he will not hear:</HI> Oh! said she, what a dreadful Thing is that, God will not hear when they pray.</P>
<P><HI>Nov.</HI> the 2d. I came up into her Chamber, and found her reading Mr. <HI>John Janeway'</HI>s Life and Death; she was all in Tears, she said to me, Oh! that I were such a Worm as this was! that God would give me Repentance unto Life! Oh! that
<PB N="14" REF="010473_0014_0F7FC38E9D38D9A8"/>
I were in the Bosom of Jesus! Oh! that my Sorrow might be true Sorrow!</P>
<P>Another time she said, I have the Righteousness of Christ to wrap me round, I shall be sav'd, I shall appear without spot. This being Sabbath Day, she said, the Lord make me such an one as may taste His Royal Meat; I hope the Lord will Convert me to Himself, and will not let me Perish in the State of Sin and Misery.</P>
<P><HI>Nov.</HI> the 20th, she said to her Father, we must prepare for the Coming of Christ; yes, said her Father, 'tis our Duty: she said so it is, and we, must say as <HI>Ephraim</HI> did, <HI>Turn Thou me, and I shall be turned.</HI></P>
<P>The 22d, she said, I wept this Morning for fear the Lord will cast me into Hell. I said, What dissatisfies you now? what hopes have you that He will not? she said, He has promised me to change my Heart.</P>
<P>Yesterday Morning I went up to her Chamber, she being in Bed, I found her in a great passion of Weeping, having a Book in her Hand; I ask'd her why she wept? She said, it was that God would make her such a one as he was, she had been read∣ing o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, for there is a great deal of need of it. This Morning, as soon as she came down Stairs, she ask'd her Father where that Scripture was, <HI>I will be their God, and they shall be my People,</HI> saying, it was a great Mercy that He will be the God of such unworthy Creatures. This Evening her Father and I speaking of the Temptations of the Children of God; she sitting by, said there are no temptation in Heaven,
<PB N="15" REF="010473_0015_0F7FC38F449C63B0"/>
there is nothing but Joy and praising of God. A few days since, I being gone from Home, she was in a fault, which I was told when I came; I laid the Evil of it before her; she burst out into Tears and earnestly desiring me to forgive her saying, God will forgive me. I heard her saying, <HI>Who shall deliver us from the Body of this Death?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Decemb.</HI> the 3d, I took a Book to read a Ser∣mon, the Text being in <HI>Canticles,</HI> the Words <HI>Draw me, we will run after Thee,</HI> which <HI>Cartaret</HI> took up, saying, it is as much as if he had said, Lord draw us, we will run after Thee; I hope, said she the Lord will draw me, and put me among the number of His chosen Ones, give me a true Heart I ask'd her what Grounds she had to hope that God would do thus for her, seeing it was not every one that He gave Grace unto, is was but a few. Has God at any time given you a Promise that He will do this? She said, Yes He has; that in St. <HI>Luke, I have pray'd for thee, that thy Faith fail not</HI> and I have taken hold of it▪</P>
<P>The 5th in the Evening, having had some Friends at Supper, the Child being gone up, when I came to her, she said, I have a very suit∣able Scripture came to my Mind, <HI>Vanity of Vanities, all is Vanity.</HI> The 6th Day she was say∣ing, God will love me, if I do those things which please Him. I said to her, That God does not love any for what they do, but that it is our Duty to be found doing the Will of God because he has lov'd us. She said, Yes: for we lov'd not him, but, He first lov'd us; methinks that Word

doth. enlighten my Soul, I said, What does it enlighten your Soul into? Said she, into the Know∣ledge of Christ. I said, What Knowledge of Christ? She said, That I might be wholly at the dispose of God.</P>
<P>Last Lords Day, in the Morning, she said, Fa∣ther, is there ever such a place, <HI>Hear and your Souls shall live?</HI> it came but now into my Mind. This Evening she said to me Mother, if we fear the Lord and serve him he will exceedingly multiply us. A little after, she said, Oh! that I may be converted before Christ comes; if I were converted I did not care if I did die.</P>
<P><HI>Decemb.</HI> the 19th, in the Evening, her Father being taken ill, she seem'd much concern'd; and going to him, she said, Oh, my poor Father! the Lord, I hope, will lay no more on you then he will enable you to bear. Her Father saying, That it was his Duty to watch for his Lord's Coming: she presently quoted that place where it is said, <HI>Watch, for ye know not in what Hour the Lord will come.</HI> About the 12th of <HI>January</HI> she being very ill of the Tooth-ach, and some what impatient, I said to her, it was the Lord did afflict, because we did S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>; She said, the Lord has laid all my Sins upon Christ.

This Morning she said, to me, Oh! that God would give me the Knowledge of Christ, I do desire no∣thing else, then should I be willing to die; then you might say in the day of the Lord, <HI>These are the Children which thou hast given me.</HI></P>

I ask'd her whether she would have Him to make her Holy as well as Happy; she said, Yes she would have him upon his own Terms, for it was the best Marriage to be marry'd to Christ: Oh! said she, If I had an Interest in Christ, I should be glad to go to God immediately. And then she kneel'd down, and did earnestly beg that God would reveal Christ to her, using this Expression, <HI>My Soul, wait thou only upon God.</HI></P>
<P>The 21, she said to me, Mother, these Words just now came into my Mind, <HI>If a Child ask his Father Bread, will he give him a Stone; Or if he ask a Fish, will he give him a Serpent.</HI> This Day she came to her Father to look her that Scripture, <HI>Every Plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted out;</HI> Her Father reading that Passage, <HI>Have Salt in your selves,</HI> stopt, &amp; speaking somewhat from it, said, What, is it to have Salt in ourselves? The Child, being by, tho'he had ask'd her the Question, said, it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o have Grace in our Hearts. The 22d she said, I do dream very frightful Dreams, but I will trust in God, and believe in him. This Morning as I was dressing her, she said to me, as soon as I am converted I shall desire to die, and then you'll come to Heaven to me. In Prayer she said, Lord, thou hast bid me ask, and I shall have. Oh! I ask Christ; with many other Expressions, with that, that she might do as that good <HI>Mary</HI> did, which chose that good

Part: She said also to me, Mother, pray for me that I may be Converted, a little after, she said, I long for Christ to love him more, that I may serve him more, that I may serve him better.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> the 1st, Going a Journey, in which we were in great Danger of over-turning the Child was much frighten'd, and said, O Lord! I pray Thee preserve us; Thou canst do it, but, not my Will, but thine be done. Some time after, being past the Danger, she said, this Word just now came into my Mind, <HI>Fear not little Flock, it is your Father's good Pleasure to give you the Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>Yesterday coming home, she told me, as she was thinking of committing her self to the Lord, these Words came into her Mind: <HI>Commit thy Ways to the Lord, and he shall bring it to pass:</HI> And these Words, <HI>Commit thy Ways to the Lord, and he shall give thee the Desire of thy Heart.</HI></P>
<P>A little Kinswoman told, that as they were at Play, they took an occasion to fall out; but in a little time, <HI>Cartaret</HI> recollecting her self, Cousin, don't we know that Christ dy'd for us, why should we fall out.</P>
<P>Another time, being at Dinner, some body found fault with the Bread; she reply'd, <HI>It is writ∣ten Man liveth not by Bread alone, but by every Word that proceedeth out of the Mouth of God.</HI></P>
<P>She being abroad at Dinner, hapen'd to bear one of the Servants take the Lord's Name in vain; Don't ye know <HI>God will not hold him Guiltless that taketh his Name in Vain?</HI> This was I told by the
<PB N="19" REF="010473_0019_0F7FC39303C879B0"/>
Daughter of the House that heard her.</P>
<P>[Being from Home, and not having my Writ∣ing Book, I have let slip many precious Expressions without setting them down.]</P>
<P>About <HI>July</HI> 1700, I being from Home, the Child was taken very Ill, her Aunt put her to Bed, and her Aunt not being very well, the Child said, pray Aunt go to Bed; I am loth to leave you alone, for the Lord is with me, and he is the best Companion. When I came Home, I found the Child very Ill, she said to me, I am Ill, but these Words came into my Mind; <HI>Those that wait upon the Lord shall renew their Strength; They shall mount up with Wings as Eagles; They shall run and not be weary; They shall walk, and not faint:</HI> And these Words led me to the Rock that is higher than I; I ask'd her what that Rock was? She said it is Christ; I de∣sired he would shew memore of my own filthiness,</P>
<P>This Morning, a little after she awoke, she said, I must have Christ, I will Pray my Heart out but I will have Christ, I can't be satisfy'd with∣out I have Christ.</P>
<P>In the Evening she was earnest with Tears that Christ may be reveal'd to her: She said, I must have Christ, I can't tell what to do without him; I ask'd her why she must needs have Christ? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he reply'd, I must, because I must utterly Perish with∣out him. I said, can't your Prayers save you? be∣ing willing to prove her: She said, Oh! no, no∣thing but Christ can do it, my Righteousness is dung. O that my Heart may be affected with what I say: <HI>For with the Heart Man believeth unto Righ∣teousness, and with the Mouth Confession is made unto Salvation.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="010473_0020_0F7FC393826EECC0"/>
Another time, going to her Chair, she sat and went; I ask'd her what she a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'d? says she, I have offended the Lord, and he is dreadful; but I must pray to him to make me his Child, for I can't be so without he makes me so; but he has promis'd those that seek him early shall find him; I must pray to God to teach me to pray, for I have an immortal Soul. A little after, I gave her her Supper, &amp; told her she must crave a Blessing upon her Food, for it was the Lord that gives us that Food; she reply'd, we have more than we de∣serve; for we deserve nothing but Hell. Nei∣ther must I take God's Name in Vain, <HI>for he will not hold him Guiltless that taketh his Name in Vain.</HI> Another time she said, I hope my Sins are pardoned; her Aunt said, we must have Grounds for our Hopes: What Grounds have you to believe your Sins are pardon'd? she reply'd, because Christ dy'd for the worst of Sinners, and I believe he dy'd for me.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> the 10th, <HI>Cartaret</HI> sitting by the Fire, said to me, this Scripture come just now into my Mind, <HI>He that toucheth one of the Lord's People, toucheth the Apple of his Eye.</HI> As she was going to Bed, she said the Devil does sometimes tell me he will appear to me, that makes me so afraid; she said also that I have dream'd that the Devil was pulling me into Hell, but God kept me and held me fast, and would not suffer him to do it.</P>
<P><HI>Novemb.</HI> the 23d, she having been a long time in a dead frame of Spirit, this Evening she seem to have some working of Heart; being a Bed, I bid her seek the Lord; she said she had, and he has
<PB N="21" REF="010473_0021_0F7FC39429047918"/>
heard my Prayer many a time, and answered me: I said, how has he answered you? She said, by this place of Scripture, <HI>I will be thy God;</HI> and I hope God will not take me away before my Work be done: He has also answer'd me in this place, <HI>I will have Mercy on whom I will have Mercy; for a small moment he has forsaken me, but with everlasting Kindness will he gather me.</HI> A little af∣ter, she said, that place hath been very sweet to me, and comes in sometimes when I am at Play; <HI>Riches and Honour are with Me: Yea durable Riches and Righteousness.</HI> Then she was very earnest with me to go to Prayer by her, before she went to sleep.</P>
<P>Another time she said to me, In Heaven there is nothing but Praises, Praises, Praises. She would be sometimes desiring she might not be found without the Wedding Garment, which is the Righ∣teousness of Christ.</P>
<P>A little before she was took sick, she would, speak of that Scripture in <HI>Job, He hath found a Ransom.</HI> A few days before her Illness, she said to me, This Scripture is come to my Mind, <HI>He will have Mercy on whom he will have Mercy,</HI> and he will have Mercy on me.</P>
<P>The Day she was took sick, which was the first of <HI>December.</HI> 1701, she rehears'd the sameplace, and said, He has had Mercy upon me; she spoke little all her Sickness for she seem'd to have her Spirits much seiz'd.</P>
<P>The Sabbath day Evening, she said to me, Mo∣ther, I hope the Lord will restore me to do that Work He has for me to do; for he who has be∣gan
<PB N="22" REF="010473_0022_0F7FC395D39A5368"/>
will perfect it; these Words are come upon my Mind. <HI>He that gather'd much, had none over; and he that gather'd little, had no lack.</HI> Her mentio∣ning that Scripture, has, and does give me such Satisfaction; for I have been made to see that tho' she had liv'd to gather little Grace, yet she should stand as compleat in the perfect Righteousness of Christ, as if she had liv'd many Years to bring Glory to God. From this time to <HI>Thursday</HI> follow∣ing, on which she dy'd, she spoke little, but slept much, till the <HI>Wednesday</HI> Night: she grew very restless, the <HI>Thursday</HI> worse; it was the fourth Day that she had been blind; call'd to me, and said, I do begin to see now. Her Eyes being fast, I said to her, What, is it with the Eyes of your Mind? She reply'd, Yes it is▪ I said, What do you see? She answer'd, I see Christ hanging upon the Tree: Something she said softly, her Spirits be∣ing spent. A little after I said to her, Does God lift up the Light of his Countenance upon your Soul? She said, I hope he doth. I ask'd her. Are you willing to go to Christ? She answer'd, I hope I am. The Agonies of Death being upon her, the last sensible Word she spoke to me, was, <HI>Pray for me;</HI> desiring also her Father to pray for her, and then had some Flashings of Lightness as she grew weaker. She lay very still all the while her Father pray'd by her, and about Eleven a-Clock she fell fast asleep, the 7th of <HI>December</HI> 1701, aged six Years; 11 Months, and 3 Day.</P>
