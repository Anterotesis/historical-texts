<HEAD>A DISCOURSE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>II. CHRONICLES vii.1.</HI></BIBL>
<P>—Now when Solomon had made an end of pray∣ing, the fire came down from Heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifice, and the glory of the Lord filled the House.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>UNDER the Mosaic Dispensation, of∣ferings were made use of as a principal part of the public worship of God by the Jewish Church: these were of two kinds, Gifts and Sacrifices, wherein the life of the creature offered was taken away. The de∣sign was to make an atonement for their sins, to express their gratitude to God for mercies received, and to procure new favors from his hand.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY after the sail the Lord instruct∣ed Adam to offer sacrifice, Gen. iii.21. When Abel was grown up, he offered the best of his flock in sacri∣fice to God, Gen. iv.4, 10. When Noah went forth from the ark, he offered an acceptable sacrifice, Gen. viii.20. At different places and upon different occa∣sions, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, offered sacrifices to
<PB N="4" REF="031840_0003_0FEECF471187FDC8"/>
the Lord by his command. From these injunctions to the Patriarchs, the custom of offering sacrifice spread through the world—these sacrifices, when offered in faith in reference to the Messiah, as the Lamb which was to be slain to take away sin, were consumed upon the altar by fire from Heaven, as a mark of divine approbation.</P>
<P>THEY were distinguished by various appellati∣ons: such as Burnt-offerings, Peace offerings, Sin-of∣ferings, Trespass offerings, Meat-offerings, and Drink-offerings, together with various other kinds.</P>
<P>THE Offerings made use of by Solomon at the dedication of the Temple, were Burnt offerings and Peace-offerings: upon which occasion he offered twenty-two thousand Oxen, and an hundred and twen∣ty thousand Sheep. When the beasts to be offered were prepared and laid upon the Altar, and when the Congregation and Elders of Israel were assembled, to∣gether with the Priests, the Levites, the Singers and play∣ers upon instruments, the Lord gave them a token of his presence, and that he meant to favor their design and bless the Congregation, by filling the house with a thick cloud. Solomon laid hold on the opportunity, and with the most profound reverence and solemnity, dedicated the house by prayer and supplication, invi∣ting the Almighty to make it the temple of his abode; the substance of which prayer we have in the 6th Chap∣ter
<PB N="5" REF="031840_0004_0FEECF4896339FD0"/>
of this Book. The Historian informs us that when Solomon had made an end of praying (as a mark of divine approbation) fire came down from Heaven and consumed the Burnt-offering and the Sacrifices, and that the glory of the Lord filled the House.</P>
<P>DID not this strikingly represent the Lord Jesus Christ, who offered himself a sacrifice for sin, who alone builds the Spiritual Temple, the Church; who takes poor sinners out of the ruins of fallen nature, forms them by his word and spirit, and makes them lively stones in the Spiritual building, to offer spiritual Sacri∣fice, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ; who conse∣crates the Church by his matchless offering and all pre∣valent intercession; and who, by the fire of his love, fills the hearts of his people with his glory, and con∣sumes the power of their sins and corruptions. It also reminds us of the obligations we are under to dedicate this House, which has been erected under the care of a kind and indulgent Providence to the Lord, for his worship and service. I shall therefore,</P>
<P N="1">I. CONSIDER the qualifications necessary for dedicating a House to the Lord, with any prospect of success.</P>
<P N="2">II. SHEW in what manner we should proceed in dedicating this House to the Lord, or what kind of sacrifices we should offer which will be acceptable.</P>
<P N="3">III. POINT out the tokens of our sacrifices being
<PB N="6" REF="031840_0005_0FEECF4A1BC9EFF8"/>
acceptable to God.
<Q>The fire came down from Hea∣ven and consumed the Burnt-offering and the sacri∣fices: and the glory of the Lord filled the House.</Q></P>
<P>THE first things which now demand our attention are the qualifications necessary for dedicating a House to the Lord with any prospect of success.</P>
<P>TO avoid the charge of hypocrisy brought a∣gainst Israel—
<Q>This People draweth nigh to me with their mouth, and honor me with their lips, but their heart is far from me,</Q>
we should seriously enquire whether we have made a cheerful dedication of our∣selves to the Lord. In vain do we engage in the so∣lemnities of this day unless our hearts have been cir∣cumcised to love the Lord our God with all our hearts, Deut. xxx.6.</P>
<P>UNLESS we have been humbled for our mani∣fold sins, and been divinely constrained to seek refuge in the atoning blood of justifying righteousness of the great Redeemer of Mankind, who offered himself a sacrifice for sin; unless we have received him as our Prophet, Priest and King, by faith, with thanksgiving, and given ourselves up to him, to be ruled by his laws, led by his Spirit, and to yield obedience to his com∣mands; unless he has been made to us wisdom, righte∣ousness, sanctification and redemption, how can we set this House apart for his worship with any prospect of success unless we are made spiritual, and worship him
<PB N="7" REF="031840_0006_0FEECF4B9F9DFA98"/>
in spirit and in truth; "<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r," says an inspired writer,
<Q>We are the circumcision who worship God in the spirit, rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh.</Q>
Phil. iii.3.</P>
<P>THIS act of dedicating ourselves must always precede every outward form of worship similar to this, agreeable to the language of the Prophet, Isaiah xliv. 5.
<Q>One shall say, I am the Lords: and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob: and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the Lord, and sir∣name himself by the name of Israel.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> WE should be well acquainted with the nature of that worship which the Lord requires to be performed in his House, and only which can be accep∣table to him—not the dry systematical form of words, however beautifully arranged, and pleasing to the ear, can afford him entertainment, nor be considered a suf∣ficient substitute for the sincere devotion of the heart. In vain did the proud boasting Pharisee enter the Temple with uplifted eyes and hands: in vain did he in a lofty tone address the Almighty, saying,
<Q>God, I thank thee I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this Publican. I fast twice in the week, I give tythes of all that I possess. While the Publican standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto Heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me, a sinner. This man went down to his house justified;</Q>
that is,
<PB N="8" REF="031840_0007_0FEECF548BDE3540"/>
he possessed peace of conscience, which was to him an evidence that his sins were pardoned, and his prayer was accepted.—As no goodness or moral virtues of ours will merit the favor of the Almighty, so neither will any sin or multitude of offences exclude a peni∣tent sinner the benefit of his mercy. The great Pa∣rent of Mankind and object of religious worship, re∣quires the engagements of our hearts when we ap∣proach him—"My Son, says he, give me thy heart."— When David was instructed to seek the Lord, he repli∣ed, "My heart said, Lord, thy face will I seek." Psalm xxvii.8.
<Q>It is with the heart man believeth unto righteousness, then with the mouth confession will be made unto salvation.</Q>
Rom. x.10. Every branch of our worship must correspond with the instructions of God's word, both as to doctrine and experience. If these will not bear examination by this infallible rule,
<Q>We do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the pow∣er of God.</Q>
Mat. xxii.29.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> A PROPER attention should be paid to the object we have in view, and the motives by which we are influenced in the act of dedicating this House to the Lord. What is the object? Is it popular ap∣plause? Is it a mere conformity to the custom of the day in which we live? Is it to gratify a spirit of ambi∣tion, and to become respectable as partisans of a sepa∣rate and distinct Society? In short, whatever it is, if it is not the glory of the divine Three, Father, Son and
<PB N="9" REF="031840_0008_0FEECF56109F37F0"/>
Holy Ghost, in the dispensation of the Gospel, the con∣version of sinners, and the consolation and edification of the People of God, yea, all that is comprehended in the word salvation, we cannot expect it will prosper, but come to nought, and in that case, the sooner the better.</P>
<P>THE second thing to be considered is the man∣ner in which we should proceed in dedicating a House to the Lord, or what kind of sacrifices we should offer, which will be acceptable. Since it is not by the blood of Bulls and of Goats, and the ashes of an Heifer, not by offering thousands of Rams, and ten thousands of rivers of oil, nor by our prayers, our tears, or mere ex∣ternal acts of devotion, that sin can be removed from the heart, or the guilt of it from the conscience, but by the blood of Christ our Passover, who was sacrificed for us.
<Q>Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</Q>
Let us follow him in his victories and triumphs, and gather up the spoils.</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> WE should attend to his worship with rev∣rence—reverence becomes the sanctuary, becomes ev∣ery worshiper and is due to the object of worship: for,
<Q>the Lord is greatly to be feared in the assembly of his saints, and to be had in reverence by those who draw nigh unto him. We are to serve him with fear, and rejoice with trembling: for he is glorious in ho∣liness, fearful in praises, doing wonders.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="031840_0009_0FEECF5794896E58"/><HI>Secondly.</HI> WE should come bowing at the foot∣stool of his mercy, as poor, having nothing but sin, and guilty, deserving nothing but misery: conscious that we have no might to free our souls from the bondage of the law, or break the chains of unbelief; dependant wholly on the riches of mercy and grace, through Je∣sus Christ, we should cry, "Lord, save, or we perish." This is an acceptable sacrifice, for the sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise. Ps. li.17.
<Q>To this man he will look, and with such he will dwell, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the hearts of the contrite ones.</Q>
Isa. lvii.15. These are the blessed described in Matt. v.3, 4, 6, and to them the promises belong.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> As a humble frame of mind is the mark of a true penitent, so by prayer and supplication, we should make known our requests to God, resting upon the promise of salvation, and wrestling, as Jacob did with the Angel, when he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me; such will assuredly prevail and get that new name, the name of Israel. Gen. xxxii.28. We should pray for the light of his countenance, and teachings of his spirit, that his grand purposes and designs in the covenant of grace may be more unfold∣ed, the mystery of redeeming love explained, and that the unsearchable riches of Christ may be brought to view, that thousands may be effectually called to the
<PB N="11" REF="031840_0010_0FEECF59184AD388"/>
knowledge and enjoyment of the truth within these walls—we should pray that he might abundantly bless the provision of his House, and satisfy Zions poor with bread: that he might clothe his Priests with sal∣vation, and cause his saints to shout aloud for joy: that he might teach his Ministers hands to war and their fin∣gers to fight against sin and error; that he might pour out his holy spirit upon all his people, and dwell in this sanctuary, and in the heart of every worshipper: that he might cause his goodness to pass before us, and fill the House with his glory. We should pray for our en∣emies, persecutors and slanderers, that their hearts may be changed, and they saved in the Lord, with an ever∣lasting salvation.</P>
<P>THIS is another acceptable sacrifice to him who hath said, "In all places where I record my name, I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee." Exodus xx.24.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Gratitude of heart, and a public ac∣knowledgement of his goodness and mercy, is another sacrifice acceptable to the Lord. As a warning to us, and to mark the ingratitude of Hezekiah, who had re∣ceived so many and such great favors at the Lord's hand, it is recorded, 2 Chron. xxxii.25.
<Q>But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done un∣to him;</Q>
When the ten Lepers were cleansed by our Lord, and only one turned back to glorify God, he noticed their ingratitude by saying.
<Q>Were there not
<PB N="12" REF="031840_0011_0FEECF61B3E71818"/>
ten cleansed, but where are the nine?</Q>
Luke xvii.17. In addition to the innumerable benefits we have received from the Lord, both temporal and spiritual, we should not be unmindful of these: that our eyes have seen his salvation; that our ears have heard and con∣tinue to hear the joyful sound of the Gospel; that our feet have been directed into the paths of righteousness, so that we can feed upon the word of truth, and that now, under the direction of his kind Providence, this House has been raised, without any material injury to any concerned therein, and under the sanction of good and wholesome laws we are formed into a society, and regularly incorporated, so that we can sit under our own vine and fig-tree, and worship God agreeable to the dictates of our consciences. Our sacrifices should continually be offered upon that altar which sanctifieth the gift and the giver, even Jesus, who is our sacrifice, our Priest, and through whom only we can approach the Father. His invitation and promise are the foun∣dation for our confidence, that whatsoever we ask we shall receive—his honor is engaged to make good the promises, and his praise is promoted by our reliance thereon; so that his glory is inseparably connected with the salvation of those who believe.</P>
<P>THIRDLY I shall point out the tokens of our sa∣crifices being acceptable to the Lord.
<Q>The fire came down from Heaven and consumed the burnt-offer∣ing and the sacrifices, and the glory of the Lord filled the House.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="031840_0012_0FEECF635E953170"/><HI>First.</HI> IN the days of old the Lord manifested his approbation in consuming the sacrifice by fire from Heaven. When, by divine appointment Moses had a∣nointed Aaron and his sons to the office of the Priest∣hood, and Aaron had brought his sin-offering, burnt-offering and peace-offering to the altar, fire came down from Heaven and consumed the sacrifices, Lev· ix.24. as a token of his divine approbation. When the Israelites were defeated in battle by the Midianites, Gideon prayed, and offered a Kid and unleavened bread: in answer to his prayer and to honor the gift he has offered, fire rose up out of the rock, and consu∣med the flesh, and the unleavened bread, and Israel prevailed against Midian. Judges vi.21. When Da∣vid had displeased the Lord by numbering the people, seventy thousand Israelites were slain by pestilence; he then built an altar and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and called upon the Lord, and he answered him from Heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt-offerings. 1 Chron. 21, 26. To reprove the Idoli∣trous worshippers of Baal, and to expose the false pro∣phets who had deluded them, Elijah built an altar, and offered a burnt-sacrifice, while the false prophets cried in vain to their Idol, the fire came down and consumed Elijahs sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench. 1 Kings xviii.38. No sooner had Solomon made an end of praying before the whole congregation of Israel, at
<PB N="14" REF="031840_0013_0FEECF64E51C1770"/>
the dedication of the Temple, but fire came down from Heaven and consumed the burnt-offering and the sacri∣fices, as a token of divine approbation.</P>
<P>THE consuming these offerings, was typical of the attention the Lord pays to the prayers of his peo∣ple, and the honor he confers upon those who put their trust in him; he hearkens to the voice of their suppli∣cations, he hears their cry, and saves them out of all their troubles:—There is also a book of remembrance before him, which contains every request, however imperfectly made, if they are the requests of the soul, and which, in his own time, and in his own way, will fully be answered. Mal. iii.16. The greatest desires of a soul under the teachings of the spirit, are to have the mind preserved from guilt, and the heart from the power and pollution of sin, that they may continually be enabled to say,
<Q>Whom have we in Heaven but thee, and there is none upon earth that we desire be∣sides thee.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN the mysteries of Redeeming Love, mani∣fested in the covenant of grace, in the unspeakable gift of Jesus Christ, and in our effectual calling by the spi∣rit, whose favors are without repentance, when these, I say, are explained and accompanied with an almighty and irresistible power to the soul, fear and sorrow vanish, joy and peace succeed, and the holy fire of di∣vine love warms the heart with inexpressible delight, and consumes the power of our beastly lusts and cor∣ruptions.
<PB N="15" REF="031840_0014_0FEECF6669C5D518"/>
When Jesus opened the understandings of the two disciples, in their journey from Jerusalem to Emmaus, they were constrained to acknowledge that their hearts burned within them. Luke xxiv.32.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> When Moses was upon the Mount talking with God, he said, "shew me thy glory!" The Lord answered him,
<Q>Thou canst not see my face, for no man can see my face and live, but I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and he proclaimed the name of the Lord, the Lord merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth.</Q>
Exod. xxxiii.18, 20. xxxiv.6. The glory of God which filled the Temple when Solomon had made an end of praying was the cloud and a visible brightness, like that of the Sun when covered with a thick cloud, though it cannot be seen in its splendor and glory, yet its brightness will be visible in a certain degree, and the beholder will be satisfied that it is not removed, but veiled by the cloud, and that only for a short period, when its power and influence will return. Incomparably more easy would it be to behold the Sun, with the naked eye, in his brightness and glory, without an interposing veil, than in our mortal and imperfect state, to see the Almighty face to face. He is to be seen and known only through the veil of Christ's human nature,
<Q>For God is in Christ reconciling the world unto himself. In Christ dwells all the fulness of the godhead bodily,</Q>
and he is the
<Q>brightness of the Father's glory, and the
<PB N="16" REF="031840_0015_0FEECF6E8A27F5D8"/>
express image of his person.</Q>
The glory which filled the Temple, produced a reverential awe of God's holi∣ness, wisdom, power, love and faithfulness, and influen∣ced them to worship him with suitable affections.</P>
<P>THEY were sensible he was present, though they could not see him with their bodily eyes. So now in the act of religious worship, the token we should look for, and are encouraged to expect, of the presence and approbation of the Lord, is that glory which will fill the House and the heart of every spiritual worshiper; if we have such views of his holiness as to say with Job. chap. xlii.5, 6.
<Q>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee, wherefore, I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.</Q>
Such views of his wisdom in the whole oeconomy of redemption, as to admire and fall in with his method of salvation; such views of his power as to fear offending him, and put our whole trust and confidence in him; such views of his love; as to feel our souls animated in his service, and such views of his faithfulness, as to rejoice, with joy unspeakable, and full of glory. Then how precious will the gospel be to us, we shall bind it as chains of gold about our necks. We shall then behold the beauty of their feet who bring glad tidings of salvation; then how delightful to be engaged in preaching, and profita∣ble in hearing of the unsearchable riches of Christ, that in such circumstances we may say with the singer in Is∣rael
<PB N="17" REF="031840_0016_0FEECF3C8DA79EE8"/>
"Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God." As the fountain of light, his rays penetrate the mind which was shut up in darkness—Though faint when it rises, it shines brighter and brighter to the per∣fect day; so does the divine glory upon the soul blessed with its quickening, illuminating, cheering and fructi∣fying influences; so powerful that its glory is reflected in their profession and conduct; and when the veil of mortality and human imperfection is removed, they will shine as the brightness of the firmament, and as the stars forever and ever;—then they will see eye to eye and face to face, lost in wonder, love and praise.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude this discourse with an inquiry, and a few observations.</P>
<P>HAS this great change passed upon us? Have we been constrained to dedicate ourselves to God? If not, we have cause to tremble, considering what we are this morning engaged in. As the Lord cannot be de∣ceived, so neither will he be mocked. May he who commanded light to shine out of darkness, shine forth, through the preaching the gospel of his Son, in his glo∣rious power, that those who are dead in tresspasses and sins, may hear his voice and live; that those who sit in darkness may see a great light; that the glory of our Immanual, as God Man Mediator, may influence them to a cheerful dedication of body, soul and spirit to the Lord; considering they are not their own, but are bought with the price of the Redeemer's blood. May
<PB N="18" REF="031840_0017_0FEECF71937260D8"/>
every Believer this morning renew the act of dedicat∣ing himself to the Lord. Whenever we enter this sanc∣tuary, may the fire of divine love come down and warm our hearts, and consume the power of all our corrup∣tions; and may the glory of the Lord fill this house in the power of the gospel, and the sweet enjoyment of his presence.</P>
<P>SOONER than this pulpit should be polluted with error, or the worship carried on in this place, have for its motto, <HI>Ichabod,</HI> "the glory is departed"—yea, sooner than these walls should afford protection to a licentious Minister, or a congregation debauched in their princi∣ples and corrupt in their worship, may the whole fabric be levelled with the ground, or become the habitation of Owls, and the haunt of wild Beasts.</P>
<P>MAY the Elders, Deacons, Church members, and every stated and occasional worshiper in this place▪ u∣nite in praying for the peace of our Zion, and in cele∣brating the praises of God. As, the foundation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THE Corner-stone was laid May 16, 1796, and the frame of the building was raised the 2nd of June following.</NOTE> of this House was laid with prayer, and now it is so far com∣pleated as to afford comfortable accommodations, may the praises of our God resound through the whole assem∣bly, and may every heart join in shouting
<Q>Grace, grace unto it.</Q></P>
