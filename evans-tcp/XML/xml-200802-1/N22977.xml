<STAGE>SIR JOHN <HI>discovered at a table, musing.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>A scholar, a philosopher, to change his peaceful hours, his nights of study, and his days of fame!— And for what?—A wife!—A wife without a fortune too!—Where was my wisdom?—But young and handsome!—Where was my philosophy?—Where my pride, to do an act at which I blush?— <STAGE>[<HI>After sighing heavily, and shewing evident signs of uneasiness, he takes a book and begins to read</HI>—Dorimant <HI>enters un∣perceived by</HI> sir John, <HI>and seats himself at the table.</HI>]</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[Laying down the book.]</STAGE> Ah! Dorimant, my friend, it is you I have to blame—You were the cause of my marriage—you painted wedlock with an eloquence that deluded me—Pictured my wife as soft, complying—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorimant.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is not she?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[Starting.]</STAGE> You there!—Why do you <HI>steal</HI> upon me thus?</P>
<STAGE>[Angrily.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorimant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Steal upon you!—Were you not talking to me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>No.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="030339_0004_0FE5C543AA2AE048"/>
<SPEAKER>Dorimant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you were guilty of very ungentel∣manly-like behaviour, to abuse me when you did not know I was present to defend myself. And suppose I advised you to marry; did not you ask my advice?— Were you not charmed when I gave my advice?—Be∣sides, is it possible you can repent?—With what on earth have you to reproach your wife?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her indiscretion—which keeps me in perpetual torture.—She knows how much I feel on the occasion, and how earnestly I have entreated our mar∣riage might be kept secret; and yet it is her first pleasure the world should know she has a husband—and that I am the unfortunate man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorimant.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can easily imagine your desire has not been strictly complied with—but you could not, surely, think to be married half your life without having it sometime or other known in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>A secret alliance, formed near two years ago, without my father's consent or knowledge, would expose me to his just resentment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorimant.</SPEAKER>
<P>His resentment will be easily overcome —for his obligations to you are so great—his affection for you so tender—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I fear his sorrow, much more than his anger.—But there is another reason.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorimant.</SPEAKER>
<P>That, indeed, has some weight; for you mean your uncle, the old rich contractor, whose obsti∣nacy and inhumanity, if he knew you had married a lady with a fortune unequal to that he means to give you, might cause him never perhaps to give you a shilling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, beside these, I have another reason yet; one, which (to my own feelings) is of more consequence than any.—You know I have always made a jest of matrimony, laughed at, and ridiculed all husbands; I am therefore now ashamed, and blush at the title—There is something in marriage that takes from the dignity—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorimant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will it take from the dignity of knight∣hood, which you have gained by your learned disserta∣tions?
<PB N="5" REF="030339_0005_0FE5C5805F33A7D8"/>No; nor can there be any reason but your uncle's displeasure why it should be any longer con∣cealed. Certainly you must pay some attention to that; and it ought to be a weighty consideration with your lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it is, I dare say—but the pleasure of telling a secret weighs heavier far.—After all, she is not the only one who takes pleasure in propagating the news—her sister, to whom you design yourself the <HI>happy husband,</HI> has whispered the secret to most of her acquaintance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorimant.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am vext at such indiscretion, and will go to both ladies instantly with my complaint— <STAGE>[Going, returns.]</STAGE> And now do you apply yourself to study— and employ all your knowledge to obtain that degree of patience requisite to your state.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you furnish yourself with ample store against you marry my sister-in-law; for, by Hea∣ven, you will want it all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorimant.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know Emily well—know all her faults —But love them all—even that pride which disdains me I approve; for while my unfortunate quarrel con∣ceals from her my real name and family, she is right in treating me so lightly.—Yet that she loves me, I am convinced; and, the moment my antagonist is pro∣nounced out of danger, I will silence every scruple, by revealing to her, that, instead of poor Dorimant, who has no other friend upon earth but you, I have a for∣tune and family as much above hers, as she now believes hers is above mine.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I long to see you a husband—How mischievous does ill luck make a man! I have not one acquaintance at this moment that I do not wish to see married!</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[Starting up.]</STAGE> Silence!—I thought, mrs. Lucy, I had a hundred times forbidden you to make use of that name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, sir—but when one forgets, I can't see what harm it can do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know you were amongst the few who were entrusted with the secret of our marriage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I have kept it a secret these two years! —Two years is a long time to hold one's tongue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>But do you know what I may forfeit by your indiscretion—the wealth of which the displeasure of my uncle may deprive me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought philosophers despised all such dirty dross as gold.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, mrs. Lucy, although I may be of that opinion, perhaps my children may not, and I may one day be reproached for neglecting their fortunes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, sir, your children are yet to come, and a philosopher's talent is to reform the world, but very seldom to people it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Entrusting you with a secret, mrs. Lucy, has given you a freedom that may very soon lose you your place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, sir! I am sure you know better than to turn a servant away, whom you have been obliged to trust with a secret.—There are many better ways to keep a servant silent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>And this I suppose is one?</P>
<STAGE>[Gives her money.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, sir—and now I'll be silent for a month —and if you repeat this, at the end of that month, I'll be silent for the next—and so on. But, sir, I had al∣most forgot my errand—her ladyship—no—my mistress —not her ladyship—not your wife—but my mistress— sent me to ask if you will permit her to wait upon you here—as she has something particular to speak to you about.—Oh! she is here, sir.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have I not desired you a thousand times, madam, not to follow me here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I have as many times obeyed you—but at present I want to speak to you on a subject of so much importance, to us both, that I have ventured to disobey your commands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>"Commands!"—You talk to me as if I were your tyrant.—I have but one command—Keep our marriage secret.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>To keep it an entire secret is impossible; our living so long together, in the same house, though on a pretended visit to the mistress of it, is enough to create suspicion—The world has curiosity, and penetration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>And has no longer any doubt but we are man and wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!—Do they really think so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes—and I fear, say so too.—Why these expressions of joy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>To have you for a husband is a happiness so flattering—a felicity of which I feel myself so proud— that to have it known, would give me infinite delight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>In contradiction to my will?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>—Perhaps the desire is wrong—but if it be my fault (I must own) it would constitute my greatest happiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>A woman's eloquence is irresistible. <STAGE>[A∣side.]</STAGE> But did not you promise me that your sister and your woman should be the only persons to whom you would confide this secret?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you should accuse my sister, not me—It is she who has forfeited her word, not I.—I have kept mine but too well. Yet though by the concealment my reputation may be wounded, I submit without com∣plaint—But, if I make this sacrifice to you, suffer me to demand a small one in return.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>That lord Lovemore, either by you or by me, may be made acquainted with our marriage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="030339_0008_0FE5C54C9C2B22C8"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>The very person of all the world I would most conceal it from; for to him more frequently than to any other person, have I declared my sentiments of the marriage state; and in what a despicable light, to him, must my inconsistency appear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—notwithstanding you are married, nei∣ther his lordship, nor any other person, most intimately acquainted with your former sentiments, can accuse you of inconsistency.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did I not rail at marriage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you not now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>But had I not an utter aversion to it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>And have you not now?</P>
<STAGE>[Weeping.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why should you be uneasy at that? I love you—and should like you better, if you were any thing but my wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>And being my husband, I love you far better than if you were any thing on earth beside.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will not have our marriage declared to any one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes! to lord Lovemore—you must consent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>From what motive?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Excuse me—but be assured it is indispensible; and why have you such a particular apprehension of him; for although this lord is a fine gentleman, and in high esteem with the gay world, yet I have fre∣quently heard you speak but slightly of his understand∣ing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Therefore I fear him—you know I always fear a fool—It is the fool, who laughs at the faults of wise men, because they are so unlike his own. 'Tis the fool who traduces their character—'Tis the fool who stops at no means to accomplish his evil wishes. —Fools dress to seduce women; lisp, chat, flutter, and even <HI>lie</HI> to win them.—'Tis fools, with whom men of sense cannot submit to quarrel, but must fall, like a poor female, by their slander.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then this fool, in one respect, has shewn himself like you; for he never pays a visit to this house, that he does not immediately come to my apartments to
<PB N="9" REF="030339_0009_0FE5C54F80281D88"/>make the same declarations of love, and the same offer of his hand and heart, you once did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[Starting.]</STAGE> To you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>To me.—I once thought to keep it a secret. —But—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>But that was impossible?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes—for the increasing ardour of his ad∣dresses makes it impossible to submit to the painful situ∣ation any longer—and surely there is no method so ef∣fectually and so delicately to put an end to his pursuit, as to declare I am your wife. <STAGE>[Sir John starts.]</STAGE> At present I will not urge you for a decisive answer—but leave you to reflect upon it.</P>
<STAGE>[Bows, with a tender humility, and retires.]</STAGE>
</SP>
<STAGE>[He sits down to write as before, then starts from his seat and throws the book down in a passion.]</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—all my study is at an end for this day—my mind wholly dissipated with domestic con∣cerns—It is impossible for a married man to be a philo∣sopher—and yet it is a state that requires more philoso∣phy than any other.</P>

</SP>
<SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I cannot help thinking he loves her still.</P>
</SP>

<P>As much as a beau, who loves nothing so

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you suppose he will love her the less for that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>His love being but a mere compound of vanity and gallantry, I should suppose not—but at least the news will mortify his pride—And why should not other people meet with mortifications, as well as I, Lucy?</P>
</SP>

<P>If I could please them I should be equally content—but as in that my endeavours are mostly re∣jected, the only alternative I have to preserve me from idleness is to be mischievous.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, madam, do not say you please no one; consider mr. Dorimant.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>And him I have no desire to please; for it is to my disadvantage we should be charmed with each other.—This is the hour he generally calls—Now, Lucy, do something to put me out of humour, that I may break with him at once—Come, talk on some subject to vex me—speak of my sister.</P>

<P>Before his marriage there might be, be∣cause the ladies all imagined he would be a difficult conquest—But after being so easily caught, I don't think there is a woman in the world would be at the trouble of conquering him a second time.</P>

<P>What?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>

<P>They are <STAGE>[hesitating]</STAGE>—sisters.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Tradewell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[Hesitating.]</STAGE> From the country—and as they are going into the country again—I was taking my leave of them—as you saw.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Tradewell.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what brought them here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>A mere accident.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Tradewell.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't like accidents, when women are in the ease—They are the cause of many unlucky
<PB N="15" REF="030339_0015_0FE5C55FE1561E60"/>accidents—and I would have nothing impede the busi∣ness upon which I came to speak to you.—I have pro∣cured you a wife—I know you have pretended an aver∣sion to matrimony—but that was merely to some of its forms, and in this case something more substantial is to be attended to; the lady I have chosen is young, hand∣some, and, above all, very rich; and some family rea∣sons will make it necessary the marriage should take place within a few days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Destruction <STAGE>[Aside]</STAGE>—But who is the la∣dy, sir?—Perhaps—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Tradewell.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no perhaps—for she is my daughter-in-law—my wife's only child—and with a fortune—You don't seem pleased—Let me tell you, the lady must not be despised.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Despised, sir!—No, no—but—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Tradewell.</SPEAKER>
<P>No buts, sir—You have written against matrimony to make your book sell—So far you did right—I would write against it myself if I could get any thing by it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Tradewell.</SPEAKER>
<P>My pockets are filled with parch∣ments—follow me into your library, there we will look them over, and take care there's no cheating, unless it should be on our side—follow me, for I am growing old, and not so expert at those things as I used to be.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear sir John, I excuse you most wil∣lingly, for I know how much depends upon your pleas∣ing the old contractor, and how difficult it is to please him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>And in one thing he has just proposed, I fear it will prove impossible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has chosen me a wife, and wants me to marry immediately.</P>

<P>How?</P>
<STAGE>[Starting.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>You</HI> marry—<HI>you</HI>—ha, ha, ha, ha—does he know your resolution?—does he know that you would not marry the finest woman in the world?— <STAGE>[Sir John shews evident signs of uneasiness.]</STAGE>—to marry would make you the laughing-stock of the whole town—You, that have laughed at every married man!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—but I think I <HI>pity</HI> them more than I did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>And does your old uncle imagine he can pre∣vail upon you to quit a bachelor's life?—impossible— and yet, would you believe it, there are some people in this town credulous enough to report you <HI>are</HI> married —but I take care to vindicate your character,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank you—I am very much obliged to you.</P>
<STAGE>[Confused.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, sir John, I never will stand silently by, and hear your firmness of temper called in question— the lady <STAGE>[bowing to <HI>lady C.</HI>]</STAGE> I tell them, may have charms to captivate the coldest heart, yet between her and sir John, I am positive no other than a sincere
<PB N="18" REF="030339_0018_0FE5C574AE5B2830"/>friendship subsists; for he himself has told me so a hun∣dred times.</P>

<P>I suppose I have—to be sure—you are quite right.</P>
<STAGE>[<HI>He makes signs to</HI> lady C. <HI>who appears anxious to speak, to be silent.</HI>]</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>And now, my dear sir John, as I know you to be not only her friend, but mine, permit me to re∣peat, in your presence, what in private I have a thou∣sand times uttered.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>And as a friend to us both, exert your friend∣ship for both our happiness—for if my esteem, my love, my adoration of you, beautiful Matilda— <STAGE>[seizing her hand.</STAGE></P>

<P>Rise, my lord, or I instantly quit the place. — <STAGE>[Aside to <HI>sir John.</HI>]</STAGE> Can you see this unmoved?</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be quiet.</P>

<STAGE>[Endea∣vouring to part them.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then why do you touch it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can, with the coldness of a philosopher.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>And would I could—would I were in your situation.</P>
<STAGE>[Sighing.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>And would I were in your's.</P>
<STAGE>[Sighing.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mean—I mean, my lord, that I per∣ceive your passion is a very serious one; and yet it is my advice you do not give way to it—do not, for <HI>my
<PB N="19" REF="030339_0019_0FE5C561FA3F3588"/>sake</HI>—you know my friendship for you, and how sorry I should be to see you bound by those ties from which only death can release.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! your old fashioned opinion of matrimony I begin to despise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I have lately conceived a worse opi∣nion of it than ever—besides, while she persists in re∣jecting your passion, you ought to submit; unless, in any of your former interviews, she has encouraged your hopes—and in that case—</P>
<STAGE>[with suspicion.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I appeal to his lordship's own honour—If I have, sir, explain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, come, my lord, explain—and I will be judge between you.—What hopes has she ever given you?—I don't mean merely in promise, but in manners, looks, sighs, tears, sadness, joy, or sorrow?—Come, be particular, or you take from me the power of deci∣sion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, to be particular—the first time I disclosed my passion to her, she burst into a fit of laugh∣ter—the second time, she insisted on my leaving the room.—But the third time she received me with every mark of kindness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well!</P>
<STAGE>[Uneasy.</STAGE>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well!</P>
<STAGE>[More angry.</STAGE>

<P>I have, said she, a sister, far more beautiful and amiable than myself, to whom I request you will transfer your affection.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well! <STAGE>[pleased]</STAGE>—and why do you not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! transfer my affection!—never—no— though she try'd to make me jealous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did she—of whom?</P>
<STAGE>[Alarmed.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I can't tell—but the ungrateful woman swore her heart was engaged, and that nothing could eradicate the fixed and tender affection rooted there for another.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>And can you persist after this, my lord? —<HI>for my sake</HI> don't.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>A passion like mine, makes the heart rebel∣lious—it will love on—it will hope, in spite of the rules cold reason dictates.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know my uncle is impatient for my re∣turn, and therefore I cannot remain any longer here— but I am sorry to leave you—very sorry to leave you in this situation, indeed, my lord—Now promise to get the better of your pas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on—it will make me much hap∣pier if you will.</P>

<P>I am going—I must go, or he'll never pardon it— <STAGE>[aside.]</STAGE>—Adieu, my lord, for the present, and think on my advice— <STAGE>[Aside, going reluctantly, and turning back to observe.]</STAGE> This is the first trial of phi∣losophy.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>By heaven, I begin to suspect what report has told me; that he is the favour'd lover—but surely it cannot be—I must be more worthy your partiality than he is?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have your taste, my lord, and I have mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>But reflect upon my birth, my title, my for∣tune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! when a heart gives itself away, depend upon it, it never reflects upon the cause.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is it possible you can yield your charms to a cold philosopher?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he is warm to me, his coldness upon all other occasions does me the greater honour—farewel, and believe, that to <HI>whom so ever</HI> I have given my heart, it is gone past recal.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> EMILY.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, still sighing, my lord?—still repeat∣ing vows of everlasting love to one who will not listen,
<PB N="21" REF="030339_0021_0FE5C5839BC05AD8"/>but while she holds your heart a captive, inhumanly exposes you to the derision of a rival.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell me who that rival is, and my obligations to you will be unbounded.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I do tell you, will you promise to fight him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is an engagement—I don't like to enter into—and why should you request it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because both he and you have offended me, by prefering my sister, and I should like to see you engaged in a duel, through pure revenge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now I suspect who my rival is—'tis Dori∣mant—your jealousy convinces me of it, for I know you love him, and I once thought the affection mutual.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be not too confident you have found out your rival—you may be mistaken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I am sure I am not—and he is beneath my notice—I shall yet win her from him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is impossible—because whoever Matilda loves—he is her husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! <STAGE>[Starting.]</STAGE> Married!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, married.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Distraction!—my hopes for ever gone—my pride, my vanity piqued.</P>
<STAGE>[Aside.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Notwithstanding your endeavour to conceal it, I see vexation painted on your countenance—indeed, my lord, I pity you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pity me—that's worse than the loss of the woman <STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE>—By heaven, if you think I am chagrined, or even disappointed, you wrong me—I never loved seriously—do you suppose I meant to marry?—ha, ha, ha.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, be composed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Sdeath, madam, I am composed— <STAGE>[raising his voice.]</STAGE> 'Tis you, and you only, that make me otherwise —for here I vow, if I feel a momentary pang, the least sense of sorrow, it is solely in compassion to the poor husband—him I pity, even while I despise and laugh at him.—Ha, ha, ha, ha.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>And these are your real sentiments.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Because, from the friendship sir John has for you, and suspecting your love for the lady, as soon as he is told of this marriage, he will dread the effect it may have on you.</P>
</SP>

<P>Then at once to put him out of doubt, I will go and tell him my sentiments—and we will both laugh at the husband—ha, ha, ha.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Classick.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear son, what pleasure do I feel in seeing and embracing you again—You, the sole sup∣port of my declining years—the sole prop of my de∣clining spirits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Tradewell.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[Going up to him.]</STAGE> And what brings you here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Classick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure I may be permitted to visit my own son, without being called to an account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Tradewell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your visit, notwithstanding, might be dispensed with— <STAGE>[to <HI>sir John</HI>]</STAGE>—he does not come so many miles for the pleasure of seeing you—he has some new wants to be supplied, I warrant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whatever be the motive, his coming gives me pleasure. <STAGE>[<HI>Aside</HI> to Tradewell]</STAGE>—Your behaviour pierces me to the heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Classick.</SPEAKER>
<P>To meet my son and my brother both together, is a happiness unexpected—and since it has thus happened, I will enjoy the pleasure the meeting gives me, without suffering the seeming unkindness of <HI>any one</HI> to diminish it.—Heaven bless you both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Tradewell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, be liberal of your blessings, for you have nothing else to bestow—no other portion to give your son.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I value them much more than all your inheritance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Tradewell.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are the precepts of philoso∣phy. But by our ordinary rules, a father takes care, and provide for his children. Between him and you
<PB N="24" REF="030339_0024_0FE5C56867D11998"/>the order of nature has been reversed, for these ten years past.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Classick.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I glory more to live at his ex∣pence, than were he to live at mine—the benefits I re∣ceive from him come to me like blessings; and their value is doubled by the pleasure I see him take in bestowing them.—But these are sensations which your heart is unacquainted with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Tradewell.</SPEAKER>
<P>What has made you thus poor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Classick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Honour and honesty.—What has made you thus rich?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Tradewell.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[Hesitating.]</STAGE> You know I have been for many years a contractor—had I depended on my honour and honesty, I might have been as poor as you—and with all your contempt of the means of acquiring riches, you have no objection to partake of them—you have submitted to my becoming a father to your son, from his infancy; and now, while you, with all your boasted affection, cannot give him a shilling, I am going to marry him to a large fortune, and to settle another upon himself. Does this wound your delicacy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Classick.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—it almost makes me weep in gra∣titude—but to whom are you going to marry him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Tradewell.</SPEAKER>
<P>She's the daughter of my wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Classick.</SPEAKER>
<P>I rejoice at such an alliance.—Come, brother, let these approaching nuptials unite us all in love and friendship; forget our frivolous differences, for in my heart I am grateful and affectionate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some obstacles may prevent the marriage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Classick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh no—it has no doubt been planned with too much care.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Tradewell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Brother, it is one of the best con∣tracts I ever made.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>But allow me time, sir, to gain the lady's heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Tradewell.</SPEAKER>
<P>A lady's heart may be gained in a day—sometimes in an hour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not such a heart as I would possess.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Tradewell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well—I'll give you eight days—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is too short a time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="25" REF="030339_0025_0FE5C54BCF640C58"/>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Tradewell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not too short to win eight hundred women—I wish I had a contract for as many as I myself could win in that time—and by sending them to the ladies I have no doubt but I might encrease my fortune half a million.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>How much soever I may dread your re∣sentment, sir, I must declare I cannot marry at present.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Tradewell.</SPEAKER>
<P>If ye belong to me—but no—it is to him you belong—and him you are like—had you been mine, then you might have been like me, comply∣ing, obedient, amiable, and gentle—but till you prove yourself so, I have done with you—nor will I give six∣pence to a man, who does not look up to me as a pattern and model for all his action<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Classick.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is the matter?—Where is your usual joy on seeing me?—perhaps my coming has dis∣pleased you—if so, seek no excuses but let me go away, and come another time, when y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pect me.</P>

<SP>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Classick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your wife!—Are you then married?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes—I consulted affection, and not am∣bition, and have therefore concealed my marriage; lest the world, as well as you, should blame me for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Classick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is your wife prudent?—Is she such as you wished to find her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Classick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you have made an excellent match.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>This kindness consoles, and makes me less unhappy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Classick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where is she?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here in this house, accompanied by her sister, and another lady, who passes for her relation, and the mistress of the house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Classick.</SPEAKER>
<P>We m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> think of some expedient to divert your uncle's attention for the present, and during the delay we may contrive some means to declare your marriage with safety.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the idea of the event being divulged, after having thus long concealed it, makes me all con∣fusion—sooner or later I shall get the better of this strange humour—but at present I cannot suppress the shame I feel, lest the world should know I am married.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Classick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not be ashamed of a good woman —you philosophers are ever searching after novelty, and what could you show the world more worthy their attention than a good wife?—In all your researches, my son, nothing could so well establish yours, and your <HI>children</HI>'s fame.

<P>As I went out, sir John, I met your uncle and your father, both returning—and your uncle communicated to me a project he means immediately to put into execution.—He has been informed of your mar∣riage, that it took place abroad, and without all the due forms to render it legal—He therefore means to annul it.</P>

<P>Annul my marriage?—Let him—then openly, and in the face of day, I'll marry her again.— <STAGE>[Going, and taking her hand.]</STAGE>—Annul my marriage?— Make void the happiest action of my life?—An act which gave to my gloomy mind a friend, a soothing partner to reform it.</P>

<P>Dear lady, I this moment parted from mr. Tradewell Classick, and he assures me he is going to set aside your sister's marriage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, my lord—and this is the time for you—a woman disconsolate and forsaken.</P>
</SP>

<P>But she shan't be forsaken; in spite of all I may have said, I have a great mind to go and offer my∣self to her again.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[Bowing.]</STAGE> You are very good—you are, upon all occasions, my good friend—You first discovered to me the marriage, though you could not tell me with whom—and then, unfortunately, you sent me to laugh at the very man himself.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorimant.</SPEAKER>
<P>How then can you offer yourself on the present occasion? for he, no doubt, has told her what you said.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter, his lordship can unsay it—he can go and protest to sir John, what he said was the mere effect of resentment; for that while he laughed, he was ready to cry.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Tradewell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh the great scholar, that could not learn to live single a few years—the great philosopher, who scorns to understand the value of money: nor from me shall he ever know the comforts of it; for I disinhe∣rit him, but upon one condition—unless he consents to declare his marriage invalid.</P>

<P>Oh! your humble servant, madam —What, you are the pretended wife, I suppose?—you are the lady who has ensnared him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ensnare—ensnare a man with his head forti∣fied with Latin and Greek, and his heart made hard with philosophy.—You might as well suppose a poor honest tradesman could ensnare a rich, hardened con∣tractor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Tradewell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here's a vixen—reflecting on the means by which I have acquired my riches—But let me tell you, madam, my nephew's marriage is an illegal one, and I will take care to make you both ashamed of it.</P>

<P>In that case, we cannot retaliate, for I sup∣pose there is not any thing you would be ashamed of.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Tradewell.</SPEAKER>
