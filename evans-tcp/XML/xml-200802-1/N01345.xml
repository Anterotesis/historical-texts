<Q><HI>And</HI> Abraham <HI>said, Because I thought, Surely the Fear of GOD is not in this Place; and they will Slay me, &amp;c.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is observed by the Learned, that in the earliest Ages of the World, those who had the greatest Authority Civil, had likewise the Sacred conjoyned with it: That as Civil Society's are no other than a Combination of particular Family's, so before Family's associated into those larger Society's, the Master of the Fa∣mily was the Priest of it.</P>
<P>And that hence it is that we read of <HI>Noah, Jacob</HI> and <HI>Job,</HI> that they Sacrificed; and of <HI>Abraham'</HI>s Instructing his Family. Every Head of a Family was both King and Priest in his House, and performed the respective Functions belonging to each. Afterward (as most conceive) the First-born in Family's had the possession of the Priesthood, and were
<PB N="2" REF="001598_0003_0FB3E7F540C38E80"/>
exercised in it till the giving of the Law. To Confirm which Opinion, that Text (with some others) is alledged; which we have, Numb. 3. 11, 12. <HI>And the Lord spake unto</HI> Moses, <HI>saying, And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the Children of</HI> Israel, <HI>instead of all the First-born that openeth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> among the Children of</HI> Israel: <HI>therefo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vites shall be mine.</HI> Where we find God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Levites from among the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> instead of the First-born. But whether this was so or not, yet most certain it is, that the Civil and Sacred Powers were united in the same Per∣sons; and that not only in the Morning of the World, before Family's (for mutual advan∣tages) associated together; but we have in∣stances of it also afterward, even till by Posi∣tive Laws the power of the Priesthood was re∣strained to the Tribe of <HI>Levi.</HI> Thus (as the Sacred Oracles inform us) <HI>Melchisedeck</HI> was both King and Priest in <HI>Salem;</HI> and upon the acount of his two-fold Office (as well as in other respects) was an Eminent Type of Christ, <HI>who is a Priest upon a Throne.</HI> So we find <HI>Moses</HI> (in like manner) exercising both these Powers, till <HI>Aaron</HI> and his Sons were Consecrated to the latter of them, <HI>Exod.</HI> 24. 5. <HI>&amp;</HI> 29. 35. And hence is that expression, <HI>Psal.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9.6. Moses <HI>and</HI> Aaron <HI>among His Priests.</HI> In imitation of which, probably it was that in
<PB N="3" REF="001598_0004_0FB3E7F6C37D0548"/>
the <HI>Gentile</HI> World (after the dispersion) as there were Sacrifices and other Solemnity's of Sacred estimation, attended in Honour of their Gods, so the Power of the Priesthood was often possessed by those of Royal Dignity among them. Profane Story furnishes us with instances of this nature; particularly a∣mong the <HI>Egyptians, Lacaedemonians</HI> &amp; <HI>Romans,</HI> divers of whose Emperors (even after these Powers were separated among them) are said to retain the Title of <HI>Pontifex Maximus,</HI> a∣mong the rest of their Imperial Honours.</P>
<P>Tis not to be doubted, but that the exercise of these two Offices by those holy Persons of old, was very agreeable to the mind of God. As for <HI>Moses,</HI> what he did in either of them, was by express Warrant from God: And altho' we find not the like as to others, yet there is no reason to doubt, but they acted by a like Divine Authority therein.</P>
<P>Now this Union of these two Powers in the same Persons in those Ages of the World, as its otherwise Instructive, so particularly it Sug∣gests to us the Mutual Serviceableness of Ci∣vil Government and Religion each to other. Civil Government duly Administred, contri∣butes not a little to the Well-being, Growth &amp; Progress of Religion in Society's; and this on the other hand, is highly conducive to the due and successful Administration of Civil
<PB N="4" REF="001598_0005_0FB3E7F8577FCEE0"/>
Government. Of such importance is Reli∣gion to these ends, that where it is not, there is little reason to hope for or expect them. In this case, as Government is not likely to be duly Administred, so neither to be attended with Success in its Administrations: Religion being as necessary to a due Observance of Good Laws, as to the Making and due Execu∣tion of them.</P>
<P>So depraved is the Nature of Man in his fallen State, and such is the mighty Power &amp; Influence of Sin in him, that where the Pow∣erful influences &amp; restraints of Religion are wanting, there is little reason to hope that either Rulers or Ruled, will adorn their Places by a due discharge of the Duty's of either of them. <HI>Abraham</HI> seems to have been very sensible of the truth of this, when he reply's to <HI>Abimelech,</HI> as in our Text; <HI>Be∣cause I thought, Surely the Fear of God is not in this Place; and they will Slay me,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In the first Verse of this Chapter, we have an account of <HI>Abraham'</HI>s remove from <HI>Mamre</HI> to <HI>Gerar; And</HI> Abraham <HI>journey'd from thence toward the</HI> South-<HI>countrey, and dwelled between</HI> Kadesh &amp; Shur, <HI>and sojourned in</HI> Gerar. He had dwelt in the Plain of <HI>Mamre</HI> about four∣teen Years, and now removes (as is conjectu∣red) because of the nearness of the stinking Lake of <HI>Sodom</HI> thereto. This is follow'd with
<PB N="5" REF="001598_0006_0FB3E7F9C0D64F48"/>
an account of <HI>Abimelech'</HI>s taking <HI>Sarah</HI> his Wife, thinking she had been his Sister; ver. 2. <HI>And</HI> Abraham <HI>said of</HI> Sarah <HI>his Wife, She is my Sister: and</HI> Abimelech <HI>King of</HI> Gerar, <HI>sent &amp; took</HI> Sarah. Whereupon God appears to <HI>Abimelech</HI> in a Dream, admonishes him of his Sin and Danger in what he had done, and Charges him to restore her again, <HI>Ver.</HI>3,—8. Tis observable, that God in the Charge He here gives to <HI>Abimelech,</HI> styles <HI>Abraham</HI> a Pro∣phet; ver. 7. <HI>Now therefore restore the man his Wife; for he is a Prophet, and he shall Pray for thee,</HI> &amp;c. From which Text (with some o∣thers) I may observe to you by the way, its inferred by some; That the true Notion of a Prophet, lies not in foretelling future events, but in declaring &amp; interpreting to the World the Mind of God received by immediate Re∣velation from Him: That a Persons receiving that which he makes known to others by im∣mediate Revelation from God, is that which formally Constitutes a Prophet; and that its wholly extrinsecal what time his Prophesy respects, whether that which is past, present, or to come: And that therefore <HI>Abraham</HI> here has this Title given to him; and he with <HI>Isaac</HI> &amp; <HI>Jacob</HI> are called Prophets, Psal. 105. 15. <HI>Touch not mine Anointed, &amp; do my Prophets no harm.</HI> Not because of any Predictions uttered by them, but because of the frequency of imme∣diate
<PB N="6" REF="001598_0007_0FB3E7FB38864E70"/>
Revelations to them. Consonant to which we find, that those in the New Testa∣ment who Expounded the Scriptures by im∣mediate Inspiration, are called Prophets, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14. 32. But this by the way.</P>
<P><HI>Abimelech</HI> being thus admonished of God, and acquainted that <HI>Sarah</HI> was the Wife of <HI>A∣braham,</HI> resolves to restore her; sends for <HI>A∣braham</HI> and Expostulates with him, for his so dealing with him, <HI>ver.</HI> 9, 10. Hereupon <HI>Abra∣ham</HI> Apologises for himself, <HI>ver.</HI> 11,—14. Our Text is a part of this Apology; <HI>Because I thought, Surely,</HI> &amp;c. In which words two Things are observable.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Abraham'</HI>s expression of his fear of Bar∣barous Treatment in that place, <HI>They will Slay me for my Wives sake.</HI> Which he mentions as the reason why he had said of <HI>Sarah,</HI> that she was his Sister.</P>
<P N="2">2. We have the special Reason of this Fear, <HI>viz.</HI> the want of Religion, or the Knowledge &amp; Fear of God in that place: <HI>Because I thought, Surely the Fear of God is not in this Place.</HI> The expression is not to be understood, as imply∣ing a wrong tho't or apprehension concerning the Place, as if he had conceiv'd it destitute of the Knowledge and Fear of God, when really it was not. One<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Arias Montanus.</HI></NOTE> more agreeably
<PB N="7" REF="001598_0008_0FB3E7FCC9C6AB98"/>
with the Original Text renders this Clause, <HI>Because I said, Verily,</HI> (or Truly) <HI>the Fear of God is not in this Place.</HI> Q. D. I said, or knew it to be void of the true Fear of God, &amp; there∣fore Feared, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Which Phrase (the Fear of God) seems here to be comprehensive both of the Act and Rule of holy Fear.</P>
<P N="1">1. Of the <HI>Act:</HI> Which is here put (as it elsewhere is in Scripture) for the whole of Religion. <HI>Eccl.</HI> 12. 13. The Fear of God be∣ing not only in it self an Eminent part of Religion; but also a Grace that has a peculiar influence upon all other parts of it, is not un∣fitly put for the whole of it. And upon this account it is, that sometimes men of Piety (or Religion) are described by this Divine Qua∣lification, <HI>Job</HI> 1. 1,8.<HI>Psal.</HI>25.12,-14. <HI>&amp;</HI> 128. 1.</P>
<P N="2">2. Of the <HI>Rule of Fear;</HI> the Law or Word of God. So this Phrase is sometimes taken, Psal.19.9. <HI>The Fear of the Lord is Clean.</HI> Where by <HI>[Fear]</HI> is intended the Law of God, or Rule by which its guided: So here, the Phrase seems to be inclusive of this. For altho' in that day of the World, the Will of God, or Rule of Religion was not committed to Wri∣ting, yet the People of God had it by Tradi∣tion. God appeared to <HI>Adam, Abraham,</HI> and the other Patriarchs, made known His Will to them, &amp; from them 'twas handed down to others. So that this part of <HI>Abraham'</HI>s Apo∣logy
<PB N="8" REF="001598_0009_0FB3E7FEAD645898"/>
amounts to thus much; <HI>q. d.</HI> <Q>Tho' the Place I am in be not altogether Barbarous, wholly without Civil Subordination or Go∣vernment; and Persons are not entirely at liberty to pursue their own Desires, yet be∣cause its destitute of the Knowledge of God and His Will, and consequently of the Fear &amp; Reverence of them, which in all Persons (of what Character o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Degree soever) is the best Preservative from Evils of any kind; I could not therefore promise my self Pro∣tection &amp; Safety here, was afraid that other Restraints would be ineffectual to bridle mens Lusts, and prevent their offering Vio∣lence to my Person, if <HI>Sarah</HI> were known to be my Wife; and therefore said she is my Sister.</Q> In a word; Our Text Suggests to us the Miserable State of those Society's, as to their Civil Concerns, where (or in which) Government has not the powerful influences of Religion attending of it: And from thence this Truth may be offer'd for the Subject of our present Consideration &amp; Improvement, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><LABEL>DOCTRINE.</LABEL> That Religion is not only Consistent with, but great∣ly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to the Due and Successful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Civil Government in Society's.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="001598_0010_0FB3E7FFCCEDF790"/>
The Term [<HI>Religion</HI>] in our Doctrine, is wont to be variously apply'd &amp; taken: Some∣times Subjectively, for the internal Princi∣ples and Acts of it: Sometimes Objectively, for the Word of God, or Rule of Religion: Sometimes for the particular Form or Man∣ner of Worship in Society's: Tis to be un∣derstood here in the former of these Accep∣tations. And in this sense, so necessary is it to these ends, that where it is wanting (even in Society's that are otherwise under the best Regulations) there is little reason to hope that either Government should be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ely Administred, or any of the ends of it Obtained: That good Order, Peace, Tran∣quility should flourish in them.</P>
<P>That Religion (in general) is very Ser∣viceable to the designs of Government, seems to be a Principle which Nature furnishes men withal. Hence we find, that those who in former Ages have introduced particular Forms of Government among these &amp; those in the <HI>Gentile</HI> World, have therewith been careful to introduce Religion likewise. Thus those fa∣mous Law-givers, <HI>Hormes, Solon, Lycurgus, Numa,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And most certain it is, that of such advan∣tage to the designs of Government, was even the <HI>Pagan</HI> Religion in many Places, that
<PB N="10" REF="001598_0011_0FB3E8012E142098"/>
an <HI>Heathen</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Plutarch.</HI></NOTE> could make this <HI>Remark,</HI> viz. <HI>That Religion is a Foundation that limits and joyns So∣ciety's together.</HI> And again; <HI>That it is as im∣possible for a Common-Wealth to Subsist without Re∣ligion, as a City without Foundations.</HI> But what Virtue soever it might have this way, yet cer∣tain it is, that as none of the Vanity's of the <HI>Heathen</HI> may compare with the true GOD; so neither, the Influences of their Abomina∣tions, with those of the true Religion in this point.</P>
<P>He that rightly Considers this, and withal the Influences of it upon the Minds of men, will soon be convinc'd of this, and say, That nothing is equally Serviceable with this to promote these Ends: And that this of all things most powerfully Obliges men to act in a due observance of the several Obligations they lie under to God, themselves, and one another. In a word; What was wont to be said of the imaginary Soul of the World, may be said of true Religion in Society's, it ty's each part to it self, and one to another; and disposes of every thing for the good and advantage of the Whole. And this truth is in part at last Confessed by the greatest E∣nemy's of it, when they tell us of Religion (Objectively taken,) that its a thing of Hu∣mane
<PB N="11" REF="001598_0012_0FB3E802B8E25CD8"/>
Original, the Politick Device of Princes the better to awe and keep their Subjects in Obedience: Which altho' it be a most unjust Imputation upon it, yet supposes the Truth now asserted. And accordingly, this and all other means proper to Maintain, Secure and Advance it, are wont to be Commended (by the greatest Masters of Civil Policy) to the particular Care and Regard of Society's, as things which are likely to be fruitful in the best Consequents.</P>
<P>There are Two <HI>Propositions,</HI> the one suppo∣sed, the other express'd in the <HI>Doctrine.</HI></P>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>Tis supposed, that Religion is not of the Essence of Civil Government: Or that Civil Government may be in Society's</HI> (in some sort at least) <HI>without it.</HI> It is easy to distinguish, between Government in the abstracted Noti∣on of it, and the due Constitution, regular Successful Exercise or Administration of it. The difference between these is very great, and the Proposition intends the former; not the latter. Religion is not Essential to con∣vey to Persons a right to Rule; [Dominion is not founded in Grace] nor yet to the Dis∣charge of the Material part of the Duty's, either of the Ruler or the Ruled. These two, <HI>viz.</HI> Religion, and Government in Soci∣ety's, tho' they are very Essential, &amp; highly
<PB N="12" REF="001598_0013_0FB3E8045423F1E0"/>
Contribute to the Well-being each of other, yet are not so inseparably Connected, that we may say of them as of Relates, <HI>That they take each other; and can in no wise Subsist alone.</HI> These things are not only mentally separable, but really &amp; in fact are so. But this by the way.</P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>Tho' this be so, yet Religion is not only Consistent with, but highly Serviceable to ad∣vance the due and successful Exercise of Govern∣ment.</HI> There are different Forms of Govern∣ment, &amp; various Modifications of these Forms, wherein the Power of Rulers is laid under different Limitations or Restraints, and the Liberty or Priviledge of the Ruled various in Degree. Moreover, There are various Or∣ders or Ranks of Persons in the Seat of Go∣vernment: Some acting in an higher, others in a lower Sphere, having different Titles &amp; Powers annex'd to them. But whatever Form of Government may be in any Society's, and however Regulated, &amp; whatever Orders or Ranks of Persons may be Employ'd in the Administration of Rule in them, (be they Supream or Subordinate) yet Religion is of the last Consequence to these Ends.</P>
<P>Agreeably to this, the Wisdom of Christian Nations has always directed them to shew particular Regard to this, Countenance and Encourage it, and all proper Methods for the
<PB N="13" REF="001598_0014_0FB3E805B033AD08"/>
Propagation of it; and this as for other rea∣sons, so particularly because of its benign in∣fluences upon the Civil Concerns of all So∣ciety's.</P>
<P>Under this <HI>Proposition,</HI> I shall endeavour to shew how, or by what means Religion becomes so Serviceable to these Ends; and that I may not exceed the Bounds of your Patience, shall endeavour to reduce the several Ways by which it does so, unto the Five following more General Heads.[<HI>I.</HI>] It Contributes to these Ends as it Establishes Good Principles. [<HI>II.</HI>] As it Directs and Influences Rulers to pursue the best Maxims or Rules of Go∣vernment.[<HI>III.</HI>] As it Influences them in all Administrations, carefully to Observe the proper Extent and Limits of their Power. [<HI>IV.</HI>] As it lays the most forcible Obliga∣tions, both upon Rulers &amp; Ruled, to be Faith∣ful in their respective Duty's. [<HI>V.</HI>] As it Restrains &amp; Subdues those Lusts that are the Causes of all Irregularity and Unsuccessful∣ness of Government in its Administrations. There seems not to be any way wherein Re∣ligion is Serviceable to these Ends, but what may be reduc'd to one or other of these Heads.</P>
<P>I. <HI>It Contributes to these Ends, as it Establishes Good Principles: Asserts the Divine Original of Government, and Founds it in Divine Insti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tion.</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="001598_0015_0FB3E8074FCD9BC8"/>
That however Particular Forms of Govern∣ment (with the various Regulations they are under) can't (as such) lay Claim to a Divine Right, yet that Government in General, Civil Subordination and Power is the Ordinance of Heaven. Most certain it is, that whether there be Government among Men yea or not, is not a matter left to Humane Determinati∣on; but it's already Resolved by the Most High, <HI>That there be a Rule over Men▪ The God of</HI> Israel <HI>hath Said it, the Rock of</HI> Israel <HI>has E∣stablished it.</HI> And the Power of those who are Exalted to the Seats of Government, is from Him. Whatever the particular Instruments or Means of Conveying this Power, and Vest∣ing it in these and those particular Persons (that Sway the Scepter over a People) may be, yet the Power it self is from God; a Ray of His. In Elective States, where Persons are Advanc'd by the Suffrage of others to Places of Rule, and Vested with Civil Power, the Persons Chusing give not the Power, but GOD. They are but the Instruments of Conveyance, and do but Design the Persons that shall re∣ceive it from Him. And hence it is, that Hu∣mane Laws bind the Conscience: Not simply as Humane, but as made by that Authority which is Divine in its Original, and to which Obedience is Commanded in the Divine Law. Now with this useful point of Knowledge
<PB N="15" REF="001598_0016_0FB3E808C5BCE710"/>
Christianity furnishes Persons: It instills and establishes such Principles as these, viz. <HI>The Powers that be, are Ordained of God; and there is no Power but of God,</HI> Rom. 13. 1. <HI>By Him Princes Rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the Earth,</HI> Prov. 8. 16. <HI>Rulers are His Ministers for Good,</HI> Rom. 13. 4. And by this means become ser∣viceable to these ends. Such Principles as these respecting Government, greatly contri∣bute to the Rectitude &amp; Success of it. They greatly promote Fidelity in Rulers, by a due exercise of their Authority.</P>
<P>When Rulers are Established in this, and duely Consider that they are Gods by deputa∣tion, the Ministers of the Most High, Arm'd and Vested with His Power, &amp; that with this design, <HI>viz.</HI> That they may be as Gods to those over whom they Rule, by a due imita∣tion of the Excellency's appearing in the Di∣vine Government, it will entertain them with many strong and forcible Motives to utmost Application in endeavours to answer the end of their Creation, by a due Exercise of the Authority Vested in them.</P>
<P>And as for those who are in a state of Sub∣jection, or under Rule, such will be the influ∣ence of these tho'ts upon them, as will have a good tendency to give Success to those Administrations.</P>
<P>Where these Principles of Christianity have
<PB N="16" REF="001598_0017_0FB3E80A33087018"/>
not obtain'd in Society's, Persons are ignorant of them: Or any Principles of a contrary Na∣ture are advanc'd; by reason whereof Civil Subordination or Rule, is look'd upon as Hu∣mane; a thing without Divine Warrant, Au∣thority, and the Sovereign Institution of God, tis fatally Prejudicial to these ends. Levelism directly tends at once to destroy both the Rectitude &amp; Success of Government; to make Rulers betray their Trust, prostitute their Authority to the worst designs, and to ener∣vate the Force of all their Administrations. Whereas these rectify'd tho'ts concerning it, render it Sacred &amp; Venerable in the eyes of all, inspire Rulers with the most Noble Re∣solves, and the Ruled with a due Fear and Reverence of it.</P>
<P>II. <HI>As it directs and influences Rulers, in all Administrations to pursue, or yield up themselves to the Guidance of the best Maxims or Rules of Government.</HI> This Fear of God, as it will pro∣duce in them an Abhorrence of such Rules of Government, which altho' they are recom∣mended by some as Healthful to a State, yet are really Prejudicial to whatever is desirable therein, so in the whole of their Conduct to yield up themselves to the Government of those that are of a contrary tendency. The due and successful Exercise of Government,
<PB N="17" REF="001598_0018_0FB3E80C824D1898"/>
has a necessary dependance upon this; inso∣much that where such wholesome Rules are wanting in Society's, or Rulers govern not themselves by them, but by unaccountable Humours, &amp; arbitrary Will, which are never Steady and Constant; and do not in this Ar∣ticle labour to imitate the Divine Govern∣ment; which is manag'd by fixed and steady Rules, there is no hope that either of these Ends will be obtain'd. Government agrees with all other Arts in this, that its manag'd by certain fix'd Rules or Precepts, and the Rectitude &amp; Success of it may no further be expected than those Rules are attended. By these and the wise and prudent Application of them, a State is Upheld and Perpetuated, the Beauty, Order, Proportion, Strength and Unity of it Maintain'd; and all hurtful Di∣stempers that threaten the Ruine of it, either Prevented or Purged out.</P>
<P>Agreeably to this, there are no Regular Well-order'd Society's where these things are not to be found. Indeed these Precepts of this Divine Art (as to all of them) are not the same in all Society's, but various according to the different Constitutions of them.</P>
<P>As the same Applications in Physick will not suit with all Body's, but due regard is wont to be had to the difference of Temper or Con∣stitution▪ so neither the same System of Po∣liticks
<PB N="18" REF="001598_0019_0FB3E80E06162AA0"/>
with all Body's Politick, nor yet with the same at all Times, and under all Emer∣gency's; and accordingly they are wont to be diversify'd with a Prudent Regard to the difference of Constitutions and Times.</P>
<P>Now whatever Rules of this Art of Govern∣ment are recommended, either in the Sacred Oracles, or by the best Masters of Civil Policy (agreeably thereto) as Healthful to a State (be they more general, or of a more restrain∣ed Nature) Religion will influence Rulers to act &amp; do all things in their respective Stations, under the Direction and Influence of them. And not only so, but will very much Fortify them against the dangerous impressions of any Temptations (alluring or terrible) tending to turn em aside from them: And by this means also, becomes Serviceable to these Ends.</P>
<P>Suffer me here, by the way, but to Suggest two or three of these, instead of many, that might be more largely insisted upon.</P>
<P N="1">1.<HI>'Twill influence Rulers in the whole of their Conduct, to appear with a distinguishing Zeal for the things God has put a peculiar Honour upon and Dignify'd with His Name.</HI> I mean, His Word, Worship, Ordinances, Day, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Zeal for God &amp; the things wherein His Glory is peculiarly concerned, is inseparable from the Fear of God. <HI>Elijah</HI> says, 1 King. 19. 10. <HI>I have been very Jea∣lous for the Lord of Hosts; for the Children of</HI> Is∣rael
<PB N="19" REF="001598_0020_0FB3E81044747CD8"/>
<HI>have forsaken thy Covenant, thrown down thine Altars,</HI> &amp;c. Wherever it is, it will produce a due Concern&amp;Care that the Name of God be Mag∣nifi'd, His Worship Maintain'd, His Ordinances &amp; Day Observ'd &amp; Reverenc'd, together with an inflam'd Indignation against whatever is Re∣pugnant to these things Now due Care &amp; Zeal in Rulers to preserve these things in due Esteem &amp; Veneration in Society's, is a Rule of Govern∣ment, the Healthful Nature of which to all So∣ciety's, both God &amp; Man concur in asserting.</P>
<P>'Tis a Rule, not only many ways recom∣mended in the Word of God, but moreover by the greatest Masters of Tho't, and that to all Society's however Constituted or Distinguish'd in their Formal Natures. I may insert here the words of one,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Machiavell.</HI></NOTE> who has deservedly ob∣tain'd a place among those of the first Rank for Wisdom; who treating of things tending to the Prosperity and Welfare of Civil Soci∣ety's, says of these things; <HI>That were they re∣garded by Rulers according to the Precepts &amp; In∣structions of Him that first gave &amp; appointed them, the States and Common-Wealths of</HI> Christendom, <HI>would be much more Happy and Firm.</HI> There needs no uncommon Sagacity to see the Pro∣priety of this Rule to the ends for which its wont to be recommended. He that believes
<PB N="20" REF="001598_0021_0FB3E811C8F6D0A8"/>
the truth asserted in our Doctrine▪ and withal considers that the design of God in these things, and in requiring our Reverent Observance of them, is our Conformity to Him; that by these things as Means, we might be made partakers of the Divine Nature, &amp; transform'd into His Likeness. In a word, That this Fear of Him might be instill'd into the hearts of Sinners, preserv'd &amp; flourish there, and that the Neg∣lect and Contempt of these things is utterly inconsistent with these designs, can't but see it to be a Rule of the last Consequence to the Civil Good of Society's, and in particular to the Ends mention'd in our Doctrine.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It will influence Rulers to employ their Wisdom &amp; Power</HI> (as far as they may) <HI>to Rectify what∣ever in the State is Prejudicial to these Ends.</HI> As Religion&amp;Reason joyntly concur in asserting it as a good Rule of Policy, that Rulers to their utmost assert&amp;maintain whatever in the State apparently tends to advance these ends; so no less that their Wisdom &amp; Power be pru∣dently employ'd to rectify whatever therein stands in the way of them; and that whether it be in the main frame of their Administra∣tions, or any thing else. Among the several Forms of Government in the World, there are some apparently unsuitable to these ends; they are proportion'd not to Advance any designs of Government, but to gratify Pride, Tyranny &amp; Oppression.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="001598_0022_0FB3E8135C768F60"/>
Others, altho' they are more adapted to these ends, yet not all equally so; some are more advantagiously suited to the ends of Go∣vernment than others. And hence doubtless, it is in a great measure that the Success of Go∣vernment in its Administrations in different Places is so Various. The greatest Sagacity &amp; Prudence is necessary in founding States, and drawing the Plan or Scheme of Government in Society's: And many times notwithstanding the best Prudence &amp; Conduct, great Errors are committed in the management of that Affair.</P>
<P>Sometimes again in Governments of the most perfect Model, or advantagious Form, the due &amp; successful Exercise of it is otherwise Ob∣structed. Tis difficult to enumerate the many things in Society's which many times concur to hinder the due Exercise of Government, &amp; obstruct its Success. But whatever it be that stands in the way of these things, this will in∣fluence Rulers to use all due and proper Me∣thods for the removal of it. As for what may be amiss in the main frame of their Ad∣ministrations, they will be hereby led to recti∣fy, &amp; as far as is in their Power, &amp; may be done with Safety to the State, they will endeavour to reduce all things to the most perfect Model.</P>
<P>And as for whatever else may prejudice these things, they will take care to remove them. Men of Corrupt Principles &amp; Practices,
<PB N="22" REF="001598_0023_0FB3E814EFE0D600"/>
who many times (by managing their Private views &amp; designs) put all things out of Order in Society's, (as <HI>Solomon</HI> suggests, <HI>Prov.25.5.</HI>) They will be hereby influenc'd to discard &amp; put from them. And whatever Establish∣ments may have been made, &amp; prove really dis∣serviceable to these ends, they will reverse, or so alter as to make them Contribute to the carrying on these good Designs.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Where &amp; as far as Places of Trust &amp; Power are at the dispose of Rulers, this will influence them in preferring Persons to them, to have entire regard to their Merits, or those suitable Qualifications, that justly recommend them thereto.</HI> In the ma∣nagement of this affair, it will dispose them to lay aside Faction, Interest, Affection, &amp; all those Private Views which too often are wont to in∣fluence in affairs of that Nature, and to regard those Natural &amp; Divine Qualifications men∣tion'd in the Word of God as necessary in those who are to Rule over Men. In a word; Among the Precepts of Wisdom left us by that Wisest of Kings <HI>Solomon,</HI> in his Book of <HI>Proverbs,</HI> there are many excellent Rules of Go∣vernment suggested. He tells us, Chap. 16. 12. <HI>It is an abomination to Kings to commit Wickedness: and that the Throne is established by Righteousness.</HI> And 25.2,-5. <HI>It is the Glory of God to conceal a thing; but the Honour of Kings is to search out a matter. Take away the Wicked from before the
<PB N="23" REF="001598_0024_0FB3E8170D6C5720"/>
King, and his Throne shall be established in Righ∣teousness.</HI> And 20. 28. <HI>Mercy and Truth pre∣serve the King, &amp; his Throne is upholden by Mercy.</HI> And 28.16. <HI>The Prince that wanteth Understand∣ing, is a great Oppressor: but he that hateth Cove∣tousness, shall prolong his Days.</HI> Concerning all which (with others) as we may say they sug∣gest excellent Precepts, very necessary to be observed by Rulers (of what Rank or Degree soever) in their Publick Capacity, so Religion will influence them, not only to View them in Idea, but Exemplify them in their Conduct.</P>
<P>III. <HI>As it influences Rulers in all Administra∣tions, carefully to observe the proper Extent &amp; Li∣mits of their Power.</HI> This Particular Properly belongs to the forementioned General; and might have been there mentioned as a Rule of Civil Policy, which this Fear of God will in∣fluence Rulers (in their Conduct) to observe; but I chuse to Consider it by it self. As all Civil Power is a Derivative, comes from God, and is a Ray of His, so is it His Prerogative to impart it in what Degrees He pleases, and to fix the Bounds &amp; Limits of it; which ac∣cordingly He has done in His Word. As He has therein Ordained a Subordination among Men, that some have a right to Rule over o∣thers; so likewise has He given Laws to their Authority, and not left them at Liberty to
<PB N="24" REF="001598_0025_0FB3E8188E2BB368"/>
Pursue and Accomplish their own Desires.</P>
<P>And as for the various Degrees of Persons, that may be Employ'd in the exercise of Rule, and the respective Limitations of their Power, tho' it be a matter left to Humane determi∣nation, yet must be Manag'd with due regard to those General Laws God has given, descri∣bing &amp; determining the Bounds of Humane Authority.</P>
<P>In the Management of this Affair, as due Care must be taken to Vest such Powers in Men as by a due Exercise of which the gene∣ral Ends of Government may be provided for, so likewise that no Authority be Vested in them, that is not Proportioned to those Ends. Now I say, whatever Powers may by the Positive Laws of Society's, be settled upon these and those (be they Supreme or Subor∣dinate in the Seat of Government) in Subor∣dination to those Laws of God before men∣tioned; Religion will influence them in the whole of their Conduct, to have due regard to the proper Extent and Limits of it. As it will oblige them to exercise the Utmost of their Authority, to further the designs of Go∣vernment; so on the other hand, to be very Cautious how they encounter and bear down the Laws with their Prerogative. And that this Fear of God in this way Contributes not a little to the ends mention'd in our Doctrine,
<PB N="25" REF="001598_0026_0FB3E81A05D95850"/>
will be very evident in two or three Articles.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Power Vested by God in Rulers, is a Li∣mited Power.</HI> As it is a Power Subordinate to God's, so Limited by Him. This is true, whe∣ther we speak of Power Supreme or Subordi∣nate. We find, <HI>Deut.</HI> 17. 18, 19. God giving this Solemn Charge to him who should first be advanc'd to Royal Dignity over His People; <HI>That he should write him a Copy of the Law in a Book, out of that which was before the Priests and Levites; that it should be with him, that he should Read therein all the days of his Life;</HI> and that for these Ends, viz. <HI>That he might learn to Fear the Lord his God; and to keep all the Words of this Law; that his Heart might not be lift up above his Brethren; and that he turn not aside from the Commandment to the Right hand, or to the Left.</HI> And its observed by Interpreters, upon 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 10. 25. Where it is said upon <HI>Saul'</HI>s Election to be King, <HI>that</HI> Samuel <HI>told the People the Man∣ner of the Kingdom, &amp; Wrote it in a Book, &amp; Laid it up before the Lord.</HI> Its observed I say, that when that People would not be Satisfy'd with∣out a King, that <HI>Samuel</HI> did by Divine Appoint∣ment, write the Manner of the Kingdom in a Book; <HI>i. e.</HI> Those Fundamental Laws or Rules, by which that Form of Government should be Regulated among them. So we find <HI>Moses,</HI> by the Direction of the Unerring Spirit, giving it in Charge to the Subordinate
<PB N="26" REF="001598_0027_0FB3E81B8862D1F0"/>
Rulers, the Judges among that People; Deut. 1. 16, 17. <HI>That they should Hear the Causes be∣tween their Brethren, and Judge Righteously be∣tween every Man &amp; his Brother, and the Stranger that was with them. That they should not respect Persons in Judgment; but hear the Small as well as the Great; that they should not be afraid of the Face of Man, and that because the Judgment was God's.</HI> Much to the same purpose, we find that worthy King <HI>Jehosaphat,</HI> Charging the Succeeding Judges afterward; 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 19. 6,7,9. And who knows not, that God gave to His People of old Laws Political, by which Rulers were oblig'd to proceed in Affairs of Govern∣ment; many of which being founded on Com∣mon Equity, and not immediately respecting the Common-wealth of the <HI>Jews,</HI> as such are of Common and Perpetual Obligation.</P>
<P>The declared design of God in Vesting Ci∣vil Power in any, carry's in it Evidence to this Truth; <HI>This is</HI> (as the Apostle declares, <HI>Rom.</HI> 13.4.) <HI>that they may be the Ministers of Good.</HI> And by Consequence, their Power is so limited as to be proportion'd to that End. Its not in the Power of Rulers to make what Laws they please, Suspend, Abrogate or Disanul them at pleasure. It was the Saying of an <HI>Heathen,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tacitus.</HI></NOTE> and indeed it became only such an one; <HI>Prin∣cipi
<PB N="27" REF="001598_0028_0FB3E81D161F3D10"/>
Summum rerum Arbitrium Dij dederunt; Sub∣ditis Obsequij Gloria relicta est: i. e.</HI> The only thing left to the Ruled, is to Obey the Arbi∣trary Determination of Princes.</P>
<P>God has not Subjected the Lives, &amp; Liber∣ty's of the Ruled, to the Arbitrary Will and Pleasure of Rulers. <HI>David</HI> contracted the Guilt of Murther in the Death of <HI>Uriah,</HI> as he afterward found to his Cost. <HI>Ahab</HI> Unlaw∣fully desir'd, &amp; at last obtain'd <HI>Naboth's</HI> Vine∣yard, as the Event shew'd. And it is spoken of by the Spirit of God, as an instance of the Unjustifiable Usurpation of <HI>Nebuchadnezzar, That whom he would he Slew, and whom he would, he kept Alive; and whom he would he Set up, and whom he would he Put down,</HI> Dan. 5. 19. And were it not thus, there would have been some real Consolation in those words of One<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Anaxarchus.</HI></NOTE> to <HI>Alexander,</HI> designing to Comfort him when Griev'd in Mind that he had Slain <HI>Clytus</HI> in his Debauch; <HI>Regi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ac J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> themin atque Justitiam assidere:</HI> Justice and Judgment always attend GOD and the King in all they do.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Such Laws are given, or Bounds fixed to the Power of Rulers, that is wisely proportion'd to the Ends of Government.</HI> What the design of Go∣vernment is, the Apostle suggests, when he di∣rects us; 1 Tim. 2. 2. <HI>To Pray for Rulers,</HI> (Su∣preme
<PB N="28" REF="001598_0029_0FB3E81E871E4400"/>
&amp; Subordinate) <HI>that under the influence of their Administrations, we may lead Quiet and Peaceable Lives in all Godliness &amp; Honesty.</HI> In which words, he gives us to understand, that the Protection of Persons in the Undisturbed Enjoyment of those two grand Interests, [viz. <HI>Religion &amp; Property</HI>] is the Design or End of it. Rulers are design'd by God to be a Shield &amp; Defence to those under them in their just Rights and Liberty's; such as by the Laws of GOD &amp; their Own (consonant thereto) are settled upon them: And when by their Wise and Prudent Administrations, they Skreen &amp; Protect those under them in these two grand Interests; when their Religion is Secured to them against the Invasions of Error, Profane∣ness and Superstition; and their other just Rights against the Attempts of any whatsoe∣ver: When with <HI>Job</HI> they deliver <HI>the Pour &amp; the Fatherless, &amp; him that hath none to help him,</HI> Job 29. 12. <HI>Break the Jaws of the Wicked, and pluck the Spoil out of his Teeth,</HI> ver. 17. Disappoint all their Unjust &amp; Cruel Designs, so, that none have occasion to complain upon these accounts, then they answer the Design of their Exaltati∣on. Now I say, such Laws are given by God to the Authority of Rulers, that are wisely Suited to these Ends; and when those Limitations are duly observ'd by 'em in their Administrations, 'twill Contribute wholly to further the same.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="001598_0030_0FB3E81FF926C490"/>
Rulers may not do any thing to the Preju∣dice or Hurt of these Interests of a People. This will be Evident, if the true Extent of their Authority, with relation to this Two-fold Object of it be Consider'd.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>As for Mens Civil Rights, as Life, Liberty, Estate,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>God has not Subjected these to the Will &amp; Pleasure of Rulers; nor may they</HI> (either by Secret Practices, or Open Violence) <HI>Invade or Disturb their Free Enjoyment of them.</HI> They may not Enact any Laws to the Prejudice of them, nor Disanul such Laws of the State as tend to Secure these Interests. The whole Power of Legislation is to be Employ'd either in Determining things not Determin'd in the Divine Law, (Natural or Positive) or else a∣bout things already Determin'd in those Laws. And in both Rulers are bound to act and do all things in Subordination (and with due Re∣gard) to those Laws of God, design'd to Se∣cure Persons in the Undisturbed Enjoyment of these things. Tis already Determin'd in the Divine Law (with relation to these In∣terests of a People) that the Enjoyment of them be free &amp; undisturb'd: And Rulers may not make any Determinations repugnant here∣to: Or if they do, they are of no force. No Law of the Civil Magistrate can bind in Op∣position to the Divine. For God when He gives to Men a Power of Legislation, He does
<PB N="30" REF="001598_0031_0FB3E82182D6AB58"/>
it <HI>Cumulative,</HI> (as they say) <HI>non Privative;</HI> not so as to deprive Himself of it. The whole therefore that is left to the Legisla∣tive Powers, with relation to these things, seems to be to Enforce what GOD has already Determined concerning them: By suitable Rewards and Penalty's to endeavour to further &amp; secure Obedience thereto. And as for such things as being indifferent in their own Nature, not already Determin'd in the Law of God, nor by Principles deducible therefrom, altho' they are subject to the De∣termination of Humane Authority, yet all must be done in due Subordination to those Laws of God that have made it a Sin in any to invade these Rights of a People.</P>
<P N="2">2.<HI>In like manner, if the true Extent of the Power of Rulers with relation to that other Interest of a People [I mean,</HI> Religion;] <HI>be Consider'd, 'twill appear so far limited as to be in all Respects wisely adapted to the End before mentioned.</HI> That Religion (Consider'd as Publickly Profess'd in Society's) is a part of the Care &amp; Charge of the Civil Magistrate, none can in reason de∣ny. Tis an old and true Saying, <HI>Ecclesia in Re∣publica, non Respublica in Ecclesia:</HI> The Church is in the State, not the State in the Church. But tho' it be so, it is not subjected to his Ar∣bitrary Will: but here also Humane Authority is laid under wise Regulations. Tis a Power Su∣bordinate
<PB N="31" REF="001598_0032_0FB3E8242AA38AE8"/>
&amp; Dependant, &amp; Regulated by an higher Law. This will appear in a few Hints.</P>
<P>It's not left as a matter of Liberty with Ru∣lers, to determine whether Religion shall be Publickly Profess'd, or God Publickly Wor∣shipp'd, yea or not. Its in their Power to in∣troduce Religion into Society's, and incorpo∣rate it with the Laws of them, which when it is once done, they have not a like Power to discard it again. Even that Heathen Prince <HI>Darius,</HI> Sinned &amp; Transgressed the limits of his Authority, in that Profane part of his De∣cree, Dan. 6. 7,—<HI>That no man should ask any Petition of any God for thirty days.</HI></P>
<P>Neither is it left to the Determination of Rulers, whether due Care be taken by them for the suitable Support of it, yea or not. Tis already determin'd in the Law of God, That they shall do so. This as it has made the Worship of God an indispensible Duty, &amp; De∣termin'd of the several parts of that Worship, and that a certain Order of Men be set apart to that Service, (who shall devote &amp; give them∣selves to it) so likewise, that a suitable Re∣venue be settled upon them. Indeed, there seems not to be any determination in the law of God of any particular Proportion of mens Estates for this end or use. That ancient Law that stated the <HI>Tithe,</HI> seems to be a Law <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on reasons peculiar to the Common-Wealth
<PB N="32" REF="001598_0033_0FB3E82533971B88"/>
of the <HI>Jews</HI> as such; and not upon reasons com∣mon to all Places. The Priests and Levites under the Law, as they made up a considera∣ble part of that People, (ordinarily a Thirti∣eth part, as is observ'd) so much was the pecu∣liar Blessing of God upon their Labours in Tilling the Earth, that the common Returns of it were very great: Sometimes Thirty, some∣times Sixty, &amp; sometimes an Hundred-fold; as may be gather'd from the Parable of the good Ground, in the Gospel. And it being so, it seems unreasonable to extend that Law to other Nations, where those that Ministred in Holy Things bear not that proportion to o∣thers, &amp; the Soyl is not so rich in its Returns.</P>
<P>But tho' it be thus, yet that a suitable Sup∣port be always continu'd to those who Mini∣ster in Sacred Things, the Law of God has de∣termin'd, and that as due by a Natural Equity, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> IX. And to determine otherwise, Ru∣lers are without Power.</P>
<P>Nor yet may Humane Authority Ordain what it pleases in the Worship of God. <HI>Jero∣boam,</HI> (who made <HI>Israel</HI> to Sin) <HI>Ahab, Ahaz</HI> and others who did, so, transgressed the lines of their Authority. As for the Parts or Means of Worship, they are already Determi∣ned &amp; Stated in the Word of God; and from the Obligation of the Second Commandment must be fetch'd and warranted from thence.
<PB N="33" REF="001598_0034_0FB3E826BB8D5898"/>
They may not appoint what Ordinances or Ceremony's they please, in the Worship of God. The same Principles that will Warrant their Appointment of any thing, (tho' in it self never so innocent) will equally bear them out in Introducing the whole Mass of <HI>Romish</HI> Superstition into the Church of God.</P>
<P>Nor finally, may they Usurp the Ministe∣rial Function, and Perform the Acts peculiar thereto. <HI>It appertaineth not to them to burn In∣cense unto the Lord, but to the Priests,</HI> 2 Chron. 26.18. In a word; The Power of Rulers with respect to the Object of it, seems to be reduce∣able to these Heads: They are to see that God be Worshipped; and that the several parts of Worship be attended according to the Rule of the Word, <HI>in Decency and Order:</HI> That the True Doctrine of the Gospel be Taught; and the Sacraments Rightly Admi∣nistred. Tho' they are not (as One<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Stilling fleet.</HI></NOTE> says) <HI>Imperata facere;</HI> yet they are <HI>Imperare facienda.</HI> And see that they are so according to the Or∣der of the Gospel. And a People thus Pro∣fessing the true Religion they are to Protect &amp; Defend: And to Oppose every thing Pub∣lickly tending to the Subversion of it. They are to Secure them against the invasions of A∣theism, Heraesy and Profaness. We have In∣stances
<PB N="34" REF="001598_0035_0FB3E829656EE6A8"/>
of diverse Good Kings, thus Employ∣ing their Power: As <HI>Asa, Jehosaphat, Hezeki∣ah, Josiah,</HI> &amp;c. They stand obliged in these Points, as they are <HI>Custodes &amp; Vindices Legis Divinae.</HI> From all which 'tis Evident, that the Power of Rulers is in all respects suited to the foremention'd design of Government; &amp; that when the proper Limits of it are duely observ'd by them, 'twill Contribute wholly thereto. With <HI>David</HI> they will become <HI>the Feeders of their People; the Shields of the Earth; and Nursing Fathers to the Church, Psal.</HI>78.71,72. &amp; 47.9. <HI>Isa.</HI> 22. &amp; 49. 23.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>It being so, it necessarily follows, that the Rectitude and Success of Government has a great Dependance upon due Care &amp; Caution in this Point.</HI> The Power of Rulers being a Subordinate, Limited Power, and thus wisely suited to the End of Government, all Errors in this parti∣cular, (as in the Defect, so in the Excess) must be very Prejudicial thereto.</P>
<P>IV. <HI>As it lays the most binding Obligations both upon Rulers &amp; Ruled, to be Faithful in their respective Duty's.</HI> There is a Civil Relation between the Rulers and the Ruled; and as all other Relations among Men have peculiar Duty's annex'd to them, so 'tis with this What the Duty of the Ruler is, we have in the general heard. On the part of the Ruled,
<PB N="35" REF="001598_0036_0FB3E82A8EDC9890"/>
there is Honour of Reverence, Tribute and Obedience due. There is a peculiar Respect and Honour due to Rulers: They are styled Dignity's, with reference to the place of Su∣periority they stand in above others: And that Honourable Name they are Dignify'd with [<HI>I said, Ye are Gods:</HI>] And as they are so, so there are peculiar degrees of Deference, and Respect due to them above others. <HI>David</HI> tho' unjustly and cruelly Persecuted by <HI>Saul,</HI> yet because of his Dignity, (he being the Lord's Anointed) one Dignify'd with the Name &amp; Authority of GOD, he shews a peculiar Ho∣nour and Respect to him, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 24.6. Again, Tribute and Obedience to all Lawful Com∣mands, are due from the Ruled: Rom. 13.5,6. <HI>Wherefore ye must needs be Subject, not only for Wrath but also for Conscience sake. For, for this cause Pay you Tribute also: For they are God's Mi∣nisters, attending continually upon this very thing.</HI> And those are styled Children of <HI>Belial,</HI> who bro't no Presents to <HI>Saul,</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 10. 27. The word in the Original, [Mincha,] signifies a Gift, Oblation, or Offering; and is commonly apply'd to the Sacrifices which were offer'd to the Lord. Its rendred also a Present, <HI>Gen.</HI> 32. 13. Which seems to suggest it to be the Duty of the Ruled, not only to Acknowledge them by Paying that Tribute which may Re∣compence their Labours in Government;
<PB N="36" REF="001598_0037_0FB3E82C0847C810"/>
(which is an act of Justice) but moreover to manifest their peculiar Respect, by Presenting them with their Gifts. Now I say, Whatever Duty's belong to this Relation, (whether on the part of the Ruler, or the Ruled) Religion has a distinguishing influence to promote Fi∣delity in them.</P>
<P>As to Rulers, it presents them with the most powerful inducements to Faithfulness. It is no less proper to prevent Errors in the Defect, than in the Excess. Thus it is, as by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> her Means, so particularly by unveiling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Na∣ture of an Oath, and the Solemn Obl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ion it carry's with it. An Oath in general, is a Solemn Invocating GOD to Witness for the Confirmation of the Truth, and Sincerity of what we Say or Promise. Hereby an Emi∣nent Honour is given to God: He is acknow∣ledged as the Author, Lover &amp; Rewarder of Truth; and as one that Sees and Knows all things. It's a part of Natural Worship, and reduceable to the First Commandment of the Law, in regard of the Object Invocated, <HI>viz.</HI> GOD. But in respect of the Reverend Use of it, (or the Name of God in it) so its to be referr'd to the Third Commandment. Tis either Assertory, or Promissory; and as in the former, we do in the most Solemn Manner Call upon God in these (or the like) words, <HI>Let the All-seeing GOD, the Fountain and Au∣thor
<PB N="37" REF="001598_0038_0FB3E82DE5E0DE70"/>
of Truth, that GOD that ponders the Spirits, and is the Righteous Judge of the World, come down and Witness to the Truth of what I Assert; and let Him take Vengeance on me, if I Assert that which is False.</HI> So in like manner, we do in the Promissory Oathes. We Invocate Him in like manner to Witness to the Truth or Since∣rity of our Promises, and Imprecate the like Vengeance upon our selves, in case of In-since∣rity. In every Oath, there is evermore an Imprecation express'd or imply'd. This in short is the Nature of it, as might be shew'd at large. And from hence tis evident, it is a thing of the most Solemn Obligation, and to be inviolably kept, tho' we Sware to our Hurt, <HI>Psal.</HI> 15. 4. And by laying open the Nature of this, and the Solemn Obligation of it, Religion becomes (not only otherwise) Serviceable to Government, but particularly as it promotes Fidelity in Rulers. Again, It is very power∣ful this way, as it gives to and maintains in them, a Rectify'd Sense of their State: That however (in other respects) they are distin∣guished from others, yet in this they stand upon a Level, viz. <HI>That they are liable to Death, and the Consequents of it.</HI> Hereby they will be led often to revolve in their Minds, that they are as liable to Death, and the cruel Ar∣rests of a guilty Conscience in their last Hours, and the dreadful Condemnation of the Judge
<PB N="38" REF="001598_0039_0FB3E82F0AFCD208"/>
at last, as others, in case of Unfaithfulness. It will be often reminding them of that So∣lemn <HI>Memento</HI> of their Mortality which we have, Psal. 82.6,7. <HI>I said, Ye are Gods: but ye shall Die like Men.</HI> In a word; It will be often removing the Vail that is drawn over the in∣visible World, and making those lively repre∣sentations both of the Joys &amp; Horrors of it; which will powerfully incite to such a Deport∣ment of themselves in their Places, that now they may have, &amp; at last share in the Felicity of an Unreproaching Conscience, &amp; be filled with Hope and Confidence toward God.</P>
<P>Again, Religion is equally powerful to pro∣mote Fidelity in the Ruled. It is no less pro∣per to make Good Subjects, than Good Rulers. It is observ'd by the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Machiavell.</HI></NOTE> Historian, of <HI>Numa,</HI> that when advanc'd to Royal Dignity among the <HI>Romans,</HI> and being willing to reduce that then Barbarous People to Civil Obedience, he did by the influence of a False Religion of his own invention, work them to ready Com∣pliance with whatever was design'd by the Senate or Princes. Thereby that Virtue was given to their Determinations, that in all things there was in them a ready compliance. How much more powerful is the True Reli∣gion for this end than any of the Inventions
<PB N="39" REF="001598_0040_0FB3E8307A2D0548"/>
of the Wisest Heathen? It Establishes the Duty of the Ruled upon permanent Principles, &amp; Se∣cures it by the most forcible Considerations.</P>
<P>V. <HI>As it Restrains &amp; Subdues those Lusts that are the Causes of all Irregularity &amp; Unsuccessful∣ness of Government in its Administrations.</HI> Had Man continu'd Loyal to his Maker, retain'd that Image of His that was the Glory &amp; Feli∣city of his Primitive State; as doubtless there would have been Order and Subordination a∣mong Men, (Children being no sooner Born than they are actually under the Authority of their Parents) so the respective Duty's of Su∣periors &amp; Inferiors arising from that Subordi∣nation, would have been grateful &amp; pleasant: the fruits of choice and inclination. There would have been no propensity in either to invade the Rights each of other, nor any re∣luctancy against, nor irregularity in the performance of the respective Duty's incum∣bent on them. They would have been under the Governing influence of those good Princi∣ples which would have disposed every one to a due Observance of his Province, and a chear∣ful &amp; regular discharge of the Duty's belong∣ing thereto. In a word Superiors, Inferiors and Equals had walk'd in sweet Agreement together, and Order and Tranquility had co∣vered the Earth. But since he is stripp'd of
<PB N="40" REF="001598_0041_0FB3E8320A40E890"/>
that Blessed Image, has lost his Primitive Re∣ctitude, and Sin has invaded &amp; taken Possession of his Nature, he is chang'd to Amazement. There is now no good Propensity in him, and he is willingly Subject, and yields a chearful Obedience to the Vilest Lusts and Passions. Tis thus with all Ranks and Degrees of Men whatever. The Rebellion of our Common Parent, was a Sin of Universal Efficacy, &amp; de∣rives a Guilt and Corruption to all Mankind, in all Ages of the World. However Men may be distinguish'd upon other accounts, yet in this Article they agree, <HI>viz.</HI> That an He∣reditary Corruption is thereby diffused into them. Superiors &amp; Inferiors (of what kind soever) in this stand upon a Level. Sin has equally Invaded them, Marr'd the Rectitude of their Faculty's, and Subjected them to the Empire of Lust and Passion. Pride, Envy, Covetousness, Sensuality are Naturally the Guides of our Lives, &amp; to the Dictates of these we are very Obsequious. And from hence (as the proper Fountain) all the Disorder &amp; Confusion in the World takes its rise. Hence tis that the Good Order, Beauty and Tran∣quility of Society's is so often defac'd and di∣sturb'd. That Rulers either neglect their Du∣ty, or fail in the Discharge of it; cast of all Care of those under 'em, or set up a Despotick Power, paramount to all Law, and discard the
<PB N="41" REF="001598_0042_0FB3E833C01C5DB8"/>
Justice (&amp; other Vertues) that should shine out in all their Administrations. And on the other hand, Hence tis that the wisest Admi∣nistrations are many times so Unsuccessful, the Ruled Murmur, refuse Submission to whole∣som Constitutions, and invade the Rights of those that are over them. In a word; From hence Injustice, Oppression, Rebellion, Fraud, Violence, and whatever else in Superiors, In∣feriors or Equals is destructive to the good Order and Tranquility of Society's results &amp; flows. And unless these imperious Lusts be restrain'd or rooted out, there can be neither Rectitude, nor Success in any Civil Admini∣strations. Now, this Fear of God (of all things) is the most Effectual for this end: And whatever Virtue may be in any thing else tending this way, it is deriv'd from hence. This lays the most powerful Restraints upon the Lusts of all, and casts those Blocks in the way to all Sinful Gratifications, which it is hard to surmount or get over: And not only so, but extirpates &amp; roots them out. It not only prevents the Act, but kills the Principle, and implants the contrary Habits. It bridles all those Vicious Propensity's in Men, that are insuperable by other Means, &amp; miraculously Re∣news the Understanding, Will &amp; Affections, the Sources of Action. From all Which its more than Evident, That <HI>Religion</HI> is not only
<PB N="42" REF="001598_0043_0FB3E835D41F7958"/>
Consistent with, but highly Serviceable to Ad∣vance the Ends mention'd in our <HI>Doctrine.</HI></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>USE I. <HI>Hence it follows, that Enemy's to Religion are Enemy's to the State.</HI> 'Twill be readily acknowledg'd by all, That Civil Go∣vernment contributes not a little to the Well-being of Religion. As the Maintenance and Progress of Holiness is the principal Design of God in the Ordination of a Rule over Men, and all other more immediate Ends of it are to be pursued by Rulers as Means subserving to this; so when it is duly Exercised, Rulers have this Noble Design always in View, and all their Administrations are wisely propor∣tion'd to it, it is very Serviceable for these Ends. The Continuance, Growth and Pro∣gress of it has a great dependance upon the Wisdom &amp; Fidelity of Rulers in discharging the Trust reposed in them. This is parti∣cularly true in this Degenerate Day, wherein Impiety, Profaneness, and the Contempt of all that is Sacred and Good have gotten such an Ascendant, and made such Advances in the Christian World, that were they not under this Restraint, they wou'd like <HI>Pharaoh'</HI>s lean K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne, make a quick dispatch of all that is Comely &amp; Good in it. But yet for the Ho∣nour
<PB N="43" REF="001598_0044_0FB3E83752CBA540"/>
of Religion on the other hand, it may be said, That it contributes nothing less to the Well-being of Civil Government: And were it not for this, (most certain it is) there wou'd be little else besides the Name &amp; Sha∣dow of it in the World.</P>
<P>And that this is so, (besides what has been already said) will be further Evident, if we consider, That no Instance can be given of a∣ny Society in the World whereby Govern∣ment is Duly and Successfully Administred, (even so far forth as it relates to the Civil Rights and Immunity's of the Ruled) where it has not the assisting Influence of the true Religion attending of it. The Apostle sug∣gests to us what the State of <HI>Corinth</HI> was be∣fore Christianity was introduc'd among them, in those words of his to the Church there; 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6. 11. Where having enumerated a black Catalogue of the Vilest Enormity's, such as are most inconsistent with the good Order and Tranquility of Civil Society's; As viz. <HI>Uncleanness,</HI> (in the most horrid Instances of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/><HI>Theft, Covetousness, Drunkenness, Reviling, Extortion, &amp;c.</HI> He tells them, <HI>And such were some of you.</HI> And of the <HI>Gentile</HI> World in ge∣neral, the Apostle assures us, that <HI>it is filled with all Unrighteousness, Fornication, Wickedness, Covetousness, Maliciousness, Envy, Murther, De∣bate, Deceit, Malignity, Backbitings,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Rom.</HI>

1. 28, 29. Very agreeable to the dark Cha∣racter which the Psalmist gives of it in his day, <HI>Psal.</HI> 74. 20. Where he tells us, <HI>that the dark Places of the Earth are full of the Habitations of Cruelty.</HI> Injustice, Oppression, Violence are Evils Triumphant there. In such Places Men live Precariously, and hold whatever is Dear &amp; Valuable to them, by no surer Tenure than the volluble Will and Pleasure of those that are able to Destroy them. Their State is much like that of the Fishes in the Sea, and the Beasts in the Wilderness, where the Great∣er devour the Less. The wisest Constituti∣ons without this, are ineffectual to bridle mens Lusts, and hold them within due Limits. It is upon this Ground or Principle, that <HI>Abra∣ham</HI> Infers or Argues as he does in our Text; <HI>Because I said, Truly the Fear of God is not in this Place; and they will Slay me.</HI> Such there∣fore are deservedly to be esteem'd Enemy's to the State, and (in desire at least) Subverters of all that is desirable and good in it, that are Enemy's to Religion. And alas! How many are there of these, even within the Christian Pale? Some are Professedly and Openly so: The present Degenerate Age affords many of these Monsters. They talk of it as a Dream, openly Defy it, and treat all those with Scorn that make Profession of it. Others, altho' they mask themselves with a Form of Godli∣ness,
<PB N="45" REF="001598_0046_0FB3E83A55D58DC8"/>
&amp; make specious Shews of it to carry on their Carnal Designs, yet as they are without the Power of it; so Enemy's to it in their Hearts, and tho' not Openly, yet Secretly (&amp; as far as will stand with the preservation of their Interest and Honour) seek the Ruine of it. And are there not many of these even a∣mong us? The things which are designed by God to implant His Fear in the Hearts of Sinners, and to be as Food to Support &amp; Nou∣rish it there, (I mean, the Publick, Instituted Worship of the Gospel, which is design'd by God for these good Designs) they are Ene∣my's to, and wish in their Hearts there were no such thing. And moreover, This sort of men are not only to be found among the more Base and Vile among us, but even among such as would hold a place among those of Rank and Quality. I think I am not too severe in this Censure; especially considering there are in many among us, those things which will not (unless we impose upon our Reason) allow of a more favourable Construction.</P>
<P>But surely these Men are far removed from right Thot's of things, and however they may think themselves not a little Skill'd in <HI>Politicks,</HI> &amp; have liberal Tho'ts of their own <HI>Wisdom,</HI> yet surely <HI>Wisdom will never Die with them.</HI> They little know what the amazing Consequents of their Desires (<HI>cou'd they obtain 'em</HI>) wou'd be.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="001598_0047_0FB3E83BC85C2300"/>
USE II. <HI>Hence it follows likewise, That the Decay of Religion, is a sure Sign of a Decaying State.</HI> It being of such Influence to Pro∣mote the Weal and Prosperity of the State (as has been shew'd) it must needs follow, that the Decay of it must be a Presage of Ru∣ine thereto. Its asserted by a great Politici∣an,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Machiavell.</HI></NOTE> That the Religion introduc'd by <HI>Numa</HI> among the <HI>Romans,</HI> (tho' it was no other than the Product of his own Brain) was one of the prime Causes of their Felicity and Grandure. For this (<HI>says he</HI>) produc'd Good Laws, Good Laws, Good Fortune, and Good Fortune a Good End in whatever they undertook. And from hence says of the True Religion, That as there is nothing Contributes more to the Advancement of a State than that, so nothing that more certainly bodes Ruine thereto than the Dying, Decaying State of it. Conso∣nant to this, we find this mention'd, as one of <HI>Ephraim'</HI>s Gray Hairs; Hos. 7.9, 10. <HI>Stran∣gers have devoured his Strength, and he knoweth it not: Yea, Gray Hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not. And the Pride of</HI> Israel <HI> testifieth to his Face, and they do not return to the Lord their God, nor seek Him for all this.</HI> And tho' possibly there may be many here present
<PB N="47" REF="001598_0048_0FB3E83D53236DE8"/>
who will not believe me, yet let me tell you, There is nothing has a darker Aspect upon our Civil Liberty's, and more Threatens the Ruine and Loss of all, than the Languishing State of Religion among us. It is observ'd by the Person but now mention'd, (and cer∣tainly its an Observation worthy of our seri∣ous Remark) That however a People Dege∣nerate and Corrupted may possibly recover their Liberty's when lost, yet when they have done so, they are not likely long to maintain them. And to evidence this tells us, That the <HI>Romans</HI> having expell'd the <HI>Tarquins</HI> (who cruelly invaded their Liberty's) quickly re∣cover'd them again, and maintain'd them for a long time. Whereas afterward, when the whole Race of the <HI>Caesars</HI> were destroy'd, they could not introduce the least shadow or ap∣pearance of Liberty among them: The reason of which difference in the same People (<HI>he tells us</HI>) was, because in the time of the former Kings they were not so generally Corrupted, as afterwards. Universal Spiritual Thral∣dom in Society's, is inconsistent with Civil Liberty: When once Irreligion &amp; Profaness get the Ascendant in them, &amp; a general Cor∣ruption of mens Principles and Morals pre∣vails, this will soon put all things out of Joynt, and bring a Deluge of Misery's with it.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="001598_0049_0FB3E83EC8EDF320"/>
USE III. <HI>Is Religion thus Serviceable to these good Designs? then all Means design'd and proper to Secure and Advance it among us, should be very Valuable and Precious in our Eyes: And due care should be taken to Countenance and En∣courage them, as things on which our Civil Weal does not a little depend.</HI> Of this Nature is the Publick Worship of God, which as it is de∣sign'd for, so very proper to Inchoate, Pro∣pagate and Increase the Spiritual Life in the Soul. The Word of God therein dispensed has an Objective Vertue in it, whereby its apt and proper not only to Regenerate, but to Encrease the Vigour &amp; Activity of the New Life:—<HI>To build us up to an Inheritance among all them which are Sanctify'd,</HI> Act. 20. 32.</P>
<P>Again, All prope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Methods for the due E∣ducation of Youth, and their Improvement in Knowledge, Piety and Vertue. It's observ'd by the Historian<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Howell.</HI></NOTE> of <HI>Julian,</HI> That after his A∣postasy from our Holy Religion, (being an Enemy to it, and resolv'd to Suppress it if Possible;) One method improv'd by him for that end, was, his shutting up all Schools of Learning, and forbidding to Christians the Liberty of instructing their Youth in the Li∣beral Arts and Sciences, Jesting away the rea∣son
<PB N="49" REF="001598_0050_0FB3E84181069E78"/>
of this Injustice with Scoffs, as he did the rest; saying, <HI>That since</HI> Plato, Aristotle <HI>and</HI> I∣socrates, <HI>Ador'd</HI> Mercury <HI>and the other Gods, he held it absurd, that the</HI> Christians <HI>should learn from their Books whose Religion they Condemn'd and Loath'd.</HI> And certainly this was a pro∣per Mean for the End to which it was De∣sign'd.</P>
<P>And the Encouragement of these things, as it is especially incumbent on Rulers, who are design'd by God to be the Physicians of the Body Politick, both to Cure and Prevent the growth of any hurtful Distempers in it, so when they are duly careful in their Admini∣strations so to do, what we have heard neces∣sitates us to look upon it as a Token for Good unto a People.</P>
<P>USE IV. <HI>Our Text and Doctrine suggests to as who those are that are most meet to be Employ'd in Places of Rule over a People.</HI> That they are such who are themselves under the Govern∣ing influence of this Fear of GOD, and Con∣sequently will be most industrious in Endea∣vours that others may be so; and take due care to proportion &amp; suit the whole of their Conduct to this good Design. Accordingly the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e are the Persons we are directed in the Word of God to make Choice of for this end, <HI>Exod,</HI> 18. 21. 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 23. 3.</P>

But I shall Conclude with a word of EXHORTATION, directed to the several Or∣ders of Persons here Present, to contribute and do what they can in their several Places to Secure and Advance this Interest among us. And here,</P>
<P>I. In the first Place; Let this word of Ad∣vice (with all due Submission) be directed to the Honourable the GOVERNOUR, the DEPUTY GOVERNOUR, with the Worshipful ASSISTANTS of this Colony. <HI>Honourable and Worshipful;</HI> What has been said necessitates a tho't of Religion as a thing most Serviceable to the designs of Govern∣ment, and to Conclude that the most advan∣tagious Forms of it (tho' manag'd by the most Refin'd Politicks) are not likely to Suc∣ceed without this; and that the Civil Inte∣rests of a People are not a little imbark'd on this Bottom. Whatever Sentiments the brutish, insensible part of Mankind may have of it; whose Eyes Lust has vailed and far re∣mov'd them from right tho'ts of things; tho' they may look upon it as a thing Serviceable only to advance the Separate Interests of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Persons; yet I doubt not of the Concur∣rence of all those in this Opinion concerning it, whose Minds are not utterly depraved, and who are not themselves Strangers to those

powerful influences of it, by which it becomes <HI>thus Serviceable</HI> to promote the <HI>Publick Good.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In Particular,</HI> There is no reason to believe but that your Selves are very sensible of this Truth, do look upon <HI>Religion</HI> as a Main Pillar by which the Common-Wealth is Supported, and that the Fall &amp; Ruine of this among us, will bring an Amazing Destruction upon all our Civil Interests. You are not insensible, how necessary this is for all Persons of what Character or Station soever; and that with∣out the influences of it, none are likely to ap∣prove themselves in any Relation. Which being so, (as Religion may well claim a par∣ticular Regard from YOU, and that the inte∣rest of it have a Governing Influence upon <HI>You</HI> in all your Councils and Administrations, so) we are encouraged to hope and beseech You, that in the whole of your Conduct, You would make it manifest, that it is a Thing that lies very near Your Hearts; that you are particu∣larly Concern'd for it; and this by Uniting your best Endeavours to Secure and Perpetu∣ate this Interest among us, and Rescue it from the sad Decay's which at present it is under.</P>
<P>You are not insensible, how well a distin∣guishing Zeal for this Cause of GOD among us, will become your Exalted Station. That nothing will better Entitle you to the Ho∣nourable Stile of <HI>Gods,</HI> (which you bear)

render you more Venerable, so much Establish your Authority, Secure the due Respect and Obedience of those over whom you are set; and help you to attain and answer the grand Design of HIM by whom you Rule, in put∣ting Honour upon you. This was that which rendred <HI>Job</HI> so Venerable in his day; <HI>That when he passed thro' the City, and prepared his Seat in the Street, the Young men that saw him hid them∣selves, &amp; the Aged arose and stood up; the Princes refrained talking, and the Nobles held their peace in his Presence.</HI> 'Tis apparent to every one whose Eyes are not utterly closed, that <HI>Reli∣gion</HI> sadly Languishes among us. How small is the Number of Painful, Practical Christi∣ans, that shew forth the Power of Godliness in their Lives? Nothing is more apparent than that, the Religion of the Body (even) of Professors among us is sunk into a Lifeless Formality: And that there are but very few in whom there is any thing to be seen of that Good Spirit that follow'd God into this Wil∣derness. The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> describing to <HI>Ti∣mothy,</HI> 2 Tim. III. those Perilous Times which he there assures him should overtake the Church before the end, gives him a black List of the Evils which (he assures him) should then be prevalent among Professors them∣selves, <HI>ver.</HI>—6. Certainly this heavy Prophecy is to a sad degree fulfilled in our Days, these
<PB N="53" REF="001598_0054_0FB3E84877474690"/>
Perilous Times are far advanc'd upon us, the Spirit and Temper of the generality of men among us is drawn to the Life in those Verses. Now it being so, and the Reforming growing Evils belonging to your Province, You will give me leave, Humbly to Call upon you to bestir your Selves in this matter; and as the Eminency of your Station gives you singular Advantages, so that you would Apply your Selves hereto. May I not say to you, as <HI>Mor∣decai</HI> to <HI>Esther,</HI> upon another Occasion; <HI>Who knows whether God has not raised you for such a Time as this?</HI> Be sure this is what God expects from you in the present Day &amp; Season. You are not insensible, of the Worthy's Recorded in Scripture, who have gone before you in this Work; who by a Zealous asserting the Cause of GOD in Degenerate Times, &amp; dispensing a Vigorous Influence to the Suppressing growing Evils, have added to that Crown that is now plac'd on their Heads. Not to mention others, <HI>Nehemiah</HI> Signaliz'd himself in this Work. The Holy Spirit gives us this account of him, viz. <HI>That he was a man sent to seek the Welfare of the Children of</HI> Israel. This was the design of his Mission and coming among them: And this with unwearied Applications he pursued and failed not to answer. And this he did, (as by other means, so particularly) by Stemming the Tide of Profaneness, &amp; Reforming grow∣ing
<PB N="54" REF="001598_0055_0FB3E84930E77C48"/>
Evils among them. I may add further, (what you very well know) That the Obli∣gation you lie under to the Civil Interests of this People (simply Consider'd) is not the only thing urging this Duty upon you; but there are other Motives of a Nobler Extracti∣on, which (because your Wisdom suggests them to you) I forbear to mention.</P>
<P><HI>In a Word;</HI> It is said of that excellent Em∣peror <HI>Constantine,</HI> that he was wont to stile himself,[<HI>Episcopos Pros▪ Ta He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o,</HI>] <HI>A Bishop or Overseer of Religion.</HI> An Overseer to Prevent and Rectify all Visible Disorders therein, Defending the same, and to Establish proper Methods for the Continuance and Growth of it. We trust you will give us rea∣son to Conclude you have the same Sentiments concerning your Selves, and that by a due Concern of your Selves in the matter now ur∣ged. And thus doing you will yet further Entitle your Selves to the incessant Cry's of all that Love GOD, That He would be with you in your Work, Counsel and Strengthen you in it, and Think upon you for Good ac∣cording to all that you have done, or may do for this People, <HI>Neh.</HI> 5. <HI>ult.</HI></P>

Unacceptable to you, to be put in mind of what you know to be our common Duty; and that you will suffer the word of Exhortation. <HI>Religion</HI> being a thing of such Benign Influ∣ence upon the Civil Concerns of all Society's, it ly's indispensibly upon us also to bestir our Selves, imploy all our Talents, and unite our best Endeavours to further this Good Design. As our Rank and Station in the World, and the peculiar Influence which we may reaso∣nably <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> suppos'd to have upon all Persons of what Character soever, gives us peculiar Ad∣vantages to Contribute to this good design more than some others; so that Zeal for God which is but justly expected in us in some de∣grees of Eminence, should effectually engage us in it. If we consider our selves in our Ci∣vil Capacity, as Members of the State, who expect Protection from the Laws of it, and to share in the Happiness arising from the good Order, Peace and Prosperity of it, so we stand bound to this Duty; but if we consider our selves as <HI>the Ministers of CHRIST,</HI> who by Office are Co-workers with Him in the Con∣cerns of His Royal &amp; Prophetick Offices, &amp; by a solemn Consecration have been set apart thereto; the strict Charge we lie under, to be Faithful in our Work, &amp; the solemn Account which in a very <HI>short Time</HI> we must give of our Stewardships, tis evident we lie under pecu∣liar

Bonds, the highest Obligations imaginable, to rouse &amp; stir up our selves, &amp; with utmost Ap∣plication to engage in this affair. Certainly, there never was a day wherein there was great∣er need of Zeal &amp; Warmth in this affair, than in the present; wherein even the vilest Enor∣mity's have establish'd a Reputation in the World, are Legitimated by common Practice, have lost that Fear &amp; Shame that was wont to attend 'em, walk in the day-light; and as its wont to be said, <HI>Non querunt angulos.</HI> And it be∣ing so, shall we shut our Eyes, &amp; fold our Hands? And that we may be Successful Instruments, and really Contribute to this good design, suffer me here in a few Hints.</P>
<P>Let us often endeavour to recommend <HI>Reli∣gion</HI> to the Reason &amp; Consciences of our Hear∣ers. Religion <HI>is a reasonable Service,</HI> Rom. 12. 1. The Faith &amp; Observance of which it consists, are both grounded on the <HI>highest Reason.</HI> Faith in assenting to the <HI>Doctrines</HI> of it, proceeds upon rational grounds; and all the <HI>Duty's</HI> of it are most equal &amp; just. Let us make it a principal part of our Work, to impress a sense of this. Let us not account it eno' to make Addresses to the <HI>Affections</HI> of our Hearers; this is but to Storm the Out-works, &amp; leave the main Strong-holds of Sin Untouch'd. The impressions made on the <HI>Affections,</HI> are easily ras'd out; whereas <HI>due Conviction of the reasonableness of Re∣ligion,</HI>
<PB N="57" REF="001598_0058_0FB3E84DC49AAA48"/>
will abide with &amp; have a permanent In∣fluence upon them.</P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> Let us often set before them the <HI>Pre∣sent &amp; Future World,</HI> so vastly different in their Quality's, the kind &amp; duration of the Good &amp; Evil things of them. This is a proper Mean to wound the interest of Sin at the heart, dis∣cover to Sinners the Folly of their Choice be∣fore they come to their end, &amp; by sad expe∣rience shall be convinc'd thereof. Tis a con∣siderable part of our work, to set these things before Sinners in a true light: To unmask the Present World, and remove the Vail that is drawn over the Future &amp; Invisible; and make lively discover<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the vast disparity between the Good and Evil things of Each.</P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> Let a due Zeal appear in all <HI>our Admi∣nistrations:</HI> Particularly in dispensing the Word of Life. As we shou'd therein appear <HI>Shining,</HI> so no less <HI>Burning Lights:</HI> And to this end, let us la∣bour our selves to have a sense &amp; feeling of the Truths we deliver. This will enable us in a suitable manner to apply our selves to <HI>our Hear∣ers</HI> &amp; very much further our Success therein. <HI>Tis the Mind that convinces the Mind, &amp; the Heart perswades the Heart.</HI> He that speaks from a Sa∣cred fire in his own bosom, will inflame others.</P>
<P><HI>Further,</HI> Let us as far as is possible, give our selves to <HI>our Work.</HI> Suffer that Address of <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Timothy;</HI> 1 Tim 4. 13. <HI>Give attendance to Read∣ing,
<PB N="58" REF="001598_0059_0FB3E84F518DA318"/>
to Exhortation, to Doctrine.</HI> Indeed, such are the Circumstances of many of us, that en∣tire applications to our work are impossible: Yet are all of us guiltless in this Point? Are we as far as we may devoted to our work, and not needlesly turn'd aside from it? Oh! Let us make it appear in the whole of our Conduct that the <HI>Saving of Souls is our principal aim.</HI> No∣thing short of this, will be a sufficient Justifica∣tion before the enlightned Tribunal of our JUDGE at last.</P>
<P><HI>Finally,</HI> Give me leave further to add, That due strictness in the Trial of <HI>Candidates for the Ministry,</HI> and Care that none but such whose merits recommend thereto, be admitted into the <HI>Pulpit,</HI> will doubtless contribute well to this good design. Tis a part of that <HI>Solemn Charge</HI> that lies upon us as Ministers, <HI>That we lay Hands suddenly on no man.</HI> And consequently, that care be taken that the way of Persons admis∣sion into the <HI>Pulpit</HI> be not too wide and easy. And most certain it is, that as a worthy Mi∣nistry is the only Means (<HI>since Miracles are ceased</HI>) to Maintain &amp; Propagate true Religi∣on, so due strictness in the Examination of Persons for &amp; Admission of them to the Mi∣nistry, is the most proper means imagi∣nable for the attaining such a Blessing.</P>
<P>In a word▪ Let us labour in all respects to be Faithful, and <HI>Fulfil the Ministry we have re∣ceived
<PB N="59" REF="001598_0060_0FB3E850C1F455F0"/>
of the Lord.</HI> So only may we hope here to enjoy the Peace &amp; Comfort resulting from an Unreproaching Conscience, and hereafter (<HI>when the great Shepherd of the Sheep shall appear</HI>) to receive a Crown of Glory that fades not a∣way.</P>
<P>III. I shall now Direct my self to such Gentlemen as are here present, the REPRE∣SENTATIVES of this Colony. Such are our Circumstances under the present Consti∣tution, (which thro' the indulgent Providence of GOD, &amp; the Royal Favour is yet continu'd) that the Welfare of Christianity has a great dependance upon your suitable Discharge of the Trust Reposed in you. And as you are now met together, to Consult &amp; Do such things as to your Wisdom shall appear to have a ten∣dency to the Welfare of this People, so 'tis to be hoped, that what has now been said may so far obtain in you, that you will allow <HI>Religion</HI> a share in your Consultations, manifest a due Concern for the Languishing State of it among us, and chearfully Concur to establish all Me∣thods proper for the Recovery thereof. It can't be deny'd, that worthy Deeds have been done (for this end) by those in whose Hands the <HI>Legislative Power</HI> has been lodg'd among us: Yet in as much as notwithstanding what has been heretofore done of that Nature, this Interest continues still to Languish among us,
<PB N="60" REF="001598_0061_0FB3E8523996C088"/>
tis evident that you are call'd to make a fur∣ther Essay in that matter.</P>
<P>Where the Methods Establish'd among a People to prevent a growing Apostacy, and to secure and advance the Cause of God among them, are apparently Ineffectual, (whether it be thro' the manifest Unsuitableness of those Methods for this end, or thro' Defect in the Prosecution of them) there ly's an indispensi∣ble Obligation upon <HI>Rulers</HI> to take these things into their <HI>Consideration,</HI> &amp; to endeavour to <HI>Recti∣fy</HI> or <HI>Mend</HI> what is wanting or amiss in them.</P>
<P>It is an excellent piece of Advice (&amp; very necessary to be observ'd by all Persons how∣ever imploy'd) which the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> gives, 1 Thes. 4. 11. <HI>Study—to do your own Business.</HI> None should go beyond their Line, &amp; meddle with things foreign to their Province. Yet I think I shall not exceed the Bounds of my Commission, nor incur the Censure of any that are Wise, if I tell you, that it is not a matter of Liberty whether you will take this matter into your serious Consideration, and make a Trial what may be done in it, yea or not. Such is the State of Religion among us, &amp; such Vio∣lent Symptoms appear upon it, that nothing is more evident, than that if a Remedy be not speedily Apply'd, the Disease will be past Cure. Certainly, This is an Interest so Valuable, as to deserve your most deliberate Tho't &amp; Care for
<PB N="61" REF="001598_0062_0FB3E853C69E84E0"/>
the Securing of it. There needs no more to beget in any a Veneration of it, than impar∣tially to View it. Its own internal Excellen∣cy's are sufficient to recommend it to every impartial eye; and (which seems to be <HI>Peculiar to Christianity</HI>) it may be further said to the Praise of it; <HI>That the more we Know, proportio∣nably greater will our Veneration be.</HI> To Con∣clude this particular, Let me tell you, That from what we have heard tis very evident, that you can't be Faithful in your <HI>Trust,</HI> &amp; duly assert &amp; seek to Maintain the <HI>Civil Interests</HI> of this People whom you Represent, in a Neglect of the Advice now given. <HI>In a word;</HI> When the Ways of God are Deserted, and Religion runs Low among a People, this is a time where∣in any Service we do for it, is peculiarly Ac∣ceptable to God. As a Prince Dethron'd by his Subjects, retains a most tender Affection for those who continue Loyal to him in the gene∣ral Revolt, &amp; seek to Re-inthrone him again: So we may reasonably Conclude, that GOD will ever regard those with a <HI>Peculiar Goodness,</HI> that stand for Him in Declining Times and to their Utmost endeavour to retrieve His in∣jur'd Honour and Interest. I shall take the Liberty here of Suggesting a word or two.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Let the Inferiour Posts &amp; Stations in the Go∣vernment, be fill'd with Men of Zeal &amp; Piety.</HI> As the determination of the Persons who shall be
<PB N="62" REF="001598_0063_0FB3E85533668DD8"/>
imploy'd in Subordinate Places of Trust in the Government, is much in your Power, so the Interest of Religion ought to have a Go∣verning Influence upon you in the Manage∣ment of that part of <HI>your Trust,</HI> and <HI>your Coun∣sels and Determinations</HI> in that matter, should be manag'd with particular Regards thereto. <HI>'Jethro'</HI>s Advice to <HI>Moses,</HI> is Obligatory as to all Ranks or Degrees of Rulers Supreme or Su∣bordinate. And whatever Good Establish∣ments have been made, or now, or hereafter may be, for the Service of this interest among us, yet if the Prosecution of them be intrusted in the hands of Persons void of these <HI>Qualifi∣cations,</HI> they are never likely to do any Good. <HI>A Sword in a Coward's hand will never Atchieve any thing, nor yet in the hands of one that is utter∣ly averse to the Use of it.</HI> Common Reason will dictate to every man, that as for such as are so far under the influence of Sense, as to be false to their own Souls (<HI>that choicest Depositum</HI>) in the everlasting Concerns of them, will not scruple to Betray a more <HI>Publick Trust</HI> that may be Reposed in them. Where these Divine Qualifications are in Persons, they will inevi∣tably produce a dear Concern that this Inte∣rest may Flourish, and a Vigorous Prosecution of all Methods proper for that end; but where they are wanting, there will be a wretched in∣differency of Spirit with respect thereto, and
<PB N="63" REF="001598_0064_0FB3E856B3E67020"/>
whatever distinguishing Advantages such Per∣sons may enjoy to be Serviceable to this Inte∣rest, yet they will never improve them. Let the interest of <HI>Religion</HI> therefore have a Go∣verning influence in the Management of this Affair; lay aside all <HI>Affection, Interest,</HI> and those <HI>Sinister Views</HI> (which possibly may sometimes have too much influenc'd herein) and let <HI>Re∣ligion</HI> be your Guide &amp; Counsellor therein.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Such an, Establishment for the Support of the Gospel, as might make Ministers in general to give themselves to their Work; and Settle the Worship of God in New Plantations, and such Settlements in Towns as lie remote from the place of Publick Wor∣ship, and can't (without intolerable difficulty) at∣tend upon it; would doubtless Contribute well to this good Design.</HI> I must Confess, I was at a stand with my self, whether I had best recommend this Particular, yea or not; knowing how Un∣acceptable any thing of this Nature is to ma∣ny; and being sure of not escaping a Censure for it: However, if a solemn Declaration that the interest of <HI>Religion</HI> is the main thing influ∣encing hereto, will excuse me from it; I can freely make it. I plead not for the <HI>Wealth &amp; Grandure of those in the Ministry.</HI> They are men of the same Make with others, and with them liable to be Corrupted by these things. And doubtless it was not without reason that it was said of old, <HI>That when the Chalices were
<PB N="64" REF="001598_0065_0FB3E8584AA3C910"/>
of Wood, the Priests were of Gold; but when the Cha∣lices grew to be of Gold, the Priests became Wooden.</HI> But yet, such a Support of the Ministry as may enable them to live separate from the World, &amp; devoted to their Work, is of absolute neces∣sity to the design of their Office. And most certain it is, <HI>That however the present Method E∣stablish'd for this End among us, may secure such Incomes to some Ministers as that they are happily advantag'd to give themselves to Contemplation; yet as for others, they are left under miserable Cir∣cumstances, &amp; that without remedy, by any thing as yet done for this End among us.</HI> Tis the solemn Charge of <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Timothy;</HI> and in him to us all, wherever disposed of by the Divine Provi∣dence, 1 Tim. 4. 14,15. <HI>Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by Prophecy, with the laying on of the Hands of the Presbytery. Medi∣tate upon these things, give thy self wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.</HI> This Charge ly's in common upon us all: But with how many is this impossible? I know no reason to believe, but that the generality of those in the Ministry among us, would esteem it an happi∣ness to be devoted to their Work; but with many of us this is impossible. As we are not Statues without Souls, so neither Angels with∣out Body's: We are compounded of Flesh &amp; Spirit as well as others, live the same Animal life, &amp; are incident to the same common Infir∣mity's
<PB N="65" REF="001598_0066_0FB3E859B216C8D0"/>
&amp; Necessity's. We would (<HI>were it in our power</HI>) joyfully give our selves to <HI>Reading and Meditation,</HI> that our Understandings being en∣rich'd with <HI>Spiritual Knowledge,</HI> we might (as good Housholders) bring forth of our Trea∣sury <HI>things New &amp; Old, and be able to hold fast the sound form of Words,</HI> as becomes those, who are the Depository's of the Sacred Truths of the Gospel, to be: But we can't do it. We would carry into the Sanctuary with us, &amp; there en∣tertain our Hearers with Discourses <HI>Pertinent, Clear, Distinct, Nervous &amp; Well-Labour'd,</HI> like the <HI>Well-beaten Oyl of the Sanctuary;</HI> we would Vi∣sit our Flocks, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> But we can't do it: Our Places are poor, &amp; not able to Subsist us; and our <HI>own Hands are forc'd to minister to our Ne∣cessity's.</HI> And hereby (besides a Thousand o∣ther Inconveniency's of a lesser nature) the Cause of God suffers, beyond what it is easy to conceive of. Ministers are compar'd to the <HI>Luminary's of Heaven,</HI> that by their <HI>Light, Heat and Influences,</HI> are so Beneficial to this <HI>Lower World.</HI> The Metaphor points out to us the grand designs of their <HI>Office;</HI> that it is to im∣part <HI>Light, Heat &amp; Influence</HI> to others: But if they are <HI>Clouded with ignorance,</HI> or <HI>Eclipsed by the interposition of Earthly things,</HI> they must be∣come (at least comparitively) <HI>Useless</HI> and not capable to promote these good designs of their <HI>Office,</HI> as otherwise they might be▪ And
<PB N="66" REF="001598_0067_0FB3E85B46CD5D10"/>
is not this like to be the case of many of us, &amp; this the inevitable effect of the present Me∣thod establish'd among us for the Support of the Ministry? Its Observ'd by an Excellent Historian,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bishop <HI>Burnett.</HI></NOTE> concerning the <HI>Greek</HI> Churches, <HI>That when once the Emperors of the</HI> East <HI>took the Nomination of persons for the Ministry into their own Hands, &amp; preferr'd the Illiterate &amp; Unaccom∣plish'd thereto, those Churches were soon bro't to that pass for Ignorance &amp; Corruption, that it is no wonder that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> given up by God to such terrible Ca∣lamity's as were bro't upon them, first by the</HI> Sara∣cens▪ <HI>and afterward by the</HI> Ottoman <HI>Family.</HI> Verily, we seem at present to be in imminent danger of the same infelicity: GOD grant it may not have the like issue. Most certain it is, that such is the Extent &amp; Difficulty of the <HI>Mi∣nisterial Work,</HI> that when our whole Time is de∣voted to it, the best of us <HI>fall short.</HI> I shall con∣clude my Discourse <HI>on this Head,</HI> with the words of a great Divine<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Bates.</HI></NOTE> on that but now <HI>mention'd</HI> Charge of <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Timothy; If</HI> Timothy <HI>(says he) who had Supernatural Gifts by Inspiration, was oblig'd to be intent &amp; diligent in the application of his mind to the Mystery's of Godliness, how much more should those be so, who must acquire knowledge by Search and Industry, &amp; the Divine Blessing upon it? As (says he) Fountains (by secret Passages) derive from the Sea, the waters that flow in their Streams, so Ministers
<PB N="67" REF="001598_0068_0FB3E85CD24619C0"/>
by Reading, Contemplation and Prayer in their Re∣tirements, obtain the knowledge of Divine Things which they convey in their Sermons to their Hearers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> The <HI>present Method</HI> establish'd among us for this end, leaves <HI>New Plantations</HI> (that are unable themselves to Support the Worship of God) &amp; <HI>such Settlements in Towns</HI> as are remote from the Place of <HI>Publick Worship,</HI> and can't without intolerable difficulty attend upon it, under a sad necessity of being without it. No provision is hereby made for the <HI>Dispensation of the Word of Life to them,</HI> &amp; they must be with∣out it, unless the Blessed Spirit (<HI>from above</HI>) will Descend &amp; Minister to them. And how Deplorable the <HI>State of Religion</HI> already is in some such Places, there are others here that know as well as I. Which being so, there is little reason to hope that things will be better with us, Religion secur'd &amp; recover'd from its present decayed State, unless some more ge∣nuine Method be Establish'd for this end.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>You will show your Fidelity &amp; Zeal in this good design, by imploying your Wisdom in devising some proper Methods to give Force &amp; Virtue to the Laws design'd to restrain Vice &amp; Immorality; and par∣ticularly that of Excess or Intemperance among us.</HI> How wretchedly is the <HI>Force of the Laws evaded,</HI> that are <HI>designed for this end;</HI> &amp; how little <HI>Care taken in most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> by those who should see 'em put in Execution, that they are so?

that notwithstanding them, we are still in im∣minent danger of being Delug'd with Intem∣perance. <HI>Is there no Balm in</HI> Gilead? <HI>Is there no Physician there?</HI> May not this <HI>Honourable Court</HI> find out an Expedient (<HI>if not to cure, yet at least</HI>) to stop the progress of <HI>this spreading Contagion?</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. To Conclude, <HI>Let this word of Exhortation be acceptable to us all; and let us all (in our seve∣ral Places) Contribute what we can to this Good Design.</HI> Were it proper for me here to Address you, as those who have an aversion to <HI>Re∣ligion</HI> by shewing you, that its no ways contra∣ry to <HI>Reason;</HI> that it is truly <HI>Great &amp; Venerable, Amiable and Lovely▪</HI> and by offering <HI>Arguments Demonstrative</HI> of the <HI>truth</HI> of it, yet <HI>time</HI> would not allow of such an <HI>Essay.</HI> Besides what Con∣siderations might be offer'd from <HI>Religion</HI> (sim∣ply consider'd) to perswade to this <HI>Duty,</HI> what we have now heard, furnishes us with Argu∣ments hereto, drawn from another Fountain. We are a people very tender of our <HI>Civil Inte∣rests,</HI> &amp; jealous lest by any means they are in∣vaded or taken from us. And surely in this we err not; they are things <HI>deserving</HI> our most <HI>tender regard:</HI> Yet most certain it is (<HI>and what we have heard may Convince us of it</HI>) that the Continuance of these things has a great depen∣dance upon the <HI>success</HI> of the <HI>Counsel</HI> now given; and that unless we stir up our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> &amp; do what we can to secure &amp; recover <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>among us,</HI> we

shall but vainly attempt by other means to <HI>se∣cure</HI> these things.

This will bring a quick &amp; an amazing de∣struction upon whatever is <HI>beautiful</HI> &amp; <HI>desirable</HI> among us, &amp; our <HI>Land</HI> will soon deserve the <HI>dark Character</HI> given by the <HI>Psalmist</HI> to the <HI>Gentile</HI> World: <HI>'Twill be full of the habitations of Cruelty.</HI> If we utterly Degenerate, we shall not Dege∣nerate into a <HI>Moral Heathenism,</HI> but <HI>something much worse.</HI> In a word, Have we not <HI>loud Calls in Providence,</HI> to bestir our selves in this affair▪ What else (<HI>but that we might be stirred up to strengthen among us the things that Languish &amp; are even ready to Die</HI>) is the design of those <HI>repeated Rebukes we have been under?</HI> The <HI>Psalmist</HI> speak∣ing of the Works of God in Common Provi∣dence, says of them, <HI>Psal.</HI> 107. ult. <HI>Whoso wisely observes them, will understand the Loving Kindness of the Lord.</HI> In this as a <HI>Glass</HI> we may see the Bounty &amp; Goodness of God.
