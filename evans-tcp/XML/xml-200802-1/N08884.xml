<HEAD>TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the eager welcome with which the former series of this incomparable lady's literary correspondence was re∣ceived by the public, there is no room to doubt whether her poems, with the additional volume of her letters, will meet with a favourable reception.</P>
<P>Ever lively, witty, easy, sensible, and elevated above the common level of female capacities and female modes and forms,—nothing dull, nothing insipid or unentertaining, could possibly fall from her pen. She was a philosopher in sentiment, a moralist in pleasure, and a voluptuary in taste: in sex a woman, in understanding a man. Pope gained nothing by his quarrel with this Amazon in wit; who, in return for some ill-natur'd insinuations thrown at her, gave him the severest poetical chastisement he ever received.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>ANECDOTE OF LADY MONTAGUE AND MR. POPE.</HEAD>
<P>—BY the publication of this lady's elegant let∣ters, written during her travels in Europe, Asia and Africa, her name, her wit, her abilities and fame, have been particularly distinguished in the polite circle of sen∣timental entertainment—Elevated above the precision of pru∣dery and the little arts of hypocrisy, with which the weakest and least virtuous of her sex are often masked, she had an at∣tack made on her reputation by an infamous story—
<Q><L>[On eagles wings immortal scandals fly,</L>
<L>While virtuous actions are but born and die.]</L></Q>
as void of probability as any to be met with in the unbounded <HI>range</HI> of <HI>romance,</HI> at first fabricated and industriously propa∣gated, as she believed, by the celebrated mr. Pope, with whom she had some literary disputes. Under these impressions our no∣ble poetess, from the consciousness of injured innocence, pours out her spirited invecttives against him in verses addressed to the imitator of the first satire of the second book of Horace. [See Page 19.] How far the acrimony of her pen may be excused or even justified, we submit to the judgment of the candid reader, for whose information we have taken the liberty of subjoining an account of the rise and progress of that rancour which subsisted between these celebrated rivals, in the words of mr. Ayres, the professed panegyrist of mr. Pope, the memoirs of whose life and writings he published at London, in 1745—"A certain lady of quality (says he, vol. 2d, page 194 and 199) took offence—Now from one step of dislike and disgust to another, there was a total misunderstanding be∣tween mr. Pope and her; and as she took all occasions to in∣sinuate things to the world disadvantageous to mr. Pope; that he did not understand <HI>Greek,</HI> but was forc'd to hire persons to translate Homer, &amp;c.—so he, on the other hand (as 'twas re∣ported to her) gave himself great liberties about her; and great mockery was made, and much loud laughter, at the sto∣ry of a visit it was pretended the said lady was permitted to make to the seraglio, when her husband was ambassador at the Porte. It is certain, let the tale arise from whence it will, it was very scandalous, neither can we think (if true) that it
<PB N="4" REF="011340_0003_0F86A0C6077DA210"/>
could possibly have ever come to their knowledge; for it is to be thought that the lady, for the sake of her own fame, would never have divulged so strange a secret.—</P>
<P>"However, as most stories of the like nature do, it gained credit, and most prodigiously exasperated the lady, who ne∣glected no opportunity of raising whoever she could against Mr. Pope and his writings, imagining him the great disperser of this tale; and perhaps he was not entirely clear."—From the foregoing quotation, even in the opinion of mr. Ayres, mr. Pope's guilt may readily be inferred.—But if any reader yet hesitates to pronounce our literary heroine en∣tirely innocent, mr. Ayres is at no loss to do it for him, when he adds "we think the lady's anger just."—Yea the cele∣brated <HI>swan of Thames</HI> himself, according to his above men∣tioned panegyrist, is said to have regretted the part he acted towards this lady: his words are "mr. Pope, towards the latter end of his time, said that, setting apart raillery and the love of satire, he wished he had never offended this lady."—Henceforward defamation will blush at the recital of so ridicu∣lous a story, which never existed, but in the creative fancy of this fair lady's ungenerous satyrist.</P>
<LG>
<L>To a laugh never martyr an innocent name,</L>
<L>'Tis malice most cruelly cool;</L>
<L>Nor plunge the chaste lady in anguish and shame,</L>
<L>For the loudest applause of a fool.</L>

<HEAD>Letter from Lady Mary W. Montague, to Miss—.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Girl,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have so violent a cold, that I never was less qualified in my life for inspecting the heavenly bodies, and must content myself with the vulgar warmth of my dressing room fire, to a corner of which I shall be confined all this evening, and very glad to see you if you can attend me any time after your more learned employment.</P>
<P>If the moon is inhabited by mortals like us, and the most important transactions among them are nothing more than kingdoms turned into common-wealths, and common-wealths into kingdoms, and these mighty events are produced there, as they are here, by tyranny or lust, I have no desire of being acquainted with its inhabitants, but can look down upon them as they do upon us. I have peeped behind the scenes here more than contributes to my ease, and by examining the wires and mechanism of the shew, the entertainment has long since ceased. Who is any longer entertained with the hocus pocus man, when he knows how the tricks are performed? In short, my dear Girl, our most pleasing pursuits become carrion by the time they are hunted down. I would not put you out of con∣ceit with a world you are but just beginning to enter into; but to prepare you to bear those disappointments common to all, but most severely felt by those of your cast and mine, for I would willingly tack myself to any thing that is half so good as I know you to be, and wish myself.</P>

<HEAD>MONDAY.—ROXANA, or the Drawing Room.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>ROXANA from the Court retiring late,</L>
<L>Sigh'd her soft Sorrows at St. James's gate.</L>
<L>Such heavy thoughts lay brooding in her breast,</L>
<L>Not her own chairmen with more weight oppress'd;</L>
<L>They groan the cruel load they're doom'd to bear;</L>
<L>She in these gentle sounds express'd her care.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Was it for this that I these roses wear,</L>
<L>For this new set, the jewels for my hair?</L>
<L>Ah! princess! with what zeal have I pursu'd!</L>
<L>Almost forgot the duty of a prude.</L>
<L>Thinking I never could attend too soon,</L>
<L>I've miss'd my prayers, to get me dress'd by noon.</L>
<L>For thee, ah! what for thee did I resign?</L>
<L>My pleasures, passions, all that e'er was mine.</L>
<L>I sacrific'd both modesty and ease,</L>
<L>Left operas and went to filthy plays;</L>
<L>Double entendres shock'd my tender ear,</L>
<L>Yet even this for thee I chose to bear.</L>
<L>In glowing youth, when nature bids be gay,</L>
<L>And every joy of life before me lay,</L>
<L>By honour prompted, and by pride restrain'd,</L>
<L>The pleasures of the young my soul disdain'd:</L>
<L>Sermons I sought, and with a mien severe</L>
<L>Censur'd my neighbours, and said daily pray'r.</L>
<L>Alas! how chang'd!—with the same sermon-mien.</L>
<L>That once I pray'd, the <HI>What-d'ye-call't</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Farce, by Mr. Gay.</NOTE> I've seen.</L>

I, who avoided every public place,</L>
<L>When bloom and beauty bade me show my face;</L>
<L>Now near thee constant every night abide</L>
<L>With never-failing duty by thy side,</L>
<L>Myself and daughters standing on a row,</L>
<L>To all the foreigners a goodly show!</L>
<L>Oft had your drawing room been sadly thin,</L>
<L>And merchants' wives close by the chair been seen;</L>
<L>Had not I amply fill'd the empty space,</L>
<L>And sav'd your highness from the dire disgrace."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Yet <HI>Coquetilla'</HI>s artifice prevails,</L>
<L>When all my merit and my duty fails,</L>
<L>That <HI>Coquetilla,</HI> whose deluding airs</L>
<L>Corrupts our virgins, and our youth ensnares;</L>
<L>So sunk her character, so lost her fame,</L>
<L>Scarce visited before your highness came,</L>
<L>Yet for the bed-chamber 'tis her you chuse,</L>
<L>When Zeal and Fame and Virtue you refuse.</L>
<L>Ah! worthy choice! not one of all your train</L>
<L>Whom censure blasts not, and dishonours stain.</L>
<L>Let the nice hind now suckle dirty pigs,</L>
<L>And the proud pea-hen hatch the cuckoo's eggs!</L>
<L>Let Iris leave her paint and own her age,</L>
<L>And grave <HI>Suffolka</HI> wed a giddy page!</L>
<L>A greater miracle is daily view'd,</L>
<L>A virtuous princess with a court so lewd."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"I know thee, Court! with all thy treach'rous wiles,</L>
<L>Thy false caresses and undoing smiles!</L>
<L>Ah! princess learn'd in all the courtly arts</L>
<L>To cheat our hopes, and yet to gain our hearts!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Large lovely bribes are the great statesman's aim;</L>
<L>And the neglected patriot follows fame.</L>
<L>The prince is ogled; some the king pursue;</L>
<L>But your <HI>Roxana</HI> only follows <HI>You.</HI></L>
<L>Despis'd <HI>Roxana,</HI> cease, and try to find</L>
<L>Some other, since the princess proves unkind:</L>
<L>Perhaps it is not hard to find at court,</L>

<L>You would not only conquer, but undo:</L>
<L>You, cruel victor, weary of your flame,</L>
<L>Would seek a cure in my eternal shame;</L>
<L>And not content my honour to subdue,</L>
<L>Now strive to triumph o'er my virtue too.</L>
<L>Oh! <HI>Love,</HI> a God indeed to womankind,</L>

<L>Have you forgot with what ensnaring art</L>
<L>You first seduc'd this fond uncautious heart?</L>
<L>Then as I fled did you not kneeling cry,</L>
<L>"Turn, cruel beauty; whither would you fly?</L>
<L>Why all these doubts? why this distrustful fear?</L>
<L>No impious wishes shall offend your ear:</L>
<L>Nor ever shall my boldest hopes pretend</L>
<L>Above the title of a tender friend;</L>
<L>Blest, if my lovely goddess will permit</L>

<L>This fatal proof of love I would not give,</L>
<L>Which you'd contemn the moment you receive.</L>
<L>The wretched she, who yields to guilty joys,</L>
<L>A man may pity, but he must despise.</L>
<L>Your ardour ceas'd, I then should see you shun</L>
<L>The wretched victim by your arts undone.</L>
<L>Yet if I could that cold indifference bear,</L>
<L>What more would strike me with the last despair,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="011340_0006_0F86A0D023D51498"/>

<L>Has love no pleasures free from guilt or fear?</L>
<L>Pleasures less fierce, more lasting, more sincere?</L>
<L>Thus let us gently kiss and fondly gaze,</L>
<L>Love is a child, and like a child it plays.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O trephon, if you would continue just,</L>
<L>If love be something more than brutal lust,</L>
<L>Forbear to ask what I must still deny.</L>
<L>This bitter pleasure, this destructive joy,</L>

<L>The dangerous moments no adieus afford;</L>
<L>—Begone, she cries, I'm sure I hear my lord.</L>
<L>The lover starts from his unfinish'd loves,</L>

<HEAD>VERSES<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>These severe Verses owe their birth to two lines in the first Satire of the second Book of Horace, imitated by Mr. Pope, which were supposed to point at Lady Mary Wortley Montague, under the name of Sappho. We find by the Letters of Mr. Pope, vol. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and those of Lady Mary Wortley Montague late∣ly published, that a friendly correspondence once subsisted be∣tween these two Wits, which probably did not continue much later than her ladyship's return into England in the year 1718. But the exact time when the quarrel between them commenced, and the circumstances relating to it, are not easy, at this dis∣tance of time, to discover. It is said in Mr. Pope's Life, (Bio∣graphia Britannica, vol. 5, p. 3413) that he was charged with propagating a scandalous report concerning her ladyship, which, it is added, perhaps he was not quite clear of. The note to that life in which this charge on the poet is to be found, has the name of Dr. Warburton annexed to it, and therefore, on his authority, may well be supposed not without foundation. If a conjecture may be allowed, it is not improbable that this was the occasion of their difference. With respect to the lines which produced these verses, Mr. Pope, in his letter to Lord Hervey, vol. 8. p. 196. absolutely disclaims any intention of ap∣plying them to Lady Montague, <Q>In regard (says he) to the right honourable Lady, your Lordships friend, I was far from designing a person of her condition by a name so derogatory to her as that of Sappho, a name prostituted to every infa∣mous creature that ever wrote verse or novels. I protest I never applied that name to her in any verse of mine, public or private, and (I firmly believe) not in any letter or conversa∣tion.</Q> What degree of credit this asseveration deserves, must be left to the reader's determination, only observing, that Mr. Pope, was not very scrupulous in disowning a character when the opinion of the Public was not in his favour. With equal, or more earnestness, he denied that the description of Timon's Villa was designed to expose that of a certain nobleman. In which particular, he has been unwarily given up by his Com∣mentator, who, in the following note on these lines in the edition of 1751, seems to acknowledge the fact.</P>
<Q><L>Another age shall see the golden car</L>
<L>Imbrown the slope, and nod on the parterre;</L>
<L>Deep harvests bury all his pride had plann'd,</L>
<L>And laughing Ceres re-assume the land.</L>
<BIBL>MORAL EPISTLES iv. Verse 172.</BIBL></Q>
<P><Q>Had the poet lived but three years longer, he had seen this prophecy fulfilled.</Q> It is to be remembered, that Ca∣nons was sold about the time here fixed upon, and therefore this question will naturally arise, What prophecy was fulfilled, if Mr Pope had not that place in his mind while he was writ∣ing the before-mentioned Epistle? The Editor of his works, as if conscious that he had done no service to Mr. Pope's moral character, by the above note, has since altered it in the follow∣ing manner: <Q>Had the poet lived three years longer, he had seen his <HI>general</HI> prophecy <HI>against all ill-judged magnifi∣cence fulfilled in a very particular instance.</HI></Q></P></NOTE> addressed to the IMITATOR OF THE FIRST SATIRE of the Second Book of HORACE.</HEAD>

Whilst on one side we see how Horace thought;</L>
<L>And on the other how he never wrote:</L>
<L>Who can believe, who view the bad and good,</L>
<L>That the dull copi'st better understood</L>
<L>That Spirit, he pretends to imitate,</L>
<L>Than heretofore that Greek he did translate?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thine is just such an image of <HI>his</HI> pen,</L>
<L>As thou thyself art of the sons of men:</L>
<L>Where our own species in burlesque we trace,</L>
<L>A sign post likeness of the human race;</L>
<L>That is at once resemblance and disgrace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Horace can laugh, is delicate, is clear;</L>
<L>You only coarsely rail, or darkly sneer:</L>
<L>His style is elegant, his diction pure,</L>
<L>Whilst none thy crabbed numbers can endure;</L>
<L>Hard as thy heart, and as thy birth obscure.</L>
<L>If <HI>he</HI> has thorns, they all on roses grow;</L>
<L>Thine like rude thistles, and mean brambles show,</L>
<L>With this exception, that tho' rank the soil,</L>
<L>Weeds as they are they seem produc'd by toil.</L>
<L>Satire should, like a polish'd razor keen,</L>
<L>Wound with a touch, that's scarcely felt or seen.</L>
<L>Thine is an oyster-knife, that hacks and hews;</L>
<L>The rage, but not the talent to abuse;</L>
<L>And is in <HI>hate,</HI> what <HI>love</HI> is in the stews.</L>
<L>'Tis the gross <HI>lust</HI> of hate, that still annoys;</L>
<L>Without distinction, as gross love enjoys:</L>
<L>Neither to folly, nor to vice confin'd;</L>
<L>The object of thy spleen is human kind:</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="011340_0011_0F86A0D39EC24868"/>
It preys on all, who yield or who resist;</L>
<L>To thee 'tis provocation to exist.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But if thou seest<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See TASTE, an Epistle.</NOTE> a great and generous heart,</L>
<L>Thy bow is doubly bent to force a dart.</L>
<L>Nor dignity nor inocence is spar'd,</L>
<L>Nor age, nor sex, nor thrones, nor graves rever'd.</L>
<L>Nor only justice vainly we demand,</L>
<L>But even benefits can't rein thy hand:</L>
<L>To this or that alike in vain we trust,</L>
<L>Nor find thee less ungrateful than unjust.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not even youth and beauty can controul</L>
<L>The universal rancour of thy soul;</L>
<L>Charms that might soften superstition's rage,</L>
<L>Might humble pride, or thaw the ice of age.</L>
<L>But how should'st thou by beauty's force be mov'd,</L>
<L>No more for loving made, than to be lov'd?</L>
<L>It was the equity of righteous heav'n,</L>
<L>That such a soul to such a form was giv'n;</L>
<L>And shews the uniformity of fate,</L>
<L>That one so odious should be born to hate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When God created thee, one would believe,</L>
<L>He said the same as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the snake of <HI>Eve;</HI></L>
<L>To human race antipathy declare,</L>
<L>'Twixt them and thee be everlasting war.</L>
<L>But oh! the sequel of the sentence dread,</L>
<L>And whilst you <HI>bruise their heel,</HI> beware your head.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor think thy weakness shall be thy defence;</L>
<L>The female scold's protection in offence.</L>
<L>Sure 'tis as fair to beat who cannot fight,</L>
<L>As 'tis to libel those who cannot write.</L>
<L>And if thou draw'st thy pen to aid the law,</L>
<L>Others a cudgel, or a rod, may draw.</L>
<L>If none with vengeance yet thy crimes pursue,</L>
<L>Or give thy manifold affronts their due;</L>
<L>If limbs unbroken, skin without a stain,</L>
<L>Unwhipt, unblanketed, unkick'd, unslain;</L>
<L>That wretched little carcase you retain:</L>
<L>The reason is, not that the world wants eyes;</L>
<L>But thou'rt so mean, they see, and they despise:</L>
<L>When fretful <HI>porcupine,</HI> with rancorous will,</L>
<L>From mounted back shoots forth a harmless quill,</L>
<L>Cool the spectators stand; and all the while,</L>
<L>Upon the angry little monster smile.</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="011340_0012_0F86A0D4356403B8"/>
Thus 'tis with thee:—while impotently safe,</L>
<L>You strike unwounding, we unhurt can laugh</L>
<L><HI>Who but must laugh, this bully when he sees,</HI></L>
<L><HI>A puny insect shiv'ring at a breeze?</HI></L>
<L>One over-match'd by ev'ry blast of wind,</L>
<L>Insulting and provoking all mankind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Is this the <HI>thing</HI> to keep mankind in awe,</L>
<L><HI>To make those tremble who escape the law?</HI></L>
<L>Is this <HI>the ridicule</HI> to live so long,</L>
<L><HI>The deathless satire,</HI> and <HI>immortal Song?</HI></L>
<L>No: like thy self-blown praise, thy scandal flies;</L>
<L>And, as we're told of wasps, it stings and dies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If none do yet return th' intended blow,</L>
<L>You all your safety to your dullness owe:</L>
<L>But whilst that armour thy poor corps defends,</L>
<L>'Twill make thy readers few, as are thy friends;</L>
<L>Those, who thy nature loath'd, yet lov'd thy art,</L>
<L>Who lik'd thy head, and yet abhor'd thy heart;</L>
<L>Chose thee, to read, but never to converse,</L>
<L>And scorn'd in prose, him whom they priz'd in verse.</L>
<L>Even they shall now their partial error see,</L>
<L>Shall shun thy writings like thy company;</L>
<L>And to thy books shall ope their eyes no more,</L>
<L>Than to thy person they wou'd do their door.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor thou the justice of the world disown,</L>
<L>That leaves thee thus an out-cast, and alone;</L>
<L>For tho' in law, to murder be to kill,</L>
<L>In equity the murder's in the will:</L>
<L>Then whilst with coward hand you stab a name,</L>
<L>And try at least t'assassinate our fame;</L>
<L>Like the first bold assassins be thy lot,</L>
<L>Ne'er be thy guilt forgiven, or forgot;</L>
<L>But as thou hat'st, be hated by mankind,</L>
<L>And with the emblem of thy crooked mind,</L>
<L>Mark'd on thy back, like Cain, by God's own hand,</L>
<L>Wander, like him, accursed through the land.</L>

<LG>
<L>HOW happy you! who varied joys pursue;</L>
<L>And every hour presents you something new!</L>
<L>Plans, schemes, and models, all Palladio's art,</L>
<L>For six long months have gain'd upon your heart;</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="011340_0012_0F86A0D4356403B8"/>
Of colonades, of corridores you talk,</L>
<L>The winding stair-case and the cover'd walk;</L>
<L>You blend the orders with Vitruvian toil,</L>
<L>And raise with wond'rous joy the fancy'd pile:</L>
<L>But the dull workman's slow performing hand</L>
<L>But coldly executes his lord's command.</L>
<L>With dirt and mortar soon you grow displeas'd,</L>
<L>Planting succeeds, and avenues are rais'd,</L>
<L>Canals are cut, and mountains level made;</L>
<L>Bowers of retreat, and galleries of shade;</L>
<L>The shaven turf presents a lively green;</L>
<L>The bordering flowers in mystic knots are seen:</L>
<L>With studied art on nature you refine—</L>
<L>The spring beheld you warm in this design,</L>
<L>But scarce the cold attacks your fav'rite trees,</L>
<L>Your inclination fails, and wishes freeze:</L>
<L>You quit the grove, so—lately you admir'd;</L>
<L>With other views your eager hopes are fir'd,</L>
<L>Post to the city you direct your way;</L>
<L>Not blooming paradise could bribe your stay:</L>
<L>Ambition shews you power's brightest side,</L>
<L>'Tis meanly poor in solitude to hide:</L>
<L>Though certain pains attend the cares of state,</L>
<L>A good man owes his country to be great;</L>
<L>Shou'd act abroad the high-distinguish'd part,</L>
<L>Or shew at least the purpose of his heart.</L>
<L>With thoughts like these the shining courts you seek;</L>
<L>Full of new projects for almost a week:</L>
<L>You then despise the tinsel glittering snare;</L>
<L>Think vile mankind below a serious care.</L>
<L>Life is too short for any distant aim;</L>
<L>And cold the dull reward of future fame:</L>
<L>Be happy then, while yet you have to live;</L>
<L>And love is all the blessing heav'n can give.</L>
<L>Fir'd by new passion you address the fair;</L>
<L>Survey the opera as a gay parterre:</L>
<L>Young Cloe's bloom had made you certain prize,</L>
<L>But for a side-long glance from Celia's eyes:</L>
<L>Your beating heart acknowledges her power;</L>
<L>Your eager eyes her lovely form devour;</L>
<L>You feel the poison swelling in your breast,</L>
<L>And all your soul by fond desire possess'd.</L>
<L>In dying sighs a long three hours are past;</L>
<L>To some assembly with impatient haste,</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="011340_0013_0F86A0D72C300AD0"/>
With trembling hope, and doubtful fear you move,</L>
<L>Resolv'd to tempt your fate, and own your love:</L>
<L>But there Belinda meets you on the stairs,</L>
<L>Easy her shape, attracting all her airs;</L>
<L>A smile she gives, and with a smile can wound:</L>
<L>Her melting voice has music in the sound;</L>
<L>Her every motion wears resistless grace;</L>
<L>Wit in her mein, and pleasure in her face:</L>
<L>Here while you vow eternity of love,</L>
<L>Cloe and Celia unregarded move.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus on the sands of Afric's burning plains,</L>
<L>However deeply made, no long impress remains;</L>
<L>The slightest leaf can leave its figure there;</L>
<L>The strongest form is scattered by the air.</L>
<L>So yielding the warm temper of your mind,</L>
<L>So touch'd by every eye, so toss'd by wind;</L>
<L>Oh! how unlike the heav'n my soul design'd!</L>
<L>Unseen, unheard, the throng around me move;</L>
<L>Not wishing praise, insensible of love:</L>
<L>No whispers soften, nor no beauties fire;</L>
<L>Careless I see the dance, and coldly hear the lyre.</L>
<L>So num'rous herds are driv'n o'er the rock;</L>
<L>No print is left of all the passing flock:</L>
<L>So sings the wind around the solid stone:</L>
<L>So vainly beat the waves with fruitless moan:</L>
<L>Tedious the toil, and great the workman's care,</L>
<L>Who dare attempt to fix impressions there:</L>
<L>But should some swain more skilful than the rest,</L>
<L>Engrave his name upon this marble breast,</L>
<L>Not rolling ages could deface that name;</L>
<L>Thro' all the storms of life 'tis still the same:</L>
<L>Tho' length of years with moss may shade the ground,</L>
<L>Deep, though unseen, remains the secret wound.</L>

<HEAD>EPISTLE from Arthur Grey, the Footman,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This man was footman to a gentleman whose daughter, a married lady, he attempted to ravish. It appears by his trial, that he went into her room about four o'clock in the morning, armed with a pistol in one hand, and a drawn sword in the o∣ther; and advancing to the bed side, threatned to murder her if she made any noise. Upon asking him what he meant by com∣ing into her chamber in such a manner, he replied, that he in∣tended to ravish her, for that he had entertained a violent love for her a long time, but as there was so great a difference be∣tween their fortunes, he despaired of enjoying his wishes by any means but force. After some resistance, the lady wrench∣ed the pistol from his hand (he having laid down the sword) and rung the bell; upon which he ran away. He was indicted and convicted of a burglary, at the Old Bailey, in December 1721, but the sentence was not executed, for he was reprieved, and afterwards transported.</NOTE> After his Condemnation for attempting a RAPE.</HEAD>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Long had I liv'd as sordid as my fate,</L>
<L>Nor curs'd the destiny that made me wait</L>
<L>A▪ servile slave: content with homely food,</L>
<L>The gross instinct of happiness pursu'd:</L>
<L>Youth gave me sleep at night, and warmth of blood.</L>
<L>Ambition yet had never touch'd my breast;</L>
<L>My lordly master knew no sounder rest;</L>
<L>With labour healthy, in obedience blest.</L>
<L>But when I saw—oh! had I never seen</L>
<L>That wounding softness that engaging mein!</L>
<L>The mist of wretched education flies,</L>
<L>Shame, fear, desire, despair and love arise,</L>
<L>The new creation of those beauteous eyes.</L>
<L>But yet that love pursu'd no guilty aim,</L>
<L>Deep in my heart I hid the secret flame.</L>
<L>I never hop'd my fond desire to tell,</L>
<L>And all my wishes were to serve you well.</L>
<L>Heav'ns! how I flew, when wing'd by your command,</L>
<L>And kiss'd the letters given me by your hand.</L>
<L>How pleas'd, how proud, how fond was I to wait,</L>
<L>Present the sparkling wine, or change the plate!</L>
<L>How when you sung my soul devour'd the sound,</L>
<L>And ev'ry sense was in the rapture drown'd!</L>
<L>Tho' bid to go I quite forgot to move;</L>
<L>—You knew not that stupidity was love!</L>
<L>But oh! the torment not to be express'd,</L>
<L>The grief, the rage, the hell that fir'd this breast,</L>

<L>And jealous fury all my soul possess'd</L>
<L>Like torrents, love and indignation meet,</L>
<L>And madness would have thrown me at your feet.</L>
<L>Turn, lovely nymph (for so I would have said)</L>
<L>Turn from those triflers who make love a trade;</L>
<L>This is true passion in my eyes you see;</L>
<L>They cannot, no—they cannot love like me.</L>
<L>Frequent debauch has pall'd their sickly taste,</L>
<L>Faint their desire, and in a moment past,</L>
<L>They sigh not from the heart, but from the brain;</L>
<L>Vapours of vanity, and strong champagne.</L>
<L>Too dull to feel what forms, like yours, inspire,</L>
<L>After long talking of their painted fire,</L>
<L>To some lewd brothel they at night retire;</L>

<L>I saw the dear disorder of your bed;</L>

Your night gown fasten'd with a single pin;</L>

<L>I fix'd my eyes upon that heaving breast,</L>
<L>And hardly, hardly I forbore the rest;</L>
<L>Eager to gaze, unsatisfy'd with sight,</L>
<L>My head grew giddy with the dear delight!</L>
<L>—Too well you know the fatal following night!</L>
<L>Th' extremest proof of my desire I give,</L>
<L>And since you will not love, I will not live.</L>
<L>Condemn'd by you, I wait the righteous doom,</L>
<L>Careless and fearless of the woes to come.</L>
<L>But when you see me waver in the wind,</L>
<L>My guilty flame extinct, my soul resign'd,</L>
<L>Sure you may pity what you can't approve,</L>
<L>The cruel consequence of furious love.</L>
<L>Think the bold wretch that could so greatly dare,</L>
<L>Was tender, faithful, ardent, and sincere:</L>
<L>Think when I held the pistol to your breast,</L>
<L>Had I been of the world's large rule possess'd,</L>
<L>That world had then been yours, and I been blest!</L>
<L>Think that my life was quite below my care,</L>

Their every wish was in this Mary seen,</L>
<L>Gay, witty, youthful, beauteous, and a queen.</L>
<L>Vain useless blessings with ill conduct join'd!</L>
<L>Light as the air, and fleeting as the wind.</L>
<L>Whatever poets write, and lovers vow,</L>
<L>Beauty, what poor omnipotence hast thou!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Queen Bess had wisdom, council, power, and laws;</L>
<L>How few espous'd a wretched beauty's cause!</L>
<L>Learn thence, ye fair, more solid charms to prize,</L>
<L>Contemn the idle flatt'rers of your eyes.</L>
<L>The brightest object shines but while 'tis new:</L>
<L>That influence lessens by familiar view.</L>
<L>Monarchs and beauties rule with equal sway,</L>
<L>All strive to serve, and glory to obey;</L>
<L>Alike unpitied when depos'd they grow—</L>
<L>Men mock the idol of their former vow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Two great examples have been shewn to-day,</L>
<L>To what sure ruin passion does betray;</L>
<L>What long repentance to short joys is due;</L>
<L>When reason rules, what glory does ensue.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If you will love, love like Eliza then;</L>
<L>Love for amusement, like those traitors, men.</L>
<L>Think that the pastime of a leisure hour</L>
<L>She favour'd oft—but never shar'd her pow'r.</L>
<L>The traveller by desart wolves pursu'd,</L>
<L>If by his art the savage foe's subdu'd,</L>
<L>The world will still the noble act applaud,</L>
<L>Tho' victory was gain'd by needful fraud.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such is, my tender sex, our helpless care;</L>
<L>And such the barbarous heart, hid by the begging face.</L>
<L>By passion fir'd, and not withheld by shame,</L>
<L>They cruel hunters are; we, trembling game.</L>
<L>Trust me, dear ladies, (for I know 'em well)</L>
<L>They burn to triumph, and they sigh to tell:</L>
<L>Cruel to them that yield, cullies to them that sell.</L>
<L>Believe me, 'tis by far the wiser course,</L>
<L>Superior art should meet superior force:</L>
<L>Hear, but be faithful to your int'rest still:</L>
<L>Secure your hearts—then fool with whom you will.</L>

<L>AT length, by so much importunity press'd,</L>
<L>Take, C—, at once, the inside of my breast.</L>
<L>This stupid indiff'rence so often you blame,</L>
<L>Is not owing to nature, to fear, or to shame.</L>
<L>I am not as cold as a virgin in lead,</L>
<L>Nor is Sunday's sermon so strong in my head:</L>
<L>I know but too well how time flies along,</L>

<L>Would value his pleasure, contribute to mine:</L>
<L>Not meanly would boast, nor lewdly design,</L>

<L>In public preserve the decorum that's just,</L>

<L>From such a dear lover as here I describe,</L>

<P>THE ease and elegance, of the stile of these LETTERS; fully justifies the very favourable reception they have met with, a luxuriant fancy displays itself through the whole in a variety of ENTER∣TAINING DESCRIPTIONS; And the Wit and Spirit which gave LADY MARY WORTLEY MONTAGUE▪ during her Life such rank in the POLITE WORLD, was in no instance more happily displayed than in her CELEBRATED DEFENCE OF MARRIAGE against the Duke De La Roche Fou∣cault's maxim, 'That Marriage is some∣times convenient, but never delightful.' (see Letter LIX. from page 36. to 49) We think all Readers of taste will be of opinion with us, that there is no Letter in the collection where the Life and Spirit of the <HI>ingenious, elegant, noble,</HI> and truly Right honourable Writer is to be more admired or the sentiments more approved.</P>

<P>I FIND after all, by your letter of yesterday, that Mrs. D—is resolved to marry the old greasy Curate. She was always High Church in an excessive degree, and you know she used to speak of Sacheve∣rel as an Apostolick Saint, who was wor∣thy to sit in the same place with St. Paul, if not a step above him. It is a matter however very doubtful to me, whether it is not still more the <HI>man</HI> than the <HI>apostle</HI> that Mrs. D—looks to in the present alliance. Tho' at the age of forty, she is, I assure you, very far from being cold and insensible; her fire may be covered with ashes, but is not extinguished.—Don't be deceived my dear Lady, by that pru∣dish and sanctified air—Warm devoti∣ons are no equivocal marks of warm pas∣sions; besides I know it is a fact, (of which I have proofs in hand, which I will tell you by word of mouth) that our learned and holy prude is exceedingly disposed to use the <HI>means,</HI> supposed in the primi∣tive command, let what will come of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> end▪ the Curate in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eed is very filthy—

Such a red, spungy, watry nose! Such a squint! in short, he is ugly beyond ex∣pression; and what ought naturally to ren∣der him peculiarly dipleasing to one of Mrs. D—'s constitution and propensities, he is stricken in years. Nor do I really know how they will live. He has but forty five pounds a year—she but a trifling sum; so that they are likely to feast upon love and ec∣clesiastical history, which will be very empty food without a proper mixture of beef and pudding. I have, however, en∣gaged our friend, who is the curate's land∣lord, to give them a good lease; and if Mrs. D—, instead of spending whole days in reading Collier, Hicks, and vile translations of Plato and Epictetus, will but form the resolution of taking care of her house and minding her dairy, things may go tolerably. It is not likely that their <HI>tender loves</HI> will give them many <HI>sweet babes</HI> to provide for.</P>
<P>I met the lover yesterday, going to the alehouse in his dirty night-gown, with a book under his arm to entertain the club; and as Mrs. D—was with me at the time, I pointed out to her the charming creature: she blushed and looked prim; but quoted a passage out of Herodotus, in which it is said that the Persians wore long right gowns. There is really no more ac∣counting for the taste in marriage of ma∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y of our sex than there is for the ape∣tite
<PB N="5" REF="011340_0022_0F86A0DF75A44CC0"/>
of your neighbour Miss S—y, who makes such waste of chalk and charcoal when they fall in her way.</P>
<P>As marriage produces children, so chil∣dren produce care, disputes and wrang∣ling, as it is said (at least by old batche∣lors and old maids) is one of the <HI>sweets</HI> of the conjugal state: you tell me that our friend Mrs.—is, at length, blessed with a son; and that her husband who is a great philosopher, [if his own testimony is to be depended upon] insists on her suckling it herself. You ask my advice on this mat∣ter; and to give it you frankly, I really think that Mr—'s demand is unreason, able, as his wife's constitution is tender, and her temper fretful. A true philosopher would consider these circumstances, but a pedant is always throwing his system in your face, and applies it equally to all things, times and places, just like a taylor, who would make a coat out of his own head, without any regard to the bulk or figure of the person that must wear it. All those fine▪ spun arguments that he has drawn from na∣ture to stop your mouths, weigh, I must own to you, but very little with me. This same <HI>Nature</HI> is indeed a specious word, nay there is a great deal in it if it is properly understood and applied, but I cannot bear to hear people using it to justify what com∣mon sense must disavow. Is not nature modified by art in many things? Was it
<PB N="6" REF="011340_0023_0F86A0E0586E1AC8"/>
not designed to be so? And is it not hap∣py for human society, that it is so? Would you like to see your husband let his beard grow until he would be obliged to put the end of it in his pocket, because this beard is the gift of Nature? The instincts of nature point out neither tailors, nor weavers, nor mantua makers, nor semp∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>resses, nor milliners: And yet I am very glad that we do not run naked like the Hottentots. But not to wander from the subject—I grant that Nature has fur∣nished the mother with milk to nourish her child; but I maintain at the same time that if she can find better milk elsewhere, she ought to prefer it without hesitation. I dont see why she should have more scru∣ple to do this, than her husband has to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ve the clear fountain, which Nature gave him to quench his thirst, for stout Octo∣ber, Port, or Claret. Indeed if Mrs.—was a buxom, sturdy woman, who lived on plain food, took regular exercise, en∣joyed proper returns of rest, and was free from violent passions (which you and I know is not the case) she might be a good nurse for her child; but as matters stand, I do verily think that the milk of a good comely cow, who seeds quietly in her meadow, never devours ragouts, nor drinks ratafia: nor frets at quadrille, nor sits up till three in the morning elat∣ed with gain or dejected with loss,
<PB N="7" REF="011340_0023_0F86A0E0586E1AC8"/>
I do think that the milk of such a cow or of a nurse that came as near it as possible, would be likely to nourish the young squire much better than hers. If it be true that the child sucks in the mo∣ther's passions with her milk, this is a strong argument in favour of the cow, unless you may be afraid that the young squire may become a calf; but how many calves are there both in state and church, who have been brought up with their mother's milk?</P>
<P>I promise faithfully to communicate to no mortal the letter you wrote me last—What you say of the two rebel Lords, I believe to be true; but I can do nothing in the matter.—If my projects don't fail in the execution, I shall see you before a month passes. Give my service to Dr. Blackbeard—He is a good man, but I never saw in my life such a persecuting face cover a humane and tender heart. I imagine (within myself) that the Smith∣field priests, who burned the protestants in the time of Queen Mary, had just such faces as the Doctor's. If we were papists I should like him very much for my con∣fessor: his seeming austerity would give you and me a great reputation for sanctity, and his good, indulgent heart, would be the very thing that would suit us in the affair of penance and ghostly direction.</P>

<HEAD>To the Abbot—.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Vienna,</HI> <DATE>January 2, O. S. 1717.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM really almost tired with the life of Vienna. I am not, indeed, an enemy to dissipation and hurry, much less to amuse∣ment and pleasure; but I cannot endure long, even pleasure, when it is fettered, with formality, and assumes the air of sys∣tem. 'Tis true, I have had here some ve∣ry agreeable connexions, and what will per∣haps surprise you. I have particular plea∣sure in my Spanish acquaintances. Count Oropesa and General Puebla these two noblemen are much in the good graces of the Emperor, and yet they seem to be brewing mischief. The court of Madrid cannot reflect without pain upon the terri∣tories that were cut off from the Spanish monarchy by the peace of Utrecht, and it seems to be looking wishfully out for an opportunity of getting them back again. That is a matter about which I trouble myself very little; let the court be in the right or in the wrong, I like mightily the two Counts its ministers. I dined with them both some days ago at Count Wurm∣brand's, an Aulic counsellor and a man of
<PB N="9" REF="011340_0024_0F86A0E3E4D43518"/>
letters, who is universally esteemed here. But the first man in this court, in point of knowledge and abilities, is certainly the Count Schsick, High Chancellor of Bohe∣mia, whose immense reading is accompa∣nied with a fine taste and a solid judgment; he is a declared enemy to Prince Eugene, and a warm firiend to the honest hot head∣ed Marshal Staremberg. One of the most accomplished men I have seen at Vienna is the young Count Tarrocco, who accom∣panies the amiable Prince of Portugal. I am almost in love with them both and won∣der to see such elegant manners, and such free and generous sentiments in two young men who have hitherto seen nothing but their own country. The count is just such a Roman Ca∣tholick as you; he succeeds greatly with the-devout beauties here; his first overtures in gal∣lantry are disguised under the luscious strains of spiritual love, that were sung formerly by the sublimely voluptuous Fenelon and the tender madam Guion, who turned the fire of carnal love to divine objects; thus the Count begins with the <HI>spirit,</HI> and ends ge∣nerally with the <HI>flesh,</HI> when he makes his addresses to holy virgins.</P>
<P>I made acquaintance yesterday with the famous poet Rousseau, who lives here un∣der the peculiar protection of Prince Eu∣gene, by whose liberality he subsists. He passes here for a free thinker, and, what is still worse in my esteem, for a man whose
<PB N="10" REF="011340_0025_0F86A0E516D98C60"/>
heart does not feel the encomiums he gives to virtue and honour in his poems. I like his odes mightily they are much superior to the lyrick productions of our English po∣ets, few of whom have made any figure in that kind of poetry. I don't find that learn∣ed men abound here; there is indeed a prodigious number of Alchymists at Vien∣na; the <HI>philosophers stone</HI> is the great ob∣ject of zeal and science; and those who have more reading and capacity than the vulgar, have transported their superstition (shall I call it?) or fanaticism from religi∣on to chymistry; and they believe in a new kind of transubstantiation, which is designed to make the laity as rich as the other kind has made the priesthood. This pestilential passion has already ruin∣ed several great houses. There is scarcely a man of opulence or fashion, that has not an Alchymist in his service, and even the emperor is supposed to be no enemy to this folly in secret, tho' he has pretended to discourage it in publick.</P>
<P>Prince Eugene was so polite as to shew me his library yesterday; we found him attended by Rousseau, and his favourite Count Bonneval, who is a man of wit, and is here thought to be a very bold enter prizing spirit. The library, tho' not very ample, is well chosen; but as the prince will admit into it no editions but what are beautiful and pleasing to the eye, and there
<PB N="11" REF="011340_0025_0F86A0E516D98C60"/>
are nevertheless numbers of excellent books that are but indifferently printed, this finikin and fopish taste makes many disagreeable chasms in this collection. The books are pompously bound in Turkey leather, and two of the most famous bookbinders of Paris were expressly sent for to do this work Bonneval pleasantly told me that there were several quarto's on the art of war, that were bound with the skins of <HI>Spahis</HI> and <HI>Janissaries;</HI> and this jest, which was indeed elegant, raised a smile of pleasure on the grave countenance of the famous warrior. The Prince, who is a connoiseur in the fine arts, shewed me, with particu∣lar pleasure, the famous collection of portraits that formerly belonged to Fou∣quet, and which he purchased at an exces∣sive price. He has augmented it with a considerable number of new acquisitions, so that he has now in his possession such a collection in that kind as you will scarcely find in any ten cabinets in Europe. If I told you the number, you would say that I made an indiscreet use of the permission to lie, which is more or less given to tra∣vellers by the indulgence of the candid.</P>
<P>Count Tarrocco is just come in—He is the only person I have excepted this morning in my general order to receive no company.—I think I see you smile,—but I am not so far gone as to stand in need of absolution; tho', as the human
<PB N="12" REF="011340_0026_0F86A0E66968D868"/>
heart is deceitful, and the Count very a∣greeable, you may think that even tho' I should not want an absolution, I would nevertheless be glad to have an indul∣gence.—No such thing.—However, as I am a heretick, and you no confes∣sor, I shall make no declarations on this head.—The design of the Count's visit is a ball;—more pleasure—I shall be surfeited.</P>

<P>WHEN I wrote to you last, Belgrade was in the hands of the Turks; but at this present moment, it has changed masters, and is in the hands of the Im∣perialists. A Janissary who in nine days, and yet without any wings but what a pannick terror seems to have furnished, arrived at Constantinople from the army of the Turks before Belgrade, brought Mr. W—the news of a compleat vic∣tory obtained by the imperialists, com∣manded by prince Eugene, over the Ot∣toman troops. It is said the Prince has discovered great conduct and valour in this action, and I am particularly glad
<PB N="13" REF="011340_0026_0F86A0E66968D868"/>
that the voice of glory and duty has call'd him from the—<HI>(here several words of the manuscript are effaced.)</HI>—Two days after the battle the town surrendered. The consternation, which this defeat has occasion∣ed here, is inexpressible; and the Sultan apprehending a revolution from the re∣sentment and indignation of the people, fomented by certain leaders, has begun his goodly precautions after the goodly fashi∣on of his blessed government, by order∣ing several persons to be strangled who were the objects of his royal suspicion. He has also ordered his treasurer to ad∣vance some months pay to the Janissaries, which seems the less necessary, as their con∣duct has been bad in this campaign, and their licentious ferocity seems pretty well tamed by the publick contempt, such of them as return in straggling and fugitive parties to the metropolis, have not spirit nor credit enough to defend themselves from the insults of the mob; the very chil∣dren taunt them and the populace spit in their faces as they pass. They refused during the battle to lend their assistance to save the baggage and the military chest, which however were defended by the Ba∣shaws and their retinue while the Janis∣saries and spahis were nobly employed in plundering their own camp.</P>
<P>You see here that I give you a very <HI>handsome</HI> return for your obliging letter.
<PB N="14" REF="011340_0027_0F86A0E7088A2070"/>
You entertain me with a most agreeable ac∣count of your amiable connexions with men of letters and taste, and of the deliscious mo∣ments you pass in their society under the rural shade; and I exhibit to you in return the barbarous spectacles of Turks and Ger∣mans cutting one another's throats. But what can you expect from such a country as this from which the muses have fled, from which letters seem eternally banish∣ed, and in which you see, in private scenes, nothing pursued as happiness but the refinements of an indolent voluptuousness, and where those who act upon the pub∣lick theatre live in uncertainty, suspicion, and terror. Pleasure to which I am no e∣nemy, when it is duly seasoned and o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a good composition, is surely here of the cloying kind. Veins of wit, elegant con∣versation easy commerce, are unknown among the Turks; and yet they seem ca∣pable of all these, if the vile spirit of their government did not stifle genius, damp curiosity, and suppress an hundred passions, that embellish and render life agreeable. The luscious passion of the Seraglio is the only one almost that is gratified here to the full, but it is blended so with the surly spirit of despotism in one of the parties, and with the dejection and anxiety which this spirit produces in the other, that to one of my way of thinking it cannot appear otherwise than as a very mixed kind of
<PB N="15" REF="011340_0027_0F86A0E7088A2070"/>
enjoyment. The women here are not in∣deed, so closely confined as many have related; they enjoy a high degree of li∣berty even in the bosom of servitude, and they have methods of evasion and disguise that are very favourable to gallanty; but after all, they are still under uneasy ap∣prehensions of being discovered; and a dis∣covery exposes them to the most mer∣ciless rage of jealousy, which is here a monster that cannot be satiated but with blood. The magnificence and riches that reign in the apartments of the ladies of fashion here, seem to be one of their chief pleasures, joined with their retinue of fe∣male slaves, whose musick dancing and dress amuse them highly; but there is such an air of form and stiffness amidst this grandeur, as hinders it from pleasing me at long run, however I was dazzled with it at first sight. This stiffness and formality of manners are peculiar to the Turkish ladies; for the Grecian belles are of quite another character and complex∣ion; with them pleasure appears in more engaging forms, and their persons, man∣ners, conversation, and amusements are ve∣ry far from being destitute of elegance and ease,—</P>
<P>I received the news of Mr. Addison's being declared Secretary of State with the less surprise, in that I know that post was almost offered to him before. At that time
<PB N="16" REF="011340_0028_0F86A0E7D9644268"/>
he declined it, and I really believe that he would have done well to have declin∣ed it now. Such a post as that, and such a wife as the Countess, do not seem to be, in prudence eligible, for a man that is asthmatick; and we may see the day when he will be heartily glad to resign them both. It is well that he laid aside the thoughts of the voluminous dictionary of which I have heard you or somebody else frequently make mention. But no more on that subject; I would not have said so much, were I not assured that this letter will come safe and unopened to hand. I long much to tread upon English ground, that I may see you and Mr. Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣greve, who render that ground <HI>classick;</HI> nor will you refuse our present Secretary a part of that merit, whatever reasons you may may have to be dissatisfied with him in other respects. Ye are the three hap∣piest poets I ever heard of; one a secre∣tary of state the other enjoying leisure with dignity in two lucrative employ∣ments; and you, tho' your religious pro∣fession is an obstacle to court promotion, and disqualifies you from filling civil em∣ployments, have found the <HI>Philosophers stone</HI> since by making the Iliad pass through your poetical crucible into an English form without losing aught of its original beau∣ty, you have drawn the golden current of Pactolus to Twickenham. I call this find∣ing
<PB N="17" REF="011340_0028_0F86A0E7D9644268"/>
the Philosophers stone, since you alone found out the secret, and nobody else has got into it. Addison and Tickell tried it, but their experiments failed; and they lost if not their money, at least a certain por∣tion of their fame in the trial—while you touched the mantle of the divine Bard, and imbibed his spirit. I hope we shall have the Odyssey soon from your happy hand, and I think I shall follow with sin∣gular pleasure the traveller Ulysses, who was an observer of Men and manners, when he travels in your harmonious numbers, I love him much better than the hot head∣ed son of Peleus, who bullied his general, cried for his mistress, and so on. It is true, the excellence o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Iliad does not depend, upon his merit or dignity, but I wish ne∣vertheless that Homer had chosen a hero somewhat less pettish and less fantastick: a perfect hero is chimerical and unnatural, and consequently uninstructive; but it is also true that while the epick hero ought to be drawn with the infirmities that are the lot of humanity, he ought never to be represented as extremely absurd. But it becomes me ill to play the critick; so I take my leave of you for this time, and desire you will believe me with the high∣est esteem,</P>

<P>I SET out from Bologna the moment I had finished the letter I wrote you on Mon∣day last, and shall now continue to inform you of the things that have struck me most in this excursion. Sad roads—hilly and rocky—between Bologna and Fierenzuola. Between this latter place and Florence I went out of my road to visit the monastery of <HI>La Trappe,</HI> which is of French origin and one of the most austere and self-denying orders I have met with. In this gloomy retreat it gave me pain to observe the infatuation of men, who have devoutly reduced themselves to a much worse condi∣tion than that of the beasts▪ Folly, you see, is the lot of humanity, whether it arises in the flowry paths of pleasure or the thorny ones of an ill-judged devotion. But of the two sorts of fools, I shall always think that the merry one has the most eligible
<PB N="19" REF="011340_0029_0F86A0E8747C8218"/>
fate; and I cannot well form a notion of that spiritual and extatick joy that is mixed with sighs, groans, hunger and the other complicated miseries of mo∣nastick discipline. It is a strange way of go∣ing to work for happiness to excite an enmity between soul and body, which nature and providence have designed to live together in union and friendship, and which we cannot separate like man and wife when they happen to disagree. The pro∣found silence that is enjoined upon the monks of <HI>La Trappe,</HI> is a singular cir∣cumstance of their unsociable and unnatu∣ral discipline; and were this injunction ne∣ver to be dispensed with, it would be needless to visit them in any other cha∣racter than as a collection of statues; but the superior of the convent suspended, in our favour, that rigorous law, and allow∣ed 'one of the mutes to converse with me, and answer a few discreet questions. He told me that the monks of this or∣der in France are still more austere than those of Italy, as they never taste wine, flesh, fish or eggs; but live entirely up∣on vegetables. The story that is related of the institution of this order is remark∣able, and is well attested if my informa∣tion be good. Its founder was a French nobleman whose name was <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>thillier de Rancé</HI> a man of pleasure and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>

gloom of devotion By the following in∣cident. His affairs obliged him to absent himself, for some time, from a lady with whom he had lived in the most intimate and tender connexions of successful love. At his return to Paris he proposed to surprise her agreeably, and at the same time, to satisfy his own impatient desire of seeing her, by going directly and with∣out ceremony to her apartment by a back stair, which he was well acquainted with—but think of the spectacle that pre∣sented itself to him at his entrance into the chamber that had so often been the scene of loves highest raptures! his mistress dead—dead of the small pox—disfigured beyond expression—a loathsome mass of putrified matter—and the surgeon sepa∣rating the head from the body, because the coffin had been made too short! He stood for a moment motionless in amaze∣ment, and filled with horror—and then retired from the world, shut himself up in the convent of <HI>La Trappe,</HI> where he passed the remainder of his days in the most cruel and disconsolate devotion.—Let us quit this sad subject.</P>
<P>I must not forget to tell you that be∣fore I came to this monastery I went to see the burning mountains near Fie∣renzuola, of which the naturalists speak as a great curiosity. The flame it sends
<PB N="21" REF="011340_0030_0F86A095F6131FD8"/>
forth is without smoke, and resembles brandy set on fire. The ground about it is well cultivated, and the fire appears on∣ly in one spot where there is a cavity, whose circumference is but small, but in it are several crevices whose depths are unknown. It is remarkable that when a piece of wood is thrown into this cavi∣ty, tho it cannot pass thro' the crevices, yet it is consumed in a moment, and that though the ground about it be perfectly cold, yet if a stick be rubbed with any force against it, it emits a flame, which how∣ever, is neither hot nor durable like that of the volcano. If you desire a more cir∣cumstantial account of this phenomenon, and have made a sufficient progress in Ita∣lian to read father Carazzi's description of it, you need not be at a loss, for I have sent this description to Mr. F—, and you have only to ask it of him. After observing the volcano, I scrambled up all the neighbouring hills, partly on horse∣back, partly on foot, but could find no vestige of fire in any of them; though common report would make one believe that they all contain volcano's,</P>
<P>I hope you have not taken it in your head to expect from me a description of the famous gallery here, where I arrived on Thursday at noon; this would be requir∣ing a volume instead of a letter; besides I have as yet seen but a part of this im∣mense
<PB N="22" REF="011340_0031_0F86A07A3658E338"/>
treasure, and I propose employing some weeks more to survey the whole. You cannot imagine any situation more agreeable than Florence. It lies in a fertile and smiling valley watered by the Arno which runs thro' the city, and nothing can surpass the beauty and magnificence of its publick buildings, particularly the ca∣thedral, whose grandeur filled me with a∣stonishment. The palaces, squares, foun∣tains, statues, bridges, do not only carry an aspect full of elegance and greatness, but discover a taste quite different, in kind, from that which reigns in the publick edifices in other countries. The more I see of Italy, the more I am persuaded that the Italians have a stile (if I may use that expression) in every thing, which distinguishes them almost essentially from all other Europeans. Where they have got it,—whether from natural genius or ancient imitation and inheritance, I shall not examine; but the fact is cer∣tain. I have been but one day in the gallery, that amazing repository of the most precious remains of antiquity, and which alone is sufficient to immortalize the illustrious house of Medicis, by whom it was built and enriched as we now see it. I was so impatient to see the fa∣mous Venus of Medicis, that I went hastily thro' six apartments in order to get a sight of this divine figure, purposing
<PB N="23" REF="011340_0031_0F86A07A3658E338"/>
when I had satisfied this ardent curiosity, to return and view the rest at my leisure. As I indeed passed thro' the great room which contains the ancient statues, I was stopped short at viewing the Antinous, which they had placed near that of Adrian, to revive the remembrance of their pre∣posterous loves, which I suppose the Flo∣rentines rather look upon as an object of envy, than of horror and disgust. This sta∣tue, like that of the Venus de Medicis, spurns description: such figures my eyes never beheld—I can now understand that Ovid's comparing a fine woman a fine woman to a statue, which I formerly thought a very disobliging similitude, was the nicest and highest piece of flattery. The Antinous is entirely naked, alll its parts are bigger than nature; but the whole, taken together, and the fine attitude of the figure carry such an expression of ease, elegance and grace, as no words can describe. When I saw the Venus I was wrapt in wonder,—and I could not help casting a thought back upon Antinous. They ought to be placed together. They are worthy of each other—If marble could see and feel, the separation might be prudent,—if it could only <HI>see,</HI> it would certainly lose its coldness and learn to feel, and in such a case the charms of these two figures would produce an effect quite opposite to that of the Gor∣gon's
<PB N="24" REF="011340_0032_0F86A07CEDE8A7B0"/>
head, which turned flesh into stone. Did I pretend to describe to you the Ve∣nus, it would only set your imagination at work to form ideas of her figure, and your idea's would no more resemble that figure, than the Portuguese face of Miss N—who has enchanted our knight, resembles the sweet and graceful countenance of la∣dy—his former flame. The description of a face or figure is a needless thing as it never conveys a true idea, it only gra∣tifies the imagination with a fantastick one, until the real one is seen. So, my dear, if you have a mind to form a true notion of the divine form, and features of the Venus and Antinous, come to Florence.</P>
<P>I would be glad to oblige you and your friend Vertue by executing your commis∣sion with respect to the sketches of Ra∣phaels cartoons at Hampton-Court; but I cannot do it to my satisfaction. I have, indeed, seen in the Grand Dukes collection, four pieces, in which that won∣derful artist had thrown freely from his pencil the first thoughts and rude lines of some of these compositions; and as the first thoughts of a great genius are preci∣ous, these pieces attracted my curiosity in a particular manner; but when I went to examine them closely, I found them so damaged and effaced, that they did not at all answer my expectation. Whether this be owing to negligence or envy, I can∣not

<HEAD>LETTER LVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>TO Mr. P—.</HEAD>
<P>I Have been running about Paris at a strange rate with my sister, and strange sights have we seen. They are at least strange sights to me, for after having been accustomed to the gravity of Turks, I can scarcely look with an easy and familiar aspect at the levi∣ty and agility of the airy phantoms that are dancing about me here, and I often think that I am at a puppet-shew amidst the representations of real life. I stare pro∣digiously but no body remarks it, for eve∣ry body stares here; staring is alamode—there is a stare of attention and <HI>interét,</HI> a stare of curiosity, a stare of expectation, a
<PB N="27" REF="011340_0033_0F86A07D626F2B98"/>
stare of surprize, it would greatly amuse you to see what trifling objects excite all this staring. This staring would have rather a solemn kind of air, were it not alleviated by grinning, for at the end of a stare there comes always a grin, and very com∣monly the entrance of a gentleman or la∣dy into a room is accompanied with a grin, which is designed to express compla∣cence and social pleasure, but really shews nothing more than a certain contortion of muscles that must make a stranger laugh really, as they laugh artificially. The French grin is equally remote from the chearful serenity of a smile, and the cordial mirth of an honest English horse-laugh. I shall not perhaps stay here long enough to form a just idea of French manners and characters, tho' this I believe would require but little study, as there is no great depth in either. It appears, on a superficial view to be a frivolous restless and agreeable people. The Abbot is my guide, and I could not easily light upon a better; he tells me that here the women form the character of the men, and I am convinc∣ed in the persuasion of this by every com∣pany into which I enter. There seems here to be no intermediate state between infancy and manhood; for as soon as the boy has quit his leading-strings, he is set agog in the world; the ladies are his tu∣tors, they make the first impressions, which
<PB N="28" REF="011340_0034_0F86A07E024EE1A0"/>
generally remain, and they render the men ridiculous by the imitation of their humours and graces, so that dignity in manners is a rare thing here before the age of sixty. Does not King David say somewhere, that <HI>Man walketh in a vain shew?</HI> I think he does, and I am sure this is peculiarly true of the French man,—but he walks merrily and seems to enjoy the vision, and may he not therefore be esteemed more happy than many of our solid thinkers whose brows are furrowed by deep reflection, and whose wisdom is so often clothed with a misty mantle of spleen and vapours?</P>
<P>What delights me most here is a view of the magnificence often accompanied with taste that reigns in the King's palaces and gardens; for tho' I don't admire much the architecture, in which there is great irregularity amd want of proportion, yet the statues, paintings and other deco∣rations afford me high entertainment. One of the pieces of antiquity that struck me most in the gardens of Versailles was the famous Coloss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an statue of Jupi∣ter, the workmanship of Myron, which Mark Anthony carried away from Samos, and Augustus ordered to be placed in the Capitol. It is of pariah marble, and tho' it has suffered in the ruin of time it still preserves striking lines of majesty. But surely if marble could feel, the God would
<PB N="29" REF="011340_0034_0F86A07E024EE1A0"/>
frown with a generous indignation to see himself transported from the Capi∣tol into a French garden; and after hav∣ing received the homage of the Roman emperors who laid their laurels at his feet when they returned from their conquests, to behold now nothing but frizzled beaus passing by him with indifference.</P>
<P>I propose setting out soon from this place, so that you are to expect no more letters from this side of the water; besides I am hurried to death, and and my head swims with that vast variety of objects which I am obliged to view with such rapidity the shortness of my time not allowing me to examine them at my leisure. There is here an excessive prodigality of ornaments and decorations, that is just the opposite extreme to what appears in our royal gar∣dens; this prodigality is owing to the le∣vity and inconstancy of the French taste, which always pants after something new, and thus heaps ornament upon ornament without end or measure.

<HEAD>LETTER LVIII. To Count—.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Translated from the French.</HEAD>
<P>I AM charmed, sir, with your obliging letter; and you may perceive by the largeness of my paper, that I intend to give punctual answers to all your questi∣ons, at least if my French will permit me; for as it is a language I do not understand to perfection, so I much fear, that, for want of expressions, I shall be quickly o∣bliged to finish. Keep in mind, therefore, that I am writing in a foreign language; and be sure to attribute all the impertinen∣cies and triflings dropping from my pen, to the want of proper words for declaring my thoughts, but by no means to dulness or natural levity.</P>
<P>These conditions being thus agreed and settled, I begin with telling you, that you have a true notion of the Alcoran, con∣cerning which the Greek priests (who are the greatest scoundrels in the universe) have invented out of their own heads a thousand ridiculous stories, in order to decry the law of Mahomet; to run it down, I say, without any examination,
<PB N="31" REF="011340_0035_0F86A07EB9B57FA0"/>
or so much as letting the people read it; being afraid that if once they began to sift the defects of the Alcoran, they might not stop there, but proceed to make use of their judgment, about their own legends and fictions. In effect, there is nothing so like as the fables of the Greeks and of the Mahometans; and the last have multitudes of saints, at whose tombs miracles are by them said to be daily performed; nor are the accounts of the lives of those blessed Musselmen much less stuffed with extravagancies, than the spiritual romances of the Greek Pa∣pas.</P>
<P>As to your next enquiry, I assure you 'tis certainly false, though commonly be∣lieved in our parts of the world, that Ma∣homet excludes women from any share in a future happy state. He was too much a gentleman, and loved the fair sex too well, to use them so barbarously. On the con∣trary, he promises a very fine paradise to the Turkish women. He says, indeed, that this paradise will be a separate place from that of their husbands; but I, fancy the most part of them won't like it the worse for that; and that the re∣gret of this separation will not rende their paradise the less agreeable. It re∣mains to tell you, that the virtues which Mahomet requires of the women, to me∣rit the enjoyment of future happiness, are
<PB N="32" REF="011340_0036_0F86A07F8DAC88B8"/>
not to live in such a manner as to be∣come useless to the world, but to employ themselves as much as possible, in making little Mussulmans, The virgins who die virgins, and the widows who marry not again, dying in mortal sin, are excluded out of paradise: For women, says he not being capable to manage the affairs of state, nor to support the fatigues of war, God has not ordered them to govern or reform the world; but he has entrusted them with an office which is no less honou∣ble, even that of multiplying the human race: and such as▪ out of malice or la∣ziness, do not make it their business to bear or breed children, fulfill not the duty of their vocation, and rebel against the commands of God. Here are maxims for you, prodigiously contrary to those of your convents. What will become of your St. Catharines, your St. Theresas, your St. Claras, and the whole bead roll of your holy virgins and widows? who, if they are to be judged by this system of virtue, will be found to have been infamous creatures, that passed their whole lives in the most abominable libertinism.</P>
<P>I know not what your thoughts may be concernin a doctrine so extraordinary with respect to us; but I can truly inform you, sir, that the Turks are not so igno∣rant as we fancy them to be, in mat∣ters of politicks, or philosophy, or even
<PB N="33" REF="011340_0036_0F86A07F8DAC88B8"/>
of gallantry. 'Tis true that military dis∣cipline, such as is now practised in Chri∣stendom, does not mightily suit them. A long peace has plunged them into an uni∣versal sloth. Content with their condition, and accustomed to boundless luxury, they are become great enemies to all manner of fatigues. But to make amends, the sci∣ences flourish among them. The effendis (that is to say, the learned) do very well deserve this name: They have no more faith in the inspirations of Mahomet, than in the infallibility of the Pope. They make a frank profession of deism among themselves, or to those they can trust, and never speak of their law but as of a po∣litick institution, fit now to be observed by wise men, however at first introduced by politicians and enthusiasts.</P>
<P>If I remember right, I think I have told you in some former letter, that at Belgrade we lodged with a great and rich Effendi, a man of wit and learning, and of a very agreeable humour. We were in his house about a month, and he did constantly eat with us, drinking wine with∣out any scruple. As I rallied him a little on this subject, he answered me, smiling, that all creatures in the world were made for the pleasure of man; and that God would not have let the vine grow, were it a sin to taste of its juice: but that ne∣vertheless the law, which forbids the use
<PB N="34" REF="011340_0037_0F86A083E47E3578"/>
of it to the vulgar, was very wise, because such sort of folks have not sense enough to take it with moderation. This Effendi appeared no stranger to the parties that prevail among us: nay, he seemed to have some knowledge of our religious dis∣putes, and even of our writers, and I was surprised to hear him ask among other things how Mr. Toland did?</P>
<P>My paper, large as it is, draws towards an end. That I may not go beyond its limits, I must leap from religions to tu∣lips, concerning which you ask me news. Their mixture produces surprizing effects But what is to be observed most surpriz∣ing, is the experiments of which you speak concerning animals, and which is tried here every day. The suburbs of Pera, Jophana, and Galata, are collecti∣ons of strangers from all countries of the universe. They have so often intermar∣ried, that this forms several races of peo∣ple, the oddest imaginable, there is not one single family of natives, that can va∣lue itself on being unmixed. You fre∣quently see a person, whose father was born a Grecian, the mother an Italian, the grandfather a Frenchman, the grand∣mother an Armenian, and their ancestors English, Muscovites, Asiaticks, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This mixture produces creatures more extraordinary than you can imagine: nor could I ever doubt, but there were se∣veral
<PB N="35" REF="011340_0037_0F86A083E47E3578"/>
different species of men; since the whites, the woolly and the long hair'd blacks, the small-eyed Tartars and Chi∣nese, the beardless Brasilians (and to name name no more) the oily-skinned yellow Nova Zemblians, have as specific differen∣ces under the same general kind, as grey∣hounds, mastiffs, spaniels, bull dogs, or the race of my little Diana, if nobody is of∣fended at the comparison. Now as the va∣rious intermixing of these later animals causes mungrels, so mankind have their mungrels too, divided and subdivided into endless sorts. We have daily proofs of it here, as I told you before. In the same animal is not seldom remarked the Greek perfidiousness, and the Italian diffidence, the Spanish arrogance and the French lo∣quacity, and all of a sudden he is seized with a fit of English thoughtfulness, border∣ing a little upon dullness, which many of us have inherited from the stupidity of our Saxon progenitors. But the family which charms me most, is that which proceeds from the fantastical conjunction of a Dutch male with a Greek female. As these are natures opposite in extremes, 'tis a plea∣sure to observe how the differing attoms are perpetually jarring together in the chil∣dren, even so as to produce effects visi∣ble in their external form. They have the large black eyes of the country, with the fat, white, fishy flesh of Holland, and
<PB N="36" REF="011340_0038_0F86A08460453B00"/>
a lively air streaked with dullness. At one and the same time, they shew that love of expensiveness, so universal among the Greeks, and an inclination to the Dutch frugality. To give an example of this: young women ruin themselves to purchase jewels for adorning their heads, while they have not the heart to buy new shoes or rather slippers for their feet, which are commonly in a tattered con∣dition; a thing so contrary to the taste of our English women that it is for shew∣ing how neatly their feet are dressed, and for shewing this only they are so passio∣nately enamoured with their hoop-peti∣coats. I have abundance of other singu∣larities to communicate to you, but I am at the end both of my French and my paper.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD>ON MARRIAGE.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Containing a Refutation of one Maxim of the Duke De La Roche Foucault's—"That Marriage is sometimes con∣venient, but never delightful."</HEAD>
<P>IT may be thought a presumptuous at tempt in me to contravert a maxim advanced by such a celebrated geni∣us
<PB N="37" REF="011340_0038_0F86A08460453B00"/>
us as Monsieur Rochefoucault, and re∣ceived with such implicit faith by a nati∣on which boasts of superior politeness to the rest of the world, and which for a long time past has prescribed the rules of gallantry to all Europe.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, prompted by that ardour which truth inspires, I dare to maintain the contrary, and resolutely insist, that there are some marriages formed by love, which may be delightful, where the affection are sympathetic. Nature has presented us with pleasures suitable to our species, and we need only to follow her impulse, re∣fined by taste, and exalted by a lively and agreeable imagination, in order to attain the most perfect felicity of which human nature is susceptible: ambition, avarice, va∣nity when enjoy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d in the most exquisite perfection, can yield but trifling and taste less pleasures, which will be too incon∣siderable to affect a mind of d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e sensibility.</P>
<P>We may consider the gifts of fortune as so many steps necessary to arrive at fe∣licity, which we can never attain, being obliged to set bounds to our desires, and being only gratified with some of her frivolous favours; which are nothing more than the torments of life, when they are considered as the necessary means to acquire or preserve a more exquisite felicity.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="011340_0039_0F86A084C7C08AF8"/>
This felicity consists alone in friendship, founded on mutual esteem, fixed by gra∣titude, supported by inclination, and ani∣mated by the tender solicitudes of Love, whom the ancients have admirably described under the appearance of a beautiful infant: it is pleased with infantine amusements, it is delicate and affectionate, incapable of mischief, delighted with trifles; its pleasures are gentle and innocent.</P>
<P>They have given a very different repre∣sentation of another passion too gross to be mentioned, but of which alone men in gene∣ral are susceptible. This they have described under the figure of a Satyr, who has more of the brute than of the man in his composi∣tion. By this fabulous animal they have ex∣pressed a passion, which is the real founda∣tion of all the fine exploits of modish gallan∣try, and which only endeavours to glut its appetite with the possession of the object which is most lovely in its estimation: a pas∣sion founded in injustice, supported by deceit and atttended by crimes, remorse, jealousy and contempt. Can such an affection be delightful to a virtuous mind? Nevertheless such is the delightful attendant on all illicit engagements; gallants are obliged to aban∣don all those sentiments of honour which are inseparable from a liberal education, and are doomed to live wretchedly in the con∣stant pursuit of what reason condemns to have all their pleasures embittered by
<PB N="39" REF="011340_0039_0F86A084C7C08AF8"/>
remorse, and to be reduced to the deplo∣rable condition of having renounced virtue, without being able to make vice agreeable.</P>
<P>It is impossible to taste the delights of love in perfection, but in a well assorted marriage; nothing betrays such a narrow∣ness of mind as to be governed by words. What though custom, for which good rea∣sons may be assigned, has made the words <HI>husband</HI> and <HI>wife</HI> somewhat ridiculous? A husband in common acceptation, signifies a jealous brute, a surly tyrant; or at best a weak fool, who may be made to believe any thing. A wife is a domestic terma∣gant who is destined to deceive or torment the poor devil of a husband. The conduct of many married people too much reali∣zes these two odious characters.</P>
<P>But as I said before, Why should words impose upon us? A well regulated marri∣age is not like these connections of inter∣est or ambition. A fond couple attached to each other by mutual affection, are two lovers who live happily together. Though the priest pronounces certain words, though the lawyer draws up cer∣tain instruments; yet I look on these preparatives in the same light as a lover considers a ladder of ropes which he fastens to his mistress's window: if they can but live together what does it signify at what price or by what means their union is accomplished? Where love is real and well
<PB N="40" REF="011340_0040_0F86A085768ECC00"/>
founded, it is impossible to be happy but in the quiet enjoyment of the beloved object and the price at which it is ob∣tained does not lessen the vivacity and delights of a passion such as my ima∣gination conceives. If I was inclined to romance, I would not picture images of true happiness in Arcadia. I am not pru∣dish enough to confine the delicacy of affection on to wishes only I would open my romance with the marriage of a cou∣ple united by sentiment, taste and incli∣nation. Can we conceive a higher felici∣ty than the blending of their interests and lives in such an union? The lover has the pleasure of giving his mistress the la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> tes∣timony of esteem and confidence, and she in return commits her peace and liberty to his protection. Can they exchange more dear and affectionate pledges? Is it not natural, to give the most incontestable proofs of that tenderness with which our minds are impressed? I am sensible that some are so nice as to maintain that the pleasures of love are derived from the dangers and difficulties with which it is attended; they very pertly observe, that a rose would not appear a rose with∣out thorns. There are a thousand insipid remarks of this sort which make so little impression on me, that I am persuaded, was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> lover, the dread of injuring my mistress would make me unhappy, if the
<PB N="41" REF="011340_0040_0F86A085768ECC00"/>
enjoyment of her was attended with dan∣ger to herself,</P>
<P>Two married lovers lead very differ∣ent lives; they have the pleasures to pass their time in a successive intercourse of mutual obligations, and marks of bene∣volence, and they have the delight to find that each forms the entire happiness of the beloved object. Herein consists per∣fect felicity. The most trivial concerns of oeconomy become noble and elegant when they are exalted by sentiments of affecti∣on; to furnish an appartment, is not barely to furnish an apartment; it is a place where I expect my lover: to prepare a supper, is not merely giving orders to my cook; it is an amusement to regale the object I doa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on. In this light a wo∣man considers these necessary occupati∣ons as more lively and affecting pleasures▪ than those gaudy sights which amuse the greater part of the sex, who are incapa∣ble of true enjoyment.</P>
<P>A fixed and affectionate attachment sof∣tens every emotion of the soul, and ren∣ders every object agreeable which presents itself to the happy lover (I mean one who is married to his mistress.) If he ex∣ercises any employment, the fatigues of the camp the troubles of the court, all become agreeable when he reflects that he endures these inconveniencies to serve the object of his affections. If fortune is
<PB N="42" REF="011340_0041_0F86A086A8692378"/>
favourable to him, for success does not depend on merit, all the advantages it procures are so many tributes which he thinks due to the charms of the lovely fair; and in gratifying this ambition, he feels a more lively pleasure, and more worthy of an honest man, than that of raising his fortune, and gaining public applause. He enjoys glory, titles and rich∣es no farther than as they regard her he loves; and when he attracts the approba∣tion of a senate the applause of an army, or the commendation of his prince, it is her praises which ultimately flatter him.</P>
<P>In a reverse of fortune, he has the con∣solation of retiring to one who is affect∣ed by his disgrace; and locked in her embraces he has the satisfaction of giving utterance to the following tender reflec∣tions. <Q>My happiness does not depend on the caprice of fortune; I have a con∣stant assylum against inquietude. Your esteem renders me insensible of the in∣justice of a court, or the ingratitude of a master and my losses afford me a kind of pleasure, since they furnish me with fresh proofs of your virtue and affecti∣on. Of what use is grandeur to those who are already happy? We have no need of flatterers, we want no equipag∣es, I reign in your affections, and I en∣joy every delight in the possession of your person.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="011340_0041_0F86A086A8692378"/>
In short there is no situation in which melancholy may not be assuaged by the company of the beloved object. Sickness itself is not without its alleviation, when we have the pleasure of being attended by her we love. I should never conclude, if I attempted to give a detail of all the delights of an attachment, wherein we meet with every thing which can flatter the sens∣es with the most lively and diffusive rap∣tures. But I must not omit taking notice of the pleasure of beholding the lovely pledges of a tender friendship, daily grow∣ing up, and of amusing ourselves, accord∣ing to our different sexes, in training them to perfection We give way to this agree∣able instinct of nature, refined by love. In a daughter we praise the beauty of her mother: in a son we commend the un∣derstanding, and the appearance of innate probity which we esteem in his father. It is a pleasure which according to Moses, the Almighty himself enjoyed, when he beheld the work of his hands, and saw that all was good.</P>
<P>Speaking of Moses. I cannot forbear ob∣serving that the primitive plan of felicity infinitely surpasses all others, and I can∣not form an idea of Paradise, more like a Paradise than the state in which our first parents were placed: that proved of short duration, because they were unacquainted with the world, and it is for the same
<PB N="44" REF="011340_0042_0F86A0874F2FFC38"/>
reason that so few love matches prove hap∣py. Eve was like a silly child, and Adam was not much enlightened. When such people come together, their being amo∣rous is to no purpose, for their affections must necessarily be short lived. In the transports of their love they form supper-natural ideas of each other. The man thinks his mistress an angel because she is hand∣some, and she is enraptured with the me∣rit of her lover, because he adores her. The first decay of her complexion depri∣ves her of his adoration, and the husb∣and being no longer an adorer, becomes hateful to her, who had no other foun∣dation for her love. By degrees they grow disgustful to each other, and after the example of our first parents they do not fail to reproach each other with the crime of their mutual imbecillity. After indiffer∣ence contempt comes apace, and they are convinced that they must hate each other, because they are married. Their smallest de∣fects swell in each other's view, and they grow blind to those charms which, in any other object would please them. A commerce founded merely on sensation can be attended with no other consequences.</P>
<P>A man, when he marries the object of his affections, should forget that she appears to him adorable, and should consider her merely as a mortal, subject to disorders, caprice and ill temper; he should arm himself
<PB N="45" REF="011340_0042_0F86A0874F2FFC38"/>
with fortitude, to bear the loss of her beauty, and should provide himself with a fund of complaisance which is requisite to support a constant intercourse, with a person even of the highest understanding and the greatest equanimity. The wife, on the other hand▪ should, not expect a con∣tinued course of adulation and obedience; she should dispose herself to obey in her turn with a good grace; a science very difficult to attain, and consequently the more estimable in the opinion of a man who is sensible of the merit. She should endeavour to revive the charms of the mis∣tress, by the solidity and good sense of the friend.</P>
<P>When a pair, who entertain such rati∣onal sentiments, are united by indissolu∣ble bonds all nature smiles upon them, and the most common objects appear de∣lightful. In my oppinion, such a life is infinitely more happy and more volup∣tuous, than the most ravishing and best regulated gallantry.</P>
<P>A woman who is capable of reflection can consider a gallant in no other light than that of a seducer who would take ad∣vantage of her weakness, to procure a mo∣mentary pleasure at the expence of her glory, her peace her honour, and perhaps her life. A highwayman who claps a pistol to your breast, to rob you of your purse, is less dishonest and less guilty; and I have
<PB N="46" REF="011340_0043_0F86A087C6293988"/>
so good an opinion of myself as to believe that if I was a man, I should be as capable of assuming the character of an assassin, as that of seducing an honest woman, esteem∣ed in the world and happy in her hus∣band, by attempting to inspire her with a passion to which she must sacrifice her honour, her tranquillity and her virtue.</P>
<P>Should I make her despicable, who ap∣pears amiable in my eyes? Should I reward her tenderness, by making her abhorred by her family, by rendering her children indifferent to her, and her husband detestable? I believe that these re∣flections would have appeared to me in as strong a light, it my sex had not ren∣dered them excusable in such cases; and I hope that I should have had more sense than to imagine vice the less vicious, be∣cause it is the fashion.</P>
<P>N. B. I am much pleased with the Turkish manners: a people, though igno∣rant, yet, in my judgment, extremely po∣lite. A gallant convicted of having de∣bauched a married woman, is regarded as a pernicious being, and held in the same abhorrence as a prostitute with us. He is certain of never making his fortune, and they would deem it scandalous to confer any considerable employment on a man suspected of having committed such enormous injustice.</P>
<P>What would these moral people think
<PB N="47" REF="011340_0043_0F86A087C6293988"/>
of our anti-knights-errant, who are ever in pursuit of adventures to reduce inno∣cent virgins to distress, and to rob vir∣tuous women of their honour; who re∣gard beauty, youth, rank, nay virtue itself as so many incentives, which inflame their desires, and render their efforts more eager; and who, priding themselves in the glory of appearing expert seducers, forget that with all their endeavours, they can only acquire the second rank in that ignoble order the Devil having long since been in possession of the first.</P>
<P>Our barbarous manners are so well calculated for the establishment of vice and wretchedness, which are ever inseparable, that it requires a degree of understand∣ing and sensibility infinitely above the common, to relish the felicity of a mar∣riage such as I have described. Nature is so weak and so prone to change, that it is difficult to maintain the best grounded constancy, in the midst of those dissipa∣tions, which our ridiculous customs have rendered unavoidable.</P>
<P>It must pain an amorous husband to see his wife take all that fashionable liber∣ties; it seems harsh not to allow them and to be conformable he is reduced to the necessity of letting every one take them that will, to hear her impart the charms of her understanding to all the world, to see her display her bosom at

noon day, to see her bedeck herself for the ball, and for the play, and attract a thousand and a thousand adorers, and lis∣ten to the insipid flattery of a thousand and a thousand coxcombs. Is it possi∣ble to preserve an esteem for such a crea∣ture, or at least must not her value be greatly diminished by such a commerce?</P>
<P>I must still resort to the maxims of the East, where the most beautiful women are content to confine the power of their charms to him who has a right to en∣joy them; and they are too sincere not to confess, that they think themselves ca∣pable of exciting desires.</P>
<P>I recollect a conversation that I had with a lady of great quality at Constan∣tinople, (the most amiable woman I ever knew in my life and with whom I after wards contracted the closest friendship.) She frankly acknowledged that she was satisfied with her husband. What libertines said she you Christian ladies are! You are permitted to receive visits from as many men as you think proper, and your laws allow you the unlimited use of love and wine. I assured her that she was wrong informed, and that it was criminal to lis∣ten to, or to love, any other than our husbands. <Q>Your husbands are great fools she replied smiling▪ to be content with so precarious a fidelity. Your necks, your eyes, your hands, your conversa∣tion

are all for the publick, and what do you pretend to reserve for them? Pardon me, my pretty Sultana, she ad∣ded, embracing me, I have a strong in∣clination to believe all that you tell me but you would impose impossibilities up∣on me I know the filthiness of the in∣fidels; I perceive that you are asham∣ed, and I will say no more.</Q></P>
<P>I found so much good sense and pro∣priety in what she said, that I knew not how to contradict her, and at length I ac∣knowledged that she had reason to prefer the Mahometan manners to our ridiculous customs which form a confused medley of the rigid maxims of Christianity, with all the libertinism of the Spartans: And notwithstanding our absurd manners, I am persuaded that a woman who is determin∣ed to place her happiness in her husbands affections, should abandon the extravagant desire o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> engaging public adoration; and that a husband who tenderly loves his wife should in his turn, give up the re∣putation of being a gallant. You find that I am supposing a very extraordinary pair; it is not very surprizing therefore, that such an union should be uncommon in those countries, where it is requisite to despise established customs in order to be happy.</P>

<LG>
<L>GIVE, me, great God! said I, a litle farm,</L>
<L>In Summer shady, and in Winter warm;</L>
<L>Where a clear spring gives birth to murm'ring brooks</L>
<L>By nature gliding down the mossy rocks.</L>
<L>Not artfully by leaden pipes convey'd,</L>
<L>Or greatly falling in a forc'd cascade,</L>
<L>Pure and unsully'd Winding thro' the shade.</L>
<L>All bounteous Heaven has added to my prayer,</L>
<L>A softer climate and a purer air.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our frozen Isle now chilling Winter binds,</L>
<L>Deform'd by rains and rough with blasting winds;</L>
<L>The wither'd woods grow white with hoary frost,</L>
<L>By driving storms, their verdant beauty lost;</L>
<L>The trembling birds their leafless covert shun,</L>
<L>And seek in distant climes a warmer sun:</L>
<L>The water nymphs their silent urns deplore,</L>
<L>Ev'n Thames benumb'd's a river now no more;</L>
<L>The batten meads no longer yield delight,</L>
<L>By glistening snows made painful to the sight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here Summer reigns with one eternal smile,</L>
<L>Succeeding harvests bless the happy soil.</L>
<L>Fair fertile fields to whom indulgent Heaven</L>
<L>Has ev'ry charm of ev'ry season given,</L>
<L>No killing cold deforms the beauteous year,</L>
<L>The springing flowers no coming winter fear.</L>
<L>But as the parent Rose decays and dies,</L>
<L>The infant buds wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> brighter colour rise,</L>
<L>And with fresh sweets the mother, scent supplies.</L>
<L>Near them the Violet grows with odours blest,</L>
<L>And blooms in more than Tyrian purple drest;</L>
<L>The rich Jonquils their golden beams display,</L>
<L>And shine in glories emulating day;</L>
<L>The peaceful groves their verdant leaves retain,</L>
<L>The streams still murmur, undefil'd with rain,</L>
<L>And tow'ring greens adorn the fruitful plain,</L>
<L>The warbling-kind uninterrupted sing,</L>
<L>Warm'd with enjoyments of perpetual Spring.</L>

<L>In distant views the <HI>As<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> mountains rise,</L>
<L>And lose their snowy summits in the skies:</L>
<L>Above those mountains proud Olympus towers,</L>
<L>The parliamental seat of heavenly powers.</L>
<L>New to the sight my, ravish'd eyes admire</L>
<L>Each gilded crescent and each antique spire,</L>
<L>The marble mosques beneath whose ample domes</L>
<L>Fierce warlike Sultans sleep in peaceful tombs;</L>
<L>Those lofty structures once the Christian's boast,</L>
<L>Their names their beauty, and their honours lost</L>
<L>Those altars bright with gold and sculpture grac'd,</L>
<L>By barb'rous zeal of savage foes defac'd;</L>
<L>Sophia alone her ancient name retains,</L>
<L>Tho' unbelieving vows her shrine profanes;</L>
<L>Where holy saints have dy'd in sacred cells,</L>
<L>Where monarch's pray'd the frantick Dervise dwells.</L>
<L>How art thou fall'n, imperial city low!</L>
<L>Where are thy hopes of Roman glory now?</L>
<L>Where are thy palaces by prelates rais'd.</L>
<L>Where Grecian artists all their skill display'd</L>
<L>Before the happy sciences decay'd;</L>
<L>So vast that youthful kings might here reside,</L>
<L>So splendid to content a patriarch's pride;</L>
<L>Convents where emperors profess'd of old,</L>
<L>Their labour'd pillars that their triumphs told;</L>
<L>Vain monuments of them that once were great,</L>
<L>Sunk undistinguish'd by one common fate,</L>
<L>One little spot the tenure small contains</L>
<L>Of Greek nobility the poor remains.</L>
<L>Where other Helens with like powerful charms,</L>
<L>Has once engag'd the warring world in arms;</L>
<L>Those names which royal ancestors can boast,</L>
<L>In mean mechanick arts obscurely lost;</L>
<L>Those eves a second Homer might inspire,</L>
<L>Fix'd at the loom destroy their useless fire;</L>
<L>Griev'd at a view which struck upon my mind</L>

<L>The proud Vizie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> distinguish'd o'er the rest;</L>
<L>Six slaves in gay attire his bridle hold,</L>
<L>His bridle rich with gems his stirrups gold;</L>
<L>His snowy steed adorn'd with costly pride,</L>
<L>Whole troops of soldiers mounted by his side,</L>
<L>These top the plummy crest arabian courtiers guide.</L>
<L>With artful duty all decline their eyes,</L>
<L>No bellowing shouts of noisy crouds arise;</L>
<L>Silence in solemn state the march attends,</L>
<L>Till at the dread divan the slow procession ends.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet not these prospects all profusely gay,</L>
<L>The gilded navy that adorns the sea,</L>
<L>The rising city in confusion fair,</L>
<L>Magnificently form'd irregular:</L>
<L>Where woods and palaces at once surprize,</L>
<L>Gardens on gardens, domes on domes arise,</L>
<L>And endless beauties tire the wand'ring eyes:</L>
<L>So sooth my wishes, or so charm my mind,</L>
<L>As this retreat secure from human-kind.</L>
<L>No knave's successful craft does spleen excite,</L>
<L>No coxcomb's taudry splendour shocks my sight;</L>
<L>No mob alarm awakes my female fear,</L>
<L>No praise my mind nor envy hurts my ear,</L>
<L>Ev'n fame itself can hardly reach me here:</L>
<L>Impertinence with all her tattling train,</L>
<L>Fair-sounding flattery's delicious bane;</L>
<L>Censorious folly, noisy party-rage</L>
<L>The thousand tongues with which she must engage,</L>
<L>Who dares have virtue in a vicious age.</L>

<L>SEE how that pair of billing doves</L>

<LG>
<L>WIFE and servant are the same,</L>
<L>But only differ in the name:</L>
<L>For when that fatal knot is ty'd,</L>
<L>Which nothing, nothing can divide:</L>
<L>When she the word obey has said,</L>
<L>And man by law supreme is made,</L>
<L>Then all that's kind is laid aside,</L>
<L>And nothing left but state and pride:</L>
<L>Fierce as an eastern Prince he grows,</L>
<L>And all his innate rigour shews:</L>
<L>Then but to look or laugh or speak.</L>
<L>Will the nuptial contract break.</L>
<L>Like mutes she signs alone must make,</L>
<L>And never any freedom take:</L>
<L>But still be govern'd by a nod▪</L>
<L>And fear her husband as her God:</L>
<L>Him still must serve, him still obey,</L>
<L>And nothing act, and nothing say,</L>
<L>But what her haughty Lord thinks fit,</L>
<L>Who with the power, has all the wit.</L>
<L>Then shun, Oh! shun that wretched state,</L>
<L>And all the fawning flatterers hate:</L>

<LG>
<L>REMOTE, unfriended, melancholy, slow,</L>
<L>Or by the lazy Scheld, or wand'ring Po;</L>
<L>Or onward, where the rude Carinthian boor,</L>
<L>Against the houseless stranger shuts the door;</L>
<L>Or where Campania's plain forsaken lies,</L>
<L>A weary waste expanded to the skies.</L>
<L>Where'er I roam, whatever realms I see,</L>
<L>My heart untravell'd fondly turns to thee;</L>
<L>Still to my brother turns, with ceaseless pain,</L>
<L>And drags at each remove a lengthening chain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Eternal blessings crown my earliest friend,</L>
<L>And round his dwelling guardian saints attend;</L>
<L>Blest be that spot, where chearful guests retire</L>
<L>To pause from toil, and trim their evening fire;</L>
<L>Blest that abode, where want and pain repair,</L>
<L>And every stranger finds a ready chair;</L>
<L>Blest be those feasts where mirth and peace abound,</L>
<L>Where all the ruddy family around,</L>
<L>Laugh at the jests or pranks that never fail,</L>
<L>Or sigh with pity at some mournful tale,</L>
<L>Or press the bashful stranger to his food,</L>
<L>And learn the luxury of doing good.</L>
<L>But me not destin'd such delights to share,</L>
<L>My prime of life in wand'ring spent and care:</L>
<L>Impell'd with steps, unceasing to pursue</L>
<L>Some fleeting good, that mocks me with the view;</L>
<L>That, like the circle bounding earth and skies;</L>
<L>Allures from far, yet, as I follow flies;</L>
<L>My fortune leads to traverse realms unknown,</L>
<L>And find no spot of all the world my own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Even now, where Alpine solitudes ascend,</L>
<L>I sit me down a pensive hour to spend;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="011340_0051_0F86A08FF418BF08"/>
And, plac'd on high above the storms career,</L>
<L>Look downward where an hundred realms appear;</L>
<L>Lakes, forests, cities, plains extended wide,</L>
<L>The pomp of kings, the shepherd's humble pride.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When thus Creation's charms around combine,</L>
<L>Amidst the store, 'twere thankless to repine,</L>
<L>'Twere affectation, all, and school-taught pride,</L>
<L>To spurn the splendid things by heaven supply'd.</L>
<L>Let school-taught pride dissemble all it can,</L>
<L>These little things are great to little men;</L>
<L>And wiser he, whose sympathetic mind</L>
<L>Exults in all the good of all mankind.</L>
<L>Ye glittering, towns, with wealth and splendour crown'd,</L>
<L>Ye fields, where summer spreads profusion round,</L>
<L>Ye lakes, whose vessels catch the busy gale,</L>
<L>Ye bending swains, that dress the flow'ry vale,</L>
<L>For me your tributary stores combine;</L>
<L>Creation's heir, the world, the world is mine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As some lone miser visiting his store,</L>
<L>Bends at his treasure, counts, recounts it o'er;</L>
<L>Hoards after hoards his rising raptures fill,</L>
<L>Yet still he sighs, for hoards are wanting still:</L>
<L>Thus to my breast alternate passions rise,</L>
<L>Pleas'd with each good that heaven to man supplies:</L>
<L>Yet oft a sigh prevails, and sorrows fall,</L>
<L>To see the sum of human bliss so small;</L>
<L>And oft I wish, amidst the scene, to find</L>
<L>Some spot to real happiness consign'd,</L>
<L>Where my worn soul, each wand'ring hope at rest,</L>
<L>May gather bliss to see my fellows blest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet, where to find that happiest spot below,</L>
<L>Who can direct, when all pretend to know?</L>
<L>The shudd'ring tenant of the frigid zone</L>
<L>Boldly asserts that country for his own,</L>
<L>Extols the treasures of his stormy seas,</L>
<L>And live-long nights of revelry and ease;</L>
<L>The naked Negro, panting at the line,</L>
<L>Boasts of his golden sands and palmy wine,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="011340_0051_0F86A08FF418BF08"/>
Basks in the glare, or stems the tepid wave,</L>
<L>And thanks his Gods for all the good they gave,</L>
<L>Nor less the patriot's boast, where'er we roam,</L>
<L>His first best country ever is at home.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And yet, perhaps, if states with states we scan,</L>
<L>Or estimate their bliss on Reason's plan,</L>
<L>Though patriots flatter, and though fools contend,</L>
<L>We still shall find uncertainty suspend;</L>
<L>Find that each good by art or Nature given,</L>
<L>To these or those, but make the balance even:</L>
<L>Find that the bliss of all is much the same,</L>
<L>And patriotic boasting reason's shame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nature, a mother kind alike to all,</L>
<L>Still grants her bliss at Labour's earnest call;</L>
<L>And though rough rocks or gloomy summits frown,</L>
<L>These rocks, by custom, turn to beds of down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From Art more various are the blessings sent:</L>
<L>Wealth, splendour, honour, liberty, content:</L>
<L>Yet these each other's power so strong contest,</L>
<L>That either seems destructive of the rest.</L>
<L>Hence every state, to one lov'd blessing prone,</L>
<L>Conforms and models life to that alone.</L>
<L>Each to the favourite happiness attends,</L>
<L>And spurns the plan that aims at other ends:</L>
<L>Till carried to excess in each domain,</L>
<L>This favourite good begets peculiar pain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But let us view these truths with closer eyes,</L>
<L>And trace them through the prospect as it lies:</L>
<L>Here for a while my proper cares resign'd,</L>
<L>Here let me sit in sorrow for mankind,</L>
<L>Like yon neglected shrub, at random cast,</L>
<L>That shades the steep, and sighs at ever blast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Far to the right, where, Appenine ascends,</L>
<L>Bright as the summer, Italy extends;</L>
<L>Her uplands sloping deck the mountain's side,</L>
<L>Woods over woods in gay theatric pride;</L>
<L>While oft some temple's mould'ring top between,</L>
<L>With venerable grandeur marks the scene.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="011340_0052_0F86A0929E56D0B0"/>
<L>Could Nature's bounty satisfy the breast,</L>
<L>The sons of Italy were surely blest,</L>
<L>Whatever fruits in different climes are found,</L>
<L>That proudly rise or humbly court the ground,</L>
<L>Whatever blooms in torrid tracts appear,</L>
<L>Whose bright succession decks the varied year;</L>
<L>Whatever sweets salute the northern sky</L>
<L>With vernal leaves that blossom but to die;</L>
<L>These here disporting own the kindred soil,</L>
<L>Nor ask luxuriance from the planters toil;</L>
<L>While sea-born gales their gelid wings expand</L>
<L>To winnow fragrance round the smiling land.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But small the bliss that sense alone bestows,</L>
<L>And sensual bliss is all this nation knows.</L>
<L>In florid beauty groves and fields appear,</L>
<L>Men seem the only growth that dwindles here.</L>
<L>Contrasted faults through all their manners reign,</L>
<L>Though poor, luxurious, though submissive, vain,</L>
<L>Though grave yet trifling, zealous yet untrue,</L>
<L>And even in penance planning sins anew,</L>
<L>All evils here contaminate the mind</L>
<L>That opulence departed leaves behind;</L>
<L>For wealth was theirs nor far remov'd the date,</L>
<L>When commerce proudly flourish'd through the state;</L>
<L>At her command the palace learnt to rise,</L>
<L>Again the long-fall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n column sought the skies,</L>
<L>The canvass glow'd beyond even Nature warm,</L>
<L>The pregnant quarry teem'd with human form.</L>
<L>But, more unsteady than the southern gale,</L>
<L>Soon commerce turn'd on other shores her sail;</L>
<L>And late the nation found, with fruitless skill,</L>
<L>Their former strength was but plethoric ill.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet, though to fortune lost, here still abide,</L>
<L>Some splendid arts, the wrecks of former pride;</L>
<L>From which the feeble heart and long fall'n mind</L>
<L>An easy compensation seems to find.</L>
<L>Here may be seen, in bloodless pomp array'd,</L>
<L>The paste-board triumph and the cavalcade;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="011340_0052_0F86A0929E56D0B0"/>
Processions form'd for piety and love,</L>
<L>A mistress or a saint in every grove.</L>
<L>By sports like these are all their cares beguil'd,</L>
<L>The sports of children satisfy the child;</L>
<L>At sports like these, while foreign arms advance,</L>
<L>In passive ease they leave the world to chance.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When struggling virtue sinks by long controul,</L>
<L>She leaves at last or feebly mans the Soul;</L>
<L>While low delights, succeeding fast behind,</L>
<L>In happier meaness occupy the mind:</L>
<L>As in those domes, where Caesars once bore sway,</L>
<L>Defac'd by time and tottering in decay,</L>
<L>Amidst the ruin, heedless of the dead,</L>
<L>The shelter-seeking peasant builds his shed,</L>
<L>And, wond'ring man could want the larger pile,</L>
<L>Exults, and owns his cottage with a smile.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My soul, turn from them, turn we to survey</L>
<L>Where rougher climes a nobler race display,</L>
<L>Where the bleak Swiss their stormy mansions tread,</L>
<L>And force a churlish soil for scanty bread;</L>
<L>No product here the barren hills afford,</L>
<L>But man and steel, the soldier and his sword.</L>
<L>No vernal blooms their torpid rocks array,</L>
<L>But winter lingering chills the lap of May;</L>
<L>No Zephyr fondly sooths the mountain's breast,</L>
<L>But meteors glare and, stormy glooms invest.</L>
<L>Yet still, even here, content can spread a charm,</L>
<L>Redress the clime, and all its rage disarm.</L>
<L>Though poor the peasant's hut his feasts though</L>
<L>He sees his little lot, the lot of all; [small,</L>
<L>Sees no contiguous palace rear its head</L>
<L>To shame the meanness of his humble shed;</L>
<L>No costly lord the sumptuous banquet deal</L>
<L>To make him loath his vegetable meal;</L>
<L>But calm, and bred in ignorance and toil,</L>
<L>Each wish contracting, fits him to the soil.</L>
<L>Chearful at morn he wakes from short repose,</L>
<L>Breasts the keen air, and carrols as he goes;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="011340_0053_0F86A093CFFA4D30"/>
With patient angle trolls the finny deep.</L>
<L>Or drives his vent'rous plow-share to the steep;</L>
<L>Or seeks the den where snow-tracks mark the way,</L>
<L>And drags the struggling savage into day,</L>
<L>At night returning, every labour sped,</L>
<L>He sits him down the monarch of a shed;</L>
<L>Smiles by his chearful fire, and round surveys</L>
<L>His children's looks that brighten at the blaze:</L>
<L>While his lov'd partner boastful of her hoard,</L>
<L>Displays the cleanly platter on the board;</L>
<L>And haply too some pilgrim, thither led,</L>
<L>With many a tale repays the nightly bed.</L>
<L>Thus every good his native wilds impart,</L>
<L>Imprints the patriot passion on his heart,</L>
<L>Dear is that shed to which his soul conforms,</L>
<L>And dear that hill which lifts him to the storms,</L>
<L>And as a babe, when scaring sounds molest,</L>
<L>Clings close and closer to the mother's breast;</L>
<L>So the loud torrent, and the whirlwind's roar,</L>
<L>But bind him to his native mountains more.</L>
<L>These are the charms to barren states assign'd,</L>
<L>Their wants are few, their wishes all confin'd;</L>
<L>Yet let them only share the praises due,</L>
<L>If few their wants, their wishes are but few:</L>
<L>Since every want, that stimulates the breast,</L>
<L>Becomes a source of pleasure when represt,</L>
<L>Hence from such lands each pleasing science flies,</L>
<L>That first excites desires, and then supplies;</L>
<L>Unknown to them, when sensual pleasures cloy,</L>
<L>To fill the languid pause with finer joy;</L>
<L>Unknown those powers that raise the soul to flame,</L>
<L>Catch every nerve, and vibrate through the frame.</L>
<L>Their level life is but a smould'ring fire,</L>
<L>Nor quench'd by want, nor fann'd by strong desire,</L>
<L>Unfit for raptures, or, if raptures cheer</L>
<L>On some high festival of once a year,</L>
<L>In wild excess the vulgar breast takes fire,</L>
<L>Till, buried in debauch, the bliss expire.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="011340_0053_0F86A093CFFA4D30"/>
But not their joys alone thus coarsly flow,</L>
<L>Their morals, like their pleasures are but low.</L>
<L>For as refinement stops, from sire to son,</L>
<L>Unalter'd, unimprov'd their manners run,</L>
<L>And love's and friendship's finely pointed dart,</L>
<L>Full blunted from each indurated heart,</L>
<L>Some sterner virtues o'er the mountains breast</L>
<L>May sit, like falcons cow'ring on the nest;</L>
<L>But all the gentler morals, such as play</L>
<L>Through life's more cultur'd walks, and charm our way,</L>
<L>These far dispers'd, on timorous pinions fly,</L>
<L>To sport and flutter in a kinder sky.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To kinder skies, where gentler manners reign,</L>
<L>We turn; and France displays her bright domain.</L>
<L>Gay sprightly land of mirth and social ease,</L>
<L>Pleas'd with thyself, whom all the world can please,</L>
<L>How often have I led thy sportive choir,</L>
<L>With tuneless pipe, beside the murmuring Loire;</L>
<L>Where shading elms along the margin grew,</L>
<L>And freshen'd from the waves, the Zephyr flew;</L>
<L>And haply, tho' my harsh touch faltering still,</L>
<L>But mock'd all tune, and marr'd the dancer's skill;</L>
<L>Yet would the village praise my wond'rous power,</L>
<L>And dance, forgetful of the moon-tide hour.</L>
<L>Alike all ages. Dames of ancient days</L>
<L>Have led their children through the mirthful maze,</L>
<L>And the gay grandsire skill'd in gestic lore,</L>
<L>Has frisk'd beneath the burthen of threescore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So blest a life these thoughtless realms display,</L>
<L>Thus idly busy rolls their world away:</L>
<L>Theirs are those arts that mind to mind endear,</L>
<L>For honour forms the social temper here.</L>
<L>Honour, that praise which real merit gains,</L>
<L>Or even imaginary worth obtains,</L>
<L>Here passes current; paid from hand to hand,</L>
<L>It shifts in splendid traffic round the land:</L>
<L>From courts to camps, to cottages it strays,</L>
<L>And all are taught an avarice of praise;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="011340_0054_0F86A094CE0A2590"/>
They please, are pleas'd, they give to get esteem;</L>
<L>Till, seeming blest, they grow to what they seem.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But while this softer art their bliss supplies,</L>
<L>It gives their follies also room to rise;</L>
<L>For praise too dearly lov'd or warmly sought,</L>
<L>Enfeebles all internal strength of thought,</L>
<L>And the weak soul within itself unblest,</L>
<L>Leans for all pleasure on another's breast.</L>
<L>Hence ostentation here, with tawdry art,</L>
<L>Pants for the vulgar praise which fools impart;</L>
<L>Here vanity assumes her pert grimace,</L>
<L>And trims her robes of frize with copper lace,</L>
<L>Here beggar pride defrauds her daily cheer,</L>
<L>To boast one splendid banquet once a year;</L>
<L>The mind still turns where shifting fashion draws,</L>
<L>Nor weighs the solid worth of self applause.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To men of other minds my fancy flies,</L>
<L>Embosom'd in the deep where Holland lies,</L>
<L>Methinks her patient sons before me stand,</L>
<L>Where the broad ocean leans against the land,</L>
<L>And, sedulous to stop the coming tide</L>
<L>Lifts the tall rampart's artificial pride,</L>
<L>That spreads its arms against the wat'ry roar,</L>
<L>Scoops out an empire, and usurps the shore,</L>
<L>Onward methinks, and diligently slow</L>
<L>The firm connected bulwark seems to go;</L>
<L>While ocean pent, and rising o'er the pile,</L>
<L>Sees an amphibious world beneath him smile.</L>

<L>Extremes are only in the master's mind;</L>
<L>Stern o'er each bosom Reason holds her state,</L>

<L>Pride in their port, defiance in their eye,</L>

<L>By forms unfashion'd, fresh from Nature's hand.</L>
<L>Fierce in a native hardiness of soul,</L>
<L>True to imagin'd right above controul,</L>

<L>And learns to venerate himself as man.</L>

<L>Whilst over-wrought the general system feels</L>
<L>Its motions, stopt or phrenzy fires the wheels.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor this the worst. As social bonds decay,</L>
<L>As duty, love, and honour fail to sway,</L>
<L>Fictitious bonds, the bonds of wealth and law,</L>
<L>Still gather strength and force unwilling awe.</L>
<L>Hence all obedience bows to these alone,</L>
<L>And talent sinks and merit weeps unknown;</L>

<HEAD>The CHARACTER of a LOVELY WOMAN.</HEAD>
<P>I DO not know a woman in the world who seems so much formed to render a man of sense and generosity more happy in the married state than Amasia.</P>
<P>Amasia never said, or attempted to say, a sprightly thing in all her life; but she has done ten thousand generous ones; and if she is not the most conspicu∣ous figure at an assembly, she never envied or ma∣ligned those who are, her heart is all tenderness and benevolence: no success ever attended any of her acquaintance, which did not fill her bosom with the most disinterested complacency; and no misfor∣tune ever reached her knowledge, that she did not relieve or participate by her generosity. If ever she should fall into the arms of a man she loves (and I am persuaded she would esteem it the worst kind of prostitution to resign herself into any other) her whole life would be one continued series of kindness and compliance.</P>
<P>The humble opinion she has of her own uncom∣mon merit, would make her so much the more sensi∣ble of her husband's; and those little submissions on his side, which a woman of more pride and spi∣rit would consider only as a claim of right, would be esteemed by Amasia as so many additional mo∣tives to her love and gratitude.</P>

O had the archer ne'er come down</L>
<L>To ravage in a country town!</L>
<L>Or Flavia been content to stop</L>
<L>At triumphs in a Fleet-street-shop.</L>
<L>O had her eyes forgot to blaze!</L>
<L>Or Jack had wanted eyes to gaze.</L>
<L>O!—But let exclamation cease,</L>
<L>Her presence banish'd all his peace.</L>
<L>So with decorum all things carried;</L>
<L>Miss frown'd and blush'd and then was—married.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Need we expose to vulgar sight,</L>
<L>The raptures of the bridal night!</L>
<L>Need we intrude on hallow'd ground,</L>
<L>Or draw the curtains, clos'd around?</L>
<L>Let it suffice, that each had charms,</L>
<L>He clasp'd a goddess in his arms;</L>
<L>And, though she felt his usage rough,</L>
<L>Yet in a man 'twas well enough.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The honey-moon like light'ning flew,</L>
<L>The second brought its transports too,</L>
<L>A third, a fourth were not amiss;</L>
<L>The fifth was friendship mix'd with bliss:</L>
<L>But when a twelvemonth pass'd away,</L>
<L>Jack found his goddess made of clay;</L>
<L>Found half the charms that deck'd her face.</L>
<L>Arose from powder, shreds or lace;</L>
<L>But still the worst remain'd behind,</L>
<L>That very face had robb'd her mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Skill'd in no other arts was she,</L>
<L>But dressing, patching, repartee;</L>
<L>And, just as humour rose or fell,</L>
<L>By turns a slattern or a belle:</L>
<L>'Tis true she dress'd with modern grace,</L>
<L>Half naked at a ball or race;</L>
<L>But when at home, at board or bed,</L>
<L>Five greasy night caps wrap'd her head.</L>
<L>Could so much beauty condescend</L>
<L>To be a dull domestic friend?</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="011340_0057_0F86A09774045090"/>
Could any curtain lectures bring</L>
<L>To decency so fine a thing?</L>
<L>In short, by night, 'twas fits or fretting;</L>
<L>By day 'twas gadding or coquetting,</L>
<L>Fond to be seen she kept a bevy</L>
<L>Of powder'd coxcombs at her levy;</L>
<L>The 'squire and captain took their stations,</L>
<L>And twenty other near relations;</L>
<L>Jack suck'd his pipe, and often broke</L>
<L>A sigh in suffocating smoke;</L>
<L>While all their hours were pass'd between</L>
<L>Insulting repartee or spleen.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus as her faults each day were known,</L>
<L>He thinks her features coarser grown;</L>
<L>He fancies every vice she shews</L>
<L>Or thicks her lips, or points her nose:</L>
<L>Whenever rage or envy rise,</L>
<L>How wide her mouth, how wild her eyes!</L>
<L>He knows not how, but so it is</L>
<L>Her face is grown a common phyz;</L>
<L>And, tho' her fops are wond'rous civil,</L>
<L>He thinks her ugly as the devil.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, to perplex the ravell'd nooze,</L>
<L>As each a different way pursues,</L>
<L>While sullen or loquacious strife</L>
<L>Promis'd to hold them on for life,</L>
<L>That dire disease, whose ruthless power,</L>
<L>Withers the beauty's transient flower:</L>
<L>Lo the small-pox, whose horrid glare:</L>
<L>Levell'd its terrors at the fair;</L>
<L>And, rifling ev'ry youthful grace,</L>
<L>Left but the remnant of a face.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The glass, grown hateful to her sight,</L>
<L>Reflected now a perfect fright:</L>
<L>Each former art she vainly tries</L>
<L>To bring back lustre to her eyes.</L>
<L>In vain she tries her pas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and creams,</L>
<L>To smooth her skin, or hide its seams;</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="011340_0058_0F86A09ADA6A44A0"/>
Her country beaux and city cousins</L>
<L>Lovers no more; flew off by dozens:</L>
<L>The 'squire himself was seen to yield,</L>
<L>And even the captain quits the field.</L>

<L>Poor Madam now condemn'd to hack</L>
<L>The rest of life with anxious Jack,</L>

<L>Attempted pleasing him alone.</L>
<L>Jack soon was dazzl'd to behold</L>
<L>Her present face surpass the old;</L>
<L>With modesty her cheeks are dy'd,</L>

<HEAD>THE ADVENTURES OF TOM DREADNOUGHT, Who served as a SOLDIER, and also as a SAILOR, in the late WAR.</HEAD>
<P>NO observation is more common, and at the same time more true, than, That one half of the world are ignorant how the other half lives. The misfortunes of the great are held up to engage our attention; are enlarged upon in tones of declamation; and the world is called upon to gaze at the noble sufferers: the great, under the pressure of calamity, are conscious of several others
<PB N="19" REF="011340_0058_0F86A09ADA6A44A0"/>
sympathizing with their distress; and have, at once, the comfort of admiration and pity.</P>
<P>There is nothing magnanimous in bearing mis∣fortunes with fortitude, when the whole world is looking on: men in such circumstances will act bravely even from motives of vanity; but he who, in the vale of obscurity, can brave adversity; who, without friends to encourage, acquaintances to pity, or even without hope to alleviate his misfortunes, can behave with tranquillity and indifference is truly great: whether peasant or courtier, he deserves ad∣miration, and should be held up for our imitation and respect.</P>
<P>While the slightest inconveniencies of the great are magnified into calamities! while tragedy mouths out their sufferings in all the strains of eloquence, the miseries of the poor are entirely disregarded; and yet some of the lower ranks of people undergo more real hardships in one day, than those of a more exalted station suffer in their whole lives. It is in∣conceivable what difficulties the meanest of our com∣mon sailors and soldiers endure without murmuring or regret; without passionately declaiming against Providence, or calling their fellows to be gazers on their intrepidity. Every day is to them a day of misery, and yet they entertain their hard fate with∣out repining.</P>
<P>With what indignation do I hear an Ovid, a Cicero, or a Rabutin, complain of their misfortunes and hardships, whose greatest calamity was that of being unable to visit a certain spot of earth, to which they had foolishly attached an Idea of happiness. Their distresses were pleasures, compared to what many of the adventuring poor every day endure without murmuring. They eat, drank, and slept, they had slaves to attend them, and were sure of subsistence for life: while many of their fellow-crea∣tures are obliged to wander without a friend to com∣fort
<PB N="20" REF="011340_0059_0F86A09C0BA7A098"/>
or assist them, and even without shelter from the severity of the season.</P>
<P>I have been led into these reflections from acci∣dentally meeting, some days ago, a poor fellow, whom I knew when a boy, dressed in a sailor's jac∣ket, and begging at one of the outlets of the town, with a wooden leg. I knew him to have been ho∣nest and industrious when in the country, and was curious to learn what had reduced him to his present situation. Wherefore, after giving him what I thought proper, I desired to know the history of his life and misfortunes, and the manner in which he was reduc∣ed to his present distress. The disabled soldier, for such he was, though dressed in a sailor's habit, scratch∣ing his head, and leaning on his crutch, put himself into an attitude to comply with my request, and gave me his history, as follows.</P>
<Q><P>As for my misfortunes, master, I can't pretend to have gone through any more than other folks; for, except the loss of my limb, and my being obliged to beg, I don't know any reason thank Hea∣ven, that I have to complain; there is Bill Tibbs, of our regiment, he has lost both his legs, and an eye to boot; but thank Heaven, it is not so bad with me yet.</P>
<P>I was born in Shropshire, my father was a la∣bourer, and died when I was five years old, so I was put upon the parish. As he had been a wandering sort of a man, the parishioners were not able to tell to what parish I belonged, or where I was born, so they sent me to another parish, and that parish sent me to a third. I thought in my heart, they kept sending me about so long, that they would not let me be born in any parish at all; but, at last however, they fixed me. I had some disposition to be a scholar, and was resolved, at least, to know my letters; but the master of the work∣house put me to business as soon as I was able to
<PB N="21" REF="011340_0059_0F86A09C0BA7A098"/>
handle a mallet; and here I lived an easy kind of life for five years. I only wrought ten hours in the day, and had my meat and drink provided for my labour. It is true I was not suffered to stir out of the house, for fear, as they said, I should run away; but what of that, I had the liberty of the whole house, and the yard before the door, and that was enough for me. I was then bound out to a farmer, where I was up both early and late; but I eat and drank well, and liked my business well enough, till he died, when I was obliged to provide for myself, so I was resolved to go seek my fortune.</P>
<P>In this manner I went from town to town, worked when I could get employment, and starved when I could get none: when happening one day to go through a field belonging to a justice of peace, I spyed a hare crossing the path just before me; and I believe the devil put it in my head to fling my stick at it:—Well what will you have on't? I killed the hare, and was bringing it away, when the justice himself met me, he called me a poacher and villain; and collaring me, de∣sired I would give an account of myself: I fell upon my knees, begged his worship's pardon, and began to give a full account of all that I knew of my breed, seed and generation; but, though I gave a very true account, the justice said I could give no account at all; so I was indicted at sessions, found guilty of being poor, and sent up to London to Newgate, in order to be transported as a vagabond.</P>
<P>People may say this and that of being in jail; but, for my part, I found Newgate as agreeable a place as ever I was in, in all my life. I had my belly full to eat and drink, and did no work at all. This kind of life was too good to last for ever; so I was taken out of prison, after five months, put on board a ship and sent off with two hundred more
<PB N="22" REF="011340_0060_0F86A09CB642B770"/>
to the plantations. We had but an indifferent passage, for, being all confined in the hold, more than a hundred of our people died for want of sweet air; and those that remained were sickly enough God knows. When we came a-shore we were sold to the planters, and I was bound for seven years more. As I was no scholar, for I did not know my letters, I was obliged to work among the negroes; and I served out my time, as in duty bound to do.</P>
<P>When my time was expired, I worked my pas∣sage home, and glad I was to see Old England again, because I loved my country. I was afraid, however, that I should be indicted for a vagabond once more, so I did not much care to go down into the country, but kept about the town, and did little jobs when I could get them.</P>
<P>I was very happy in this manner for some time, till one evening, coming home from work, two men knocked me down, and then bid me stand. They belonged to a press gang: I was carried be∣fore the justice, and, as I could give no account of myself, I had my choice left whether to go on board a man of war, or list for a soldier. I chose the latter; and in this post of a gentleman, I serv∣ed two campaigns in Flanders, was at the bat∣tles of Val and Fontenoy, and received but one wound, through the breast here; but the doctor of our regiment soon made me well again.</P>
<P>When the peace came on I was discharged; and as I could not work, because my wound was some∣times troublesome, I listed for a landman in the East-India company's service. I here fought the French in six pitched battles; and I verily believe, that, if I could read or write, our captain would have made me a corporal; but it was not my good fortune to have any promotion, for I soon fell sick and so got leave to return home again, with forty pounds in my pocket. This was at the beginning
<PB N="23" REF="011340_0060_0F86A09CB642B770"/>
of the present war, and I hoped to be set on shore, and to have the pleasure of spending my money; but the government wanted men, and so I was pressed for a sailor, before ever I could set my foot on shore.</P>
<P>The boatswain found me, as he said, an obsti∣nate fellow; he swore he knew that I understood my business well, but that I <HI>shammed Abraham,</HI> to be idle; but God knows, I knew nothing of the sea-business, and he beat me without consi∣dering what he was about. However I had still my forty pounds, and that was some comfort to me under every beating; and the money I might have had to this day, but that our ship was taken by the French, and so I lost all.</P>
<P>Our crew was carried into Brest, and many of them died, because they were not used to live in a jail; but for my part, it was nothing to me, for I was seasoned. One night as I was sleeping on the bed of boards, with a warm blanket about me, for I always loved to lie well, I was awakened by the boatswain who had a dark lanthorn in his hand; Tom, says he to me will you knock out the French centry's brains? I don't care, says I, striv∣ing to keep myself awake, if I lend a hand. Then follow me, says he, and I hope we shall do busi∣ness. So up I got, and tied my blanket, which was all the cloaths I had, about my middle, and went with him to fight the Frenchmen. I hate the French because they are all slaves, and wear wooden shoes.</P>
<P>Though we had no arms, one Englishman is able to beat five French at any time; so we went down to the door, where both the centries were posted, and rushing upon them, seized their arms in a moment, and knocked them down. From thence nine of us ran together to the quay, and seizing the first boat we met, got out of the har∣bour
<PB N="24" REF="011340_0061_0F86A09DDC8D7E78"/>
and put to sea. We had not been here three days before we were taken up by the Dorset priva∣teer who were glad of so many good hands; and we consented to run our chance. However we had not as much luck as we expected. In three days we fell in with the Pompadour privateer, of forty guns, while we had but twenty-three; so to it we went yard-arm and yard-arm. The fight lasted for three hours, and I verily believe we should have taken the Frenchman, had we but had some more men left behind: but unfortunately, we lost all our men just as we were going to get the victory.</P>
<P>I was once more in the power of the French, and I believe it would have gone hard with me had I been brought back to Brest: but by good fortune, we were retaken by the Viper. I had almost forgot to tell you, that in that engagement, I was wound∣ed in two places: I lost four fingers of the left hand, and my leg was shot off. If I had had the good fortune to have lost my leg and the use of my hand on board a kings ship and not a-board a pri∣vateer, I should have been entitled to cloathing and maintainance during the rest of my life: but that was not my chance: one man is born with a silver spoon in his mouth, and another with a wooden ladle. However, blessed be God, I enjoy good health, and will forever love liberty and Old England. Liberty property and Old England, for ever, huzza!</P></Q>
<P>Thus saying, TOM limped off, leaving me in admiration at his intrepidity and content: but I could not avoid acknowledging, that an habitual acquaintance with misery serves better than philoso∣phy to teach us to despise it.</P>
