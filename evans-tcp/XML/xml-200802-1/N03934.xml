<P>W<HI>Ednesday, June</HI> 25. Went on Monday, and returned this Evening from <HI>Ebenezer,</HI> which I have seen with no small Satisfacti∣on. Surely there is a Difference even in this Life between those that serve the LORD and those that serve him not. All other Places of the Colony seem to be like <HI>Egypt,</HI> where was Dark∣ness; but <HI>Ebenezer,</HI> like the Land of <HI>Goshen,</HI> wherein was great Light. For near four Miles did I walk in almost one continued Field with a most plentiful Crop of Corn, Pease, Potatoes, &amp;c. growing upon it; all the Produce of a few Months Labour—But GOD gives the Labourers a pecu∣liar Blessing: They are unanimous; the Weak help the Strong, and all seem hearty for the common

Good. In a few Years the <HI>Saltzburghers</HI> I believe will be a flourishing People. Their Land is tolle∣rable good, and lies very near the River. They already provide Food, and e're long will be capable of providing Raiment for themselves. I shall send 'em up Cotton, and Spinning-Wheels, and a Loom to begin a Manufactory; and next Year I hope their own Land will produce enough Flax, Cotton &amp;c. to carry it on. I had sweet Communion with their Ministers—Our Sister, or Orphan-House there, is blessed by their Means; and yesterday was set apart as a Day of Thanksgiving, for some Assistances lately sent the dear Lambs from <HI>Ger∣many</HI> and <HI>Savannah</HI>—The People seem very grateful. They willingly received me into their little, but cleanly Huts, and seemed proud when I would accept any Thing from their Hands. Bles∣sed be God, certainly some Blessings are in Store for <HI>Georgia;</HI> as I said formerly, so I say again, they who help the <HI>Saltzburghers</HI> will do a good Work; they want Assistance. <HI>LORD, raise them up Benefactors for thy Mercies sake.</HI></P>

<HI>Monday, June</HI> 30. For these ten Days last past have had frequent Communications from above, both by Way of Humiliation and Exaltation. God has often been pleased since my Return to make himself known in our Sanctuary, and caused a mighty Power to attend the Word preached both in publick and private. I have been much refresh'd with a Packet of Letters from English Friends.—Providence seems to smile upon the Orphan-House and to prosper every Thing that I take in Hand. A wealthy, moral, civilized Planter of <HI>South-Caro∣lina</HI> came lately to see us, and God I believe has been pleased to give him a true Knowledge of him∣self, and a true Faith in his dear SON JESUS CHRIST.—His Wife also was much quickn'd, having been wrought upon by God some time last Winter; she was a great Admirer of Archbishop <HI>Tillotson,</HI> but having her Eyes now opened to dis∣cern spiritual Things, can no longer take up with such Husks, fit only for carnal, unawakened, un∣believing Reasoners to eat. With this happy Pair (hearing both by Letters, and otherwise that <HI>Charles-Town</HI> People were in great Expectation of seeing me before I went to the Northward, and that God had been pleased to Work by my late Ministry among them) I and a dear Friend left <HI>Savannah</HI> this Morning, in a large Boat, built up one another in the Way, arrived at <HI>Beaufort</HI> in <HI>Port-Royal</HI> about Midnight. Our Friend and his Wife went to a Relation's House, but my Compa∣nion and I chose to continue in the Boat, where our Lord was pleased to cause us to lye down and sleep in Peace and Safety. <HI>Blessed, forever blessed

<P><HI>Tuesday, July</HI> 1. Felt a most sweet and hum∣bling Sense of the Divine Presence in my Soul this Morning,—Went as soon as 'twas Light to a Re∣lation's of our Fellow-Travellers, and afterwards had some close Conversation with Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> the Minister of the Parish, about the great Doc∣trines of the Gospel; he received me with much Tenderness and Respect, but thought I went too far in condemning Archbishop <HI>Tillotson.</HI>—I think the Arguments I brought were conclusive, and the Account which my New-Convert (being one of his Parishoners) gave of God's dealing with his Soul was rational, and as he confessed satisfactory.—But he could not see clearly into the Doctrine of free Justification without Regard to any Thing foreseen in the Creature—However being more noble then most of his other Brethren, he was candid and courteous, and notwithstanding he was in Dan∣ger of incurring the Displeasure of the Commissary thereby, yet he read Prayers and requested me to preach in the Evening at his Church, I did, tho' to a small Auditory, there being but little Notice gi∣ven of my Preaching: After Sermon Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> returned me Thanks and having promised to preach again, (God willing) in my Return to <HI>Savannah,</HI> I took my Leave and spent the Evening with my Fellow-Travellers at their Relations House. <HI>May God convert every one related to 'em, and make 'em all Members of the Houshold of Faith!

<P><HI>Thursday, July</HI> 3. Set out Yesterday Morning about One o'Clock, and reach'd Mr. <HI>Bryan'</HI>s Plantation about 10, stay'd and dined comfortably together, wrote a few Letters, rode thro' extream Heat, put in, and lay at a Planter's House, by reason of the Thunder, Lightning, and Rain; breakfasted this Morning at Mr. <HI>Bees</HI> at <HI>Ponpon,</HI> pray'd, talk'd of the Things of God, and was en∣abled to hold out notwithstanding the Weather was exceeding hot, 'till I came to <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> about 80 Miles from <HI>Beaufort.</HI> Here again my Spirits were much raised, and my Heart comforted by a Packet of Letters from the Northward, giving me Account how the <HI>Word of the Lord run, and was glorified</HI> in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and other adjacent Places. <HI>The Lord's Name be praised, from the rising up of the Sun to the going down of the same.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, July</HI> 4. Lay at a Gentlewoman's House, who came last Night to give me the Offer of her House, was invited by many dear Friends of the Town, who were rejoiced to see me. Receiv'd a Letter from the Commissary, which I immediately answered; wrote several Letters to <HI>Savannah;</HI> dispatch'd some Affairs for the Orphan-House, and preach'd in the Evening in the Independents Meet∣ing-House to as large and attentive a Congregation as usual. <HI>Blessed be God for giving the People a hearing Ear; Lord give 'em also an obedient Heart for thy dear Son's sake.</HI> Amen.</P>

Went to Church Morning and Evening, and heard the Commissary preach as <HI>virulent</HI> and <HI>unorthodox, in∣consistent Discourse,</HI> as ever I heard in my Life. His Heart seemed full of Choler and Resentment: Out of the Abundance thereof, he poured forth so many bitter Words against the <HI>Methodists</HI> (as he called them) in general, and <HI>Me</HI> in particular, that several who intended to receive the Sacrament at his Hands, withdrew. Never I believe was such a Preparation-Sermon preach'd before. I could not help thinking the Preacher was of the same Spirit with Bishop <HI>Gardner</HI> in Queen <HI>Mary'</HI>s Days. After Sermon he sent his Clerk to desire me not to come to the Sacrament, till he had spoke with me—I immediately retired to my Lodging, rejoicing that I was accounted worthy to suffer this further Degree of Contempt for my dear Lord's Sake. <HI>Blessed Jesus lay it not to the Commissary's Charge.</HI> Amen and Amen</P>

ended, and much Importunity used, I went with some <HI>Charles-Town</HI> Friends to the House of Mrs. <HI>Peter'</HI>s about 5 Miles from the Meeting-House, but was obliged to lay down (as I now am gene∣rally every Day) by reason of the violent Heat of the Weather, and great Expence of Sweat.—However God strengthened me much at Night, and so assisted me in giving an Exhortation to the Company that came with me; that all seemed to be put under great Concern; and three, or four, in particular came out, telling me how powerfully God was working upon their Souls. <HI>Father, Shew that it is thy especial Work by carrying it on and perfecting it till the Day of our Lord Jesus.</HI></P>

About 4 in the Afternoon we set out again, took a little Refreshment at a Gentleman's House in the Way, and lay at Mr. <HI>Chanler'</HI>s at Night—Here my bodily Strength much failed me again, and therefore being very weak retired to Bed <HI>as soon as</HI> possible, but slept very little. <HI>Lord, hasten that blessed Time when I shall sleep no more.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Wednesday, July</HI> 9. Found myself still weaker than before, but was strengthned to preach under a Tree near Mr. <HI>Chanler'</HI>s Meeting-House about 10 in the Morning. The House being now too small to contain the Congregation, People seemed to come from all Parts, and the Word, (as I was told) came with a convincing Power—Having changed my Linnen, which I am obliged to do after every Sermon by Reason of my prodigious Sweating, I hastened away for <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> but my Body was so exceeding weak and the Sun shone so intensely hot, that five Miles before I reached Town, I call'd in at a publick House, and lay for a considerable Time, almost breathless and dead, but God poured ineffable Comforts into my Soul, and being thereby strengthned in the inner Man, I once more set forward with my dear Fellow-Travellers, reach'd Town about four and preach'd about six at the usual Place, and with much more Freedom and Power, then could any Ways be expected, considering the great Weakness of my Body: <HI>I can do all Things, thro' Christ strengthen∣ing me; I thank thee holy Father Lord of Heaven and Earth, that I have so often the Sentence of Death within myself Oh!

Returned in the Evening to <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> preach'd twice there Yesterday, and went this Morning to <HI>John's-Island,</HI> about 20 Miles up the River, whither I was invited by Colonel <HI>Gibs;</HI> he receiv'd me and my Friends most hospitably, provided several Horses, Chairs, &amp;c. for us, and his Family: We rode very pleasantly to the Church—There was a great Con∣gregation; God strengthned me to read Prayers; and preach'd twice with much Freedom. About four we returned to the Colonel's—I eat with some Appetite—Was enabled to give a warm and close Exhortation to the Rich that sat about me, and re∣turned to <HI>Charles-Town</HI> in the Evening with my dear Friends, praising and blessing God. Glory be to his most holy Name, Dagon seems daily to fall before the Ark. A lasting Impression I am persuad∣ed is made on many Hearts, and God I believe will yet shew that he hath much People in <HI>Charles-Town</HI> and the Countries round about. <HI>Lord thou hast visi∣ted them with thy Judgments, melt them down now with thy Mercies. Stretch out the golden Scepter of thy Favour, and bruise them no more with thy Iron Rods; even so Lord Jesus.</HI> Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, July</HI> 13. Preach'd this Morning with much Power, and collected in the Evening for my poor Orphans; great Numbers stood without the Doors, and it raining very hard in Time of divine Service, many of 'em were driven away; however God caused the other People's Hearts to devise liberal Things. Upwards of 50. <HI>l.</HI> Sterl. were col∣lected on the Occasion; most shewed a great Rea∣diness to assist me, and the Lord was pleased much to enlarge my Heart, to give Praise unto his Name.

In the Morning I went to Church, and heard the Commissary preach. But had some infernal Spirit been sent to draw my Picture, I think it scarcely possible he could paint me in more horrid Colours. I think if ever, then was the Time that all manner of Evil was spoke against me falsly for Christ's sake; The Commissary seem'd to ransack Church-History for Instances of Enthusiasm and abused Grace; he drew a Parallel between me, and all the <HI>Oliverians,</HI> Ranters, Quakers, French Prophets, till he came down to a Family of the <HI>Dutarts</HI> who lived (not many Years ago) in <HI>South-Carolina,</HI> and were guilty of the most notorious Incests, and Murders. To the Honour of God's free Grace be it spoken, whilst he was representing me thus, I felt the blessed Spirit strengthning and refreshing my Soul, God at the same Time gave me to see what I was by Nature, how I had deserved his eternal Wrath, and therefore I did not feel the least Resentment against the Preacher; no, I pitied, I prayed for him, and wish'd from my Soul, that the Lord would convert him, as he did once the Persecutor <HI>Saul,</HI> and let him know, that 'tis Jesus whom he perse∣cutes. In the Evening many came as I was inform'd, to hear what I would say, but as the Commissary hinted that his Sermons shou'd be printed, and as they were full of invidious Falshoods, I held my Tongue, and made little or no Reply. <HI>Father forgive him for he knows not what he does.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, July</HI> 19. Preach'd all this Week twice every Day at <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> except on Wednesday and Thursday Evening, the last of which Days I was call'd upon to appear in Court, on the former,
<PB N="13" REF="004848_0007_100E0198070E7138"/>
was desired to go to <HI>James'</HI>s <HI>Island</HI> to preach at the House of one Madam <HI>Woodward.</HI> This Gentle∣woman, as she inform'd me her self, was once much prejudiced against me, in so much, that she tho't it dangerous to come and hear me—But ha∣ving read my Sermons, she changed her Mind; and coming both to Town and <HI>John'</HI>s <HI>Island</HI> to hear me preach, was with her Daughter, and ano∣ther Gentlewoman much melted down—Being given to Hospitality, she provided Food sufficient for a great Multitude. People came from Town and all the th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther neighbouring Places—Her Barn was put into proper Order, and I read Prayers, and preach'd in it with much of God's blessed Spirit in my Soul—A lovely melting was visible in several Parts of the Auditory. After Sermon, God ena∣bled me to speak many Gospel Truths amidst a polite Set of People, and at the Request of Madam <HI>Woodward</HI> I staid all Night; this gave me an Op∣portunity of teaching her Family the Way of God more perfectly, and also of resting my weary Bo∣dy, which seems to be declining more and more every Day. <HI>Blessed be God, if it be consistent with his Glory, and the Good of Souls, I hope it will not be long e're Worms destroy it, and my Soul carried to see my God.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Tuesday, July</HI> 15. I appeared according to the Citation, at the appointed Hour and Place; there were very many Spectators, and the Rev. Mr. <HI>Garden,</HI> Commissary, the Rev. Mr. <HI>Guy,</HI> the Rev. Mr. <HI>Millichamp,</HI> the Rev. Mr. <HI>Roe,</HI> the Rev. Mr. <HI>Orr,</HI> sat as Judges, they receiv'd me with good Manners, and after the Clerk of the Court had taken a Minute of their appearing, the Commis∣sary tender'd to me a Paper, desiring my Answer to those Articles; but I refus'd taking it, till I was satisfied of the Authority of the Court in Question, adding, Do you think I would incur a a Premunire of doing what I could not answer, or Words to that Effect? He then said they would proceed to censure: Upon which I reminded them of the Example of the Magistrates, who exceeded
<PB N="16" REF="004848_0009_100E019BFAAC14A0"/>
their Authority, in condemning and scourging St. <HI>Paul,</HI> being a Roman, unheard: At this one of the Clergy sneer'd; but the Commissary replied, We shall not go beyond our Power, or scourge you. After a short Debate, the Commissary sent his Ap∣paritor to his House for his Commiss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n in order to give me Satisfaction; in about a quarter of an Hour he returned with several Bundles of Papers, out of which the Commissary first produced his Commission, to act as Commissary, from the Bishop of <HI>London;</HI> I read it, and approv'd of it; but at the same Time desired to be satisfied of the Bishop of <HI>London'</HI>s Authority in this Province, not finding the Royal Authority underwritten, as men∣tioned in his publick Citation: Upon this a Latin Commission without a Seal, was ordered to be read by the Clerk of the Court.—I objected that it was in Latin, contrary to our late Act, ordering every Thing to be in English; and not well under∣standing the Clerk, as he read it, I desired the Perusal of it my self, which was granted. I read it with an audible Voice, and after reading it, I objected, that though there might be a general Power given to the Bishop to exercise ecclesiastical Jurisdiction in this Province, yet the Extent of that Power was to be determined by particular Acts of Assembly. I further urged, that a Court of this Nature was entirely unprecedented in <HI>America,</HI> that I belonged to <HI>Georgia,</HI> a different Province, and was here only as an Itenerate. I also added, that my Lord of <HI>London,</HI> (though I preached in the Fields for some Months) never attempted to exercise such Authority against me. The Commissary replied, Though I
<PB N="17" REF="004848_0009_100E019BFAAC14A0"/>
belonged to <HI>Georgia,</HI> yet I had committed Irregula∣rities here, and therefore came under his Cognizance, and that what he had to lay to my Charge, might be Crimes of a different Nature.</P>
<P>Not satisfied with my Objections, he ordered the Clerk to minute down that I contumaciously con∣temned the Authority of the Court, but I desired that Expression might be softned, declaring from my Heart that what I did, proceeded from a real Scruple con∣cerning their Authority, urging the Example of King <HI>Charles,</HI> who, before he made Answer to his Accusers, insisted on knowing the Authority his Judges had to call him to an Account. I further objected that the Commissary in <HI>Maryland</HI> &amp; <HI>Pensylvania</HI> were mere Cyphers—That the Trustees to my Knowledge questioned the Bishop of <HI>London'</HI>s having any Ju∣risdiction in these Parts, and that the Governour of <HI>Maryland</HI> acting as Ordinary, had summoned his Clergy lately to meet him as such, which accord∣ingly they did: I therefore upon the whole humbly desired as a Favour from the Court, that I might have till To-morrow 9 o'Clock, the Time to which the Court was adjourned, to inform my self of the Extent of their ecclesiastical Jurisdiction in this Province, assuring them that upon finding their Authority valid, I would immediately answer to any Interrogatories, and would be ready to re∣ceive any Sentence they could with Justice pass upon me—Tho' at my first asking, he said, he had in∣dulged me too far already, yet after some Conside∣ration, Mr. Commissary ordered the Clerk to rase out the former Minute, and to record that upon
<PB N="18" REF="004848_0010_100E019F05F6CB60"/>
my scrupling the Authority of the Court, I was in∣dulged my Request.</P>
<P>Our Lord was pleased to fulfil his Promise made to those that should be called before Rulers, and Governours, for his Name Sake; my Soul was full of Peace; I pitied, but did not feel the least Emo∣tion of Resentment against my Judges.—The Peo∣ple behaved pretty quiet, but some broke out into a Laughter, something irregular, when I said the Commissary in <HI>Pensylvania</HI> and <HI>Maryland</HI> were but Cyphers. This I disapproved of, and check'd immediately. After the Court was adjourned, and the Commissary rose from his Seat I made my O∣beisance, and returned to my Lodgings, thinking my self more highly honoured by my Lord this Morning, than in any other Part of my Life.—<HI>Lord strengthen me in all my other impending Trials, for thy great Name's Sake,</HI> Amen and Amen.</P>

Appeared this Morning at the Hour of 10 and exhibited a <HI>Recusatio Judicis,</HI> i. e. my Exception again the Commissary's being my Judge in this Cause, having too great Reason to believe him prejudiced against me.—At first the Commissary refused to read it, insisting to know first, whither I acknowledged the Authority of the Court.—unwarily I answer'd, Yes. But upon the Motion of my Advocate, Mr. <HI>Rutledge,</HI> I recalled my Words, and said I admitted, and submitted to an ecclesiastical Court, legally constituted. One of the Clergy on the Bench, would have insisted on my first Answer;—But I told him, it was mean spirited, and beneath a Court, consisting of those that call themselves Ministers of Jesus Christ, to
<PB N="19" REF="004848_0010_100E019F05F6CB60"/>
catch at an Expression, which I immediately cor∣rected.—Upon this the Bench agreed to alter the Minute agreeable to my last Declaration. The Commissary then took my Paper, read it to him∣self, and said he would not accept of it. I then stood up according to Law, and said, I would go and protest against all further Proceedings as null and void, and immediately left the Court; upon Mr. <HI>Rutledge</HI> his Advice, I return'd and declared that I appeared <HI>Apud Acta</HI> to the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> and then withdrew a second Time.—We had not gone far from the Place of Judicature, but I was called back by the Apparitor and Register, we returned, and at the Commissary's Desire gave in my Excep∣tion to be read, and filed.</P>
<P>By this Time Mr. Commissary had gotten one Mr. <HI>Graham</HI> an Attorney to appear in Behalf of the Court, who insisted on having the Merits of my Exceptions tried in Court, but as according to Law, I had referred them to the Examination of Six Arbitrators, Three nominated by me, and Three by the Commissary; Mr. <HI>Rutledge</HI> in my Behalf protested against all further Proceedings, and against my appearing at the next Court 'till my Reference to Arbitrators was complied with, it being quite improbable to imagine that Mr. Com∣missary, who must be judged, if my Exceptions should be tried by that Court, should allow him∣self prejudiced. This <HI>Recusatio Judicis</HI> I exhibited by the Advice of my Friends, not to quibble with, or evade the Force or Rigour of any Law what∣soever, that I might justly fall under: For when the Articles of Impeachment were read, I found
<PB N="20" REF="004848_0011_100E01A1509BFBD0"/>
myself accused only of omitting to read the Com∣mon Prayer in the Presbyterian Meeting at such Times as I preached there.—<HI>Oh that my Adver∣saries may never have any Thing worse to lay to my Charge.</HI></P>
<P>The Spectators were rather more numerous than Yesterday; they behaved quietly, and were much rejoiced to see my Opposers reduced to such a Di∣lemma.—Well said the Psalmist, <HI>The Wrath of Man shall turn to thy Praise. Great God, the Remainder of it do thou restrain, and for thy own Names sake deliver me from the Hands of un∣reasonable Men, who out of a misguided Zeal, and without a Cause are mine Enemies.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday, July</HI> 17. By Advice of Mr. <HI>Rut∣ledge,</HI> appeared in Court at the Time of their Meeting, to see if my Exceptions were admitted to Arbitration or repelled.—The Court being opened Mr. Commissary ask'd me if I was prepared to answer the Articles objected against me. I re∣plied, I could give no Answer till my Exceptions were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ferred to Arbitrators. Mr. <HI>Rutledge</HI> stood up, and spake some few Words in Vindication of my Objections, proving by a Book of ecclesiastical Law, that my Proceedings were according to the Rules therein prescribed. The Register was or∣dered to read their Reasons for repelling my Ex∣ceptions; Mr. <HI>Graham</HI> endeavoured to enforce, ha∣ving first laboured to prove the Jurisdiction of the Court, and to remove the Apprehensions the Country in general or Dissenters in particular, might entertain concerning the ill Consequences of such a Court's being erected. He held on for a consi∣derable
<PB N="21" REF="004848_0011_100E01A1509BFBD0"/>
Time without Interruption, but Mr. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣ledge</HI> rising up to invalidate what he had said, was stopped: At length, therefore finding my Excepti∣ons repelled, I appealed to his Majesty in the high Court of Chancery, and declared all other Pro∣ceedings in that Court against me to be null and void. This caused many to rejoice, and give Thanks unto God in my Behalf.—And my dear Redeemer to comfort my Heart, by his good Pro∣vidence, at my Return to my Lodgings, sent me several Letters from <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> acquainting me how mightily the Word of God grew and prevai∣led in those Parts.—As also Mr. <HI>Boulton,</HI> who lately kept an Assembly-House and whose Daugh∣ter, not long since was converted at <HI>Georgia</HI> wrote me Word that he had near fifty Negroes now lear∣ning to read of him.—And further, that the Peo∣ple of <HI>Philadelphia</HI> at their own Expence, and Ac∣cord, were building a Place for me against Winter one hundred Feet long, &amp; seventy Feet wide. <HI>Lord do thou fill it with thy Presence, and grant that all that come thither to Worship, may worship thee in Spi∣rit and in Truth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, July</HI> 19. After Evening Meeting, was desired by the Apparitor to come and wait on Mr. Commissary, who was sitting in Court, I went. He desired me to deposite <HI>Ten Pounds</HI> Sterling and to swear, that I would lodge my Appeal within a Twelve-month. My Lawyer not being present my Friends were too sollicitous for my Non-com∣pliance, but being to leave Town on Monday, and finding the Commissary's printed Orders gave him Authority to require it, I took the desired Oath,
<PB N="22" REF="004848_0012_100E01A34B907EB8"/>
promised to leave <HI>Ten Pounds</HI> in a Friend's Hands, but withal moved for a Copy of the Court's Pro∣ceedings, which was readily complied with.—The Court being ended, the Commissary desired to speak with me: I ask'd him to go to my Lodgings. He chose to walk in a Green near the Church: His Spirit was something calmer than usual, but after an Hour's Conversation, we were as far from agreeing as before. He charged me with speaking Blasphemy, for saying that if it was in my Power, I would place him at the Right Hand of GOD. Upon my desiring to know wherein the Blasphemy consisted, he replied,—<HI>Where then will you put</HI> CHRIST? I asked him, why he was guilty of that Fault which he charged me with in accusing the Methodists in general, when he only referred to Things wrote or done by me in particular. He answer'd because we were all of one Mind he supposed.—When I questioned him, why he ridi∣cul'd me for making Grimaces in the Pulpit—when he did not come to hear me,—Why says he, as I passed by one Day, I saw you spreading out your Hands.—I replied, did not <HI>Paul</HI> do so when he began to preach? In short all his Discourse was so inconsistent, and contrary to the Gospel of our Lord, that I was obliged to tell him, that I believed him to be an unconverted Man, an Enemy to God, and of alike Spirit with the Persecutor <HI>Soul.</HI>—At this he smiled, and after we had walked for a long while we parted, and God gave me great Satisfaction, that I had delivered my Soul in my private Conversation with the Commissary.—<HI>O

Father give him also Peace, and Joy in believing, through Jesus Christ the Son of thy Love.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, July</HI> 20.—Preach'd this Morning as usual, and went afterward to Church, to hear the Commissary. His Text was, <HI>Take heed how you hear.</HI> At first I thought we should have a peaceable Sermon, especially since we had convers'd before so amicably, but the Gall soon began to flow from his Tongue, tho' not with so much Bitterness, as the last Sunday.—He endeavoured to apologize for his Proceedings, condemned all that followed me, and gave all Hopes of Heaven, that adhered to him, and the Church. In the Evening (tho' I went off my Bed to do it, and was carried in a Chaise) the Lord Jesus strengthned me to take my last Farewel of the dear People of <HI>Charles-Town.</HI>—My Soul was full of Tenderness for them, and many seemed to sympathize with me. Blessed be God for send∣ing me once more among them, tho' the Heat of the Weather, and Frequency of preaching, has per∣haps given an irrecoverable Stroke to the Health of my Body, yet I rejoice, knowing it has been for the Conviction, and I believe Conversion of many a Soul. Glory be to God on high, the Fields here, as well as elsewhere are now white, ready unto Harvest.—Numbers are seeking after Jesus—And two or three gracious dissenting Ministers, by my Advice, agreed to set up a Weekly-Lecture. I advised the People, since the Gospel was not preach'd in the Church, to go and hear it in the Meeting-Houses.—May the Lord be with both Ministers and People, &amp; cause them to preach, and hear as becomes the Gospel of Christ, What makes the Change more
<PB N="24" REF="004848_0013_100E01A516186328"/>
remarkable in <HI>Charles-Town</HI> People, is, that they seemed to me at my first coming to be a People wholly devoted to Pleasure.—One well acquainted with their Circumstances, and Manners, told me more had been annually spent on polite Entertain∣ments, than the Poor's Rate came to, but now the Jewellers and Dancing-Masters begin to cry out that their Craft is in Danger.—A vast Alteration is discernable in the Ladies Dress.—And some, whilst I have been speaking, have been so convinced of the Sin of wearing Jewels, that I have seen them with Blushes, put their Hands to their Ears, and cover them with their Fans.—But I hope the Re∣formation has went farther then Externals. Many moral good sort of Men, who before were setled upon their Lees, have been gloriously awakened to seek after Jesus Christ, and many a <HI>Lydia'</HI>s Heart hath the Lord opened to receive the Things that were spoken.</P>
<P>Indeed the Word came often like a Hammer and a Fire,—And a Door, I believe, will be open∣ed for teaching the poor Negroes.—Several of them have done their usual Work in a less Time, that they might come to hear me.—Many of their Owners who have been awakened, resolve to teach them Christianity. Had I Time, and proper School-masters, I might immediately erect a Negro School in <HI>South-Carolina</HI> as well as <HI>Pensylvania;</HI> many would willingly contribute both Money and Land. Every Day almost something or other was sent for my Orphans at <HI>Georgia.</HI> The People were very solicitous about my Health when they saw me weak, sent me many small Presents, and took
<PB N="25" REF="004848_0013_100E01A516186328"/>
Care to see the Lawyer who pleaded for me: I feared sometimes they would be too hot, but I en∣deavoured to stop their Resentments against the Com∣missary as much as possible, and recommended Peace and Moderation to them in most of my Discourses. <HI>May the Lord Jesus reward them for all their Works of Faith and Labours which have proceeded of Love. May he never leave 'em without a teach∣ing Priest; and may he grant that the Seed sown in their Hearts may grow up into an eternal Har∣vest.</HI> Amen and Amen.</P>

<P><HI>Monday, July</HI> 22. Left <HI>Charles-Town</HI> very ear∣ly, accompanied by many of the Inhabitants, who I hope will prove true Followers of the Lamb.—Read Prayers, and preached at <HI>Ashley-Ferry,</HI> to a large Congregation, and great Power was among 'em. The Weather continuing extream hot, sweating and preaching weakened me very much; I went in a Chariot to Madam <HI>Bellinger'</HI>s, who kindly invited me and my Friends to Dinner, I eat but little, took leave of my dear Fellow-Tra∣vellers as well as I could, took Horse in the Even∣ing, put in for Shelter from the Rain at Major <HI>Smith'</HI>s—and reach'd Mr. <HI>Bees</HI> of <HI>Pon-Pon,</HI> near forty Miles from Town about Midnight. Here I had the Pleasure of meeting Mr. <HI>Hugh Bryan,</HI> but Nature being quite worn out, I went to Rest as soon as possible, not doubting but the Lord would cause me to renew my Strength before the Morning: <HI>Why should I doubt it since the Lord hath said I will never leave or forsake thee?</HI></P>

<HI>Tuesday, July</HI> 23. Slept pretty well, but found myself not strong enough to engage in Family Duty, met with and was civilly treated by Mr. <HI>Stobo,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Steward,</HI> two Scotch Presbyterian Ministers, and Mr. <HI>Thompson,</HI> a Church of <HI>England</HI> Missionary, who refused to preach, or sit in Judg∣ment against me. About Noon God strengthned me to ride a Mile, and preach under a great Tree, to an attentive Auditory; some I observed were affected, and I would have willingly preached a se∣cond Time, but my Body was so Weak, that by the Advice of Friends I resolved to continue where I was all Night.—<HI>Surely it cannot be long e're this earthly Tabernacle will be dissolved. Never did the Heart pant more eagerly after the Water-Brooks, than my Soul thirsts after the Enjoyment of thee my God.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Wednesday, July</HI> 24. Rose sometime before Day, and got to <HI>Hoospanah-Chappel,</HI> near thirty Miles from Mr. <HI>Bees,</HI> about Noon, here I preach'd to a very small Auditory, few People living thereabout a, (but as I was afterwards inform'd) not without some good Effect.—Sermon being over I went on Horseback to <HI>Good-Hope,</HI> where Mr. <HI>Hugh Bryan</HI> lived, and several followed, hoping I would preach again in the Evening, but here my bodily Strength so failed me, and God poured such ineffable Thirst∣ings and Hungerings into my Soul after him, that I sometimes hoped he was about to set my imprison'd Soul at Liberty. <HI>Surely my God then placed me upon</HI> Mount Pisgah, <HI>and gave me a distant Prospect</HI>

Their Master had acquainted them, I believe, that I was their Friend, he himself sat by, and wept too, but alas! God soon shewed me that the Time of my Departure was not yet at Hand. In a short Time, I perceived my Body grew stronger, and I was enabled to walk about as well as I could, I joined in Family-Prayer, I begged of God, if I was not to die, but live, it might be to declare the Works and Loving-kindness of the Lord—<HI>Grant this O Father, for thy dear Son's sake.</HI> Amen, and Amen.</P>

<P><HI>Friday, July</HI> 26. Took Boat before Day, and having fine Weather and a favourable Gale, reach'd <HI>Savannah,</HI> and saluted my dear Family about five in the Evening.—My Body being Weak it could not bear up under the Joy and Satisfaction which I felt in my Mind, however I kneeled down, wept out a short Prayer, and Thanksgiving, and as well as I could, told my Assistants what God had done for my Soul.—In the Evening I expounded, and undesignedly thinking it was the Lesson for the Night, read the last Chapter of St. <HI>Paul'</HI>s second Epistle to <HI>Timothy.</HI>—In which were these incou∣raging Words.—<Q>But watch thou in all Things endure Afflictions, do the Work of an Evangeli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> make full Proof of thy Ministry. <HI>Alexander</HI> the Coppersmith, did me much Evil; the Lord re∣ward him according to his Works, of whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thou aware also, for he hath greatly withstood our Words.

<P><HI>Thursday, August</HI> 7. Continued very Weak ever since my return from <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> but was much refreshed this Morning with the Sight of some dear Friends (amongst whom was one Mr. <HI>Tilly</HI> a gra∣cious Baptist Minister) who came in our Sloop to see the Orphan-House.—I gave them the Meeting at early Prayers, and God enabled me to expound with Power. <HI>Lord, let them not depart hence with∣out having some spiritual Gift imparted to them.</HI> Amen, and Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, August</HI> 3. Felt more than common of the divine Presence in my Soul since the Arrival of <HI>Charles-Town</HI> Friends, who brought the Orphans many Presents, and blessed be God, for the Foot∣steps of his Goodness and Providence plainly dis∣cernable amongst us.—But last Night thro' Weak∣ness of Body, and a prodigious Concern, which lay upon my Soul, on Account of some domestick Trials, just as I began Family-Prayer, I was struck as I thought almost for Death, I put up a few bro∣ken Accents, and breathed out, <HI>Lord, Jesus receive my Spirit.</HI> This Morning my Master shewed me why I was thus humbled: Soon after I lose I found that Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> and his Wife of <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> Mr. <HI>Jonathan Bryan,</HI> Brother to Mr. <HI>Hugh Bryan,</HI> and one Mr. <HI>Bull,</HI> were come to pay us a Visit.—Tho' exceeding Weak, and I had almost laid aside Thoughts of officiating this Day, yet upon Mr. <HI>Jones'</HI>s intimating that Friends came expecting to hear me, I promised if I could to preach, and beg'd him to read Prayers; he did, but I found myself
<PB N="30" REF="004848_0016_100E01AC30CC5328"/>
so ill that I would fain have perswaded Mr. <HI>Tilly</HI> to preach for me; he peremptorily refused, urg∣ing that God wou'd strengthen me if I begun.—Upon this I stood up, and soon found Power com∣municated to me from above; I felt a sweet mel∣ting in my Soul, and e're I had prayed long Mr. <HI>Bull</HI> dropped down as tho' shot with a Gun; he soon got up and sat attentively to hear the Sermon, the Power soon spread abroad, the greatest Part of the Congregation was under Concern;—Tears trickled down apace. God manifested himself also much amongst us during the Time of the Sacra∣ment: And I went home ashamed that I was so unwilling to preach;—I stood justly reproved, when Mr. <HI>Tilly</HI> after he came home, said, did I not tell you, God would strengthen you? <HI>Dearest Lord, for thy Mercies sake, never let me distrust thee again! Oh, me of little Faith!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday August</HI> 4. Was sent for about Noon to see Mr. <HI>Janathan Bryan.</HI> At my coming, I found him under great Concern and strong Con∣victions of Sin.—Oh how did he reflect on his past mispent Life, how did he bless God for bring∣ing him to <HI>Savannah,</HI> how did he desire that he might be found in Christ e're he returned home! His Wife fat weeping by, and Mr. <HI>Bull</HI> lay on a Bed groaning in Bitterness of Soul, under a Sense of Guilt, and crying out for an Interest in Christ. I asked him what caused him to fall down Yester∣day? He answer'd, <HI>The Power of GOD's Word!</HI> After about half an Hour's Conversation on the Nature of the New-Birth, and the Necessity of a saving Closure with the Lord Christ, I kneel∣ed
<PB N="31" REF="004848_0016_100E01AC30CC5328"/>
down and prayed with them, and then took my Leave, hoping that the Lord would pluck 'em as Firebrands out of the Fire. <HI>Even so Lord Jesus.</HI> Amen and Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, August</HI> 9. Went on Tuesday with Mr. <HI>Bryan, Jones,</HI> &amp;c. to <HI>Bethesda,</HI> and had the Pleasure of seeing the Work of God much car∣ried on in most of our Visiters Hearts. It was but seldom I could Officiate, but when I did, the Lord generally caused the Word to come with very great Power. This Morning I expounded early, as usual, and read Part of the Prayers at 10 o'Clock, but got Mr. <HI>Tilly</HI> to preach, who tho' a Baptist Minister, joined with us in receiving the Sacrament in the Church of <HI>England</HI> Way; and the King was pleased to sit at his Table; he bro't us into his Banqueting-House, and caused it to be a Feast of fat Things to our Souls. Many I believe fed on Jesus in their Hearts with Thanksgiving. After the Ordinance was over, the Lord enlarged my Heart, and I prayed as the Spirit gave me Ut∣terance. I went home much refreshed in Soul, but so weak in Body, that I declined going to publick Worship in the Afternoon. In the mean while, God gave me a fresh Supply of Strength; about the Evening when my Friends were sitting down to∣gether, finding the Power of the Lord come upon me, I began to speak to them of the Things of God. A great Alteration was soon discernable in most of the Company, their Concern gradually increased, 'till many burst into Floods of Tears, and one fell on the Ground. E'er I had done, some of my Parishioners came up, and the rest of my Family,
<PB N="32" REF="004848_0017_100E01AE08B969E8"/>
they also felt the divine Power. When I had done speaking to them from God, I spoke for them in Prayer to God, my Soul was carried as it were out of the Body, and I was enabled mightily to wrestle with our Lord in their Behalf. He did not let us go without a Blessing. The Room was filled with the Cries of those around me, and many I believe at that Time sought Jesus sorrowing. The Concern continued after the Duty was over. Several, were in great Agonies of Soul, and a <HI>Che∣roke</HI> Indian Trader, who providentially was present desired to speak with me, saying he never saw the like before. Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> also of <HI>Port-Royal</HI> who went away on Friday but was forced back and of∣ficiated for me the Afternoon at <HI>Savannah</HI> told a Friend, that surely God was with us. <HI>Blessed be his rich sovereign and distinguishing Grace; Lord make me lowly in my own Eyes, and cause me still to go on from conquering to conquer. Not unto me, not unto me, but unto thee my King and my God be all the Glory.</HI></P>

The 11th of <HI>Hebrews</HI> also was blessed to me, I found the Benefit of being afflicted.—God enabled me to sanctify him in my Heart, and my greatest Grief was, that I should be so naughty as to oblige my heavenly Father to chastise and scourge me.—<HI>Lord, I adore thy infinite condescending Goodness; Oh! do not leave me to my self, but purge.

Preach'd Yesterday Morn∣ing, and took leave of my Parishioners,—admi∣nistred the blessed Sacrament, and gave a close Exhortation afterwards; settled every Thing to Day to the best of my Power for the Orphan-House, (which succeeds even beyond Expectation) and was so filled with the Love of Christ in this Evening's Exposition, and my private Farewel-Discourse to my Family, that I could almost say I was within the Vail. My Hearers both in publick and private, were vastly affected, and a strange Woman was so touch'd, that she came to me confessing her Sins and crying out, What shall I do to be saved? When I came to converse with her, I found God had struck her the last time I preach'd at <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> and I hope he will now call her effectually by his Grace.—Pleased, and I hope in some measure thankful to the Lord of all Lords, for setting such Seals to my Ministry.

<P><HI>Fryday, August</HI> 21. Had a comfortable Passage with my dear Friends, found the Sea Air improved my Health, and arrived safe at <HI>Charles-Town</HI> about 4 this Afternoon. Many came to the Wharf, and saluted me most kindly; I retired as soon as possible to my old Lodgings, and spent the Evening most sweetly at the House of Mr. <HI>Fowler,</HI> where I hope many true Disciples of the blessed Jesus were met together.—<HI>The Lord who once came to the Eleven by Night, and said Peace be unto you, I am perswaded by his Spirit, spoke to many of them, the Lord I believe has made a willing People in this Day of his Power, praised be his Name from the rising up of the Sun, unto the going down of the same.</HI> Amen and Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Monday, Sept.</HI> I. Being but weak in Body, (except on Sundays) I have preached only once e∣very Day.—But I think with greater Power than ever, and with greater Success: I scarce know the Time wherein I did not see a considerable melting in some Part or other of the Congregation, and often it spread over the whole. Several Times I was so weak before I begun to preach, that I tho't it almost impossible I should go thro' half a Discourse,
<PB N="35" REF="004848_0018_100E01B07708BEC0"/>
but the Lord quickned, enlightned &amp; comforted me above Measure.—Out of Weakness I became strong, and the Lord manifested himself in the Sanctuary.—The Audiences were more numerous than ever, and it was supposed not less than 4000 were in, and about the Meeting-House when I preached my Farewell-Sermon.—The Commissary, having run his utmost length, thought it best to say no more himself.—But he employed one Mr.<HI>Rowe</HI> to preach for him, who told the People, that because of their Wicked∣ness, God had sent them strong Delusions that they might believe a Lie. Finding when I was here last that Jesus Christ was not preached in the Church, my Conscience, would not suffer me to attend on those that preached there any more. I therefore went to the Baptist and Independent Meeting-House, where Jesus Christ I hope was preached in Sincerity.—I likewise administred the Sacrament thrice in a private House, <HI>viz.</HI> Yesterday was sev'n-night, Yesterday and this Morning,—Never did I see any Thing more solemn, the Room was large and most were dissolved into Tears as tho' they were weeping at their Saviour's Cross. Surely Jesus Christ was evidently set forth before them; many, at their Requests stood by, that did not re∣ceive, but they wept bitterly; I prayed for them, and all with great Power, and I hope the Lord will cloath 'em with a Wedding-Garment: What was best, Baptists, Church-Folks, and Presbyterians all joined together, and received according to the Church of <HI>England</HI> except two, who desired to have it sitting, I willingly complied, knowing it was a Thing quite indifferent.—Many others hear∣ing

how God was amongst us Yesterday, desired I would administer to them to Day.—I did, and our Lord was with us again. Having more Leisure from my private Studies, by Reason my Weakness would not permit me to read much▪ I had better Opportunities of conversing with and confirming those that were under Convictions, most of 'em I found grown in Grace and their Hearts softned by redeeming Love. Mr. <HI>Jonathan Bryan</HI> and Mr.<HI>Bull</HI> came to <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> I hope more established.—Mr. <HI>Hugh Bryan,</HI> they left sick at Home, drinking deeply of the Cup of God's Con∣solations.—His Wife came with them to <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> a gracious Woman. By my Advice they re∣turned Home with a Resolution to begin a Negro-School for their Slaves.—A young Stage-Player convinced, when I was last at <HI>New-York,</HI> and who providentially came to <HI>Georgia</HI> when M<HI>Jonathan Bryan</HI> was there, is to be their first Master, the Time would fail me, was I to descend to every Particular. Great, very great Alteration is made in the Life, and Manners of most of the polite Ladies; the Rooms that were usually employed for Balls and Assemblies were now turned into So∣ciety-Rooms.—Every Night where I was invited to Supper, it became customary to have the House filled with Company, whom the Lord enabled me to pray with and exhort with great Power, but once I was so weak, that I was obliged to be led home: Many came to me in private under the deepest Convictions.—Several were esteemed mad by their Relations. One young Lady in particular for some little Time was turned out of Doors, but
<PB N="37" REF="004848_0019_100E01B282DE0A10"/>
afterwards was recalled again. And one Trades∣man who was look'd upon as a very good Man, was convicted of his self Righteousness in an extra∣ordinary Manner, and burnt near <HI>Forty Pounds</HI> worth of Books written by such as <HI>Chub, Foster,</HI> &amp;c;. The care which People expressed of my Health and Preservation was uncommon, they were gene∣rally sending me in something or other; and so loaded our Sloop with Sea-stores, that I was obli∣ged to send part of them to the Orphan-House. How this Work will end, I know not, at present there's a comfortable Prospect that the Lord will gather to himself out of <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> a peculiar People zealous of good Works. Being to be absent from them for a long Season. I exhorted 'em with all my Power to continue in their Grace of God, I forewarned them of their Danger, and told them how they must deny themselves and take up their daily Crosses, if they wou'd follow Jesus Christ. Having our Sloop freighted, and the Wind favouring us, after Dinner, with several <HI>Charles-Town</HI> Friends I embark'd for <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> inten∣ding to go by Land from thence to <HI>Boston;</HI> in the Evening we got over the Bar, but the Pilot would not take any Thing for his Trouble. Here I par∣ted with all Friends, except four, two of which (God willing) intend to accompany me during this Ex∣cussion. <HI>Do thou O Lord who claspest the Winds in thy Fists, and holdest the Waters in the hallow of thine Hand, accept our Thanks, for past Mercies.</HI>—<HI>Sanctify our Voyage, and if it be best carry us with speed to the Haven where we would be.</HI> Amen and Amen.</P>

<HEAD>Newport in Rhode-Island.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Sunday, Sept.</HI> 14. Was sick Part of the Passage, but found afterwards the Sea-Air, under God, much improv'd my Health, arrived at <HI>Newport</HI> in <HI>Rhode Island,</HI> just after the Beginning of Evening Service; we came purposely thither first with our Sloop: I think it the most pleasant Entrance I ever yet saw, almost all the Morning the Wind was contrary; but I found a very strong Inclination to pray, that we might arrive time enough to be present at publick Worship. Once I called the People, but something prevented their coming, at last finding my Impression increase upon me, I desired their Attendance immediately: They came with a strong Assurance we should be heard. We pray'd the Lord, that he might turn the Wind that we might give him Thanks in the great Con∣gregation, and also that he would send such to us as he would have us to converse with, and who might shew us a Lodging.—Tho' the Wind was a Head, when we begun, yet when we had done praying and came up out of the Cabbin it was quite fair; with a gentle Gale we sailed most pleasantly into the Harbour, got into publick Worship before they had finished the Psalms, and sat as I thought undiscovered.—After Service was over, a Gentle∣man asked me whither my Name was not <HI>Whitefield,</HI> I told him yes; he then desired me to go to his House, and he would take Care to provide Lodgings and Necessaries for me, and my Friends. I went,
<PB N="39" REF="004848_0020_100E01B4EE337FD8"/>
silently admiring God's Goodness in answering my Prayers, so minutely. Several Gentlemen of the Town soon came to pay their Respects to me, among whom, was one Mr. <HI>Clap,</HI> an aged dissent∣ing Minister, but the most venerable Man I ever saw in my Life, he looked like a good old Puritan, and gave me an Idea of what Stamp those Men were who first settled <HI>New-England.</HI> His Coun∣tenance was very heavenly,—he rejoiced much in Spirit at the Sight of me, and prayed most af∣fectionately for a Blessing on my coming to <HI>Rhode-Island.</HI> In the Evening with him, and some more Friends, I waited on Mr. <HI>Honeyman,</HI> the Minister of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> and desired the Use of his Pulpit, at first he seemed a little unwilling, being desirous to know what extraordinary Call I had to preach on Week-Days, which he said was disorderly; I answered, St. <HI>Paul</HI> exhorted <HI>Timothy</HI> to be <HI>instant in Season, and out of Season;</HI> that if the Orders of the Church were rightly complied with, our Ministers should read publick Prayers twice every Day, and then it would not be dis∣orderly, at such Times, to give the People a Ser∣mon: As to an extraordinary Call, I told him I claimed none but that Injunction of the Apostle; <HI>As we have Opportunity, let us do Good unto all Men.</HI> He still held out, and did not give any positive Answer, but at last, after he had withdrawn, and consulted with the Gentlemen, he said if my preach∣ing would promote the Glory of God, and the good of Souls, I was welcome to his Church as of∣ten as I would, during my Stay in Town; we then agreed to make use of it, at Ten in the Morning,
<PB N="40" REF="004848_0021_100E01B7423DB718"/>
and Three in the Afternoon. After this I went and waited on the Governour, who seemed to be a very plain Man, and had a very plain House, which much pleased me: By Profession, I think he is a seventh Day Baptist; he is a Man of good Re∣port as to his Conduct and dealing with the World. After a short Visit, I returned to take my Leave of Mr. <HI>Honeyman,</HI> and to fetch my Friends who were at his House, waiting for me. We then went to the House of Mr. <HI>Bowers,</HI> who first spake to me, when coming out of Church; the House was soon filled with Company: I expounded and prayed with them for about an Hour, and then re∣tired to a Lodging, the Lord in his good Providence had provided for me; the blessed Jesus was pleased sweetly to manifest himself to my Soul: A Consi∣deration of his distinguishing repeated Mercies quite melted me down, and I called upon all that was within me to praise his holy Name. <HI>O Lord, in the Night Season, let me arise and give Thanks unto thee, and let my Talking be of thy Loving-kindness and tender Mercies all the Day long.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, Sept.</HI> 15. Breakfasted this Morning with old Mr. <HI>Clap,</HI> and was much edified by his Conversation: I could not but think, whilst at his Table, that I was sitting with one of the Pa∣triarchs. He is full of Days, a Batchelor, and has been a Minister of a Congregation in <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> upwards of Forty Years. People of all Denominations I find respect him, he abounds in good Works, gives all away, and is wonderfully tender of little Children. Many of them of different Persuasions come to be instructed by him.
<PB N="41" REF="004848_0021_100E01B7423DB718"/>
Whenever he dies, I am persuaded with good old <HI>Simeon,</HI> he will be enabled to say, <HI>Lord, now lettest thou thy Servant depart in Peace.</HI> At ten in the Morning, and three in the Afternoon, according to Appointment, I read Prayers, and preach'd in the Church: Tis very commodious, and I believe will contain 3000 People; it was more then filled in the Afternoon; Persons of all Denominations attended; God assisted me much; I observed Numbers affected, and had great Reason to believe the Word of the Lord had been sharper then a two-edged Sword in some of the Hearers Souls: After Evening-Service, I received the following Letter,</P>

<SALUTE>Reverend Sir and beloved Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALtho' mine Eyes never saw your Face before this Day, yet my Heart and Soul have been united to you in Love by the Bond of the Spirit. I have longed, and expected to see you for many Months past: Blessed be God, mine Eyes have seen the joyful Day. I trust thro' Grace, I have some Things to communi∣cate to you, that will make your Heart glad: I shall omit writing any thing, and only hereby present my hearty Love, and let you know that I am waiting now at the Post of your Door for Admission; tho' I am unworthy, my Lord is Worthy, in whose Name I trust I come. I am your unworthy Brother,</P>

On Reading it, I could not but think, this was one of those young Ministers whom God had late∣ly made use of in such a remarkable Manner at the East-End of <HI>Long-Island.</HI> I sent for him, and found he was the Man. My Heart rejoiced. We walked out, and took sweet Counsel together, and amongst other Things, he told me that he came to <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> under a full Conviction, that he should see me there, and had been waiting for me eight Days; for he said these Words were migh∣tily impressed upon his Heart, <HI>Is not</HI> Aaron <HI>the</HI> Levite <HI>thy Brother? I know that he can speak well; and also behold he cometh forth to meet thee, and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his Heart; and I will be with thy Mouth, and with his Mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.</HI> What render'd this more remarkable was, I had no intention of sailing into <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> 'till about three Days be∣fore I left <HI>Carolina;</HI> and also, I had a great Desire to put in, if I could, at the East-End of <HI>Long-Island,</HI> to see this very Person, whom the great God now brought unto me. <HI>Lord accept our Thanks, sanctify our Meeting, and teach us both what we shall do for thy own Name Sake.</HI></P>
<P>After a long Conference, we took leave of each other for the Present, but agreed that we should now be Companions in Travel, 'till the Lord shou'd make our Way more plain. In the Even∣ing I went to venerable Mr. <HI>Clap'</HI>s and exhorted, and prayed with a great Multitude who not only crowded into the House but thronged every Way about it; the dear old Man rejoiced to see those Things which he saw; and after my Exhortation
<PB N="43" REF="004848_0022_100E01B9D86F6AB8"/>
was over, dismissed me with his Blessing. <HI>Lord Jesus, do thou say Amen to it, even so Lord Jesus.</HI> Amen and Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, Sept.</HI> 16. Perceived my self a little low in the Morning, but was enabled to read Prayers, and preach with much Flame, Clearness and Power, to still greater Auditories than Yesterday; it being Assembly Time, the Gentlemen adjourned, in or∣der to attend the Service; and several Invitations were given me to come to other adjacent Places. The People were exceedingly attentive, Tears trickled down their Cheeks and so far prevailed with me by their Importunity, that by the divine Permission, I promised to call on them in my Re∣turn from <HI>Boston.</HI> When I came home to my Lodgings, the Woman of the House saluted me with <HI>Blessed art thou of the Lord.</HI> I looked round to see the Reason of such a Salutation, and on the Couch there lay a young Woman; after a little Conversation, I found she had had a gracious Dis∣covery of the Lord Jesus made to her Soul when I was speaking these Words, <HI>Come see a Man that told me all Things that ever I did.</HI> She said, she had often grieved the Spirit of God, but now she believed the Lord was calling her home effectually. The Word, added she, came with such Power, that I was obliged to go out of the Church, other∣wise I must have disturbed the Congregation. When I came from Home contrary to my Mo∣ther's Inclinations, I insisted, I knew not why, on staying at <HI>Newport</HI> six Weeks. She would have me stay only a Month, but at last consented for me to stay my own Time. To-morrow, says she,
<PB N="44" REF="004848_0023_100E01BB94B85240"/>
is the last Day of the six Weeks, and Oh the Good∣ness of God in sending you just now, before my Time was out; or Words to that Effect. After∣wards one or two more came under deep Convicti∣ons, crying out, in the Bitterness of their Souls, after the Lord Jesus.—I prayed with each of them, and exhorted 'em not to rest till they found rest in Jesus Christ: In the Evening I went, as I thought privately to a Friends House, but the People were so eager after the Word that in a short Time I believe more then 1000 were before the Door besides those that were within, and filled every Room in the House, I therefore stood upon the Threshold and spoke for near an Hour on these Words, <HI>Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after Righte∣ousness for they shall be filled.</HI> Blessed be God it was a very solemn Meeting. Being Night, I could not see how the Hearers were affected, but the Lord assisted me in speaking. Glory be to his great Name. Before I retired to Bed, I went, and took my Leave of Mr. <HI>Honeyman,</HI> &amp; had some close Talk with him about the New-Birth. The Lord give him an experimental Knowledge of it; he was very Civil, and would have had me staid with him longer, but being to go on a Journey, on the Mor∣row, after we had conversed about half an Hour, I took my Leave. At my Return to my Lodg∣ings, good old Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> went with me into a Room, and gave me something for my Orphans, and spoke many affectionate Things to me. Altho' very old yet he followed me from one End of the Town to the other, so that People said I had made Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> young again. Oh what a <HI>Crown of Glory is
<PB N="45" REF="004848_0023_100E01BB94B85240"/>
the hoary Head when found in the Way of Righteous∣ness.</HI> He was exceeding desirous of my coming to <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> again, which I promised to do by the divine Permission. For <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> seems to be a Place where much Good may be done. They are a very plain People for the Generality; tho' I observed there were some foolish Virgins at Church, covered over with the Pride of Life; I find they are sadly divided amongst themselves, as to outward Things. I think there are no less than four different Congregations of Baptists; two of the Independ∣ants, and one of the Quakers Persuasion. Dean <HI>Berkly'</HI>s Name is had in much Respect. Amongst them, the established Church is in good Order as to Externals: But many of the Head Members, I found soon were exceeding great Bigots; they seem∣ed very fearful least I should preach in Mr. <HI>Clap'</HI>s Meeting-House, and gloried much in my bringing the good old Man to Church: Nor is there less Bigotry, as far as I could find among those of other Communions, all I fear Place the Kingdom of God too much in Meats and Drinks, and have an ill Name abroad for running of Goods. One Day when I said in my Sermon, <Q>What will become of you, who cheat the King of his Taxes</Q>? The whole Congregation seemed surprized, and look'd on one another as tho' they should say we are guilty. <HI>Lord Jesus give them to know thee, and the Power of thy Resurrection, and teach them to render to Caesar the Things that are Caesar's and to God the Things that are God's.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Newport and Bristol.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Wednesday, Sept.</HI> 17. Left <HI>Newport</HI> in <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> about 9 in the Morning, and reach'd <HI>Bristol,</HI> a Town twelve Miles off about Noon; several Friends from <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> accompanied me, and before we came to the Town, a dissenting Minister, as I found afterwards,—met me, and in the Name of the Court which was then sitting at <HI>Bristol,</HI> invited me and my Friends to dine with them, and also to give them a Sermon. I complied. The Gentlemen received us with much Civility, and after Dinner, I preached in the Meeting-House to more People, than might be expected on such sud∣den Notice. My Heart was much shut up in the Excercise; I felt and saw but little Power, how∣ever the Gentlemen seem'd very thankful. I took my Leave about 4 in the Afternoon, and lay at an Inn about ten Miles farther on the Road. Here the Lord gave me a Spirit of Prayer, I wrestled with God in Behalf of my Self and Friends, supp'd comfortably, sung a Hymn and went to Rest.—<HI>Thanks be to God for his unspeakable Mercies.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday, Sept.</HI> 18. Rose a great while before Day, and set out as soon as it was Light, break∣fasted at a Minister's House on the Road, found the People were apprised of my coming, and were solicitous for my Preaching. But being resolved under God if possible to reach <HI>Boston</HI> that Night, we travel'd on for near fifty Miles, and came to <HI>Boston</HI> about 8 in the Evening; when we were within four Miles of the Town, the Governour's Son, and several other Gentlemen, and one or two
<PB N="47" REF="004848_0024_100E01BDE5B8F798"/>
Ministers, waited at a Gentleman's House to give me the Meeting. They received me with great Gladness and told me many more would have come, had not a large Funeral been in the Town, or if there had been more certain Notice of my arriving. This rejoiced me, for I think I can stand any thing better then this. It favours too much of hu∣mane Grandure. But I must be tryed every Way. The Lord be my Helper. After stopping a little while, we went altogether in Company to <HI>Boston</HI> to the House of one Mr. <HI>Staniford,</HI> Brother in Law to Dr. <HI>Colman,</HI> who long since had sent me an Invitation. Several Ministers and other Gentlemen came in to pay their Respects. My Heart was but low, and my Body weak, but at the Request of one of the Ministers I gave Thanks to our gracious God for bringing me in Safety, and prayed that my coming might be in the Fulness of the Blessing of the Gos∣pel of Peace. We then parted, I eat a little Sup∣per and then retired, beseeching the Lord to raise my Heart and make his Power known in the Hearts of his People. <HI>Even so Lord Jesus,</HI> Amen and Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Friday, Sept.</HI> 19. Slept pretty well, and in the Morning perceived fresh Emanations of Divine Light break in upon, and refresh my Soul. Was visited by several Gentlemen, and Ministers, and went to the Governour's with <HI>Josiah Willard,</HI> <ABBR>Esq;</ABBR> Secretary of the Province, a Man fearing God, and with whom, (tho' before unknown in Person) I have corresponded for some Time. The Governour received me, with the utmost Re∣spect, he seemed to favour the Things which were
<PB N="48" REF="004848_0025_100DEEEEB11A05C8"/>
of God, and desired me to come and see him as often as I could. At 11 o'Clock I went to pub∣lick Worship at the <HI>Church of England,</HI> and after∣wards waited on the Commissary Home who read Prayers. He received me very courteously, and it being a Day, whereon the Clergy of the Establish∣ed Church met, I had the Opportunity of convers∣ing with Five of 'em together. I think one of them first began with me for calling that <HI>Tennent</HI> and his Brethren faithful Ministers of Jesus Christ? I answered, I believed they were. They then ques∣tioned me about the Validity of Presbyterian Ordination? I replied, I believed it was valid. They then urged against me a Passage in my first Journal where I said, <Q>That a Baptist Minister at <HI>Deal,</HI> did not give me a satis∣factory Answer, concerning his Mission.</Q> I answered, Perhaps my Sentiments were altered. And is Mr. <HI>Wesley</HI> altered in his Sentiments too said one, for he was very strenuous for the Church, and against all other Forms of Government when he was at <HI>Boston.</HI> I answered, he was then a great Bigot, but God had since enlarged his Heart, and I believed he was like minded with me, as to this Particular. I then urged, that a Catholick Spirit was best, and that a Baptist Minister had commu∣nicated with me lately at <HI>Savannah:</HI> And I sup∣pose, says another Clergyman, you wou'd do him as good a Turn, and communicate with him. I answered, yes. I then urged, that it was best, to preach up the New-Birth, and the Power of God∣liness, and not to insist so much on the Form, for People would never be brought to one Mind, as to
<PB N="49" REF="004848_0025_100DEEEEB11A05C8"/>
that, nor did Jesus Christ ever intend it. Yes, but says Dr. <HI>Cutler,</HI> he did. How do you prove it? <HI>Why,</HI> says he, <HI>our Lord prayed, that all might be one even as thou Father, and I are one.</HI> I reply∣ed, that was spoken of the inward Union of the Souls of Believers with Jesus Christ, and not of the outward Church. <HI>That cannot be,</HI> (says Dr. <HI>Cutler</HI>) <HI>for how then could it be said, That the World might know, that thou hast sent me?</HI> He then taking it for granted, that the Church of <HI>England</HI> was the only true apostolical Church, drew a Parallel be∣tween the Jewish, and our Church, urging, <HI>How God required all Things to be made according to the Pattern given on the Mount.</HI> I answer'd; Before the Parallel could be just, it must be proved, that every Thing enjoined in our Church was as much a divine Institution as any Rite or Ceremony under the Jewish Dispensation. I added farther, That I saw regenerate Souls among the Baptists, among the Presbyterians, among the Independants, and among the Church Folks; all Children of God, and yet all born again in a different Way of Wor∣ship; and who then can tell which is the most evan∣gelical? <HI>What,</HI> says the Commissary, <HI>can you see Regeneration with your Eyes?</HI> or something to that Purpose. Soon after we began to talk of the RIGH∣TEOUSNESS OF CHRIST: And the Commissary said <HI>Christ was to make up the Defects of our Righ∣teousness.</HI> I ask'd him, if Conversion was not in∣stantanious? He was unwilling to confess it; but having just before baptised an Infant at publick Worship; I ask'd him, Whether he believed that very Instant in which he sprinkled the Child with
<PB N="50" REF="004848_0026_100E01C28041F2D0"/>
Water, the Holy Ghost fell upon the Child? He answer'd, <HI>Yes.</HI> Then, says I, according to your own Principles, Regeneration is instantanious, and since you will judge of the New-Birth by the Fruits, pray watch that Child, and see if it brings forth the Fruits of the Spirit. I also said, That if every Child was really born again in Baptism, then every baptised Infant would be saved. <HI>And so they are,</HI> says Dr. <HI>Cutler.</HI> How do you prove that? <HI>Why,</HI> says he, <HI>the Rubrick says, That all Infants dying af∣ter Baptism, before they commit actual Sin, are un∣doubtedly saved.</HI> I ask'd, What Text of Scripture there was to prove it? <HI>Here,</HI> says he (holding a Prayer-Book in his Hand) <HI>the Church says so.</HI> We then just hinted at Predestination: I said, I sub∣scribed to the 17th Article of the Church in its plain literal Sense, with all my Heart. We then talk'd a little about finally falling away from Grace. I said, a true Child of God, though he might fall fouly, yet could never fall finally. <HI>But,</HI> says he, <HI>the Article says, Men, may fall away from Grace given.</HI> But then, says I, observe what follows, <HI>And by the Grace of God, they may rise again.</HI> Se∣veral other Things of less Consequence passed be∣tween us; but being engag'd to dine at my Lodg∣ing, and finding how inconsistent they were, I took my Leave, resolving they should not have the Opportunity of denying me their Pulpits. How∣ever, they treated me with more Civility than any Set of our own Clergymen have done a long While.</P>
<P>The Commissary very kindly urged me to dine with him, but being pre-engaged, I went to my Lodging, and in the Afternoon preached to about
<PB N="51" REF="004848_0026_100E01C28041F2D0"/>
4000 People in Dr. <HI>Colman</HI>'s Meeting-House, and as afterwards, I was told by several, with great Suc∣cess. In the Evening, I exhorted and prayed, with as many as came to my Lodgings, and in∣wardly rejoiced at the Prospect there was of bring∣ing many Souls in <HI>Boston</HI> to the saving Knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ. <HI>Grant this O Father for thy dear Son's sake.</HI> Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Sept.</HI> 20. Perceived myself grow more and more comfortable both in Body and Soul; Was sweetly refresh'd by several Packets of Let∣ters sent me from different Parts in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> giving me an Account of the Success of of the Gospel; tho' was a little cast down to find some English Friends had thrown aside the Use of Means, and others were disputing for sinless Perfection, universal Redemption. I know no such Thing asserted in the Gospel, if explain'd aright. <HI>Lord, do thou cause even this to Work for Good, and give me Grace to oppose such Errors, without Respect to Persons, but with Meekness, Humility, and Love, Amen, Lord Jesus,</HI> Amen, and Amen.</P>
<P>Preached in the Morning with much Freedom and Power, to about 6000 Hearers in Dr. <HI>Sewall</HI>'s Meeting-House, afterwards on the Common to a∣bout 8000, and again at Night to a thronged Company at my own Lodgings; and then spent the Remainder of the Evening with a few choice Friends in preparing for the Sabbath. <HI>Oh that it may be a Day of heavenly Rest, sacred to divine Love. Oh! that we may be always in the Spirit on the Lord's Day!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="004848_0027_100E01C579C0FD08"/>
<HI>Sunday, Sept.</HI> 21. Went this Morning to hear Dr. <HI>Colman</HI> preach; din'd with his Colleague Mr. <HI>Cooper,</HI> and preach'd in the Afternoon to a very thronged Auditory, and with great and visible Effects at Mr. <HI>Foxcroft'</HI>s Meeting-House: Imme∣diately after on the Common to about 15,000, and again at my Lodging as usual, to a greater Com∣pany than before, some afterwards came up into my Room, I felt much of the divine Presence in my own Soul; and though hoarse, was enabled to speak with much Power, and could have spoke I believe 'till Midnight. To see the People so wil∣ling to hear, makes me forget myself. <HI>Oh that it may be my Sleep, my Meat, and Drink to do the Will of my heavenly Father! Oh that all who come to hear the Word, may take the Kingdom of God by Force.</HI> Amen and Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Monday, Sept.</HI> 22. Preached in the Morning at Mr. <HI>Webb'</HI>s Meeting-House, to about 6000 Hear∣ers in the House, besides great Numbers standing about the Doors. The Presence of the Lord was amongst them. Look where I would around me, visible Impressions were made upon the Auditory; Most wept for a considerable Time. But what I must give the Preference to, was that gracious Season at the New-North, on Wednesday the 8th of <HI>October,</HI> where there was more of the Pre∣sence of God through the whole of the Ministra∣tion, than ever I had known at one Time through the whole Course of my Life. Justly might it have been said of that Place, <HI>It was no other than the House of God and the Gate of Heaven.</HI> Oh how dreadful was the Places and yet Oh how

delightful! The LORD JESUS seem'd to be visibly walking in that his Golden Candlestick, to try some of the many Thousands that were then pre∣sent. But Oh, how few were prepared for so holy an Inquisition? I am sure I know one, who could not but tremble at the Thoughts of it; and who indeed could help crying out, <HI>Wo is me, for I am undone, because I am a Man of unclean Lips, for mine Eyes have seen the</HI> KING <HI>the</HI> LORD <HI>of Hosts.</HI> Indeed my own Soul was so deeply abased and overwhelm'd with such unusual Meltings, that I could have been glad of some private Corner in that House to pour out my Soul without Distur∣bance to the Audience. The Spirit of God indeed, seemed moving upon the Face of the Waters at that Time; and who knows but that to a great many Souls God was pleased to say, <HI>Let there be Light, and there was Light.</HI></P>
<P>In the Afternoon I went to preach at Mr. <HI>Checkley'</HI>s Meeting-House; but God was pleased to humble us by a very awful Providence. For when the Meeting-House was filled with People, tho' there was no real Danger, on a sudden the People were all in an Uproar, and so unacountably surprized, that some threw themselves out of the Windows, others threw themselves out of the Gal∣leries, and others trampled upon one another so that some were actually killed, and others dangerously wounded. I happened to come in the midst of the Uproar, and saw two or three lying on the Ground in a pitiable Condition: God was pleased to give me Presence of Mind, so that I gave Notice. I would immediately preach in the Common. The
<PB N="54" REF="004848_0028_100E01C70631C8F0"/>
Weather was wet, but above eight Thousand fol∣lowed into the Fields, to whom, I preached from these Words, <HI>Go out into the High-Ways &amp; Hedges and compel them to come in.</HI> I endeavour'd, as God ena∣bled me, to improve what had befallen us, and tho' Satan in this has bruised our Heels; yet I doubt not but even this will be a Means of bruising his accursed Head. <HI>Lord thy Judgments are like the great Deep, thy Footsteps are not known, just and holy art thou, O King of Saints.</HI></P>
<P>In the Evening perceived myself weak in Body so that I could not say much at the House where I supped; but God, by his blessed Spirit, greatly refreshed and comforted my Soul. Blessed be God, I find what our Saviour says, exceeding true, <HI>He that believeth on me as the Scripture hath spoken, out of his Belly shall flow Rivers of living Waters.</HI> I drink of God's Pleasures as out of a River. <HI>Oh that all were made Partakers of this living Water,</HI>—<HI>they would never thirst after the deadly Pleasures of this lower World.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, Sept.</HI> 23. Went this Morning with Dr. <HI>Colman</HI> and the Secretary to <HI>Roxbury,</HI> three Miles from <HI>Boston,</HI> to see one Mr. <HI>Walter,</HI> a good old Puritan, who with his Predecessor Mr. <HI>Eliot,</HI> commonly called the Apostle of the Indians, but now with God, have been Pastors of that Congre∣gation 106 Years. I had but little Conversation with him, my Stay was so very short; but I re∣member he told me, he was glad to hear I said, <HI>Man was half a Devil, and half a Beast.</HI> The more People drink into God's Spirit, the more I find they are inclined to debase the natural Man.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="004848_0028_100E01C70631C8F0"/>
About 11 we returned, and I preached in Mr. <HI>Gee'</HI>s Meeting-House, but not to a very crowded Auditory, because People were in doubt where I would preach. Dined at the Secretary's. Preach∣ed in the Afternoon at Dr. <HI>Sewall'</HI>s to a thronged Congregation, and exhorted and prayed as usual at my own Lodging; at neither Place without some Manifestation of a divine Power accompanying the Word.—<HI>Lord, let thy Presence always follow me, or otherwise I shall be but as a sounding Brass, or a tinkling Cymbal.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wednesday, Sept.</HI> 24. Went this Morning to see and preach at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> the chief College for training up the Sons of the Prophets in all <HI>New-England.</HI> It has one President, four Tutors, up∣wards of one hundred Students: It is scarce as big as one of our least Colleges in <HI>Oxford;</HI> and as far as I could gather from some who well knew the State of it, not far superiour to our Universities in Piety and true Godliness.—Tutors neglect to pray with and examine the Hearts of their Pupils. Discipline is at too low an Ebb: Bad Books are become fashionable amongst them:—<HI>Tillotson</HI> and <HI>Clark</HI> are read instead of <HI>Sheppard, Stoddard,</HI> and such like evangelical Writers, and therefore I chose to preach from those Words, <HI>We are not as many who corrupt the Word of God:</HI> And in the Conclusion of my Sermon, I made a close Ap∣plication to Tutors and Students. A great Num∣ber of neighbouring Ministers attended, as indeed, they do at all other Times, and God gave me great Freedom and Boldness of Speech. The President of the College, and Minister of the Parish, treated
<PB N="56" REF="004848_0029_100E01C88F7B9B98"/>
me very civilly. In the Afternoon I preached again in the College-Yard, without particular Ap∣plication to the Students: I believe there were 7000 Hearers:—The Holy Spirit melted many Hearts. The Word was attended with a mani∣fest Power: And a Minister soon after wrote me Word, that he believed one of his Daughters was savingly wrought upon at that Time. <HI>Lord, add daily to thy Church such as shall he saved.</HI></P>
<P>Paid my Respects to the Lieutenant Gover∣nour, who lives at <HI>Cambridge;</HI> returned in the Evening to <HI>Boston,</HI> and exhorted and prayed with many People, who were waiting round the Door for a spiritual Morsel. I believe our Lord did not send them empty away. <HI>Blessed Jesus, Feed them all with the Bread of Life which cometh down from Heaven.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday, Sept.</HI> 25. Preached the Weekly-Lec∣ture at Mr. <HI>Foxcroft'</HI>s Meeting-House, but was so oppressed with such a Sense of my base Ingratitude to my dearest Saviour, that Satan would fain have tempted me to hold my Tongue, and not invite poor Sinners to Jesus Christ, because I was so great a Sinner my self: But God enabled me to with∣stand the Temptation: And since Jesus Christ had shewn such Mercy to and did not withdraw his Holy Spirit from me, the chief of Sinners, I was enabled the more feelingly to talk of his Love: And afterwards found that one Stranger in parti∣cular, was in all Probability, effectually convinced by that Morning's Sermon. After publick Wor∣ship, I went at his Excellency's Invitation, and dined with the Governour; most of the Ministers
<PB N="57" REF="004848_0029_100E01C88F7B9B98"/>
of the Town were invited with me. Before Din∣ner, the Governour sent for me up into his Cham∣ber: He wept, wish'd me good Success in the Name of the Lord, and recommended himself, Ministers, and People to my Prayers. Immediately after Dinner, at the Governour's Motion, I prayed ex∣plicitly for them all; went in his Coach to the End of the Town, but had such a Sense of my Vileness upon my Soul, that I wondred People did not stone me. Cross'd the Ferry, and preached at <HI>Charlestown,</HI> a Town lying on the North-Side of <HI>Boston:</HI> The Meeting-House was very capacious, and quite filled; a gracious Melting was discerna∣ble thro' the whole Congregation, and I perceived much Freedom and Sweetness in my own Soul; tho' the Damp I felt in the Morning was not quite gone off. <HI>Oh when shall I be free from in∣dwelling-Sin! O Lord deliver me from the Body of this Death.</HI></P>
<P>In the Evening I exhorted and prayed as usual at my Lodging: And blessed be God, I found a great Alteration in the Hearers; they now be∣gan to melt and weep under the Word. <HI>Oh that the Lord may beat them down with the Hammer of his Word, 'till the Heart of Stone be entirely taken away. Even so Lord Jesus,</HI> Amen and Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Friday, Sept.</HI> 26. Preach'd in the Morning at <HI>Roxbury</HI> from a little Ascent to many Thousands of People, with much of the divine Presence amongst us. Several I think came afterwards to me telling how they were struck at that Time under the Word, and a Minister wrote to me thus,</P>

<P>AFTER my sincere Affection and very hum∣ble Service to you, I return you my hearty Thanks for your good Services Yester∣day, and especially at <HI>Roxbury,</HI> my native Place. I can't but admire and greatly rejoice in those extraordinary Gifts and Graces which it has pleased the Father of Lights to confer upon you, and to see how much the Intention of them is answer'd in your flaming Devotion, and zealous and indefatigable Endeavours to do Good to Souls, and thereby advance the King∣dom and Interest of our dearest Lord.—I think I never saw a more attentive Audience, or more weeping Eyes than Yesterday and Monday.—The Holy Spirit, the alone Author of spiritual Life, seem'd in a very wonderful Manner to be moving upon the Waters of the Sanctuary, breathing upon the dry Bones.—For my own Part, I was much affected, for which I desire to give our glorious Lord the Praise.</P>

<P>Dined at Judge <HI>Dudley'</HI>s: Preached in the Af∣ternoon from a Scaffold erected without Mr. <HI>Byles'</HI>s Meeting-House, to near double the Number as in the Morning; snatched a few Moments to write a few Lines to Friends at <HI>England,</HI> gave a short Exhortation to a great Crowd of People, and spent the Remainder of the Evening with several Mini∣sters at Mr. <HI>H</HI>—<HI>n'</HI>s; our Conversation tended to the Use of Edifying.

<P><HI>Saturday, Sept.</HI> 27. Preach'd this Morning at Mr. <HI>Welsteed'</HI>s Meeting-House. Dined with Col. <HI>Wendell.</HI> And preach'd in the Afternoon on the Common to about 15000 People. But Oh how did the Word run! It rejoiced me to see such Numbers greatly affected, so that some of them I believe could scarcely abstain from crying out, <HI>That that Place was no other than a</HI> Bethel, <HI>and the Gate of Heaven.</HI> After Sermon, I visited, and prayed with two different Persons, that were much hurt in the late Fright, and then went home to my Lodgings.—The Power, and Presence of the Lord accompanied, and followed me.—Many now wept exceedingly, and cryed out under the Word, like Persons that were really hungring and thrist∣ing after Righteousness. And after I left them God gave me to wrestle with him in my Chamber in Behalf of some dear Friends then present, and others that were absent from us; the Spirit of the Lord was upon them all, it made Intercession with Groanings that cannot be uttered. <HI>Oh let them en∣ter into thy Ears, O Lord of Sabaoth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, Sept.</HI> 28. Preach'd in the Morning at Dr. <HI>Sewall'</HI>s Meeting-House, to a very crowded Auditory, and almost with as much Power and visible Appearance of God among us as Yesterday in the Afternoon. Collected <HI>l.</HI> 555 for my little Lambs, was taken very ill after Dinner; vomited violently, but was enabled to preach at Dr. <HI>Col∣man'</HI>s in the Afternoon to as great if not greater began to question whether

Here also <HI>l.</HI> 470 were collected for the Orphan-House in <HI>Georgia,</HI> in both Places all Things were carried on with great Decency and Order; People went slowly out, as though they had not a Mind to escape giving; and Dr. <HI>Colman</HI> said, it was the most pleasant Time he ever had enjoyed in that Meeting-House through the whole Course of his Life. Blessed be God; after Sermon, I perceived my self somewhat refreshed. Supped very early. Had the Honour of a private Visit from the Go∣vernor, who came full of Affection, to take his Leave of me for the present. Went at their Re∣quest, and preach'd to a great Number of the Ne∣groes on the Conversion of the <HI>AEthiopian, Acts</HI> 8. At which the poor Creatures, as well as many white People, were much affected; and at my Return, gave a Word of Exhortation to a Crowd of People who were waiting at my Lodgings. My animal Spirits were almost exhausted; and my Legs, through Expence of Sweat and Vomiting, almost ready to sink under me; but the Lord vi∣sited my Soul, and I went to Bed greatly refreshed with divine Consolations. <HI>Oh, what am I that I should thus daily be fed with heavenly Manna? Lord thou fillest my Soul with Marrow and Fatness. O let me praise thee with joyful Lips!</HI></P>

<P><HI>Monday, Sept.</HI> 29. Set out about 7 in the Morning, got to <HI>Marblehead,</HI> a large Town 20 Miles from <HI>Boston,</HI> about 11; preach'd to some Thousands in a broad Place in the middle of the

Rode to <HI>Salem,</HI> 4 Miles from <HI>Marblehead,</HI> and preach'd there also to about 7000 People: Here the Lord manifested forth his Glory. One Man was, I believe, struck down by the Power of the Word. In every Part of the Congregation Persons might be seen under great Concern: One Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI> a good Minister, as is granted by all Lovers of God, seemed to be almost in Heaven. <HI>Salem</HI> is the first settled, and except <HI>Boston,</HI> the largest Town in all <HI>New-England;</HI> but rather, as far as I could see and hear, excells it for Politeness. Upon Enquiry, I found the Inhabitants had been sadly divided about their Minister; and God was pleased, before I knew their Circumstances, to di∣rect me to a suitable Subject. Lord, heal their Divisions, and grant that with one Heart and one Mind they may endeavour to glorify thy holy Name. After the Exercise, I immediately set out and got to <HI>Ipswich,</HI> another large Town, 16 Miles (the Way we went) distant from <HI>Salem.</HI> Two or three Gentlemen came to meet me, and I and my Friends were kindly entertain'd at the House of Mr. <HI>R</HI>—<HI>rs,</HI> one of the Ministers of the Place. <HI>The Lord reward him, and all others a thousand Fold, who refresh our Bowels in the Lord.</HI></P>

Blessed be God, his divine Power attends us more and more. Took Ferry immediately after Sermon; went with Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> Minister of the Place, who came to meet me in a Chaise to <HI>Hamp∣ton,</HI> another great Town, 9 Miles from <HI>Newbury.</HI> The Night was both dark, and rainy; but he, with whom the Darkness is no Darkness, brought us in Safety to <HI>Hampton,</HI> where I was pleased to see more Plainness in Mr. <HI>Cotton'</HI>s House than I had seen in any Minister's House since my Arrival. His Wife was as one that serveth. Oh that all Ministers Wives were so: For there is nothing gives me more Offence than to see Clergymens Wives dressed out in the Pride of Life; they bring a Reproach upon Religion; they generally live up to the utmost of their Income, and being above working after their Husbands Decease, they are of all Women the most miserable. <HI>From such a Wife good Lord of thy infinite Mercy deliver my Soul.</HI></P>

Some, tho' not many, were affected. God's Spirit blow∣eth when and where it listeth. After Dinner rode in Company with many to <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> a large
<PB N="63" REF="004848_0032_100E01CF8C57F920"/>
Town about 14 Miles from <HI>Hampton,</HI> got thither in about an Hour and half; preach'd to a polite Auditory; but so very unconcern'd, that I began to question whether I had been speaking to rati∣onal, or brute Creatures. Seeing no immediate Effects of the Word preach'd, I was a little de∣jected; but God to comfort my Heart, sent one young Man, crying out in great Anguish of Spirit, <HI>What shall I do to be saved?</HI> Oh, how does God pity the Weakness of his Children, why wast thou so cast down O my Soul? Crossed a Ferry immediately after Sermon, and went over a very stony Way to <HI>York,</HI> a Town 13 Miles round the Ferry, distant from <HI>Portsmouth:</HI> Hither I came to see one Mr. <HI>Moody,</HI> a worthy, plain and powerful Minister of Jesus Christ; though now much impaired by old Age; he has lived by Faith for many Years; wou'd have no settled Salary; and has been much despised by the Haters, and as much respected by the true Lovers of the blessed Jesus. He came as far as <HI>Hampton</HI> to meet me, but getting before him in our Night travelling, a Physician, his Neighbour, who came also to meet me, receiv'd me into his House, and kindly entertain'd us. Some of our Fellow-Travellers lost their Way, but came to us sometime after our Arrival at <HI>York.</HI> Here we sup∣ped and prayed very comfortably together. The Air agreed mightily with my Constitution. As I came along I was surpriz'd to see such Improve∣ments made in the Space of 100 Years, and could not but fancy myself in <HI>Old-England:</HI> Surely God is a God keeping Covenant. He has blessed the present Generation for their Fathers Sake with all

<P><HI>Thursday, October</HI> 2. Was much comforted to hear good Mr. <HI>Moody</HI> tell me, that he believed I shou'd preach to an Hundred new Creatures this Morning in his Congregation: and indeed I be∣lieve I did; for when I came to preach I could speak little or no Terror, but most Consolation: I preach'd both Morning and Evening. The Hearers looked plain and simple, and Tears trick∣led apace down most of their Cheeks. Indeed we saw the Outgoings of the Lord in his Sanctuary. But one Thing put a little Damp upon my Soul, and I hope did me good. Mr. <HI>Moody</HI> has a Son a Minister, who was once full of Faith and Joy in the Holy Ghost, and walk'd in the Light of God's Countenance, and made full Proof of his Ministry, but for these two Years last past, has walked in Darkness, and saw no Light. He has an inexpres∣sible Gloominess upon his Soul, and cannot apply any of the Promises to himself. I was informed that he was at Meeting, but dared not see me: I was assisted to pray for him, and so much the more earnestly, not knowing but his Case might be mine hereafter. <HI>Lord, let me not be high minded, but fear; into thy Hands I commend my Spirit; I de∣sire to take no Thought for the Morrow; deal with me as shall please thee. Justly mayst thou take every Thing from me; for I have wretchedly abused thy Loving-kindness. God be merciful to me a Sinner.</HI></P>

Left <HI>York</HI> about 4 in the Evening, reach'd <HI>Ports∣mouth</HI> by Night, where I supped, conversed, and sung Psalms very comfortably with my Friends: The Lord was pleased to lift up the Light of his blessed Countenance more and more upon my Soul; rightly is Jesus called <HI>Emanuel,</HI> he is God, not only with, but in us. <HI>Oh that I may never provoke him to depart from me!</HI></P>

<P><HI>Friday, October</HI> 3. Preach'd this Morning at <HI>Portsmouth</HI> to a far greater Congregation, and blessed be God, with much better Effect than be∣fore. Instead of preaching to dead Stocks, I now had Reason to believe I was preaching to living Men. People began to melt, soon after I began to pray, and the Power encreased more and more, during the whole Sermon. The Word seemed to pierce through and through, and carried such Con∣victions along with it, that many who before had industriously spoken Evil of me, were made asham'd of themselves. Mr. <HI>Shurtleff</HI> the Minister, when he afterwards sent me <HI>l.</HI> 97 7 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> collected at this Time for the Orphan-House, wrote thus, <Q>You have left Numbers here under deep Im∣pressions; and I trust in God they will not all wear off, but that the Convictions of some will be kept up and cherished till they have had their desired Effect.</Q> <HI>Amen and Amen.</HI></P>

Set out from <HI>Salem</HI> about 9, preached at <HI>Marblehead</HI> about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and with such Power that I trust it will be a Day much to be remembred by many Souls. I was upon the Mount my self, and the Lord attended his Word with mighty Power. The two Ministers presented me <HI>l.</HI> 70 2s. 6 <HI>d.</HI> for the Orphan-House, which they had voluntarily collected Yesterday in their own private Meetings.

<P>At the Intreaty of Mr. <HI>Emerson,</HI> Son-in-Law to dear Mr. <HI>Moody,</HI> I believe a real Man of God; we went to <HI>Malden,</HI> 14 Miles from <HI>Marblehead,</HI> where I preached not with so much Power as in the Morning. But one Girl came crying to me and saying, She feared she had not true Faith in Jesus. Oh that thousands others began to doubt also! Here the Secretary and several Friends from <HI>Boston</HI> gave us the meeting; with them after Ser∣mon, I immediately sat out, and got privately in∣to <HI>Boston</HI> about 7 at Night.

<P>Perceived my Health to be much improved since I left <HI>Boston;</HI> and though I rode 178 Miles, and preached 16 Times, I trust to the great Benefit of Thousands, yet I was not in the least wearied or fatigued. The Spirit of the Lord was upon me; and I sat up till near Mid-night to answer Correspon∣dents, and settle my private Affairs. Afterwards I went to Rest, full of Peace, and desiring to be thankful to the Lord for causing me thus to renew my Strength. <HI>O what a good Master is Jesus Christ?</HI></P>

<P><HI>Tuesday, Octob.</HI> 7. Preach'd both Morning and Evening in Dr. <HI>Colmans'</HI>s Meeting-House; both Times with much Power. People seem'd greatly rejoiced at my Arrival, it being confidently reported that I died suddenly, or was poisoned: But I find I must not yet die, but live and declare the Works of the Lord. Father, I submit; thy Will be done. Visited I believe a true Disciple, who had been sick for a long Season; the Lord has made his Bed in his Sickness. He has been enabled to rejoice in Tribulation. Who wou'd but be a Christian? Supped and gave a Word of Exhortation to many People at a House, which I trust the Lord will visit with his Salvation. Wherever I go, People will follow me: And I now hourly almost receive Let∣ters from Persons under Convictions, and congra∣tulatory Letters and Visits from many Children of God, whose Souls have been abundantly refreshed by the Ministration of the Word. <HI>Blessed be God,

<P><HI>Wednesday, Octob.</HI> 8. Went with the Gover∣nour in his Coach to Mr. <HI>Webb'</HI>s Meeting-House, where I preached both Morning and Evening to very great Auditories both Times, especially in the Morning: Jesus Christ manifested forth his Glory; many Hearts melted within them; &amp; I think I was never so drawn out to pray for and invite little Children to Jesus Christ, as I was this Morning. A little before, I had heard of a Child who was taken sick just after it had heard me preach, and said, He would go to Mr. <HI>Whitefield'</HI>s God; and died in a short Time. This encouraged me to speak to the little Ones. But Oh, how were the old People affected when I said, Little Children, if your Pa∣rents will not come to Christ, do you come and go to Heaven without them. There seemed to be but few dry Eyes look where I would. The Word smote them, I believe, through and through; and my own Soul was very much carried out. Surely it was the Lord's Passover. I have not seen a greater Commotion since my preaching at <HI>Boston.</HI> Glory be to God who has not forgotten to be gracious. At the same Time was collected <HI>l.</HI> 440. Went with the Governour, who seemed more and more affected, in his Coach to my Lodgings.—Snatch'd a few Moments to write a Letter or two; gave a Word of Exhortation to a great Crowd of People, and then slipped out privately at a back Door and went and supped at a Man's House, whose Wife and Sister, as well as himself, I trust

<P><HI>Thursday, October</HI> 9. Have been applied to, this and every Morning since my return, by many Souls under deep Distress; and was only grieved that I could not have more Time with them. Preached this Morning the publick Lecture at Dr. <HI>Sewall'</HI>s Meeting-House, which was very much crowded. When I left my Lodgings, I had fixed on, and folded down a particular Text, but when I came near the Meeting-House I found it much impressed upon my Heart, that I should preach up∣on our Lord's Conference with <HI>Nicodemus:</HI> I ac∣quainted a Friend with it. When I came into the Pulpit, I saw a great Number of Ministers sitting around and before me, and when I came to those Words, <HI>Art thou a Master of</HI> Israel <HI>and knowest not these Things?</HI> The Lord enabled me to open my Mouth boldly against unconverted Ministers; to caution Tutors to take Care of their Pupils: And also to advise Ministers particularly to examine into the Experiences of Candidates for Ordination. For I am verily persuaded the Generality of Preachers talk of an unknown unfelt Christ. And the Reason why Congregations have been so dead, is because they have had dead Men preaching to them. Oh that the Lord may quicken and revive them, for his own Names Sake. For how can dead Men beget liv∣ing Children? It's true indeed, God may convert People by the Devil if he pleases, and so he may by unconverted Ministers. But I believe he seldom makes Use of either of them for this Purpose. No, the Lord will chuse Vessels made meet by the
<PB N="71" REF="004848_0036_100E01E7AAAECDB8"/>
Operations of the blessed Spirit for his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> And as for my own Part, I wou'd not lay Hands on an unconverted Man for ten thousand Worlds. Unspeakable Freedom God gave me while treating on this Head. After Sermon I dined with the Go∣vernor, who seemed more kindly affected than ever; and particularly told one of the Minister's who had lately began to preach extempore, that he was very glad he had found out a Way to save his Eyes. Oh that others wou'd follow him; I believe they would find the Lord ready to help and assist them. In the Afternoon I preached in the Common to about 15000 People, and collected upwards of <HI>l.</HI> 200 for the Orphan-House. Just as I had finished my Sermon a Ticket was put up to me, wherein I was desired to pray for a Person just enter'd upon the Ministry; but under Apprehensions that he was not converted. God enabled me to pray for him with my whole Heart; and I hope that Ticket will teach many others not to run before they can give an Account of their Conversion: If they do, they offer God strange Fire. Went to the Funeral of one belonging to the Council; but do not like the Custom at <HI>Boston</HI> of not speaking at the Grave. When can Ministers Prayers and Ex∣hortations be more suitable, than when the Corps before will silently as it were assist them, and with a kind of dumb Oratory bid the Spectators consider their latter End. When the Funeral was over, I went as privately as possible to the Alms-House and enlarged on these Words, <HI>The Poor receive the Gospel;</HI> for near half an Hour. Then I went to the Work-House, where I prayed with and exhorted a great
<PB N="72" REF="004848_0037_100DEEF6B52ECAB8"/>
Number of People, who crowded after me, besides those belonging to the House, for an Hour more. Then hearing there was a considerable Number waiting for me at my Lodgings (tho' some cryed out, Spare thy self) God strengthned me to go and give them a spiritual Morsel; and then I went and eat Bread comfortably at a Friend's House, whi∣ther I was invited, and soon after retired to my Rest. Oh how sweet Sleep is after working for Jesus. <HI>Lord, strengthen me yet a little longer, and then let me sleep in thee, never to awake in this vain World again. Still I must intreat thee, if most conducive to thy Glory and the Good of Souls, to make no long tarrying, O my God.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Saturday, October</HI> 11. Was but weak in Body, and perceived I had taken cold.—But preaching I find a constant Remedy against all slight Indispositions. Went to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> 4 miles from <HI>Medford</HI> &amp; preach∣ed at the Meeting-House Door, to a great Body of People, who stood very attentively, tho' it rained, and were at the latter Part of the Sermon much affected. It being at the University, I discoursed on these Words—<HI>Noah the eighth Person a Preacher of Righteousness:</HI> And endeavoured to shew the Qualifications proper for a true evangelical Preacher of Christ's Righteousness. The Lord opened my Mouth, and I spoke very plainly to Tutors and Pu∣pils. <HI>l.</HI> 100 were collected for the Orphans. After Sermon the President very kindly entertained me and my Friends. About 4 we reached <HI>Boston.</HI> I preached immediately at Dr. <HI>Sewall'</HI>s Meeting-House, exhorted a great Company afterwards at my Lodgings, and then was employed till near Midnight in settling my private Affairs, answering Letters, and speaking to Souls under Convictions. One little Girl came to me about eight Years old, under deep Convictions. She, as her Friends told
<PB N="74" REF="004848_0038_100E01D874B5AED0"/>
me, had been wrestling for Christ: And whilst she was wrestling it came to her mind, that Jesus being in an Agony, prayed yet so much the more earnestly; and that an Angel was sent from Hea∣ven to strengthen him. This encouraged her to persevere, and her Soul soon received some Comfort. Another Minister's little Daughter has been quite restless after Christ Night and Day. And a young Man about fourteen came to me crying, saying, Sir, I am convicted, but not comforted, O pray for me. <HI>I thank thee holy Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, that thou hast hid these Things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto Babes: Even so Father, for so it seemed good in thy Sight.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, October</HI> 12. Perceived I was much re∣fresh'd in Body and Soul when I rose in the Mor∣ning. Spoke to as many as I could that came for spiritual Advice. Preach'd with great Power and Affection at Dr. <HI>Sewall'</HI>s Meeting-House, which was so exceedingly thronged, that I was obliged to get in at one of the Windows. Dined with the Governour, who came to me after Dinner when I was retir'd; and weeping most earnestly, desired my Prayers. The Lord be with and in him for Time and Eternity. Went and heard Dr. <HI>Sewall</HI> preach in the Afternoon. Was sick at Meeting, and also after it was over. Went with the Governour in his Coach, to the Common, where I preached my Farewel-Sermon to near 30,000 People. A Sight I have not seen since I left <HI>Black-Heath,</HI> &amp; a Sight perhaps never before seen in all <HI>America.</HI> It being duskish before I had done, the Sight was more so∣lemn. Numbers, great Numbers melted into Tears
<PB N="75" REF="004848_0038_100E01D874B5AED0"/>
when I talked of leaving them. I was very parti∣cular in my Application, both to Rulers, Ministers and People, commended what was commendable, and blamed what was blame-worthy, and exhorted them steadily to imitate the Piety of their Fore-Fathers,—that whether I was present or whether I was absent I might hear of their Affairs, that with one Heart and one Mind they were striving together for the Faith of the Gospel. After Ser∣mon the Governour went with me to my Lodg∣ings, I stood in the Passage and spoke to a great Company, both within and without the Doors.—But they were so deeply affected and cried out so loud, that I was obliged to leave off praying. The Governour was highly pleased to see the Power of God. He took his leave in the most affectionate Manner, and said he would come and take me in his Coach to <HI>Charlestown</HI> Ferry the morrow Mor∣ning. The remainder of the Evening was almost intirely taken up in speaking to Souls deeply woun∣ded by the Word. The poor Girl that followed me from <HI>Roxbury</HI> I believe had a saving Discovery of Jesus Christ this Morning. For when I prea∣ched on these Words, THE LORD OUR RIGH∣TEOUSNESS; she was enabled to say, The Lord <HI>my</HI> Righteousness. Her Soul received Comfort, and she knew her Sins were forgiven her; and was not afraid to die. Poor Creature, I found upon Inquiry, she could not read, which shews the So∣vereignty of God's electing Love, and confirms what the Apostle says, That the Lord chuses the foolish Things of this World to confound the wise. Many offer'd to go with me to <HI>Georgia;</HI> and Cha∣rity

I believe will incline me to take her. For she's cast out in effect already for Christ's Sake. Blessed be God for what he has done at <HI>Boston.</HI> I hope a glorious Work is now begun, and that the Lord will stir up some faithful I Labourers to carry it on. <HI>Boston</HI> is a large populous Place, very weal∣thy. Has the Form kept up very well; but has lost much of the Power of Religion. I have not heard of any remarkable Stir in it for these many Years. Ministers and People are obliged to con∣fess, that the Love of many is waxed cold. Both for the generality seem too much conformed to the World. There's much of the Pride of Life to be seen in their Assemblies: Jewels, Patches, and gay Apparel are commonly worn by the female Sex; little Boys and Girls, I observed commonly dressed up in the Pride of Life; and the little In∣fants that were brought to Baptism, were wrapped in such fine Things and so much Pains taken to dress them, that one would think they were brought thither to be initiated into, rather than renounce the Pomps and Vanities of this wicked World.—There are nine Meeting-Houses of the congregati∣onal Persuasion, one Baptist, one French, one be∣longing to the Scotch-Irish, there are two monthly and one weekly Lecture, and that too but poorly at∣tended; several Ministers complained to me of it, I mentioned it in my Sermons, and I trust God will stir up the People more frequently to tread the Courts of the Lord's House. One Thing <HI>Boston</HI> is remarkable for,—The external Observation of the Sabbath; Men in civil Offices have a Regard for Religion: The Governour encourages them, and
<PB N="77" REF="004848_0039_100E01DAB7723E90"/>
the Ministers and Magistrates seem to be more uni∣ted than in any other Place where I have been.—Both were exceeding civil to me during my Stay. I never saw so little scoffing;—Never had so little Opposition: But one might easily foresee much would hereafter arise, when I come to be more particular in my Application to particular Persons; for I fear, many, many rest in a Head-Knowledge, are close Pharisees, and having only a Name to live. It must needs be so when the Power of Godliness is dwindled away, and the Form only of Religion is become fashionable amongst a People. However no doubt there are few a Names left in <HI>Sardis</HI> that have not defiled their Garments; many Letters came to me as far as I could judge from truly pious People, in which they heavily com∣plained of the sad Degeneracy of their Times, and hoped that God was now about to revive his Work in the midst o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Years. <HI>Even so Lord Jesus, Amen and Amen, say I with my whole Heart.</HI> For <HI>Boston</HI> People are dear to my Soul. They were greatly affected by the Word, followed Night and Day, and were very liberal to my dear Or∣phans. I promised, God willing, to visit them a∣gain, and intend to fulfil my Promise when it shall please God to bring me again from my native Coun∣try. In the mean while, dear <HI>Boston,</HI> adieu. <HI>The Lord be with thy Ministers and People, and grant that the Remnant which is yet left, according to the Election of Grace, may take Root downwards, and bear Fruit upwards, and fill the Land.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Friday, Octob.</HI> 17. Set out as soon as it was Light and reach'd <HI>Hadley,</HI> a Place where a great Work of God was begun some few Years ago. But lately the People of God have complained of Deadness, and losing their first Love. However, as soon as I mentioned what God had done for their Souls for∣merly, it was like putting Fire to Tinder. The Remembrance of it quicken'd them, caused many of them to weep sorely. When I had taken a lit∣tle Refreshment, we crossed the Ferry to <HI>Nor∣thampton,</HI> where no less than 300 Souls as was sup∣posed, were savingly brought home to the dear Lord Jesus about 5 or 6 Years ago.

Their Children were dressed not in Silks &amp; Sattins, but plain, as becomes the Children of those who in all Things ought to be Examples of Christian Sim∣plicity. She is a Woman adorned with a meek and quiet Spirit, and talked so feelingly and solidly of the Things of God, and seemed to be such a Helpmeet for her Husband, that she caused me to renew those Prayers, which for some Months I have put up to God, that he would be pleased to send me a Daugh∣ter of <HI>Abraham</HI> to be my Wife. I find upon many Accounts it is my Duty to marry. Lord I desire to have no Choice of my own. Thou knowest my Circumstances: Thou knowest I desire to mar∣ry only in and for thee.

Met with a little Book written by Dr. <HI>Cotton Mather,</HI> entitled, <HI>Orna∣ments for the Daughters of Zion:</HI> which I would re∣commend to all, especially the <HI>Boston</HI> Ladies.

The Meeting-House was full. God's Power was with me both Times, espe∣cially at the last.

I insisted much in my Discourse, upon the Doctrine of the New-Birth, and also the Necessity of a Minister's being converted before he could preach Christ a∣right.—The Word came with great Power, and a great Impression was made upon the People in all Parts of the Assembly; many Ministers were pre∣sent, I did not spare them,—most of them than∣ked me for my plain Dealing. But one was offer∣ded, and so would more of his Stamp if I was to continue longer in <HI>New England</HI>—For uncon∣verted
<PB N="86" REF="004848_0044_100E01E50FF7C8A8"/>
Ministers are the Bane of the Christian Church; and tho' I honour the Memory of that great and good Man, Mr. <HI>Stoddard,</HI> yet I think he is much to be blamed for endeavouring to prove that uncon∣verted Men might be admitted into the Ministry. How he has handled the Controversy, I know not. I think no solid Arguments can be brought to de∣fend such a Cause.—But the best of Men are per∣mitted to err, that we may know they were but Men. A Sermon lately published by Mr. <HI>Gilbert Tennent,</HI> entitled, <HI>The Danger of an unconverted Ministry,</HI> I think unanswerable. As I was riding to <HI>Windsor</HI> after Dinner, an old Man came up to me saying, He knew what I had preached in the Morning was true,—I have felt it, says he, I was under the Spirit of Bondage twenty Years, and have received the Spirit of Adoption 23 Years. Another came giving me an Account of his Expe∣riences, and the People of God seemed much revi∣ved at <HI>Windsor,</HI> where I am informed a true con∣verted Man is the Minister. I preached in the Af∣ternoon and with such Freedom, that a young Mi∣nister who had heard me several Times, told me, I had kept the good Wine until now. As soon as Sermon was over, I rode about a Mile, crossed a broad Ferry, walked about a Mile &amp; half, &amp; prea∣ched to a thronged Congregation, belonging to old Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> Father to Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> of <HI>Northamp∣ton,</HI> and I believe a true Disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ. My Body being something weak, I did not speak with that Strength as last Night, neither was I so much assisted; but it is the Lord, he knows best when to dispense, and when to suspend his Aids.

After Exercise I supped at the House of old Mr. <HI>Ed∣wards;</HI> his Wife was as aged, I believe, as himself, and if she was converted, (and I know nothing to the contrary) I fancied I was sitting in the House of a <HI>Zachary</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> Indeed I felt great Sa∣tisfaction in my own Soul, and parted from him and his Son (who came with me so far) with some in∣ward Regret. But blessed be God, we shall meet again in Eternity. <HI>Lord grant I may always comfort my self with this Thought!</HI></P>

Reach'd <HI>Hartford,</HI> 7 miles from <HI>Windsor,</HI> about 10 last Night: Preach'd to many Thousands, and with much Freedom &amp; Power in the Morning, and to about the same Number at <HI>Wethersfield,</HI> 3 miles from <HI>Hartford,</HI> in the After∣noon. Here my Soul was refreshed by the coming of Messi. <HI>Wheelock</HI> and <HI>Pomroy,</HI> two young faithful and zealous Ministers of Jesus Christ.

<SALUTE>Rev. and dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>MY Heart was last Night refreshed with the emi∣nent Experiences of</HI> John Sprague <HI>of this Place; the Lord has of late filled him almost Brim full, and there are many Christians among us that have of late been greatly enlightened &amp; come to a full Assurance. Oh! Dear Sir, help a poor Worm in Praises. I think Religion has in this Place rather gained Ground than declined for some Months. Several have been converted of late, &amp; remain very lively; O that the Lord would multiply that Number. There is observable among us a greater Spirit of Seriousness than has been usual.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="004848_0045_100DEEF3A3F6B5F8"/>
This Morning I intended to go and preach at both their Places; as also at <HI>Plymouth, Rhode-Island,</HI> &amp;c;. but God shewed me this Day it was inconsist∣ent with my other Business, upon many Accounts; and therefore after Prayer, and consulting with my Friends, I resolved to go directly to <HI>New-York;</HI> accordingly at Night, after writing a few Letters I rode to <HI>Middletown,</HI> 10 miles from <HI>Wethersfield,</HI> and was entertain'd at the House of Mr. <HI>Russel,</HI> the Minister of the Place, and I think an <HI>Israelite</HI> in∣deed, and one who has been long mourning over the Deadness of Professors. <HI>Oh that all Ministers were like minded.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Thursday, Octob.</HI> 23. Was much pleased with the Simplicity of my Host, and the Order wherein his Children attended on Family Devotions. Preach'd to about 4000 People (great Numbers of which were considerably affected) about 11 o'Clock. Preached again in the Afternoon at <HI>Wallignsford,</HI> 14 miles from <HI>Middletown,</HI> and then rode on to <HI>New-Haven,</HI> 14 miles farther, where I was affectionately receiv'd by Mr.<HI>Pierpoint,</HI> Brother to Mr.<HI>Edwards</HI> of <HI>Nor∣thampton.</HI> As I came along I found wonderful Free∣dom in my Soul for declining to go so long a Circuit as was proposed. I conversed profitably with Mr<HI>Lamb</HI> a godly zealous Minister of <HI>Guilford:</HI> And when I came to <HI>New-Haven</HI> I felt God strengthning my inner Man.

<P><HI>Friday, October</HI> 24. Was refreshed with the Sight of dear Mr.<HI>Noble</HI> of <HI>New-York,</HI> who also brought me Letters from <HI>Georgia.</HI> Blessed be God, the Or∣phan-House Affairs go on prosperously. The Lord is with my dear Family of a Truth. Declined preach∣ing in the Morning, because it was wet, the People had no Notice of my coming, and I had much pri∣vate Business on my Hands. Perceived my Health of Body grow better and better. Preached in the Afternoon with Power towards the latter End of the Sermon, and observed some deeply affected. It being the Time in which the Assembly sat, the Go∣vernour, Council and the Gentlemen of the lower House were present. After Sermon two young Ministers, who seemed to have some Experi∣ence of divine Things, came to converse with me, and in the Evening I expounded at my Lodgings to a Room full of People. The Power of the Lord was upon me. I spoke with much Weight and Freedom, and had sweet Fellowship with my dear Companions. <HI>Oh who would but travel for Christ.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, October</HI> 25. Was again refreshed this Morning by the Sight of Mr.<HI>Jedidiah Mills,</HI> a dear Man of God, Minister of <HI>Ripton,</HI> near <HI>Stratford.</HI> He wrote to me some time ago. I felt his Letter, and now also felt the Man. My Soul was much united to him, I could not but think God would do great Things by his Hands. He has had a re∣markable Work in his Parish some time ago; and talked like one that was no Novice in divine Things. With him I dined at Mr.<HI>Chap'</HI>s, Rector of <HI>New-Haven</HI> College; about one third as big as that at
<PB N="90" REF="004848_0046_100E01EA158EE008"/>
<HI>Cambridge.</HI> It has one Rector, three Tutors, and about 100 Students. But I hear of no remarkable Concern amongst them on Account of Religion. I preached twice, and I believe much to the Conso∣lation of God's People, many of which as I have heard live at <HI>New-Haven</HI> and the Countries round about. There were sweet meltings discernable both Times. I spoke very closely to the Students, and shewed the dreadful ill Consequences of an uncon∣verted Ministry. Dear Mr. <HI>Mills,</HI> and another Mi∣nister, came to my Lodgings after Sermon; they rejoiced in Spirit; and Mr. <HI>Mills,</HI> when he took his leave, told me of one Minister in particular who had been wrought upon before, but now was gone home as full as he could hold. <HI>Oh that God may quicken Ministers! Oh that the Lord may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> a flaming Fire! Come Lord Jesus, come quickly</HI> Amen and Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, October</HI> 26. Preached both Morning and Evening to much larger Congregations than before; and in the Afternoon observed an especial Presence of God in the Assembly. Many I believe, were comforted and quicken'd by the Holy Ghost. The People of God sent me Word that they were much revived; and one came and told me these Words were lately pressed upon upon her Heart, <HI>The Win∣ter is gone, the Spring is at Hand, the Voice of the Turtle is heard in the Land.</HI> Indeed I believe this will be an acceptable Year of the Lord. Before Evening Service the following Note was put into my Hands, by one who came to me a Day or two ago, some miles off, under great Distress, and tho' weak in Body, could not but follow after me. <HI>One self-righteous Pharisee resting in Duties who hath a

rational Belief of his damned Estate, and that he hath never felt the Pangs of the New-Birth, desires Prayers to that God that hath said, ye must be born again.</HI> After Sermon I waited on the Governour, an aged, grave, old Gentleman, well reported of by good Men. I observed him to be much affected under the Word; when I came in, he said, <HI>I am glad to see you, and heartily glad to hear you.</HI> But his Heart was so full that he could not speak much. The Tears trickled down his aged Cheeks like Drops of Rain. <HI>He was thankful to God,</HI> he said, <HI>for such Re∣freshings in the Way to our Rest. Food does us good,</HI> added he, <HI>when we eat it with an Appetite:</HI> And in∣deed I believe he had fed upon the Word. The Lord support him when his Strength faileth, and bring his gray Hairs with comfort to the Grave. In the Evening I expounded at my Lodgings to a great Number of People, and collected near <HI>l.</HI> 40 for the Orphans. My Soul was much refreshed to hear how the Children of God were revived by the Word preached. And nothing confirms me more that I have been taught of God, and preach the Truth as it is in Jesus, than to find our Lord's dear and old Disciples feeling the Power of the Word wherever I go, and saying, <HI>it agrees with their Experiences</HI>—<HI>My Sheep hear my Voice,</HI> says our dear Redeemer, a <HI>Stranger will they not hear.</HI> About 8 at Night we left <HI>New-Haven.</HI> The Moon shone bright, &amp; after we had rode three miles, we called at a House which as Mr. <HI>Wheelock,</HI> a faithful Minister of Jesus Christ told me before was full of God. I think they tell me the Mother and three Daughters were conver∣ted Persons. Assoon as I came into the House, the Spirit of the Lord came upon me, God gave

me to wrestle with him. And my Friends said at departing, They were never in such a House be∣fore. Oh it was a sweet Time indeed! God made his Power to be felt and known. After I had given a Word of Exhortation, <HI>That they would adorn the Gospel of our Lord in all Things,</HI> we went forward on our Journey and got to <HI>Milford,</HI> 10 miles from <HI>New-Haven,</HI> about 10 at Night. <HI>The Lord's Name be praised, from the rising up of the Sun unto the go∣ing down of the same.</HI> Amen and Amen.</P>

<P><HI>Monday, October</HI> 27. Preached this Morning at <HI>Milford,</HI> and I think with as much Clearness, Free∣dom and Power as I have for a long Season. The Presence of God was much in the Assembly, which was large: Many Ministers were present, &amp; they could not help glorifying God much on my Behalf. Dear Mr. <HI>Mills</HI> who came again to meet me this Morning, was much affected, and as I was riding out of Town a godly Gentleman met me, and with Tears in his Eyes, at length out of the Abundance of his Heart said, I never saw God's Presence in the Sanc∣ctuary on this wise before; I have experienced the Words you spoke, but never heard them so well cleared up, nor felt them so powerfully set home upon my Soul: It has been a blessed Time to my Soul. Or Words to that Effect. In the Afternoon I preached at <HI>Stratford,</HI> 4 miles from <HI>Milford,</HI> but was not so much assisted as in the Morning. Both Places, especially the la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter I found were ill reported of for their leaning too much towards <HI>Arminian</HI> Principles. <HI>O Lord, convince them of the Rottenness of such a Foundation, and bring them to know the Truth as it is in Jesus.</HI></P>

Preach'd in the Morning to a considerable Congregation, and found my self assisted very much in Prayer after Sermon; I scarce knew how to leave off. In the Afternoon at <HI>Norwalk,</HI> 12 miles from <HI>Fairfield,</HI> I was restrained much both in Prayer and Preaching. It rained much, so that we had not a large Congre∣gation; However, some say I observed were af∣fected.

<P><HI>Wednesday, Octob.</HI> 29. Came hither last Night in Safety, tho' it was very dark and rainy. Was vi∣sited with a great inward Trial, so that I was pained to the Heart. Was somewhat dejected before I went out of my Lodgings, and somewhat distressed for a Text after I got up into the Pulpit. But the Lord at length directed me to one, but I looked for no Power or Success, being very low by my last Night's Trial; notwithstanding, before I had preach'd half an Hour, the blessed Spirit began to move on the Hearers Hearts in a very awful manner. Young, and especially many old People were sur∣prizingly affected, so that I tho't they would have cried out. At Dinner the Spirit of the Lord came upon me again, and enabled me to speak with such Vigour against sending unconverted Persons into the Ministry, that two Ministers, with Tears in their Eyes, publickly confessed, they had laid Hands on young
<PB N="94" REF="004848_0048_100E01EEB5615C08"/>
Men without so much as asking them, <HI>Whether they were born again of God or not?</HI> After Dinner, find∣ing my Heart much enlarged, I prayed, and with such Power, that most in the Room were put under Concern. And one old Minister was so deeply con∣victed, that calling Mr. <HI>Noble</HI> and me out, with great difficulty (because of his weeping) He desired our Prayers. <HI>For,</HI> says he, <HI>I have been a Scholar, and have preached the Doctrines of Grace for a long Time, but I believe I never have felt the Power of them in my own Soul.</HI> O that all unconverted Mi∣nisters were bro't to make the same Confession. I was much affected with his Ingenuity, and after having by Prayer earnestly recommended him to God, I took Horse, rejoicing exceedingly in Spi∣rit, to see how our Lord was getting himself the Victory in a Place where Mr. <HI>Davenport,</HI> a Native of <HI>Stanford,</HI> and dear Minister of the blessed Jesus, had been slighted &amp; despised. <HI>A Prophet is not without Honour, save in his own Country &amp; his Father's House.</HI></P>
<P>But here I think it proper to set up my <HI>Ebenezer,</HI> and before I enter into the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> to give God Thanks for sending me into <HI>New-Eng∣land.</HI> I have now had an Opportunity of seeing the greatest and the most populous Parts of it, &amp; take all together, it certainly on many Accounts exceeds all other Provinces in <HI>America,</HI> &amp; for the Establish∣ment of Religion, perhaps all other Parts of the World. Never surely was so large a Spot of Ground setled in such a Manner, in so short a Space as one hun∣dred Years. The Towns thro' <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and Eastward towards <HI>York,</HI> in the Province of the <HI>Mas∣sachusetts-Bay,</HI> near the River Side are large, and well peopled, and exceeding pleasant to travel thro'.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="004848_0048_100E01EEB5615C08"/>
Every five or ten miles you have a Meeting-House, and I believe there's no such Thing as a Pluralist or non-resident Minister in both Provinces. Many, nay perhaps most that preach, I fear, do not expe∣rimentally know Christ, yet I cannot see much worldly Advantage to tempt them to take upon them the sacred Function. Few Country-Ministers as I have been informed, have sufficient allowed them in Money to maintain a Family. God has remarkably in sundry Times, &amp; in divers manners, poured out his Spirit in several Parts of both Provinces, &amp; it often re∣freshes my Soul, to hear of the Faith of the good Fore∣fathers who first setled in these Parts; notwithstand∣ing they had their Foibles, surely they were a Set of righteous Men: They certainly followed our Lord's Rule, <HI>sought first the Kingdom of God and his Righ∣teousness,</HI> and behold all other Things God added unto them: Their Seed are now blessed in temporal Things especially, &amp; notwithstanding the rising Ge∣neration seem to be setled on their Lees, yet I be∣lieve the <HI>Lord hath left more than seven thousand who have not bowed their Knee to Baal.</HI> The Ministers and People of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> seemed to be more sim∣ple and serious than those that live near <HI>Boston,</HI> espe∣cially in those Parts where I went. But I think the Ministers preaching almost universally by Notes, is a certain mark they have in a great measure lost the old Spirit of Preaching.—For tho' all are not to be condemned that use Notes, yet it is a sad Symp∣tom of the Decay of vital Religion, when reading Sermons becomes fashionable, where <HI>extempore</HI> preaching did once almost universally prevail: When the Spirit of Prayer began to be lost, then Forms of Prayer were invented, and I believe the same
<PB N="96" REF="004848_0049_100E01F2851A6968"/>
Observation will hold good as to preaching. As for the Universities I believe it may be said, <HI>Their Light is now become Darkness,</HI>—<HI>Darkness that may be felt;</HI> and is complained of by the most godly Mini∣sters. I pray God those Fountains may be purifi∣ed, and send forth pure Streams to water the City of our God. The Church of <HI>England</HI> is at a very low Ebb, and as far as I can find, had People kept their primitive Purity, it would scarce have got foot∣ing in <HI>New-England.</HI> I have many Evidences to prove that most of the Churches have been first set up by immoral Men, and such as would not submit to the Discipline of their Congregations, or were corrupt in the Faith.—But I will say no more a∣bout the poor Church of <HI>England.</HI>—Most of her Sons, whither Ministers or People, I fear hate to be reformed. As for the civil Government of <HI>New-England,</HI> it seems to be well regulated, and I think at opening all their Courts, either the Judge or a Minister begins with a Prayer. Family Wor∣ship is I believe generally kept up. The Negroes I think are better used in respect both to Soul and Body, than in any other Province I have yet seen. In short, I like <HI>New-England</HI> exceeding well, and when a Spirit of Reformation revives, it certainly will prevail more than in other Places, because they are more simple in their Worship, less corrupt in their Principles, and consequently more easily brought over to the Form of sound Words, into which so many of their pious Ancestors were delivered. <HI>Send forth, O Lord, thy Light and thy Truth, and for thy infinite Mercies Sake, shew thou hast a peculiar Delight in these habitable Parts of the Earth.</HI> Amen, Lord Jesus, AMEN.</P>
