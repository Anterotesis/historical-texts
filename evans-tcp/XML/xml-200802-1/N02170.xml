<Q><BIBL>II. SAMUEL XXIII.3, 4.</BIBL>
<P>The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God:</P>
<P>And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.</P></Q>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE last Words of great &amp; good Men, are accounted Worthy of an attentive observation, and affectionate Remembrance. The Words now read are call'd the last Words of <HI>David, i. e.</HI> say Expositors, Some of the last which he spake by the Spirit of God, assisting and directing him in an Extraordinary Manner; or such as he often repeated to his last breath, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. Pool, Mr. Henry</NOTE> But indeed a greater than
<PB N="2" REF="002583_0005_0FE5D42F1AB02740"/>
<HI>David</HI> is here: He was a Royal Prophet, and spake as inspir'd by the <HI>Holy Ghost.</HI> v.2. <HI>The Spirit of the Lord spake by me, and his Word was in my Tongue.</HI> The Spirit of God suggested these words to him, and govern'd him in the delivery of them: 2 Pet. 1.21. <HI>For the Prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</HI> They were under the unerring guidance of this Divine Person as to the Matter and Words of the holy Scriptures; so that what they thus spake must be receiv'd not as the <HI>Word of Man,</HI> but as it is in truth, the <HI>Word of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>AND here I may observe by the way, That inas∣much as it follows in the Words of my Text, The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me—Some suppose here's an intimation of the Three glo∣rious Persons in the Trinity; The Father, the GOD of Israel, the Son, the Rock of Israel, and the Holy Spirit, proceeding from the Father and the Son, who spake by the <HI>Prophets,</HI> and particularly <HI>by the Mouth of his servant David.</HI> Whether this be the Truth of this Place or no, It is certainly a funda∣mental Article of our holy Religion, to be firmly believ'd because GOD hath reveal'd it. 1 Joh 5.7. <HI>For there are Three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these Three are One.</HI></P>
<P>IN the Words of my Text, We may observe, 1. <HI>The Persons speaking</HI>: The GOD of Israel said. GOD is in a peculiar Manner the GOD of his Israel, their Covenant GOD. The Rock of Israel; <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by whom, as we have already hinted, some understand the Son of GOD, who is One with his
<PB N="3" REF="002583_0006_0FE5D43639168468"/>
Eternal Father in the Divine Essence, and is the Rock on whom the Church is built, the Strength and Support, Defence and Safety of his People. 2. We may observe, <HI>to, or of whom —. To me,</HI> i. e. To <HI>David,</HI> by way of <HI>Precept</HI>; or <HI>of me,</HI> i. e. of him, or his House, by way of Prediction and <HI>Promise.</HI> 3. <HI>What is said.</HI> He that ruleth over Men —. Some understand these Words as a Prophecy, and read them after this manner, There shall be a Ruler over Men, or among Men, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Messiah,</HI> <Q>who tho' he be the invisible GOD, yet shall visibly ap∣pear &amp; Rule among Men.</Q> Thus the words con∣tain a Prophecy of our <HI>Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> the Son of <HI>David,</HI> and of his Kingdom, who is in an appro∣priate Sense, <HI>the Just One,</HI> and being filled with the Spirit, deserved this Character in Perfection, both respecting his Personal Qualifications, and the Bles∣sed Fruits of his Reign; which are truly more Plea∣sant and of greater and more extensive Usefulness than the Light or Rain of Heaven. And thus it may be suppos'd that <HI>David</HI> reflecting on the Ca∣lamities already brought on his House, and fore∣seeing by the Spirit, that the Glory of it would still further decay and fade as a Leaf; refresheth him∣self with the Consideration of the Coming of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> his Son and Successor, and his Lord, in whose most righteous &amp; happy Government, not his Family and People only; but even the whole World were to be Blessed. And this Sense may seem to be favoured by what immediately follows, Ver. 5. <HI>Altho' my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me an Everlasting Covenant, ordered in all things and sure: for this is all my salvation, and all
<PB N="4" REF="002583_0007_0FE5D4384011D280"/>
my desire, altho' he make it not to grow.</HI> But then, others understand these Words as spoken to <HI>David</HI> by way of Precept, <Q>and so they are a Declaration of the Duty of Kings, particularly of <HI>Solomon</HI> his Son and of his Successors the Kings of Israel, for whose Instruction he gives this Rule.</Q> Our Tran∣slation favours this Interpretation. And indeed these Words contain an Excellent Description of the Duty of Civil Magistrates, of the King as Supream, and of such as are under him in place of Power. They must be Just towards Men, which in the large Sense of the Word, comprehends the whole of our Duty towards our Neighbour, according to the Place and Relation we sustain, and so includes Clemency, Mercy, and the like, which in some Cases are Jus∣tice. And then this Justice to Men must flow from an inward Principle of holy Fear towards GOD, who is the Fountain of all Power, and be regulated by it. And then, the 4th Ver. <HI>He shall be as the light of the Morning —.</HI> May be a Description of the Prospe∣rity &amp; Glory of such Rulers, and of the happy Fruits and Effects of their Administrations with respect to the People under their Government. God will be Present with such to uphold and succeed them, so that they shall come in, and go out before God's People in the Strength of the Lord, as the Sun when he goeth forth in his might; and come down upon them as the Rain, as the showers that water the Earth, <HI>Psal.</HI> 72.6. They shall be to the <HI>Moral World,</HI> what the Sun and Rain are to the <HI>Natural, Great</HI> and Extensive Blessings; and their Wise and Just Government will, by the Blessing of GOD pro∣duce Fruits no less grateful and beneficial to their
<PB N="5" REF="002583_0008_0FE5D43909FAFA38"/>
People. Now, it is with an especial regard to this Reading that I have chosen these Words; however the other, which may well enough consist with it, taking <HI>Solomon</HI> as a Type of <HI>Christ,</HI> is so noble and excellent in it self; and so profitable for us all, and particularly for Civil Rulers to M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ditate upon, that I shall not wholly omit it. In the words then we may observe these Four Doctrines.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1.</HI> GOD is the Rock of Israel. <HI>II.</HI> The Lord Je∣sus Christ hath the Supreme Government over Men by God's appointment, and his People are most happy under his holy, just, and prosperous A ministra∣tions. <HI>III.</HI> They that Rule over Men must be Just, Ruling in the Fear GOD. <HI>IV.</HI> Such Rulers shall prosper themselves by GOD's Blessing upon them, and be made great and extensive Blessings to their People.</P>
<P>DOCT. I. <HI>GOD is the Rock of Israel.</HI></P>
<P>THE Rock of Israel spake to me. This is One of the Names and Titles whereby God is pleas'd to make himself known to his People. GOD is in Scripture frequently spoken of and shadow'd forth to us under this Metaphor, in which we have some imperfect Representation of GOD's Everlasting and Unchangeable Being, whose Name is JEHOVAH, and I AM THAT I AM; of his invinsible Power; of the Stability &amp; Firmness of his Counsels, Promi∣ses and Providential Dispensations in the World. Deut. 32, 4. <HI>He is the Rock—.</HI> This Title is gi∣ven him about Six times in this Chapter. And then,
<PB N="6" REF="002583_0009_0FE5D439CE5A7810"/>
He is the Rock of Israel, of his Covenant-People. His Ancient People call him <HI>their Rock, v.</HI>31. GOD is the Strength of Israel. their Defence and Strong Tower, in whom alone they have a sure Place of Re∣fuge when pursued with threatning Evils. If it be demanded how that GOD who is a Consuming Fire to Sinners, becomes a Rock of safety &amp; refreshment to any of the Sinful Children of fallen Adam, It must be said, That the Eternal Son of GOD, who is the Great GOD our Saviour, was in the fulness of Time <HI>sent forth made of a Woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law</HI> —: He is God-Man Mediator, and in Him GOD is the Rock of Salvation to his People. He is in Scripture call'd a Rock, 1 Cor. 10.4. — <HI>That Rock was Christ.</HI> The Son of GOD was prefigur'd by the Rock mention'd, <HI>Exod.</HI> 17.6. which being smitten gave forth waters in abundance, which followed the Israelites in their Marches thrô the dry &amp; bar∣ren Wilderness: For thus the Son of GOD in our Nature, having been smitten by GOD, when he was made a Curse for his People, became a Fountain Open'd in the Merit of his Obedience, and in the abundant Effusions of His Spirit, whose Graces and Comforts are as Streams and Rivers of living Wa∣ters for the comfortable supply &amp; refreshment of his People, <HI>Job.</HI> 7.37—39. Again, Our Lord Jesus is laid in Zion — <HI>a tryed Stone,</HI> a precious Corner∣Stone, a sure Foundation, <HI>Isai.</HI> 28.16. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 6.7. On him, God's Spiritual House the Church is built, and by him the several parts are united &amp; supported. The Lord Jesus Christ as he is reveal'd in his Word, and declar'd to be the Christ, the Son of the living
<PB N="7" REF="002583_0010_0FE5D43B54ACA210"/>
GOD, <HI>is the Rock on which the Church is built,</HI> and therefore the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against it, <HI>Matth</HI> 16.17, 18. Again, The Son of GOD is unto his People as the <HI>Shadow of a great Rock in a weary Land,</HI> Isai. 32 2. If these and the foregoing words refer to <HI>Hezekiah</HI>; yet they are supposed by good Expositors to look thrô him to Christ the great Antitype, who affords his People a cool and most refreshing Shade under which they may sit with great delight, being defended from the scorching heat of GOD's wrath, from the Curse of the fiery Law, and from all those Calamities which their Sins have deserved In a Word, He is the Fortress and Strong tower to which they may fly for Refuge to lay hold on the hope set before them, when pursued by Revenging Justice, and in which they may be safe from all their Enemies.</P>
<P>USE. LET what hath been said <HI>Excite and En∣courage perishing Sinners to fly to GOD in CHRlST, as the Rock of their Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>AND thus we all are by Nature, dead in trespasses and sins, and Children of wrath. Let as then fly to GOD's Name as to our Strong Tower: Let us make that Prayer, Psal. 61.2—<HI>Lead me to the Rock that is higher than I.</HI> O make hast to Jesus Christ, and by Faith lean &amp; rest upon him alone for Salvation! <HI>He that believeth in him shall not be confounded,</HI> I Pet. 2.6. But if the Son of GOD be a stone, &amp; rock of offence to you, You will stumble &amp; fall into Eternal Perdition; and when he shall in the Great Day of his wrath fall upon you, He will grind you to powder. Let us then not be at rest, till we find rest
<PB N="8" REF="002583_0011_0FE5D43EC1CA63A8"/>
in Jesus Christ; who will Save to the Uttermost all that come to God by him; for He is a Rock, and his work is perfect. Let us build our hopes of Eternal Life upon this Rock, that so whatever Storms of temptation and trouble arise and beat upon us, our building may stand: See <HI>Mat.</HI> 7.24.-27. If we are interested in CHRIST, and vitally United to him by his Spirit dwelling in us, &amp; by a true Faith, we may then amidst all the Changes &amp; threatning Evils of this Life, rejoyce in Christ Jesus, and sing with the sweet Psalmist of Israel, 2 Sam. 22.47. <HI>The Lord Liveth, and blessed be my Rock; and Exalted be the God of the rock of my Salvation.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. LET <HI>the Enemies of God's Church and People be afraid, and desist from their wicked Enterprizes.</HI></P>
<P>IN opposing God and Christ, you run against a Rock, and can expect nothing but to be broken in pieces. We read of the <HI>Stone cut out without hands, that it smote the Image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dan. 2.34.</NOTE>. Let the Com∣binations of the Enemies of God's People be ever so strong and numerous, that word shall in the Con∣clusion be fulfill'd in them; Isai. 8.9. <HI>Associate your selves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces</HI>—.</P>
<P N="3">3. LET <HI>this People be Exhorted &amp; Encouraged to Look to, and Trust in the LORD for Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>OUR Fathers trusted in the Lord, and he delive∣red them. Let us then be encourag'd under all the dark Providences which pass over us, to Trust in the Lord, and Stay upon our God: Who is Eternal and Unchangeable in his Wisdom, Power, Goodness, Mercy &amp; Covenant-Faithfulness. Isai. 26 4. <HI>Trust ye
<PB N="9" REF="002583_0012_0FE5D441043DFFA0"/>
in the Lord for ever: for in the Lord JEHOVAH is everlasting Strength.</HI> Heb. <HI>The Rock of Ages.</HI> Tho' we are a very degenerate People, yet we may humbly Call upon the Lord, as our Covenant God He hath stretched out our Heavens, and laid the foundation of our Earth, and form d us a People for himself. It is true, we have by our great degeneracies given GOD reason to complain of us something as of his ancient People, Deut. 32.15. <HI>But Jeshurun waxed sat and kicked</HI> —, then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his Salvation. We have been in an high degree unmindful of the Rock that begat us, and forgotten God that formed us. We have provoked God to Jealousy by our hainous iniquities, and now God provokes us to anger with a foolish Nation. We must say of our Enemies, <HI>Their Rock is not as our Rock</HI>; But alas! Out Sins have in a dreadful measure separated be∣tween us and our God, and he refuseth to give us those Tokens of his gracious Presence, and to fight our battels, as formerly hath been Experienc'd, when our Enemies were numurous, and we but a few comparatively. And shall we go on to provoke the Lord by our Sins till our Rock fell us, "<HI>quit his interest in &amp; relation to us</HI>". O let us not do it? For if God leave us, our Defence and Glory are de∣parted. Let us not go from God with a perpetual backsliding; but let us Return to him by sincere Repentance; lay hold of his strength and make Peace with him. Then we might hope to see that good word fulfilled in us. Deut. 33.27. <HI>The Eternal God is thy refuge:— and be shall thrust out the Enemy from before thee, and shall, say destroy them.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="002583_0013_0FE5D4421B1862D8"/><HI>DOCT. II.</HI> THE Lord Jesus Christ hath the Su∣preme Government over Men by God's appoint∣ment, and his People are most happy under his Holy, just, &amp; Prosperous Administrations.</P>
<P>WE have already observed that some Read these Words as a Prophecy; There shall be a Ruler over Men, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and apply them to our Lord Jesus Christ the Son of <HI>David,</HI> in whom the <HI>Covenant of Royalty</HI> made with <HI>David,</HI> in which GOD promis'd, <HI>That his Throne should be as the days of Heaven,</HI> Psal. 89.29. had it's full accomplishment. Agreably, We have that Promise of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> our Lord Je∣sus Christ, Isai. 11.1-4. <HI>There shall come sorth a Rod out of the stem of Jesse: — And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the Spirit of wisdom and un∣derstanding, the spirit of counsel &amp; might, the spirit of knowledge, and the fear of the Lord: And shall make him of quick Understanding in the fear of the Lord, and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, —But with Righteousness shall be judge the poor.—</HI> And we have the happy fruits of his Government described in the same Chapter, 6-9. <HI>v.</HI> Here I would speak to a few particulars very briefly.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THE Lord Jesus Christ hath the Supreme Go∣vernment over Men by G0D's appointment.</HI> The Son of GOD is the King of Glory. He is <HI>Over all God blessed for ever,</HI> Rom. 9.5. <HI>All things were made by him,</HI> Joh. 1.3. And therefore his <HI>Govern∣ment</HI> over all Creatures, as he is GOD, <HI>is natural and necessary,</HI> for he is essentially One with the Father and the Spirit, <HI>Equal in Power &amp; Glory.</HI> But besides
<PB N="11" REF="002583_0014_0FE5D4448CAA89D8"/>
this, our Lord Jesus Christ hath a <HI>Delegated &amp; Me∣diatorial Kingdom</HI> as he is the Son of GOD Incar∣nate, the only Mediator between GOD and Man, and the Saviour of his People. Isa. 9.6, 7. <HI>Unto us a child is born—, and the Government shall be upon his shoulder: and his Name shall be called, Won∣derful, Counsellor, the mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his Government &amp; Peace there shall be no End, upon the Throne of David, and upon his Kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment &amp; with justice, from henceforth even for ever:</HI> The Zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this. Now in this respect the Messiah is GOD's King in a singular and most tran∣scendent manner, and is Exalted by GOD the Fa∣ther as the Reward of his meritorious Obedience in his Humiliation. Phil 2.8, 11. <HI>And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obe∣dient unto death, even the death of the Cross. Where∣fore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a Name which is above every Name. That at the Name of Jesus every knee should bow —</HI> Not as if we were obliged to bow our Bodies whenever the Letters and Syllables of the Name <HI>Jesus</HI> are pro∣nounced; for <HI>Joshua</HI> is call'd <HI>Jesus</HI> in <HI>Heb.</HI> 4.8. And some of the Creatures here mentioned, have no Knees to bow. It must signify therefore, that all must pay homage to the Person signified by this Name, and be in Subjection to him either freely or by constraint. This Kingdom of CHRIST of which we are now speaking is a <HI>Universal Kingdom,</HI> a Do∣minion which Ruleth over all. He is <HI>the King of Kings,</HI>—Rev. 19.16. The Son of GOD is the
<PB N="12" REF="002583_0015_0FE5D44AF2FAF2F8"/>
Supreme Ruler of Heaven and Earth: <HI>All power is given unto him in heaven and in earth,</HI> Matth. 28 I8. The holy <HI>Angels are subject to him</HI>: They Worship him and stand about his Throne as ministring Spi∣rits, <HI>Heb.</HI> 1.6. <HI>Isa.</HI> 6.1, 2. The <HI>Devils are subjected</HI> by Conquest: Col. 2.15. <HI>Having spoiled principali∣ties &amp; powers,</HI>—<HI>triumphing over them</HI>—. Our glorious Lord, who is the Seed of the Woman, hath bruised the Serpent's Head. Again, The <HI>whole World of Mankind</HI> is under the Government of CHRIST. The Father hath given him <HI>Power over all flesh,</HI> Joh. 17.2. Whether they be Elect or Re∣probate, Good or Bad, our Lord Jesus is in a large sense King over them all. He <HI>Rules in the midst of his Enemies,</HI> Psal. 110.2. He hath a Rod of Iron to dash in pieces his implacable Enemies, and must sit at God's Right Hand, till all of them <HI>are made his footstool,</HI> ver. 1. The <HI>Shields of the Earth</HI> belong to him, even <HI>all Rulers,</HI> who ought by their Office to be as Shields to protect and defend their People from Injuries. All Governments are under him, and be∣long to him, who is <HI>the blessed and only Potentate,</HI>—I Tim. 6.15. It is owing to his good Providence that there's any good Order and civil Peace among sinful Men, and that some heathen Rulers have been Benefactors to their People. GOD the Son, who is called <HI>the Wisdom of God,</HI> Luk. 11.49. speaks, Prov. 8.15. <HI>By me Kings reign, and Princes decree justice.</HI> When ever they are enabled to Execute Justice, this is from CHRIST, tho' the Heathen know him not. But then, our Lord is in a peculiar sense, <HI>the King of his Church &amp; People,</HI> whom he Governs by his Word and Spirit Psal. 2.6.—<HI>I set my King
<PB N="13" REF="002583_0016_0FE5D44C5DAFFDA8"/>
on my holy hill of Zion.</HI> And He hath a peculiar Respect to their Welfare in the Exercise of his Go∣vernment, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.22. And hath put all things un∣der his feet, and gave him to be <HI>the Head over all things to the Church.</HI> And here we may take notice of Christ's visible and invisible Kingdom, as the Church falls under a two-fold consideration in Scrip∣ture. The <HI>Visible Church</HI> is in Scripture call'd the <HI>Kingdom of Heaven,</HI> Mat. 25.1. which consists of those that <HI>Openly profess subjection to Christ &amp; his Laws, and of their Seed.</HI> CHRIST is the Lord of his own House, the Church, and hath in his Word, which is his Rod or Scepter, given those Laws and Ordi∣nances by which he will have it govern'd; to which are annexed Promises &amp; Threatnings, as Sanctions. The Gospel is the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The Lord is our Law-giver, the Lord is our King, <HI>Isai.</HI> 33.22. Accordingly, He charged his <HI>Apostles,</HI> and their <HI>Suc∣cessors</HI> to the End of the World, <HI>To teach his subjects to observe whatsoever he had commanded,</HI> and then <HI>promiseth them his gracious Presence always even unto the End of the World,</HI> Mat 28.19, 20. His Will re∣vealed in his Word is the Rule and Measure of our Obedience; from which nothing may be taken, to which nothing may be added, if we would avoid that dreadful Curse, <HI>Rev.</HI> 22.18, 19. Again, Our Lord in the Execution of his Kingly Office, hath <HI>appointed Officers</HI> in his Church to feed and rule his People in his Name, and according to his Word, <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.11, 12, whose power is not <HI>lordly,</HI> but stewardly and <HI>mini∣sterial</HI> under Christ, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5.3. Now, these things belong to Christs visible Kingdom upon Earth, in which he governs his People by his own Laws, Offi∣cers
<PB N="14" REF="002583_0017_0FE5D44D28127FC8"/>
Censures, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And therefore it is most intolle∣rable Presumption for any to require the Church and People of GOD to observe the Traditions of Men, and so to do what in them lies to make void Christ's Law. As Christ says to the Pharisees, <HI>Mat.</HI> 15.6. — Thus have ye made the Commandment of God of none effect by your tradition: Or unlorded it, as the word signifies. This is indeed to snatch at a flower of Christ's Crown, how light soever Men may make of it; and when he comes to Judgment, will be found <HI>Crimen laesae Majestatis,</HI> High Treason against the King of Heaven. Such is the Usurpati∣on of <HI>Antichrist, who Opposeth and Exalteth himself above all that is called God,</HI>— Whom the Lord shall <HI>Consume</HI> with the <HI>Spirit of his Mouth,</HI> and shall <HI>De∣stroy with the brightness of his coming,</HI> 2 Thes. 2.4—8. Surely then, it much concerns the subjects of Christ, as they wou'd approve themselves loyal to him, and consult their own safety, to stand a great way off from <HI>Roman Antichristian,</HI> in their Principles and Practices, left when she shall fall, (as.we are sure she shall and rise no more, <HI>Rev.</HI> 18.2, 21.) they be terribly shaken: Rev. 18.4. — <HI>Come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</HI></P>
<P>BUT to proceed, the things but now mention'd belong to the visible dispensation of Christ's King∣dom upon Earth, under which Multitudes are com∣prehended that are not savingly Converted. But then, there are a Number whom GOD hath <HI>chosen in Christ, before the foundation of the World, that they should be holy, and without blame before him in love,</HI>— Eph. 1.4. who are in all Ages effectually Call'd by

the Holy Spirit, and made willing in the Day of God's power. Now of these it may be said that the <HI>Kingdom of God is within them,</HI> Luk 17.21 When this glorious King rides forth prosperously on the Word of Truth, He subdues his Elect, who were E∣nemies in their Minds to the obedience of Faith, ac∣cording to the working of his mighty power. These Experience the <HI>Renewing of the holy Ghost,</HI> Tit. 3.6. They are <HI>born again, from above, born of water &amp; of the Spirit,</HI> and so enter into the Kingdom of GOD, <HI>Job.</HI> 3.3, 5 There's a Saving &amp; Supernatual Change wrought on all the powers of their Souls, whereby they are deliver'd from the power of darkness, and translated into the Kingdom of GOD's dear Son. Their Understanding is Enlightned, their Wills, Re∣newed, and they are enabled from their hearts to Receive Jesus Christ as their Prince &amp; Saviour, and to submit to him; saying with them, Isai. 26.13. <HI>O Lord our God, other lords besides thee have had do∣minion over us: but by thee only will we make men∣tion of thy Name.</HI> The Lord Jesus Christ Rules in their hearts by his Spirit dwelling in them, and <HI>causeth them to walk in his statutes and keep his judg∣ments</HI>—,Ezek 36.27. And inasmuch as by his Grace they come up to the Terms of the New Cove∣nant, He gives them a sure title to all the Privileges and Immunities, Blessings &amp; Benefits of the <HI>Gospel Charter</HI>; such as Justification, Adoption, support under Temptations &amp; Afflictions, Victory over all Enemies, the Consolations of the Spirit, Perseverance in Grace, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> To which I may add, The Protection and Provision of his good Providence, respecting their outward Man. Again, Such are the Rest of

their departed Spirits in the Paradice of God, their glorious Resurrection, when their vile Body shall be changed &amp; fashion'd like to Christ's glorious Body; and they shall obtain Salvation with Eternal Glory. For when the Son of Man, to whom all Judgment is committed, shall come in his glory, and all the holy Angels with him; when he shall be <HI>Revealed in flaming Fire,</HI> — taking Vengeance of those that know not God and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: Then will he <HI>appear to their Sal∣vation,</HI> Mat. 25.2 Thes. 1.7, 8, 9. Heb. 9.27.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>OUR Lord Jesus Christ is most Holy &amp; Righ∣teous in all the Administrations of his Government.</HI> He is in Scripture often call'd the Just Righteous One, <HI>Isa.</HI> 53.11. Acts 3.14.— <HI>The Holy One, and the Just.</HI> The Man Christ Jesus was anointed with the Gifts &amp; Graces of the Spirit in an Extraordinary manner. GOD giveth not the Spirit by measure to him. In a particular manner, He was most emi∣nent for his holy Fear of GOD, and Justice to Men. Yea so perfect and excellent was the Obedience of this Divine Person in our Nature, that he is <HI>of God made unto his people righteousness.</HI> He is <HI>Jehovah our Rightousness,</HI> Jer. 23.6. And as to what con∣cerns his Government, of which we are now speak∣ing, it must be said unto him, Psal. 45.6, 7.—<HI>O God the Scepter of thy Kingdom is a right Scepter. Thou lovest Righteousness, and hatest wickedness—.</HI> The Son of GOD is the true <HI>Melchisedeck,</HI> the <HI>King of Righteousness</HI>; and in this respect is the Man after God's own heart in a more Exalted sense than <HI>David</HI> ever was. Isai. 11.5. <HI>And Righteousness shall be the girdle of his wins.</HI> — <HI>q. d.</HI> <Q>It shall adorn him, and
<PB N="17" REF="002583_0020_0FE5D458334F6BF8"/>
be the Glory of his Government; and it shall con∣stantly cleave to him in all his administrations</Q><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr.<HI>Pool</HI> in Lcc.</NOTE>. The Laws of Christ are holy and righteous altoge∣ther, and so are all his Administrations. The Laws of his Kingdom are every way suited to make his Subjects good &amp; happy, &amp; he is most just &amp; impartial in the Execution of them. <HI>Shall not the judge of all the Earth do right?</HI> most certainly he will. Being God &amp; Man in One Person, he cannot Err. Even when the Son of GOD goeth forth against his Ene∣mies it is to Execute Judgment. Rev. 19, 11.— <HI>In righteousness be doth judge and make War.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>HIS Obedient People are most happy under his Righteous &amp; Prosperous Government.</HI> He shall be as <HI>the light of the morning—, as the tender grass springing out of the Earth by clear shining after Rain.</HI> Apply these Metaphors to Jesus Christ, who is the <HI>Light of the World,</HI> that <HI>great Light</HI> which makes and rules the <HI>Gospel Day,</HI> and they are perfectly out-done. The <HI>Sun</HI> in the <HI>Firmament</HI> in all it's Light and Glory, is but a dark shadow of this <HI>Sun of Righteousness</HI> who is Light, and in whom there is no Darkness at all, the Brightness of the Father's Glory, and the Fountain of all Divine Knowledge, Life &amp; Comfort. When he arose <HI>the Day spring from on high, visited his People, to give light to them that sat in darkness, and in the shadow of death,</HI> Luk. 1.78, 9. We have the flourishing happy State of the Gospel∣Church described, Isa. 60.19. <HI>The Sun shall be no more thy light by day,—but the Lord shall be un∣to thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory.</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="002583_0021_0FE5D41E8C5ADF50"/>
When the Son of God is pleas'd to cause his Face to shine upon his People, then their <HI>Righteousness goet forth as brightness, and their Salvation as a lamp that burneth.</HI> What are the precious Fruits brought forth by the Sun? surely not comparable to the Fruits of Christ's Kingdom, which is <HI>Righteous∣ness, and Peace, &amp; Joy in the Holy Ghost.</HI> We read, Psal. 84.11. For the Lord God is a <HI>Sun,</HI>—the Lord <HI>will give grace and glory: no good thing will be with∣hold from them that walk uprightly.</HI> And thus we have the blessed Influences of Christ's Government compared to the Rain, Psal. 72.6, 7. <HI>He shall come down like Rain,—as showers that water the Earth—,In his days shall the Righteous flourish. By his Doctrine which drops as the Rain,</HI> and by the sweet and benign <HI>Influences of his Spirit,</HI> he causeth his People to abound in the peaceable Fruits of Righte∣ousness. We have the Blessings of Christ's Kingdom described, Isa. 32.1. <HI>Behold a King shall reign in Righteousness,—a man shall be—as rivers of water in a dry place.</HI> ver. I5. Until the <HI>Spirit be poured out upon us from on high, and the wilderness be a fruitful Field. ver.</HI> 17. The Work of Righteousness shall be Peace, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Thus Isa 44.3, 4. <HI>I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and flouds upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring: And they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the water courses.</HI> As the Earth is enriched with the River of God which is full of Water; so our Lord by pouring out his Spi∣rit in plentiful measures, Creates a River the Streams whereof makes glad the City of God; and his Chur∣ches are as fruitful Fields, as watered Gardens

<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>I wou'd improve this Doctrine in a Word of <HI>Ex∣hortation.</HI> And that particularly directed,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>TO our Honoured Rulers with all Humility. Give Glory to the Son of God by submitting to his Government, and by employing all your Power for the Advancement of his Kingdom.</HI> GOD speaks to Ru∣lers whether Supream, or Subordinate, in their limi∣ted Dominions; Psal. 2.12. <HI>Kiss the Son lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way—.</HI> You must bow down and adore this glorious King, and Submit to his Government. This you are oblig'd to as much as the meanest under your Government; and the rather because in his Governing Providence he hath set you over his People. You must yield an hearty Obedience to the Laws of CHRIST's Kingdom in the Exercise of Faith, Repentance and New Obedi∣ence; and by a profess'd Subjection to the Govern∣ment &amp; Ordinances he hath appointed in his Church. Particularly, you should look to it, that when the People of God are call'd to sit with the King at his Table, your Seat be not empty.</P>
<P>INDEED it doth not pertain to you to Admi∣nister the Ordinances of Christ's House; however it is your Province to be as <HI>Guardian Angels</HI> round the Church and People of GOD, to defend them in their Religious as well as Civil Privileges, that they may lead quiet and peaceable Lives in all godliness and honesty. Furthermore, It ought to be your Care and Endeavour to Enlarge the Kingdom of the
<PB N="20" REF="002583_0023_0FE5D45A684FA420"/>
Great GOD our Saviour, by taking proper Methods to Gospelize the <HI>dark Corners of this Land</HI>; and to spread the Savour of the Knowlege of CHRIST among the <HI>Aboriginal Natives,</HI> that they who dwell in the Wilderness may bow before him. If you do thus fall in with GOD's great design of Glorifying his Son JESUS CHRIST, he will Honor you; for in so doing you Honor GOD himself, and the Lord saith, — <HI>Them that Honour me, I will Honour</HI>—, 1 Sam 2.30.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>I wou'd beseech my Reverend Fathers &amp; Bre∣thren in the Ministry to suffer the Word of Exhorta∣tation. Use your best Endeavours to Promote the Interests of CHRIST's Kingdom.</HI> You are by your Office in an especial manner obliged to seek the Prosperity of Christ's Kingdom upon Earth. Permit me then, tho' most unworthy, to suggest a few things very briefly. CHRIST's Kingdom is not of this World, and consequently, our Work is Spiritual, and lies principally with the Souls of Men, about their Eternal State. The great and important Er∣rand upon which the Son of GOD sends you, is <HI>to turn Sinners from Darkness to Light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of Sins, and Inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith in him,</HI> Acts 26.18. As also to build up his obedient Subjects and followers on their most holy Faith. Now for this End, we must. Preach the <HI>Word of the Kingdom,</HI> and not shun to declare the whole Counsel of God. We must Preach not our selves, but CHRIST JESUS the Lord. The great Scope and Design of our Preaching must be to Glorify GOD, by winning Souls unto
<PB N="21" REF="002583_0024_0FE5D45EF8BB02A0"/>
CHRIST, and advancing his Kingdom more &amp; more in the hearts of his People. We must therefore de∣termine, as the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> did, I <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.2. Not to know any thing save Jesus Christ, and him crucified. Jesus Christ in his Natures, Divine &amp; Humane, in the Mysterious &amp; wonderful Constitution of his Person, in his Offices, and in the inestimable benefits of his Kingdom; especially in that Great &amp; Comprehen∣sive One, the <HI>sending his Holy Spirit</HI>; must be the great subject of our Preaching. Yea, whatever sub∣ject we insist upon, as we ought to Explain &amp; Enforce the great duties of the Moral Law, we must speak the Truth as it is in JESUS; for, as a Learned Divine Observes, <Q>Christ Jesus the Lord is the Sum and Center of all revealed Truth; neither is any thing to be preached unto Men, as an object of their faith, or necessary element of their Salvation, which doth not some way or other, either meet in him, or refer unto him.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Edw. Reynolds.</NOTE>. We must declare unto Men the absolute Necessity of their being United to Christ, by his Spirit dwelling in them, and by a living Faith, that so they may be justifyed thrô his per∣fect Righteousness imputed to them; of their being Created in Christ Jesus unto good Works, and of their living by the faith of the Son of God, if they would serve God acceptably in this World, and Prepare for his heavenly Kingdom.</P>
<P>AND then, if we wou'd approve our selves loyal and faithful to Jesus Christ, we must take Care to Teach his People to Observe <HI>whatsoever He hath Commanded</HI>; doing our utmost in our Places that his
<PB N="22" REF="002583_0025_0FE5D45FC3E6D338"/>
Worship &amp; Ordinances may be kept Pure &amp; Entire according to Scripture-pattern; for indeed all Un∣scriptural additions to the Worship of God, are Cor∣ruptions of it; agreeably we have that threatning, Isai. 29.13, 14.— <HI>Their fear towards me is taught by the precepts of Men: Therefore behold, I will pro∣ceed to do a marvellous work among this people:</HI> — <HI>for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish</HI> —. The Word of GOD must be our Rule &amp; Directory respecting Doctrine, Discipline &amp; Worship. We must take Care to maintain a godly Discipline in the Churches of Christ, observing that Word, Jer. 15.9. — <HI>If thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shall be as my mouth: let them return unto thee, but return not thou unto them.</HI> In a word, We must be <HI>Ensamples to the Flock</HI> over which the Holy Ghost hath made us Overseers, going before God's People, in an holy, humble, blameless, fruitful Conversation, being our selves Conformed to the Image and Exam∣ple of our glorious Lord. 1 Tim. 4.12. — <HI>Be thou en Example of the Believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.</HI> We are in an especial manner obliged to take heed we be not conformed to this World in its evil Customs and cor∣rupt Practices; but that we be transform'd by the Renewing of our Minds, that we may prove what is that good, and acceptable &amp; perfect Will of God. That word of our Lord is seasonable for us, Rev. 16.15. <HI>Behold, I come as a Thief, Blessed is he that watch∣eth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.</HI></P>
<P>I would here ask leave further to mention a few things by way of <HI>humble Inquiry.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="002583_0026_0FE5D46087370FA8"/><HI>IS it not needful that the Word of Christ,</HI> which is the Rod of his Strength whereby he subdues those that were Enemies, and then Rules them as his willing People, <HI>Should be Publickly Read in our Churches?</HI> I suppose it will be readily granted that Reading the Scriptures is a <HI>part of Religious Worship</HI>; and doth not GOD require that we should own Him as our Law-giver, by making this <HI>a part of Publick Worship?</HI> Is not this an <HI>Ordinance</HI> by which, to∣gether with <HI>Preaching,</HI> this glorious Light of the Gospel should be held up &amp; held out in the Churches which are compar'd to golden Candlesticks? The Teachers Endeavouring, as there may be need of it, to Cause the People to Understand the Reading, <HI>Deut.</HI> 31.11. <HI>Act.</HI> 15.21. <HI>Col.</HI> 4.16.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>ARE these Churches sufficiently furnis'd with Officers to attend the weighty Services of feed∣ing, Ruling and Watching over the Flocks?</HI> When as there is but <HI>One Elder</HI> in by far the greatest part of them. Is not the Work too heavy for One Man? And are there not some Cases in which it will be very difficult if not impracticable for the Church to act according to our Constitution, as when the Pastor is personally Engag'd in a Controversy with any of the Brethren? It was the declar'd judgment of these Churches, as appears by the <HI>Platform,</HI> that there are <HI>Officers</HI> belonging to the <HI>Eldership,</HI> who are to attend the Work of <HI>Spiritual Rule</HI> in the Church, together with the Pastors; <HI>Tho' they do not Labour in the Word &amp; Doctrine.</HI> Now our Fore-Fathers were holy Men, and gave themselves very much to the Study of these Things. However there is room
<PB N="24" REF="002583_0027_0FE59B15531FDFC0"/>
for an Appeal. <HI>Neverthless, What saith the Scrip∣ture? Rom.</HI> 12 7, 8 9. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.17. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.28.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>OUGHT there not to be some further Care taken of the Children of the Covenant, in the Ex∣ercise of the holy Watch &amp; Discipline of these Churches?</HI> We have been seeking to GOD to pour out His Spirit upon the Rising Generation. What is further to be done? Might not a general Agreement for <HI>Pastoral Visits,</HI> by the Blessing of God, serve this, and other good Purposes in a Day of Temptation and Degeneracy.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>DOTH not the Institution of the Office of a Deacon,</HI> as a standing Office in the Church, ne∣cessarily suppose that the Head of the Church, who said, the Poor ye have always with you, requires his Churches to declare their profess'd Subjection to his Gospel, by <HI>this particular Expression of Love,</HI> the <HI>Charitable best wing Alms on his poor Members?</HI> And is it not required that the Deacons should be so∣lemnly <HI>separated to their Work by Prayer with the laying on of Hands?</HI> Acts 6. Phil. 1.1.</P>
<P>DOTH not GOD in his Word and by his Pro∣vidence call aloud to these Churches <HI>to be Zealous and Repent, and do their First Works?</HI> Is it not high time for us to Inquire into the ground of the Contro∣versy between GOD and us, in that his Spirit is so far withdrawn from us; and to consider what is in∣cumbent upon us in a way of Duty, that GOD may draw nigh to us in a way of Grace and Favour, and Revive his Work among us—. That the <HI>Son of GOD may continue to walk in the midst of the Gol∣den Candlesticks, and to hold the Stars in his Right Hand.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="002583_0028_0FE5D461E8157980"/>I speak these things in weakness and fear, under the sense of my great Defects in the Work of the Ministry, upon the account of which I am unworthy to be call'd a Minister of CHRIST.</P>
<P N="3">3. LET this Word of Exhortation be directed to the <HI>Body of this People, Be persuaded to submit to Christs Righteous &amp; Equal Scepter, and to ap∣prove your selves his dutiful Subjects and obedient People.</HI> We are highly favour'd in that we have the Means of Grace and Salvation. CHRIST's visible Kingdom set up among us: Psal. 144.15.— <HI>Happy is that People whose God is the Lord.</HI> The flourish∣ing of Religion among us ought therefore to lie nearest our hearts, and to be our great Aim and Endeavour in our several Capacities and Stations. In a particular manner, Heads of Families should give Glory to GOD in CHRIST, <HI>by Worshipping him in their Houses, and by Commanding their Chil∣dren and Houshold after them that they keep the way of the Lord, to do Justice &amp; Judgment:</HI> And take Care that the Laws of GOD be not accounted as a strange thing in their Houses. Then do we take the best Methods to Promote the true Prosperity of our <HI>Zion,</HI> when we zealously Endeavour as far as our influence reacheth, that the Gospel of CHRIST, which is the Word of the Kingdom, may be rightly understood, profess'd, &amp; practiced. And we are un∣der the strongest Obligations to this, because the <HI>great Errand</HI> upon which our Fore-Fathers came in∣to this Land, when an howling Wilderness, was that they might <HI>set up Christs Kingdom in the power and purity of it,</HI> where Satan the god of this World rul'd

from time immemorial; <HI>and leave their Children in the Possession of the Spiritual Blessings of it.</HI> Hear the Excellent Mr. <HI>Mitchel</HI> upon this Head, <Q>The Cause of the People of GOD in <HI>New England,</HI> is, Reli∣gion; <HI>i. e.</HI> The Profession and Practice of the Truths &amp; Rules of the Word of GOD, more par∣ticularly, Reformation of Religion —. The Erecting of CHRIST'S Kingdom in whole Socie∣ties (whereby CHRIST is seen Ruling all in an open, in a prevailing and peaceable manner,) was our Design, as is our Interest in this Country: tho' with respect to the inward and invisible Kingdom, as the Scope thereof. The publick set∣ting up of CHRIST's Kingdom, and Enjoyment of those Ordinances and Ways of His, which can only be enjoy'd in whole Societies, and that with Purity and Liberty, was our End in coming hi∣ther.— In the Church, CHRIST's Kingdom is clearly and gloriously set up, when only, and all his Institutions, both in Worship and Discipline are attended and observed in their Purity and Power, according to Scripture-Pattern, [<HI>Matth.</HI> 28.18, 20.]. This is the great Cause and Interest of GOD's People in this Country, and was the great End of their Undertaking, and hath been the great matter of their Testimony in their Synodical Acts, and other Writings publis'd to the World. Hence our great Duty is to keep and seek all the Com∣mandments of God, (I <HI>Chron.</HI> 28.8.) in that re∣spect; that is, all the Institutions and Ordinances of his House; to hold fast what we have attain'd, that is according to Scripture-Pattern therein, &amp; to come up unto what we yet want, or are defective in.</Q>

To which I may add the <HI>late Testimony</HI> of that aged Servant of God, the Memorable Dr. <HI>Increase Mather,</HI> <Q>The Principal Design upon which these Colonies were at first Planted, was to <HI>Prosess, &amp; Practice &amp; Enjoy,</HI> with undisturbed Liberty, <HI>the Holy Re∣ligion of GOD our Saviour,</HI> Exhibited in the <HI>Sacred Scriptures,</HI> and <HI>Reformed</HI> and Rescued from the <HI>Inventions</HI> and <HI>Abuses</HI> which the <HI>Man of Sin</HI> has introduced; And more particularly, to set up Churches (even of the Aboriginal Natives, as well as of English Christians) for our Lord JESUS CHRIST, that should keep themselves Loyal to to him their glorious King, in his Word, giving Law unto them, and faithfull to the Religion of the Second Commandment—.</Q> This was the great End for which our <HI>Ancestors</HI> follow'd the Lord JE∣SUS CHRIST into this part of the New World, that they might keep themselves Chast and Loyal to Him in the Profession and Practice of undefil'd Reli∣gion.

But there is now reason to take up that Lamentation, Lam 4.1. <HI>How is the gold become dim! how is the most fine gold changed!

<P>I proceed to consider the Words as they may con∣tain a Declaration of the Duty of Civil Rulers, and a Description of the happy Influence of their Govern∣ment, when they answer the Character here given.</P>
<P><HI>DOCT. III.</HI> THEy that Rule over Men must be Just, Ruling in the Fear of GOD.</P>
<P>HERE I may by the way observe something im∣plied in the Words, viz. <HI>That Civil Government is of Divine Appointment.</HI> The GOD of Israel said, he that Ruleth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now this supposeth that there is a Rule over Men which GOD hath constituted. Accordingly we have that Command, Rom. 13. 1, <HI>Let every soul be Subject to the higher Powers. For there is no Power but of God, the Powers that be, are ordained of God.</HI> v. 2. <HI>Whosoever therefore resisteth the Power, resisteth the Ordinance of God</HI> —. In∣deed this or that particular Form of Government may be of humane determination; but not Government it self: The Most High hath declar'd his Will, that there shall be a Rule over Men. Here we also see, <HI>That the management of Civil Govern∣ment is not left to the Arbitrary will &amp; pleasure of men.</HI> No! Rulers, must walk by Rule in their Ad∣ministrations, taking care that the Ruled enjoy their Rights and Properties. This they must do in the fear of GOD, who cloaths them with Authority, and
<PB N="32" REF="002583_0035_0FE5D475C407A978"/>
will call them to an account whether they have im∣proved their Power agreeable to his declared Will, and for his Glory. The principal End of Govern∣ment next to the Glory of GOD, the last End of all things, is the Good of Civil Societies &amp; Communities of Men. <Q>Let Rulers remember, that they Rule over Men, not over Beasts whom they may enslave and abuse at pleasure, but over reasonable Crea∣tures, and of the same Rank with themselves</Q><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Henry in</HI> Loc.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>THEY that Rule ever Men must be Just.</HI> The Word here us'd sometimes comprehends the whole of our Duty. It may here include their Discharge of all the duties of the Second Table ac∣cording to the Place &amp; Relations they sustain. They must take care to maintain &amp; promote Justice among Men, especially among those over whom GOD hath set them.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THEY that Rule over Men must be Examples of Justice and Righteousness in their whole behaviour.</HI> Rulers are in the Providence of GOD set upon an hill, and they must take care that their light shine before Others. Particularly, they must be Patterns and Examples to their People in a conscientious attendance on the Duties of the Second Table. Tho' they Rule over Men, yet they are under the Law of GOD as well as others, and must teach others Obe∣dience by their ready and chearful Subjection to it. There's a great force in Example, especially in the Examples of Rulers: 2 Chron. 12.1. <HI>Rehoboam forsook the law of the Lord, and all Israel with him</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="002583_0036_0FE59B12BB50B910"/>
It is a Proverbial saying, <HI>All men will conform to the King's Example</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Regis ad Exemplum —</NOTE>. When such as are in Autho∣rity do therefore set a <HI>fair Copy</HI> by their honest and good Behaviour, there will be ground to hope that their People will imitate them. Rulers then must be just to their <HI>own Character,</HI> and shew forth the <HI>Image</HI> of God <HI>in them,</HI> if they would have others duly re∣gard the <HI>Image</HI> of God which is <HI>upon them,</HI> in their high Station of Dignity and Power. They must do their Duty towards themselves, or they will not be capable of attending their Duty aright towards their People. They must by the Grace of God go∣vern their own Appetites and Passions, and Exercise a Rule over their own Spirits. Thus, they must be temperate in the use of Meats and Drinks, or they will pervert Judgment, and Expose themselves to Contempt. Prov. 31. 4, 5. <HI>It is not for Kings, O Lemuel, it is not for Kings to drink wine, nor for Princes strong drink: Left they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.</HI> If this Vice be indulg'd it will in a peculiar manner unfit Rulers to discern and execute Judgment; it will make them vile, and lay their honour in the dust; for it will bereave them of that Wisdom which causeth the face to shine, and which in an especial manner commands Respect and Reverence in Persons of a superior Character. Again, They must know how to <HI>possess their vessels in sanctifica∣tion &amp; honour, and not in the lust of uncleanness,</HI> for this is one of those Sins which especially corrupts and infatuates the Mind. Hos. 4.11. <HI>Whoredom,</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="002583_0037_0FE5D477B06FFE70"/>
and Wine—<HI>take away the heart.</HI> Accordingly we have that Dehortation given to <HI>Lemuel,</HI> that is to <HI>Solomon</HI> as Interpreters generally agree; Prov. 31.3. <HI>Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth Kings.</HI> How pernicious were the fruits of this Sin in <HI>David</HI>'s and <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Reigns; how great a Blot to those famous Kings! Again, They must <HI>Rule their own Spirits,</HI> and regulate their Anger according to the Rule of GOD's Word. Such as have the Sword of Justice put into their hands, had need be Men of a meek, sedate, &amp; calm Spirit; for the wrath of Man works not the Righteousness of God. It is true, They must be Zealous in GOD's Cause, and for their Country's Safety; but should be patient and forbearing in their own. <HI>Moses</HI>'s Meekness was one eminent Qualification that fitted him to bear the burden of his Government over a froward People. We read, Prov. 17.27.—<HI>A man of understanding is of an excellent Spirit.</HI> <Q>Or as others render it, is <HI>of a cool Spirit,</HI> calm and moderate, not easily provok'd.</Q> In a Word, They that Rule over Men must <HI>be Just &amp; Fair in their Deal∣ings,</HI> consider them in their private Capacities and Employments. And this is call'd <HI>Commutative Justice,</HI> in which there is a mutual giving and receiving of that which is each one's due, as Men are Nei'bours and Brethren. And in this respect Rulers must ob∣serve that Rule, Rom. 13.7. <HI>Render to all their dues.</HI> Ver. 8. <HI>Owe no man any thing, but to love one another.</HI> These Commands reach Men in an high Station as well as others. They must do to others, as they wou'd have them do unto them; they must not seek their own only, but also another's Wealth;
<PB N="35" REF="002583_0038_0FE5D47A9BD22D58"/>
and take heed they take no Advantage from the higher ground they stand upon, to over-reach or oppress their Brethren of low Degree. They should not endeavour to engross all Advantages to them∣selves; but declare by their Practice that they are desirous that their Nei'bours shou'd thrive and grow in their Estates also, in some Equitable Proportion. Yea, they should be <HI>Examples</HI> of <HI>Charity &amp; Bene∣ficence,</HI> being ready to give a portion to fix &amp; to se∣ven, as their Neighbour's necessity and their ability require; yea, they should be ready to deny them∣selves, if they may thereby eminently serve their poor Brethren, and put them in a way of getting an honest livelihood. Thus such as are in publick Place shou'd go before others in a Conspicuous Exam∣ple of Righteousness, that they may Call upon their People to follow them, &amp; stir them up to attend their Duty in these respects. Thus they should do their Endeavour to bring the Duties of the Second Table into Repute among their People. O there might, by the Blessing of GOD, be a great deal of Good done this way, if such as are called gods would be imitators of GOD the Just One, and followers of that which is Good. Such Examples wou'd be likely to attract the Eyes and Hearts of Men, and wou'd have an Excellent tendency to promote Justice among a People; and the setting them is a Debt which Civil Rulers owe to GOD and their Country.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THEY they that Rule over Men, must take Care that Righteous Laws be Enacted for the Main∣taining of Justice between Rulers and Ruled, and among their People.</HI> I am sensible that all in Autho∣rity
<PB N="36" REF="002583_0039_0FE5D41FF17C80B8"/>
have not the Power of making Laws betrusted with them; but then such as have the <HI>Legislative Power</HI> committed to them must use it lawfully, by taking Care that such Laws be made as are Confor∣mable to the Law of GOD, Just and Good. Such as may be a just and equal Boundary between the <HI>Prerogative</HI> of the Ruler, and the <HI>Privilege</HI> of the Ruled. Such as are suitable and sufficient to main∣tain that which is Right among their People, and to discountenance &amp; Punish all Injustice. As, open Disobedience to and Contempt of Parents, Murders, Adulteries, Thefts, Robberies, False∣Witness bear∣ing, Drunkenness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> [I shall not here particu∣larly mention those Laws which immediately relate to the First Table, tho' Justice to Men, as well as Piety towards GOD, require that the Civil Magistrate be in this respect the Keeper of both Tables.] Due Testimony must be born against such Sins, and Pro∣vision must in this way be made, that every one may enjoy his own Right and Property without mo∣lestation from the injurious Sons of Violence. As was said of Judah and Israel under <HI>Solomon</HI>'s peace∣able and happy Government; 1 Kings 4.24. <HI>Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his Vine, and under his Fig-tree.</HI> If Civil Rulers would ap∣prove themselves Just to their People, they must exert their Authority that the <HI>Wicked may not de∣vour the Man that is more Righteous than he. And that Men may not be as the Fishes of the Sea which have no Ruler over them:</HI> And for this End they must take Care that Good Laws be made to Restrain and Curb in the impetuous Lusts of those Men who are as the <HI>Horse,</HI> or as <HI>the Mule, which have no Under∣standing</HI>;—;
<PB N="37" REF="002583_0040_0FE5D47C33D73998"/>that such as have not the Fear of GOD before their Eyes, and are not awed by the Judgment to come, may be terrified by the Fear of present Punishment from the Magistrate, and so be deterr'd from executing their wicked Purposes. <HI>Distributive Justice,</HI> which consists in the Equal dis∣tribution of Rewards &amp; Punishments, by the Civil Magistrate to the People under his Government, can't be duly exercised, unless just Laws be E∣nacted as the Rule and Measure of it; for where there is no Law, there is no Transgression. It is an Eminent Act of Justice therefore in Rules to make righteous Statutes and Judgments, in which the Sanction of the Law, or the Penalty annexed to en∣force it, shall bear a due proportion to the Nature, Aggravation, and Degree of the Sin forbidden: That Men may not be emboldened to gratify their vile Lusts, because the Punishment to be inslicted is some small Fine or light Punishment, which they can bear almost without feeling it. No! Rulers must be a <HI>Terror to Evil Works,</HI> Rom. 13.3. and must make Sinners afraid of the Power, by adjusting the Punishment to the Crime, that when others <HI>hear</HI> of the Judgment Executed according to Law, <HI>they may Fear, and not do so wickedly.</HI> But after all, due Care must be taken that the Laws be <HI>put in Execution</HI> when Enacted, otherwise the Proclaiming them will be but an empty Sound, that will rather Expose a Government to Contempt, than render it terrible to hold Transgressors. And this brings me to the third particular:</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>THEY that Rule ever Men, must take Care that the Just Laws made, he duly Executed, and look to
<PB N="38" REF="002583_0041_0FE5D47D01349BE8"/>
it that they be Righteous in all their Administrations.</HI> It is not enough that good Laws be made, they must also be faithfully and vigorously Executed by those to whom the Executive Power belongs, or the Law will be made void, and of none Effect. The Seat of Judgment must be the Habitation of Righteousness. Rulers must look to it that the dreadful Evil spoken of, <HI>Eccl.</HI> 3.16. be not found in their Government,—<HI>I saw under the Sun, the place of Judgment, that wickedness was there</HI>—. For this is an abomination to the Lord. Prov. 17.15. <HI>He that justiseth the wicked, and be that condemneth the just, even they both are abomination to the Lord.</HI> The justifying here spoken of signifies, <Q>The acquitting him as in∣nocent by a judicial Sentence—.</Q> They must not bear the Sword in vain; but should stir up themselves against the Evil-doer, and Execute Judgment in the Gates with Courage and Impar∣tiality, not being afraid of the Faces of Men: Job 29.14. <HI>I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my Judgment was as a Robe, and a Diadem.</HI> <Q>He was Righteous in all his Administrations, as a Garment covers the whole body; he was Just in a conti∣nued Course, and did not put off this Garment from any partial respect, or for any sinister ends, yea so Righteous were his judicial Sentences, that they were the principal Honor and Ornament of his Office</Q><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Vid. Mr. <HI>Caryl,</HI> and Mr. Pool, in Loc.</NOTE>. But above all, Rulers must labour to imitate the Glorious GOD according to their measure The Charge given to the Judges in Judah by <HI>Jeboshaphat,</HI> is enforced after this manner; 2 <HI>Chron.</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="002583_0042_0FE5D47F8FBC1B50"/>
19.7. — There is no iniquity with the Lord our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of gifts. Here is their great and perfect Exemplar, and they must endeavour that their Rule may be a fair Copy and Transcript of the Justice and Equity of the di∣vine Government. And here several particulars may be briefly spoken to, which are implied in this third Head, and so may fitly be consider'd under it.</P>
<P N="1">(1) <HI>RULERS must take Care that such be En∣trusted, with the Executive Power under them, as are best qualified, and spirited to Execute Justice.</HI> There are various orders and degrees in Civil Go∣vernment, and accordingly some are intrusted with Authority to Commission others for the Administra∣tion of Justice in this or the other Post of Civil Trust. Now if such wou'd approve themselves just, they must diligently endeavour to find out and improve such persons as are most capable and best inclin'd to give to every Man his Right, and protect him in it. The Rule of proceeding in this matter must not be, Who will give most for an Office, or who hath the most powerful and wealthy friends to commend him to it; but, <HI>Let it be given to the most Worthy.</HI> For if Men are obliged to <HI>Purchase</HI> and Maintain themselves in their <HI>Places</HI> by Money, they will be under a sore temptation to <HI>Sell Justice,</HI> to the great damage of the Publick. Such then as are any ways concern'd in appointing or choosing Persons to Places of Trust &amp; Profit in the Government, must do their part that the <HI>Officers</HI> of their People may be <HI>Peace,</HI> and their <HI>Exacters Righteousness,</HI> by obser∣ving that excellent Rule, which was given to <HI>Moses</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="002583_0043_0FE5D48697028890"/>
by <HI>Jethro,</HI> Exod. 18. 21. and approved by GOD, Numb. II.I6.— <HI>Thou shalt provide out of all the peo∣ple, able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covertousness; and place such over them</HI>—. Rulers must do their utmost, according to the trust repos'd in them, that such may be set over the Peo∣ple as are Men of Piety, Men of known Ability, Men of Integrity &amp; Valiant for the Truth, Men that hate Coveteousness; for where the love of Money pre∣vails, it will be the root of many pernicious Evils, and will incline Men to pervert Judgment for Re∣ward.</P>
<P N="2">(2) <HI>THEY that are in Place of Power must take Care to Understand the Law, and then to keep to it in Administring Justice.</HI> The Legislative and Execu∣tive Power are many times put into the same Hands. Now such as have Power of Executing the Laws are then Just when they lay out themselves to Maintain and Uphold the good Laws which are made, in their full force &amp; vigour: for these are the Rule of their Go∣vernment, and of the Subjects Obedience; yea very much the foundation of the Common-Wealth, and the Pillars upon which it stands. Now in order to this, Civil Rulers must study the Law, and endeavour to furnish themselves with a sufficient Knowledge of it for the right discharge of their particular Trust. For unless they understand &amp; observe the Law, they will neither be able to attend their own Duty, nor yet to bear due Testimony against the Transgressi∣ons of others. This is a matter of so great moment, that in the <HI>Jewish State, The King himself was com∣manded by God to write him a Copy of the Law, and Read therein all the days of his life,</HI> — Deut. 17.18, 19.
<PB N="41" REF="002583_0044_0FE5D4876F85C580"/>
Now this Law comprehends in it, the <HI>Judi∣cial Laws,</HI> which were then immediately appointed by GOD, and must for ever be conform'd to the <HI>Moral Law</HI> which is an eternal Rule of Righteous∣ness <Q>A Magistrate without the Law, (says an excellent Divine,) and a Minister without the Bi∣ble, are equal absurdities: A Magistrate unskil∣ful in the Law, and a Minister ignorant in the Scripture.</Q> And indeed unless Rulers know the Laws by which they are to govern, and then take heed to observe them in administring Justice, they will not be able to say with Job 29 15. <HI>I was eyes to the blind, and seet was I to the lame.</HI> It may be of very hurtful'consequence, if such as sit in Judg∣ment have not a spirit of discerning as to the Rule they must go by in passing Sentence; but must de∣pend on them who plead before them. They must in this respect know what Israel ought to do, and be able well to distinguish between Right &amp; Wrong; and then must act with a strict regard to the Law.</P>
<P N="3">(3) <HI>THEY must shake their hands from Bribes; Administer Justice freely &amp; without respect of persons.</HI> Covetousness, which consists in an immoderate esteem of and love to this worlds goods, and appears in using unlawful Means to Enrich ourselves, is an heinous Sin, and of most pernicious tendency in those who are especially concern'd to look to it that the Common-Wealth receive no damage. Civil Rulers must therefore avoid this Sin, and be careful they do not in any measure deserve that ill character, Mic. 3.1. <HI>The heads judge for reward</HI> —. Hos 4.18. — <HI>Her Rulers with shame do love, Give ye.</HI> For
<PB N="42" REF="002583_0045_0FE5D488CA12FAC0"/>
thus the Great GOD speaks, Exod. 23.8. <HI>Thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and per∣verteth the words of the righteous.</HI> And GOD threatens that fire shall <HI>consume the tabernacles of bribery,</HI> Job 15.34. Rulers must look at the pub∣lick profit more than at their own private gain, and endeavour that <HI>Judgment may run down at waters,</HI> freely and plentifully; that so all that thirst after Righteousness may come and be refreshed. They, to whom this trust is committed, must see to it that such as serve the Publick, attend their duty faith∣fully, and then take Care that they have their just Wages paid them without any unnecessary delay, &amp; without making any private gain to themselves.</P>
<P>IN a word, they must observe that Rule, Deut. 1.17. <HI>Ye shall not respect persons in Judgment, but you shall hear the small as well as the great</HI> —. It is their duty to administer Justice impartially, and to beware of being biass'd by favour &amp; affection; or by fear of Men which brings a snare. They must <HI>look</HI> to the <HI>Merits</HI> of the <HI>Cause,</HI> not to the <HI>Parties</HI> concern'd<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fuller</HI> speaking of the good Judge hath this ingenious observation, <Q>When he put on his Robes, he put off his Relations to any; and like <HI>Melchisedeck</HI> becomes without Pedegree.</Q> <HI>Holy State,</HI> p. 259.</NOTE>. And in this respect resemble GOD, <HI>Who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work</HI> —, 1 Pet. 1.17. They must re∣solutely oppose the most Potent Offenders, and re∣lieve the oppressed that have no helper. <HI>Judge the fatherless, plead for the widow,</HI> Isai. 1.17.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="43" REF="002583_0046_0FE5D48AA9E92040"/>4. THEY that Rule over Men, <HI>must Exercise Clemency &amp; Mercy towards their People.</HI> A learned Expositor observes on this place, <Q>That we have here the Two principal Parts of a King's Duty, answerable to the two Tables of God's Law, Justice towards Men, and Piety towards GOD—. To which if you add Benignity and Clemency, whereby a King renders his Government not fright∣ful and burdensome, but acceptable and amiable to his People—. Here is a compleat Character of an excellent Prince or Governour</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pool.</HI></NOTE> . Now Righteousness in Scripture sometimes signifys Be∣nignity and Mercy: Thus, <HI>Psal.</HI> 103 17.— His Righteousness unto Childrens Children, <Q>Either his Faithfulness; or his Mercy or Benignity: This Word being frequently used in both these Senses</Q><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>id.</HI></NOTE>. And in as much as this is what Rulers are oblig'd to, if they wou'd discharge their Duty aright towards their People, it may well enough be considered un∣der the general Head of Justice. Indeed there is a Pity, falsly call'd Mercy, which is injurious to the Publick. As when such are spar'd against whom the publick Safety calls aloud for Vengeance. Such pretended Mercy to private Persons is Cruelty to the Publick. But then, there is also the Exercise of Mercy which is of great Benefit to a Community, and to Rulers themselves. It was the Character given of the Kings of lsrael, that they were <HI>Merci∣ful Kings,</HI> 1 Kings 20.31. Above all, the Son of GOD is so, infinitely Gracious and Merciful. The King's Favour is said to be as a <HI>Cloud of the latter
<PB N="44" REF="002583_0047_0FE5D48DC7FB2EB0"/>
Rain,</HI> Prov. 16.15. It is very acceptable, and a great Refeshment to his People. And oftentimes the Ex∣ercise of Clemency and Mercy is of great use and advantage to Rulers as it establisheth them in the high Esteem and sincere Affection of their People: Prov. 20.28. <HI>Mercy &amp; Truth preserve the King, and his Throne is upheld by Mercy.</HI> And as these are under God, very much the Supporters of the Throne; so of Inferiour Rulers in their Station. I shall men∣tion one Head more, like to the former.</P>
<P N="5">5. THEY that Rule over Men, must be <HI>of a Pub∣lick Spirit in the Exercise of a fatherly Love to their People, and generous Concern for their Welfare.</HI> It is very unbecoming for Persons in Publick Station, to Seek themselves inordinately, and such a vicious Self Love in them, bodes ill to the Commonwealth: 2 Tim. 3.1, 2. — <HI>Perilous times shall come. For Men shall be lovers of their own selves</HI>—. It is a most unjust thing for Persons to seek after Places of Publick Trust that they may Serve themselves rather than the People over whom they are appoin∣ted Rulers; and then to make it their great aim to seek their own, not the Publick Good. Even the Light of Nature condemns this. An <HI>Heathen Moralist</HI> cou'd say, <Q>That to make a Gain of the Common∣wealth is not only base, but also wicked and de∣testable</Q><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Habere quae stui rem pub non modo turpe est, sed Sceleration etiam et nefarium.</HI> Cicero de Offic, p. 95.</NOTE>. Certainly then such a thing shou'd not be so much as nam'd among those that call them∣selves Christians, and Rule GOD's professing Peo∣ple. <HI>e.c.</HI> They shou'd, as <HI>Mordecai,</HI> when advanced
<PB N="45" REF="002583_0048_0FE5D48FAAB70730"/>
to the highest Seat next to King <HI>Abasuerus, Seek the weal of their People, and speak peace to all their Seed</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Esth 9.3.</NOTE>. Rulers shou'd in some sort look upon the Common-wealth as their Family, and accordingly Consult and Provide for the Safety and Comfort of their People, as tender Parents. Rulers are <HI>Political Fathers,</HI> &amp; as Reverence, Obedience &amp; Recompence are due to them, so all proper Expressions of dear Affection, tender Concern, and anwearied Care for the Good of their People are due from them. This the Fifth Commandment requires, which hath this remarkable Promise annexed to it; — <HI>That thy Days may be long upon the land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</HI> Thus some suppose that they cried before <HI>Joseph, tender Father,</HI> as the word may be rendred <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Clamaverunt coram eo A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ech Margin. Quidam tonerum pat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em, interpretantur.</HI> Tig. Bible.</NOTE>. And agreeable to this we have that Pro∣mise, Isa. 49.23. <HI>Kings shall be thy nursing Fathers.</HI> In a word, They shou'd with a generous Concern sympathize with their People under all their pres∣sures, and do their utmost to Relieve them. Thus <HI>Nehemiah</HI> when he heard that the remnant of the Captivity was in great Affiction, —<HI>He wept and mourned certain days,</HI> Neh. 1.3, 4. And left the Court of <HI>Persia,</HI> where he liv'd in Honor &amp; Plenty for he was the King's Cup bearer, and took a difficult Journey that he might build <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> They shou'd be ready to say to GOD's People, when under the most afflicting Circumstances, as Psal. 137.5, 6. <HI>If I forget thee, 0 Jerusalem, let my right band forget her cunning. If I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="002583_0049_0FE5D4907443A380"/>HOWEVER, It is not eno that Civil Rulers be Just in their Administrations in the Exercise of Mo∣ral honesty towards Men, which may be in some fort, from civil respects and considerations the Kings of the Gentiles were called <HI>Bene∣factors,</HI> Luk. 22.25. No! they must act in their Exalted Station from an inward principle of Religi∣on; the Fear of that GOD, who is the Fountain of all Power, must influence &amp; regulate them in the Exer∣cise of Justice towards Men. Which brings me to,</P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>THEY that Rule over Men must Rule in the Fear of G0D.</HI> The Fear of GOD as us'd in Scripture, may sometimes be taken more stricly for that <HI>particular Grace</HI> of the Holy Spirit, where∣by we stand in awe of GOD, his infintie Excellen∣cies, and threatned Judgments; and from an holy dread of his Displeasure, fly from all Sin. And in as much as this filial, reverential Fear, which is drawn forth by a believing sight of GOD, is of such great usefulness in our Religious Serving of God; it is also put for the <HI>whole inward Principle</HI> of our Worship &amp; Service of God, and so contains in all Graces of the Spirit, which are wrought in the Soul at once and are never separated. Eccl. I2.I3. — <HI>Fear God, and keep his Commandments; for this is the whole duty of man.</HI> The whole of Man. Where it seems plain that Fear is put for the inward Prin∣ciple of Obedience, and so comprehends other Graces. Again, It is sometimes put for the <HI>outward Worship</HI> of God as prescribed by him in his Word. Isa. 29.14. <HI>Their fear towards me is taught by the precepts of Men</HI> compared with, <HI>Matth.</HI> 15.9. Yea it seems

to Comprehend both the inward Principle, and out∣ward Practice of Religion. Psal. 130.4. There is forgiveness with thee; <HI>that thou mayst be feared.</HI> The Service of God must be perform'd with <HI>Reverence and godly Fear,</HI> Heb. 12.28. Now we need not ex∣clude either of these Senses in considering the Sub∣ject before us; but may improve them all as there shall be occasion. The Glorious GOD speaks, Psal 2.0, 11, 12. <HI>Be wise, O ye Kings; be instructed ye Judges of the Earth. Serve ye the Lord with fear—.</HI> They must fear this glorious &amp; fearfull Name, <HI>the Lord their God.</HI> They must tremble for fear of him and his Judgments, who cuts off the Spirits of Princes, and his terrible to the Kings of the Earth: They must fear the Lord, and his Goodness, who hath in his Sovereign Providence made the difference between them, and the meanest under their Government; and take heed their Hearts be not lifted up above their Brethren, as if they were not of one blood with them. That word is very suitable for them, <HI>Be not high minded but fear.</HI> They who may think them∣slves above the fear of Punishment from Men, and above Reproach, must stand in awe of that GOD who <HI>pours Contempt upon Princes</HI>; Who by terrible Dispensations maketh them to know that the <HI>most High GOD ruleth in the Kingdom of Men</HI>; Who can in the midst of their sinful Pleasures <HI>loose the joints of their loyns, and cause their knees to smite one against another,</HI> by Writing, <HI>Alone, Tekel,</HI> upon them and their Kingdoms. Surely it is their great Duty and highest Wisdom to Fear GOD, Psal. 111.10. <HI>The Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom</HI>

They must Resolve with <HI>Joshua,</HI> that as for <HI>them</HI> and their <HI>houses,</HI> they <HI>will serve the Lord</HI>: They must with <HI>David, Bless their Housholds,</HI> and that by offering up the Morning and Evening Sacrifice of Prayer to GOD with them and for them. They must be Examples of Reverence and Devotion in the <HI>Publick Worship.</HI> And to speak more directly to the Subject before us, They must in all their Administrations as Rulers, Act under the governing influence of the Fear of GOD, and Regulate themselves by it. Now their Ruling in the Fear of GOD may imply such things as thefe in it;</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="49" REF="002583_0052_0FE5D49A6661F168"/>1. THEY that Rule over Men <HI>must be under the abiding influence of the Fear of God in their Admini∣strations.</HI> This holy Principle must be implanted in their Hearts by the Spirit of God, or they can't Serve God acceptably in their high Station; and it must be Operative in them to move and incline them to abide with GOD in their Calling. Thus when that Excellent Governour <HI>Nehemiah</HI> had mentioned some Mal-Administrations of former Governours where∣by they oppressed the People, he vindicates himself, and say's, <HI>But so did not I, because of the Fear of God,</HI> Ch. 5.15. This aw'd and kept him, that he did not rigorously Exact upon the People, and suffer his Ser∣vants to Rule them with Rigour, as others had done before him. The Fear of God must have a govern∣ing influence upon Rulers in accepting of Places in Government, and in discharging the Duties of them; in making and Executing Laws; or in Committing the Executive Power to others: They must in this respect Honour them that Fear the Lord. Thus <HI>Ne∣hemiah</HI> gave <HI>Hananiah</HI> together with his Brother <HI>Hanani</HI> Charge over <HI>Jerusalem</HI>; and why? <HI>For he was a faihtful Man, and feared God above many.</HI> Chap. 7.2.</P>
<P N="2">2. THEY must have <HI>a Religious Regard to the Revealed Will of God, and take Care that their Ad∣ministrations be conformed to his Word.</HI> The Word of God is the insallible and perfect Rule, according to which our Fear of him is to be Regulated, and accordingly it is call'd, the Fear of the Lord: Psal. 19 9. <HI>The fear of the Lord is clean</HI> —. <HI>i. e.</HI>"The Law and Word of God," of which the Psal∣mist is here speaking. Now this Law, or written
<PB N="50" REF="002583_0053_0FE5D49BCFC20308"/>
Word of God is profitable for the Instruction of all Men in their several Places, that they may be fur∣nished to every good Work. Particularly, Here are most Excellent Rules and Precepts given to all in Authority; and they Rule in the Fear of God, when they Rcligiously observe them, and thus Serve their Generation by <HI>the Will of God,</HI> which is given as the Character of that Pious King <HI>David,</HI> Acts 13.36. Agreeably the King of Israel was Commanded to write a Copy of the Law, and to Read therein all the Days of his Life: <HI>that he might learn to fear the Lord his God</HI>; and to keep the words of the Law—, foremention'd <HI>Deut.</HI> 17.18, 19. Indeed I do not say that the Constitution of Civil Government is just the same now, that it was then, when Gods People were under a <HI>Theocracy,</HI> and had their judicial Laws appointed immediately by God. However there are those Rules laid down in God's Word, which are of general Use and Obligation to Rulers. They must not forbid any thing which God hath required in his Law, nor command any thing which he hath for∣bidden; for this wou'd be to establish Iniquity by Law, in Defiance of the most High. It is the Duty of all in Authority, who have God's Statutes, to make them the Rule of their Government, and to have a strict regard to them, in Making &amp; Executing the Laws of the Land. This is to Rule in the Fear of God:<SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>nd thus must Rulers acknowledge their Sub∣jection to Him, who is over all, God blessed forever.</P>
<P N="3">3. They must <HI>Imitate and Resemble God in their Rule &amp; Government.</HI> GOD is the Supream Ruler of Heaven and Earth, and Civil Rulers, as they
<PB N="51" REF="002583_0054_0FE5D49F5C883EB8"/>
bear at least some outward Characters of his Majesty, his Image upon them, are in Scripture called <HI>Gods</HI>;, Psal. 82.6. <HI>I have said, ye are Gods —.</HI> Now this is a strong Obligation upon them to labour after the Image of GOD in them, that they may resemble GOD in Knowledge, Rightousness &amp; Holiness; and then Govern their People in Conformity to that perfect Pattern which God sets them in his Govern∣ment of his People. Indeed it is contrary to this Fear of God, for them to affect to be like GOD, in his <HI>Dominion</HI> over the <HI>Consciences</HI> of Men; by setting up their <HI>Wills</HI> as the <HI>Rule</HI> and Measure of right and wrong. It was blasphemous Presumption in <HI>Darius</HI> to make a Decree, That every Man that shou'd ask a Petition of any God or Man, within Thirty Days, save of him, should be cast into the Den of Lions.. And God did miraculously protect <HI>Daniel</HI> in his Pi∣ous opposition to that wicked Decree. Rulers must be willing that their Subjects shou'd obey GOD ra∣ther than them. But then it is their Duty to behold his imitable Perfections, and to be imitators of him as dear Children. That Exhortation may be applied to them, who are called the Children of the most High, Matth. 5.48. <HI>Be ye perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. THEY must <HI>Employ their Power, to maintain and advance the Fear of GOD, or true Religion, among their people.</HI> They must endeavour to deserve that Character which is given the Royal Tribe: Hos. 11.12. — <HI>Judah ruleth with God, and is faithful with the Saints.</HI> And therefore they must improve their Authority to maintain Religion in the Power
<PB N="52" REF="002583_0055_0FE5D4A7495B9588"/>
of it. They must take Care that the open Profession and Practice of Religion be kept up among their People, and vigorously oppose whatever hath a pub∣lick tendency to subvert and overthrow it. And for this End, it is their Duty to make sufficient Laws for the Punishing open Profaneness and Irreligion, as Idolatry, Blasphemy, Profane-Swearing, Sabbath-Breaking, and the like: And they must look to it, that such atrocious Crimes have an heavy Punish∣ment appointed them in the Law. They must draw the Sword of Justice, and smite such heinous Transgressors, that their Iniquity may be upon their own heads, (if they refuse to be reclaim'd,) and not cleave to the Publick. Again, It is incumbent on Civil Magistrates to take Care, that the <HI>pure Word of GOD be duly dispensed to their People.</HI> Here God teacheth us how we must Fear and Serve Him. And therefore if they wou'd promote true Piety a∣mong their People they must take heed that there be not a famine of hearing of the Words of Lord, by improving their Authority &amp; influence, that a Lear∣ned and Orthodox, a Godly and Painful Ministry, be maintained and supported among them. They shoud speak comfortably to them <HI>that teach the good Knowledge of the Lord</HI>; and see that they have a <HI>sufficient Maintenance</HI> allowed them, that they may lay out their Strength and Time in their weighty Work, without being necessarily diverted &amp; hindred by Worldly Cares &amp; Business. <HI>Nehemiah</HI>'s pious Care in this matter is worthy their imitation. <HI>Neb.</HI> 13.10, 11, 12, 13. And then, They should oblige their People to Attend the Publick Worship; and as much as may be prevent their Prophaning the Lord's Day,
<PB N="53" REF="002583_0056_0FE5D4A811A355C8"/>
either by Worldly business and recreations; or by their needless customary absenting themselves when GOD's People assemble together to Worship Him.</P>
<P>Again, THEY must take Care <HI>of the good Educa∣tion of the Children and Youth among their People,</HI> and look to it that suitable and sufficient provision be made for it. GOD's <HI>ancient People</HI> had not only <HI>inferiour Schools</HI>; but also <HI>Colleges</HI> in which the Sons of the Prophets were train'd up in the Know∣ledge of divine Things, and so prepar'd for Publick Service<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thus at <HI>Ramah,</HI> as is suppos'd, where <HI>Samuel</HI> presided; 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 19.20. See, 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 2. <Q>The Schools of the Prophets were little Universities, and Colleges of Students For their Governour they had some venerable Prophet, inspired with the Holy Spirit, and that partook of Divine Reve∣lations.</Q>— Dr. <HI>Lightfoot</HI> 2 Vol pag. 86. <Q>They had Schools in every City and Province.</Q> — <HI>Godwy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> pag. 82</NOTE>. If our Children be ignorant &amp; barba∣rous, it can't be expected but they should be profane and vicious; and therefore the Fear of GOD shou'd Excite Rulers to Exert their Authority that there may be <HI>Schools</HI> maintain'd for the Instruction and Education of Younger Children in learning to Read, that they may <HI>know the holy Scripture from their Childhood</HI>; and in learning the principles of Religi∣on contain'd in their <HI>Catechism,</HI> &amp;c. And <HI>Grammar Schools</HI> to prepare others for a more liberal Educa∣tion. They shou'd also take Care that Colleges be Erected &amp; Endowed, Maintain'd and duly Inspected; that hopeful Young Men may be Educated in Use∣ful Learning, and come forth furnish'd for the Ser∣vice of GOD and His People.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="002583_0057_0FE59B0CE15F26E0"/>IN a Word, When their People are fallen under decays in Matters of Religion, they <HI>should be Re∣formers,</HI> &amp; zealously Endeavour to bring them back to the Lord. Thus we find that when <HI>Josiah</HI> had Read in the Book of the Law, which denounc'd dreadful threatnings against the Sins rise among his People, he rent his Clothes, call'd for the <HI>Elders</HI> of <HI>Judah, Made a Covenant before the Lord to walk after the Lord; and to keep his Commandments,</HI> 2 King. 22.10, 11. Chap. 23. 1—3. And then <HI>put down the Ho'atrous Priests, d fil'd the high places,</HI> &amp;c. Thus, when Civil Rulers are under the influence of the Fear of GOD, they will improve their Power to suppress those prevailing iniquities which provoke GOD, who is the Defence and Glory of his People, to depart from them. They will tremble for the Ark of GOD, and be afraid of his Judgments, so as to lead in the necessary work of Reformation, that GOD may turn from the fierceness of his Anger, and return unto them in Mercy.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>THEY must make the Advancement of G0D's declarative Glory the chief End of their Government.</HI> This is the chief and highest End of Man. The Command is, <HI>Do all to the Glory of God,</HI> 1 Cor. 10.31. Now, when Rulers are said to Rule in the Fear of GOD, it intends that they subordinate all other views and designs to this most excellent End, and Govern their People in such a manner that GOD may be Glorified. Agreeably we have those put to∣gether, Rev. 14.7. <HI>Fear God, and give Glory to him.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="002583_0058_0FE5D4AC8A6364B0"/>I might have said, That they must Own their En∣tire Dependence upon GOD by seeking His <HI>Directi∣on and Blessing in all their Publick Managements</HI>; and by <HI>giving the Praise and Glory</HI> of all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Him.</P>
<P><HI>DOCT. IV.</HI> SUCH Rulers shall prosper themselves, and be made Great and Extensive Blessings to their People.</P>
<P><HI>HE shall be as the light of the Morning —; As the tender grass springing out of the Earth, by clear shining after rain.</HI> These Words, as we have already hinted, may be understood as a Description of the happy fruits and effects of such a Government, both to the Rulers themselves, and also to their People.</P>
<P>Here then,</P>
<P N="1">1. THEY that are just, Ruling in the fear of GOD <HI>shall Prosper.</HI> That Word, Prov. 4.18. <HI>The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more &amp; more to the perfect day,</HI> may be applied to Righteous Rulers, as well as others; and that, Mal. 4.2. <HI>Unto you that fear my Name, shall the Sun of Righteousness arise</HI> —. Such as do thus Rule with and for GOD shall arise and shine, grow &amp; in∣crease in the prosperous and flourishing State of their Government, as the Sun shines to the perfect day. Glory &amp; Honour shall be given to such, as thus ho∣nour GOD. The King of Glory will delight to ho∣nour them, by giving them the Evident tokens of his gracious Presence, and royal Favour, by Com∣manding his Blessings on their Administrations, and crowning them with the desired Success; by giving them a great interest in the Esteem and all actions
<PB N="56" REF="002583_0059_0FE5D4263135A800"/>
of their People; by establishing them in their Go∣vernment, and building them a sure house. Such Blessings as these shall just and pious Rulers obtain as the gracious Reward of their Obedience and Fi∣delity, when it shall be for GOD's Glory, and their good. Thus GOD said to <HI>Joshua,</HI> Chap. 1.8. This Book of the Law shall not depart out of thy Mouth, — that thou mayst <HI>observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then shalt thou make thy way prosperous, and then thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve good success.</HI> They shall prosper that love <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> Thus <HI>Mor∣decai</HI> expres'd a generous concern for GOD's Peo∣ple when their bloody Enemies had their necks on the block; and by a wonderful interposition of Pro∣vidence, his pious endeavours were succeded, and he was highly advanced in the Kingdom of <HI>Persia,</HI> next to <HI>King Abasuerus.</HI> David was an illustrious in∣stance of Piety &amp; Justice: <HI>He sed Gods People ac∣cording to the integrity of his heart, and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.</HI> And GOD gave him great success, and made him a Name like that of the great Men of the Earth. <HI>Hezekiah</HI> was a great Re∣former, and it is said, 2 King. 18.7. <HI>The Lord was with him, and be prospered wither soever be went forth. Daniel</HI> was a bright Example of unshaken fidelity to GOD, and love to his People, and justice in Government; and we read of him, Chap. 6.28. This <HI>Daniel prospered in the Reign of Darius, and in the Reign of Cyrus the Persian.</HI></P>
<P>BUT especially shall such prosper upon <HI>Spiritual accounts,</HI> while they lay out themselves to promote Piety and justice amorg their People: GOD will
<PB N="57" REF="002583_0060_0FE5D4AF40442168"/>
enrich them with his Grace more and more. And in a little time GOD will dismiss them with honour, as he did <HI>Daniel, Go thou thy way —, for thou shalt rest.</HI> While their Memory is blessed on Earth, their Rest shall be glorious in Heaven. At the great Day they shall shine forth as the Sun in the Kingdom of their Father. The Son of GOD will then own them as his Servants, and graciously accept what they have done to his People as done to Himself: And the painful cares, burdens and fatigues of their Go∣vernment, shall thrô the rich Grace of GOD in JE∣SUS CHRIST, work for them a <HI>far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. SUCH Rulers will be <HI>great &amp; extensive Bles∣sings to their People.</HI> Such a Government in the hap∣py fruits of it, is a great and comprehensive Blessing, like the Sun-shine and Rain in their season, whereby the Fruits of the Earth are made to spring &amp; flourish in abundance. Thus <HI>David</HI> is call'd <HI>the Light of Israel,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 21.17. When Civil Rulers are Just, Ruling in the fear of God, our Lord Jesus Christ may be said to govern in and by them, and accordingly some of those Texts which we have already quoted as De∣scribing the Blessings of His Government; may in a large Sense be applied to <HI>Solomon</HI>'s and <HI>Hezekiah</HI>'s Reigns, who were <HI>Types</HI> of CHRIST. The Just Ad∣ministration of Government in Making and Execu∣ting Righteous Laws, hath a natural tendency to pro∣mote civil Peace and Order; to make a People pros∣perous in their trade &amp; business, <HI>&amp;c. Righteousness exalteth a nation.</HI> Prov. 14.34. Such a People will become great and honourable in the sight of GOD,
<PB N="58" REF="002583_0061_0FE5D41C02083F98"/>
and the Nations round about them. <HI>Deut.</HI> 4.6, 7. Deut. 28.13. <HI>They shall be the Head.</HI> And the Bles∣sings of Religion which such a People enjoy, are in∣estimable; for <HI>Godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the Life that now is, and of that which is to come.</HI> The genuine tendency of Religion, when it generally prevails among a People, is the best Peace and Prosperity. And such a People en∣joy the especial Blessing and Favour of God, which is the Sum of all. Many and very Precious are the Promises made to Such both respecting tempo∣ral and spiritual Blessings: <HI>Lev.</HI> 26. <HI>Psal.</HI> 81. 13, — 16. Isa. 26.1, 2. <HI>We have a strong City, — Open the Gates, that the righteous nation may enter in.</HI> Certainly then such Rulers as employ their Power to promote Justice and Piety among a People, are the <HI>Ministers of God</HI> to them <HI>for Good</HI>; like the Sun, they dispense their Light and Influence, to the great Benefit and Refreshment of their People. They come down upon them as the Rain, as showers that water the Earth. Indeed the Glory of all is to be given to God, who alone can make such Rulers, and Command his Blessing on their just and pious Ad∣ministrations: They are but Instruments; He is the principal Efficient and Author of all Good. <HI>Every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights,</HI> Jam. 1.17. <HI>Moses, David, Solomon,</HI> all shone by a light deri∣ved from the Sun of Righteousness.</P>

<P>USE I. WHAT hath been said teacheth us <HI>se∣veral important Duties incumbent upon the People of God.</HI> As,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) THEY shou'd <HI>Depend on God in the way of Duty, and earnestly seek to him for Just and Pious Rulers.</HI> GOD and he alone can give these Qualifi∣cations to such as are in Authority, and enable them thus to Promote the Weal of His People. Thus God <HI>led his People like a Flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron,</HI> Psal. 77.20. He chose <HI>David</HI> his Ser∣vant, and anointed him with the Gifts and Graces of his Spirit. And thus God promis'd, Jer. 3.15. <HI>I will give you Pastors after my own heart, which shall feed you, i. e.</HI> "Rulers either in the State or Church"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eng. Annot.</NOTE>. Agreeably <HI>Calvin</HI> gives this as the Sense of the latter part of the <HI>Verse; And shall feed you with knowledge &amp; understanding, i.e. "Intelligently &amp; Prudently</HI>" <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Scienter &amp; Prudenter.</NOTE>. We shou'd then ask this great Bles∣sing of God. We should seek to God that such Ru∣lers may be set over us from time to time; and that such as are in Government may be thus Blessed, and made Blessings. Let us attend this Duty, and take heed we do not provoke GOD by our Sins, to bring that dreadful Judgment on us; Psal. 106. 41. <HI>They that hated them, Ruled over them.</HI> Let us ob∣serve that Rule, 1 Tim. 2.1. <HI>I exhort that Prayers be made for Kings, and all in Authority.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="60" REF="002583_0063_0FE5D4B1EBBA03F8"/>(2.) WHEN God gives a People <HI>such to Rule over them as in any good measure deserve the De∣scription given</HI>; They shou'd <HI>Bless God for his Fa∣vour to them.</HI> And surely We are in this respect fa∣vour'd of God above most of the <HI>Plantations,</HI> in that our <HI>Zion</HI> hath so many of her Sons at this day to take her by the Hand, of whom we may hope that they are Just, Ruling in the Fear of God. Let not the troubles we are under make us unmind∣ful of, or unthankful for such a Blessing.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) GOD's People <HI>owe to their Rulers Reverence, Obedience, &amp; Recompence.</HI> The most High hath said. Let there be a Ruler over Men; and the <HI>Fifth Command∣ment</HI> requires us to <HI>Honour</HI> our <HI>Political Fathers,</HI> who are set over us in place of Authority; and we must at∣tend this Duty if we wou'd hope that God shou'd <HI>pro∣long our Days in the land he hath given us.</HI> We must give Honour to our Rulers, to whom it is due, and take Care to treat them with all that Respect and Defe∣rence which is due to their Character and Station: Exod. 22.28. Thou shalt not Revile the Gods, nor Curse the Ruler of thy people. They are GOD's Vice∣gerents, and therefore for Men lightly to speak Evil of them, is to reflect dishonour upon GOD himself, and he will not hold them Guiltless. Yea, suppose they are fallen into Sin, we must not look upon their Nakedness with scorn and contempt, and needlesly Expose it to others; but shou'd rather cast a Covering over it. <HI>Fear God, Honour the King.</HI> Again, <HI>We must Obey them in the Lord.</HI> The Commands of God, obliging us to yield Subjection to Rulers
<PB N="61" REF="002583_0064_0FE5D4B5ABDAA770"/>
in lawful things, are very plain and forcible: R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. 13.1. <HI>Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers.</HI> — v.5. <HI>Ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.</HI> 1 Pet. 2.13 —15.

Yea, when the Children of Israel Mur∣mured <HI>against Moses and Aaron,</HI> GOD sent a <HI>plague among them,</HI> v.46. A levelling Spirit is a very evil Spirit, and highly provoking to GOD. Let us be∣ware of it, and wherein we have been guilty, be deeply humbled before GOD. Again, The People must <HI>Recompence their Rulers with a Reward</HI> which shall bear some <HI>just proportion to the weight and dif∣ficulty of their Service.</HI> They should not be strait∣handed towards their Rulers, but cheerfully Reward their Care and Labour for the Publick Good, with a liberal and honourable Maintenance, becoming the Dignity of their Station, and sufficient for the Ex∣pences which the Honour of the Government, or their own Comfort demand of them. This is not an Act of Charity, but Justice: And the Law of GOD requires it. <HI>Rom.</HI> 13.7. Render therefore to all their dues: <HI>tribute to whom tribute is due</HI> —.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) THEY <HI>ought in all proper ways to Assist &amp; Encourage their Rulers in the Right Discharge of their Duty.</HI> They must in their several Places stand up for them, while in the Execution of their Authority. As they said to <HI>Ezra,</HI> Chap. 10.4. <HI>Arise, for this matter belongeth unto thee &amp; we also will be with thee</HI> —. Thus <HI>Heads of Families,</HI> should in their Places be helpful by Maintaining Religion and good

Order in their own Houses, That there may not from thence proceed Sons of Belial that shake off the Yoke, and despise Government. Particularly, Such as <HI>keep Publick Houses,</HI> should be careful that Temperance, Sobriety and good Hours be observed, that no Disturbance may arise by excessive Drink∣ing, Quarrelling, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Again, <HI>Under Officers,</HI> and others shou'd be ready to aid and assist their Rulers, and Defend their Pesons, when they may have to do with such as are spoken of in our Context, <HI>v.</HI> 6, 7. <HI>The sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands.</HI> But the Man that shall <HI>touch them,</HI> must be <HI>fenced with iron, and the staff of a spear.</HI> Again, Such who are in the Providence of GOD, call'd <HI>to inform and give Evidence against Offenders,</HI> that they may be brought to Justice, ought in their Places to attend their duty without fear or favour, or foolish Pity. Again, Wherein Civil Rulers attend their Duty in the fear of GOD, <HI>the People should Accept it with all Thankfulness,</HI> and not discourage them by groundless Jealousies and uncharitable surmises.</P>
<P>USE 2. WHAT hath been said <HI>affords seasonable Direction to those that are especially concerned in the Business of this Day.</HI> This Day is a <HI>Witness</HI> of GOD's Patience exercised towards us, notwithstand∣ing all our Sins whereby we have provok'd Him.

May this People, who have ever Express'd their Joy and Satisfaction in the Prosperity of his <HI>Royal Per∣son</HI> and illustrious <HI>House,</HI> find life in the light of his Countenance, and not be call'd to weeping &amp; mourn∣ing under the loss of their precious &amp; pleasant Things. We lift up our Eyes unto thee, O GOD! from whom must Come our Salvation. Save, Lord, let the King hear us when we call But to return. Let those to whom this weighty Trust is committed, Consider what GOD the LORD says; <HI>They that Ru'e over Men must be Just, Ruling in the Fear of GOD</HI>; and direct their choice accordingly. Take heed you be not biass'd by personal favour, or a party-Spirit. Let such be prefer'd in your Choice as are most Capable and best inclined to Promote Piety towards GOD, and Justice towards Men. This is a divine Rule, and therefore there is no dan∣ger of being mislead by it.</P>
<P>USE 3. LET the Truths deliver'd be <HI>improv'd in an humble Address to the Honourable, the</HI> LIEUT. GOVERNOUR, COUNCIL <HI>and</HI> REPRESENTATIVES. Hear and Obey the Message which the Great GOD sends unto you this Day, how mean soever the Mes∣senger may be. <HI>The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that Ruleth over Men must be Just, Ruling in the Fear of God.</HI> The glorious JE∣HOVAH who is your <HI>Judge,</HI> your <HI>Law-giver,</HI> and your <HI>King,</HI> speaks to you in these Words, and it most

nearly concerns the welfare of your own Persons, and of your Government, that you obey his Voice. You have a Price put into your Hands to promote the Honour of GOD, and the Good of your Country: City to GOD for Wisdom to improve it, that you may be great and publick Blessings while you Live, and be Blessed forever with the Lord, when a short Life shall come to an End. We are a degenerate People, iniquity abounds, and GOD is going on in a way of Judgment against us. His Voice to us in his Providence may be that, Ezek. 22.30. <HI>I sought for a man among them that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it.</HI> Do you then stand in the Gap and do your utmost to keep off Wrath from this Peo∣ple, by Promoting that most necessary Work of Re∣formation. Lead in this Work by being your selves conspicuous Examples of Sobriety, Justice and Godli∣ness. Whatever Laws may be further needful to Encourage Virtue &amp; Piety among us; or to suppress Vice and Profaneness, let them be Enacted; and let those good Laws which are made, be duly Executed. Here I wou'd ask leave to mention a few things. Be Intreated to Guard against all Neglect or <HI>Corruption of the Worship of GOD.</HI> Be jealous for the Lord of hosts; <HI>for the Lord our GOD is a jealous God, visiting the Iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children.</HI> Let all due Care be taken that God's People may <HI>fear this glorious and fearful Name the Lord our God.</HI> Alas! Profane-Swearing is become in a dreadful de∣gree Customary with many. There are those that set their Mouths against Heaven, and rend the Sa∣cred

Name of GOD, by Profane Oaths and Curses. May not something further be done to suppress this Heaven-daring Sin? Doth it not deserve a heavier Penalty than is affixed to it in the Law? Ought not this part of Religious Worship, the calling GOD to Witness in Swearing, be attended with greater Reverence in our <HI>Courts of Judicature,</HI> that Men may be taught to <HI>Fear an Oath</HI> Improve your Au∣thority that the <HI>Lord's Day Sabbath</HI> may be <HI>strictly observed.</HI> GOD gives his Sabbath to his People as a Sign between him and them; and strictly requires them so to <HI>Remember it, as to keep it holy</HI>; Exod. 20. Jer. 17.21, 23, 27. And it hath been often ob∣serv'd that as the <HI>Sabbath</HI> is Sanctified or Profan'd so Religion is won't to flourish or decay. This then is most worthy your Pious Care. Blessed be GOD for the Good Laws we have to bind us to this Duty; and for that Care which is taken to Execute them. However, There is need that some further Care be taken, that under a pretence of keeping the Night before or after the Sabbath day light, both Evenings be not us'd as common Time. And is not the Evil Custom of keeping open Shops on the Evening before the Day, a Prophanation of the Sabbath, which ought to be Reform'd? And then, As there ought to be no Recreations, no carrying of Burdens, no needless Journeys on the Lord's Day, so it might be a very acceptable Service to GOD, if some effectual Means were us'd to suppress Disorders between Meetings in our Country Towns, where they live at a conside∣rable Distance from the Place of Publick Worship, and tarry at or near the Meeting-House. As also to

prevent all unnecessary Harnessing of Horses, and Driving of Coaches on the Lord's Day; that both Man and Beast may Rest according to the Command∣ment. Yea to prevent the <HI>attending of Funerals</HI> when no present Necessity requires it. <HI>Let the Means of Education be esteem'd worthy your highest Concern.</HI> In a particular manner I wou'd most humbly Recom∣mend the <HI>College</HI> to your Parental Care. It is an abiding Testimony of the Pious Concern our Fore∣Fathers had for the flourishing of Religion, that they so Early Erected that <HI>Society,</HI> which hath been a great Blessing to the whole Land; a Fountain continually <HI>sending forth streams that have made Glad the City of our God</HI>; yea have refresh'd distant Places also. But the Sovereign GOD hath In a sudden and aw∣full manner taken their <HI>Master</HI> from their Head; the <HI>Reverend &amp; Learned President</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">The Honourable <HI>John Leverett</HI> <ABBR>Esq;</ABBR></NOTE>. And it is a matter of great importance to the Land, and particularly to these Churches, that this <HI>Breach</HI> be repaird with One who is of eminent Learning, Pru∣dence, Piety, and a fast Friend to the Interests of CHRIST's Kingdom among us. My humble Re∣quest therefore is, that all needfull Encouragement may be given to such a Person to Reside at the Col∣lege, and lay out himself in that Excellent Work of training up the Youth in Pure Religion, and good Literature. May that GOD <HI>with whom is the Resi∣due of the Spirit,</HI> fill that <HI>Chair</HI> with One who shall be a Rich Gift to that Society, and a Blessing to the whole Land. May the <HI>College</HI> Flourish so long as the Sun and Moon shall endure!</P>

For where there is <HI>Contention,</HI> there is <HI>Confusion,</HI> and every Evil Work. Now it is a weighty Word which I find delivered by <HI>a great Divine,</HI> and shall ask leave to borrow it. <Q>If Ma∣gistrates would Unite the People, then take heed, agree among your selves, if you would have Union among the People: if the Corner-Stones once fall asunder, you may easily expect many Cracks in the building: differences amongst Governours must needs cause strange distractions among the People—.

for the Preservation of the Country. The LORD grant that our <HI>Jerusalem may be builded as a City that is compact together,</HI> and that by your Means; That you may have much <HI>of the Wisdom which is from above, which is first pure, then peaceable</HI>—. And Unite as One Man in Consulting &amp; Promoting the Publick Welfare.</P>
<P>AGAIN, Let me humbly Inquire, Whether some∣thing further may not be done, <HI>to put a stop to the the growth of Intemperance, and Excessive Drink∣ing,</HI> which threatens us with an over-flowing Scourge of Woes and Miseries. <HI>Isai.</HI> 28.1, 2. Wo—to the Drunkards of <HI>Ephraim</HI>—. Where this Sin pre∣vails, it provokes GOD to withdraw even the com∣mon Restraints of his Spirit. Eph. 5.18. <HI>Be not drunk with wine, wherein is Excess; but be filed with the Spirit. Sensual, having not the Spirit,</HI> Jude v.I9. Now it is Notorious that this shameful Vice is dreadfully predominant in this Land. And it is high Time to inquire, Whether the numerous <HI>Li∣cences</HI> given to <HI>Tavern-keepers</HI> and other <HI>Retailers</HI> of Strong Drink, do not greatly provoke GOD, and cause the guilt of this hainous Sin to lie heavy upon the Publick? Is not the good use of Taverns mischievously perverted? Is it not Scandalous to the Profession of Christianity, that Publick Houses shou'd be so much frequented by Town-dwellers? Undoubtedly it is. And it is your Duty by your Example and Authority to testify against this Abuse.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="002583_0072_0FE5D4CA1F550EA0"/><HI>Lastly,</HI> MY Text leads me to Commend it to Your Endeavours, That <HI>the Publick Faith and justice be preserved, relating to our Bills of Credit,</HI> which are sunk much below the Value of their <HI>Denomi∣nation.</HI> The Eighth and Ninth Commandments require You to take effectual Care that the <HI>Bills of Publick Credit,</HI> which are in a manner the only Medium of Trade, be not made a Cruel Engine of Oppression.

O that GOD wou'd Unite the hearts of this People to fear big Name, and work Righteousness! Then we might Hope to have that good Word fulfilled in us: Isai. 58. 8, 9. <HI>Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth Speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee, the glory of the LORD shall be thy rere-ward. Then shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am</HI>:—.</P>
