<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>READER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MANKIND, when addressed upon interesting subjects, usually with to know something of the person, and his motives, by whom they are addressed.</P>
<P>THIS necessary information, when sufficiently obtained, generally removes all grounds of deception and consequent dissatisfaction.</P>
<P>IN conformity to these sentiments, the Author of the following Address, informs the Reader, that, he has con∣stantly resided in the City, during the calamity of 1793, 1797, and the pre∣sent year: and, has seen, felt, and suf∣fered much, therein: which, from time to time, has given rise to various obser∣vations and reflections, that are here presented to public view.</P>
<P>THE principal objects, of this publi∣cation, are neither fame, nor pecuniary emoluments: subjects of far greater mag∣nitude and consequence; the glory of
<PB N="6" REF="033464_0004_0FF7401CECE92588"/>
God—the reformation and salvation of the inhabitants of this City—the good of mankind—and, his own peace of mind —have, as far as he knows his own heart, been his leading motives.</P>
<P>IN attempting a work of this kind, ma∣ny discouragements have arisen, parti∣cularly a sense of unfitness and inability; but knowing the terrors of the Lord, and feeling a woe from God denounced against him, if he did not, in this way, endeavour to persuade men to repent∣ance; he has endeavoured to comply, under a constraining sense of religious duty; desiring to commit its effects to God, who is able to carry on his designs in whatever way he pleases; and, does frequently make use of weak, and ap∣parently very unlikely means, to answer important and beneficial purposes.</P>

<HEAD>AN ADDRESS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>FEELING, as I apprehend, an ardent de∣sire for the promotion of the cause of truth and righteousness in the earth; and viewing the present dispensation—as,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> A Judgment from God, <HI>Secondly,</HI> A Judgment mixed with mercy. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> A Judg∣ment designed for the punishment of sin; and the reformation and benefit of mankind.—And <HI>Fourth∣ly,</HI> As a Judgment, that, unless suitably attended to, will probably be followed by more vindictive tokens of divine displeasure.</P>
<P>I SHALL, in attending to this Judgment, under this fourfold view, intreat you in the first place, to view it as coming from God. Oh, the duty, the indispensible duty of professed christians to acknowledge God, not only in all their own, but in all his ways.</P>
<P>IN times of calamity, especially such as the present, as well as in prosperity; the enemy of all righteousness, is busy, very busy, not only with the openly wicked and profane; but, also, not unfrequently, with the more thoughtful and conscientious; if possible, to bewilder and divert their minds from the truth; thereby to deprive
<PB N="8" REF="033464_0006_0FF740C40F39BC50"/>
God of the glory, and mankind of the benefit, that would otherwise ensue. And no marvel the ene∣my is thus busy! for of all the dispensations of divine providence, perhaps, none has a more di∣rect tendency to bring the mind home to God. than the present if rightly understood: but this will be more fully considered in its proper place.</P>
<P>NOT only the grand adversary immediately, but likewise worldly wisdom instrumentally, serves to perplex and obscure divine truths, agreeably to that scripture declaration "The world by wisdom knew not God."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. i. 21.</NOTE> Neither does it by its own wisdom clearly understand his operations, either in a way of Judgment or mercy.</P>
<P>THE holy scriptures, in relating God's Judg∣ments upon Pharaoh, and the Egyptians, mention the instrumentality of Moses and Aaron, and the Rod of God, &amp;c. in bringing and oftentimes in removing most of the dispensations, excepting the pestilence. In that, nothing of the instrumenta∣lity of Moses or Aaron appear to have been em∣ployed; but the immediate Hand of God, or his destroying angel, dealt the avenging, the irresisti∣ble blow. Some of the dispensations were attempt∣ed to be imitated and accounted for, by the magicians, and other wise men of Egypt, by na∣tural causes. But the pestilence, or plague, was a dispensation; the Egyptians, and even the
<PB N="9" REF="033464_0007_0FF74038067C8D90"/>
hard hearted Pharaoh viewed as coming imme∣diately from God, and bowed before it as such, and obeyed the Lord by letting his people depart, according to his commands.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. vii. xii.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE scriptures also in relating the plague that was sent upon the Philistines for detaining the ark of God, mention it, not only as sent by the immediate Hand of God; but, as so viewed by the Philistines themselves, at least by their priests and diviners, when they advised them to give glory to the God of Israel; and not to harden their hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharoah had done. And though it seems these priests and diviners, afterwards, got into a doubting state, (like some at the present day) concerning the great evil, that happened unto them; whether it was the Hand of the Lord? or something, that came upon them by chance? Yet God, in the course of his provi∣dence, caused their own predictions to be verified in such a manner, as to prove beyond a doubt, that his hand and not a blind chance directed the plague that was upon the Philistines and their lords; for removing and obstructing the institutions of his worship.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Samuel, v. vi.</NOTE></P>
<P>DAVID in scriptures stiled a man after God's own heart viewed the pestilence as coming imme∣diately from the hand of God; for when famine, war, and pestilence, were proposed unto him, for
<PB N="10" REF="033464_0008_0FF740CB9B45EF00"/>
his selection or choice, he chose the pestilence in preference to either of the other calamities, as he viewed it under the more immediate agency and direction of the most high.</P>
<P>AND when the pestilence came, and David was permitted to see the cause of the people's destructi∣on; nothing either from the air, or from any o∣ther of the long train of second causes seemed to claim any share therein, but the angel of the Lord appeared to be the immediate dispenser of death<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Samuel. xxxiv.</NOTE></P>
<P>SO in the case of Sennacherib, King of Assy∣ria, who by his messenger, reproached the living God; and by himself and his army threatened to bring destruction upon Jerusalem: blasphemously entertaining and expressing unbelief of God's pow∣er and sufficiency to deliver the people that trusted in him:—The pestilence destroyed the army of this blasphemous and unbelieving King.—By means of second causes? No; they fell by the immediate hand of the angel of God:—Who in one night, a fatal night! smote with death, One Hundred and Eighty Five Thousand!<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isaiah. xxxvi. xxviii.</NOTE></P>
<P>OTHER instances, might be mentioned from scripture to prove the immediate and direct agen∣cy of the Almighty in the pestilence, without the intervention of that train of second causes, so com∣monly instrumental in the generating and promo∣ting of most other diseases: But, the foregoing,
<PB N="11" REF="033464_0009_0FF7403EDD3975E8"/>
being (I think) so much in point; and as, I wish to study brevity as far as consistent with perspi∣cuity, I shall not enlarge from scripture under, this head.</P>
<P>COMMON history, if consulted, would no doubt in many instances, confirm the belief of God's im∣mediate agency, in all dispensations like the pre∣sent; but I shall now confine my observations prin∣cipally to what relates immediately to this city.</P>
<P>SOMETHING like a specimen of the present ca∣lamity, was foreseen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Thomas Chalkley's Journal, page 205.</NOTE>, foretold and realized; more than half a century past: but a kind providential language seemed to be; how shall I give thee up, O Philadelphia!</P>
<P>BUT in 1793, an alarm was sounded! A trum∣pet of divine displeasure blown! A dispensation sent! Before which, the loftiness of man, was bowed down, the haughtiness of men laid low and the Lord alone was exalted, with many in that day. The men of knowledge, the men of science, the men of the wisdom of this world, attempted to fathom the cause, but most of them failed; their asserti∣ons in some instances were not strictly true, con∣vincing to others, or satisfactory to their own minds. The first report of common fame, (which sometimes speaks true) was, "The plague has broke out in Water-street."</P>
<P>ON some of those fatal days, about the 10th of the 10 Month (October) 1793: when all faces ga∣thered
<PB N="12" REF="033464_0010_0FF740CF8F4EE260"/>
blackness, the bands of society seemed dissol∣ving, and human nature shuddered and almost sunk under feeling apprehensions of God's with∣drawing his support, his presence, and his protection from this city: Who, then doubted of his imme∣diately directing the dreadful scourge?</P>
<P>MOST, if not all, were convinced it was a judg∣ment sent by the immediate hand of God:—And that nothing but the same hand or power could remove it.</P>
<P>MANY were brought very low, the prevailing language then was, Lord, save me! Only carry me through this dispensation alive, and I will serve thee forever!</P>
<P>THE Lord heard—In the midst of wrath, he remembered mercy—The disorder stopt—By what means? By the Lord's saying to the destroying Angel which smote the people; It is enough; stay now thine hand.</P>
<P>MY soul is often humbly affected both for myself and others on account of broken cove∣nants: did proffessors of religion; or others keep their covenants made, in those hours of sore distress and bitterness of soul, from the lowest depths of woe with Almighty God?</P>
<P>THE succeeding more than usual pomp and parade of fashion—The unabated, increased and the insatiable thirst after riches, vanities, sinful pleasures and vain amusements: shewed but too plainly, great forgetfulness—great neglect—great
<PB N="13" REF="033464_0011_0FF74043EF32AFF8"/>
unmindfulness, of what was past, and great danger of what was to come.</P>
<P>THE widow's gloom was scarcely removed— parents tears had not ceased to flow—nor the re∣latives sigh, forgot to heave; in remembrance of last year's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1797.</NOTE> calamity; when the dread alarm again assailed our tingling ears—approached our af∣frighted habitations—and siezed our troubled minds. Plainly shewing, that God has neither lost his power; nor sin, its offensive and destroy∣ing nature.</P>
<P>HERE, let us make a solemn pause! stand still! and, view the wonderful works of God! and behold what desolations sin hath made in the City: swept as it were with the bosom of destruction!</P>
<P>ARE not the scriptures of truth, the revelations of God to his servant John,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rev. vi 15, 16, 17.</NOTE> in part fulfilling and verified in this dispensation. Where now are the rulers of the earth, the great men—the rich men—the chief of captains—the mighty men— the bond man—the free man? may not many of them be said, as it were, to have hid themselves, in the dens, and in the rocks of the mountains? saying by their conduct, to the mountains and rocks, fall on us, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>de us, from the face of him, that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the lamb; for the great day of his wrath is come: and, who shall be able to stand?</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="033464_0012_0FF740D7CC982AB8"/>ARE not some of the prophecies of Isaiah,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah. iii. xxiv.</NOTE> re∣specting the jows, verified as concerning this ci∣ty? Hath not the Lord, the Lord of hosts, taken away from Philadelphia, the mighty man, and the man of war, the judge and the prophet, and the prudent and the ancient, the captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counsellor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator? Hath not the Lord made the city empty and waste, and turned it upside down, and scattered abroad the inhabitants thereof? And is it not, as with the peo∣ple, so with the priest: as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress, as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with the giver of usury to him?</P>
<P>IS not this city defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting co∣venant? And therefore, hath not the curse devour∣ed the city, and they that dwell therein are de∣solate; and few men left? Hath not the mirth of tabrets ceased, the noise of them that rejoice ended, the joy of the harp ceased? Is not the city of con∣fusion broken down? Is not almost every house shut up, that no man may come in? Is not the city left desolate, and the borders thereof smitten with destruction?</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="033464_0013_0FF7404BADBEE830"/>HAS not the state of the city, in some measure, been similar to the lamentable situation of Jerusa∣lem, as described by the prophet Jeremiah.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lament. i. 1, &amp;c.</NOTE> Does not the city sit solitary, that was full of people? Is she not become as a widow? She that was great among the states! and Princess among the provin∣ces! Have not the ways of Philadelphia mourned; because so few came to her solemn feasts? Are not her gates desolate? Have not her priests sigh∣ed? Her virgins been afflicted? And did not the adversaries see her, and mock at her sabbaths?</P>
<P>IS it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? Behold and see if there be any sorrow like unto our sor∣row, which is done unto us, wherewith the Lord hath afflicted us in the day of his fierce anger.</P>
<P>AGAIN, how solemn, how earnest, was the prophet Isaiah, in his denunciation upon, and expostulation with the Jews formerly? (In order, effectually, to bring them off from all vain hopes, and improper expectations, of escaping the right∣eous judgments of God.) When, (in language, no doubt, applicable to the present time and dis∣pensation) he thus addressed them, "Because ye have said, we have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreemement: when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we have made lies our re∣fuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves. Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Your covenant
<PB N="16" REF="033464_0014_0FF740E1987D9F70"/>
with death shall be disannulled, and your agree∣ment with hell shall not stand; when the over∣flowing scourge shall pass through, then shall ye be trodden down by it. From the time that it goeth forth shall it take you: for morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night; and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report. For the Lord shall rise up as in Mount Perazim, he shall be wroth as in the Valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act.</P>
<P>"NOW therefore, be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord of hosts a consumption, even determined, upon the whole earth."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah. xxviii.</NOTE></P>
<P>AND may we not say of this dispensation, as the prophet said in another case, "This also cometh forth from the Lord of hosts; which is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working."<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isaiah. xxviii. 29.</NOTE></P>
<P>A PARTICULAR attention to the last mentioned words, in their distinct order, may serve to con∣vince us, more fully, of the propriety of their quotation.</P>
<P>"THIS" This dispensation, that hath humbled the pride of man—this calamity—this fever—this pestilence—this plague—or, whatever name it may be called by:—that hath done, and is doing; that, which nothing but the immediate hand of
<PB N="17" REF="033464_0015_0FF74050EB2E4688"/>
God could do: in that, it hath shaken the king∣dom of Satan, to its foundation, in the hearts of many of the inhabitants of this City—that, in a few days, as it were at one stroke, hath brought home to the minds of all (not incurably hardened) the belief of a God—his superintending providence —and, immediate agency in this dispensation— That hath done at once—what days, weeks, months, years, yea many years, of instrumental labours, and lighter calamities, did not effect; evidently "also cometh forth from the Lord of hosts," is an inscription, in such legible charac∣ters, as, that he who runs, may read it upon this judgment, so secret in approach—so sudden in at∣tack—and, so fatal, so universal in operation: And, as proceeding from him, "which is wonderful in counsel," is one link, in the great chain, of the wonderful counter of God: And, although, at some dark times and seasons, the mystery of iniquity may seem very deep; and the kingdom and cause of Satan ready to prevail, and triumph in the world. Yet all, I believe, is ordered and directed in unerring wisdom; and however low and discouraging, to the rightly exercised chris∣tian, the cause of God and truth may appear to be in the earth: Yet, it never was, nor ever will be, totally extinct. But sometimes it appears, that the lowest depths, serve as foundations for the greatest heights of the testimonies of truth; and, for the promotion thereof in the earth. And
<PB N="18" REF="033464_0016_0FF740E6ADFEFE70"/>
however various and many are the devices of men's hearts, yet the counsel of the Lord! that shall stand. "And excellent in working." Indeed will God appear to be in this dispensation; if some of the excellent productions thereof be duly considered, in respect of many of those individuals, who have improved it aright. Has it not, in ma∣ny instances, opened a way for the display of the most excellent qualities of the man, and the chris∣tian? Such as, saith, hope, charity—a weaned∣ness from the world—dependance on God alone— repentance—reformation—clear prospects and foretastes of heaven—triumph over death: and, to sum up all in a word, love to God, and love to men.</P>
<P>THESE are the Lord's doings! marvellous to us! And will be so in the eyes of succeeding ge∣nerations! Amen.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, this Judgment may, in the second place, be viewed as mixed with mercy.</P>
<P>WELL may the surviving inhabitants of Phila∣delphia, in adoring language, of the deepest hu∣mility, and heartfelt gratitude, acknowledge it is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed: And could we be permitted to lift the veil, that separates time from eternity; we should no doubt behold, that the boundless mercy of Christ, the Mediator, who, when on earth, was called the friend of publicans and sinners; who came not to
<PB N="19" REF="033464_0017_0FF7405B76590278"/>
call the righteous, but sinners to repentance; who received the penitent thief from the cross into Pa∣radise: has interceded with his father, in the midst of wrath, to remember mercy to many poor souls; hid, in the vale of poverty and obscurity; (per∣haps great wickedness) from much of the notice and attention of the world—seized, as it were in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, with all the terrors—all the horrors of death! Intimate friends, none; or far away—the black sick carriage at the door—the dreary Hospital in view—and Potter's Field in expectation. On high, God an∣gry for sin.—Below, Hell yawning to receive. In this situation, all that many a poor (though pre∣cious) soul could do, was the utterance of a groan or sigh:—Lord help me! Or casting a desponding look toward Heaven, for mercy. In this misery extreme, I believe the Lord, whose tender mer∣cies are over all the works of his hand, has fre∣quently looked down from the height of his sanc∣tuary, and out of Heaven has beheld the earth; not to see the pomp and parade of princes; nor the vanities and glories of this world; but to hear the groanings of the (afflicted spiritual) prisoner; and to loose such as seemed appointed both to temporal and eternal death: and in their last mo∣ments, has reached forth salvation:—and has raised them from the depths of woe on earth, to the heights of joy in Heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="033464_0018_0FF740ECC1E67EF8"/>NEITHER was the distress, nor mercy of the dispensation confined to the abject poor alone:— but the horror and distress seemed as universal as sin—and the mercy of God as boundless as the objects that claimed his attention.</P>
<P>SOME, of all classes of citizens, have remained in the city: Numbers from motives of conscience, (may it not almost be said) pure as truth, and disin∣terested as the means of salvation. Some remained under a constraining necessity; some to receive benefit themselves; some to impart it to others, generally, all from good motives; or, at least but very few (I believe) from those that were repre∣hensible.</P>
<P>NOR were those who fled, worthy of blame:— many fled as influenced by a warning voice, to escape impending destruction; some chose to, and did continue, almost within sight, and certainly within reach of feeling the distresses and afflictions of those who remained behind. Almost unbounded was the charity of many: and great the anxiety and concern of most, if not all, who were ab∣sent.</P>
<P>INDEED the mercy of God was evident in in∣fluencing some to go, others to stay: had all fled, who would have suffered? Had all tarried, who would have escaped? Therefore if any glory, for tarrying and being useful, let them glory in the Lord; if any rejoice for fleeing and being safe, let them rejoice with fear and trembling: and
<PB N="21" REF="033464_0019_0FF6804CC5073758"/>
those who fled, and those who tarried, unite in charitable dispositions—brotherly love—thankful hearts—and reformed lives.</P>
<P>BUT to return more particularIy to the mix∣ture of mercy and judgment in this dispensation: Solomon said, "money answereth all things." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccles. x. 19,</NOTE> And although a scripture phrase; may perhaps be taken in a more general sense, than the author designed: if this has ever been the case, many are now undecieved. This calamity was no respecter of persons: money had no charms for the pestilence Riches could offer no availing bribe to death: as said a celebrated poet:</P>
<L>"Their golden cordials could not ease</L>
<L>Their pained hearts, and aching heads,</L>
<L>Nor fright, nor bribe approaching death,</L>
<L>From glittering roofs and downy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eds."<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dr. Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</NOTE></L>
<P>And as on the one hand, riches did not raise the minds of men above sinning; so on the other, it did not excuse them from the bitter cup of suffer∣ings. However captivating riches may appear in the view of most men, in times of worldly prospe∣rity; yet it may be viewed as one of the mercies of this dispensation, that riches thereby, were set in a true and subordinate light: A drop of water to cool the parched tongue, and a fanning breeze of refreshing air, to allay the scorching heat of pesti∣lential
<PB N="22" REF="033464_0020_0FF740F152F681E8"/>
flames; were in many cases, all the luxu∣ries the most unbounded wealth could give: or the most voluptuous receive.</P>
<P>AN instantaneous view of approaching eternity; eclipsed in a moment, all the glory of this world, in the eyes of many, and cut asunder the con∣nections of time and sense: and the soul by an act of faith, cast upon the unmerited mercy of God alone: immediately received a peace and a satisfactory assurance, and a stayedness of mind as far above what this world, in its most prosperous state can bestow: as the heavens are above the earth. And were enabled, by the boundless mercy of God, to leave a scene, which at best, as it related to temporal prosperity, was replete with disappoint∣ments to enter upon a state; glorious in prospect, perfect in enjoyment, and endless in duration!</P>
<P>GREAT numbers, (charity hopes the greatest number) of those, who have been removed by this dispensation, have given those survivors, who at∣tended them, in their last moments, satisfactory hopes of their future well being.</P>
<P>FOR the justness of this observation; I appeal to surviving relatives—religious visitants—feeling physicians, and others:—who attended the cham∣bers of the sick, and dying in 1793, 1797, and the present year, whether they have not been frequent∣ly witnesses for God; that his judgments have been mixed with unbounded mercy?</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="033464_0021_0FF7406972F40D58"/>FREQUENTLY, very frequently! After all that imgination can conceive and often more than any language can express, of horror and despair, has been seen and heard, in the unutterable dis∣tress and anguish usually attending this disorder; after the most heart piercing shrieks! terrifying convulsions! and, distorting agonies! have ex∣hausted all their terrors, all their woes! Then, a gleam of extended mercy—a beam of divine light—a ray of immortal glory—has, with ineffa∣ble splendour, darted through all the horrors of the gloom—the distressed soul, enlivened by the joys of God's salvation; breathed high aspirations for its native land—assuming heavenly tranquility, before unknown—triumphing over death and the grave—has quit the abode of clay—and, amid exulting angelic hosts of guardian spirits—wing∣ed its way towards the Paradise of God.</P>
<P>THUS the rich and the poor do meet together: and the Lord is not only the Maker of them all, but likewise the Redeemer and Saviour of many; it is to be hoped most of them.</P>
<P>THOSE who survive have occasion to speak of mercy as well as of Judgment: Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lament. iii. 39.</NOTE></P>
<P>IS it not a mercy from God, who influences the hearts of all men in virtuous actions, that such

<P>IN enumerating the mercies of God, may we not mention—sires seldom happened; few angry disputations took place; markets were well sup∣plied; resignation and stayedness upon God were experienced: and his divine presence, at times, very sensibly felt, both in public and private devo∣tions.</P>

<P>THE winds and the weather, (subordinate mi∣nisters of providence) have also been directed in much mercy.—But in attempting to speak of the mercies of God, I am launching into a boundless ocean! they are innumerably made known to us every morning, yea every moment of our lives! and more especially conspicuous at this time, when contrasted with the afflictive judgments of the present dispensation.</P>

Why are conve∣niences sacrificed for elegancies? And else, why are necessaries parted with for show?</P>

<HEAD>IDLENESS.</HEAD>
<P>IDLENESS was one of the sins that caused the destruction of Sodom, and has no doubt been very instrumental in procuring the present calamity.</P>
<P>IDLENESS is a wasting of time, doing nothing, or doing that which answers no good purpose.</P>
<P>IT is said in scripture, "All the Athenians and strangers which were there, spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts. xvii. 21.</NOTE> Oh this idle curiosity! how it throngs all places of public resort, with those whose prin∣cipal employment is to waste or kill time: these are active idlers—others, more passive, live like birds shut up in cages: to them unseen, the eye∣lids of the morning open in the East; to them are unknown and unenjoyed the delightful and healthy exercise of early morning walks,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I have frequently seen, with instruction and satisfaction, the Roman Catholics, Methodists, &amp;c. in their early morning walks, to and from their public devotions, with countenances at once expressive of health and sincerity.</NOTE> when pure re∣freshing

balsamic air may be inhaled; uncontami∣nated by filth, dust, or smoke; when the ear may be soothed and charmed, and the mind very sensibly impressed and instructed, with the harmony and the joys of innocence, by the feathered songsters of the grove, who raise their artless and hal∣lowed lays, to the great Parent of the universe, at the rising dawn of returning day; when the eye may be regaled with the extensive usefulness, beauty and glory of the rising sun; a sight almost worthy of adoration, from a heathen! and at least a tribute of gratitude and praise to God from a christian!</P>
<P>TO some, whose bodies are enervated by froth, and their minds debased by idleness, the sea and land pours in abundance on every side. The whole creation as it were traveleth in pain, to minister unto their luxury and ease: every virtue, every duty, every obligation, devolving on them to perform, appear in their view to be comprized and fully summed up in one single points: posses∣sion of wealth!</P>
<P>IDLENESS frequently renders the soul dead to every virtue, but alive and fully active in every vice. Pests of society indeed! stagnating waters are not more pernicious in the natural world; than idle persons in the moral.</P>

The play-house, that nur∣sery of sin! that hot bed of vice! where those exotic phrases, customs, principles, habits and irregularities, are sheltered, sown, take root, flourish, are disseminated, transplanted, and spread through society, and receive a public countenance and protection, which otherwise could not in America, at present be obtained:—to the great promotion of dishonesty, neglect of business, ex∣travagance, idleness, hypocrisy, and almost every impropriety and corruption of good principles in youth; proves at best, to those who are ad∣vanced in life, a corrupt source of bad exam∣ples, occasioning frequent breaches of good hours, and a neglect of necessary concerns and important duties, both of a public and private nature; and therefore may be justly considered, without any undue prejudice, as an effect of idleness and luxu∣ry; incompatible with christianity, and highly pernicious in any well ordered society.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="033464_0031_0FF68051339E1898"/>THE present dispensation serves to shew in the clearest point of view, the baleful effects of idle∣ness in many of its consequences; and that it has been a mean of drawing down the divine displea∣sure upon this City.</P>
<P>MAY all be persuaded to a sense and practice of duty! life is short—its concerns weighty—its du∣ties many and various. The idle person is a blank or something worse in creation. May the fire of this dispensation purify us from idleness, that rust and canker of soul and body.</P>

<HEAD>INTEMPERANCE.</HEAD>
<P>INTEMPERANCE, comprehending (to speak in plain terms) gluttony and drunkenness and excess of all kinds in general, does at all times, and in all places tend very evidently to the destruction of man, soul and body!</P>
<P>THE scripture saith, "Woe to the drunkards of Ephraim!"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah. xxviii. 1.</NOTE> and may it not be added? "Woe to the drunkards of Philadelphia." Solomon saith, "The drunkard and the glutton shall come to po∣verty."<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxiii. 21.</NOTE> And in another place, "Who hath woe? Who hath sorrow? Who hath contentions?

of many sins are aimed at others in the first instance, and only ultimately or collaterally fall upon the perpetrators: but the intemperate person, turns a whole train of evils directly upon himself, that only affect others in an indirect or accidental way and manner. Therefore the in∣temperate person may be truly said to be his own worst enemy; destroying with his own hands the greatest blessing he can possibly enjoy, of a tem∣poral nature, health; and exposes the soul, that immortal part, in the most direct manner to ever∣lasting destruction. Are not the gales of life sufficiently brisk? Are the gentle breezes of health too long uninterrupted by the storms and hurricanes of sickness and trouble? Is the passage to eternity likely to prove too short? that such multitudes eagerly plunge into that all destructive and overwhelming vortex, intemperance.</P>
<P>THIS dispensation, the Yellow Fever, has cal∣led the drunkard and the glutton to a very severe account; many, of this description, may be truly compared to vessels of wrath fitted for destruction. And what renders it the more to be lamented, is, that it is done by themselves not ignorantly (if that were the case, they would be more pitiable objects) but knowingly, willingly, and witting∣ly.</P>
<P>LET the drunkard and the glutton, who have survived: and the intemperate of every descripti∣on; be warned, solemnly warned, I speedily, ere

which he also stiles "the root of all evil;"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. vi. 10.</NOTE> has had no inconsiderable share in contributing to our very distressed situation.</P>
<P>COVETOUSNESS has intruded upon, and marred, and much injured the original plan of the first founder of this City, the truly honourable WIL∣LIAM PENN.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to his design, (if I am rightly in∣formed) no buildings were to be erected between Front street and the River Delaware. But covet∣ousness, regardless of the beauty—the conveni∣ence—the natural order—and health of the city; has crowded buildings in a manner, that is incon∣venient for business, and destructive to the inha∣bitants.—And viewing this matter in a natural light only, and extending our views no farther than the surface of things.—It would, I believe be a great benefit to this city, if every building of the above description were entirely removed: and the vacancy supplied by one or two ranges of low and wide stores intersected with rows of trees.— And paved or graveled walks. By such or simi∣lar arrangements; The intense heat of a Summer's Meridian sun: its reflected sultry rays at particu∣lar hours from the surface of the river: and cor∣rupted and stagnated air from confined and crowd∣ed houses, generally destitute of yards; toge∣ther with other inconveniences and disadvanta∣ges too many and too obvious to be particularly
<PB N="39" REF="033464_0037_0FF7409FA86F8830"/>
enmerated: would generally be removed, or greatly alleviated and avoided.</P>
<P>COVETOUSNESS, thus considered, has most essen∣tially combined, with other causes, to mar the beauty—injure the prosperity—and endanger the existence of the city.</P>
<P>AND here it may be observed, that the pestilence whether originating in natural, or moral causes, or both combined; has in its three fatal visitati∣ons: first made its appearance eastward of Front-street.</P>
<P>THESE effects of covetousness are difficult to obviate, perhaps impossible entirely to remove: I shall therefore endeavour to turn your attention to the effects of covetousness in points, if not less fatal, yet more remediable.</P>
<P>COVETOUSNESS, when it once gains an ascen∣dency in the mind, is one of the most dangerous vices: in proof of this, much might be produced from scripture and history, but I shall principally confine my observations to America in general, and Philadelphia in particular.</P>
<P>What but covetousness caused such unheard of cruelties to be committed upon the ancient inha∣bitants of South America? and let me ask what but covetousness caused so many of the original inhabitants of North America, at once, to lose their lands without receiving compensation, and their lives without giving provocation? is it not an indisputable fact, that some of the states ob∣tained
<PB N="40" REF="033464_0038_0FF74120FB1A2080"/>
their lands by robbery and murder? and to the disgrace of a free and enlightened nation; do not some of them continue to have their plan∣tations cultivated by slavery and oppression?</P>
<P>But amidst all the sorrows of my heart, it af∣fords me real satisfaction to observe that this state was free from this odious trait of covetousness, in its first settlement; and the numerous and be∣neficial charitable institutions, which in this ci∣ty, far exceed those of any other on the continent, stamp the liberality of the citizens, in the most conspicuous and durable characters. Under this view, may we not, in the language of scripture, say: if "the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God; and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the "the gospel of God?"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Peter, iv 17.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT if the monster covetousness stalks not in public, it lurks unseen in private: of too many individuals it may be said;</P>
<L>"Of all their views, the first and chief request,</L>
<L>"Of each, is to be richer than the rest."</L>
<P>WHICH extreme ardour, in the acquisition of riches, seems at variance with the oeconomy of providence. I appeal to every serious and atten∣tive observer of providential dispensations, in the natural and moral world;—if covetousness in a fa∣ther, does not frequently occasion prodigality in the son?</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="033464_0039_0FF740A9ADD73AC0"/>COVETOUSNESS often defeats its own purposes— grasping at all—it, eventually holds none. Has not covetousness in this city of late, too much taken the place of Industry in business?—Has not the use of banks been abused—artificial capitals (of short duration) created, imprudent in com∣mencement—perplexing in advancement—and ru∣inous in the end?</P>
<P>COVETOUSNESS, by this dispensation, is punish∣ed in all its branches. The apprentice lad, too closely confined, now enjoys a long vacation.— The avaricious landlord, perceives his rents de∣clining in magnitude and number.—With most, the means of acquisition are few; Those of dis∣bursement many.</P>
<P>Happy are those, who duly consider,</P>

<P>THE affairs of this world, necessarily, unavoid∣ably, engage much of men's attention, particularly in commercial cities; and without such an insti∣tution as the sabbath, the mind would be in dan∣ger of being entirely engrossed and overwhelmed in temporal pursuits; and some of the most im∣portant duties of christianity and morality neglect∣ed and entirely forgotten: Death unregarded, and a future state unthought of, and unprepared for.</P>
<P>IT will no doubt be readily assented to, by all considerate persons, that the sabbath has in this place heretofore been shamefully neglected and disregarded. The apostle Paul, exhorted the people in his day, to be careful in not forsaking the assembling together, as the manner of some was.</P>
<P>HERE permit me to ask, are there not many heads of families, and others, whose conduct should be exemplary, that seldom, if ever, attend any place of public worship? Surely in this city, where twelve or more of different religious deno∣minations meet separately, no person can plead excuse, when in health, for a general course of non-attendance, at some one of these places.</P>
<P>CAN those be said to spend the sabbath with propriety or real use, who keep it as a day of feasting, diversion, or amusement, either in town or country?</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="033464_0043_0FF740AFB81B0598"/>COMMON observation will justify me in saying, that the sabbath, nominally a holy, is with many by far the most unholy and ill spent day in the week. Oh, what mockery! what perversion of order! what monstrous ingratitude and impropri∣ety is exhibited on this day, (particularly set apart for divine worship.) The day is profaned by ma∣ny, of whom better things might reasonably be expected; things that tend to edification, not de∣struction.</P>
<P>ON this day, instead of humility, behold pride! instead of temperance, excess! instead of self examination, and deep searchings of heart, behold vain and unprofitable conversation, and light airy behaviour!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I think it an incumbent duty, here to mention the satisfac∣tion I have received in being an eye and ear witness at different times, and in various parts of this city, of the exemplary conduct of numbers of the Africans on the sabbath.

My brethren, these things ought not to be.</P>
<P>MAY that supreme being, who first instituted the sabbath, and since has commanded us expressly
<PB N="46" REF="033464_0044_0FF741322A0B9C60"/>
to keep it holy, have his anger, which has been kindled against the sabbath-breakers, appeased, by a seasonable and lasting reformation.</P>
<P>MY heart within me, is, in measure warmed with the love of God, which I feel at this time, flowing through my soul, towards all the inhabi∣tants of this city, of whatever denomination; and the travail and exercise of my spirit for them; is, that they may all be brought out of darkness into light; and from the service of sin and satan unto the true worship of the living God: and that we may keep our sabbaths here below, in such a manner, that we may be permitted to see good days, accord∣ing to the days wherein we have seen evil; and, that finally, we may be admitted to keep that sab∣bath of rest with the Almighty, which the spirits of the just enjoy with him, in his kingdom for ever.</P>
<P>I WISH to enforce this subject upon your minds with every degree of weight, that its nature and importance requires: Being convinced in my own mind, that if, in future, sabbaths are remembered and sanctified, throughout the city, it will have a powerful tendency to correct vice—establish virtue—and thereby procure the divine favour: that so, an all powerful and kind providential care, may watch over this city, and all its widely extended concerns— for preservation, not destruc∣tion!</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="033464_0045_0FF740B7362D3F58"/>BUT on the other hand, if no reformation takes place, my foreboding apprehensions suggest, that what we have seen, felt and suffered, are only the beginning of sorrows.</P>

<HEAD>NEGLECT OF EDUCATION.</HEAD>
<P>A DEEP concern for the temporal and spiritual welfare, of the young and rising generation, has long dwelt with great weight upon my mind; and I have anxiously desired that they might be a gene∣ration to serve the Lord. A generation worthy to come forward in a country possessed of so many natural and acquired advantages!</P>
<P>BUT alas! until they see less of bad examples— are more restricted from reading pernicious books —kept at a greater distance from improper associ∣ates—and are brought to submit to a stricter dis∣cipline. What well grounded hopes can reason∣ably be entertained for their welfare?</P>
<P>THE neglect of parents and others, in these important respects, have, I believe, essentially con∣tributed to the present calamity; and a sense of these fatal neglects, has by this dispensation, been brought home to the feelings and conscience of many an unhappy parent, when on a dying bed, taking a long, an heart rending farewell of their weeping offspring; or viewing a much beloved child, under all the inexpressible horrors, of this most dreadful of all disorders! encircled in
<PB N="48" REF="033464_0046_0FF74139B0700A28"/>
the icy arms, and cold embraces of approaching death!</P>
<P>ON the reverse, where education has been strictly attended to, and the parent's duty faith∣fully discharged, there has been an answer of peace in these trying moments, which not all the wealth of the Indies could give, nor all the hor∣rors of death take away.</P>
<P>WHEREFORE, let all such parents as are spared to their children: and have children continued unto them; be tenderly entreated to be more at∣tentive to this important point, education.

<HEAD>BAD BOOKS.</HEAD>
<P>IT is much to be lamented, that so noble, so ingenious, and so universally useful an art as print∣ing, should ever be so debased, as, in any instance, to become an engine destructive of mankind, and a powerful auxiliary to the cause of vice. But the experience of past and present times, in too ma∣ny
<PB N="49" REF="033464_0047_0FF740B8C060E0C8"/>
instances, prove the press may be prostituted to very unworthy purposes, particularly printing bad books.</P>
<P>THE avenues of education and instruction, are often obstructed and corrupted by reason of bad books, by their means the attention of youth is forcibly attracted, and intensely fixed upon frivo∣lous, and often upon very improper and pernici∣ous objects and narrations. Whereby the worst of impressions and principles are frequently rivet∣ted in their young and tender minds: And their lively imaginations, fired with premature ideas, and false notions of men and things: Therefore may it be truly said.—"Bad Books are a public fountain of vice."</P>
<P>SCRIPTURE informs us, the Apostle Paul wrought so great a conviction, at a certain time, on the minds of the Ephesians; That many of them, "which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts, xix. 19.</NOTE></P>
<P>IF all the vain, wicked and unprofitable books in this city, were collected into one place, the bulk would doubtless be astonishingly great, could all their pernicious contents be seen at once, no mind not callous to the feelings of virtue; but would be filled with horror:—But ah! could all their fatal effects; as disobedience to parents—
<PB N="50" REF="033464_0048_0FF7413D9F0B24C0"/>
debaucheries—prostitutions—broken promises— perjuries—adulteries—suicides and other crimes too horrid to name, and all the souls eventually lost, caused by learning in, and inculcated from this abominable library of hell, be fully known:— not an arm, in the city, would remain a moment unstretched to light the funeral pile of departing vice: And the curling clouds of the rising co∣lumns of smoke would ascend towards heaven, as an acceptable sin offering from the inhabitants of Philadelphia.</P>
<P>IF prudent parents are cautious (as they cer∣tainly ought to be) in respect of what, company they admit in their families, as intimate acquain∣tances:—how much more caution is, necessary with regard to books?</P>
<P>IN conversation many circumstances serve to repress and abash vicious dispositions and inclinati∣ons. In reading none. The most pernicious books are generally read with the greatest secresy: not a blush raised at any impropriety of expression: nor perhaps a thought excited, or alarmed with a sense of danger; while the most intimate and destructive connections are forming by means of books: between wicked and designing authors; and innocent and unsuspecting youth.</P>
<P>Is it not an incumbent duty upon every per∣son; capable of serious reflection, to inspect their own books; and those of their dependants: and to burn and entirely destroy all such as tend to cor∣rupt
<PB N="51" REF="033464_0049_0FF7416D4DA0BD30"/>
good morals: and to lead the mind astray from the paths of innocence, rectitude, and virtue: and to suffer, upon no pretence whatever, any book to remain, or, ever after to be introduced, that may be found inconsistent with the purest morals, and the strictest reformation; that now seems so evidently necessary to take place?</P>
<P>REMEMBER I beseech you, how, that in Jo∣shua's time, the secreting a wedge of gold, some silver, and a Babylonish garment; brought trou∣ble upon the children of Israel; and proved the entire destruction of one of its families.</P>
<P>OH! that one and all of us, may be induced from the best of motives, to unite in so laudable an undertaking, as that of effectually clearing this city of bad books; if rightly undertaken, God will no doubt, in mercy to the rising generation, crown every honest effort with desired success.</P>

<HEAD>MOCKERY OF RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>OR open declaration of war with heaven, has been attempted, and in some measure carried on, in every age of the world: but, it never finally prospered, nor ever will eventually prevail.</P>
<P>PERHAPS, at no time, were the essential princi∣ples of natural and revealed religion, more gene∣rally attacked throughout the world; than at the present day. Some, by attempting to do away real or supposed errors, confound, right and
<PB N="52" REF="033464_0050_0FF741460322E310"/>
wrong—truth and falsehood in one blended and undistinguished overthrow: instead of mending, destroy—instead of correcting, obliterate: And with the tares pluck up the wheat. Others with∣out ceremony, openly and directly attack and de∣ny all revealed religion.—The scriptures, they pretend, are a mere farce, a human invention, much of them political fables, calculated to keep the ignorant and vulgar in awe; assuming to them∣selves the privilege of being numbered with the enlightened few, who have discovered the cheat. With some, (as they pretend) God is nothing but a name; Christ a mere man; Heaven, only an imaginary good; and Hell, a fictitious evil.</P>
<P>THESE opinions, whatever plausible pretexts some of them may assume, are, as they relate to man in this world, directly pointed against all government, all social compact, all that tends to render life desirable, or even supportable. As to a future state, these all destructive principles ren∣der it a chaos, o'er which broods more than Egypt∣ian darkness: Annihilation! mental destruction! to cease to be! are prospects more terrific, to the immortal mind forever active, and the rolling eye enjoying the golden day, than all the most gloomy imagination can paint, or the warmest enthusiasm believe of shades below.</P>
<P>AGAINST such principles, hostile to human hap∣piness in every view, every wise, every good man, feels at once opposed. The politician views them
<PB N="53" REF="033464_0051_0FF7417116093C40"/>
as a devouring hydra, before which, no govern∣ment can stand; and the moralist and the chris∣tian view them as productive of every present and future woe.</P>
<P>PRINCIPLES like these, wicked fools alone ad∣vance, advocate, or pretend to believe!</P>
<P>BUT however great my partiality and charity for this city may be, I am persuaded they would be extended too far, if I should suppose it entirely free from such principles, however inconsistent with wisdom, goodness, or common honesty.</P>
<P>TO such persons, few, I hope, in number, as dangerous in sentiment, what can be addressed with any prospect of success? God's own power, immediately, or man's good examples, instrument∣ally, seem the only remedies, in cases so despe∣rate.</P>
<P>GOD's power so signally displayed, at this time, both in mercy and judgment, in preserving and destroying—in obscuring the world in all its glo∣ry—in withdrawing its pleasures and advantages, in so great a degree, from its principal votaries and dependants, has occasioned the atheist the deist, and the unbelievers of all descriptions, to experience sad times! gloomy days! and great remorse! Conscience in many has been aroused! The wrath of Almighty God, and the terrors of his judgments, have brought conviction home to the minds of many; under which they have been
<PB N="54" REF="033464_0052_0FF7414BD6208148"/>
made to cry out, Lord, save me, or I diet! A re∣deemer, or I perish!</P>
<P>THE mind of man, ever active in the pursuit of happiness, when disappointed in one object, naturally turns to another; as saith an eminent poet:</P>
<L>"Man has a soul of vast desires;</L>
<L>He burns within with restless fires,</L>
<L>Toss'd to and fro, his passions fly,</L>
<L>From vanity to vanity."</L>
<P>AND after a long and unsuccessful pursuit, not satisfied with all this world can bestow, in this dark and bewildered situation, the bright rays of good examples, at times strike through the sur∣rounding gloom, the mind is attracted to the glory of the light, and the brightness of its rising: On nearer survey, he is astonished to find, that while he has been unhappy in prosperity and adversity, the christian enjoys happiness in both: that what he has been seeking from without, the christian finds within; that, while from the most unbound∣ed success in war, (which engrosses to much of our attention) lasting, individual, or national hap∣piness can never arise: that, while wealth, how∣ever immense, cannot give peace; nor universal fame and applause, bestow real content. The good man has a world within, where God rules (the devil seldom enters); where politics, wealth and fame, are merely accidental matters, not
<PB N="55" REF="033464_0053_0FF7417630F81A30"/>
having the highest pre-eminence; happiness or mi∣sery, depend on them in a subordinate manner only.</P>
<P>FROM a feeling of the judgments of God—from an experience of the vanity of the world, its in∣sufficiency to bestow lasting happiness—from be∣holding the dignity of virtue, and seeing the good man happy in every situation—many are at times brought into a state of inward attention and con∣sideration, which, if abode in, with patience and perseverance, would be the means, by the blessing of God, of bringing those, who are thus exercised, out of darkness into light; out of anxiety and dis∣content, into peace, and a well grounded hope of future happiness.</P>
<P>IF unbelievers can receive instruction from the examples of good men, in their lives, they may not be altogether unbenefited by attending to their deaths.</P>
<P>IT is the end that crowns all; and where a man is seen calmly quiting every earthly connection— passing the verge of time—entering on the borders of eternity—satisfied with life—unmoved at death! it appears to all a consummation devoutly to be wished; and many are ready to adopt the langu∣age of Balaam, "Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Numb. xxiii. 10.</NOTE></P>
<P>SOME infidels, who do not openly deny all re∣vealed religion, yet by their conduct, seem to
<PB N="56" REF="033464_0054_0FF7414D7AFC6338"/>
entertain a thorough contempt and disregard of its professors. This, no doubt, is highly dis∣pleasing in the sight of God.</P>
<P>WE frequently see and hear that the rulers of the earth, when their ambassadors, their envoys extraordinary, their subjects or citizens, are treat∣ed with abuse, contempt, or neglect, in a foreign land, denounce the vengeance of the state, unless reparation for the offence is made. An insult to an individual is often viewed as offered immediate∣ly to the majesty of the nation: War sometimes ensues, and thousands, comprehending the inno∣cent and guilty, are often involved in one undis∣tinguished ruin.</P>
<P>IF earthly potentates are so jealous of matters concerning honour and respect, whether relating immediately to themselves, or those under their direction and government, can we suppose the supreme ruler of the universe, possessing all know∣ledge and power, to be an idle spectator, and wholly indifferent about the manner in which his messengers are received—his servants treated— and his communications attended to and obeyed?</P>
<P>MOST individuals and most communities have a day; wherein happiness, in its most extensive sense, may be obtained. Adam had a day—but not being sufficiently attentive he suffered loss.— The old world, had their day, but they neglected it:—Among them, was Noah, a preacher of righte∣ousness, but he was disregarded; they were too
<PB N="57" REF="033464_0055_0FF7417800566918"/>
much immersed in temporal concerns; the earth was filled with violence: all flesh had corrupted his way—and destruction ensued. And although the Almighty covenanted with Noah and his poste∣rity, that so universal a destruction among man∣kind, by reason of a flood should not again take place: yet we have seen, and this day feel, that the Lord's arm is not shortened, either to save or destroy.</P>
<P>SODOM and Gomorrha had a day, but alas! it was neglected; till destruction came: though they had a Lot in the city to warn and reprove; and an Abraham in the country to intercede with Heaven. Oh how many reproving Lots, and in∣terceding Abrahams, have, day and night, in sea∣son and out of season, been employed for the sal∣vation of this city. Some of whom have been mocked and despised—pointed and jeered at, when walking the streets —and, all in effect have been but too much disregarded until calamity approached.</P>
<P>AHAB had a day, and although a very wicked King, surrounded by an idolatrous people—and his public and private concerns troubled with a cruel, meddlesome, unprincipalled woman: which stirred him up to do, what perhaps otherwise would not have been done: Yet when the Lord reproved him by the mouth of his prophet, he did not mock at religion, nor despise his messen∣ger; (though he counted him for an enemy) but
<PB N="58" REF="033464_0056_0FF7415115F72B40"/>
he humbled himself before God, and his doom was suspended.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants of Ninevah had a day of g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace assigned unto them: and by attending thereto in earnest—by an universal humiliation—fervent prayer to Almighty God—and a thorough repen∣tance and reformation—the anger of the most high was appeased—and his righteous judgments not inflicted.</P>
<P>THE Jews had a day, a long day of grace, but they never fully improved it. They were divided into different sects; some Pharisees; some Sad∣ducees; others perhaps, of no particular denomi∣nation, but mockers at any appearanc of religion. Most were too much outward in their perfor∣mances, and few sincere at heart in the sight of God: They, as a city, as a nation, withstood the law and the prophets: the Son and sent of God, came personally unto them; but they received him not: they mocked and persecuted both him and the religion he came to establish; which brought upon them and their city, a destruction attended with circumstances unparralleled in history, anci∣ent or modern, sacred or profane.</P>
<P>A PROSPECT of which, brought from the com∣pasionate and ever blessed Son of God and saviour of the world, that pathetic exclamation and dread∣ful denunciation, "Oh, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I

<P>THESE things, my afflicted brethren of Phila∣delphia, were written for warnings and examples to us, and now, in my measure of that love, that wisheth well to all men, are endeavoured to be revived in your remembrance.</P>
<P>MAY God of his infinite mercy, through Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour, grant that these things may be received in the love of the truth: That all, who have heretofore been mockers of religion, may be convinced of their folly and dan∣ger, and turn from their evil ways; lest they should experience from God, what is spoken of by the wise man Solomon, "Because I have call∣ed and ye have refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regardeth; but ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof; I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh. When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction com∣eth as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you; then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me: For that they hated know∣ledge,

Punishments are preceded by warnings and exhortations. Sin, when unrestrained by pu∣nishment, is of such a nature; as, of itself to de∣stroy mankind.

<P>A GREAT work of reformation, I hope, and believe is, bringing about by the various permissi∣ons and dispensations of divine providence at the present day.</P>
<P>JUDGMENTS are sometimes varied according to the sins and circumstances of those upon whom they are inflicted.

<P>BUT the inhabitants of this city, are many of them peaceable men; professing to stand aloof from war, and being concerned in the destruction
<PB N="64" REF="033464_0062_0FF680724E5A7BF8"/>
of their fellow men:—pacific principles, by rea∣son of their advocates intermixing with their fel∣low citizens, upon many local interesting occasi∣ons; and thereby in conjunction with the great diffusion of knowledge, and the improved civili∣zation of the present day have insensibly infused general principles of peace, with some exceptions, into the mass of society. The citizens, therefore, speaking in general terms; may be called pacific in many of their principles, and most of their practices; their sins may be considered, as com∣mitted more directly against God, and their own souls and bodies; than against the lives and pro∣perties of their neighbours.</P>
<P>THE punishment therefore of these transgressi∣ons seem to proceed directly from God, and to be confined in a manner to the city: with a hap∣py tendency when improved aright, to enforce the observance of those duties, which have been neg∣lected, and the practice of those virtues, that stand opposed to the sins and vices, which have been most prevalent.</P>
<P>THUS humility, as opposed to pride: industry, instead of idleness, the illustrious train attendant on temperance, instead of the frightful group sur∣rounding excess—instead of profaneness, sobriety— liberality instead of covetousness—instead of in∣justice, honesty—sabbaths sanctified, instead of broken—Children taught by virtuous examples, and proper discipline, instead of a vitiated and

neglected education—instead of reading bad books, a more frequent use of the scriptures, and a peru∣sal of edifying subjects—instead of mocking and ridiculing religion and its author, a devotion to them above all things—and instead of unthankful∣ness to God, and disregard of his judgments, lives entirely devoted to his service and praise: and a religious dread of again incurring his righteous indignation are virtues, reformations, and bene∣fits, pressed, enjoined, and conferred, by this dis∣pensation, upon us, and by us, as examples, to and upon mankind; in a language, though dumb, eloquent—mute yet expressive—silent but positive— far beyond all powers of the elocution of angels or men; being the immediate voice of God him∣self!</P>

view it in its nature or effect; in its cause or im∣mediate consequence, our enquiries will result in this:—<HI>That God has been angry with the inhabit∣ants of Philadelphia, for their sins; and by this third visitation of the plague, has, as it were by his imme∣diate voice from Heaven, warned those who survive, to repentance, in a more direct and solemn manner, than any other city on this continent has ever experi∣enced, since its settlement by Europeans.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">According to official returns, on 9th mo. (September) 28th, 106 persons died—which, considering the very few inhabitants remaining in the city, perhaps not one tenth part of what re∣mained in 1793, may be accounted the greatest mortality ever known, by Americans, in this country.</NOTE></P>
<P>IF repentance does not succeed this judgment, can we suppose it will not be renewed? perhaps with tenfold vengeance! REFORMATION OR DESTRUCTION! TURN OR DIE! is, I be∣lieve, the emphatical language of heaven, to us, at this time!</P>
<P>GOD has clearly pointed out to the inhabitants of this city, their duty: Neither the means of knowledge, nor knowledge itself is wanting. He has favoured us with his written word and holy Spirit; all that is wanting is a heart to fear and obey the Lord.</P>
<P>OUR heavenly Father has not been inattentive to our salvation—to allure us into the pleasing paths of virtue—to deter us from the dangerous avenues of vice—he has, in the one hand, held out every blessing; in the other, every woe—in
<PB N="67" REF="033464_0065_0FF7418EF72F1728"/>
the one, all prosperity; in the other, every ad∣versity—in the one, blooming joy; in the other, wan despair!</P>
<P>AROUND him, in thronged succession wait, im∣patient to know and obey his will, dread minis∣ters of heaven, armed with every element, every power! to reward or punish—save or destroy.</P>
<P>IF the pestilence is not heard! if the language of the plague is not understood! will it not be repeated? or something more arousing to refor∣mation! Something more sudden in attack! more alarming and universal in execution!</P>

<P>SWIFTLY descending, urged on, and fiercely driven by some serenely indignant seraph, borne in awful sublimity of state, on whirling wings, of Northern airy forces—sweeping with impetuous deluging tempests—charged with incessant peals of the deepest toned thunder—preceded by widely ex∣panded sheets and streams of heaven's avenging flashes of vivid lightning—before which the lofty spires bend— airy turrets bow—human grandeur lays low—and the effects of sin and sinners, com∣pose one general ruin!

— armed in dread vengeance with insatiable thirst for despotic power, and human blood! Led by unbounded ambition to gain universal empire and dominion, should assail our borders by land and water, in one day, and with every cruelty and every horror; planned in hell, or done on earth —destroy men, women and children, and razing the buildings to their foundations, not leaving one stone upon another; and in the centre of its desolation erect a monument with this inscription, as a warning to mankind, in all succeeding ages, against sin:</P>

<HEAD>HERE PHILADELPHIA STOOD.</HEAD>
<P>UNDER the assault of one of these judgments, or some, or all of them united, the once famed city Philadelphia, being</P>
<L>"Like an exile, from a father's care,</L>
<L>Deliver'd o'er to darkness and despair."</L>
<P>PERHAPS may be viewed by some sympathizing friend, standing at a distance, in an agony of des∣pair, uttering a language, somewhat after this manner:</P>
<P>"OH Philadelphia! thou that hast passed through to many dispensations of mercy and judg∣ment, would to God thou hadst known, even thou in thy day the things that belonged to thy peace; but now they are forever hid from thine eyes."</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="033464_0068_0FF74166ABCDCA78"/>BUT, if no general, no lasting reformation should prevail, and none of the judgments men∣tioned should follow, much as pestilence, fire, deluges, hurricanes, earthquakes, war, and other calamities similar unto them, are to be dreaded: Yet there remains one judgment unmentioned, more to be feared than all the others, separately or jointly considered: I mean a being left of God to ourselves.</P>
<P>WRETCHED indeed! is that individual, or that community, whose sins are suffered to pass long unpunished, without repentance! Though the world and all around may seem to smile, and every thing for the present appear agreeable, yet sooner or later, it will be found an important and interesting truth, that while sin remains unreform∣ed, and unrepented of, and the heart undevoted to, and estranged from God, we are in that broad way which leads to destruction; the breadth and smoothness whereof, and the numbers and gaiety of those who are passing therein, will make but poor amends for the final destructive consequences that will inevitably ensue.</P>
<P>OH! saith my soul, and all that is living within me, let none put off the necessary, the All im∣portant work of repentance and reformation, to what they may vainly suppose a convenient season! The call for instant and effectual attention to these duties, is pressing beyond expression.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="033464_0069_0FF741912C273518"/>AS being in the immediate presence of my Maker, and, I trust, under the influence and di∣rection of his Holy Spirit, I feel it my indispen∣sible duty, at this time, and in this way, most solemnly to declare it to be my clear and full be∣lief, that this city, if not reformed, will in all probability, eventually be destroyed.</P>
<P>EMBRACING, in the arms of faith and love, every individual inhabitant of this extensive city, and humbly prostrating before the throne of divine grace, with the deepest awe, and most profound veneration, my soul breathes forth fervent suppli∣cations to the most high! that he would gracious∣ly be pleased, to enable us all to examine our ways and doings, and in the goodness and abund∣ance of his infinite mercy, for the sake of his dear Son our blessed saviour and redeemer, assist us in every needful time, to repent and reform of what∣ever we have done amiss; that so, we may be received into his favour, and all tokens of his dis∣pleasure, in future, be averted; and the prospe∣rity and happiness of this our beloved city, be placed and secured upon that only sure foundation, acceptance with God, through Jesus Christ.</P>
