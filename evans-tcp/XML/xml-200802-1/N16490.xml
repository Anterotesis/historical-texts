<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE different inclinations, employ∣ments, and amusements which engage the attention of boys and girls, suggested to the Author of the following trifling performance, that such a design might not be useless to fill up those intervals of leisure, which may occur to the former from their more important studies. With this view therefore, it is now submitted to the candour of publick inspection, trust∣ing for a favourable reception, more to the utility of the plan than the merit of its execution. The indulgent attention with which the Adventures of a Pincush∣ion has been honoured, flattered the writer with an opinion, that a work like the present might meet with equal success; as the aim in both has been to promote the cause of</HI> virtue, <HI>and to blend the hints of instruction with incidents of an a∣musing
<PB N="8" REF="021188_0004_0FB29E96D915D830"/>
nature. The former work was designed chiefly for the use of young La∣dies, this is evidently calculated for young Gentlemen: For although the laws of justice, probity and truth, are of</HI> gen∣eral <HI>obligation, yet it was imagined, that by consulting</HI> different amusements <HI>and</HI> pursuits, <HI>and recommending the accom∣plishments</HI> separately, <HI>in which each sex were more particularly concerned, the subjects would become more interesting to those readers to whom they were im∣mediately addressed, and have, in conse∣quence, a better chance for approbation.</HI></P>

<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF A PEGTOP.</HEAD>
<P>AS I have heard that a <HI>Pincushion,</HI> a <HI>Dog,</HI> a <HI>Halfpenny,</HI> and a <HI>Bank Note</HI> have each written a history of their adventures, I thought to myself one morning, when I was left upon a writing desk, that it would be a convenient opportunity for me to immitate such examples, and that the memoirs of a <HI>Pegtop</HI> might prove equally entertaining with any of the be∣forementioned histories. So resolving to re∣collect the various scenes I had passed through, I determined to present <HI>my adventures</HI> likewise to the world, and share in the fame of those Authors, who had bestowed their labours to immortalize a particular animal or toy, while the rest of their species were consigned to neg∣lect or oblivion.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="021188_0006_0FB29E9A1DB71610"/>
I was completed, gentle reader, into my present form on a <HI>Friday</HI> morning, and survey∣ed with great satisfaction by the workman who had accomplished me, as the best top he had ever produced. In the afternoon of the same day he carried me, with a number of my brethren, to a large toy shop in <HI>Boston;</HI> where I was presented to the master; and after be∣ing examined, and having received great com∣mendation from the mechanick who brought me thither, was tossed, with very little ceremony into a large drawer with the companions who had accompanied me, and some whom I never before saw. As we were all <HI>new,</HI> and had not as yet seen any thing beyond our present abode, and the bag in which we were convey∣ed to it, we remained extremely silent and re∣served; for you must allow me the privilege of supposing, I can make known my sentiments to other inanimate substances, though I have not the powers of articulation; as in effect if you can imagine a top to be capable of <HI>writing</HI> and <HI>composition,</HI> there will remain little difficulty in granting to it the licence of speech; all
<PB N="11" REF="021188_0007_0FB29E9B4AC63978"/>
these talents being entirely inconsistent with truth and reality, but may be allowed to exist by the force of imagination. Thus far having premised, as a necessary preliminary to my his∣tory, I shall continue to inform you, that we had very little conversation with each other. A few indeed wished to make their escape from this place of confinement; and a poor top who had a piece broken off from one of its sides, very pathetically lamented, that it had seen three drawers full disposed of, while it had lain al∣ways neglected on this account, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had been rolled out on the counter, and taken up as of∣ten as any purchaser appeared; and although offered to sale for <HI>half</HI> the price of its compan∣ions, had been tossed back with contempt, and was likely to remain in that situation for∣ever. I felt a great degree of sympathy for this unfortunate brother, and was just going to express my pity for his condition, when the drawer which contained us, was suddenly pull∣ed out, and a very genteel lady selected some of us to present to a little boy in scarlet clothes,
<PB N="12" REF="021188_0008_0FB29E9CC13B27B0"/>
who appeared to be about ten years old. The youth, however, desired leave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> chuse for himself, telling the lady, whom he called
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
mamma, that she did not understand which would be a good <HI>spinner:</HI> after handling almost all that he saw, he selected <HI>me</HI> as the best of the whole collection. The lady paid the price which was asked for me, and I was put into master's pocket, who walked off, not a little pleased with his purchase.</P>
<P>When we reached the house he was going to which was a handsome building in <HI>Summer
<PB N="13" REF="021188_0009_0FB29E9F8C52E458"/>
Street,</HI> he took me out to shew to another child in petticoats, who cried sadly to possess me; but was told by his mamma, that I was his brother's property, and that <HI>Henry</HI> must keep me, because, on <HI>Monday</HI> he was going to a <HI>boarding school.</HI> Some company soon af∣ter coming into the apartment, the lady de∣sired her son to take care of me until a more convenient opportunity.</P>
<P>I soon found by their conversation, my new master had been brought up with great tender∣ness by his mother, who was a widow; and was to go to school on the day abovementioned for the first time. That a great number of toys had been purchased to allure him into this measure, and to sooth his sorrows at the thoughts of a separation.</P>
<P>As he had no opportunity to play with me the remainder of the evening. I lay snug in his pocket until he went to bed: when he took me out, and expatiated to a footman, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to undress, on the pleasure he should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> himself <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> wished
<PB N="14" REF="021188_0010_0FB29EA199CF6048"/>
the next day had not been <HI>Sunday,</HI> as it would prevent his enjoyment. This was certainly a fault, but he was very young and inconsiderate; and it is to be hoped, that when he grew older he acquired more wisdom. The next day he did not <HI>play</HI> with me indeed; but he took me out of his pocket a great number of times to look at; and even while he was at church (which was highly blameable) felt, to know if I was secure: A proof he was but too inatten∣tive to his employment. But greatly as I had been favoured by his notice, the time was now come when I was to experience his entire neglect.</P>
<P>His mother, who had cautiously avoided the mention of his departure, in the evening pressed his hand with some emotion, and told him, she hoped that now he was going to a distance from her instructions, he would not forget what she had taken such pains to incul∣cate. I am afraid, my dear <HI>Henry,</HI> added she, wiping her eyes, as if some dust had flown into them, though in reality to clear them from
<PB N="15" REF="021188_0011_0FB29EA3826E0A30"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
those tears she could not restrain, I am sadly afraid, that when you have left home, you will pay but little attention to those admoni∣tions which you have hitherto so much regard∣ed. There may, amongst the number of boys you will meet with at the large school to which you are going, be some, who will wickedly laugh at your observance of those duties, which I flatter myself, you will always continue to respect. But remember there are some obliga∣tions, my dear boy, which nothing on earth
<PB N="16" REF="021188_0012_0FB29EA66E455A28"/>
can dispense with. Among these is a strict re∣gard to truth and sincerity. However your interest may lead you so the commission of de∣ceit, be assured you will reap no fruit from its indulgence; but remorse in your own mind, and contempt from every one around you. If you are guilty of a fault, let me persuade you, rather to submit to the punishment which it deserves (and which may be often mitigated by an honest confession) than to endeavour to con∣ceal it by a lie. You have always hitherto been above the commission of such an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> meanness, and I only design to caution you now, because you will be exposed to those temp∣tations from which I have ever been careful to secure you. I trust likewise that you will be assiduous to cultivate a peaceable and kind dis∣position; for however <HI>fighting</HI> and <HI>revenge</HI> may be wrongly accounted the marks of <HI>spirit,</HI> be∣lieve me, that <HI>true courage</HI> can never consist <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a willingness to <HI>offend,</HI> or a captious inclination to be displeased. These maxims which you have hitherto been taught to reverence, will
<PB N="17" REF="021188_0013_0FB29EA782498688"/>
perhaps be derided by your schoolfellows, as the weak advice of a <HI>mother,</HI> who can know nothing of <HI>boyish</HI> contentions. But I trust, that you, my son, whose affection for that mother is undoubted, will not so ill repay my solici∣tude as to despise these instructions when you are at a distance from my embraces. Be as∣sured that I am your <HI>best friend,</HI> and would never desire you to do, or forbear any thing, which will tend to make you beloved and re∣spected. <HI>Henry,</HI> who had been holding me in his hand without any design of playing, from the time his mother began her discourse; but had merely been rubbing me about with his fingers, now laid me hastily on the table, and throwing his arms round her, sobbed forth an assent to her advice; assuring her, that he would never forget her admonition, and that he loved her too well to disobey them: while the lady, overcome by her son's emotion, joined her tears to his, and embraced him with an equal ardour of tenderness and affection. As

to your learning, said she, after a pause, I am persuaded that emulation, and desire to equal, if not exceed your companions, will inspire you with application; and I shall be much dis∣appointed to hear you are remiss in that article. I hope, that without considering it as a task, your affection will dispose you to write fre∣quently to me, as you well know nothing can give me equal pleasure. The young gentleman was here summoned to supper, and left me on the table, from which place I was not remov∣ed
<PB N="19" REF="021188_0015_0FB29EAA405E67F8"/>
until the next morning, when a servant hasti∣ly carried me down stairs to my master, who was in a post chaise with two gentlemen, and who put me with a melancholy air into his pocket. I shall not detain my readers with any account of our journey, or the reception he met with from Mr. <HI>Verber,</HI> the person who kept the school; but proceed to inform them, that Master <HI>Henry</HI> was conducted by this gentleman into the play yard, where he left him; telling him to amuse himself with his new companions. He wanted courage to advance, and had rather have retired to give vent to the affliction which he felt at a separation from his beloved mother (and the desertion of his uncles who had ac∣companied him) that lady having declined that office from a fear of increasing his distress. Some of the boys surveyed him in silence, and quietly marched off: the older ones took no no∣tice of a child so much their inferiour, and some of the young ones proclaimed the arrival of a <HI>new boy.</HI> with a noise to which he was quite un∣accustomed. Several however, whose diffidence
<PB N="20" REF="021188_0016_0FB29EABC04E79D8"/>
was seldom any restraint, accosted him with an enquiry after his name, family, and place of abode; and concluded with asking, in the tech∣nical term of the school, whether he had brought any <HI>prog.</HI> To this last question, as he really did not understand it, <HI>Henry</HI> returned no answer until it was explained to mean, whe∣ther he had any cakes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to dispose of. He replied in the affirmative; but his baggage was not in his possession, and therefore he could not satisfy their demand. At last, however, he took me from, his pocket, and was going to play with a greater degree of freedom than he had yet assumed, when, with some surprise, he heard the boys address him and each other by their <HI>sirname,</HI> without any distinction of <HI>Mas∣ter,</HI> or <HI>Sir,</HI> to which terms he had always been accustomed. He made this observation the next day to one of his playfellows, and was, in consequence of it, ridiculed with the ap∣pellation of <HI>Sir Master,</HI> an epithet which was intended to convey peculiar derision.</P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> soon found that his skill in spinning a
<PB N="21" REF="021188_0017_0FB29EB1AB39B068"/>
top, was greatly inferiour to his companions; and a great boy one day who liked my appear∣ance, told him, he would exchange tops with him, or offered to toss up for me, to which he ignorantly consented. A halfpenny was pro∣duced, and <HI>Henry</HI> twice called out <HI>heads,</HI> and it turning up the reverse, I was declared the property of <HI>Frank Powel,</HI> to the great disap∣pointment of my master, who did not like to resign me, and who had not understood the intention of the proposal; but wanted much to keep me in his possession. All the boys, however, being unanimous in the opinion, that matters had been fairly conducted, I was re∣luctantly delivered by poor <HI>Henry</HI> to a new owner. <HI>Powel</HI> was near fourteen, remarkably sprightly and active, and esteemed by his com∣panions one of the clevereth boys in the school. He surveyed me with great pleasure, and ran to a number of his playmates, who were play∣ing at pegtop in a circle. My master soon entered me in the list, and I was unfortunately so little acquainted with the game, that I did
<PB N="22" REF="021188_0018_0FB29EB4016FDBE0"/>
not understand how to extricate myself. I met here with two of my brethren, who informed me, that all our species who were introduced
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
into this fatal inclosure, would attempt to split us, and make their own escape: and I had a melancholy proof of the truth of this intelli∣gence in the very top who communicated it, as it immediately experienced the fate above∣mentioned; and, I saw with horror, one which belonged to my own master cleave it through the middle. The peg, which was a valuable
<PB N="23" REF="021188_0019_0FB29EB9C7454460"/>
one, as it was of ten <HI>acorns,</HI> was immediately declared to be his prize, and he took it up with an air of triumph and satisfaction. It is impossible to describe the uneasiness I felt at this spectacle, which was encreased when ano∣ther was thrown in, which approached so near as twice to assault my sides with great violence; the third time, however, effected my deliver∣ance, and drove me beyond the limits which had been marked for the contest. <HI>Powel</HI> snatch∣ed me up with an ardour of joy, and the bell ringing for supper, he hastened in doors, and devoted the rest of the time until he went to bed, to execute the task which Mr. <HI>Verber</HI> had allotted him.</P>
<P>The quick manner in which he dispatched, and the facility with which he comprehended his learning, gained him the favour of his mas∣ter, and excited the envy of his school fellows. But the constant good nature with which he behaved to them, inclined them at the same time to love and respect him. His invariable honour, and uncorrupted honestly had been so often dis∣tinguished,
<PB N="24" REF="021188_0020_0FB29EBC4E18F2A0"/>
that Mr. <HI>Verber</HI> deputed to his charge, the payment of their weekly allowance to about twenty boys. His commissions he had executed with universal credit and satisfaction; until one day, when <HI>Jack Growler,</HI> who was of a most wicked and malignant disposition, declar∣ed that he had been cheated, of sixpence, and that he would appeal to his master for redress.</P>
<P><HI>Powel.</HI> whose only fault was in general to be too passionate in the vindication of his conduct, disdained on the present occasion to answer the charge, and treated <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> with the most provoking contempt▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elling him, that he was welcome to make what complaints he pleased, since he neither scared <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cared for his accusation.</P>
<P>This behaviour inflamed <HI>Jack</HI> to much, that though he soon after found the money, which he had dropped when he received it, he was yet determined to be revenged; and both go∣ing up to shew their exercise to Mr. <HI>Verber</HI> at the same time, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the sixpence in deb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te▪ and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="25" REF="021188_0021_0FB29EC05833FBE0"/>
<HI>Frank's</HI> pocket, and soon after alledging, that when <HI>Powel</HI> had paid him nine pence, which
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
was the sum due to him, he had taken back the sixpence, and refused to restore it, de∣claring that he had paid the whole.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Verber</HI> immediately summoned the ac∣cused party to defend himself, who very warmly retorted upon <HI>Growler</HI> the charge of meanness, malice, and detraction, and declared that he had delivered him the whole; protesting in the most solemn manner, that he had never touch∣ed
<PB N="26" REF="021188_0022_0FB29EC215A9CE90"/>
or seen it since. His companions joined in this account, and confirmed it by saying, the money was as remarkable as I described. Upon which their master ordered them both to be searched, which afforded no small degree of pleasure to <HI>Growler,</HI> who first submitted to the command, and escaped with greater honour than fell to the share of the innocent <HI>Powel,</HI> in whose possession the sixpence was found. A∣mazed, confounded, and provoked to the high∣est degree at this unexpected accident, my poor master could not contain his indignation. He loudly repeated his protestations of innocence, and laid the blame of treachery and deceit with great justice on his accuser. But still appear∣ances were so much in his disfavour, that Mr. <HI>Verber</HI> sternly told him, his passions rising to such excess, was a confirmation of his guilt; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, that unless he could clear himself from the imputation, he must expect the severest pun∣ishment, as his crime appeared of the most com∣plicated nature; comprehending a charge of deceit, lying, and fraud; crimes of such mag∣nitude,
<PB N="27" REF="021188_0023_0FB29EC303143540"/>
as he never <HI>did,</HI> nor ever <HI>would</HI> pardon. He then ordered him to deliver up the money with which he had been intrusted, as he was not worthy the office of his secretary, until his character was cleared, and his innocence made manifest. He was likewise ordered to confine∣ment in a small room, which was called the Bas∣tile, because it had but one window, which was a sky light; and whoever was thought deserving this punishment, was banished from all the rest of his companions, and secluded from every amusement. All the toys which were found in his pocket were confiscated to Mr. <HI>Verber,</HI> who took me as part of that number, and deposited me in a drawer in his own study; where I remained in a state of quietness and in∣action for some time. The companions of my secluded state were a <HI>teatotum,</HI> which had been seized from a boy who spun it in school time when he ought to have been writing; a bag of <HI>marbles</HI> that had forfeited their liberty from their master's having rolled them on the seat of the pew at church; together with an
<PB N="28" REF="021188_0024_0FB29EC482B21FE0"/>
exceeding good <HI>ball,</HI> which had been thrown up against the house, and made its way through the parlour window; and a <HI>drum battledore,</HI> and curious <HI>shuttlecock,</HI> which the owner had used in school time, when he was dispatched on another errand; and which had prolonged his stay until Mr. <HI>Verber</HI> had discovered his em∣ployment. After some time this gentleman took me out, and presented me once more to his favourite <HI>Powel,</HI> whose character had been fully vindicated, as I soon learned; and who was now reinstated in his master's favour, and restored to his former distinction. With a smile of complacence, Mr. <HI>Verber</HI> gave me back to my master, and assured him, it was with the greatest pleasure he congratulated him on the complete manifestation of his innocence: at the same time, said he, I must blame you for that indiscreet warmth, with which on all oc∣casions, you are apt to defend yourself; and which will ever be an injury to the best cause; and, I assure you, more inclined me to ima∣gine you to be guilty, than any other argu∣ment
<PB N="29" REF="021188_0025_0FB29EC8C659D2F0"/>
could have done. Be convinced, <HI>Powel,</HI> that virtue can never be <HI>assisted,</HI> but may be often <HI>hurt</HI> by the indulgence of passion. How∣ever, I trust that you will have so much good sense as to improve from the consciousness of past failings; and I do insist upon your giving up all thoughts of personal revenge against your accuser, whose punishment I shall take into my own hands; and I hope that you are too gene∣rous to think of bearing future ill will and enmity against him, since the best way to prove your own superiority and merit, will be by a generous forgiveness; and I should be extreme∣ly sorry to be obliged, through your violence to him, to involve you in a similar condemna∣tion. <HI>Powel</HI> expressed his satisfaction at his master's approbation, and thanking him for the continuance of his confidence, with a low bow left the room.</P>
<P><HI>Jack Growler,</HI> as I afterwards found, had discovered his treachery, by boasting of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to one of his friends; and rejoicing in that plan of revenge, which had involved the
<PB N="30" REF="021188_0026_0FB29EC9CCF70FB0"/>
innocent <HI>Powel</HI> in disgrace. But being over∣heard by his master, he had punished his wick∣edness by a severe flogging, and obliged him publickly to ask pardon, and likewise for some weeks deprived him of his allowance, as that had been the instrument of malevolence. And indeed I have often had occasion to remark in the scenes in which I have been engaged, that however vice may triumph for a time, it is generally discovered in the end, and meets with its deserved retribution.</P>
<P>Soon after I was restored to my master, he went with four other boys (who had likewise obtained leave so to do) to a neighbouring vil∣lage, in order to purchase whipcord, ginger∣bread, marbles, and such other things as they wanted. Just as they set out for this purpose, <HI>Powel</HI> came behind one of the party, whose name was <HI>Tom Swallowell,</HI> tossed his handker∣chief over his head, and asked him how he should like to walk all the way blindfold? Why I should not mind it a straw, returned he, and could find the path, I warrant you, without any
<PB N="31" REF="021188_0027_0FB29ECB51CFB528"/>
assistance. I will lay you sixpence to be spent in cheesecakes, which we will buy of the old pye woman, said <HI>Powel,</HI> that you cannot go as far as the turnpike without assistance, if your eyes are bound up. Done! replied <HI>Tom,</HI> and I will bet you sixpence that I can! but you shall promise that you will not let me run into danger without telling me of it neither by going in the way of horses, or tumbling into a ditch. These articles agreed to, <HI>Swal∣lowell</HI> stood still while they bound a handker∣chief close over his eyes, and he groped for∣ward on his way. <HI>Tom,</HI> you must know, was remarkably fond of eating, and spent all his money in the purchase of tarts, fruit, and such kind of things; and at this time his cash was reduced to one poor two pence only; so that he could not have immediately discharged his wager had he lost it. As he was so fond of good things, he would make trial of whatever came in his way, and <HI>taste</HI> all that was offered him; by which means he was often disappoint∣ed, and sometimes made extremely sick. He
<PB N="32" REF="021188_0028_0FB29ECCCDBB5D98"/>
had pursued his course in various directions, to the great entertainment of his companions; sometimes on one side of the road and some∣times
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
on the other; one minute feeling for a post which he thought he had arrived at, against the rails of a house; at another groping for a tree in the middle of the highway; and in short, appeared entirely ignorant at which part of his journey he was arrived. When they had got near half way, mother <HI>Mixwell,</HI> the pye woman, met them, and <HI>Tom</HI> was very earnest to taste some of the contents of her basket.

<HI>Grinmore</HI> determined to purchase a laugh on the occasion, and offered to give him a custard if he could eat without his eyes. That <HI>Tom</HI> agreed to be no impediment, and <HI>Will,</HI> with the assistance of the rest, prepared his present, by mixing with it a good quantity of cow dung, which lay very opportunely in the road, some cattle having just passed in their way to a neigh∣bouring farm. <HI>Swallowell,</HI> whose greedy dis∣position always engaged him to take a large mouthful, very eagerly received the custard; had soon occasion to repent his haste, and with∣out thinking of his wager (one of the condi∣tions of which was, that he should on <HI>no</HI> oc∣casion remove the bandage) he hastily pulled off the handkerchief, and began spitting and sputtering in a manner truly diverting. <HI>Powel</HI> soon demanded his sixpence, as the for∣feit of unbinding his eyes; but <HI>Tom</HI> very an∣grily refused; declaring that he had been cheated, and that the filthy custard had been given him as a concerted measure to make him lose the wager. <HI>Powel</HI> denied the charge; but resented such an affront to his honour: and
<PB N="34" REF="021188_0030_0FB29ED499B7C550"/>
<HI>Grinmore</HI> having diverted himself some time with the anger of both parties, at length avowed that it was entirely his doing, and that <HI>Frank</HI> was wholly innocent of such an insiduous design.</P>
<P>This, however, did not satisfy the displeased <HI>Swallowell,</HI> who still retained the taste of the cow dung strongly in his mouth. He, therefore gave <HI>Powel</HI> a blow on his head as he was stoop∣ing to buckle his shoe. This dastardly trick was soon returned by <HI>Frank</HI> with some violence, who declared himself unwilling to fight; but that he would not tamely stand still to be thrashed in such a cowardly manner, by a boy to whom he was superiour. After drubbing him some time he walked on with his compan∣ions, and left battered <HI>Tom</HI> rolling in the mid∣dle of the road, to taste a second time, the cow dung which had occasioned the quarrel, and into the midst of which his antagonist had thrown him.</P>
<P>Just as he was rising, and trying to wipe off the dirt and dust which his clothes were cov∣ered with, he was overtaken by Mr. <HI>Verber;</HI> who was taking a walk with <HI>Powel's</HI> father,
<PB N="35" REF="021188_0031_0FB29ED6907FB970"/>
that gentleman having arrived a short time before on a visit to his son.</P>
<P>The master enquired of <HI>Swallowell</HI> the cause of his being in that dirty and wounded condi∣tion; of which being informed, he sent him home, and pursued his walk in quest of his ad∣versary. These particulars I learned from a friend of my master's to whom <HI>Tom</HI> commu∣nicated them on his return.</P>
<P><HI>Powel</HI> in the mean time arrived at the village, and having purchased the necessaries he set out to procure, sat down on a style
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="36" REF="021188_0032_0FB29ED80A96D4A8"/>
to eat some gingerbread; after which he took me out, and was just going to try my skill in pegging▪ halfpenny, when Mr. <HI>Verber</HI> and his father arrived. This unexpected sight af∣forded him great pleasure, and he accompanied the latter to an inn in the abovementioned vil∣lage where he had bespoke a dinner, promising to return with his son, and drink tea with Mr. <HI>Verber;</HI> that gentleman after mutual compli∣ments, leaving us to return home. I shall pass over the numberless enquiries which my master made after every individual of his fam∣ily, not forgetting <HI>Bull</HI> the black coach horse, and his companion <HI>Smiler;</HI> together with a great many questions after <HI>Rover</HI> the young pointer, and old <HI>Honesty</HI> the great yard dog, all which his father answered very kind∣ly, and much to his satisfaction. But as the reader is not acquainted with Miss <HI>Polly</HI> his sister, or Miss <HI>Patty</HI> his little cousin, and a thousand <HI>Jacks, Toms,</HI> and <HI>Harrys,</HI> about whose welfare he appeared to be extremely solicitous, I shall omit these particulars to give some ac∣count of the advice which his father after∣wards
<PB N="37" REF="021188_0033_0FB29ED988C577D8"/>
thought proper to give him, previous to their separation. He began by enquiring into the character of <HI>Swallowell;</HI> and <HI>Powel</HI> told him that he was a good natured boy e∣nough, but so greedy, that he was the jest of the whole school, every one taking pleasure to cheat him into a trial of some disagreeable taste. And I find <HI>you</HI> have this morning been of that number, replied his father, which I should not be much inclined to blame, as such a hog like disposition is a just subject of ridi∣cule. But I am very sorry <HI>Frank,</HI> the warmth of your temper has hurried you to add offence to raillery, and that you have concluded by fighting, what you began in play. You well know, my dear boy, the frequent caution I have given you upon this subject. I would by no means have you a <HI>coward,</HI> or afraid of be∣ing <HI>hurt;</HI> but to be ever ready to strike, or re∣turn a blow, is a proof of the violence of your passion, but no argument of the justice of your cause. If the boy you engage with is younger than yourself, it is the highest degree of mean∣ness to take such an unfair advantage of his in∣feriority;
<PB N="38" REF="021188_0034_0FB29EDB0FBE7CB0"/>
and if he is older, you stand but a bad chance. Nor do I think such contests ei∣ther prudent or honourable between <HI>equals</HI> in <HI>age</HI> and <HI>strength.</HI> To forgive an injury, and overlook an affront, is a much higher instance of <HI>true</HI> magnanimity, than to obtain the most complete conquest; and, in general, those are most ready to fight, who have been the aggres∣sors, and commenced the dispute: but an ill action is not rendered more excusable, or an unfair advantage reconciled to justice by the blows of passion, or the taunts of provocation. Let me persuade you, therefore, to forbear this
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="39" REF="021188_0035_0FB29EDCB41BD030"/>
ungenerous use of that strength, which was bestowed for nobler purposes; and endeavour to make yourself <HI>beloved</HI> for your <HI>kindness,</HI> ra∣ther than <HI>feared</HI> for your <HI>resentment.</HI> "But if it was known, replied my master, that a boy would not <HI>fight,</HI> he would be subject to the insults of every urchin in the school, and might stand still, like a cock on a <HI>Shrove Tuesday,</HI> to be thrown at by every coward who was not afraid to be thrashed in return; and I do maintain it to be <HI>impossible</HI> to keep up one's character with∣out it." You are much mistaken, young man, returned his father. I know what being at school is, and have been more years there than yourself, and if you will petulantly take offence at every little misunderstanding, and be soon subject to receive an affront, you may then find the cultivation of peace impossible. But if on the contrary, you determine never to strike the first blow, and never return it but in self defence, you will find, that those occasions will but sel∣dom happen; and there will other instances arise, to prove your contempt of pain, and for
<PB N="40" REF="021188_0036_0FB29EE0CC061830"/>
the exertion of your <HI>courage.</HI> In short, I think a boy who is afraid of being <HI>hurt,</HI> shews a very <HI>weak</HI> mind; but one that delights to hurt others, proves that he has a very <HI>wicked</HI> one.</P>
<P><HI>Powel</HI> coloured at the keenness of this re∣proof, and assured his father, that he would en∣deavour for the future to avoid quarrelling as much as he could. With this assurance the conversation was concluded, as they arrived at Mr. <HI>Verber's</HI> gate. What passed in their inter∣view with that gentleman, I cannot tell; as on entering the house, I was borrowed of my master by <HI>Ben Playful,</HI> and accompanied him into the yard. He was just going to engage with another, in what might be called a race: which was, to try which of the two could first chip a halfpenny from the middle, to the wall of the play ground. My antagonist, either from a defect in its form, or from a want of skill in its owner, in vain essayed to make the money advance; two or three times it just re∣moved it to a little distance, but more fre∣quently failed of touching it at all. While my new master (for such he afterwards became)
<PB N="41" REF="021188_0037_0FB29EE290A11098"/>
with the most expert dexterity, guided me for∣wards to the spot he wished; and, at four spins the halfpenny bounded forcibly against the wall. In a second and third game I met with equal success, and <HI>Ben</HI> exulted in having borrow∣ed the most excellent <HI>Top</HI> he had ever met with. I was next engaged with one of my associates, whom I remember to have seen in the very drawer which I mentioned in the beginning of these memoirs, as the first place I was introduced to. We had not much time for conversation, as we were each alternately pegged at an old brass button, with an inten∣tion to determine its progress different ways. I sought to impel it to the right, and my adversary with great assiduity, endeavoured to force it to the left hand; while the success∣ful labours of each, impressed the looks of our employers, with alternate joy or regret. At length, however, when the distance had nearly thrown me into despair, <HI>Playful,</HI> who was an adept in every game, with great judgment threw me upon the button, and struck it with
<PB N="42" REF="021188_0038_0FB29EE40821A270"/>
such force, that it flew so great a distance as to secure the expectation of victory, which the next attempt put beyond a doubt. This mat∣ter being thus decided, he was counting my <HI>acorns</HI> with great attention, when <HI>Powel</HI> joined him, and desired to have me restored; but <HI>Playful</HI> offered to give him a <HI>bat</HI> and <HI>ball</HI> in ex∣change, and begged he might keep me; to which <HI>Powel</HI> consenting, I became <HI>Ben Play∣ful's</HI> property. I was now eternally in use; for
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
my new master thought but little of his studies, though his neglect met with frequent disgrace.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="021188_0039_0FB29EE58A8BA178"/>
In the morning he was continually in such a hurry, that he scarce knew which of his lessons to attend; and it was no usual thing, to see him employ the little time he had in searching for his books, which were generally thrown by with careless indifference the moment school hours were over. It may be easily imagined, that in this situation he made greater proficien∣cy in his play than his learning; and indeed he was surpassed in the one by many boys of ten, though he was himself thirteen years old: While in every amusement he was considered as the first leader, and the most expert of the whole society. I had soon reason to repent the disposition of my new master, for although he commended me extremely, yet he complain∣ed that I was too heavy, and proposed a plan for my improvement, which I shudder to relate.</P>
<P>It was on a <HI>Saturday</HI> afternoon, that he be∣gan to put in execution his cruel project. And, ah! gentle reader! will you not sympathize with my sufferings, when I inform you, that this detestable scheme was no other than to extract my <HI>peg,</HI> and insert it in another top?
<PB N="44" REF="021188_0040_0FB29EE701F29C88"/>
My apprehensions on hearing such a dreadful intention were beyond description; and had I been capable of tears, to be sure I should have wept most plentifully. This relief was however denied, and all I could do, was pa∣tiently to expect my fate. Nor indeed would the prospect have been at all improved, by the indulgence of those lamentations which are peculiar to the human species. No one I suppose likes to be in pain; but it is surely a great degree of weakness, and extremely <HI>un∣manly,</HI> to cry and blubber upon every occasion, as I have seen some boys do, while they at the same time refuse the necessary means of relief, and endure that uneasiness of which they are so impatient, because they want resolution to take some nauseous medicine which is pre∣scribed as a cure for their disorder. I felt with the most dreadful apprehension, the string twisted tight round my peg, while several boys stood by as unfeeling spectators of my agony. They soon retired to the distance of a few paces to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> themselves from the danger of a blow, while they justly apprehended I might
<PB N="45" REF="021188_0041_0FB29EEB43B733D0"/>
be the occasion of; nor indeed had this pre∣caution been omitted could I possibly avoid such an accident. My master likewise took care to retreat behind a tree, while he swang me with all his force against its sides; until at
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
length overpowered by the blows, I felt my∣self divided, and my head flew off with impet∣uosity to a considerable distance, and lighting on a large bell glass (which the gardener had put down, while he opened a gate through which he wanted to pass) broke it into a thousand pieces. The consternation which this misfortune caused, for a time suspended the
<PB N="46" REF="021188_0042_0FB29EEE889E8330"/>
attention of my tormentors, and <HI>Playful</HI> ap∣peared to be extremely apprehensive of the consequence. The gardener immediately seiz∣ed on his shoulder, and declared he should appear before his master, and answer for the accident, which would otherwise be imputed to his negligence. To this <HI>Ben</HI> had great ob∣jections; first, because he expected Mr. <HI>Verber</HI> to be displeased with the fracture of the glass, and for a second reason, as he had omitted, for the sake of performing the above operation, to learn a task which he had been ordered to get perfectly before night. His resistance was however in vain; so putting my peg into his waistcoat pocket, and the gardener taking my head in his left hand, while with the right he dragged my master along, we proceeded to the great parlour, where we found Mr. <HI>Ver∣ber,</HI> two ladies and a gentleman. The com∣plaint was soon preferred against my larger part, which very narrowly escaped from cer∣tain destruction; Mr. <HI>Verber,</HI> at the conclu∣sion of the account, tossing me, without the least concern, into the fire; which, fortunate∣ly
<PB N="47" REF="021188_0043_0FB29EF004BD5D18"/>
for me, happened to have a large quantity of fresh coals just laid on; so that I did not immediately suffer from that conflagration, of which I was terribly afraid. My case how∣ever, seemed to be desperate; and although the reader may be anxious to hear the fate of my master, he must remember, that it is the memoirs of a <HI>Pegtop</HI> he is reading, and that therefore I consider myself as the principal ob∣ject of his attention. I shall consequently take the liberty of first informing him what were my own reflections in this dismal situa∣tion; before I concern myself to release <HI>Ben Playful,</HI> who is all this time standing in a state of frightful suspence before his master, and listening to the accusation of the gardener.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="021188_0044_0FB29EF1AF74F8B8"/>

<P>As a top when divided, as I then was, is just as capable of thought, as when in the most perfect condition, both parts having the power of imagination when separated, if such is the will of <HI>fancy</HI> to bestow; because as none but human beings can possess these pro∣perties which I now suppose, so it is equally easy to imagine, that the <HI>peg</HI> and the <HI>head</HI> can both understand a language, and reflect or fear, or rejoice and anticipate an event when apart, as if they were united. In other
<PB N="49" REF="021188_0045_0FB29EF8A7181A38"/>
words any thing which a man can possibly make must be incapable of understanding. And therefore, when a story is written or told where things inanimate are represented as talk∣ing or acting, it must be known to be only <HI>supposition;</HI> as in reality <HI>wood</HI> cannot <HI>feel,</HI> nor <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ron think.</HI> So if the Author of this volume chuses to make both parts of me comprehend at the same time, you can just as well imagine that, as any thing else which you are told of the like kind. To continue then the account of my adventures, I must inform you, that I lay on the summit of a hill of coals in dread∣ful apprehension that the blaze of two or three flames, which had made their way in different parts around, would some one of them reach and consume me. The force of my fall had sunk a kind of bed, as it were, in which I partly reposed; but every moment as it en∣creased my danger, added to the dread which I experienced; and I had certainly been destroyed in a few moments, as I felt the coals which supported me give way, the fire having burnt
<PB N="50" REF="021188_0046_0FB29EFA8D37BE48"/>
a hollow space underneath, and a large cake falling in, I had unavoidably perished, but for the kind assistance of the gentleman above∣mentioned; who going to stir the fire, took me out with the tongs, saying, that it was
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
a pity such a nice <HI>top</HI> should be lost, as there were so many children in the house who would be glad to possess it.</P>
<P>From this instance a moral reflection or two is so obvious, that I cannot persuade myself to omit them. As I was strongly impressed at
<PB N="51" REF="021188_0047_0FB29EFC04F23858"/>
the time with the consideration, that however innocence may be exposed through the folly of others to misfortune and danger, yet some method will be ever found for its rescue and protection. And this should incline those who are in an uneasy situation, to bear with pa∣tience the vexations which may occur; as they may be well assured, if they act with propriety themselves, they will in the end be enabled to surmount every difficulty, and re∣joice in the comforts of a more agreeable state. While those who neglect a proper attention to their necessary business, from an inclination to present pleasure, will frequently meet with some accident to obstruct their wishes, and punish them effectually for their disobedience.</P>
<P><HI>Ben Playful</HI> had at this time reason to be sensible of the truth of what is here advanced, as his master declared, that after paying for the glass, which he thought in <HI>justice</HI> he was o∣bliged to do, he should have been no ways displeased, had not his fondness for play con∣stantly been the occasion of neglecting his stud∣ies;
<PB N="52" REF="021188_0048_0FB29EFEF3726900"/>
he therefore kept him confined the rest of the evening, until he had, in some degree, made amends for his former omission. When it was bed time, and he had repeated the les∣son which he had since been very diligent to learn, he begged that I might be restored, promising to behave with more caution for the future. I am sorry, <HI>Playful,</HI> replied Mr. <HI>Verber,</HI> that your idleness does so frequently oblige me both to blame and to punish you. For my own credit I should certainly be desi∣rous to have you improve; but it is not of equal consequence to any person, as it will in future be to yourself. To acquire a com∣petent knowledge of different languages, but especially of your own and the latin tongue, is so essential to the character of a <HI>gentleman,</HI> that without it, you will certainly (be your fortune ever so large) meet with derision and contempt. A man who has the advantage of <HI>good sense,</HI> improved by a <HI>liberal education,</HI> may with assiduity and diligence, raise himself in the world, and be universally respected al∣though
<PB N="53" REF="021188_0049_0FB29F028B38D168"/>
destitute of <HI>riches;</HI> but the greatest <HI>affluence</HI> cannot purchase esteem, when the possessor is <HI>illiterate</HI> or <HI>ill bred.</HI> Bad spelling, or bad English are certain indications of meanness, and will be always considered as such; and if you are not attentive to acquire a thorough knowledge of your grammar, you will never at any age be able to speak with propriety, or write with elegance. The far∣ther you advance in learning, the more agree∣able you will find it; but by deferring your business for the sake of playing a little longer, you multiply your troubles, and introduce such confusion into the disposition of your time, as involves you in perpetual difficulty. Young people are seldom to be persuaded, that the first part of their days is the only sea∣son for the attainment of knowledge; but believe me, <HI>Playful,</HI> if you neglect the present opportunity of improvement, you will have reason to repent your folly to the latest hour of your life.</P>
<P>My master very seriously attended to the
<PB N="54" REF="021188_0050_0FB29F0449472EE0"/>
conclusion of this good advice; but before he retired, again entreated to have me re∣stored. I was accordingly delivered to him with repeated charges to behave better, which be promised faithfully to comply with.</P>
<P>The next morning he rose very early with an intention of keeping his word. But un∣luckily in feeling for a handkerchief, my head rolled out at the same time from his pocket. The temptation of completing his top be∣fore school time became too great to be re∣sisted, and going to some of his companions who had been of his party the preceding day, a consultation was held to determine to what top my peg should be joined; when after va∣rious experiments with several others, it was decreed, that my divided parts should be a∣gain reunited; and <HI>Playful</HI> hastily taking his hat, scraped off a little as it lay on his knee, and applying it to the end of my peg, in hopes of making it spin lighter, thrust it once more into its former position. As he had laid aside his books for the sake of fin∣nishing
<PB N="55" REF="021188_0051_0FB29F05C5AD75F0"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
the improvement in his top, which the day before he had begun, he found it im∣possible to withstand the inclination of at least <HI>trying</HI> how I should spin; and finding me much lighter than before, he went on with another, and another trial, intending each one should be the last, his conscience suggested all the time, the danger to which he exposed him∣self, of offending his master by the violation of his promise. He was twisting the string round as quick as he could move his fingers,
<PB N="56" REF="021188_0052_0FB29F0A49532D30"/>
telling one of his school fellows, that he ac∣tually would play no longer than I kept up, before he went in to his studies, when the school bell rang, and obliged him to attend its dreaded but unavoidable summons.</P>
<P>With a heavy heart he put me into his pock∣et, and going to a bench in the yard where he had left it, took up his book, reading his lesson over as he slowly crept along, until stop∣ping a considerable time at a window in a pas∣sage which led to the school, one of the ushers came softly behind, and giving him a hearty stroke with a cane upon his shoulders, told him to quicken his pace, for he was always <HI>lag last.</HI> The distress which he afterwards experienc∣ed on account of his neglect, was a deserved punishment, for his disobedience to his father's advice, after a given promise to the contrary. But so it will ever happen, where a fondness for amusement is suffered to prevail to such excess, as to engross that portion of time, which ought to be more usefully employed.</P>
<P>Children are apt to think, that a few <HI>min∣utes</HI> added to their diversions can make no
<PB N="57" REF="021188_0053_0FB29F0BC684BF38"/>
difference; and <HI>minutes</HI> slip away insensibly into a quater of an hour; their play becomes more interesting, the game is nearly conclud∣ed, or the kite will soon be down, it is a pity to stop its flight! a race will shortly be deter∣mined, or some such reason prevails, until the time is elapsed in which their business should have been attended; and they are left to be∣wail in sorrow, and regret the folly of their negligence. It would be more prudent, therefore, at first to secure the essentials, and do what is necessary before they begin to en∣gage in those diversions, which, however lau∣dable in their proper season, may frequently ensnare them into errour, and subject them to future punishment.</P>
<P>Poor <HI>Playful!</HI> who would have had time sufficient to have finished his job, and might have quietly enjoyed me when school time was over, by an indiscreet use of his morn∣ing hours, was confined all the rest of the day, and had an additional task given him to learn, upon pain of a severe flogging if it was
<PB N="58" REF="021188_0054_0FB29F0D75E6A520"/>
neglected. Whether he underwent any pun∣ishment, or what afterwards became of him, I cannot tell, as I slipped through a hole in his pocket as he was standing at the yard gate after breakfast, whither he had been sent by the latin usher to fetch one of his companions who was at play in the road. I did not however remain long in a state of freedom, but was picked up by a baker's boy, who brought bread to Mr. <HI>Verber's.</HI> He surveyed me with great joy, and we soon mounted together into his cart, and jolted on to several other houses in the neighbourhood; at one of which my new master met with a companion, who beg∣ged to ride to the next village, which was a∣bout half a mile distance. This boy, who was near twelve years old, had been to carry a letter from a charity school, to which he belonged, to one of the gentleman who was a benefactor to it.</P>
<P><HI>Charles Heedmore</HI> (which was the name my master called him by) was soon made acquaint∣ed with the treasure which <HI>George Mealwell</HI> had
<PB N="59" REF="021188_0055_0FB29F13C5A2FE40"/>
found, and I was produced in consequence; and both parties agreed to make trial of my
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
merit on the spot. Old <HI>Trot</HI> was accordingly stopped, and they adjourned to a piece of ground which suited with their intention; from whence they could watch the cart, and where they quietly played for some time. At length a drove of geese, which were on their journey to <HI>Boston,</HI> in passing by alarmed honest <HI>Trot</HI> so much, that he set off with uncommon agility, and galloped
<PB N="60" REF="021188_0056_0FB29F15983A8F78"/>
away with the cart and its contents; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>thing which was very unusual, as he seldom, with∣out a great deal of whipping, would move faster than at the rate of three miles an hour. As it happened, however, the humour seized him, to make a hasty conclusion to his jour∣ney; which he soon did, by oversetting the cart upon a hillock of dirt, that had been raised on one side of the road. My master and his companion, who perceived their horse set off with such uncommon speed, immedi∣ately followed him with all the haste they could make, and were just time enough to be witnesses <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> (though not to prevent) the overthrow, which they most sadly deplored. To their great sorrow, they soon found that one of the shafts was broken in two, and the top of the cart had received considerable dam∣age; while poor <HI>Trot</HI> lay floundering and kicking, having entangled himself in the harness. They in vain endeavoured to set him free, and were so terrified, especially <HI>George Mealwell,</HI> with the apprehension of re∣turning
<PB N="61" REF="021188_0057_0FB29F1710434CB0"/>
to his master, that he was incapable of using the proper methods of procuring him liberty; at length however, with the assist∣ance of a countryman who was coming from a potatoe field, the horse was extricated, and the cart pronounced incapable of proceeding. The point was now to be determined, whether they should go home with the horse, and in∣form his master of the accident, or first endea∣vour to get a cartwright who lived in the vil∣lage, to come and inspect the damage, and try to repair it. But to this last proposal, <HI>George</HI> very justly objected, that if the man would consent to come, and even if he should be so fortunate as to accomplish their wishes, the time of their stay would certainly betray them; and if <HI>that</HI> could be managed, he had not money to sat∣isfy the charge which it would necessarily oc∣casion. The only alternative then was, to take home honest <HI>Trot,</HI> on whom they both bestowed many angry invectives, and to tell the best account they could of the accident to
<PB N="62" REF="021188_0058_0FB29F1890613CC0"/>
Mr. <HI>Bakeall,</HI> his owner. <HI>George,</HI> who was in general a tolerable good boy, felt on this oc∣casion his fears prove too great for his honour; and proposed to his companion, to inform his master, that he had never left the cart but upon account of his business, and that the appearance of a man suddenly starting out of a hedge, had frightened the horse, who had ran away with him, and nearly killed him by the overset of the cart, which all his endeavours could not prevent; adding, that he would contrive to get a bruise on his shoulder, and a scratch on the face, to prove the truth of his assertion, and which would incline his master to pity his sufferings and mitigate his anger. For to say that <HI>Trot</HI> had been frighten∣ed at a drove of geese, would appear highly improbable, and subject the reality of his tale to be doubted.</P>
<P><HI>Heedmore</HI> represented to his friend, that to speak the <HI>truth</HI> on <HI>all</HI> occasions, was, in his opinion, the safest way; as he would certainly live in continual dread of detection, and if
<PB N="63" REF="021188_0059_0FB29F1A03AC1BF8"/>
that happened, incur a greater degree of pun∣ishment, and expose himself to unavoidable contempt; that the word of a <HI>liar</HI> is at all
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
times liable to suspicion, and that it was to add <HI>wickedness</HI> to <HI>folly,</HI> to pursue the scheme he had mentioned. He therefore concluded with a concurrence with the old maxim, that come what might, in his mind, "<HI>honesty</HI> would be the best policy." <HI>George</HI> agreed to the force of his arguments in <HI>general,</HI> but op∣posed
<PB N="64" REF="021188_0060_0FB29F1ECF747778"/>
in this <HI>particular</HI> instance, the dread he was in of his master's displeasure. That as to any <HI>discovery,</HI> he thought it utterly impos∣sible, as no one was witness to the accident, or could confront him with a falsehood. That he had as great a dislike to <HI>lying,</HI> as <HI>Heedmore,</HI> but really he did not relish the thoughts of thrashing, which a confession of the <HI>truth</HI> would certainly bring him, and in short, he was resolved to tell the story according to the above plan.</P>
<P><HI>Charles</HI> repeated his reasons to dissuade him from so wrong a determination, and enforced them by saying, if he was asked any questions about the affair, he would certainly declare the <HI>truth;</HI> which must involve <HI>Mealwell</HI> in dis∣grace, and reveal the deceit. <HI>George,</HI> in con∣sequence of this speech, grew extremely angry, and called his opponent a <HI>mean spirited, ill na∣tured, treacherous</HI> fellow; declared he should scorn to betray a friend, and incur the odious character of a <HI>mischief making tell tale.</HI> That if he <HI>did</HI> use him so basely, he would fight with him wherever he met him, and never speak
<PB N="65" REF="021188_0061_0FB29F2184456A10"/>
or play with him again. To these threats <HI>Charles</HI> replied, that he was extreme sorry to perceive he was so much displeased, but he did not think he had behaved amiss, or given any just cause of offence; and, continued he, I cannot agree to <HI>lye</HI> for you, though I would do every thing to serve you. My father, <HI>George,</HI> said he, though he is but a poor shoemaker, and has, as you know, a large fam∣ily, yet has been very kind to us, and taken great pains to teach us as much as he can; and has got me into the charity school, be∣cause he says it is a fine thing to be able to read and write: And my eldest brother, who is two years older than I am, was taken a great while ago, into farmer <HI>Wood's</HI> family, who would have provided for him, and did find him in clothes; and gave him several presents. But <HI>Jack,</HI> like a simpleton, one day when he was sent with a letter to the post office, for∣got to carry it, and afterwards being afraid his master would be angry, said he had deliv∣ered it, and threw it into the fire, to prevent
<PB N="66" REF="021188_0062_0FB29F2351CB8EA8"/>
being discovered. While it was burning, he was called away, and Mr. <HI>Wood</HI> found a piece which had dropped on the hearth, and which he produced to <HI>Jack,</HI> and scolded him hear∣tily for telling such a falsity. Some time af∣ter that, he was sent to the next market town, to fetch a parcel which was to be left there from <HI>London;</HI> He staid very late to see a puppet show, and when he came home, said, he had lost his way (the night being very soggy) and that had detained him so long; adding a story of his own invention of the places he had wandered to. In short, his lies were discovered, and Mr. <HI>Wood</HI> sent him home, de∣claring he would have nothing further to do with so naughty a boy: And he has never since got into place, no one being willing to take him with such a character. This example, which I would not have mentioned, but to persuade you how wicked and foolish it is to be guilty of such a crime, may be a warning to you, to avoid falling into such a state as poor <HI>Jack</HI> has done; who has in vain tried to regain his lost name. But do as you will, I
<PB N="67" REF="021188_0063_0FB29F28754B3040"/>
am determined to speak the <HI>truth,</HI> if I suffer for it at present; since I never did otherwise but once, and then I was so unhappy, that I resolved never to do the like again. For af∣ter all, <HI>George,</HI> if we are <HI>not</HI> found out, yet God sees and knows whether we speak truth or not; and I do always think of a chapter of the <HI>Acts,</HI> which I had a good while ago for my lesson at school, where a man and his wife dropped down dead for telling a <HI>lye:</HI> And I remember my master told <HI>Tom Hide,</HI> that though he might not die about it, he would certainly be punished, both in this world and the next. I am sure, said <HI>George,</HI> I shall be punished <HI>now</HI> with a <HI>vengeance,</HI> if I speak the <HI>truth:</HI> But I am not such a <HI>liar</HI> as <HI>Hide</HI> neither, so if you will promise not to betray me un∣less you are <HI>asked,</HI> and not to tell any body you was with me, why I will do as I told you, and go you home now, and leave me to come presently, if your conscience is not too squeamish for that. <HI>Heedmore</HI> endeavoured to dissuade his friend once more, from his pur∣pose;
<PB N="68" REF="021188_0064_0FB29F29C5B8D418"/>
but finding his arguments were inef∣fectual, left him with regret. My new mas∣ter for some time employed himself in thump∣ing his shoulder against a mile stone, with an intent to bruise it as he had projected, but
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
having a great objection to every kind of pain, his knocks were so gentle, as to make but lit∣tle impression. He afterwards attempted to scratch his face, first with his nails, which he wanted resolution to use effectually, and af∣terwards with a piece of bramble which he
<PB N="69" REF="021188_0065_0FB29F2B47605228"/>
tore out of a hedge, and which succeeded bet∣ter than he wished, as a thorn got into his eye, and occasioned the most violent agony: A just reward for the wickedness of his inten∣tion, in so wilfully resolving to deceive his master. His endeavours to extract it, proving quite ineffectual, he stood screaming with the pain for some time, and at last hurried home, leaving <HI>Trot</HI> to graze along the side of the road, which he did very quietly.</P>
<P>As soon as he reached Mr. <HI>Bakeall's,</HI> he went into the kitchen, where the whole fami∣ly were sitting down to dinner on a shoulder of mutton and potatoes, which came smoak∣ing from the oven as he entered. <HI>George</HI> told a pitiful, but false tale of the accident which had hurt his eye, and the situation in which he had left the cart, declaring he could not see to find old <HI>Trot;</HI> but imagined he was at no great distance from the cart. His master, mis∣tress, their daughter, and the man who assisted in the baking, all by turns endeavoured to extract the thorn: But he kept his eye close
<PB N="70" REF="021188_0066_0FB29F32F82BAB50"/>
shut, by which mean it worked its way still farther, and made the misfortune more danger∣ous. The anguish growing almost insupporta∣ble, his master took him to a Mr. <HI>Keen,</HI> a surgeon in the village, who declared the case to be a very bad one, and though he got it out at last, it was with the greatest degree of dif∣ficulty.</P>
<P>He then enquired by what means it had happened, and Mr. <HI>Bakeall</HI> gave the account which he had received from <HI>George,</HI> adding, that his man was gone to see what was become of the horse and cart. At the conclusion of the history, Mr. <HI>Keen</HI> hoped there was no <HI>lye</HI> in the case, as he saw <HI>Mealwell</HI> at play with another boy at pegtop; and the horse and cart stand∣ing without a driver in the road, as he came from visiting a patient. He said likewise, that he knew the other boy by sight, and believed it to be <HI>Charles Heedmore,</HI> the shoemaker's son.</P>
<P><HI>George,</HI> who was now in a terrible fright, yet was unwilling to confess that he had told an untruth; so to prove the veracity of his former
<PB N="71" REF="021188_0067_0FB29F370E4D7BD8"/>
assertion, was obliged to support it by repeated lies. Thus does the commission of one errour lead to numberless crimes; and his first fault in leaving his business to attend unseasonably to his play, was the occasion of such a train of wickedness and guilt.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Bakeall,</HI> who before the present event, had never any reason to suspect the veracity of his apprentice, was strongly inclined to give credit to the history he had related; yet, at the same time, thought it necessary to discover the <HI>truth,</HI> that the success of a <HI>lye,</HI> if it proved to be one, might not encourage him to any future deceit. He accordingly first searched his pocket, and finding me there, was rather staggered in his good opinion of <HI>Mealwell,</HI> as he knew he had not a top in his possession in the morning, having heard him at break∣fast wish he could afford to purchase one. Tak∣ing me, therefore, in his hand, he left <HI>George</HI> in charge of Mr. <HI>Keen,</HI> and proceded to <HI>Heed∣more's</HI> father, in hopes of learning further about the affair. Having told his business, the
<PB N="72" REF="021188_0068_0FB29F3A53657058"/>
old man desired him to walk into a little room behind his shop, and he would as soon as his
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
son came home, whom he every moment ex∣pected, make the enquiries he wished, and that the door being left open between, he might be ear witness to his replies. This pro∣posal being assented to, Mr. <HI>Bakeall</HI> seated himself in readiness, and <HI>Charles</HI> very soon entered the shop. His father immediately enquired what had occasioned his not being at home at dinner? To which question he at first
<PB N="73" REF="021188_0069_0FB29F3CE4542BC0"/>
return no answer; but upon its being repeat∣ed, he honestly said, he did not like to tell, be∣cause another person was concerned with him on the occasion of his stay; however, said he, I will acknowledge thus far, that I foolishly loitered away my time, for the sake of a game with the best <HI>Pegtop</HI> I ever saw. And was you at school as soon as you ought to have been? said his father. Why I cannot say that I was, replied he: and my master was extremely an∣gry, and would know the cause; and he blamed me very much for my idleness; but in consider∣ation of having told the truth, he did not punish me; which, he said, he should other∣wise have done. But I am afraid, father, when you know what has been the consequence of my folly, <HI>you</HI> will be less merciful. Why pray what has? said Mr. <HI>Heedmore,</HI> in a voice sufficiently stern to have intimidated a boy of less honour than honest <HI>Charles.</HI> Do not be an∣gry, replied the poor fellow in a tremulous accent! Do not be angry, and you shall know all! The pair of shoes which I was to have de∣livered
<PB N="74" REF="021188_0070_0FB29F3ECFEBB6D0"/>
to farmer <HI>Trudgman,</HI> I lost while I was at play. I laid them down on the mile stone, and until I came home, never once thought of them again; and though I then ran back to them place as fast as I could, they were gone. <HI>You</HI> lost the shoes? returned his father. Why child, you never had them! I gave them to <HI>Jack</HI> to carry home; and you cannot have had them, for you have never been in the house since. Here was a subterfuge, by which <HI>Charles,</HI> had he been so inclined, might for the present have saved himself, and laid the blame on his brother. But disdaining such an ungenerous and base artifice, he added, that he was very sorry for his fault, but <HI>he</HI> had lost the shoes; for <HI>Jack</HI> had met him when he first came from school, and desired him as he was going with the circular letters, to carry them with him. His father then insisted upon knowing with whom he had been at play, as probably they had been stolen by his companion. <HI>Charles</HI> assured him that could not be the case; and afterwa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in vindication of his friend's cha∣racter,
<PB N="75" REF="021188_0071_0FB29F40488E0488"/>
declared it was <HI>George Mealwell;</HI> but entreated his father on no account to reveal what he had told him to any one. What is your reason, <HI>Charles,</HI> rejoined Mr. <HI>Heedmore,</HI> for requiring silence? was there any great crime in playing with you at pegtop? To be sure you was wasting the time you should have been getting ready for school; but why is <HI>Mealwell</HI> so much afraid of its being known? Ah! Father, replied <HI>Charles,</HI> shaking his head, I wish he may have no more to an∣swer for than I have; but in confidence
<FIGURE>

<PB N="76" REF="021188_0072_0FB29F42DC7E0588"/>
I will tell you, that when we parted, he was determined to tell his master such a shocking <HI>lie</HI> about the cart, which the one eyed horse ran away with and broke, and to hurt his own eyes, and bruise his shoulder, to prove the truth of his story, that it has quite altered my opinion of him; though I believe him to be strictly honest, and that he would not cheat any body for the world. Those who are so wicked as to <HI>lie,</HI> returned Mr. <HI>Heedmore,</HI> will be guilty (at least are to be suspected) of any crime, since to forfeit your word, is to break every tie of honour; it is like the hemp with which we sew shoes, <HI>Charles;</HI> if that fails, they will come in pieces, you know, and be rotten, and good for nothing. So if people say one thing, and mean another, there is no knowing when you may trust their tale. But pray, how came the beast to set off? he looks staid and steady enough! I should never suspect him of a prancing freak! Why, father, replied <HI>Charles,</HI> we were busy on the ground upon the left hand side of the road, and <HI>George</HI> had just taken up
<PB N="77" REF="021188_0073_0FB29F444EFEAF20"/>
the <HI>Top</HI> in a wooden spoon, which he had in his pocket, and as ill luck would have it, a noisy drove of cackling geese came waddling along, with two men with those abominable long sticks and a rag at the end; so that al∣together frightened <HI>Trot,</HI> and he took to his heels before we were aware, and though we directly made after him, yet away he galloped with the cart, until he came close to farmer <HI>Ploughwell's</HI> great dunghill and on a hillock of dirt, tumbled himself down, and overset bread and every thing else. The quartern loaves, and threepenny, and pecks, and two bags of flour, all rolled into the middle of the road; but as it is a dry day, that was no great harm; the worst matter of all was, the cart was broken, and the harness much dam∣aged, and so for fear his master should be angry, as he certainly would be, <HI>Mealwell</HI> was resolved to <HI>lie,</HI> and get off if he can that way. And did you endeavour (enquired his father) to persuade him not to do so? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> know that was his mind, and leave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="78" REF="021188_0074_0FB29F45976234C0"/>
follow it, was not much like an honest fellow. Yes, that I did, answered <HI>Charles!</HI> but he would have his own way, and desired me to march home, and so I did at last when I found all I could say was to no purpose. Well, you are a good boy, said Mr. <HI>Heedmore,</HI> but I hardly think it right to know he is telling such a falshood, without letting it be known; and I think his master ought to be acquainted with his tricks. He then concluded with lament∣ing the loss his son's carelessness had occasion∣ed; but said, he would convince him that he was not less merciful than his school master, by pardoning his fault for the sake of encou∣ragement to his veracity; assuring him, that <HI>truth</HI> would be at all times its own reward. After receiving his father's acquital, <HI>Charles</HI> walked away with the cheerful appearance of conscious innocence, and Mr. <HI>Bakeall</HI> came forward to take his leave. He soon returned to the terrified <HI>Mealwell,</HI> who in the mean time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ffered all the uneasiness of a guilty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> being afraid of detection, punishment
<PB N="79" REF="021188_0075_0FB29F4827B96730"/>
and contempt. His master informed Mr. <HI>Keen</HI> of the success of his visit, and concluded with high commendations of <HI>Charles Heedmore;</HI> and after which, turning to <HI>George,</HI> he said very calmly, you had good reason to think I should have been angry at an accident which has hap∣pened entirely from your idleness and folly. But you shall find, my lad, that your trimming shall be pretty handsomely increased, for the lies you have told about it! So saying, he took him by the shoulder, and turned him tow∣ards the door.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Keen</HI> hoped his eye would soon be well, and said, he was sorry he had behaved in so wicked a manner as to deserve chastisement; but hoped, it would be a warning to him in future, that in doing a wrong action no one can be sure of secrecy; and that to be faith∣ful to <HI>truth</HI> upon all occasions, is the only way to be secure from evil. He then took his leave, and his visitors <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>parted. <HI>George</HI> trudged si∣lently on with a heavy heart behind his mas∣ter, who had misunderstood Mr. <HI>Keen's</HI> ex∣pression
<PB N="80" REF="021188_0076_0FB29F49AAB07780"/>

abovementioned, of a <HI>warning,</HI> and called out to him to quicken his pace, adding, yes, yes, as the surgeon says, I will give you a <HI>warming</HI> with a vengeance! you shall not be cold again in a hurry, I will war∣rant you! Come along you lying dog! I will try whether you can feel my horse whip as soon as you get home; and as for your eye, if you had quite lost it, it would have been but what you deserved. This threat it may be well imagined did not make <HI>George</HI> more
<PB N="81" REF="021188_0077_0FB29F4B1EDF2708"/>
willing to proceed. So taking hold of his arm, Mr. <HI>Bakeall,</HI> who was near the house, dragged him on, and first examined the bruise on his shoulder, which was scarcely visible, but which he promised his strokes should much increase; and then leading him to a tree in a little yard, where the man was enter∣ing with old <HI>Trot</HI> and the shattered cart, he snatched his whip in a hurry, and tying him up with some rope, which had fastened the broken harness, thrashed him so violently, that the blood followed his strokes before he con∣cluded; which was sufficiently visible, as he had taken off his clothes before he began. Thus ended an affair of which I had been the in∣nocent occasion, and which <HI>George</HI> imagined he in some measure revenged a short time af∣ter, when finding me on the feat of an old easy chair, where Mr. <HI>Bakeall</HI> had thrown me, he took me up, and abused me with as much warmth as if I had been able to defend my∣self; concluding with a declaration, that I should never again get him a thrashing; and
<PB N="82" REF="021188_0078_0FB29F4C58E30478"/>
that but for me, he had been in a whole skin. So saying, he whirled me with great violence into the high road, where I narrowly escaped falling on a sharp stone, which must inevita∣bly have split and rendered me useless; but fortunately I rolled on the edge of an oppo∣site path way where I was soon after picked up, for the first time in my life, by a young lady, who was walking home with her maid from a boarding school, at some little distance. While I lay in this situation a reflection natu∣rally
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="83" REF="021188_0079_0FB29F4E96BC28F0"/>
arose, on the anger which children often express against inanimate things; which by making a wrong use of, have proved, as in the present case, the mean of subjecting them to disgrace. Had <HI>George</HI> when he found me at Mr. <HI>Verber's,</HI> been content to put me in his pocket until his business was finished, he might have played without fear or blame. But by doing what his conscience told him was im∣proper, he carlessly left the cart to the care of old <HI>Trot,</HI> who finding himself free from the restraint of a driver, occasioned the mischief, which <HI>Mealwell's</HI> care ought to have prevented. But was the poor <HI>Pegtop</HI> to blame in all this? Did the <HI>Pegtop</HI> make him tell a lie, and for∣feit his honour and reputation? Was that all accountable for his perseverence in an untruth? or, for the thorn which he put into his eye? In short, I think it will be evident to every reader, that the fault was all his own; and that the poor <HI>Pegtop</HI> could not justly be charged with any share of his guilt. But to return to my new mistress, who was a girl
<PB N="84" REF="021188_0080_0FB29F507B36B100"/>
about ten years old, and who appeared greatly pleased with what she had found. Taking me up, and shewing me to the servant who attended her, said with much glee, "See, <HI>Betty,</HI> what I have got! I shall now have a <HI>Top</HI> as well as my brothers, who will not lend me theirs, because they say it is not a <HI>girl's</HI> play thing." She then hopped along, first on one leg, and then on the other, until we came to a handsome house, where two genteel look∣ing boys were sitting on a chain, which en∣closed a round plot of glass before it. Your servant, Miss! said the eldest; what, are you just returned from school? and how do all the young ladies do? And what, interrupted the other, have you got in your hand, <HI>Sophy?</HI> Whose <HI>Top</HI> is that? I dare say it is the one I bought last <HI>Tuesday</HI> at the fair, and you must not have it, I assure you. It is my own, Sir? replied my mistress with an air of triumph, and I do not want yours again, I promise you! So saying, she was walking in doors; but they both in an instant pursued her, and
<PB N="85" REF="021188_0081_0FB29F5189A17FF8"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
forced away the top, to examine whether it was the one they suspected. Just at this in∣stant a gentleman, whom I afterwards found was their father, came up, and taking hold of the youngest, "Pray, young man," said he, "what are you about? Is this behaving properly to your sister? I am quite ashamed of you! what is the matter, <HI>Sophy?"</HI> The young lady was going to speak, but <HI>Frederick,</HI> the youngest, without waiting for her answer, called out to Mr. <HI>Jackson,</HI> She has got one of
<PB N="86" REF="021188_0082_0FB29F5307C6C0D0"/>
our tops, Sir, and we are going to take it from her, that is all. It is not theirs, I assure you, Sir, replied my mistress: I found it just now in my way from school, and indeed it does not belong to them. The gentleman ac∣cordingly took me from his son, and present∣ing me again to Miss <HI>Jackson,</HI> she ran into the house, and asked a servant whom she met in the hall, for a piece of cord; which she soon twisted round me, and began to make trial of my abili∣ties. I soon found she was ignorant of the art, as she slung me down so awkwardly, that I only rolled about, without being at all able to spin.</P>
<P>Her brothers, who were not long before they paid her a visit were much diverted at her un∣successful attempt, and begged they might be permitted to try whether the fault was in me or their sister; to which she consented, upon their promise of returning me immediately. <HI>Edward,</HI> who was the eldest, kept me up for near a min∣ute; and I spun so well, as to sleep more soundly than I had ever done before. In short, he declared he would give her any thing to
<PB N="87" REF="021188_0083_0FB29F5489055B50"/>
possess me, and delivered me to <HI>Frederick</HI> with the highest commendations; adding, it was a shame that any <HI>girl</HI> in the world should be suf∣fered to keep such a top. His brother afford∣ed me as much satisfaction; for a <HI>Pegtop</HI> of any emulation is as happy as its owner, when it is spun by a skilful hand, and when it is so fortunate as to excel, <HI>"will share with its Lord the pleasure and the pride"</HI> of those praises which are bestowed on its merit. I was soon returned to <HI>Sophia,</HI> who seemed to be much mortified that she could not make me spin; and rejoiced exceedingly, when I once staggered round for two or three times, though I immediately after fell down, to the enter∣tainment of her brothers, who offered her any thing in their possession in exchange for me. The following verses however, at last effected, what no other arguments had the power to accomplish, and she gave me to mas∣ter <HI>Edward</HI> for a landscape, which his father had the sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e morning presented him with.</P>

<P>Just as the exchange was agreed upon, Mr. <HI>Jackson</HI> entered; the above verses laying upon the table, he took them up and read them; after which, addressing himself to his eldest son, I see, <HI>Edward,</HI> said he, by the hand writ∣ing, that this is your composition, and perhaps the <HI>poetry,</HI> when your age is considered, may not be thought much amiss. But I am very
<PB N="90" REF="021188_0086_0FB29F5921090800"/>
sorry to say, the sentiments which they con∣tain are deficient in a very essential point, and are so much wanting in good nature, that whatever credit may be derided to your <HI>head,</HI> they will certainly do no honour to your <HI>heart.</HI></P>
<P>A talent for ridicule is a very dangerous ac∣complishment, as it is seldom exerted under the influence of good humour; at least the feel∣ings of those against whom it is levelled are seldom considered; and he deserves but little of our esteem, who, to prove his wit, would say, or write any thing, which might give un∣easiness to a friend. In the present instance, though your satire may be justly pointed against such girls as forget the delicacy of their sex, and behave improperly; yet, to address them to a sister, who is not guilty of this fault, and who was by no means to blame in keeping what was her own property, is, as I before said, no proof of your affection or kindness. To exult with a pretended superiority over <HI>the girls,</HI> as you are apt with an air of insult to express yourself, and to sneer at their amuse∣ments,
<PB N="91" REF="021188_0087_0FB29F5B3AFB0790"/>
while you deny them to share in your's is a proof of the weakness of your understand∣ing; but will never exalt you in the opinion of men of sense.</P>
<P>A coxcomb, <HI>Edward,</HI> is a despicable char∣acter; and those who are most proud of their fancied advantages, will be commonly found to have the least real merit. Never, therefore, pretend to boast of your learning, or despise <HI>women</HI> in <HI>general,</HI> or your <HI>sister</HI> in <HI>partic∣ular,</HI> under the idea that you are so much
<FIGURE>

<PB N="92" REF="021188_0088_0FB29F5C07C3F210"/>
wiser, because you understand a little <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek,</HI> since such an affectation of superiority is equally despicable in men or boys.</P>
<P>To disregard the learned languages is a proof of an illiterate and uninformed mind, which from not knowing, is unacquainted with their necessity and use; but to imagine, that wis∣dom is centered in the ancients, and that a knowledge of <HI>Homer, Virgil, Terence,</HI> or any other author you may read, will constitute you a respectable character, is a mistake which can only arise from ignorance.</P>
<P>The true use of learning is to improve the understanding, and enlarge our ideas; that is, to shew the reader in the example of former times, what virtues made a man useful to so∣ciety, and acquired him reputation; and what vices rendered him hateful to others, and un∣happy in himself. If therefore you neglect to make this use of your studies, you have but little reason to be proud of the advantage of a good education, since learning is to little purpose, if it will not teach you to govern
<PB N="93" REF="021188_0089_0FB29F5DAECB1870"/>
your temper, and to behave with honour and justice upon all occasions. As to the verses which have occasioned me to speak to you up∣on this subject, they would have been more justifiable, had the <HI>top</HI> been taken from you by <HI>Sophia.</HI> In which case the allusion to the dog in the fable would have been more perfect and your threat of throwing away her <HI>gewgaws,</HI> as you call them, have been made with greater justice. But as the toy, be it ever so improper for a girl, was yet her own property, and she did not re∣fuse to lend, though she wished not to part with it entirely, she certainly was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from your accusation of being <HI>cross,</HI> and deserved not to meet with that disdain with which she is treated in the conclusion. I do not wish to discourage any attempt which your genius may incline you to make of writing either in verse or prose, but I would advise you to let your subject be better chosen, and never to support your cause by ridicule, when you cannot main∣tain it with reason and truth. I believe, con∣tinued he, I have got a copy of verses that
<PB N="94" REF="021188_0090_0FB29F5F11820288"/>
your friend <HI>Charles Goodwin</HI> sent to his sister, in answer to a letter, in which she expressed herself afraid that her correspondence might be troublesome, and that he would disdain to take
<FIGURE>

notice of a sister, who could not boast of equal knowledge with himself. The poetical merit of the lines is small, but the tenderness they manifest, and the grateful remembrance of her past attention which they imply, make them worthy of your imitation.</P>

<P>This performance, continued Mr. <HI>Jackson,</HI> when he had read to them the abovementioned verses, I do not recommend as a model in any respect, except in the good natured intention with which it is manifestly written; but come, added he, I see the coach is ready, and your mother is waiting to accompany us to <HI>Boston.</HI> So saying, he went out of the room, and <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> took me up, and putting me into his pocket, accompanied his father and brother to the carriage.</P>
<P>Nothing worth recording occured until we reached the metropolis, when a cart laden with wine stood opposite to a tavern, and hin∣dered

our progress for some time; as on ac∣count of a fire which had lately happened, the ruins were inclosed, and the street was too nar∣row to make room for two carriages abreast. The young gentlemen shewed their impatience at this delay, by kneeling upon the seat to look through the front glass; then putting their heads out of the side window; and <HI>Edward</HI> taking me out to beguile the time, expressed his uneasiness that the coachman would not proceed. At length an affair, which happened
<PB N="99" REF="021188_0095_0FB29F668FB13E10"/>
on the path way close to the place where they were detained, engrossed their attention, and furnished them with a subject of conversation for the remainder of the day. An old woman in a red cloak and tattered gown, was selling oranges, apples, and chesnuts on a wheelbar∣row; some of which were roasting in a little fire pot contrived for the purpose; when two genteel looking boys came up and demanded the price of some golden pippins. The wom∣an, as she was going to answer them, discov∣ered that her child, who had been sitting by her on a little wooden stool, had wandered to some distance, and was going to cross the street by itself; to prevent which, she ran im∣mediately to overtake it, and in the mean time, one of the mischievous boys, with a kick over∣set her wheelbarrow, and tumbled its con∣tents into the mud. The laugh of exultation which these young miscreants set up on the oc∣casion, and the sight of the rolling oranges, and mashed half roasted apples, swimming down the kennel, exceedingly diverted my
<PB N="100" REF="021188_0096_0FB29F68D260F8A8"/>
master and his brother; until the unfortunate owner at her return, began her pity moving complaints. A croud having gathered round her, many of them laughed at the accident, and some ran away with the spoils, and began peeling the oranges they had picked up. Oth∣ers blamed the unlucky monkey (as they called the boy) who had occasioned the mis∣chief. Matters, however, being once more quiet, Mr. <HI>Jackson</HI> called the poor woman, and enquired into her situation. Why, sir! said she, I will tell you the truth! You see me re∣duced to the last farthing I have in the world; for this morning I laid out four shillings, which was all the money I was worth, in these oranges, apples, and chesnuts, and I declare I have tak∣en but threepence to day; and I have three children, the eldest but six years old, besides this little one, whom I was going to run after when that wicked boy kicked down my barrow. It is a hard case, Sir! said she, the tears run∣ning down her cheeks, which she wiped off with an old rag of coloured apron; and I
<PB N="101" REF="021188_0097_0FB29F6A4B914208"/>
owe for my rent, Sir! and shall be turned with all my babes into the street, as I have now lost the two shillings, which I promised to carry home to my landlord; and he told me before I came out, <HI>that</HI> should be the case, as he would not trust me any longer. But it is a shocking thing to see my children cry for a mouthful of victuals, and not have it to give them; and so I bought last night a quartern loaf, instead of paying him, which I did intend, but now I have nothing to give him; and we must go to the parish, after all my labour to get an honest livelihood, having endeavoured all my life not to be a burden to any body. Mr. <HI>Jackson,</HI> however made up her loss, and the coach once more proceeded on its <HI>journey. Frederick</HI> de∣clared, he thought the boy was to blame to in∣jure the woman; but added, that he could not help laughing to see the distance to which some of the pippins had rolled, and the scramble <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they occasioned among the mob; that a chimney sweeper had slipped down over an orange, which he kicked away to prevent a girl
<PB N="102" REF="021188_0098_0FB29F726D3EDED8"/>
from seizing; and with his bag of foot, had fal∣len against a lady in a white jacket, and made her as black as himself; and that the gentle∣man who was with her, had rapped the boy's
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
head with his cane, and set him a howling like a cur. In short, continued he, it was rare fun! and I think, had not the woman been so <HI>very</HI> poor, it was worth the money to see the confusion which it occasioned.</P>
<P>I am sorry, replied his father with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> air, that the pleasure with which you surveyed that confusion, has made you forget the suffer∣ings
<PB N="103" REF="021188_0099_0FB29F742AA7B550"/>
which it <HI>might</HI> have caused to the person, whose living depends upon the success of her little trade. Every one has a right to <HI>justice,</HI> be their situation in life ever so low; and it is an additional degree of guilt to injure those, who stand most in need of protection. It can∣not therefore, in my mind, be considered as any proof of <HI>cleverness</HI> or <HI>wit,</HI> to see a boy throw down a barrow of fruit, overset a stall of gin∣gerbread, trip up an old woman's heels, or perform any of those feats of dexterity, which are apt to afford mirth to the giddy and incon∣siderate; since to do a fellow creature a mate∣rial injury, for the sake of sporting with their misfortunes, is to be wicked and inhuman; but is by no means entitled to commendation and applause. If you had been one of the children who was to be turned out of doors, or to loo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> your day's victuals in consequence of this <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> exploit, I am apt to think you would form a different judgment of its merit, and be ready to execrate that wantonness of invention, which can so unthinkingly sport with the uneasiness
<PB N="104" REF="021188_0100_0FB29E1ED428D3E0"/>
of others. Never, therefore, let the <HI>fun,</HI> or entertainment of such jokes make you insen∣sible to the serious mischiefs they may produce; and remember, that what, like the fable of the <HI>boys</HI> and <HI>frogs,</HI> may be <HI>play</HI> to you, is misery perhaps to those whose property you so abuse. I recollect, added he, an instance of this kind, when I was at school, which produced such a dismal event as I shall never forget.</P>
<P>An old woman who lived in a cottage in the neighbourhood, and whose character was as qui∣et, good, and inoffensive as you can imagine; was nevertheless, singled out by the boys, as a proper subject for their <HI>fun.</HI> She was very short and a little crooked, bent down with age and infirmities, and was guilty of the shocking crime of <HI>wearing a high crowned hat:</HI> which had perhaps been in vogue in the days of her youth. This was so high an offence, that they gave her the appellation of the <HI>Old Witch,</HI> and by this name she was universally known. Stigmatized with such an epithet of derision, they thought there was no harm in making
<PB N="105" REF="021188_0101_0FB29E20C7269100"/>
her life unhappy, by every art which their in∣vention could devise. They broke the only window of her cot, and as soon as it was repair∣ed, repeated the offence. A couple of she asses which she kept to supply the neighbours with milk, and which were her chief support, they drove every day to a distance, into such places as they thought she would least think of search∣ing for them; and this, as she was <HI>lame,</HI> was a constant uneasiness to her. Several times they nailed up the door of her hut, and when she was absent, would pile up all the rubbish they could procure, to obstruct her entrance; and when she made any complaints of these in∣sults to their masters, they considered it as an unpardonable provocation, and vowed their vengeance for her ill nature. At length they determined on a scheme, which they thought would effectually frighten the <HI>Old Witch,</HI> and make her fears afford them a subject of mirth.</P>
<P>This was, after she went to bed (which was usually at an early hour) to make a bonfire be∣fore her window; the flames of which would
<PB N="106" REF="021188_0102_0FB29E21CABBD938"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
confirm her in the apprehension, that her dwel∣ling was on fire, as they intended to make an outcry to that purpose. Accordingly the poor creature, who had fatigued herself in the day with washing, was soon asleep; and they came with washing, was soon asleep; and they came with much satisfaction to execute their project. The fuel they had brought was soon in a blaze; and several of them knocked with violence at the door, and cried out that she would be burnt to death if she did not make her escape. She im∣mediately jumped out of bed, and in her haste and surprise, stumbled over a small washing tub,
<PB N="107" REF="021188_0103_0FB29E2347503528"/>
in which she had left some unfinished clothes: by which accident she broke her leg, and was so ill in consequence of it, that though she linger∣ed above a twelvemonth after, it was thought to be, in some degree, the cause of her death. The <HI>design</HI> of these boys, by no means extended so far as to do her a real injury; but there is no cer∣tainty that a mischievous intention will stop <HI>ex∣actly</HI> where it was projected; and therefore a good natured disposition, will rather lose the enjoyment of a <HI>joke</HI> than run the hazard of hurt∣ing a fellow creature.</P>
<P>As Mr. <HI>Jackson</HI> concluded this sentence, they arrived at the end of their journey. They were immediately introduced into a handsome draw∣ing room, where a large party was assembled; among which was a boy about the age of master <HI>Edward,</HI> with whom he and his brother soon quitted the apartmant, and retired to the dining parlour, where I was produced, with great praises of my merit. But a difficulty now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, as I could not spin upon the carpet. This therefore, they agreed to turn back and without
<PB N="108" REF="021188_0104_0FB29E2656681580"/>
considering the holes my peg would make in the floor, they began to spin me by turns, and con∣tinued to entertain themselves, until a footman came to lay the cloth for dinner. He blamed the young gentlemen for the liberty they had taken, and said, his mistress would be much dis∣pleased, and insisted upon their finding a more proper place for their amusement. After de∣bating the matter some time, they agreed to ad∣journ to the library; where, as soon as they ar∣rived, I was laid on a writing desk, as their at∣tention was engaged by the pictures of a folio, which was open on a table. The pleasure they found in this examination made them forget me; and when they were summoned to attend the company, they, in their haste, left me behind; and the leisure I there enjoyed, suggested the idea of communicating an account of myself to the world. Whether the recital will afford any satisfaction to the youthful readers, I must leave with them to determine.</P>
