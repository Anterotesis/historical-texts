<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ALTHO' the following Account of what GOD has done for my Soul, will, un∣doubtedly, be differently judged of, by different People; yet, as, I trust, a single Eye to</HI> GOD'S <HI>Glory moved me to write, and as I find myself much pressed in Spirit to publish it, I am not in the least solicitous about the Treat∣ment it will meet with in the World.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Benefit I have received from Reading the Lives of good Men; the Examples we have in Scripture of the Sacred Authors composing their own Histories; and, more especially the Assistances I have received from the</HI> Holy Spirit, <HI>in bringing many Things to my Remembrance, which otherwise I should have forgotten, seemed to me Reasons suffi∣cient to justify my Conduct, in the Sight of GOD and all good Men.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Further, As GOD has been pleased of late to call me to a</HI> Publick Work, <HI>I thought his Children would be glad to know how I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> trained up for it. And, tho' some may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this had been as well deferr'd till after
<PB N="ii" REF="004626_0003_100D861F72E73830"/>
my Death, or wrote by some other Person; yet, I thought it would be more beneficial, and be better credited, if wrote with my own Hand, and published whilst I was yet alive.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In the Accounts of good Men, which I have read, I have observed, that the Writers of them have been partial: They have given us the</HI> bright, <HI>but not the</HI> black <HI>Side of their Characters. This, I think, proceeds from carnal Reasoning, lest mentioning the Person's Faults should encourage others in Sin. It cannot, I am sure, proceed from that Wisdom which cometh from above. The sacred Wri∣ters give an Account of their Failings, as well as their Virtues:</HI> Peter <HI>is not ashamed to confess, that with Oaths and Curses he thrice denied his Master; nor do the Evan∣gelists make any Scruple of telling, that out of</HI> Mary Magdalen JESUS CHRIST <HI>cast seven Devils.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I fearing, therefore, lest my surviving Friends should not be thus impartial in giving an Account of me, was resolved (among other Reasons) to give the following Account of myself, that those who now have my Per∣son too much in Admiration, seeing what once I was, may learn not to think more highly of me than they ought to think: That th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se who are awaken'd to a Sense of Sin, may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t de∣spair; since for this Cause I obtained Mercy that in me</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort
<PB N="iii" REF="004626_0004_100D862E3581C8D0"/>
all long Suffering, for a Pattern to them who should hereafter believe on him to Life everlasting. And, finally, that all true Lo∣vers of GOD may join in hearty Thanks and Praises to the most adorable Trinity, for Pluck∣ing such a Firebrand out of the Burning.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As I have often wished, when in my best Frame, that the first Years of my Life might be put down as a Blank, and had no more in Remembrance; so I could almost wish now to pass them over in Silence. But, as they will, in some Degree, illustrate GOD's Dealing with me in my riper Years, I shall, as I am able, give the following brief Account of them.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Mr. WHITEFIELD'S Brief ACCOUNT of the First Part OF HIS LIFE.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>From my Infancy, 'till my being for some Time at the University.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> WAS born in <HI>Gloucester</HI> in the Month of <HI>December,</HI> 1714. My Father and Mother kept the <HI>Bell-Inn:</HI> The former died when I was two Years old, the latter is now alive; and has often told me, how she endured fourteen Weeks Sickness after she brought me into the World; but was used to say, even when I was an Infant, that she expected more Comfort from me than any other of her Children. This, with the Circumstance of my being born in an Inn, has been often of Service to me, in exciting me to make good my Mother's
<PB N="2" REF="004626_0006_100D867D64CE39D8"/>
Expectations; and to follow the Example of my dear Saviour, who was born in a Stable, and laid in a Manger belonging to an Inn.</P>
<P>My very infant Years must necessarily not be mentioned: Yet I can remember such early Stirrings of Corruption in my Heart, as abundantly convince me, that <HI>I was conceived and born in Sin;</HI> that in me dwelleth no good Thing by Nature; and, that if GOD had not freely preven∣ted me by his Grace, I must have been forever banished from his divine Presence.</P>
<P>I can truly say, I was froward from my Mother's Womb: I was so brutish as to hate Instruction, and used purposely to shun all Opportunities of receiving it. I can date some very early Acts of Unclean∣ness. I soon gave pregnant Proofs of an impudent Temper. Lying, filthy Talking, and foolish Jesting, I was much addicted to, even when very young. Sometimes I used to Curse, if not Swear. Stealing from my Mother I thought no Theft at all, and therefore used to make no Scruple of Steal∣ing Money out of her Pocket before she was up; and have more than once spent Money I took in the House in buying Fruits, Tarts, &amp;c. to satisfy my sensual Appetite. I was never much given to Fighting; but that, I fear, rather proceeded
<PB N="3" REF="004626_0007_100D86822CC79F80"/>
from Cowardice, than a Principle of Meekness, or a good Temper. Numbers of <HI>Sabbaths</HI> have I broken; and generally used to behave myself very irreverently in GOD's <HI>Sanctuaries.</HI> Much Money have I spent in Plays, and in the common En∣tertainments of the Age. Cards, and Read∣ing Romances were my Heart's Delight. Often have I joined with others in Playing roguish Tricks; but was generally, if not always, happily detected; for which I have often since, and do now, praise GOD.</P>
<P>It would be endless to recount the Sins and Offences of my younger Days; they are more in Number than the Hairs of my Head; my Heart would fail me at the Remembrance of them, was I not assured that my Redeemer liveth ever to make In∣tercession for me. However the young Man in the Gospel might boast, that he had <HI>kept,</HI> yet (with Shame and Confusion of Face) I confess, that all GOD's Com∣mandments I have <HI>broken</HI> from my Youth. Whatever foreseen Fitness others may boast of for Salvation (if I trace myself from my Cradle to my Manhood) I can see nothing in me but a Fitness to be damned. And, if GOD had not quicken∣ed me by his Free Spirit when dead in Trespasses and Sins, and irresistibly worked upon my Soul, I had now either been sit∣ting.
<PB N="4" REF="004626_0008_100D8684E082E810"/>
in Darkness and in the Shadow of Death, or been condemned, as the due Reward of my Crimes, to be forever lifting up my Eyes i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Torments.</P>
<P>But, such was the Free Grace of GOD to me, that tho' Corruption worked so strongly in my Soul, and produced such early and bitter Fruits; yet, I can recol∣lect very early Movings of the Blessed Spirit upon my Heart, sufficient to satisfy me that GOD loved me with an everlasting Love, and separated me (even from my Mo∣ther's Womb) for the Work to which he afterwards was pleased to call me.</P>
<P>I had early some Convictions of Sin; and once, I remember, when Persons (as they frequently did) made it their Business to tantalize me, I immediately retired to my Room and kneeled down, and with many Tears, prayed over that Psalm wherein <HI>David</HI> so often repeats these Words, <HI>But in the Name of the LORD will I destroy them.</HI> I was always fond of being a Cler∣gyman; I used frequently to imitate the Minister's Reading Prayers, and to make little Sermons in little Books about as long as my Finger. Part of the Money I used to steal from my Parents, I gave to the Poor, and some Books I privately took from others (for which I have since returned Four-fold) I remember were Books of Devotion.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="004626_0009_100D8688687E7868"/>
My Mother was very careful of my Education, put me out to two different Schools to board, and always kept me in my tender Years (for which I can never sufficiently thank her) from inter∣meddling in the least with publick Busi∣ness.</P>
<P>About the tenth Year of my Age, it pleased GOD to permit my Mother to marry a second Time. It proved what the World would call an unhappy Match, as to temporal Things; but GOD over∣ruled it for Good. It set many of my Brethren upon thinking more than other∣wise they would have done, and made an uncommon Impression upon my own Heart in particular.</P>
<P>When I was about Twelve, I was placed at a School called <HI>St. Mary de Cryps,</HI> in <HI>Gloucester,</HI> the last G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> School I ever went to. Having a good Elocution and Memory, I was remark'd for my making Speeches before the Cor∣poration at their annual Visitations: But I cannot say I felt any Drawings of GOD upon my Soul, for a Year or two, saving, that I laid out some of the Money, that was given me on one of the fore-menti∣oned Occasions, in Buying <HI>Ken's Manual for Winchester Scholars,</HI> a Book that had much affected me, when my Brother used
<PB N="6" REF="004626_0010_100D868B1A557098"/>
to read it in my Mother's Troubles, and which, for some Time after I bought it, was of great Benefit to my Soul.</P>
<P>During the Time of my being at School, I was very fond of Reading Plays; and have kept from School for Days together, to prepare myself for acting them. My Master, seeing how mine and my School-Fellows Vein run, compos'd Something of this Kind for us himself, and caused <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to dress myself in Girl's Cloaths (which I had often done) to act a Part before the Corporation; a Thing which ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and, I trust, will still cause me much Sorrow, even to the End of my Life.</P>
<P>For, though GOD brought Good af∣terwards, even out of this Evil, as it was a Means of strengthening my Memory, and teaching me a proper Gesture in Speaking; yet, this Way of Training up Youth, has a natural Tendency to de∣bauch the Mind, to raise ill Passions, and to stuff the Memory with Things as con∣trary to the Gospel of JESUS CHRIST as Darkness to Light, Hell to Heaven: How∣ever, though the first Thing I had to re∣pent of, was my Education in general; yet, I must always acknowledge, my par∣ticular Thanks are due to my Master, for the great Pains he took with me and the other Scholars, in teaching us to speak and write correctly.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="004626_0011_100D869095ABAF08"/>
Before I was Fifteen, having, as I thought, made a sufficient Progress in the Classicks, and secretly longing to be set at Liberty from the Confinement of a School, I one Day told my Mother, since her Circumstances would not permit to give me an University Education, more Learn∣ing, I thought, would spoil me for a Tradesman; and therefore I judg'd it best, not to learn Latin any longer. She at first refused to consent; but my Corruption soon got the better of her good Nature. Hereupon, for some Time, I went to learn to write only. But my Mother's Circum∣stances being much on the Decline, and I being tractable that Way, I from Time to Time, began to assist her occasionally in the Publick House, till at length, I put on my blue Apron and my Snuffers, wash'd Mops, clean'd Rooms, and, in one Word, became a professed and common Drawer for near a Year and an half.</P>
<P>But he, who was with <HI>David</HI> when he was following the Sheep big with young, was with me even here. For notwith∣standing I was thus employed in a com∣mon Inn, and had sometimes the Care of the whole House upon my Hands; yet I composed two or three Sermons, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> one of them, in particular, to my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Brother. One Time, I remember,
<PB N="8" REF="004626_0012_100D86936B787AA0"/>
I was much pressed to Self-Examination, and found myself very unwilling, at first, to look into my Heart. And when a dear Youth (now with GOD) would of∣ten come intreating me, when serving at the Bar, to go to <HI>Oxon;</HI> my general An∣swer was, <HI>I wish I could.</HI></P>
<P>And He, that has promised to fulfil the Desires of them that fear him, was pleased to fulfil this Desire his holy Spirit had put into my Heart.</P>
<P>When I had been employed above a Year in this servile Manner, my Mother was obliged to leave the Inn. My Bro∣ther, who had been bred up for the Busi∣ness, married. All was made over to him. I being accustom'd to the House, it was agreed on all Hands, that I should continue there as an Assistant. But GOD's Thoughts were not as our Thoughts; by his good Providence it happened, that my Sister-in-Law and I could by no Means agree; and at length the Resent∣ment grew to such an Height, that my proud Heart would scarce suffer me to speak to her for three Weeks together: But, notwithstanding I was much to blame, yet I used to retire and weep, as <HI>Hagar</HI> did before the LORD, little think∣ing, that GOD, by this Means, was forc∣ing me out of the Publick-Business, and
<PB N="9" REF="004626_0013_100D86958A965B90"/>
calling me from drawing Wine for Drunkards, to draw Water out of the Wells of Salvation, for the Refreshment of his spiritual <HI>Israel.</HI> After continuing a long Time under this Burden of Mind, I at length resolved, thinking my Absence would make all Things easy, to go away: Accordingly, by the Advice of my Bro∣ther, and Consent of my Mother, I went to see my elder Brother, then settled at <HI>Bristol.</HI></P>
<P>And here GOD was pleased to give me great Foretastes of his Love, and filled me with such unspeakable Raptures in <HI>St. John'</HI>s Church, that I was carried out even beyond myself. I felt great Hungrings and Thirstings after the blessed Sacra∣ment, and wrote many pious Letters to my Mother, telling her, I would never go into the publick Employ again. <HI>Kem∣pis</HI> was my great Delight, and I was al∣ways impatient, till the Bell rung to call me to tread the Courts of the LORD'S House: But, in the Midst of these Illu∣minations, something secretly whisper'd, this would not last.</P>
<P>And indeed so it happened: For (Oh that I could write it in Tears of Blood!) when I left <HI>Bristol</HI> (as I did in about two Months) and returned to <HI>Gloucester,</HI> I changed my Devotion with my Place.
<PB N="10" REF="004626_0014_100D869A82235148"/>
Alas, all my Fervour went off! I had no Inclination to go to Church or draw nigh unto GOD. In short, my Heart (tho' I had so lately tasted of his Love) was far from him.</P>
<P>However, I had so much Religion left, as to persist in my Resolution not to live in the Inn: And therefore my Mother gave me leave, tho' she had but a little Income, to have a Bed upon the Ground, and live at her House, till Providence should point out a Place for me.</P>
<P>Having now, as I thought, Nothing to do, it was a proper Season for Satan to tempt me. Much of my Time I spent in reading Plays, and in saunt'ring from Place to Place. I was careful to adorn my Body, but took little Pains to deck and beautify my Soul. Evil Communi∣cations, with my old School-Fellows, soon corrupted my good Manners. By seeing their evil Practices, a Sense of the divine Presence and past Convictions insensibly wore off my Mind; and I at length fell secretly into a Sin, for which <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> died; the dismal Effects of which I have felt and groaned under ever since.</P>
<P>But GOD, whose Gifts and Callings are without Repentance, would let No∣thing pluck me out of his Hands, tho' I was continually opposing the <HI>Spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="11" REF="004626_0015_100D869EB573A3B8"/>
Grace.</HI> He saw me, with Pity and Com∣passion, when lying in my Blood. He passed by me; He said unto me, LIVE; and even then gave me some Foresight of his Providing for me.</P>
<P>One Morning, as I was reading a Play to my Sister, said I, <HI>Sister, I believe GOD intends Something for me, which we know not of. As I have been diligent in Business, I believe many would gladly have me for an Apprentice; but every Way seems to be barr'd up, so that GOD, I think, will provide for me some Way or other.</HI></P>
<P>How I came to say these Words, I know not. GOD afterwards shewed me they came from him; for, having lived thus with my Mother for a considerable time, a young Student, who was once a School-Fellow, and then a Servitor of <HI>Pembroke-College, Oxon,</HI> came to pay my Mother a Visit. Among other Conver∣sation he told her, how he had discharged all College Expences that Quarter, and received a Penny. Upon this, my Mo∣ther immediately cried out, <HI>That will do for me.</HI> Then turning to me, she said, <HI>Will you go to</HI> Oxford, George? <HI>Yes,</HI> I replied, <HI>with all my Heart.</HI> Whereupon, having the same Friends as this Student had, my Mother, without Delay, waited upon them. They promised their Interest
<PB N="12" REF="004626_0016_100D86A383139518"/>
to get me a Servitor's Place in the same College. She then applied to my old Master, who much approv'd of my com∣ing to School again.</P>
<P>In about a Week I went and re-enter'd myself, and being grown pretty much in Stature, my Master addressed me thus, <HI>I see</HI> George, <HI>you are advanced in Stature, but your better Part must needs have gone back∣wards.</HI> This made me blush. He set me a proper Theme to translate into La∣tin; and tho' I had made no Application to my Classicks for so long a Time, yet I had but one inconsiderable Fault in my Exercise. This, I believe, somewhat sur∣prized my Master, and has afforded me Matter of Praise and Thanks ever since.</P>
<P>Being re-settled at School, I spared no Pains to go forward in my Book. GOD was pleased to give me his Blessing; and I learnt much faster than ever I did be∣fore.</P>
<P>All this while I continued in secret Sin; and at length got acquainted with a Set of such debauched, abandoned, atheisti∣cal Youths, that if GOD, by his free, unmerited, distinguishing Grace, had not delivered me out of their Hands, I should, long since, have sat in the Scorner's Chair, My Thoughts of Religion, insensibly grew more and more lax. I went to
<PB N="13" REF="004626_0017_100D86A60AB3DE40"/>
publick Service only to make Game and walk about. I took Pleasure in their lewd Conversation. I began to reason, as they did; and to ask, Why GOD had given me Passions, and not permitted me to gratify them? Not considering, that GOD did not, originally, give us these corrupt Passions; and that he had promis∣ed Help to withstand them, if we would ask it of him. In short, I soon made a great Proficiency in the School of the Devil. I affected to look rakish, and was in a fair Way of being as infamous as the worst of them.</P>
<P>But (Oh stupendous Love!) GOD even here stopped me, when running on in a full Career to Hell. For, just as I was upon the Brink of Ruin, he gave me such a Distaste of their Principles and Practices, that I discovered them to my Master, who soon put a Stop to their Pro∣ceedings.</P>
<P>Being thus delivered out of the Snares of the Devil, I began to be more and more serious; and felt GOD convicting and working upon my Soul in some small Degree. One Day, as I was coming down Stairs, and overheard my Friends speaking well of me, GOD so deeply con∣victed me of my Hypocrisy, that tho' I had formed frequent, but ineffectual Reso∣lutions
<PB N="14" REF="004626_0018_100D86AA93E8C570"/>
before, yet I had then Power gi∣ven me, over my secret and darling S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. Notwithstanding, some time afterwards, being overtaken in Liquor (as I have been twice or thrice in my Life time) Satan gained his usual Advantage over me again. An experimental Proof to my poor Soul, how that wicked One makes Use of Men as Machines, to work up to just what he pleases, when by Intempe∣rance they have chased the Spirit of GOD from them.</P>
<P>Being now near the Seventeenth Year of my Age, I was resolved to prepare my∣self for the Holy Sacrament; which I re∣ceived on Christmas-Day. I began now to be more and more watchful over my Thoughts, Words and Actions: I kept the following Lent, Fasting <HI>Wednesdays</HI> and <HI>Fridays,</HI> thirty six Hours together. My Evenings (when I had done waiting upon my Mother) were generally spent in Acts of Devotion, reading <HI>Drelincourt</HI> up∣on Death, and other practical Books; and I constantly went to publick Worship twice a Day. Being now Upper Boy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> GOD's Help, I made some Reformation among my School-Fellows. Was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> diligent in Reading and Learning the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>∣sicks, and in Studying my <HI>Greek</HI> Testa∣ment: But was not yet convinced of the
<PB N="15" REF="004626_0019_100D86AEA9B6C1B8"/>
<HI>absolute</HI> Unlawfulness of Playing Cards, Reading and Seeing Plays; tho' I begun to have some Scruples about them.</P>
<P>Near this Time I dream'd, That <HI>I was to see</HI> GOD <HI>on Mount</HI> Sinai; <HI>but was afraid to meet him.</HI> This made a great Impression upon me: A Gentlewoman to whom I told it, said, George <HI>this is a Call from</HI> GOD.</P>
<P>Still I grew more serious after this Dream; but yet Hypocrisy crept into every Action. As once I affected to look more Rakish, I now strove to appear more Grave than really I was. However, an uncommon Concern and Alteration were visible in my Behaviour. I often used to find fault with the Lightness of others, and sometimes took upon me to reprove my elder Brethren.</P>
<P>Not long after, as I was going one Night on an Errand for my Mother, an unac∣countable, but very strong Impression was made upon my Heart, that I should <HI>preach</HI> and <HI>print</HI> quickly. When I came home I innocently told my Mother what had befallen me: But she (like <HI>Joseph'</HI>s Parents, when he told them his Dream) turning short upon me, cried out, <HI>What does the Boy mean? Prithee hold thy Tongue;</HI> or something to that Purpose. Since, GOD has shewn her from whom those Impres∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> came.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="004626_0020_100D86B22C033258"/>
For a Twelve-Month I went on in a Round of Duties, receiving the Sacrament monthly, Fasting frequently, attending constantly on publick Worship, and Pray∣ing often more than twice a Day in pri∣vate. One of my Brothers used to tell me, he fear'd this would not hold long, and that I would forget all when I came to <HI>Oxford.</HI> This Caution did me much Service; it fet me upon Praying to GOD for Perseverance: And, under GOD, the Preparation I made in the Country was an excellent Preservative against those mani∣fold Temptations which beset me at my first coming to that Seat of Learning.</P>
<P>Being near Eighteen, it was judged a proper Time for my going to the Univer∣sity. GOD had sweetly prepared my Way. The Friends before applied to, recommen∣ded me to the Master of <HI>Pembroke-College;</HI> another Friend took up <HI>Ten Pounds</HI> upon Bond (which I have since paid) to defray the first Expences of Entering; and the Master (contrary to all Expectations) ad∣mitted me Servitor immediately.</P>
<P>Soon after my Admission, I went to re∣side (and found my being) at a Publick House was of Service to me: For, all the Servitors being sick at my first coming up, by my diligent and speedy Attendance, I ingratiated myself into the Gentlemens
<PB N="17" REF="004626_0021_100D86B46FDDEBE8"/>
Favour so far, that many, who had it in their own Power, chose me to be their Servitor. This much lessen'd my Ex∣pence: And, indeed, GOD was so good to me, that with the Profits of my Place, and some little Presents made me by my kind Tutor, for almost the Three first Years, I did not put all my Relations together to above <HI>Eight Pounds</HI> Expence <HI>per Ann.</HI> And it has often grieved my Soul, to see so many young Men spending their Sub∣stance in extravagant Living, and there∣by entirely unfitting themselves for the Prosecution of their Studies.</P>
<P>I had not been long here, before I found the Benefit of the Foundation I had laid in the Country for a Holy Life. I was quick∣ly solicited to join with several, who lay in the same Room, in their Excess of Riot. GOD, in answer to my Prayers, gave me Grace to withstand them; and, once in particular, it being cold, my Thighs were so benumb'd by Sitting alone in my Study, because I would not go out amongst them, that I could scarce sleep all Night. But I soon found the Benefit of not Yielding: For, when they perceived they could not prevail, they let me alone for a singular, comical Fellow.</P>
<P>All this while I was not fully satisfied of the Sin of Playing at Cards, and Reading of
<PB N="18" REF="004626_0022_100D883C5CBD8758"/>
Plays, 'til GOD, upon a Fast-Day, was pleased to convince me: For taking the Play called <HI>George Barnwell,</HI> to read a Pas∣sage out of it to a Friend, GOD struck my Heart with such Power, that I was obliged to lay it down; and, blessed be his Name, I have never read any such Book since.</P>
<P>Before I went to the University, I met with Mr. Law's <HI>Serious Call to a devout Life;</HI> but had not then Money enough to purchase it. Soon after my coming up to the University, I seeing a small Edition of it in a Friend's Hand, soon procured it. GOD worked powerfully upon my Soul, as he has since upon many others, by that and his other Treatise upon Christian Per∣fection; for which I desire to bless his Holy Name.</P>
<P>I now began to pray and sing Psalms thrice every Day, besides Morning and Evening; to fast every <HI>Friday;</HI> and to re∣ceive the Sacrament at a Parish-Church near our College, and at the Castle where the despised <HI>Methodists</HI> used to receive once a Month.</P>
<P>The young Men so called, were then much talked of at <HI>Oxford:</HI> I had heard of and loved them, before I came to the Uni∣versity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so strenuously defended them, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the Students, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that I also, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> be one of them.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="004626_0023_100D883F22D90D10"/>
For above a Twelvemonth, my Soul <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ged to be acquainted with them, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was strongly pressed to follow their good example, when I saw them go through a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>diculing Crowd to receive the holy Eu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>arist at St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s. At length GOD <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as pleased to open a Door. It happened <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a poor Woman, in one of the Work∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ouses, had attempted to cut her Throat, it was happily prevented. I hearing of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>is, and knowing that both of the Mr. <HI>Wesleys</HI> were famous for being ready <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> very good Work, sent a poor aged Apple-Woman of our College, to inform Mr. <HI>Charles Wesley</HI> of it, charging her not t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>scover who sent her. She went, but, contrary to my Orders, discovered my name. He having heard of my coming <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Castle and Parish-Church Sacra∣ment, and having met with me walking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>equently by myself, followed the Wo∣man when she was gone away, and sent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Invitation to me, by her, to come and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>akfast with him the next Morning.</P>
<P>I thankfully embraced the Opportunity: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <HI>blessed be GOD,</HI> it was one of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> profitable Visits I ever made in my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. My Soul, at that Time, was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for some spiritual Friends to lift up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Hands when they hung down, and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my feeble Knees. He soon
<PB N="20" REF="004626_0024_100D884294098828"/>
discovered it, and, like a wise Winner of Souls, made all his Discourse tend that Way; and after he had put into my Hands <HI>Frank's</HI> Treatise against <HI>the Fear of Man,</HI> and a Book, entitled, <HI>The Country Parson's Advice to his Parishioners,</HI> the last of which was wonderfully blessed to my Soul, I took my Leave.</P>
<P>In a short Time after, he let me have another Book, entitled, <HI>The Life of GOD in the Soul of Man.</HI> And, tho' I had fasted, watched, and prayed, and received the Sacrament so long, yet I never knew what true Religion was, till GOD sent me that excellent Treatise, by the Hands of my never to be forgotten Friend Mr. <HI>Charles Wesley.</HI></P>
<P>At my first Reading it, I wondered what the Author meant by saying, That <Q>some falsly placed Religion in going to Church, doing Hurt to no one, being constant in the Duties of the Closet, and now and then reaching out their Hands to give Alms to their Neigh∣bours.</Q> Alas! thought I, <HI>if this be not Religion, What is?</HI> GOD soon shew∣ed me: For reading in a few Lines fol∣lowing, <HI>That TRUE Religion was an Union of the Soul with GOD, and CHRIST formed within us;</HI> a Ray of divine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> broke in upon my Soul, and from that

Moment, but not till then, did I know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at I must be a <HI>New-Creature.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this, like the Woman, when CHRIST revealed himself to her at the Well, I had no Rest in my Soul till I wrote Letters to my Relations, telling them there was such a Thing as the <HI>New-Birth.</HI> I imagined they would gladly have received them; but alas! my Words <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>em'd to them as idle Tales, they tho't that I was going beside myself; and by their Letters, confirm'd me in the Reso∣lution I had taken up, not to go down into the Country, but continue where I was, to carry on the good Work GOD had begun in my Soul.</P>
<P>From time to time Mr. <HI>Wesley</HI> permit∣ted me to come unto him, and instructed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e as I was able to bear it. By Degrees <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e introduced me to the Rest of his Chris∣tian Brethren. They built me up daily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Knowledge and Fear of GOD; and taught me to endure Hardship, like; good Soldier of JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>I now began, like them, to live by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; and to pick up the very Fragments <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Time, that not a Moment of it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be lost. Whether I eat or drank, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whatsoever I did, I did all to the Glory <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> GOD. Like them, having no Week∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> (altho' the Rubrick requires

it) at our College, I received it even Sunday at <HI>Christ Church.</HI> I joined with them in keeping the Stations, by Fasting Wednesdays and Fridays; and left no Means unused, which I thought would lead me nearer to JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>Regular Retirement Morning and E∣vening I found some Difficulty in submit∣ting to, but it soon grew profitable and delightful. As I grew ripe for such Exer∣cises, I was from time to time engaged to visit the Sick and the Prisoners, and to read to poor People, till I made it a Cus∣tom, as most of us did, to spend an Hour every Day in doing Acts of Charity.</P>
<P>The Course of my Studies I soon en∣tirely changed: Whereas, before I was passed in studying the dry Sciences, and books that went no farther than the Sur∣face, I now resolved to read only such Books as enter'd into the Heart of Reli∣gion, and led me directly into an experi∣mental Knowledge of JESUS CHRIST and him crucified.</P>
<P>The lively Oracles of GOD were my Soul's Delight. The Book of the divine Laws was seldom out of my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> meditated therein Day and Night <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ever since that, GOD has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> prosperous, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Success.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="004626_0027_100D884A45323728"/>
Much Good GOD enabled me to do to, as well as to receive from, the despised <HI>Methodists;</HI> and made me instrumental in converting <HI>One,</HI> who is lately come into the Church, and I trust, will make a burn∣ing and a shining Light.</P>
<P>Several short Fits of Illness was GOD pleased to visit and try me with, after my first Acquaintance with Mr. <HI>Wesley.</HI> My new Convert was an Help-meet for me, in those and in every other Circumstance<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> And in Company with him and several other young Christian Heroes, did I spend many sweet and delightful Hours. Ne∣ver did Persons, I believe, strive more earnestly to enter in at the strait <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. They kept their Bodies under, even to an Extream. They were dead to the World, and willing to be counted as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Off-scouring of all Things, so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they might win CHRIST. Their Heart glowed with the Love of GOD; and they never prospered so much in the inward Man, as when they had all Manner of Evil spoke against them falsly without.</P>
<P>Many came amongst them for a while, who, in Time of Temptation, fell away.

that which cometh from GOD, and a servile Fear of Contempt, caused Num∣bers that had put their Hands to the Plow, shamefully to look back. The World, not themselves, gave them the Title of <HI>Methodists,</HI> I suppose, from their Custom of regulating their Time, and planning the Business of the Day every Morning. Mr. <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Charles Wesley</HI> were the first that thus openly dared to confess CHRIST; and they, under GOD, were the spiritual Fathers of most of them.

<HEAD>SECTION II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Brief and Summary Account of my Temptations.</HEAD>
<P>AT my first setting out, in Compassion to my Weakness, I grew in Favour both with GOD and Man; and used to be wrapped up with sensible Devotions, especially at the blessed Sacrament. But when Religion sunk from my Head into my Heart, and I was fully convinced my Soul must totally be renewed ere it could see GOD, I was visited with outward and inward Trials.</P>
<P>The first Thing I was called to give up for GOD, was, what the World calls, my fine Reputation. I had no sooner re∣ceived the Sacrament publickly, on a Week Day, at <HI>St. Mary's,</HI> but I was set up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Mark, for all the polite Students, that knew me, to shoot at. By <HI>this</HI> they knew I was commenced <HI>Methodist.</HI> For th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> there is a Sacrament at the Beginning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Term, at which all, especially <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, are by Statute obliged to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; yet so dreadfully has that once <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> City played the Harlot, that no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>, but those of <HI>that</HI> Way, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> upon it.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="004626_0030_100D88543472B648"/>
Mr. <HI>Charles Wesley</HI> (whom I must al∣ways mention with the greatest Deference and Respect) walked with me, in order to confirm me, from the Church even to the College. I confess, to my Shame, I would gladly have excused him. And the next Day, going to his Room, and one of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Fellows</HI> passing by, I was ashamed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to knock at his Door. But, <HI>bles∣sed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> GOD,</HI> this cursed Fear of Man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wore off. As I had imitated <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> in his Cowardice, so, by the divine Assistance, I followed him in his Courage. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> confess'd the <HI>Methodists</HI> more and more publickly every Day. I walked openly with them, and rather chose to endure contempt with those <HI>despised</HI> People of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, than enjoy the Applause of <HI>almost <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> for a Season.</P>
<P>Soon after this, I incurred the Displea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of the Master of the College, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> chid and once threat'ned to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me, if ever I visited the Poor again. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> surprized with his Treatment, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by his Authority, I spake <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with my Lips, and said, <HI>if it displeased him, I would not.</HI> My Conscience <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pricked me for this sinful Compliance. I immediately repented, visited the Poor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> first Opportunity; and told my Companions, if I was called to suffer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="27" REF="004626_0031_100D8855E07B8D40"/>
CHRIST'S Sake, I would do with my <HI>Tongue</HI> as Archbishop <HI>Granmer</HI> did with his <HI>Hands,</HI> make <HI>that</HI> burn first.</P>
<P>My Tutor, being a moderate Man, did not oppose me much; but thought, I be∣lieve, that I went a little too far. He lent me Books, gave me Money, visited and furnished me with a Physician when sick. In short, he behaved, in all Re∣spects, like a Father; and, I trust, GOD will remember him for Good, in answer to those many Prayers I have put up in his Behalf.</P>
<P>My Relations were quickly alarmed at the Alteration of my Behaviour, conceived strong Prejudices against me, and for some Time counted my Life but Madness.</P>
<P>I daily underwent some Contempt at College. Some have thrown at me; o∣thers, by Degrees, took their Pay from me; and two Friends, who were, dear to me, grew shy of and forsook me, what they saw me resolved to deny myself, take up my Cross daily, and follow JESUS CHRIST: But our LORD, by his Spirit, soon convinced me, that I must not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> after the Flesh. And I soon found that Promise literally fulfilled, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>That <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Father or Mother, Brethren or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Houses or Lands, for</HI> CHRIST <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Gospel, <HI>but what shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="28" REF="004626_0032_100D88589DD78AA8"/>
an Hundred-Fold in this Life, with</HI> Perse∣cution, <HI>as well as</HI> Eternal-Life <HI>in the World to come.</HI></P>
<P>These, tho' little, were useful Tryals. They inured me to Contempt, lessen'd Self-Love, and taught me to die daily. My inward Sufferings were of a more un∣common Nature. Satan seemed to have desired me in particular, to sift me as Wheat. GOD permitted him; for what Reason, I have seen already, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That his future Blessings might not prove my Ruin.</P>
<P>Ever since my first Awakenings to the divine Light, I felt a particular Hungring and Thirsting after the Humility of JESUS CHRIST. Night and Day I prayed to be Partaker of that Grace; imagining the Habit of Humility would be instantane∣ously infus'd into my Soul. But as <HI>Gideon</HI> taught the Men of <HI>Succoth</HI> by Thorns, so GOD (if I am yet in any Measure blessed with true Poverty of Spirit) taught it me by strong Temptations.</P>
<P>I observed before, how I used to be fa∣vour'd with sensible Devotions. Those Comforts were soon withdrawn, and an horrible Fearfulness and Dread permitted to overwhelm my Soul. One Morning, in particular, rising from my Bed, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an unusual Oppression and Weight upon my Breast, attended with inward Darkness.
<PB N="29" REF="004626_0033_100D885DA3D468B8"/>
I applied to my Friend Mr. <HI>Charles Wesley.</HI> He advised me to keep upon my Watch, and referr'd me to a Chapter in <HI>Kempis.</HI></P>
<P>In a short Time I perceived this Load gradually increased, till it almost weighed me down; and as fully convinced me, that Satan had as real a Possession given him of my Body, as he had over <HI>Job'</HI>s. All Power of Meditating, or even Think∣ing, was taken from me. My Memory quite fail'd me. My whole Soul was bar∣ren and dry; and I could fancy myself to be like Nothing, so much as a Man lock∣ed up in Iron Armour.</P>
<P>Whenever I kneeled down, I felt great Heavings in my Body; and have often prayed under the Weight of them, till the Sweat came through me. At these Times Satan used to terrify me much, and threatned to punish me if I discover∣ed his Wiles. It being my Business, as Servitor, in my Turn, to knock at the Gentlemen's Rooms by Ten at Night, to see who were in their Rooms, I thought the Devil would appear to me every Stair I went up; and he so troubled me when Play down to rest, that for some Months I scarce slept above three Hours in a Night.</P>
<P>GOD only knows how many Evenings I have lain upon my Bed, groaning under the Weight I felt, and bidding Satan
<PB N="30" REF="004626_0034_100D885F35834B88"/>
depart from me, in the Name of JESUS of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> Whole Days and Weeks have I spent in lying prostrate on the Ground, and begging for Freedom from those proud hellish Thoughts, which used to croud in upon and distract my Soul. But GOD made Satan drive out Satan. For these Thoughts and Suggestions raised such a Self-Abhorrence within me, that I never ceased wrestling with GOD, till he blessed me with a Victory over them. Self-Love, Self Will, Pride and Envy, so buffeted me in their Turns, that I was resolved either to die or conquer. I wanted to see Sin as it was; but feared, at the same Time, lest the Sight of it should terrify me to Death.</P>
<P>Whilst my <HI>inward</HI> Man was thus ex∣ercised, my <HI>outward</HI> Man was not unem∣ploy'd. I soon found what a Slave I had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to my sensual Appetite, and now re∣solved to get the Mastery over it, by the Help of JESUS CHRIST. Accordingly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Degrees, I began to leave off eating <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Fruit, and such like; and gave the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I usually spent in that Way, to the Poor. I always chose the worst Sort <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Food, tho' my Place furnish'd me with variety. I fasted twice a Week. My Apparel was very mean. I thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> unbecoming a Penitent to have his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="31" REF="004626_0035_100D8861560C5150"/>
powder'd. I wore woollen Gloves, a patch'd Gown and dirty Shoes. And tho' I was then, in some Degree, con∣vinced, that the Kingdom of GOD did not consist in Meats and Drinks; yet I resolutely persisted in these voluntary Acts of Self-Denial, because I found them great Promoters of the spiritual life.</P>
<P>For many Months I went on in the State before described <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> yet pursuing, travelling alone in the Dark, hoping that the Star I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> seen, would here∣after appear again. During this Season I was very active; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Pride creep in at the End of almost <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Thought, Word and Action, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with <HI>Cas∣taniza's Spiritual Combat,</HI> in which he says, <HI>That he that was employed he mortify∣ing his Will, was as well employed as tho' he was converting Indians,</HI> or Words to that Effect; Satan so imposed upon my Understanding, that he perswaded me to shut myself up in my Study, till I could do Good with a single Eye; lest in en∣deavouring to save others, as I did now I should at last, by Pride and Self-Com∣placence, lose myself.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> forward he transformed himself <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Angel of Light; and worked so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon my Understanding, that I <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the good,</HI> and not the <HI>evil</HI> Spirit,
<PB N="32" REF="004626_0036_100D8867AA46FB98"/>
suggested to me every Thing that I did.</P>
<P>His main Drift now, was to lead me into a State of <HI>Quietism.</HI> He generally plowed with GOD'S Heifer; and when the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> put into my Heart good Thoughts or Convictions, he always drove them to Extremes. For Instance, being check'd, for having, out of Pride, put down in my Diary what I gave away, Satan tempted me to lay my Diary quite aside. When <HI>Castaniza</HI> advised to talk but little, Satan said I must not talk at all: So that I, who used to be most forward in exhorting my Companions, have sat whole Nights without speaking scarce any Thing. Again, when <HI>Castaniza</HI> told me about keeping up a silent Recollection to GOD, Satan told me, I must leave off all Forms, and not use my Voice in Prayer at all. The Time would fail me, was I to recount all the Instances, of this Kind, in which he has deceived me.

<P>The Devil also sadly imposed upon me in doing my College Exercise. When∣ever I went to compose my Theme, my Head was like Brass. I had not Power to write a Word, nor tell my Christian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Friends of my Inability for so doing. Sa∣turday

being come (which is the Day the Students give up their Compositions) Sa∣tan (but, as I thought, the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI>) told me I must go down in the Hall, con∣fess I could not make a Theme, and so publickly suffer for my Master's Sake. When the Bell rung to call us, I went to open the Door to go down Stairs; but feeling something give me a violent in∣ward Check, I retired into my Study, and continued instant in Prayer, waiting the Event. My Tutor fined me Half a Crown. The next Week Satan served me so again. But having now got more Strength, and perceiving no inward Check, I went into the Hall. My Name being called, I stood up, and told my Tu∣tor I could not make a Theme. I think he fined me a second Time; but, know∣ing that I would not wilfully neglect my Exercise, he afterwards called me into the common Room, and kindly inquired whether any Misfortune had befallen me, or what was the Reason I could not make a Theme. I burst into a Flood of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, assured him, it was not out of Contempt of Authority, and that I could not act otherwise; then, at length, he said, he believed I could not. And when he left me, told a Friend (as he very well might) that he took me to be really <HI>mad.</HI> This

Friend, hearing from my Tutor what had happen'd, came to me, urging the Com∣mand in Scripture, <HI>to be subject to the higher Powers.</HI> I answered, <HI>YES, but I have a new Revelation.</HI> So artfully did the Devil lead me Captive at his Will. By <HI>this</HI> was I experimentally convinced, that my Understanding was not my own.</P>
<P>Further, as I daily got Strength by continued, tho' almost silent Prayer, in my Study, my Temptations grew stron∣ger, particularly for two or three Days before Deliverance came. Near five or six Weeks had I now spent in my Study, except when I was obliged to go out. During this Time, I was battling with my Corruptions, and did little else besides <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> down by my Bed-side, under great Loads upon my Body, and unspeak∣able Pressure of Mind, offering up my Soul to GOD thro' CHRIST, to stamp what he pleased upon it. Satan began now to suggest to me that JESUS CHRIST went among the wild Beasts when he was tempted, and that I ought to follow his Example. Whereupon, being willing to copy after JESUS CHRIST, after Supper I went into <HI>Christ-Church,</HI> walk'd near our College, and continued in silent Pray∣er, under one of the Trees, for near two Hours sometimes lying flat upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

Face, sometimes kneeling upon my Knees, all the while fearing Mr. <HI>John Wesley</HI> (who I knew was not far off reading the Holy Scripture to some young Gentlemen, at his Brother's Room) should be destroyed with Pride. It being a very blusterous, stormy Night, it gave me awful Thoughts of the Day of Judgment. I continued, I think, till <HI>Great Tom</HI> called me Home. And finding some Reluctance in the na∣tural Man against staying so long in the Cold, when I rose off my Knees, I fell a Rubbing my Hands, and hasted to Col∣lege, saying these Words, <HI>I am but a fresh Water Soldier.</HI></P>
<P>The next Night I repeated the same Exercise, at the same Place; but Satan (as he always does) now overshot, and there∣by discovered himself; or rather, the Hour of Extremity being come, GOD was pleased to interpose.</P>
<P>By this Time I had left off keeping my Diary, using any Forms or scarce my Voice in Prayer, visiting the Prisoners, &amp;c. Nothing remained for me to leave (unless I forsook Publick Worship, which I believe I should have done shortly) but my religious Friends. Satan now told me, that I must now even leave them for CHRIST'S Sake. This was a sore Trial; but rather than not be CHRIST'S Dis∣ciple

I was resolved to renounce them, tho' as dear to me as my own Soul. Ac∣cordingly, the next Day, being Wednes∣day, whereon we kept one of our Week∣ly Fasts, instead of meeting with my Bre∣thren, as usual, I went out into the Fields, and prayed silently by myself. Our Even∣ing Meeting I neglected also; and went not to Breakfast, according to Appoint∣ment, with Mr. <HI>Charles Wesly,</HI> the Day fol∣lowing. This, with many other concurring Circumstances, made my honoured Friend, Mr. <HI>Charles Wesly,</HI> suspect something more th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n ordinary to be the Matter. He came to my Room, soon found out my Case, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me of my Danger, if I would not take Advice, and recommended me to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Brother, as more experienced in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Life. GOD gave me (forever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be his holy Name) a teachable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> I waited upon his Brother, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, from that Time, I had the Honour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> intimate.

that is within me praise his holy Name!</HI></P>
<P>During this, and all other Seasons of Temptations, my Soul was inwardly sup∣ported with great Courage and Resolution from above. Every Day GOD made me willing to renew the Combat; and tho' my Soul, when quite empty of GOD, was very prone to seek Satisfaction in the Creature; yet I was generally enabled to sit in Silence, to wait for the Salvation of GOD; or to persist in Prayer, till some Gleams of inward Comfort were given me from on High. Sometimes I fell into Sensuality.</P>
<P><HI>Kempis</HI> (since translated and published by Mr. <HI>John Wesly) Castaniza's Spiritual Combat,</HI> and the <HI>Greek Testament,</HI> which I prayed over, Verse by Verse, every Day, were great Means of carrying me on. At the <HI>Holy Sacrament,</HI> especially before Trials, and just upon receiving the Elements, I have had <HI>Grace</HI> in an abun∣dant and very perceptible Manner im∣parted to my Soul. An irrefragable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to me, against the Doctrine of that de∣testable Book, called, <HI>The plain Account <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Sacrament of the LORD's Supper,</HI> which sinks that holy Ordinance into a bare Memorial. The Author without Repentance, shall bear his Punishment whosoever he be.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="004626_0042_100D8877F6DAC150"/>
To proceed, I had now taken up my <HI>Externals</HI> again. And tho' Satan, for some Weeks, had been bruising my Heel, GOD soon shewed me that I should bruise his Head. A few Days after, as I was walk∣ing along, I met a poor Woman, whose Husband was then in Bocardo, <HI>Oxford</HI> Town Goal, which I constantly visited. Seeing her much discompos'd, I enquired the Cause: She told me, not being able to bear the Cries of her Children, ready to perish for Hunger, and she having nothing to relieve them, she had been to drown her∣self, but was mercifully prevented; and said, she was coming to my Room to in∣form me of it. I gave her some immediate Relief, and desired her to meet me at the Prison with her Husband in the Afternoon. She came, and GOD there apprehended them both by his <HI>Free Grace.</HI> She was powerfully quicken'd from above: And when I had done Reading, her Husband came to me, like the Trembling Jaylor, and Grasping me hard, cried out, <HI>I am upon the Brink of Hell.</HI> From this Time forward both of them grew in <HI>Grace.</HI> GOD by his Providence soon delivered him from his Confinement: Tho' before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Offenders against GOD and one another <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> now they became Helps <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> other in the great Work of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

Salvation. They are both now living, and I trust, will be my Joy and Crown of Rejoicing in the Day of our LORD JESUS.</P>
<P>Soon after this, the Holy Season of <HI>Lent</HI> came on, which our Friends always kept very strictly, Eating no Flesh during the Six Weeks, except on <HI>Saturdays</HI> and <HI>Sun∣days;</HI> I abstained frequently on <HI>Saturdays</HI> also, Eating nothing on that and other Days, except <HI>Sundays,</HI> but coarse Bread and Sage Tea without Sugar. I constant∣ly walk'd out in the cold Mornings till part of one of my Hands was quite black. <HI>This,</HI> with my continued Abstinence and outward Conflicts, at length, so emaciated my inward Man, that at <HI>Passion Week,</HI> finding I could scarce creep up Stairs, I was obliged to inform my kind Tutor of my Condition, who immediately sent for a Physician to me.</P>
<P><HI>This</HI> caused no small Triumph among the Collegians, who began to cry out, <HI>What is his Fasting come to now?</HI> But I re∣joiced in this Reproach, knowing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> tho' I had been imprudent and left much of my Flesh, yet I had increased proportion∣ably in the Spirit.</P>
<P><HI>This</HI> Fit of Sickness continued upon me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> above seven Weeks, and a glorious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.

<PB N="40" REF="004626_0044_100D887D457C4C00"/>
was purifying my Soul. All my <HI>gross,</HI> and even my <HI>Heart</HI> Sins, were brought to my Remembrance, which I put down immediately, and confessed them before GOD Morning and Evening. Tho' weak, I often spent two Hours in my Evening Retirements, and Prayer over my <HI>Greek</HI> Testament, and Bishop <HI>Hall'</HI>s most excel∣lent Contemplations, every Day that my Health would permit. About the End of seven Weeks, and after I had been Groan∣ing under an unspeakable Load both of Body and Soul for above a Twelvemonth, GOD was pleased to set me free in the following Manner: One Day perceiving an uncommon Drought and a noisome Clamminess in my Mouth, and using Things to allay my Thirst, but in vain; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was suggested to me, that when JESUS CHRIST cried out <HI>I Thirst,</HI> his Sufferings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> over. Upon this, I threw <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, the Bed, crying out, <HI>I Thirst, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>:</HI> Soon after I perceived my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> off, a Spirit of Mourning was taken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me, and I knew what it was truly to <HI>rejoice in the LORD.</HI> At first, after that, I could not avoid Singing Psalms wher∣ever I was; but my Joy gradually <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more settled, and, blessed be GOD, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> abode and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> in my Soul (saving <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> few casual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>) ever since.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="004626_0045_100D888283001100"/>
Thus were the Days of my Mourning ended. After a long Night of Desertion and Temptation, the Star which I had seen at Distance before, began to appear again, and the Day-Star arose in my Heart. Now did GOD take full Possession of my Soul; and, as I humbly hope, sealed me to the Day of Redemption.</P>

<P>Before I returned from <HI>Gloucester</HI> to <HI>Oxford,</HI> I spent three Weeks at <HI>Bristol,</HI> where I went to see some Relations; but could not do them much good, because of the Prejudices they had imbibed against me.

<P>About this Time GOD was pleased to enlighten and bring me into the Know∣ledge of the <HI>Freeness</HI> of <HI>his Grace,</HI> and the Necessity of being <HI>justified,</HI> in his Sight, by <HI>FAITH alone.</HI> This was more extraordi∣nary, because our Friends at <HI>Oxon</HI> run in∣to the <HI>Mystick Scheme:</HI> And one of them (a dear Servant of our LORD) lately con∣fessed he did not like me so well at my last coming to <HI>Oxford,</HI> as the rest of his Bre∣thren, because I held <HI>Justification by Faith:</HI> And yet he observed I had more Success. But, blessed be GOD, most of us now have been taught <HI>this Doctrine</HI> of GOD, and, I hope, shall be willing to die in the Defence of it. It is the good old <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> of the <HI>Church of England.</HI> It is what the <HI>Holy Martyrs</HI> in Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Time sealed with their Blood, and which, I pray GOD, if need be, that I and my Brethren, may seal with Ours.</P>
<P><HI>Burkit'</HI>s and <HI>Henry'</HI>s Impositions were of admirable use to lead me into <HI>this</HI> and all other evangelical Truths. Many Months have I kneeled to study and pray over those Books, as tho' I had been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at my Master's Feet. The Holy Spirit from time to time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> into the knowledge

of Divine Things; and I have been di∣rected, by Watching, and Reading the Scriptures in this Manner, even in the minutest Circumstances, as plainly as the <HI>Jews</HI> were, who consulted the <HI>Urim</HI> and <HI>Thummim</HI> at the High Priest's Breast.</P>
<P><HI>Allen's Alarm, Baxter's Call to the Un∣converted,</HI> and <HI>Janeway's Life,</HI> when I read them at leisure Hours, were much blessed to me. I bless GOD, the Partition Wall of <HI>Bigotry</HI> and <HI>Sectarianism</HI> was soon broken down out of my Heart. As soon as the <HI>Love</HI> of <HI>GOD</HI> was shed abroad in my Soul, I loved all, of whatever Deno∣mination, that loved the LORD JESUS in Sincerity.</P>
<P>During my Stay here, GOD enabled me to give a publick Testimony of my Re∣pentance for Seeing and Acting Plays. Hearing the Strolers were coming to Town, and knowing what an egregious Offender I had been, I wrestled with GOD in Prayer to put me in a Way to manifest my <HI>Abhorrence</HI> of my former ill Conduct. In Answer to this. I was stirred up to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mr. LAW'S excellent little Treasure, entituled, <HI>The absolute Unlawfulness of the Stage Entertainment.</HI> GOD gave me <HI>Favour</HI> in the Printer's Sight: At my Re∣quest he put a little of it in the News for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Weeks successively; and <HI>GOD</HI> was pleased to give it his Blessing.</P>

Having been absent for six Months from the <HI>University,</HI> I thought it time to think of moving thither; but before I came to a Resolution, was convinced that the Hour for returning thither was not as yet come.</P>
<P>At my first coming to <HI>Gloucester,</HI> being used to visit the Prisoners at <HI>Oxford,</HI> I prayed most earnestly that GOD would open a Door for me to visit the Prisoners here also. Quickly after, I dream'd, <HI>That one of the Prisoners came to be instructed by me.</HI> The Dream was impressed much up∣on my Heart. In the Morning I went to the Door of the County Goal; I knocked, No-body came to open it; I thought the Hour was not yet come: I waited still upon GOD in Prayer; and in some Months came a Letter from a Friend at <HI>Oxford,</HI> desiring me to go to one <HI>Pebworth,</HI> who had broken out of <HI>Oxford</HI> Goal, and was retaken at <HI>Gloucester.</HI> As soon as I had read this Letter, it was suggested to me, that my Prayer was now answered. Im∣mediately I went to the Prison, assuredly gathering that the LORD called me thi∣ther. I met with the Person, and finding him and some others willing to hear the Word of <HI>GOD</HI> (having gained leave of the Keeper and two Ordinaries) I constant∣ly read to and prayed with them every Day I was in Town; I also begged Money for

them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> general, relieved one or two in particular, ordered Provisions weekly to be distributed amongst them, and put such Books into their Hands as I judged most proper. I cannot say any one of the Prisoners was effectually wrought upon: However, much evil was prevented, many were convinced, and my own Soul much edifyed and strengthned in the Love of GOD and Man.</P>
<P>Thus employed, I continued in my own City for three Months longer; de∣spised indeed by many, but highly blessed and favoured by GOD. My Under∣standing was enlightened, my Will broke, and my Affections more and more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with a Zeal for CHRIST. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> believe, were added to my Society, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shall be saved.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">My Preparations for HOLY ORDERS.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the Time I first enter'd at the <HI>University,</HI> especially from the Time I knew what was <HI>true</HI> and <HI>undefiled</HI> Religi∣on, I entertained high Thoughts of the Importance of the ministerial Office; and was not solicitous what Place should be prepared for me but how I should, prepare myself for a Place.</P>
<P>That Saying of the Apostle, <HI>Not a</HI> No∣vice, <HI>lest, being puffed up with</HI> Pride, <HI>he fall into the Condemnation of the Devil;</HI> And that first Question of our excellent Ordination-Office, <HI>Do you trust that you are</HI> inwardly <HI>moved by the</HI> HOLY GHOST <HI>to take upon you this Office and Administra∣tion,</HI> used to make me tremble, whenever I thought of entring into the <HI>Ministry.</HI> The Shyness that <HI>Moses</HI> and some other <HI>Prophets</HI> expressed, when GOD sent them out to act in a publick Capacity, I tho't <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sufficient Examples for me to learn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not to <HI>run</HI> before I was <HI>called.</HI> GOD knows my Heart, I never prayed more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> against any Sin, than I did a∣gainst entring into the Service of the
<PB N="52" REF="004626_0056_100D88A028DF1AB0"/>
Church so soon. Oftentimes have I been in an Agony in Prayer, when under Con∣victions of my Insufficiency for so great a Work. With strong Crying and Tears, in the Language of <HI>Moses,</HI> I have cried out, <HI>LORD, I am a Youth of uncircumcised Lips; LORD, send me not out into thy Vine∣yard yet.</HI> And sometimes I had Reason to think, GOD was angry with me for resisting his Will. However, I resolved to pray against it as long as I could. If GOD did not grant my Request in keep∣ing me out, I knew his Grace would be sufficient to support and strengthen me, whenever he sent me into the Ministry.</P>
<P>To my Prayers I added my Endea∣vours; and wrote Letters to my Friends at <HI>Oxford,</HI> beseeching them to pray to GOD to disappoint the Designs of my Country Friends, who were for my taking Orders as soon as possible. Their Answer was, <HI>Pray we the LORD of the Harvest, to send</HI> THEE, <HI>and many more</HI> such <HI>La∣bourers, into his Harvest.</HI></P>
<P>Another old and worthy Minister of JESUS, when I wrote to him about the Meaning of the Word <HI>Novice,</HI> answer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> it meant a <HI>Novice</HI> in <HI>Grace</HI> and not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Years; and he was pleased to add, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Paul <HI>was at</HI> Gloucester, <HI>he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> Paul <HI>would ordain me.</HI> All <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>

satisfy me. I still continued instant in Prayer against going into <HI>HOLY OR∣DERS,</HI> and was not thoroughly con∣vinced it was the <HI>divine Will,</HI> till GOD, by his good Providence, brought me ac∣quainted with the present Bishop of <HI>Glou∣cester.</HI></P>
<P>Before I conversed with his Lordship, GOD was pleased to give me previous Notice of it. One Night, before I had the least Prospect of being called before the Bishop, I dreamt, <HI>I was talking with him in his Palace, and that he gave me some Gold, which chinked in my Hands.</HI> Almost every Day after, this Dream would come into my Mind. Whenever I saw the Bishop at Church, a strong Persuasion would arise in my Mind, that I should very shortly go to him. I always checked it, and prayed to GOD to preserve <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from over desiring that Honour which cometh of Man. One Afternoon it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that the Bishop took a solitary Walk, as I was told afterwards, to Lady <HI>Selwyn'</HI>s, near <HI>Gloucester,</HI> who, not long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> had made me a Present of a Piec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Gold. She, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, recommended <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Bishop. A few Days after, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> from the Cathedral Prayers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of no such Thing, one of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and said, the Bi∣shop

desired to speak with me, I, for∣getful, at that time, of my Dream, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> turned back, considering with∣in myself what I had done to deserve his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Displeasure. When I came to the Top of the Palace Stairs, the Bishop <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> me by the Hand, told me <HI>He was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> and begg'd me to wait a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> put off his Habit, and he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> me again.

At his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Bishop told me, he had heard of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Character, liked my Behaviour at Church; and after I told him my Age, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> says he, I have declared <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Three and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> He then made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to buy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in my Hand, put me in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my Heart with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of God's Love.</P>

to tell them, how the Bishop, of his own Accord, had offer'd to give me <HI>HO∣LY ORDERS</HI> whenever I would. They (knowing how I had depended on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> His Lordship <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> made some Time ago, that he would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> under <HI>Twenty-three</HI>) said, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I then began to think so myself, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> held out any longer, I should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> GOD. At length I came to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> on, by GOD's Leave, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> myself for <HI>HOLY ORDERS</HI> the next <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Days.</P>

But when I came to Oxford, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> urged several Reasons for my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> at the University, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> not long been gone abroad, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> take Care of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> further urged, that God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Endeavours <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>

known to me, some of them sent to that <HI>great</HI> and <HI>good</HI> Man, the late Sir <HI>John Phillips,</HI> who was a great Encourager of the <HI>Oxford Methodists;</HI> and tho' he had never seen, but only heard of me, yet he sent Word, he would allow me <HI>Thirty Pounds</HI> per Annum, if I would continue at the <HI>University.</HI> Upon this, finding the Care of the Prisoners would be no more than, under GOD, I could manage with Pleasure; and knowing the <HI>University</HI> was the best Place to prosecute my Studies, I resolved, GOD willing, to let <HI>Oxford</HI> have the First-Fruits of my ministerial Labours.</P>
<P>In the mean while (having before made some Observations upon the <HI>Thirty-nine Articles,</HI> and proved them by Scripture) I strictly examined myself by the Qualifica∣tions required for a Minister, in <HI>Paul's</HI> Epistle to <HI>Timothy;</HI> and also every Ques∣tion that I knew was to be publickly asked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at the Time of my <HI>Ordination.</HI> This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I drew out at large in Writing, and sealed my Approbation of it every <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y</HI> at the <HI>blessed Sacrament.</HI> At length <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sunday</HI> being near at Hand, and having my Testimonial from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, I went a Fortnight before-hand to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> intending to compose some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and to give myself up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to Prayer.

are not as our Thoughts. When I came to <HI>Gloucester,</HI> notwithstanding I strove and prayed for several Days, and had Matter enough in my Heart, yet I was so restrained, that I could not compose any Thing at all. I mentioned my Case to one <HI>Clergyman;</HI> he said, <HI>I was an En∣thusiast.</HI> I wrote to another, who was experienced in the <HI>divine Life;</HI> he gave me some Reasons why GOD might deal with me in that Manner, and withal promised me his Prayers. I joined with him in importunate Supplication, to know whe∣ther this Restraint was of GOD or the Devil. At last, reading Mr. <HI>Henry</HI> upon the Acts of the Apostles, this Passage was much pressed upon my Heart, <HI>We assay'd to go into</HI> Bythynia, <HI>but the Spirit suffer'd us not.</HI> Looking a little farther, I found a Quotation out of <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> wherein GOD said to that young Prophet, just after he had given him a divine and publick Com∣mission, <HI>Thou shalt be dumb, but when I speak unto thee, then shalt thou speak.</HI> This made me quite easy. The Remainder of the Fortnight I spent in reading the se∣veral Missions of the <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Apos∣tl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>;</HI> and wrestled with GOD to give me <HI>Grace</HI> to follow their good Examples.</P>
<P>About Three Days before Ordination, the Bishop came to Town; the Evening
<PB N="58" REF="004626_0062_100D88B192C51978"/>
after, I sent his Lordship an Abstract of my private Examination upon these two Questions, <HI>Do you trust that you are in∣wardly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oved by the</HI> HOLY GHOST <HI>is take upon you this Office and Ministration? Are you called according to the Will of our LORD JESUS CHRIST and the Laws of this Realm?</HI></P>
<P>The next Morning I waited on the Bi∣shop in Person. He received me with all <HI>Love;</HI> told me, <HI>He was glad I was come that he was satisfied with the Pre∣paration, I had made, and with the Allow∣ance given me by Sir</HI> John Philips. <HI>I had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> self,</HI> said he, <HI>made Provision for you of two little Parishes; but since you chuse to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Oxford, <HI>I am very well pleased, I doubt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but you will do much good.</HI> Upon this, I took my leave, wondring at GOD's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> towards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Wretch, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> delighted, that in every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, he had made my Way into the Ministry so very plain before my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I think was on Friday. The Day following I continued to spend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. In the Evening I retired to a Hill near the Town, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pray'd most fervently for about two Hours, in Behalf of myself and those who were to be ordained with me.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="004626_0063_100D85DC5E5B9370"/>
On Sunday Morning I rose early, and prayed over St. <HI>Paul'</HI>s Epistle to <HI>Timothy,</HI> particularly that Precept, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no one despise thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> When I went up to the Altar, I could think of Nothing but <HI>Samuel</HI> standing before the LORD with a linnen Ephod. When the Bishop laid his Hands upon my Head, my Heart was melted down, and I offer'd up my whole Spirit, Soul and Body to the Service of GOD's Sanctuary. I read the Gospel, at the Bi∣shop's Command, with <HI>Power;</HI> and af∣terwards sealed the good Confession I had made before many Witnesses, with CHRIST's most blessed Body.</P>
<P>Being restrained, as was before observed, I could not, tho' sollicited thereto, preach in the Afternoon; but I read Prayers to the poor Prisoners, being willing to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the first Act of my ministerial Office be an Act of <HI>Charity.</HI></P>
<P>The next Morning, waiting upon GOD in Prayer, to know what he would have me to do, these Words, <HI>Speak out Paul,</HI> came with great Power upon my Heart. Immediately my Heart was enlarged: GOD spake to me by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Spirit; I was no longer dumb; I finished a Sermon I had in Hand some time before; I began ano∣ther, and preached, the Sunday following, to a very crowded Audience, with as much
<PB N="60" REF="004626_0064_100D88B7D842F3E8"/>
Freedom as tho' I had been a Preacher for some Years.</P>
<P>Oh the unspeakable Benefit of Reading to the Poor, and exercising our Talents while Students at the University! Such previous Acts create excellent Habits, and make young Ministers not aukward, but apt to teach. It is remarkable our LORD sent out his Apostles on short Missions, before they were so solemnly authorized at the Day of <HI>Pentecost.</HI> Would Tutors of our Universities follow his Example, and send out their Pupils to visit the Sick and the Prisoners, to pray with, and read practical Books of Piety to the Poor, they would find such Exercises of more Service to their Pupils and the Church of GOD, than all their private and publick Lectures put together.</P>
<P>But to come to a Conclusion. Thus GOD dealt with my Soul: And at the same Time he was not forgetful of my Body; for he inclined the Bishop's Heart to give me <HI>Five</HI> Guineas more; and by this Time; Quarter's Allowance way due to me from Sir <HI>John Philips,</HI> b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> which Sum put together, served <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> well to defray the Expences of my <HI>Ordination,</HI> and taking my <HI>Batchelor's De∣gree,</HI> which was conferr'd upon me at <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣ford</HI> the Week after my being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

<P>These Changes from a <HI>Servitor</HI> to a <HI>Batchelor of Arts,</HI> from a common <HI>Draw∣er</HI> to a <HI>Clergyman,</HI> were great Temptati∣ons to think more highly of myself than I ought to think. Some were jealous over me, as I trust they always will be, with a godly Jealousy. Hereby GOD, who is rich in Mercy, forwarned me of my Dan∣ger, stirred up my Heart to pray against spiritual Pride, and kept me, as I hope he will unto the End, in some Measure hum∣ble.</P>
<P>Thus did GOD, through a Variety of unforeseen Acts of <HI>Providence</HI> and <HI>Grace,</HI> train me up for, and at length introduced me into the Service of his Church. What has happened to me since that Time, espe∣cially for these two last Years past, is too notorious to need a Repetition. However, as I find Freedom in myself, and Leisure from my ministerial Employ, hereafter (GOD willing) I shall relate some Dealings of GOD with my Soul, and how he led me (without any Foresight of my own) into my present Way of Acting.</P>
<P>In the mean while, <HI>My dear Reader,</HI> whoever thou art, I pray GOD what I have now written may not prove a Savour of <HI>Death unto Death,</HI> but a Savour of <HI>Life</HI>

If thou art as yet unspotted from the World, I pray <HI>GOD</HI> to keep thee so: For, believe me, Innocence is better than Repentance; And tho' Sin may afford thee some bruti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> present Pleasure, ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Remembrance of it afterwards is exceeding bitter. If thou art immersed in Sin, as I was, take no En∣couragement from me to continue in it on one Hand, nor despair of Mercy on the other: Let <HI>GOD'</HI>s Goodness to me lead thee to Repentance. The same LORD is rich unto all that call upon him through <HI>Faith</HI> in CHRIST JESUS. And if through <HI>Grace</HI> I have done any Thing Praise-worthy, not unto me, not unto me, but unto GOD give all the Glory. If thou art awakened to a Sense of the <HI>Divine Life,</HI> and art <HI>Hungering</HI> and <HI>Thirsting</HI> after the <HI>Righteous∣ness</HI> of JESUS CHRIST, and the <HI>Indwelling of his blessed Spirit</HI> in thy Heart, think it not absolutely necessary to undergo all the Temptations that have befallen me. It is in the <HI>spiritual</HI> as it is in the <HI>natural Birth.</HI> Some feel more, others less; but all must experience some Pangs and Travails of Soul ere CHRIST JESUS be formed within them.
