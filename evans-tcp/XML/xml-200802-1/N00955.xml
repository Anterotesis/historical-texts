<P>THE Life of man, both as man, and as Christian, is a continual Warfare. Changes and War are against him. Formida∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Armies of Opposition are daily be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>guering all those who (like the <HI>Isra∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> of God of old) are Marching out of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Spiritual <HI>Egypt</HI> of Sin, through the
<PB N="2" REF="001145_0003_0FB08E35532AAD60"/>
Wilderness of a tempting and Ensnar∣ing World, unto, the heavenly Canaan. And as <HI>Israel</HI> went harnassed out of <HI>E∣gypt,</HI> so is it the duty and interest of Christians to be at all times well ap∣pointed; and in a Warlike posture, that so they may be able to fight their way through the Hellish Troops, and Infer∣nal Regiments which endeavour to beat them off from, and hinder them in all those holy and resolute attempts they are making to secure to themselves, through the Assistance of Grace, an open en∣trance and passage in<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Glories of the better Country. There is a good fight of Faith which every Christian must fight, or he will never lay hold on that Eternal Life unto which he is called. And as there are many things which if seriously pondered by Christi∣ans, will serve to animate them unto, and make them circumspect in their Christian Warfare, so there are two especially which I may not omit the mention of.</P>
<P N="1">1. They have a Compleat armour of Proof provided for them, which duely put on, and skilfully managed; will in∣dubitably render them impregnable,
<PB N="3" REF="001145_0004_0FB08E376346AF78"/>
and secure to them signal and assured Victories over all their Enemies.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Enemies they are to engage and combate with are not only strong and powerful; but marvellously poli∣tick, subtil &amp; crafty, excellently skil'd, and wonderfully improv'd in the Art of War.</P>
<P>Both these Considerations are in the Words of our Text very pertinently re∣commended to our notice, by the great Apostle of the <HI>Gentiles;</HI> and an affectio∣nate exhortation to the patting on of the former, is grounded upon the latter, as a reason of very great and unde∣niable Cogency.</P>
<P>In the Words then we may observe two things:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>An Exhortation.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>The Ground or Reason of it.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>An Exhortation: Put on the whole armour of God.</HI> And in this there are three things to be considered.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The subject matter which the Exhorta∣tion has a respect unto, the</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. the Panoply, or whole Armour of God. Two things are implyed here.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That the Armour, the Spiritual Com∣batant is to be furnished with, is not of his
<PB N="4" REF="001145_0005_0FB08E3A29FCDEF0"/>
own providing</HI>: No, It is the <HI>Armour of God.</HI> Kings have their Royal Arsenals, where all their Stores of War are care∣fully preserved, from hence their Ar∣mies are supplyed with Weapons of all sorts, and put into a Warlike Equipage fit for the field. The King of Kings and Lord of Lords hath his royal Arse∣nal also, from hence Christians receive all that royal furniture which is neces∣sary to equip them for, and Arm them to the Spiritual Warfare.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That the Armour, the Spiritual Com∣batant is to put on is not carnal, but Spiri∣tual:</HI> The <HI>Graces</HI> of Gods Spirit, are the <HI>Armour</HI> here intended. The Apostle Expresses himself in <HI>Military terms,</HI> and cloaths his exhortation in a <HI>Souldier-like garbe.</HI> The expression is Metaphorical, Here's an excellent allusion to the seve∣ral sorts of War-like Weapons, and Ar∣mour, which Souldiers are furnisht with when they go out to War. This Metaphor the Apostle more largely insists upon in the Subsequent context, where he runs the Analogy, and discovers the particu∣lar use and serviceableness of the Graces of Gods Spirit, from the respect they bear unto the several pieces and parts
<PB N="5" REF="001145_0006_0FB08E3EDD55E728"/>
of proper armour there mentioned.</P>
<P N="2">2. We may consider <HI>the Act which the Spiritual Combatant is advised to, or that which the Spiritual Souldier is to do with this armour: He must put it on.</HI> The Apostle here alludes to the Custome of Souldiers, making ready to engage their enemies. They repair to their Arms, buckle on their armour, not omitting any one piece of it, which may serve either to defend themselves, or annoy their ene∣mies. They think it not enough to put on their head-piece, and neglect their breast-plates, Shields and Swords; No, they will be Armed Cap-a-pee from Head to Foot. It is not enough that the Souldier is well provided with ar∣mour; He must have it on, and be in a readiness for the battel. Thus Christi∣ans must get themselves furnished with Grace, all the Graces of Gods Spirit, &amp; live in the constant exercise and im∣provement of them. They must be compleatly Armed to the Combat, with the whole Spiritual Armour, no piece of it must be wanting, lest being in any part naked, and void of suitable defence, they become unable to make good their ground against the formidable insults of their hellish adversaries.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="6" REF="001145_0007_0FB08E41EEBA8640"/>3. We may consider <HI>the Subject Persons concern'd in the exhortation. All true Christi∣ans, All Orders, Ranks and Degrees of Christi∣ans, in all Ages and Generations.</HI> Altho' the <HI>Ephesians</HI> to whom the Epistle is in∣scribed were firstly concerned in it, yet all Christians are secondarily concern∣ed. The Apostolical Epistles were ne∣ver designed to be of private, but com∣mon concernment. To put on the whole armour of God is the duty of all Christians, whatever Station they hold, or Relation they sustain. This parti∣cular is excellently illustrated from the special quality those are treated in who are the Subjects of the duty here pro∣pounded. The Spirit of God treats them in the quality of Souldiers, or of Persons ingaged in a Warfare. The Word of Command in our Text is per∣fectly Military, <HI>Put on the whole Armour of God.</HI> It is as if the Apostle had said, Remember Christians, that in a Spiritual sence you are Souldiers, and therefore see to it, that you be compleat in Arms and Ammunition; see to it, that you stand furnished with the whole of the glorious Armour, God hath provided you with, that you may be able to en∣counter
<PB N="7" REF="001145_0008_0FB08E4388AC8908"/>
with, hew your way through and put your Enemies to a rout, and confusion.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Reason or Ground of the Exhorta∣tion;</HI> the reason why Christians should thus Arm themselves with, or put on the whole armour of God, viz. <HI>That they may be able to stand against the wiles of the De∣vil.</HI> And here we have three things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The grand Enemy of the Spiritual Com∣batant detected, the Devil: That ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the Devil.</HI> The Devil is the true Christians prin∣cipal Enemy. The Apostle expresses himself here in the singular number, &amp; that with a peculiar emphasis; but yet by an usual Synecdoche, he intends all those vast, and (as to us) numberless <HI>Troops</HI> of evil spirits, who are under the conduct of the Prince of the Powers of the Air: And thus he explains himself in the 12<HI>th.</HI> verse. The <HI>General</HI> (as is frequent) is here put for the whole <HI>Ar∣my</HI> under his conduct. There may be a farther notion in the expression. God would hereby let us know, that the Powers of Darkness are strongly leagued, and banded together; and do all joyn as one in prosecuting the designs of Hell
<PB N="8" REF="001145_0009_0FB08E44E2925780"/>
against the Children of God. And whilst Christians reflect upon the vast, and hideous numbers of Devils, who are with a united force continually engage∣ing them, how necessary is the Spiritual Armour to defend them against their wiles! How proper is that exclamation of the Psalmist, <HI>Lord, how many are they that rise up against me! Psal.</HI> 3.1.</P>
<P N="2">2. We have <HI>the way the Devil takes in managing his War with the Spiritual Com∣batant discovered.</HI> His War is managed with <HI>Wiles, Policies</HI> and <HI>Stratagems.</HI> He observes a <HI>Method</HI> in fighting: Thus in our Text. <HI>That ye may be able to stand against</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. i. e. <HI>The Methods of the Devil.</HI> A method is the artificial or orderly disposition of the several parts of a matter or subject treat∣ed upon. And because a good judg∣ment and contrivance are necessary to dispose our thoughts, and meditations upon whatsoever subject into an order∣ly consistence, or agreeable frame; therefore the Subtilties, Policies and Stratagems improv'd by Satan in con∣triving, fore-laying, and managing his desperate designs against the Children of God, are stiled his <HI>Methods.</HI> Satan's
<PB N="9" REF="001145_0010_0FB08E4C6C244EE8"/>
greatest strength lies in the crafty wiles, and politick stratagems he makes use of; and by his extraordinary dexterity in finding out, and performing his hell∣ish stratagems, we are in greatest haz∣zard to be ensnared, and circumvented by him.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>We have the great Serviceableness of the Spiritual Armour demonstrated.</HI> By putting on and managing of this aright, the <HI>Spiritual Combatant</HI> shall be able to <HI>Stand,</HI> that is, he shall not only make good his ground, but obtain a signal assured, and compleat Victory over all his Spiritual enemies. The Devil by many crafty artifices, and cunning stra∣tagems seeks to decoy Christians into the toils he hath secretly disposed on purpose to ensnare and trapan them: But let them put on this armour of God, and resist him stedfastly in the Faith, he shall flee from them, they shall stand, and be Victorious over him.</P>
<P>Many useful and profitable Doctrines might be offered from the Words: I shall present you with one not altoge∣ther unsuitable to, or improper for the present Occasion. From the Words then, this is the</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<PB N="10" REF="001145_0011_0FB08E4DF0F91C00"/>
<HEAD><HI>DOCTRINE.</HI> That God in his Word, doth treat Christians in the quality of Souldiers; Or as Persons engaged in a Warfare.</HEAD>
<P>The true Christian is the Person con∣cerned in the exhortation proposed in our Text; and his being treated in the quality of a Souldier, is that which re∣commends the Word of Command to him with a more graceful and becom∣ing properness. The Spirit of God in addressing Christians, doth make use of a Military stile, and cloaths his expres∣sions in a Souldier-like Dialect: And his doing so sufficiently discovers to us the quality he treats them in.</P>
<P>In speaking further unto this Doctrine I shall give you,</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>The Demonstration of it, by an in∣duction of various Instances.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>The Reasons of it.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>Conclude with a few suitable Counsels, or Directions.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">1. For the Demonstration of the Doctrine, these Subsequent considerati∣ons will put it past dispute.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="11" REF="001145_0012_0FB08E4F63A96CD0"/>1. <HI>The Church Militant is compared to an Army.</HI> Of the Church Militant it is said; <HI>Thou art beautiful O my Love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an Army with Banners,</HI> Cant. 6.4. The whole Body of the Spiritual Souldiery is stiled an <HI>Host, Dan.</HI> 8.10. <HI>And it wax∣ed great</HI> (i. e. Antiochus Epiphanes, the little horn mentioned <HI>v.</HI> 9<HI>th.) even to the host of Heaven, and it cast down some of the Host.</HI> We have the Spiritual Ar∣my introduced as taking the Field, Beat∣ing a challenge to her Enemies; and managing her self with an heroick reso∣lution, after a combat. The Psalmist gives us a marvellous entertaining sight of this Army, taking the <HI>Field</HI> with a Martial Bravery, Marching to the deadly conflict, with Ensigns Flying, and the loftiest expression of a noble courage, and unconquerable Resolution; enough to strike an intimidating damp into the hearts of her Enemies, <HI>Psal.</HI> 20.5. <HI>We will rejoyce in thy Salvation, in the Name of our God we will set up our Banners.</HI> Nor is it a less pleasing prospect, the Pro∣phet gives us, when he introduceth this Army terrible with Banners, with a stately Gallantry, Beating a challenge
<PB N="12" REF="001145_0013_0FB08E50E2A0EDE0"/>
to her Enemies, and sounding forth the amazing Triumphs, &amp; terrifying Shouts of a daring Faith in such lofty Expres∣sions as these; <HI>Associate your selves, O ye People, and ye shall be broken in pieces, and give ear all ye of far Countries: Gird your selves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; Gird your selves, &amp; ye shall be broken in pieces. Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought, speak the word and it shall not stand; for God is with us,</HI> Isa. 8.9, 10. Her Enemies indeed are sometimes represented as pressing hard upon her, and as gaining no small advantage against her; but yet we are told, this will not sink her into a Cowardly dejection, nor dispossess her of a divine fortitude; No, she remains undaunted still, and is confident not∣withstanding to win the Field. Let us hear some of her triumphant shouts of her unshaken confidence uttered upon such an occasion: <HI>Rejoyce not against me O my Enemy: when I fall I shall arise, when I sit in darkness</HI> (She speaks like a Priso∣ner of War) <HI>the Lord shall be a light unto me. I will bear the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute Judgment for me. He will bring me forth to the light</HI> (as a Captive out of the dark Dungeon)
<PB N="13" REF="001145_0014_0FB08E594781F770"/>
<HI>and I shall behold his righteousness. Then she that is mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her which said unto me, where is the Lord thy God; mine eyes shall behold her; now shall she be trodden down as mire in the street,</HI> Mich. 7.8, 9, 10. And because the Church Militant is represented as acting in all points like an Army, the Spirit of God hath influenced particular Saints, who are a part of, and help to compose this Army, to observe the de∣corum, and to speak of themselves and fellow Saints, as of men at Arms. The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> represents himself as an expert Commander, exercising his Souldiers in their several postures, and teaching them by his own example to handle their Arms, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.26. <HI>So fight I.</HI> thus and so I manage the Spiritual Weapons, and so must you if you would be Victorious. It is in the quality of a Souldier, he treats his <HI>Timothy,</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 6.12.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Church Militant is represented as having most puissant and mighty Comman∣ders.</HI> God himself disdains not to be styled and accounted their General. He wears the Title of the Lord of Hosts, The God of the Armies of <HI>Israel.</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="001145_0015_0FB08E5AAA4D7BA8"/>
17.45. It is worthy observation, that those titles, The Lord of Hosts, The God of Hosts, The Lord God of Hosts, are more than an hundred times put upon him in the Scripture. And al∣though it must be acknowledged, that he is so styled, because all Creatures are subject to his power, and stand rea∣dy prest as Souldiers under the Com∣mand of a General, to execute his will and pleasure: yet it cannot be denied, but that God hath assumed this title in a peculiar manner with respect to his Church and People, as an argument to encourage them unto resolution and hope of victory in all their Conflicts with their Enemies, considering them∣selves to be Listed under the Command and Conduct of an All-wise, and Al∣mighty Commander. The Lord Jesus Christ hath Military Titles put upon him: He is the Prince of that Host whereof God is Commander. <HI>Dan.</HI> 8.11. He is Captain of the Lords Hosts. <HI>Josh.</HI> 5.14, 15. He is Captain of Salvation to Believers, <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.10. The Spirit of God represents him as standing at the Head of his glorious Troops, fighting with, and actually engaging the old Dragon
<PB N="15" REF="001145_0016_0FB08E5C27D599F0"/>
and his Angels. <HI>Rev.</HI> 12.7. He is intro∣duced as Sitting upon his white Horse making War in Righteousness, having Eyes like a flame of fire, his Vesture dip't in Blood, a sharp Sword issuing out of his mouth, and all the Armies of Heaven following him, submitting to his Conduct; acknowledging him to be their Glorious Leader. <HI>Rev.</HI> 19.11. <HI>ad.</HI> 16.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Holy Angels are Appointed by God for the defence and protection of his Children; and sustain the quality of the Confederate Allies of the Church Militant; They are styled an Host,</HI> Luk. 2.13. <HI>And suddenly there was with the Angel, a mul∣titude of the Heavenly Host.</HI> The Servi∣ces the Holy Angels perform for the Saints of God, whilst managing their Spiritual Warfare, are very great, and they are expressed in the language of the Camp. <HI>Psal.</HI> 34.11. <HI>The Angel of the Lord</HI> (the singular number for the plu∣ral) <HI>encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivers them.</HI> It was a glori∣ous appearance the Angels made unto <HI>Jacob,</HI> when afraid of his Brother <HI>Esau</HI>; But behold the form they appear in, was that of two potent Armies, <HI>Flank∣ing</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="001145_0017_0FB08E5DCF929A50"/>
him on each <HI>Wing,</HI> to assure him that God would take care of him, and secure him from all the dangers he sup∣posed himself exposed to. <HI>Gen.</HI> 32.1, 2. When the Army of <HI>Syrians</HI> had com∣passed about the City <HI>Dothan</HI> with a design to surprize the Prophet <HI>Elisha,</HI> the invisible Troops, and Guards of Hea∣ven surround him; and the form they are represented in is that of a formida∣ble Army: 2 King. 6.17. <HI>And behold the Mountain was full of Horses, and Chariots of fire, round about Elisha.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The Church Militant, &amp; all the Mem∣bers of it, are represented to us as strongly fortified and entrenched.</HI> They are said to have a strong Tower of safety to re∣pair unto in a time of need. <HI>Prov.</HI> 18.10. <HI>The name of the Lord is a strong Tow∣er, the righteous runneth into it and is safe.</HI> They have a place of refuge to betake themselves unto when the Battel grows too strong for them. <HI>Deut.</HI> 33.27. <HI>The Eternal God is thy refuge.</HI> Concerning Gods <HI>Jerusalem</HI> it is said, <HI>God is known in her palaces for a refuge. Psal.</HI> 48.3. They have an hiding place to repair unto, and secure themselves in, when chased and pursued by their Enemies. Thus
<PB N="17" REF="001145_0018_0FB08E6033FD7A90"/>
the Psalmist expresseth himself, <HI>Thou art my hiding place, thou shalt preserve me from trouble.</HI> Psal. 32.7. <HI>David</HI> makes his boast of this, Psal. 27.5. <HI>In the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the se∣cret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; He shall set me upon a Rock, and now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me.</HI> And hence it is the Children of God are called hidden ones. Psal. 83.3. <HI>They have taken crafty counsel against thy People, and consulted against thy hidden ones.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>They have weapons of war provided for them, by the help of which they may ma∣nage their Warfare to good advantage.</HI> Each Grace of the Spirit is represented by a several piece of Armour; Sincerity is the Christians Belt, or Military Girdle, Righteousness his Breast-plate, Faith his Shield, Hope his Helmet; The Word of God his Sword, far exceeding the Sword of <HI>Goliah,</HI> there is none like it. <HI>Eph.</HI> 6.14, 16, 17. The Censures of the Church regularly administred, are <HI>weapons migh∣ty through God, to the pulling down of strong holds.</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.4.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Many of the commands and directions given to Christians, are delivered in a Mar∣tial
<PB N="18" REF="001145_0019_0FB08E62A84A4908"/>
Dialect.</HI> Are Souldiers commanded to <HI>Stand</HI> to their <HI>Arms</HI>? So are Christi∣ans; It is the Apostles language, <HI>Foras∣much then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm your selves likewise with the same mind.</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 4.1. Are Souldiers com∣manded to observe an exact Order in their March, to Even their Ranks, and Streighten their Files? So are Christians. Phil. 3.16. <HI>Nevertheless whereunto we have already attained, let us walk by the same Rule.</HI> Criticks observe the Origi∣nal word here translated <HI>Walk,</HI> to be a Military word, importing such an or∣derly, regular, and graceful walking as Souldiers observe in their <HI>Marches,</HI> and <HI>Exercises.</HI> Is it expected that Souldiers should <HI>Watch</HI> and <HI>Ward,</HI> lest they be sur∣prized by their Enemies at unawares? So is it of Christians; 'Tis the Com∣mand of their Glorious Leader, <HI>Watch ye,</HI> 1 Cor. 16.13. This word of Command is of universal concernment. <HI>Mark</HI> 13.37. <HI>I say unto all Watch.</HI> Are Souldiers told, they must endure hardness? So are Christians; Let us hear the advice, 2 Tim. 2 3. <HI>Thou, therefore endure hardness as a good Souldier of Jesus Christ.</HI> Are Souldiers commanded to follow their
<PB N="19" REF="001145_0020_0FB08E69785AF8B0"/>
Leaders? So are Christians; 'Tis the Command of their Glorious Captain, <HI>If any man will be my Disciple, let him take up his Cross and Follow me.</HI> Are Soul∣diers addressing themselves to the Com∣bat, encouraged to behave themselves couragiously, to fight with an undaun∣ted resolution, rather to dye on the Spot than to give ground, or to lose the Bat∣tel? So are Christians; It is the Apo∣stles Exhortation, <HI>Quit ye like men, be strong.</HI> 1 Cor. 16.13. <HI>Fight the good fight of Faith, lay hold on Eternal Life,</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 6.12.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>They are heartned to the Combat with the encouraging assurances of protection, as∣sistance, victory and glorious rewards; And all this in the language of the Camp.</HI> Do their Enemies at any time appear so strong &amp; powerful as to surprize them with fear, and cause them to dread the Combat; they are encouraged to stand their ground, from a sence of the <HI>Di∣vine protection.</HI> Psal. 91.4. <HI>He shall cover thee with his Feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust, his truth shall be thy shield and Buckler.</HI> They have the Assurance of Divine Assistance. <HI>Isa.</HI> 41.10. <HI>Fear thou not for I am with thee, be not dismay∣ed,
<PB N="20" REF="001145_0021_0FB08E6AC660B0C0"/>
for I am thy God; I will Strengthen thee, yea I will help thee, yea I will uphold thee, with the right-hand of my righteous∣ness.</HI> However it may fall in some particular <HI>Skirmishes,</HI> yet the Victory at last shall go on their side. The Apo∣stle speaks of, and triumphs in this as a ruled case. 1 Cor. 15.57. <HI>Thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> Whatever oppo∣sitions lye in their way, they are assu∣red to win the Field, and to be more than Conquerors. Rom. 8.35, 37. <HI>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? Nay in all these things we are more than conquerours through him that loved us.</HI> And although it may cost them many a sore conflict, and terrible shock to manage their Conflicts unto victory, yet the toils and labours, watchings and fight∣ings they undergo, shall at last be well rewarded; And with a prospect, and promise of this they are encouraged to maintain the fight. Rev. 2.10. <HI>Fear none of these things which thou shalt suffer: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a Crown of life.</HI> Rev. 3.21. <HI>To him

that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my Throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his Throne.</HI></P>
<P>This may suffice for the Demonstra∣tion of the Doctrine. The Reasons of it follow. I shall take notice but of Two.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>God treats Christians in his Word, in the quality of Souldiers, that he may instruct them more fully, in those things he would inform them about.</HI> The Information of men is one great end the Scripture scopes at. It is in this respect, the <HI>Commandment is a lamp, and the Law a light. Prov.</HI> 6.23. Men are very dull, and slow of understanding in things of a spiritual nature; and therefore God is pleased to call in the help of apt simi∣litudes, and curious metaphorical allu∣sions to assist their understandings in the pursuit of Duty. These have a singular aptitude to convey the know∣ledge of truth more fully to our Un∣derstandings, and to set them before us in a clearer light. It is a gracious effect of the Infinite Condescendency of God, that he attempers his phrase to our Capacities and Apprehensions;
<PB N="22" REF="001145_0023_0FB08E6E9ADD1728"/>
and illustrates Spiritual Truths to us, by similitudes and allusions, that are plain, and obvious to us. God him∣self puts us in mind of the favour he does us in this respect. Hos. 12.10. <HI>I have multiplied Visions, and used Simili∣tudes by the Ministry of the Prophets.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>God in his Word treats Christians in the Quality of Souldiers, as a means to fa∣sten Instructions more powerfully upon them.</HI> Scripture Allusions and Similitudes have a double advantage to effect this.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They exceedingly delight men, and en∣gage their affections, and so make the deeper impressions upon their Memories.</HI> That which the Psalmist affirms concerning the Word and Law of God in general, is true concerning the metaphorical al∣lusions contained in it. <HI>They are sweet∣er than the Honey and the Honey-comb.</HI> Psal. 19.10. The Souls of men are sur∣prizingly transported with ravishing delight, whilst they are digging and delving after the precious <HI>Oar</HI> of Di∣vine Instructions, that lye hid in the rich and inexhaustible <HI>Mines</HI> of Scrip∣ture Allusions; and the deep impres∣sions upon their engaged affections,
<PB N="23" REF="001145_0024_0FB08E750A213748"/>
give advantage to their being more faithfully secured, and treasured up in their Memories. The more men love and admire any thing, the better they remember it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Objects the Spirit of God makes use of as a Stock to graff Spiritual Instructi∣ons on, are for the most part in our daily view; and by the sight of them we are as∣sisted unto a fresh remembrance of, and fruit∣ful reflections upon those instructions they readily afford us.</HI> We cannot look either upward or downward, on our right hand, or left, but some object or other comes in view which God hath set a∣part to do the office of a Monitor, or faithful remembrancer, to assist our re∣flections on Spiritual things. To for∣bear the mention of other Instances; The very sight of a <HI>Souldier in Arms</HI> is enough to <HI>Muster</HI> up an intire <HI>Regiment</HI> of holy thoughts, and profitable medi∣tations in the Soul of a Christian. If he looks upon the dazling brightness of his glittering armour, behold! here is a monitor to put him in mind of the out-shining Splendour of those glorious Robes of Righteousness, which every Saint is Arrayed with. Each piece of
<PB N="24" REF="001145_0025_0FB08E789B94D638"/>
his Armour represents to him a several Grace of Gods Holy Spirit. Whilst he seeth with what a stately grandeur he Marcheth after his Leader, disdaining to cast an eye upon the little trifling diver∣sions that lye in his way; will not this tell him that he must be a follower of the Lamb whithersoever he goes? That he must press toward the mark, for the prize of the high calling in Christ Jesus? Doth he observe the remarkable Silence of the Souldier, whilst he awaits the Orders of his Commander, and will not this engage him to entertain the Psal∣mists resolution, <HI>I will hear what God the Lord will speak,</HI> Psal. 85.8. Will not this dispose him to take notice of the wise mans advice, Eccl. 5.1. <HI>Be more ready to hear than to offer the Sacrifice of fools.</HI> But I forbear to insist further on this Head, and pass to the <HI>Application.</HI></P>
<P>The short time allotted for this Dis∣course will not allow me an Opportu∣nity to <HI>Charge through</HI> the vast Field of Meditations this Doctrine has laid open before us▪ I shall therefore briefly Se∣lect some few of those many <HI>Coun∣cels</HI> or <HI>Directions</HI> I might offer to

<P><HI>Yield Constant Obedience then to the Com∣mands, &amp; Directions of your Great &amp; Glori∣ous Commander.</HI> To be Subject to Com∣mand is the Duty and Glory of a Souldi∣er. The Law of the Camp enjoyns the Souldier to be perfectly at the Com∣mand of his General. He must obey, and not dispute the Command of his Officers, and go at their bidding, tho' it be upon the Mouth of the roaring Canon. He must not decline the great∣est Perils and Dangers, if Commanded to encounter them: Nothing must be attempted by the Souldier without par∣ticular Order; he neither advances, nor retires without direction. Souldie∣ry therefore is well defined to be, <HI>Obe∣dientia quaedam fortis, et invicti animi ar∣bitrio carente suo: The Obediences of a stout and resolute person, out of his own dispose.</HI> The Spiritual Souldier must be a man of the same Character; He must be a∣ble to say with the Psalmist, <HI>I have en∣clined my Heart to perform thy Statutes al∣way,</HI>

Psal. 119.12. God's treating of Christians in the Quality of Souldiers tells them, what a just and reasonable thing it is, they should pay an univer∣sal deference to the holy and righteous Commands of the Lord of Hosts. O∣bedience to the Commands and Di∣rections of Heaven, is both the <HI>Proper∣ty,</HI> and the <HI>Glory</HI> of the Spiritual Souldi∣er. And disobedience to any of them, doth not only reflect a dishonour upon those who have <HI>Listed</HI> themselves under the Glorious <HI>Banner</HI> of the Captain of Salvation; but will (without Repen∣tance) assuredly issue in the utter De∣struction of those who are guilty of it. <HI>Saul's</HI> disobedience to Gods Com∣mand cost him his Kingdom, and Life also. Thus we read, 1 Chron. 10.13. <HI>So Saul died for his Transgression against the word of the Lord.</HI> Was it Motive e∣nough to <HI>Absoloms</HI> Servants, to kill <HI>Am∣non,</HI> that their Master had said, <HI>When I say unto you Smite Amnon, then kill him;</HI> Will you not?

<P><HI>This Doctrine assures Christians that a Noble Courage, and Fortitude of Soul should animate them unto an undountedness of Re∣solution in their Spiritual Warfare, what∣ever Oppositions, Dangers, or Deaths may lye in their way of Duty.</HI> A Souldier must be able to look dangers and diffi∣culties in the face. He must rather chuse an Honourable and Glorious Death, than be willing to Save his Life by an Ignominious &amp; Cowardly flight. Such was the Invincible courage of our <HI>Richard</HI> the First, that he acquired the Sirname of <HI>Coeur-de-Lion,</HI> or Lyon's-Heart. And it is no small part of the true Christians commendation, that he is as bold as a Lyon, <HI>Prov.</HI> 28.1. <HI>The Righteous are bold as a Lyon.</HI> How well does it become those, who are under the Conduct of him, that is the Lyon of the Tribe of <HI>Judah,</HI> to be bold as a Lyon!

as to be frighted from a pursuit of Duty, by the most menacing threats, and vigorous Oppositions of his boldest Adversaries. It is one of the Commands the Spiritual Souldiery is entertained with, <HI>In nothing be terrified by your Adver∣saries, Phil.</HI> 1.28. There is nothing the Spiritual Combatant can reflect upon, but it hath a Tendency to encrease his Courage and Resolution. If he look to his Cause, is it possible to engage in a better? He is unworthy the Name of a Christian, that will not say with <HI>Luther, Mallem ruere cum Christo, quam regnare cum Caesare.</HI> I had rather perish with Christ than reign with <HI>Caesar.</HI> Or with the glorious Martyr, If all the hairs of my head were men, they should all suffer in the cause of Christ. Is not his Call clear? Are not the rewards proposed for his encouragement great? Must he not either fight or dye? Is it possible to come off upon other terms? are there not more for him than against him? cannot God Save by few as well as many? Is he not well provided for the Battel? and shall not Victory a∣wait his Valour? Have not his fellow-Souldiers ennobled themselves by their

Heroick Atchievements, and led him along in the path of eternal Honour and Renown? The three Children Scorned the Insulting and terrible threats of an Inraged Monarch; <HI>Paul</HI> accounted not his Life dear to him; <HI>Chrisostome</HI> when menaced by the Em∣press <HI>Eudoxia,</HI> feared nothing but Sin. <HI>Luther</HI> when Summoned by the Empe∣rour <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth to give an account of his Faith, notwithstanding all dis∣couragements, fearlesly resolves to go to <HI>Wormes</HI> though there were as many Devils there as Tyles on the Houses. What shall I more say? For the time would fail me to relate the notable in∣stances of the Saints Resolution in all Ages! Let us look off then unto Jesus; our Glorious Captain hath left us an Unparallel'd instance of matchless reso∣lution. The cross he endured, the Shame of it, he despised, and having conquered, and triumpht over all the powers of hell and darkness, sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God, and from the lofty Battelments of Hea∣ven looks down upon and Commands the Spiritual Combatants, to consider him that endured such contradiction of

What tho' they encounter death, and seem to fall, the bloody victims of the wrath and rage of their accursed enemies, will not Heaven and Happiness pay for all? Is it not a truth beyond ex∣ception, <HI>If we suffer, we shall also reign with him,</HI> 2 Tim. 2.12.</P>

and support of it. The Spiritu∣al Souldier should be a man of like temper, whilst he considers the Quality he is treated in; it should quicken him to an accuracy of critical circumspect∣ion in all his Conversation; And teach him a compliance with that Apostoli∣cal Advice, <HI>Only let your Conversation be, as it becometh the Gospel of Christ, Phil.</HI> 1.27. The Wise man has told him, <HI>A Good name is better than precious ointment,</HI> Eccl. 7.1. <HI>David,</HI> that Martial Heroe was of this opinion, and therefore put his Life and Honour into the same Scale. Psal. 7.5. <HI>Let the Enemy persecute my soul and take it, yea, let him tread down my life upon the Earth, and lay my Honour in the Dust.</HI> His Honour you see brings up the <HI>Rear</HI> in this gradation, as <HI>Jacob</HI> ranked <HI>Rachel</HI> and <HI>Joseph,</HI> to testify his greater regards to them. How very careful then should Christians be, that they do not expose their own Honour, or the Reputation of Religion, by a careless, uncircumspect, unagreeable Life and Conversation?

Whilst the true Spiritual Souldier reflects on such things as these, Rivers of tears will run down his Eyes, and with a generous resentment, he'll command his Soul, (in the words of dying <HI>Ja∣cob) O my Soul come not thou into their Secrets, unto their Assembly, mine honour, be not thou united,</HI> Gen. 49.6. The con∣sideration of this, will powerfully dis∣pose him to be more serious, holy, careful and circumspect in his whole Conversation; for this he knows shall <HI>exalt his born in honour,</HI> this will <HI>give to his Head an ornament of grace, and compass him about with a crown of Glory,</HI> Prov. 4.9.</P>

<P><HI>Stand upon your Guard, and be alwayes upon your Watch.</HI> Watching and Ward∣ing are Services, that Souldiers are constantly put upon. The neglect of this would be of destructive conse∣quence to an Army. A culpable re∣missness in point of holy Watchfulness, puts many an opportunity into the hands of our Spiritual Adversaries to do us a mischief. The great Reason why Christians do so frequently fall into temptation, is because they are not so watchful over, and do not set so strict a <HI>Guard</HI> upon themselves as they ought. Our Glorious Comman∣der knew very well by what means temptations might be best <HI>warded</HI> off. It is his Command therefore, <HI>Watch and Pray that ye enter not into temptation.</HI> Mat. 26.41. It is his charge, <HI>Be watch∣ful, Rev.</HI> 3.2. Had <HI>David</HI> been upon his Watch, he had never fallen into those horrible sins of Adultery and Murder. Careful Watching is an ex∣cellent help unto a sure standing. Hence the Advice runs thus, <HI>Watch ye,
<PB N="34" REF="001145_0035_0FB08E96ABFAD1D0"/>
stand fast in the truth.</HI> 1 Cor. 16.13. Two things amongst many others may serve to put an edge upon this Dire∣ction.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Remember Christian, Thou art in thine Enemies Countrey.</HI> The Soul∣dier has need of watching at all times, but more especially when he is in his Enemies Country, environed on all sides with mortal foes who watch all opportunities of setting upon him, and doing him a mischief. Christian, Art thou not in thine Enemies Country, surrounded with innumerable Troops of subtil and malicious Adversaries, who are watching opportunities to ru∣in, and destroy thee? And will not this quicken thee to watchfulness? Shake off then all carnal Security, en∣trench thy self strongly, double thy Guards, and keep out wakeful Espials, lest at unawares thou givest advantage to him who goeth about like a roaring Lyon, seeking whom he may devour.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Thine Enemies</HI> (Christian) <HI>are not Tyro's and Novices in the School of War;
<PB N="35" REF="001145_0036_0FB08E9FDA112050"/>
No, they are old, cunning and veterane Commanders, perfectly acquainted with all the crafty devices, and politick stratagems of War.</HI> And hereby they have great advantage over incautelous, and fool∣hardy Sinners, who are therefore said to be taken Captive by Satan at his will. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.26. Such are with ease trepan'd and decoy'd into his ensnaring ambushments; should not this then in∣fluence Christians to care and watch∣fulness in their Christian Warfare, and awaken them to stand alway up∣on their Guard? <HI>The Simple</HI> indeed <HI>pass on and are punished, but</HI> as for <HI>the prudent he foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself, Prov.</HI> 22.3. But when all is said and done, our own watchfulness will not serve the Turn, we must call in the assistance of Grace, and shrowd our selves under the protection of him, who is the keeper of <HI>Israel,</HI> assuredly knowing that security from, and vi∣ctory over the cunning Artifices of Hell, are designed to be, the peculiar Triumphs of sovereign and free Grace. The consideration of this should doubt∣less sway our hearts unto earnestness

of prayer for divine protection, and dispose them unto such thankful ac∣knowledgments as we find the Church enlarging her self upon. Psal. 124.6, 7, 8. <HI>Blessed be the Lord, who hath not gi∣ven us as a prey to their teeth; Our Soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the flowlers; the snare is broken, and we are escaped.

<P N="1">1. <HI>An unwearied study of Gods Word.</HI> This is the Magizine of all Spiritual Instruction. The Souldier hath his Books to instruct him how to manage

his Weapons well, and so hath the Spiritual Souldier.

<P N="2">2. <HI>A dayly practice and exercise of the Spiritual Armour.</HI> Use makes perfect. It is the Souldiers daily practice of Arms that makes him expert in the use of them.

always carrieth his Life in his Hand; and there is many times but a step be∣tween him and death. His Enemies are always dogging him at the heels, seeking an opportunity to surprize and destroy him. God would hereby awa∣ken Christians to <HI>see,</HI> that so they might be <HI>sensible</HI> of the <HI>dangers</HI> they lye open to in their <HI>March</HI> unto Glory. The Souldiers danger hears a proportion to the numbers and strength of his Ene∣mies. And thus the Case stands with the Spiritual Souldier: He may ex∣claim with <HI>David, How are they encrea∣sed that trouble me</HI>! Psal. 3.1. <HI>Consider mine enemies for they are many, and they hate me with an hatred of violence.</HI> Psal. 25.19. Numberless <HI>Troops</HI> of infernal Spirits are perpetually making their <HI>Batteries</HI> against him. The <HI>World</HI> with all its ensnaring vanities, charming al∣lurements, and cruel oppositions, en∣creaseth the number of his sworn Ad∣versaries. He has a <HI>Corrupt Heart,</HI> a <HI>Body</HI> of <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Death</HI> to wage War with. The consideration of this alone made the great Apostle in a distressing agony to cry out with a bitter cry,

<HI>O wretched man that I am, who shall deli∣ver me from the body of this death!</HI> Rom. 7.24. And that which aggravates the danger is, that his Internal Foes are in league with, and are upon every oc∣casion ready to betray him into the hands of his external Adversaries. His outward sences make head against him, are Traitors to him, and conspire his destruction. The Sentinels posted at the <HI>Cinque Ports</HI> of his Soul which should carefully spy and give notice of danger, are either overcome with a culpable slumber, or open their <HI>Win∣dows</HI> to let in sinful objects. His <HI>Ears</HI> set open their <HI>Door</HI> to the bitterest ene∣mies of his Soul. His Smelling, Touch and Taste, are up in rebellion against him; by Intelligence with these, his Adversaries are advantaged in every Attack they make upon him, and how is it possible (amidst so many dangers) he should escape unless God in a way of Sovereign Grace strengthen him with strength in his Soul; and make him strong in the power of his might.</P>

<P>God has put great Advantages who are in places of Command in the Spi∣ritual Army, (that is Civil and Religi∣ous Rulers) of doing great Service for him in their Generations. It should be their Care to pursue those Advanta∣ges to the uttermost. As for those who are persons of such a Figure amongst our selves, I shall take the Liberty of saying, That <HI>New-England</HI> never yet saw the Time wherein those at the <HI>Helm</HI> of Civil or Sacred Rule, had greater Reason to bestir, and Quit themselves like men. Do not Sins of all sorts abound? Are not provocati∣ons multiplied in the midst of us? Have not Astonishing Inundations of Profaneness, Sensuality, and Debau∣chery, broken in upon us?

Rom. 12.18. <HI>If it be pos∣sible, as much as lieth in you, live peacea∣bly with all men.</HI> The Contentions of those who are in places of Command in the Spiritual Army (the Civil Ru∣lers, and Sacred Guides of a People) will have a ruining aspect upon every thing wherein the best Interests of a People are concerned. No good Suc∣cess will ever attend the Counsels of those who should with one Heart, and Shoulder prosecute all Affairs of com∣mon Concernment. Where a spirit of Division hath rendred them Jealous of, suspected by, and disaffected to each other. The Case of a People must needs be sad, when a perverse Spirit is mingled amongst those who are the Stay of the Tribes of it. What lost the <HI>English</HI> acquisitions in <HI>France</HI> but by the unhappy Variances of those who bare chief Command over the Victori∣ous Armies designed to maintain them?

The <HI>Chinks</HI> and <HI>Chaps</HI> in a Council board may do more disservice to an Ar∣my, and more terribly boade its destru∣ction, than an Army of an Hundred Thousand men. Let not any think that this Article of Advice, can be too pressingly enforced upon us, or that we are but little concerned in it. Doubt∣less we have had our <HI>Massah's,</HI> and our <HI>Meribahs (O tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon.)</HI> And if no other inconveniencies have derived to us from hence but this only, that many persons who in more respects than one, have deserved well at our hands, have met with undue and▪ undeserved treatments from us, (from whence hath arisen too much contempt and wrath) it will sug∣gest to us an argument sufficient to dis¦pose us▪ unto a being peaceable in our <HI>Israel;</HI> and to prepare us unto a ready Compliance with the Apostolical Counsel, <HI>Let all bitterness and wrath, and Anger, and Clamour, and evil spea∣king be put away from you, with all ma∣lice. And be ye kind one to another, tender hearted, forgiving one another, e∣ven as God for Christ's sake hath forgi∣ven you,</HI> Eph. 4.31, 32.</P>

Hereby the Spirits of Christians are ruffled with unsanctified Passions, their Charity one toward another miserably enfeebled; unrea∣sonable Suspicions fomented, Unwar∣rantable <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> encreased: their Pride <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, their Communion with Heaven shamefully obstructed; their Souls put into such intollerable Paroxysms, and Fermentations, as do many times throw Families, Towns, and Churches, into terrible Convulsions, and miserable Confusions. And how melodious are the interlacings of such discords amongst Christians to the In∣fernal Spirits? This fills the Territories of Hell and Darkness with Mirth and Triumphs, and these doubtless are some of the Shouts they make upon it, Aha! so would we have it. Will not these things influence us to dread the fatal Consequences of Division and Dis∣cord? The Apostle has told us what may be expected from it, <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.15.

Dost thou at any time say with him, <HI>I shall one day perish by the hand of Saul</HI>? Here's an Effectual Cordial to revive thy droop∣ing, and fainting Soul. The Almigh∣ty himself calls to thee, <HI>Fear not, for I am with thee; be not dismayed, for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee, yea I will help thee, yea I will uphold thee with the right hand of my Righteousness,</HI> Isa. 41.10. He assures thee, that it is <HI>He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might, He encreaseth strength.</HI> And withal has promised, That <HI>they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength: They shall mount up with Wings as Eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint,</HI> Isa. 40.29, 31.

The Souldier is disengaged from all care about such things, and is wholly main∣tain'd at the Charge of those that em∣ploy him. This may assure the Spiri∣tual Souldier, that God will take care of, and make sufficient Provision for him, whilst he continues in the Field of War. Nothing shall be lacking to him, that is necessary for him in his Warfaring State and Condition; he shall want no good thing, <HI>Psal.</HI> 34.9, 10.

Satan and the World, yea, and Death it self the last Enemy shall prove an happy Pedestal from whence thou shalt mount up into thy Chariot of Tri∣umph, in which the Glorious Guards, and Convoys of Heaven shall trans∣port thee through the Conquered Territories, and broken Troops of thy vanquished Foes, into the Mansions of Eternal Glory; where the Crowns of Righteousness shall be put upon thy Head, and Garlands of Eternal Ho∣nour Wreath thy Brows: And now to thy Eternal Joy thou shalt experience, that the light Afflictions thou didst grapple with whilst managing thy Warfare in a Sinful and Troublesome World, have wrought out for thee a far more Excee∣ding and Eter∣nal Weight of Glo∣ry.</P>
