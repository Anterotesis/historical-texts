<HEAD>The Preface.</HEAD>
<P>IT is above Sixty years since Courts of Ju∣dicature have been Erected in the Town of <HI>Ipswich;</HI> yet was it never known in all that time any person Arraigned there for any Capital Offence. Which might justly be supposed to be the reason that so ma∣ny Thousands were there gathered, as was scarcely ever heard of or seen upon any occa∣sion in any part of <HI>New England.</HI> Which could not but put all serious and thoughtful Spirits in mind of the Great and General Assembly that will appear at the Great Day to receive their final Sentence: Which Mul∣titude were gathered to behold the Tragical End of the person then Executed, which was attended with so many signals of Divine Grace and Favour, as the following pages will give a more perfect and distinct Account of, which not to have published, would have been a concealing of the Displays of the De∣clarative Praise and Glory of God; and a damp to the Encouragement of Paenitent Sin∣ners to hope for Mercy at the last hour. These following Subjects that were handled on those
<PB REF="001020_0004_0FAEE8865AE7E0E0"/>
Lecture Weeks when the Criminal was Tryed, Condemned, and afterwards Executed, appea∣ring to be very suitable to the Occasion. And the Discourses which were raised from them being judged worthy of publication; not only to revive the memory of those that were hap∣py in hearing of them; but that all others, who may providentially come to the view of them, may be stirred up to praise the Lord for his wonderful goodness, in making such an heinous Sinner such an Instance of Converting Grace and Mercy: Neither shall any need to question the truth of the repentance of the person Condemned, &amp; after Executed, from the shortness of the time of her Experiences: The Thief that Commenced Converted on the Cross (as was expressed by him that Preach∣ed on that occasion) is a proof of the possibili∣ty hereof; <HI>for with God all things are possible:</HI> Seeing we read not any thing of his Conversion before he was Nailed thereon, but God (whose gifts of Grace &amp; Mercy are free, and disposes of them, to whom, and at what time he pleases, did bless the publick and pri∣vate means that were used, so as to bring about this marvellous Change in this poor Creature, for the Exalting of the Riches of his Grace to miserable Sinners. So as that
<PB REF="001020_0005_0FAEE88783407D30"/>
she may be counted worthy to be added to those several memorable Instances of special Mercy recorded in Ancient History, viz. that of Sir <HI>Jervace Ellowis, Jacobus Andreas,</HI> and others, which Mr. <HI>Clarks</HI> History recites in the Life of the Reverend Mr. <HI>William Perkins.</HI> So as that upon consideration of this late &amp; former Examples of like nature all that hear thereof <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay well break forth in the words of the Apostle, Rom. <HI>11.33 O the riches both of the wisdom &amp; knowledge of God how unsearchable are his Ways, &amp; his Judgments past finding out.</HI></P>
<P>Further also, It is not unworthy to be in∣serted, That this poor Creature lately Execu∣ted, when she took her last leave of her Chri∣stian Friend, (the night before her Execution) as she sti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed him blessed by whose Ministry she had received most benefit &amp; Comfort.

<HEAD>TO THE Christian READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE Word of the Lord is in it self always precious, yet best esteemed where and when there are few or no open Vi∣sions; therefore it is said when <HI>Samuel</HI> began to Prophesy, <HI>the word of the Lord was precious in those days,</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 3 1. For when there is a Famine of hearing the Word, <HI>then will men wander from Sea to Sea, and run to and fro, to seek the word of the Lord: and the fair Virgins and Young men will faint for thirst, Amos</HI> 8.12, 13. It is the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s wonderful, but not the less Sinful, that good Books &amp; good Sermons, are so little valued in our Age: for the full Soul is wont to loath the hony comb. And <HI>Israel</HI> it self despised the Corn of Heaven, when it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell about their Tents every day: yet through the mer∣cy of God things are n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t come to that
<PB REF="001020_0007_0FAEE888B43EC568"/>
woful pass in <HI>New England,</HI> but that good Sermons and good Books find many good Friends. And we have the less reason to fear, the following Discourses will want <HI>Readers,</HI> nay we cannot but hope for a general acceptance, conside∣ring the weightiness of the Subject, the worthiness of the Author, and the awful∣ness of the Occasion of their Preaching and Printing.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The weightiness of the Subject on which the Sermons treats.</HI> It is no less then <HI>LIFE</HI> and <HI>DEATH</HI> is to be set before you: which when <HI>Moses</HI> set before <HI>Israel, he call'd Heaven and Earth to Record, Deut.</HI> 30.19. Sirs, What is more bitter then the <HI>Death</HI> that Sin de∣serves? except the Sin that deserves it: and what is more sweet then the <HI>Life</HI> that God gives through Jesus Christ? except God in Christ who gives it. Besides, both the <HI>Death</HI> and the <HI>Life</HI> treated on are ETERNAL, and they whose minds run on <HI>Eternity,</HI> and the things that are <HI>Eternal,</HI> will not account the time long or lost, that is requisite for the Reading a little <HI>Book</HI> Surely they that choose <HI>Life,</HI> will do more then this
<PB REF="001020_0008_0FAEE88954086330"/>
to escape the Wages of Sin, and to attain the Gift of God: and what more ne∣cessary and proper, than to stir up Youth to cleanse their ways, that so they may escape the threatned <HI>Death,</HI> and obtain the promised <HI>Life</HI>? and this the Reader will find effectually done in the Third Sermon.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Worthiness of the Author, will be no little motive to them that best know him: viz.</HI> The Church and Town of <HI>Ipswich,</HI> where he Exercises his Pastoral Charge and Care, and the Neighbour∣hood round about; and were he as well known in other parts, where this Book may come, we should not have menti∣oned this argument; &amp; his known mo∣desty forbids us however, to say much of it; yet we may not omit saying, that we esteem him to be a pious, painful, Minister of the Gospel; and that God hath Crowned his Ministerial Labours with good success, and hath owned and honoured his Ministry, (as well as that of his Aged, Reverend, and Worthy Colleague, Mr. <HI>William Hubbard</HI>) with the convincing, humbling, comforting, and (a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is generally believed) convert∣ing
<PB REF="001020_0009_0FAEE88B295C9F80"/>
as leud, and rude, and wretched a Sinner, as most that are brought home to God, whose woful circumstances, gave the occasion of the Ensuing Ser∣mons; in Preaching whereof he com∣mended himself to the Consciences of them that heard him; and especially to hers, who for the sake of his frequent visiting her in Prison, and Praying with and for her, and for his Counsils in pri∣vate and in publick, cried out in Prison, <HI>O Blessed Rogers▪ O happy Prison!</HI> but we pass this, being got before we are aware to the third particular, which was the awful oc∣casion of the Sermons. They being Preacht at the Trial, Condemnation &amp; Execution of one <HI>Esther Rodgers,</HI> (who by the way, tho' she was of the same name with the Author, yet was no ways related to him, unless as her Spiritual Father.) This poor woman was the unnatural Mother, and cruel Murtherer of two spurious babes, the fruit of her own Body; a most dread∣ful instance of the Wrath of God a∣gainst the Sin of Fornication &amp; Whore∣dom, which so sadly abounds in our Land, and a Warning to such, as indulge themselves in the breach of the Seventh

Commandment, least thereby they lead themselves into temptation, and so God leave them to break the Sixth; and to work folly &amp; falshood against their own lives, &amp; the lives of their Children, as well as against their own Chasti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y &amp; Honour. One reason why God ordained such dreadful punishment for Sinners in this world was, <HI>That a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l Israel might hear and fear, and do no more so wickedly</HI>: and we judge that the reading of these Sermons, and the Confessions and Penitential Pa∣pers, and Dying Speeches and Prayers of the poor Condemned Woman, may be a means to startle the Rising Genera∣tion, and to keep others from sinning in the same kind, and to make them to beware of the works of Darkness, least God bring them to light, and to punish∣ment at the same time, publishing and punishing in the place of Beholders, what was done in secret. And let it be remem∣bred, that her sin found her out, and that she endured unexpressible horror, before she obtained Consolation; and when she did obtain i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, it must be ascribed to the unaccountable Soveraign Free Grace of God, who to the Eternal Glory of his free

Grace, granted her Repentance unto life, when many others <HI>dy without instruction, and go astray in the greatness of their folly, being taken by their own iniquity, and held with the cords of their own sin,</HI> as is threat∣ned, <HI>Prov.</HI> 25 22, 23. So true is that, <HI>Rom.</HI> 9.18. <HI>The Lord hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hard<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s; i. e</HI> Judicially leaves them to the hard∣ness of their own hearts. The Gracious Lord gives instances of both kinds, that none may presume, and that none may despair, but that all may <HI>work <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut their own Salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who worketh in us both to will &amp; to do of his good pleasure</HI>; Phil. 2.12, 13. <HI>And it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God who sheweth mercy,</HI> Rom. 9.16.</P>
<P>We have nothing further to add, but to desire of the Reader, a just candour toward the Reverend Author, and his holy endeavours; so as not to wring or wrest any particular expression beyond his intention, who had no inclination, much less design to appear in Print, but was averse even to a fault, and very hardly perswaded to suffer it to be done,
<PB REF="001020_0012_0FAEE88F07F1E7B0"/>
perhaps fearing, what was proper enough to profit a well-minded popular Auditory, might not be fully guarded against a cavelling adver∣sary; for his province at that time was that of predicant, and not of a disputant; &amp; his design was, to convince men, that sin was odious, and that God was gracious, and to urge both to the uttermost He dealt with the Consciences and affections of Sinners, to move them to repen∣tance, that God might be Glorified, &amp; Sinners might be Saved. As it had a good effect in Preaching, so we hope and pray that it may in Printing. And if any should think the worthy Author might have been more particular on this occasion, in setting forth the danger and mischief of the Sin of Fornication, for the warning of the Rising Generation. Let the Reader know, that the Reverend Mr. <HI>Hubbard</HI> did purposely and effectually do it in the same Pulpit, from those words, in 1 Cor. 6.9, 10. <HI>Know ye not that the Unrighteous shall not inherit the Kingdom of God? be not deceived, neither Fornicators, nor A∣dulterers, &amp;c.</HI> Which made him more general, which his Text also led him to, for the wages of all and every Sin is death. Now that God may be Glorified, the Reader benefited, and the pious Author further encouraged and succeeded in his Ministerial Labours; is the hearty desire of your Friends and Servants for Christ's Sake.</P>

</LIST>
<P>Quest. 1. <HI>What is Sin?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> In general, 'Tis the swerving or declining of the Nature or Act of the Reasonable Creature from the Will and Law of the Creator: It is the Ha∣bitual or Actual Exorbitancy, or Devi∣ation of the Affections and Actions of man from the Commands of God. God is the last End, the End of all things. As he is <HI>Alpha,</HI> so <HI>Omega,</HI> the First and Last, Beginning and Ending. <HI>Of him and from him are all things,</HI> and also to him; from him as their Origi∣nal, to him as their End. His Will therefore is the Creatures Rule. The Will that is In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eriour, is to be regulated b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Will of the Superiour: The will of the Father is the Rule of the Child: The Command of the Leader is the Rule of his Souldiers: The Supream Will is the Rule of that which is Subor∣dinate. Hence the Will of God Revea∣led is the sole Rule and Law of our Inclinations, Dispositions and Actions. It is the right straight line by which
<PB N="4" REF="001020_0016_0FAEE891A773BF28"/>
our whole course should be ordered. Now any warping or turning from this line is Sin. The Statutes of the Lord are right, the observing them is Righteous∣ness. The Conformity of our Nature, Powers, Faculties and Acts unto the Law of God; For Sin is a Transgression of the Law. 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.4. <HI>Whosoever com∣mitteth sin Transgresseth the Law.</HI> A Con∣cordance of our hearts and ways with the Law of God; This is Righteousness. The Disagreeing of these is sin: If it be the Habitual Deviation of our Na∣ture, 'tis called <HI>Original Sin</HI>: The inordi∣nation of any Act, <HI>Actual Sin.</HI> Neither of these are positive, but only the priva∣tion, defect, absence of Holiness and Righteousness in the heart and ways of men.</P>
<P>Quest. 2. <HI>What is Death?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> As Sin is the privation of Righ∣teousness and Holiness in a Subject whose it ought to be; so Death is the privati∣on of Happiness in a Subject where it might be, or is capable of it: Death is the privation of Life. Now Life being the greatest Natural Good, its put for all Good; and so Death being the pri∣vation
<PB N="5" REF="001020_0017_0FAEE8924BEF6798"/>
of it, and most contrary to it, is the summe and comprehense of all Evil; The loss of all that Happiness and Good both of Soul and Body which man was possessed of here, and was to be commu∣nicated to him afterwards: Likewise the sense of all that Evil which he is the Sub∣ject of, both now and for ever. This is <HI>Death.</HI></P>
<P>Quest. 3. <HI>How this Death is inflicted as a punishment on the Sinner?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Corporally and Spiritually, in both Temporal and Eternal; that is, Inchoatively here, and Consummatively hereafter.</P>
<P N="1">1. Corporally, Man a Sinner suffers Bodily Death in the loss of a twofold Good, and a sence of a twofold Evil, <HI>intra et extra.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) There is the loss or privation of the Internal Good of the Body; as of the Beauty, Strength, Vigour and Activity thereof; in all which Innocent man Excelled: But since the Fall is pu∣nisht with Deformity, Blindness, Lame∣ness, Weakness and Inbecility in all parts, powers and faculties, with an ut∣ter decay of all at Death.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="6" REF="001020_0018_0FAEE89334A43628"/>(2.) The loss of External Good re¦lating to the Body or Outward man, is a fruit and punishment of Sin: There had never been any want of these things, no poverty or indigency, had <HI>Adam</HI> re∣main'd in Innocency. But Sin has de∣prived man, not only of self perfections, but the excellency, suitableness and sub∣jection of the Creatures to him. These in their very natures are become full of infection and deadly poyson by the contagion of mans sin: The World is full of vanity, disorder, and confusion; yea, in a word, Sin has sown that seed of universal Dissolution, which will one day deface with horror and darkness the Beauty of that glorious Frame of Na∣ture, which we now so much admire.</P>
<P>Again, Sinful man suffe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the inchoa∣tions of Bodily Death in the sence of Evil, internal and external.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) Within are all manner of pains, griefs, aches, sickness, sores, wearisom∣ness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2.) The world without is a true <HI>Bochim,</HI> a place of Tears. There is scarce any thing but ministers matter of sorrow and trouble, for all is not only
<PB N="7" REF="001020_0019_0FAEEC1E03C053C0"/>
vanity, <HI>but vexation of Spirit, Eccles.</HI> 2 17. Our very Honey is mixed with Gall, our Roses set with Thorns, our sweetest pleasures attended with much bitterness: What then may we say of those inmix∣ed simple sorrows which we meet with∣al? By reason of sin, and the Rebellion of man against God, all the Creatures are up in Arms against him; they do not only not yield the comfort which otherwise they would, but they fight a∣gainst him, work his sorrow and ruine. The very Heavens, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Stars which seem to promise nothing but light &amp; comfort, they infect his person and good by their malevolent influences and aspects. The Air proves contagious to him, and scat∣ters its plagues throughout the world. The Waters from above pour down up∣on him; the Waters beneath they swal∣low him up; the Earth is continually gaping and opening its mouth, devours the Inhabitants thereof. The Beasts of the Wood are ravenous and venemous; yea further, man suffers from his own kind, for <HI>Homo homini Lupus</HI>; as if man∣kind had not evil enough, enemies e∣nough to conflict with, besides, he be∣comes
<PB N="8" REF="001020_0020_0FAEEC1E91F0C218"/>
an enemy to himself, and with <HI>Cain</HI> falls out with his Brother and kills him. Sin has sown the seeds of Enmi∣ty and Discord in the nature and mind of men one against another, whence Murders and other mischiefs do pro∣ceed; and what the Ruines and Cala∣mities of Wars have been, all Ages may and do sufficiently witness to us; nei∣ther has our own time wanted the ex∣perience of such Sufferings; though we may have wanted the sence of those Sins which procured them, and for that cause are likely to bring them on again. Yet these are but the beginning or in∣choation of Bodily Death. The per∣fection, consummation or accomplish∣ment hereof is in the other world: And it is the total Absence of all good, and sence of all Evil in the Body, when cast into that place of Torment, where is <HI>Weeping, and Wailing, and Gnashing of Teeth</HI>; when every part and member that has been an instrument of Unrigh∣teousness here, shall be pained in the highest degree of misery, and that for ever.</P>
<P>This is the birth of Sin, part of the
<PB N="9" REF="001020_0021_0FAEEC1F53AC4140"/>
wages which man works for, when he works Rebellion against God. Bodily Death begun here, and finished hereaf∣ter. But there is yet more in Death, and that which is worse too, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2.) The Death of the Soul.

The first is ac∣counted the greatest, and that is the loss of the Image of God in the Soul, or defacing and oblitering that Divine Impression once stamped upon it.

and come short of the glory of God.</HI> Then,</P>
<P>The sence of evil in the Soul is spiri∣tual bondage, a subjection to the Powers of darkness, and all deadly enemies of the Soul. Man by Apostasy brought himself into bonds; whence his Anasta∣cy is exemplified by a Redemption from bondage, <HI>Col</HI> 1.13. This is the bondage of the Devil and his instruments: so that man by sin is a Servant of Servants, and a slave to the Devils Servants, the World and Sin. Man is subject to the Temptation of those evils and snares which are in the World through lust, and unto sin as the fruit of that lust; which subjection is not only a consequent but punishment of the first sin.</P>
<P>Then follows, the Terrors of a guilty Conscience, oft conjoyned with Despair: These are the beginnings of a Spiritual Death.</P>
<P>We may next look to the Consumma∣tion of this Death of the Soul</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>In regard of its loss which is infinite</HI>; being the deprivation of an infinite good; the presence and favour of an infinite God. The greatest heavenly enjoyment is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ruition of God, his

favour and fellowship. The chief hap∣piness of the Saints in heaven is this per∣fect beatifick vision, speculation &amp; con∣templation of the glorious Trinity. Now as contraries serve to illustrate each other, by this we see the infinite loss of that Soul which looses God, Heaven and Happiness all at once: that is punisht with everlasting separation from the presence of the Lord. To whom God shall say, <HI>Depart,</HI> Oh dread<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul word! enough to kill any Soul indeed: <HI>Depart from the living God.</HI></P>

<HI>This is the Second Death, Rev.</HI> 21.8.</P>
<P>This may suffice for Explanation of the Doctrine: <HI>How Death is said to be the Wages of Sin</HI>; even all kinds and degrees of Death, Corporal and Spiritual, Tem∣poral and Eternal. For the proof &amp; con∣firmation hereof, that thus it is, and that thus it should be, or that it is both cer∣tain and just. I might lay down some Positive Texts of Scripture, Examples and Reasons.</P>
<P>First, for Scripture proof.</P>
<P>We may look back to the first threat∣ning, wherein God said to <HI>Adam, In the day thou eatest thou shalt surely dy. Gen</HI> 2.17. This included his Posterity, even all mankind, <HI>who sinned in him and f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll with him in his first Transgression.</HI> And as Ori∣ginal Guilt obligeth, so every actual Sin leadeth unto Death, <HI>Jam.</HI> 1.15. <HI>Lust when it hath conceived bringeth forth Sin, Sin when it is finished bringeth forth Death.</HI> This is the Spawn, the fru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t and effect of Sin naturally. <HI>Prov.</HI> 5. <HI>Solomon</HI> speak∣ing of the strange Woman, says, <HI>Her feet go down to Death her steps take hold of Hell</HI>; her way of Sin is deadly, and they are Children of Death that go after her,
<PB N="13" REF="001020_0025_0FAEEC262CEBE4A8"/>
though they know it not, yet it is for their life. This also is given as a reason of that Expostulation, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.21. <HI>What fruit had ye of those things whereof ye are now ashamed, for the end of those things is Death.</HI> Hence, <HI>He that Converteth a sin∣ner, saveth a Soul from Death.</HI> Then the Scripture is full of instances as well as Assertions to prove the deadly effects of Sin. Sin once brought a destructive deluge on the whole World: drew down Fire and Brimstone on <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah</HI> which consumed them; and many other Examples of immediate Death inflicted on particular Persons, for the punishment of their sins.</P>
<P>The next thing is to shew it <HI>just</HI> as well as certain; or give the reasons, in Answer to the fourth Question.</P>
<P>Quest. 4 <HI>Why it should be thus</HI>? Or, <HI>Why is Sin punished with Death</HI>?</P>
<P>Answ. 1. <HI>From the Will and Pleasure of God</HI>; who is the Sovereign Lord and Law-giver, and may set what penalty he will for the Transgression of his Law. Now its the Will of God that Death should be the wages of Sin, or to reward
<PB N="14" REF="001020_0026_0FAEEC26D9EF3C88"/>
Sin with Death. Its Gods pleasure that man should thus suffer for his Sin; and this is a reason above all other reasons: this were sufficient if there were no other. The Supreme and highest Will, the Will of God it is the Creatures Law, and that is the Rule of Righteousness. God is perfectly independent, has none above him, to limit or give him Rule; but his own Will is the Rule, therefore he can∣not err, if he does but please himself: he break<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no rule except he thwarts his own Will, which is impossible. Now this is Gods will to punish Sin with Death, therefore it is just, for he can Will nothing but what is so. He de∣lights in equity, but hates iniquity. Righteousness and Justice in men, its a beam that issues from this Sun of Righ∣teousness, yea its but as it were a shadow of his brightness; yet God takes delight therein because its a resemblance of that infinite Goodness which is in himself. Justice is essential to him, its his very Being, his Nature and Delight, therefore it must needs be a righteous Sentence that ever proceeds out of his mouth.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="001020_0027_0FAEEC279734C008"/>Reason 2 <HI>Its just also by Gods Cove∣nant and Engagement with man at first.</HI> It was their bargain that Death should be the wages of Sin, <HI>Gen</HI> 2.16, 17. Now consider <HI>Adam</HI> as able to keep this charge, had power to stand, and could not but know the consequents of his Fall: God did not hide his danger from him, as he justly might, but annexes the penalty to the Precept for his warning, [<HI>Thou shalt surely Dy.</HI>] Now if <HI>Adam</HI> would venture his life for a lust, it is no other than just with God to punish the neglect of his Duty and Happiness with the evil he had threatned: if he would choose Death rather than life, God might let him have his choice: and if this was just with respect to <HI>Adam,</HI> so it is to all his Posterity, who were then as parts of him, and in his loines were partakers in the sin, and so justly sha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers in the suffe∣ring: besides the same Law is given us on like penalty, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18 20. <HI>The soul that sins shall dy.</HI></P>
<P>Reason 3. <HI>From a proportion between the Reward of Obedience and Disobedience.</HI> This will appear just: The Reward of Disobedience is not longer or larger in
<PB N="16" REF="001020_0028_0FAEEC28691E5248"/>
point of Evil, than the Reward of O∣bedience should be in point of Good-Man is no more miserable by his Sin, than he should be happy by Righteous∣ness: Life is as great a good, as Death is Evil; Heaven is as large and long as Hell. Now if God would have man to inherit life, Eternal Life as a Reward of his Obedience; then its equal and just, that he should give Death, even Eternal Death as an answerable Recom∣pence of Sin and Disobedience.</P>
<P>Reason 4. <HI>This will appear just, if we consider the Nature of Sin.</HI> That is, <HI>A Forsaking God. Isa.</HI> 1 4. <HI>Jer.</HI> 2▪ 13. There∣fore its just with God to forsake them. God is the Fountain of Life, and all Good, the fountain of living waters; if men will run away from it, <HI>they must needs perish, Psal.</HI> 73 27. It is also just that God should restrain and with hold all the streams of life and comfort, that they never come near them. They that are estranged from the Author of Life by Nature, and yet by actual wil∣ful Departure, set themselves further off from God, how or why should they ever be let to know what belongs to Life Eternal?</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="001020_0029_0FAEEC2919CB16A0"/>Again▪ <HI>Sin is Enmity, and Sinners are Enemies unto God.</HI> As, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.7. <HI>The carnal mind is enmity unto God.</HI> It is high Treason and Rebellion, Treachery a∣gainst the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; what punishment but Death can be just and suitable for Enemies to God, Rebels and Traitors against his Crown and Dignity?

If Death be the Wages of Sin, there could be no life for any man, without the Death and Suffering of Christ who is our Surety.

<PB N="25" REF="001020_0037_0FAEEC32138F2420"/>

Now Sin only is an Enemy to God: How then shall we take pleasure in sin against him, who takes no pleasure in our Death? But love of God and our selves too should make us abhor that which is so displeasing unto him, and destructive to our selves.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Fear of God should deter us from sinning against him.</HI> If we do not for∣sake Sin for love of God as a graci∣ous Father, yet the Fear of God as a terri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le Judge should put a stop to the current of our Iniquity: If the Good∣ness of God which has found out a way of Redemption from Sin will not allure and perswade, let the Justice of God which will inflict Eternal Dam∣nation as the punishment for sin af∣frighten
<PB N="26" REF="001020_0038_0FAEEC32F8AD8968"/>
and enforce us: If the Light of his Countenance, which is better than life, and the joys of Heaven perswade us not; let the dark shadows of Death, and the sorrows of Hell constrain us to this abhorrence of Sin, which can only keep us from the Happiness of the first, and bring us into the misery of the latter.</P>
<P>And here Consider, That the least sin may do us this deadly mischief, (as was before hinted.) The least grain of this Poyson will kill both Body and Soul, if it be not expelled by true and timely Repentance: Therefore if we hate the nature of sin, we should hate the least sins, which are of the same poisonous nature, and mortal effect.</P>
<P>Further to excite, maintain and in∣crease our abhorrence of every sin, let us think more on Death, which is the bitter fruit thereof.

No, He is a God of Justice and without I∣niquity; but it would be injustice to withold a Debt from him to whom it is due: If God be just then, he will pay the Sinner his wages; therefore Death shall be certain, for this is the Reward by agreement: God will be a faithful Pay-master, tho' he does not always pay down, or presently. It is no Unrighte∣ousness to remain for a time in Debt, at least if the Debtor has not bound himself to present payment. But Just∣ice can never utterly forget to pay the Debt it ows.

How impossible will it be for any out of Christ to escape? Can any look, or is there any hopes that we may find more Favour at Gods hands than his only Son? and yet He if he will take upon him the sins of his Elect, must drink of this cup of Death. There is a Second Death, and that is as certain as the first: As sure as there is a Heaven, so sure there is a Hell, a Lake of Fire and Brimstone, and all the wicked of the Earth shall have their portion in it; there is none shall escape, not so much as one.

The Voice of God to <HI>Adam,</HI> it was worse than the roaring of a Lion; yea the dreadful Thunder of Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> it was not half so dreadful as this voice of God in <HI>Eden. Adam</HI> could not bear to see the Lightning after it: therefore he seeks a skreen to hide himself, as not being able to behold the Face of God and live: <HI>Adam</HI> could expect no less than the full Execution of the Sentence of Death which he had subjected himself unto by

his Disobedience. He could expect no other sight of his Maker, than of one armed with Fury and Vengeance to de∣stroy him. God had said, <HI>In the day thou eatest, thou shalt surely d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>; Man has Eaten If then God be a God of Truth, what must his next word be, but a pe∣remptory Sentence of Death against the Offender; or rather the next word might be a blow, the inflicting of that Sentence of Death which was before threatned.

<P>When we read the former part of the Text, with <HI>Adam</HI> we may be ready to flee away from God, from his Presence; we justly dread this voice of God, this word, <HI>THE WAGES OF SIN IS DEATH.</HI> But if we stay a little, and hear further what God the Lord will speak, he speaks <HI>Peace unto the Chil∣dren of men, be turns that Death into Life.

<P>In this Verse the Apostle gives as the summe both of the Law and the Gospel. He is a Son of Thunder, and begins with Terror; it is a dreadful Sentence he praemises; <HI>The Wages of Sin is Death.</HI> He is also a Son of Consolation, and follows with another word as Gracious▪ <HI>The Gift of God is Eternal Life.</HI> Having had occasion and opportunity to insist

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>PROPOSITION I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>That there is Life for Sinners: viz. Life Eternal.</HI> Under which general term is comprehended every good thing: All that is needful or desirable, whatsoever makes to the well being or perfection of a man. Death is the summ and comprehense of all Evil, Life is also the comprehense of all Good. Particu∣larly, the Life here spoken of is Eternal Life, and by it we may understand the Life of Grace and of Glory. These are not distinct in kind, there is only a gra∣dual and circumstantial difference be∣tween them. The truth of the Propo∣sition may be seen both in general and particular. There is Life for Sinners▪ this is the voice of the Gospel. The Law brings news of Death, the Gospel
<PB N="45" REF="001020_0057_0FAEEC46001600D0"/>
brings the glad <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idings of life. The Law concludes all under Death, the Gospel excludes none from Life; stretching forth its Arms to all that will receive it. The Law brings Condemnation, the Gospel Salvation. The Law casts all in∣to Hell, and as <HI>Abraham</HI> said to <HI>Dives, between us and you there is a great Gulph fixed, so that there is no passing from one to the other.</HI> Yet now we may truly say, that this Gulph is passible, or here is a passage from Hell to Heaven. The Gulph is exceeding great, Heaven and Hell are far asunder, Death and Life, there is a vast distance between them; but yet there is a passage <HI>from Death to Life,</HI> 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.14. A Sinner may be brought out of the belly of Hell, as sometimes <HI>Jonah</HI> out of the Whales Belly. Indeed the Law leaves us without hope or help, like <HI>Josephs</HI> Brethren, it casts into the Pit, &amp; does not regard our crying: But the Gospel lets down those Cords by which we may be drawn out thence. The Pit indeed is deep, but there is an Infinite Arm of Grace that can fathom &amp; reach to the bottom of it, and bring us out of it. A Sinners Chains and Fetters may
<PB N="46" REF="001020_0058_0FAEEC4658FD81B8"/>
be broken, and made to fall from him; The Prison doors are set open for man to come out; yea, the door of Heaven is now open, the Gate of Life, wherein whosoever will, may enter, and Live for ever.</P>
<P>Further to illustrate this, Consider two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Life is tendered unto all.</HI> The Gos∣pel is universal in its offers: <HI>Whosoever believeth▪ and is baptized shall be saved</HI>; according to our Saviours Commission to the Preachers of it, <HI>Matt.</HI> 28.19. <HI>Mark</HI> 16.15. Ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, both the Word and the Spirit says, <HI>Whosoever will let him come &amp; take of the waters of Life freely.</HI> Rev. 22.17.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>Life is actually bestowed and conferred upon many, even on all that embrace the Gos∣pel.</HI> There is Grace enough for all in the Gospel, but all will not accept of it. There are those that will not come unto Christ that they might have li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e; <HI>But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the Sons of God</HI>; and Heirs of his Kingdom; Hei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of Life and Glory. So <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Ephesians, You hath he quickned who were dead in trespasses and sins.</HI> Though Death has passed up∣on
<PB N="47" REF="001020_0059_0FAEEC47140CFAF8"/>
all because all have sinned; yet many are already passed from Death to Life.</P>
<P>If any ask, <HI>What Life is</HI>?</P>
<P>They must tarry till they come to Heaven for a full Answer of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his Questi∣on. No man living can here tell what Life is. Angels know it, but can't im∣part the knowledge of it to us.</P>
<P>It is all that Glory, begun in this World and perfected in Heaven, which the Saints shall enjoy to all Eternity. 'Tis the happiness and perfection of the Reasonable Creature in the full enjoy∣ment of God for ever. <HI>There is This Life for Sinners.</HI></P>
<P>Man though a Sinner may yet be uni∣ted to God. Tis most true, that God is a holy God, <HI>and of purer Eyes then to be∣hold iniquity.</HI> He cannot approve Sin, yet he can love the Sinner: He hates Sin with a perfect hatred, infinitely; and yet he loves the Sinner with an infinite love. His heart loaths Sin; he is an E∣nemy to all Sin, and that irreconcileably; yet he can be reconciled to the Sinner, and become his Friend. They call'd our Saviour Christ a friend to <HI>Publicans</HI> and <HI>Sinners.</HI> God is a friend of Publicans
<PB N="48" REF="001020_0060_0FAEEC4821645ED0"/>
and Sinners, and as it were Courts their Friendship. He is so far from being im∣placable to his greatest Enemies, that he is first in moving for Peace, and by his Ambassadors beseeches them to be re∣conciled.</P>
<P>Thus in general, There is Life for the Children of Death. More particularly, There is a removal of Death, and Life that is recovered.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>There is a removal of Death here im∣plyed</HI>; or Death is taken away. That is, All evil of Sin, and Suffering. As to the evil of Sin.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>There is a freedom from the Guiltiness.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>From the power of it.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>There is a freedom from the Guiltiness of Sin.</HI> And Gospel Ministers are di∣rected by Christ, <HI>To give knowledge of Salvation to his People by the Remission of their Sins, Luke</HI> 1.77. Not that the Fast or Action it self can be remitted; be∣cause that which is done is done, and cannot be said not to be done. <HI>Factum infectum reddi n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quit.</HI> Ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Guilt of that evil Act, which is an obligation to punishment may be remitted: and this is properly, <HI>Pardon of Sin.</HI> Neither does

Remission change the nature of Sin, that that which is Sin should be counted no sin: or that Evil should be called Good, <HI>Isa.</HI> 5.20. Sin is as really sin after pardon, as before: only Pardon frees from the Guilt of sin, takes away, <HI>Meritum Paenae,</HI> the deserved Punishment, which is a taking away, not from the sin, but from the Sinner only. Still, <HI>The wages of sin is Death</HI>; that is, deserves it. Though this Death is not actually inflicted on him to whom Sin is pardoned. Neither a∣gain, is the Rigour of the Law relaxed by the pardon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f sin: only it does not exert its conde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing Power over the persons of B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lieve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, because Christ has already suffer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d for their Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. But still the Law remains, and ever will remain a Sin Condemning, and Sin Avenging Law.

of the Law, but a full Executi∣on of it, full satisfaction given to it. The whole Debt is paid to the utmost farthing, by Christ our Surety; whence all the Life, Glory and Happiness that follows hereupon comes in by Grace. But then,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>There is the freedom from the Power and Dominion of sin; also from the filth and pollution, as well as Guilt and Obliga¦tion to punishment.</HI> The former is ex∣prest in the Sinners Justification, by the imputed Righteousness of Christ. The latter in his Sanctification by infused Ho∣liness from the Spirit of Christ. Man fallen from God is become a Captive to sin, and is forced to serve divers Lusts, of which is true, what <HI>Solinus</HI> says of the several kind of Serpents in <HI>Africa; Quantus nominum, tantus mortium nume∣rus</HI> But the Gospel preaches Delive∣rance to these Cap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ives: there is a Re∣lease from the bondage of Corruption, from the T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nny o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sin and▪ Satan in part begun here, an opening the Prison Doors to them that are bound. Then, as to the Evil of Suffering, or conse∣quents of sin, there is a perfect freedom
<PB N="51" REF="001020_0063_0FAEEC4C0E8A1390"/>
to be obtained. The cause being remo∣ved, the effect ceaseth. Sin is the cause of Death, it gives life unto Death; therefore if Sin be killed, Death dyes wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h it; The same stroke destroys them both; Sin and Death are contemporary they live and dy together. So that if once a man be gotten free from the guilt and power of Sin, he is also loosed from the bonds of Death, and from the Pains of Hell for ever. For, though it be <HI>appointed for all once to dy,</HI> and expe∣rience confirms the truth hereof, that <HI>as by one man Sin entred into the world, and Death by Sin,</HI> so Death passeth on all sorts of men, and will do upon all of every sort, because all have Sinned; and excess of Sin, procures untimely Death to many an one; yet 'tis as t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ue, where sin is taken away, there the Second <HI>Death shall have no power, Rev.</HI> 20.6.

<P N="2">2. <HI>As there is a Removal of D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>h, that is all Evil of Sin and Suffering; so there is a Restoring unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that is all man∣ner of Good, of Grace <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and Glory here∣after.</HI> The vilest of Sinners may be made holy and righteous now, happy and blessed for evermore. Indeed we should not too nicely distinguish between these: Freedom from Death, and a right to Eternal Life; as if one could be obtained without the other, which is impossible: For certainly not to dy, is to live; not to Dy Eternally, is to Live Eternally. But though these be not distinct in themselves, yet may we speak distinctly of them. As</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Sinner may become Holy and Righteous, not only guiltless</HI> (as we Saw before) <HI>but righteous in the sight of God.</HI> A Believing Sinner is not only free from sin, but full of Righteousness: In some sence as righteous as Christ himself, for he is righteous in the Righteousness of Christ, which is every way perfect and compleat; that the Law or Justice it self can find no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ault or fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w therein;

and is relatively, im<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>atively theirs that by Faith are united to Christ.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>There is also a real inherent Ho∣liness and Righteousness by a Restoration of the Image of God in the Soul</HI> Man that is born a Sinner may be born again.

Then,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Sinner also may be Happy.</HI> This necessarily follows on the former. A man cannot but be happy, if he become holy: Sin and Misery, Holiness and Happiness are Twins, and will never admit of any separation. <HI>Those that are Justified are Sanctified, and they that are Sanctifi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d are Glorifi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d</HI> Happiness is in∣choate in this life, and consummate in the next.</P>

</LIST>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That Life, whether of Justification, Sanctification or Glory, is from God origi∣nally.</HI> Justification in the Acq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ittance from Sin, Guilt, and imputation of Christ's Righteousness, is <HI>Gods gift</HI>: Hence he is said to be <HI>the Justifier of him that believeth in Jesus, Rom.</HI> 3 26.

<P N="2">2. <HI>This Justification is</HI> Free, <HI>and thus it is a Gift.</HI> Rom. 5.15. Tis again

and again called, <HI>The Free-Gift of Righ∣teousness to Justification of Life</HI>; and we are said to be justified <HI>freely</HI> by his Grace through the Redemption. But you will ask? Quest. <HI>How can this be free, since Jesus Christ has paid and perfor∣med all? Has fulfilled all Righteousness; done and suffered all that the Law requires for our Justification: Does not therefore the compleatness of Christ's Satisfaction lessen the Freeness and Greatness of Gods Love in pardoning Sinners? Ans.</HI> Not a whit, but these consist well together. Life is by the Righteousness of Christ, and yet a free Gift; This is the admirableness of it, that Justice and Grace meet thus; that Justice and Truth should be fully satisfied, and yet Mercy and Grace highly exalted Neither is Grace in Scrip∣ture ever opposed to Christ's merit, but to ours. If we our selves had made the Satisfaction, Justice it self had absol∣ved us; but the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ches of Free Grace will appear to them that shall consider these things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That 'tis God himself finds out and accepts the way of our Reconci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iation.</HI> Men or Angels could never have invented it.
<PB N="56" REF="001020_0068_0FAEEC4F52D4E858"/>
Besides, God might have refused to ac¦cept of a Surety: This was free, and in this sence, the life of Believers are s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id to be given unto Christ; he has bought them, purchased them with a great price, <HI>redeemed them with his own Blood; as they are given him,</HI> Joh. 17. <HI>Thine t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> were,</HI> that is, in the hands of Gods Justice, and he has given them to the Lord Jesus to be redeemed. Hence, its truly said of the Apostle, <HI>Rom</HI> 3 24 <HI>We are justified freely by his Grace,</HI> yet or tho' <HI>through the Redemption that is in Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Christ himself is Gods gift.</HI> Joh. 3.16. <HI>God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son,</HI> &amp;c. God has gi¦ven his first born for our Transgressi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n: <HI>He spared not his own Son, but freely gave him up for us all, Rom.</HI> 8 32. <HI>To us a Son is given,</HI> Isai. 9 6.

<P N="2">2. <HI>This leads us to the contemplation of the Divine Philanthropy, or Admirable Love of God to mankind.

<P>It also leads into the Dep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hs of Gods Wisdom, that has contrived the way of life for Sinners, after a positive Sentence of Death was declared. This would not only have set the Wisdom of man, but posed quite the Heavenly Intelligences, Angels themselves, to have found out a Way; wherein the <HI>Truth</HI> of God might be Established, his <HI>Justice</HI> satisfyed, the Rights and <HI>Honour</HI> of <HI>Holiness</HI> Vindicated, and maintained, and yet the Guilty, polluted and condemned C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>inal be pardoned, justifyed and saved Everlast∣ingly.

We cannot be born under a more happy Star than that which leadeth unto Christ a Saviour, by whom this life and im∣mortality is brought to light.</P>
<P>Consequently,</P>
<P>This shows the extreem misery of those that perish under the Gospel. Death will be more deadly to such than others. There are none so miserable as those who either have, or might have been happy. The thoughts of former advan∣tages neglected, will add to their present and future sufferings. Time was when they might have had pardon and Eternal Life <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or asking, or accepting; but now they must perish without remedy, and that more dreadfully than other Sinners Gospel Sinners have the worst Death; For Necessary Death would not be nigh so dreadful as a Voluntary. Now Death to those that live under the Gospel is of choice; they will Death rather

than Life; wherefore their Condem∣nation is not only most <HI>certain</HI> and <HI>just,</HI> but most <HI>fearful</HI> of all. Thus the danger is proportionable to the Priviledge. But, I hasten to an Use of <HI>Exhortation</HI> in two words, principally.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>To a firm and fixed Believing of this Truth, that Eternal Life is Gods Gift through Jesus Christ our Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>To a speedy and earnest Addressing God in Christ, for the bestowing this Gift, or obtaining the benefits therein included.</HI></P>

<P>The Duty of believing this might be further pressed from the mischief and misery of Despair, which is most inju∣rious to God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, injurious to the Truth, Power, Goodness and Grace of God; also most pernicious to our selves; which is not only adding Sin to Sin, but a sealing up the Guilt of all other sins. Hereby we loose an Infinite Blessing, and incur an infinite Curse in the room.

This we certainly find, that great Sins are of∣ten made preparations to Conversion; not in their own nature, that's impossi∣ble; but by the wise and gracious Dis∣posal of God; and some Reasons of this Dispensation might be guessed at. To shew the insufficiency of Nature to sach a work (as Conversion is) so the more to Glorify himself, his Patience, Power and Mercy; 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.16 For this cause (says <HI>Paul) I obtained mercy, that in me Jesus Christ might shew forth all-long-suf∣fering.</HI> Herein also is the exceeding Greatness of Gods Power Exerted: the same as in Raising up our Lord Jesus from the Dead; and the Riches of his Grace to such Sinners is glorified in his Saints, and admired <HI>in all them that be∣lieve.</HI> Particularly, the fulness, freeness, tenderness, and compassionateness of his mercy to such as are most deeply in∣volved in sin and misery, are made glo∣riously c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>picuous.</P>

and efficacy of his Sacrifice remains for ever.</P>
<P>The Conversion of some of extraor∣dinary Guilt now and then, proclaims to the World that this Fountain of his Blood is inexhaustible; that the vertue of it is not spent or drained, tho' so much has been drawn out of it for above Five thousand years already.</P>
<P>And doubtless, the greater Fruits of this Grace is expected from such Con∣verts in ways of Thankfulness, Love and Obedience.</P>

and no less Fatal. Yea, (as Divines ac∣count) where <HI>That</HI> has slain its Thousands, <HI>This</HI> has slain its Ten Thousands.</P>
<P N="1">1.

God is now merciful to the Penitent; yet will be faithful to his threatnings as well as Promises: and all Despisers of his Goodness and Forbearance will be found to have treasured up wrath against the day of wrath, and the Revelation of his righteous Judgment.</P>
<P>The <HI>Counsil</HI> also is twofold.</P>

<P>It were better there were no Offer of Grace, if there be no Acceptance of it. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> avails not that there is a general Exhibition, if there be not a special and particular Appplication of it. What tho' the Wells of Salvation are set open, if we draw not Water out of those Wells, we perish notwithstanding. Here is Water of Life running by us, but if we refuse to drink, we may dy of our thirst. Manna falls in all quarters of <HI>Israels</HI> Camp, the people may gather it, yea are commanded so to do: But they may pine to Death if they look not after it, and gather it in the season: <HI>Naaman</HI> is Leporous, the Prophet tells him of a Cure, of a Bath that will restore his Flesh; but if he will not vouchsafe to take the pains, he may remain a Leper still. The Prodigal whiles he remains in

a far Country is never the better that there is bread enough in his Fathers house: He must come and submit him∣self to his Father, take the Dole from his hand, or else it were all one to him, as if there were nothing to be had: There is Wine and Milk enough to be had without mony &amp; without price; but what benefit can this be, if we come not where it is to be had, and buy it on the Terms? Who is the Richer for the <HI>Pearl,</HI> that has not made it his own by the purchase of it? Tho' Life &amp; Salvation is graciously offered in the Gospel to every man; y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> there is no man will be the better for it, that does not hearken to this gracious tender, and apply himself to the way of obtaining benefit by it. It is not the opportunity, but the im∣provement of it that will make us happy.</P>
<P>Many Arguments might be used as Motives to quicken and strengthen our Desires and Endeavours after Life. I shall hint at these two only. The <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣cessity</HI> and <HI>Excellency</HI> of this Life.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Life is necessary, and a necessity is laid in our endeavours after it.</HI> There is no
<PB N="79" REF="001020_0091_0FAEEC67681A6F08"/>
way, but one of these two; either Life or Death; if we Live not, we must dye: There is no middle between Life and Death; nothing between Heaven and Hell. It's true, now there is a kind of medium between these: But the time is coming when there will be no other places but these two; the only Recepta∣cles of all mankind. If therefore we cannot bear to think of Eternal Death, of an Everlasting Separation and Seclu∣sion from the Face and Favour of God, unless we are willing to be shut out of Heaven, deprived of all the joyes and pleasures of it, to be for ever excommu∣nicated from the blessed Company of God, Angels and Saints: And unless we can endure to be shut up in Hell, to be unto all Eternity, incarcerated in the Dungeon of Darkness, Cohabiting with Devils and Damned Spirits, to be sub∣ject unto all those miseries, which the Infinite Wisdom of God can invent, and the Hand of his Infinite Power can in∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ict: O let us be earnest, instant and constant in our Endeavours for Life; for there is no other Choice. One of these must, and will be the portion of
<PB N="80" REF="001020_0092_0FAEEC685E8C2120"/>
every Son and Daughter of <HI>Adam,</HI> ei∣ther to be happy in life, or miserable in Death, and that for ever. Now God sets Life and Death before us, and we have our choice: If we do not choose the one, we shall never be able to refuse the other. We must needs get life then, because the mischiefs of the want of it are insufferable. If there could be an Annihilation, if we might be reduced to our first principle of nothing again, if we might again not be, and so not be miserable, the matter were less, tho' we were not the Subjects of this Life and Blessedness: Better never to have been born, than being so, to fall short of E∣ternal Glory: for then endless misery will be our portion.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Excellency of this Life well thought upon, may invigorate all our desires and endeavours after it.</HI> Natural Life of all natural good, is the most excellent; nothing bears so high a price as Life, nothing is to be valued with it; its cal∣led the precious Life, and life puts a price on all other things; they are there∣fore good and precious as they are means of the being, continuance and comfort
<PB N="81" REF="001020_0093_0FAEEC68D0E24018"/>
of it, and they are valued according to their conducement hereunto: Such is the rate, the degree of their Excellency; but the means are ever inferiour to the end; so that Life Temporal is incompa∣rably above all other things; but Life Eternal is more worth than a thousand Lives: It is infinitely better both in the nature or kind, and in the duration of it. In respect of the nature, it includes all other kinds, and all possible perfecti∣on of the reasonable Creature. It con∣sists in the removal of all Evil, Sin and Misery: and the position of all Good, H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>liness and Happiness in Soul and Bo∣dy for ever. It were as easy to open Heaven it sel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and show you that, as to open this Life, or tell the Contents of it. <HI>Eye has not seen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ear heard, neither can it enter into the heart of man to con∣ceive,</HI> much less fully comprehend what this Life <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> In respect of duration▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.

<P>THE Terms plain, or easy of Explication. <HI>Way</HI> in Scripture, signifies the course of Life. The Actions of man are the steps hereof; which according to the quality of them, do difference their Way

and give <HI>it</HI> the Character of Good or Evil. <HI>Cleanse,</HI> or purify: As a man walks in a clean or foul Way.

So then, here is the young mans <HI>Practical Catechism,</HI> set down by Question and Answer.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>Wherewithall shall a Young man cleanse his way</HI>?</P>
<P>A. <HI>By taking heed thereto according to thy word.</HI></P>
<P>The Psalmist here applyes the power of Gods word to this special Age of man, Happily, Because himself was now young, and because young Persons ought especi∣ally to look to their way and practice; and to intimate that the word is able to cleanse their Way, which is most subject to Error, Obliquity, and Impurity. Yet, not excluding all other Ages and Sexes, for it behoves every Man, Woman and Child, particularly in their Youth to
<PB N="85" REF="001020_0097_0FAEEC6C106A06C0"/>
mind this. As <HI>Austin</HI> saith, It denyes not, that any of riper years, or decrepid Age (if they have neglected so long) should make hast and cleanse their ways: But, it requires and shews, that it is to be begun in Youth and continued even to old Age. That none are ever exempted from this Care; but must even from their Childhood or younger years look to this point, To cleanse their ways from Sin, and have respect to the Word of God for this end, to Direct and Assist in a pure Way.</P>
<P>In the Answer is set forth the Excel∣lency of Gods Word, in the use and sin∣gular effect thereof; as it is both a Rule and Instrument of our cleansing, together with the manner how it is to be applyed and made use of.</P>
<P><HI>By taking heed thereto according to the Word of God.</HI> Or studying and endea∣vouring an holy Conformity to Gods will revealed in his Word. And 'tis not a slighty and careless but diligent &amp; cir∣cumspect walking by this Rule, which is here required. If God had not given Direction about this, we should have been at an utter loss, and without a close Ap∣plication
<PB N="86" REF="001020_0098_0FAEEC6D3AF5FE80"/>
hereof, all will be in vain still.</P>
<P>But, I begin with the Question. In which some things are supposed, and something enquired.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>'Tis here taken for granted that all men naturally have a desire after Happiness: and in Youth this inc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ination is strongest.</HI> Some kind and degree hereof is common to all that partake of the reasonable na∣ture. There must therefore be an uni∣versal Good, or the inclinations of nature would be in vain, <HI>Psal.</HI> 4 6. <HI>Who will sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w us any good</HI>: Good is the Cry of the World. It is intended in the very Na∣ture of desire, as well as desire of Nature: for every thing which is desired, is desi∣red as Good▪ (<HI>sub ratione Boni.</HI>) As God implanted in us Affections of Aversation, to avoid what is Evil: so Affections o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Choice and pursuit to follow after what is good Well then, out of a Principle of self Love, All would be happy and not miserable, they would love good, and have it always. Notwithstanding the Di∣versity of men, they all agree in this one thing. Though 'tis as true also, that the generality of men pursue a false happi∣ness; or seek it where it is not to be had.

Yea, all without Grace are mistaken in it.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Some mistake as to the End or Obj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct.</HI> Calling and Choosing Evil for Good; or at best embrace the shadow instead of the substance: placing their Affecti∣ons upon, and expecting satisfaction from things <HI>unworthy of the former, or uncapable</HI> of the la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter.

'Tis true indeed, that as all men desire to be happy; so they apply themselves to those means, which to them appear con∣venient for the obtaining it. And by the methods or courses which men take in their life, we may judge or gu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss at the end or final Happiness which they choose or pursue. And in our Obs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r∣vations we may make this further Re∣mark: That every Natural man is fra∣ming a Happiness according to his tem∣per. The Apprehensions hereof are an∣swerable to the dispositions of the per∣son; For Faelicity is desc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ibed to be the pleasures which arises from the harmo∣nious agreement between the Object
<PB N="88" REF="001020_0100_0FAEE896D4DB62D0"/>
and the Appetite. Now man by his o∣riginal and contracted Corruption is al¦together carnal; he cleaves to debasing and defising Objects, and is only qualifi¦ed for sensual satisfactions. Thus of the first thing supposed, <HI>viz.</HI> That all men naturally desire Happiness, and are framing one to themselues according to the various Temper or Distemper of their Natures, <HI>and likewise shape their course accordingly.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It is here supposed to be a matter of great Concernment to all, especially in youth, to be studious and inquisitive concerning the right way to true and eternal Blessedness</HI> Our mistakes about it will co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t us dear.

Those that will try experiments, smart for it in the issue; will surely come home by weeping cross, if ever at all. It's good therefore, it's best to be early in this Enqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y. Our Saviour Christ at the Age of Twelve years was found answering and asking questions in the Temple: and he was a young man who came unto him with that question, <HI>Good Master, Tell me what I

Proposition; That all those Actions which proceed from corrupted Nature, even from first to last are sinful, and have need of cleaning. Or, every way of the Natural man is filthy and abo∣minable, both internal, or intentional, as thoughts and actions; external, and transient, as words and actions. The ways of the Heart, ways of the Tongue, of the Hands, Feet and whole man, in∣ward and outward. There was a time since the Fall, when the whole world was corrupt, <HI>Gen</HI> 6.5 6 <HI>God saw the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually; and that all Flesh had corrupted his way.</HI></P>

Both we defile our ways, and our ways us; or we by that which is in us defile our Actions, and then these reflect a spot of Guilt and Filth upon us again; even as the Sow wallowing in the mire, then tumbleth in the Grass, and being wash∣ed returns to wallowing again: So the Scripture sets it forth; therefore man must needs be unclean; yea, the ways of some are so brutish, that you may track them in their filthy paths, out of one com∣pany and place into another, in their words and deeds, at home and abroad. The Natural man defiles every step he takes, and the filth thereof redounds to himself: Such is the way of young ones especially; if you trace them from their Childhood, what stubbornness, falseness, and multitude of Indecencies: In Youth what Pride, Wantonness, Dalliance, Drunkenness, Self pollution, and Forni∣cation; even such as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, and some into Blood<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>guiltiness: But I speak here of the common paths wherein you may track our Youth up and down, in Ly∣ing, Swearing, Cursing, Rayling, Filch∣ing, Sabbath breaking, Night-walking,

Works of Darkness which bring both shame and sorrow when discovered and brought to light. Thus, though there is one Sin which by peculiar use bears the Name of Uncleanness, yet all Sin is so: both in the nature and effect. There is a Turpitude in it self, and stai∣neth the person guilty of it. <HI>Can a man touch Pitch, and not be defiled therewith?</HI> Every Sin is a Transgression of the Law of God: Now the Law is holy and pure; therefore Sin is filth and uncleanness.

to the full use of Reason, to enquire how they may cleanse their hearts and ways from sin</HI>: Or, Cleansing our heart and ways is a meet and necessary Object for every mans meditation, study and enquiry; tho' more especially for younger ones. Because such are commonly void of wisdom and experience, heady, wilful, and impatient of Admonition, full of violent passions, stronger lusts, and ex∣posed to more and greater Temptations, with other reasons to be given hereaf∣ter. Indeed this is the one thing needful for all, whether man or woman, young or old to look about them, to get them∣selves purified from their sin; and so to order their course aright here, as that they may see Gods Salvation.</P>
<P>The General Reasons for all.</P>
<P N="1">1. Because, <HI>As is the Way, so will be the end.</HI> Sinful and fil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hy ways are the Devils paths that lead down to Hell, and the Chambers of Destruction.

way of Grace tendeth to Life. Tho' God is no Respecter of persons, yet he has a great respect to all the actions of man; and will render to every one ac∣cording to his deeds. <HI>Rom.</HI> 2 6 <HI>Job</HI> 34.11. The work of a man stall he render unto him, and cause every one to find accor∣ding to his ways.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>'Tis certain God hateth the man that walketh in a filthy course; He is of pure Eyes, and cannot endure iniquity.</HI> This is the thing which his Soul hates where e∣ver he sees or finds it. He who is Glo∣rious in Holiness abominates all ways of Filthiness: and no unclean <HI>person shall dwell with him, they shall be shut out of his Presence for ever.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>It's a token of a heart cleansed, that is thus affected, and Contra.</HI> Both for the prose it, that God has begun his good work, and for the future, that they shall obtain a thorow cleansing from all their sins; as the Leper found upon his co∣ming and crying to our Saviour, <HI>Matth.</HI> 3.2. <HI>Lord, if thou wilt thou canst make me clean; Jesus put forth his hand, and touch∣ing him, said, I will be thou clean, and im∣mediately his Leprosy was cleansed.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="001020_0113_0FAEE8A034D83A90"/>But as the careless world now carrieth the matter, it seems very impertinent and ridiculous to propose such things to Youth: what have they to do with so serious a wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k? these are too grave mat∣ters for that licentious Age; when Old Age has snowed upon their heads, and the smart experience of more years in the world has ripened them for so se∣vere a Discipline, then 'twill be time to think of cleansing their way: or entring on a new course of Repentance and Sub∣mission to God.

<P>The special Arguments or Reasons to put Young people on the Duty and Practice hereof.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Because even Youths &amp; Childrens way is of great concern and consequence.</HI> No

But Young men will not obey the voice of their Teachers. <HI>To Hearken</HI> is a proper∣ty as far off from Youth as any other vertue whatsoever: <HI>Yea, if this were in them, nothing would be wanting.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Youth is most likely to be out of the way.</HI> Yea, none so Young, but are out. All are born with their backs towards God, and as soon as they can go, are going further astray from him.

know them to be so, for they themselves have been young. Yet few of these but think they can guide themselves best, care not to be controuled. Youth is in it self most inclined and disposed to err, through weakness of Judgment, conceit∣edness of Wisdom, headiness in choice, vehemence of Affections, inordinate and excessive love of Liberty, and to all these I might add, a variety of more &amp; strong∣er Temptations: none so tempted as Youth. Little Children can't be so ser∣viceable to the Devil; and old men are spent, however they have chosen their way already.

<PB N="108" REF="001020_0120_0FAEE99372A5E588"/>
consider that all their Actions are <HI>Coram Judice,</HI> in presence of such a Judge who will not want Witness to convict them, but can Summons a thousand within their own Breasts, if there were no other without: and if their heart condemn them, God is greater, and knoweth all things.</P>
<P>Well, If these things be so, the main Enquiry for every one is this in our Text, <HI>Whereby shall I come to change my Heart and Wayes</HI>? or all my ways, inter∣nal and external, secret and open: Not who will shew me any good, a good Match, a good Bargain, a good Trade, or place to set up in: But how may I become pure, and be kept clean from the filthiness of Sin? How shall I get Sins past pardoned and purged, and be kept unspotted for the Future, being my self so full of Corruption, &amp; living in such a filthy Age? But O the stupid Block∣ishness of the World! Why do we hear no more either Younger or Old, thus Crying out of themselves, <HI>Unclean, Un∣clean</HI>! I see my self in an Odious State and have followed a wicked course, how shall I get freed and cleansed therefrom!

Or, because the most are setled on the Lees of their Sins, de∣light in their self polluting Courses, re∣solve to continue in them: Like the <HI>Collim,</HI> make account they shall foul themselves again, therefore will not wash.</P>
<P>Oh, But if God should shew you your Ways and Faces in a glass, you would Abhor your selves in Dust and Ashes. Many of you that think your selves wonderous pure, would (as <HI>Job</HI> saith) Think your own cloaths defile you, or you your cloaths. What Filthy Souls have many of you, Men and Women, Young and Old, Never yet washed in the Blood of Jesus Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ist, in Tears of true Repentance, and Laver of Regene∣ration, but continue to besmear your selves with your daily sins.</P>
<P>It may be thus pronounced to you all, that if you have not as yet come to make this Question, &amp; that Sincerely, hear∣tily, affectionately and with deep desire,
<PB N="110" REF="001020_0122_0FAEE9951496FF00"/>
as <HI>David</HI> here did, you are not of his Spirit, nor yet in the way to Heaven; and if so you abide, shall be shut out with Dogs, or unclean Persons.</P>
<P>As for you Old Sinners that have been wallowing &amp; soaking in your miry Filth for so many years, until this Day, and yet take no care to be washed. Did you but see your Filthy Souls in the Glass of Gods Law, and would reflect on the dreadful Stain of your life past, what shame and confusion of Face would cover you? Think how you will look God in the Face another day, when All the hidden things of Darkness shall be made manifest before the World of Angels and Men. How will you hold up your Heads in that Day? Do you look to come where <HI>David</HI> is? The Devil will as soon, except you be transformed, Changed &amp; Sancti∣fyed throughout. Well then, should Young men cleanse their Way, Is it not high time for you? I will only Item such with what the Spirit says, <HI>Rev.</HI> 22.11. <HI>The time is at hand, he that is unjust, let him be unjust still, and he which is filthy let him be filthy still.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="001020_0123_0FAEE995D7205D48"/>I hasten therefore to an Exhortation, wherein I earnestly address this Great Assembly and Concourse of People, be∣seeching every one, Old and Young, Male and Female.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>To Consider your ways now in time.</HI> See what they are, or have been, and what their End will be. Remember our life is for an End, I mean an end∣less End. It's not only our Business therefore to escape Death and Eternal Damnation, but to Enjoy Life, and E∣verlasting Communion with God; or to have an intire Fruition of the best Good for ever. The End (you see) is of greatest Consequence, for that deter∣mines the Final Happiness or Unhappi∣ness of any person or course. It's not the way rough or plain, but the End whereto it tendeth: The difficulty of the way is no wise comparable either with the Wo, or Happiness of the End. It's not what way or Weather thou tra∣vellest through, but where thou must lodge at night. O that we may be eve∣ry one <HI>wise therefore to consider our latter End.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That the End depends on the way.</HI>
<PB N="112" REF="001020_0124_0FAEE9969D0B45B0"/>
According to the course we steer in this life, we shall certainly arrive at Death: either in the fair Havens of Rest and Glory, with the pure and undefiled, or else in the Dead Sea of Wrath and Misery, where all the Sodomites and Unclean persons are immerst Eternally.</P>
<P>Know then, Here is Life and Death set before us all, and our steps are every day carrying us to Heaven or Hell. <HI>Hinc illud melior est Claudus in via quam Cursor praeter viam.</HI> Better to be limp∣ing in the way, than running besides it. A word for Backsliders, or such as ha∣ving once escaped the pollution of the world, and again <HI>entangled and overcome,</HI> we have in 2 Pet. 2.21. <HI>The latter end of such is worse than their beginning.</HI></P>
<P>As for the Directions needful in this Case, they might most properly c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me under the third and last Proposition in the Doctrine, <HI>viz</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>PROPOSITION III.</HEAD>
<P><HI>That the heedful observing of our Ways from our Youth up, according to the Word of God▪ is an effectual means to cleanse and keep them clean from all sinful Defilements.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="001020_0125_0FAEE99767D53C30"/>But I shall wholly pass this, Referring you to the late Learned Composures of some who have handled this point with greater accuracy and skill than I may pretend unto. That which I principally aim'd at in this Enterprize was further to excite the Generation of young peo∣ple (great Numbers whereof were ex∣pected, and accordingly are here gather∣ed together on the solemn Occasion be∣fore us.) <HI>To search and cleanse their ways,</HI> To shew them the necessity hereof, and urge them to the practice of the Duty, rather than give Directions about it, which is better done to their hand alrea∣dy.</P>
<P>I shall therefore conclude with a word of Motive further, not from pre∣cept, but example; not of one coming from the Dead, (as <HI>Dives</HI> desired might be sent for the warning of his Brethren) but of one going to the Dead, whose counsel and caution may be as effectual, and will to all considerate persons.</P>
<P>Then, Besides what has been hinted already; that Unholiness cuts off from the Blessing of God in this life: often procures untimely Death; and at length
<PB N="114" REF="001020_0126_0FAEE9984B8E2910"/>
shuts out of Heaven, because nothing that defileth or maketh abomination shall e∣ver enter in there, <HI>Rev.</HI> 21.27.</P>
<P>Let me add, or rather present unto you this Solemn Example of one before us at this time, who has been notoriously defiled in her way, and is now hasting to a shameful End of a wicked Life; One that is immediately to Dye for her Sins, though we hope not in her Sins. Such an Example as has never been heretofore in this place; God of his in¦finite mercy grant (if it be his will) that there may never be occasion for a∣nother: But make all that see and hear thereof to stand in aw, and do not any such abominable things as she has done: To whom I had thought never to have spoken a word in this world more, (I mean in Publick) and now the time is so near expired, it can be but a word.</P>
<P>And what shall I say unto thee, <HI>Esther,</HI> from such a Text as this? <HI>Thy ways have been all filthy, thy whole Walk, a walk af∣ter the Flesh; thy course a course of filthy Communication and Conversation.</HI> O Un∣clean, Unclean! As if possest with an
<PB N="115" REF="001020_0127_0FAEE998DCE5CBF0"/>
unclean Devil, or with as many as <HI>Ma∣ry Magdalen,</HI> yea rather with a Legion; thou hast served the Devil an intire Prenticeship of one and twenty years in filthy ways of one sort or other. But, is thy time of Bondage now expired? O Rejoice thou in the Jubilee, and mag∣nify the Lord who has Redeemed thee, and that at so dear a rate, as with the price of his own Blood: Did he vouch∣safe to look upon thee, when thou wast in thy blood, even when thou wast in thy Blood-guiltiness and Filthiness, and to say unto thee Live! instead of letting thee sink and be drowned in thy Gore and Guilt, has raised thee to the Hope of Pardon and Life Eternal? O Admire, Admire the Riches of Divine Mercy &amp; Free Grace! Admiration is all the Glo∣ry thou canst give to God for his Grace. Jesus Christ will come at the last Day to be Glo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ified in his Saints, and admi∣red <HI>in all them that believe</HI> I pray send thine Admirations before hand to attend him at his Coming.</P>
<P>But what preparations has thy Soul made to appear at Gods Tribunal before this Day be ended? Art thou like to be
<PB N="116" REF="001020_0128_0FAEE999E92B0C18"/>
found choathed in the Righteousnesses of the Saints, both imputed and inherent Righteousness, not only justified by Grace, but sanctifyed by the Holy Spi∣rit also. The former is to give thee right to the latter, to make thee fitter for Heaven and Happiness: Heaven is the most Holy place, there is the most holy Company &amp; society of God, Angels, &amp; Spirits of Just ones that are made per∣fect in Holiness. Hast thou desired and laboured for Holiness to Sanctify thee, as well as Righteousness to justify thee? what means hast thou used to get thy Soul purged as well as sin pardoned: Hast thou been at the Fountain which God has opened for <HI>Judah,</HI> and for the <HI>House of David?</HI> Hast thou waited and prayed with <HI>David, Psal</HI> 51. <HI>Wash me throughly from my sins, purge me with Hyssop,</HI> refer∣ring to the Blood of Sprinkling, that Bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od of the Lamb of God, which alone cleanseth from all sin; or hast thou thought a few Tears sufficient for this? Verily, if thy Head were a Fountain, thine Eyes rivers of waters, &amp; if thence thou couldest pour out such a Flood as would even Deluge the world again, it
<PB N="117" REF="001020_0129_0FAEE99AC9D401A8"/>
would not wash out the stain of one of thy least sins: A drop of the Blood of Christ is infinitely better, though all of that be necessary.</P>
<P>Once more then <HI>Esther,</HI> Look unto that Jesus who came by Blood and Wa∣ter both; by the one to purchase Par∣don and Heaven for thee, if thou Be∣lievest. By the other to purify and prepare thee for it. And God of his Infinite Grace give unto thee an <HI>Open and Abundant Entrance thereinto: For the sake of him who is Priest for ever, and Liveth still to make Intercession for Sin∣ners.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE Declaration &amp; Confession OF Esther Rodgers, Of <HI>Kittery</HI> in the Province of <HI>Main,</HI> in <HI>New England,</HI> Single woman.</HEAD>
<P>I was born at <HI>Kittery</HI> sometime in <HI>May,</HI> 1680. At the Age of Thirteen came to live as an Apprentice to Mr. <HI>Joseph Woodbridge</HI> of <HI>Newbury.</HI> Had little or no thoughts of God or Re∣ligion, though Living in a Religious Fa∣mily; was taught to Read, Learned Mr. <HI>Cottons</HI> Catechism, and had frequent op∣portunities of going to Publick Meetings; but was a careless Observer of Sabbaths, and Hearer of Sermons; no Word that
<PB N="122" REF="001020_0134_0FAEE99F94B8B3E8"/>
ever I heard or read making any Impres∣sion upon my Heart, (as I Remember) Neither did I at all give my self to Secret Prayer, or any other Duty that concern∣ed the Salvation of my Soul. And because I thus neglected God, refused his Coun∣sil, and would not walk in his Ways, therefore he justly gave me up to my own hearts Lusts, and ways of Wicked∣ness.</P>
<P>About the Age of Seventeen, I was left to fall into that foul Sin of Unclean∣ness, suffering my self to be defiled by a <HI>Negro</HI> Lad living in the same House. After I perceived that I was wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h Child, I meditated how to prevent coming to Publick Shame; Satan presently setting in with his Temptation, I soon comply∣ed and resolved to Murder the Child, if ever I should have one born alive: and continued in my wicked purpose all a∣long, till I had the fatal Opportunity of putting it into Execution. Being deli∣vered of a Living Child, I used means presently to stop the breath of it, and kept it hid in an upper Room, till the Darkness of the Night following, gave advantage for a Private Burial in the Garden.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="001020_0135_0FAEE9A0B4577D88"/>All this was done in Secret, no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er∣son living whatsoever, no not so much as the Father of the Child himself was privy to my disposal of it, or knew that I ever had such a Child.</P>
<P>Afterwards reflecting on what I had done, was followed with some Awak∣ening, Frights and Convictions during my abode at Mr. <HI>Woodbridges,</HI> which was about half a year. Yet, never mak∣ing any serious Address to God for par∣don of these my great and hainous Sins. But thence I went to <HI>Piscatequa,</HI> where I lived in a publick House, and soon got over and rid of all my Fears, and e∣ven all thoughts thereof, giving my self up to other wicked Company and ways of Evil.</P>
<P>About a year after, I returned to <HI>Newbury</HI> to Mr. <HI>Joseph Woodbridges</HI> again, where my former Sins came fresh to Re∣membrance, and troubled me a while; which together with other reasons, oc∣casioned my Removal to another place in the Town. But there also I took all Opportunities to follow my old Trade of running out a Nights, or entertaining my Sinful Companions in a back part
<PB N="124" REF="001020_0136_0FAEE9A10FED4928"/>
of the House. And there I fell into the like horrible Pit (as before) <HI>viz.</HI> of Carnal Pollution with the <HI>Negro</HI> man be∣longing to that House. And being with Child again, I was in as great concern to know how to hide this as the former. Yet did not so soon resolve the Murder∣ing of it, but was continually hurried in my thoughts, and undetermined till the last hour. I went forth to be deli∣vered in the Field, and dropping my Child by the side of a little Pond, (whe∣ther alive, or still Born I cannot tell) I covered it over with Dirt and Snow, and speedily returned home again. B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t being Suspected and Examined, about having had a Child since my going out, made little or no answer (that I remem∣ber) till the next Morning The Child being found by some Neighbours was brought in, &amp; laid before my Face, to my horrible Shame &amp; Terror; under which Confusion I remained during my Con∣finement at <HI>Newbury,</HI> being about one Month, Thinking only of the punish∣ment I was like to suffer, without any true concernedness as to my Sins against God, or the State of my Immortal Soul;

till some time after I came into <HI>Ipswich</HI> Prison; when and where it pleased the Great and Gracious God to work upon my heart, as in the following Relation I have given account of.</P>

<HEAD>A Relation of her Experience, both of some Conviction and Comfort received in the Prison: Communicated to a certain Gen∣tlewoman of the Town, with whom she was very free, before and afterwards.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Taken word for word from her own Mouth.</HEAD>
<P>THE first time Mr. <HI>Rogers</HI> came to see me; after much other Dis∣course, he told me of the odiousness of Sin; and that if ever I came to be sen∣sible of it, I should loath it, and not be∣cause of my own punishment procured thereby, but because of the Dishonour done to God. Then after he was gone, I began to think that I never loathed Sin so as yet, and was in a dreadful Case indeed; to think what a wretched Con∣dition I had brought my self into, and had dishonoured God: insomuch that I
<PB N="126" REF="001020_0138_0FAEE9A2C4967810"/>
could not Rest, I was so dreadfully hur∣ried; and Satan made me believe that it was impossible such a Sinner, should be Saved. And I could not Read, nor Sleep, nor have any Rest night nor day. After a while God made me to think that it was Satans Temptation to keep me from Repen∣tance: But if I could Repent and Be∣lieve in the Lord Jesus Christ, I might find mercy, although I was such a Sin∣ner. And although I am such a vile Sinner, I hope God has made me sensi∣ble of my sins, he has made me to loath my self, and truly to Repent for Sin. God has made me to see that there is nothing that I can do can save me, but that there is a sufficiency in the Lord Jesus Christ. And I do throw my self at his Feet for mercy, and have hope from his promises. <HI>Let the wicked for∣sake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him Return to the Lord, for he will have mercy on him: and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</HI> And I do so far as I know my self, Repent of my so great sins against so good a God; for that which has been the delight of

<P>During her Imprisonment (which was more than eight months) she was frequently visited by Ministers, and o∣ther Christians of the Town and Neigh∣bourhood, to whom she gave little En∣couragement for a considerable time, being very much reserved, partly thro' natural temper, partly by power of Temptation as was judged; that she could not open her mind or condition at all; nor make any other answer to Questions propounded, than yea or no: till after a while she obtained more free∣dom of spirit, and liberty of speech.

Then would she speak of her sins with aggravation, and express sorrow for them with great affection: related the distres∣sing, and almost despairing thoughts of her mind in the time that she kept si∣lence; as that God who had left her to fall so dreadfully into sin, would now leave her to an hard and impenitent heart, that she should be damned; found a great averseness at first, against going to the Publick Assembly on Sabbath and Lecture-Dayes, (for which she had li∣berty twice every week) lest her hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t should be more hardned, and her Con∣demnation more heightned thereby. But it was not long before she found a better fruit and effect of her attendance thereupon: She felt the power of the Word preached, inlightning, convin∣cing, humbling and softning of her heart. Also that the words spoken to her in private made deep and lasting impressi∣ons on her Soul: that she began to de∣light in hearing the Word publick or private; and set her self to search the Scriptures diligently, out of which she collected many Texts, that encouraged her to hope for mercy and pardon, as

And ha∣ving once laid hold on that Hope set before her in the Gospel; she did not, would not, ever after let it go; and tho' she could not so well express the reasons and grounds of her hope, as was desired, yet would not by any means be beaten off from it: and tho' sometim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s she felt a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>king fear come upon her, yet that did n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ong abide.

When News was carried to her, that her Life was likely to be prolonged near two months by the Courts Adjournment, it rais'd no sudden joy in her, as was ex∣pected: and though she could not but wonder at it her self, yet gave this rea∣son for it: I find (said she) a willing∣ness in me to accept the punishment of my sins, and a readiness to glorify the Justice of God by suffering that Death I have deserved, in hope of receiving his mercy to Eternal Life; but I submit to his pleasure. In the time of this Re∣prieval, she had many opportunities of going to the private Meetings of Chri∣stians in the Town, who spent whole days in Prayer with Fasting on her ac∣count; and though she joyned not in any Conference with them, yet profest her delight in hearing them, that she found much sweetness in their society, and de∣sired to be gathered with such at Death.</P>
