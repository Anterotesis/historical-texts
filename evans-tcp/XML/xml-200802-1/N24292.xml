<Q>Mr. Pope's maxim, that<LB/>
The proper study of mankind, is man.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>BEING fully and generally admitted, it necessarily follows, that well drawn character∣istic pictures of life, though fabulous, are a commendable and profitable branch of literary composition; as they prepare an attentive, in∣telligent reader for scenes of real action; and if the superstructure be raised from a moral foundation; without which, however beautiful the component parts, it must fall before the breath of rational criticism; then, while it de∣lights the imagination, it improves both the head and heart; a large majority, especially of the fair sex, have not time nor talents for the investigation of abstract principles in moral and social life; wherefore a lighter kind of study is essential; and even the greatest proselytes of pro∣found speculation, may unbend their minds, by perusal of a well pen'd novel, both with pleasure and advantage; several of this tendency might be pointed out, were they not already general∣ly known and acknowledged. It is true the Spanish novelists still remain unrivalled, for de∣licacy
<PB N="IV" REF="032122_0003_0FF138999BDBBE90"/>
of sentiment, and strength of character; but their pictures being, in general romantic caricatures; our lighter and fainter drafts have more original reality to recommend them;—though it is to be feared, that many authors, through necessity or avarice, exercise their pens for gain; and though we have too many instan∣ces, of wretches ready to propagate vice, for pecuniary advantage; yet, to the honour of the present age, it may be said, that no licentious piece, beyond a half penny ballad meets encou∣ragement: wherefore the worst charge that can be brought against productions of this nature, at present being trifling; so that there is little danger of prejudice, should there even be small hopes of improvement to the mind.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding professed critics launch their mortal darts at every production that is∣sues from the press, and generally attack the most helpless most unmercifully; the author of what follows, hopes, as he does not lay in any peculiar claim to striking merit; as he professes himself a young inexperienced ad∣venturer, warmly attached to moral rectitude, and more disposed to be grave in the cause of
<PB N="V" REF="032122_0004_0FF1389EC9EB1FA0"/>
virtue, than ludicrous at her expence; he hopes to gain protection from the ladies, and indul∣gence from those who examine the piece with a more critical eye: possessed of this flatter∣ing idea, he submits himself to public candor, without multiplying prefatory apologies, furth∣er than to premise, that he has not adhered to a strict dramatic catastrophe, which, if a defi∣ciency, he hopes, among others, will be excus∣ed, as he previously confesses, that some of his characters are introduced merely as foils to oth∣ers, without any design of disposing them ac∣cording to the rules of poetical justice.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SIR HENRY SUMMERS was a man by nature form∣ed sensible, open, and compassionate to the distresses of his fellow creatures, which he never looked on with∣out pitying, nor was pity all he bestowed; he too well knew the pain which that passion must give a feeling mind (when unaccompanied by assistance) ever to refuse his, to merit in distress. By art his natural sense was refined into wisdom, and his own generosity of sentiment gave him a humane politeness of behaviour, which gained him universal respect. By fortune he was blessed with an ample sufficiency to indulge eve∣ry benevolent wish of his expanded mind; luxurious or whimsical superfluity never rendered him incapable of assisting unhoused poverty. In short, he only regard∣ed his riches as they gave him an opportunity of con∣tributing to the support of deserving or necessitous objects.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="032122_0006_0FF138A6491BFC48"/>
While his character was respected even by those who were not personally acquainted with him, his be∣haviour created admiration and affection in all who were.</P>
<P>In friendship he was sincere, constant in danger, and patient in adversity, which he more than once had felt. To these qualifications he had joined the excel∣lent address of living (which is most hard to do) with∣out reproach. Yet, notwithstanding he was thus en∣dowed with every virtue that can truely form the ami∣able, generous, honest man; he had, in common with all human kind, his particularities; but they were such as rather to be the objects of applause than censure: His praises were too constant in the mouth of every one not to reach his own ear, and being well convinced of the solidity of his judgment, he expect∣ed a due deference to be paid thereto by all who had the least dependance on, or connexion with him; he had a pleasing dignity of countenance, which rend∣ered him at once the object of esteem and reverence; there was a little tincture of warmth and self-suffici∣ency in his disposition, which made him rather impa∣tient of controul: yet, after what I have said of this gentleman, there requires no great sagacity to disco∣ver, that what all allowed to be his virtues, far out∣weighed what some chose to call his faults.</P>
<P>Sir Harry, so early as eighteen, had contracted an acquaintance with a young lady of fortune, which, in a short time, grew into the most disinterested love; and
<PB N="3" REF="032122_0007_0FF138AA162E2578"/>
being a man of too much sensibility ever to think of her on any other than honourable terms, he consulted her father, who cruelly rejected his proposals, not from any dislike to his person, family, or fortune, which were all unexceptionable, but on account of his youth; partially imagining, that he could not be endowed with so much solidity, as to fix the volatile, wandering affections at so early a period of life, upon one object, however valuable; therefore consi∣dered his passion but as a flight of inconsiderate youth, which, in a short time after the accomplishment of his wishes, would naturally wear off: thus, through an over-refined degree of caution, the anxious father opposed the only step which could insure his daugh∣ter's happiness. Thus it often happens in life, that by earnestly endeavouring to avoid one error, we in∣evitably fall into its opposite.</P>
<P>This refusal, of course, put a stop to the frequent interviews with which the young couple had before found means to indulge themselves; yet, notwith∣standing it deprived them of the few sweet minutes personal conferences afforded, they, lover like, in∣dustriously found means to hear constantly from each other; two of which letters I here present to my readers. The first, which is from Sir Harry, was wrote the day after he received the refusal from her father.</P>

<HEAD>Sir HARRY SUMMERS to Miss AMELIA.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT words, most dear Amelia, can express my feelings at this juncture? Why should I inform you of what (I fear) you must already have heard—the reception I yesterday met with from your father? He ordered me to forget you. Oh! my AEmily, think what a person, who loves like me, must feel at such a sentence: but, thank heaven I have still one gleam of comfort to support my drooping spirits; I can not think you ever will be induced to join in such cruelty. In that fond hope alone I live, after the re∣peated assurances of regard I have received from my dearest AEmmy, I should be unworthy the smallest glimmering of respect where I to suppose that a sepa∣ration like this, can alter her generous, tender way of thinking. Yet, though I am fully conscious of your flattering sentiments, allow me to feel.—Your own delicate mind will do me the justice to suggest, how far a thought of losing you must affect me: let me avoid it, lest I sink beneath a painful weight of appre∣hension.—Yet, can I be thus divided from you, and loose the thought of what I should feel from an eter∣nal
<PB N="5" REF="032122_0009_0FF138AECA25DEB0"/>
separation?—Forgive me, if I cannot force it from my mind: admit my fears as a proof of my re∣gard: but I wrong you to think you'll look upon them in any other light than as the unavoidable pal∣pitation of a heart which loves you to distraction.—Alas! why did I ever experience the happy moments we've spent together, since they now only serve to make my misery the more severe?—May you not feel this parting as I do!—Whatever is my lot, may you for ever taste felicity;—I once indeed flattered my∣self, that I should have been in some measure condu∣cive thereto; that by my attention to your wants, and constant assiduity to please, I should have made myself worthy of the heart which I hoped would have given me your hand, and thereby tendered your hap∣piness complete.—Oh! what a delightful situation, when we have the pleasing consideration, that every action of our lives adds to the felicity of those we love!—From this thought there arises an unwearied reciprocal desire to please, which turns even the common occurrences of life, into proofs of a sincere and permanent regard. How much more delight do we feel, than those whose breasts are not susceptible of so delicate a refinement? This, my AEmily, is a situation I once hoped to have reached; but alas! why do I think thereof, since it can now afford but a momentary satisfaction, and only serve to make me return to the prospect before me with more reluctant regret—a prospect that I cannot think or look on with∣out shuddering?—Forgive me for saving, that under

<P>ACCORDING to a maxim of the kindest mother, [for such I was once blessed with] acknowledging a generous, disinterested passion for a deserving object, is most minutely consistent with delicate modesty; where I shall make no scruple of confessing, that your letter has raised very contrary feelings. Your pro∣fessions of love are flattering, but your doubts rather otherwise. The concessions your tender solicitations drew from me before our present disagreeable sepa∣ration I shall ever adhere to, even though a father's unreasonable displeasure should be the consequence. Let this undisguised effusion of an artless heart quiet those uneasy sensations which too plainly appear in your letter. Once more rest assured of sincerity on my side, as a return for your obliging wishes and in∣clinations to promote and secure my happiness. I could dwell much longer on the pleasing theme of mutual regard and sincerity, but that a parent's harsh commands intrude, and hurry me to a conclusion, with this assurance, that I am, with inviolable attach∣ment, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>

<P>MANY more letters passed between Sir Harry and his AEmily; but as most of them only contained the same assurances of regard in other words, and as love letters, no more than love scenes, are amusing to any but the parties concerned, I shall not trouble my readers with any more than these two, which may serve as a specimen of the stile and contents of all the others. Let it suffice to say, that Sir Harry having made another application to her father, and having received the same refusal, our lovers determined to make a stolen match; which being effected, Sir Har∣ry would have thrown himself at his wife's father's feet, but the old gentleman absolutely refused to see either of them, taking this imprudent step too nearly to heart, it in a short time finished his days; nor could he ever be prevailed upon to see his daughter, but ob∣stinately carried his resentment to the grave, as a proof of which, he bequeathed all he was worth to a distant relation of his wife's. This accident happening when Lady Summers was pregnant, a miscarriage was the consequence, followed by a violent fever, which in a few days put an end to her life: and thus
<PB N="8" REF="032122_0012_0FF138B78B380648"/>
was Sir Harry left a widower at the age of twenty-two, as a mourning monument of the fatal effects of filial disobedience.</P>
<P>So quick and so impressing a series of misfortunes cast a gloom upon his countenance, which it was not in the power of time to remove, any more than the settled resolution he made, on his wife's death, of never entering again into that state, wherein he had been so unlucky in his first attempt. He there∣fore lived, as I before said, the object of every one's admiration and esteem, striving to do all the good in his power. He partook of all the pleasures of life, without running into any of the absurdities; he was more delighted with amusements he met with at his seat in Yorkshire, as being the more rational, yet when in town, as he was half the year, he frequent∣ed every public place of diversion, to avoid the char∣acter of a misanthrope, which, from his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ettled me∣lancholy, some few officious people had chose to honour him with. He was about the age of forty, when the following affair happened.</P>
<P>Early one morning in February, when on his re∣turn from Carlisle-House, he was surprized by seeing a croud of watchmen round his door, occasioned, as he discovered on enquiry, by a basket just then picked up, which, to his great astonishment, was found to contain a female child, of (seemingly) about a month old. On his nearer approach, he observed
<PB N="9" REF="032122_0013_0FF138BE4A688918"/>
a paper pinned to its breast, on which were wrote, in a neat Italian hand, these words:</P>
<P><HI>"Stranger, whosoe'er thou art, that find'st this luckless babe, shut not your ears against the tender cries of youthful innocence, but pity, cherish, and re∣ceive her; in return for which she will far o'erpay your generous care by her endearing prattle."</HI></P>
<P>This was so forcible an application to the humani∣ty of Sir Harry (than whom no man had a greater share) that he could not withstand the natural im∣pulse of his heart, but ordered the child to be con∣veyed into his house, and to have all immediate care taken of it.—Thus to a heart so susceptible of tender∣ness, these few words pleaded the cause of this help∣less infant, in full as effectual a manner, and perhaps with more success, than whole volumes on the sub∣ject, from the ablest hands, could have done.</P>
<P>So singular an adventure employed Sir Harry's thoughts great part of that time which he would otherwise have appropriated to rest; but this cir∣cumstance, the more he considered it, the more it bewildered his ideas; in short, it was an endless maze of perplexities. He could not believe those lines to be the produce of any common hand, either from the stile or writing, nor did he know any one on whom to fix his suspicions: however, after some hesitation he yielded fully to the humane dictates of
<PB N="10" REF="032122_0014_0FF138C0F63C8580"/>
his heart, by resolving to furnish the child with every necessary, and, as she turned out, to fix her in the world. This resolution afforded him the tacit praise of what he had determined; nor was he a little strengthened in his design by the affecting smiles which sat upon the infant's countenance, when he went to inquire after it, and give orders for her nur∣sery. He was just sat down to breakfast, when Mr. Modish entered the room, to inquire after the com∣pany he had seen at Carlisle-house the preceeding evening.</P>

<P>MR. Modish was a gentleman of fortune, by na∣ture endowed with a good understanding, but unhap∣pily much over-run with the weed of inattention.—He was a distant relation to Sir Harry's who having a real regard for him, with pain observed the ridicu∣lous circumstances of his behaviour, which he al∣ways, like a true friend, endeavoured to amend by admonishment, wherever he saw occasion. Sir Har∣ry's mind was so full of the last night's adventure, that the first compliments were scarce passed, when be told the whole affair to Modish, who having heard him to the end with great attention, taking his hand with a triumphant laugh. replied:—"Sir Harry, I
<PB N="11" REF="032122_0015_0FF138C2AB684248"/>
give you joy. 'Egad, I'm glad to see any honest fel∣low, who has spirit enough to acknowledge his gal∣lantry. I really began to fear, we were all reverting to the antideluvian state, when an amour was looked upon as a crime. You know, I in particular was never fond of those primaeval notions, and always thought you rather too much addicted to them.—Well! and pray—Now, what happy girl has had the honour of converting you to my way of thinking? What—it is a secret, I suppose.—She bid you not kiss and tell, ha! Sir Harry?—'G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, I began to give you up for an obstinate heretic, in whom it was impossible to work a reformation. Well—I sup∣pose it is to be sent to nurse in the country to a ten∣ant's wife, who was formerly your house-keeper; and when he is about twelve years old, brought to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>own as the son of a poor clergyman, for whom you have a great regard; then a few years schooling, and a cornetcy in the guards, finishes the whole affair.—Well, upon my soul! you are a happy fellow, who have no check upon your pleasures from a deficiency in your purse."—This gentleman's volubility of tongue was so great, that Sir Harry was obliged to let him run on thus far, before he could convince him of his mistake with regard to the sex of the child, and which he had before forgot to inform him of;—but when he heard it was a girl, after near a min∣ute's pause, he cried,—"A girl! that's unlucky; however, we must make the best of a bad bargain.—
<PB N="12" REF="032122_0016_0FF138C4EF5C2D10"/>
Why, she must of course, be nursed in the country; and then bring her to London as your ward, the on∣ly daughter of a particular friend who died in the West Indies:—ay, ay, that will do:—and then a couple of thousand pounds, or so, may make her the wife of some honest citizen, who has more mo∣ney than wit."—In vain did he protest the child was not his own: Modish could not believe, that any man would thus adopt a perfect stranger to him: however, on Sir Harry's firm protestations, he be∣gan to have rather a different opinion:—Well, (says he) if the child is not your's, I think you did wrong to take any notice a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> her.—For my own part, it is a settled rule with me, to provide for no man's off∣spring but my own, and not even them at all times." "For shame, for shame! (cried Sir Harry, not a lit∣tle nettled at his relation's dissolute sentiments) I am sorry to see a man, to whom nature has been bounti∣ful both in understanding and fortune, make so bad an use of either, as to be directed, in the perform∣ance of the moral duties of life, by that fashionable folly, that plea, for the commission of every crime, Custom. Charles you know I'm your friend, and 'tis my friendship tells you, that however you may have been taught to believe otherwise by the company you kept, yet be assured, upon the word of a man who has seen and knows the world, that chastity is as noble a qualification in our sex as in the female, though, to our shame be it spoken, in the present age it seems
<PB N="13" REF="032122_0017_0FF138CB55537CE8"/>
totally excluded from the catalogue of male virtues; nor indeed can I hardly blame our youths for a breach thereof, not only because they have never been taught to consider it in the light of a crime, but because they have no incitement thereto from the only part of the creation, they naturally expect it from, I mean, that class of females distinguished by the appellation of modest women; a tender union with whom, in some part or other of our lives, we all esteem as our ne plus ultra; and want of chasti∣ty being no impediment to such an alliance, we con∣sequently are not so solicitous about possessing this virtue as we otherwise should be: for let a man commit every folly, every vice, which youth, in∣temperance, or his impassioned inclinations prompt him to, and he will never feel the consequences from those who, by the coolness of their behaviour, ought to express their dislike of such proceedings. On the contrary, amours with a variety of women give a man an air of greater consequence, and more probability of success with the rest of the sex. Can any thing be a stronger proof of the truth of this as∣sertion, than that proverbial expression which we so constantly hear come from the mouths of females of every rank, and of the truth of which they seem all to be so well convinced, <ABBR>viz,</ABBR> That a reformed rake makes the best husband. In short, young gentle∣men, whatever fashion or depraved appetites may dictate, spirit with prudence, and love with virtuous constancy, are the sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at anchors of moral and social
<PB N="14" REF="032122_0018_0FF138CE2ABB9EF8"/>
happiness."—Bravo! (cried Modish, after a short silence) pray, proceed:—upon my word, Sir Harry, you have harangued with the gravity of a bishop: so you mean, by this fine, grave, sentimental oration, to make me believe, that this girl is not your own. But pray, my dear Summers, joking apart, do you really look upon keeping a mistress in the light of a crime?"—"Sir (said Sir Harry, frowning, much amazed) I am obliged to go out at present, on some particular business: if you will favour me with your company to dinner, by four, at the Thatch'd House. I may perhaps tell you some more of my thoughts on this subject."—"Agreed, said he, though upon my soul! I am engaged to meet Lord Squander, Billy Rattle, and some others, to dinner, at the Shakespear, from thence to proceed in battle array to assist at the damnation of a new comedy; but you are such a holy witch, as the poor poet says, that you enchant society to you, and I have really now kept your company so long, that I begin to find more so∣lid pleasure in hearing your rational discourse, than in the noisy mirth of my bottle companions: I will therefore wait upon you, though, by so doing, I shall disoblige some of the honestest fellows, except your∣self in the universe."—"For which, replied Sir Harry, I shall not be sorry. But pray, have you read this new play, which you thus intended to have strangled in the birth?"—"Not I, upon, my soul! said he; I don't even know the author.—"And how could you, rejoined his friend, be cruel enough, for
<PB N="15" REF="032122_0019_0FF138D166FE0670"/>
the sake of a few minutes diversion, perhaps to ruin a man, whose only prospects may depend on the suc∣cess of this night's piece; even before you can know, whether it is deserving of your censure or applause?"—"Nay, that replied Modish, is considering it in too serious a light. I never troubled my head about its merit; but it would be making a riot, which is my delight. But adieu till four."—And thus they parted; Sir Harry, to go about the business he had mentioned, and Modish, to take his usual turn in the Mall; after which, he met his friend, according to appointment, and had the pleasure of hearing his farther thoughts on the subject they had that morning started: but as the particulars of their conversation never came to my knowledge, and were, I presume, similar to those already mentioned, let it suffice to say, that Sir Harry, in consequence of the conversa∣tion, was more confirmed in the principles of human∣ity and protection to his ward, or rather adopted daughter. He went home, his mind replete with those pleasing sensations, of which no one can be a competent judge, whose soul is not equally expand∣ed, equally succeptible of delicate ideas.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE consequence of the conversation which Sir Harry had with Modish, as related in the last chap∣ter, was an immediate application of his time to the preparation of every thing which might conduce to the ease and happiness of his adopted child, whom he now determined to educate in London, that he might not seem to pay any attention to the many ill-natured insinuations which he constantly heard, and still expected to hear, about so extraordinary an af∣fair, from the major part of the world. However, equally regardless of their censure or their praise, he still nobly persevered in the execution of his first de∣sign, with regard to the education of that child, whom in memory of his once dear partner, he had christened by the name of AEmily, and who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e benig∣nant smiles, whenever he approached, he considered as so many grateful returns for his humanity, in the preservation of her life.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="032122_0021_0FF138DA90321288"/>
As soon as her tender mind was adjudged capable of retaining any impressions, he prepared masters to instruct her in every thing suiting her age and sex, which she took fast as 'twas minister'd; and he had soon the satisfaction of hearing her, in unaffected strains, express her thanks for the many favours he daily bestowed on her, and which never failed to put him in mind of those remarkable words, which the reader may remember were found upon her breast. He was in some doubt whether to acquaint her with this circumstance or not; but judging that a discov∣ery of that nature might, from the generosity and laudable pride of her mind, when she considered herself as an object of charity, occasion a reserve in her behaviour, which would deprive him of the pleasure of her open and ingenious conversation, he chose, rather than run this hazard, to impose upon her by an information that she was his niece; and as he always made a distinction between a falsity, con∣trived with a premeditated design to do an injury, and one with an innocent intention, he had on this occasion no other feelings, than those which con∣scious virtue always experiences on the performance of any good action. However that she might not always remain a stranger to what so nearly concern∣ed her, he wrote an account thereof, which with the paper abovementioned, being inclosed in his will, were committed into the hands of his attorney.</P>
<P>AEmily was now endowed with a person far from contemptible; but having affairs of much more con∣sequence
<PB N="18" REF="032122_0022_0FF138DD8CAE5A68"/>
to take notice of, I shall not detain my read∣ers with a minute account of those qualifications which can reflect no honour on her noble parts, be∣ing qualifications, if they deserve that name, which every woman is equally liable to possess in as emminent a degree as herself; but to her honour be it spoken, that, added to ageeable external endow∣ments, she had a mind replete with every amiable virtue.</P>
<P>Sir Harry now considering her in every respect as his niece, accompanied her to all places of public entertainment; but she was far too sensible, to re∣ceive any solid satisfaction from the enjoyment of any of the present modish diversions, except the The∣atre, which she considered as not only proper for refining our sentiments and ideas, but as the most luxurious treat the human understanding is capable of enjoying. No wonder then, that she was an al∣most constant attendant there, especially when per∣formances of an edifying cast were exhibited.</P>
<P>The residence of her uncle (that being the light in which she now considered Sir Harry) in Yorkshire, during the summer season, to which place she always accompanied him, gave her a full opportunity of pur∣suing her favourite amusements, reading and walk∣ing; in the latter of which she found an additional pleasure, being generally accompanied by a neigh∣bouring young lady, for whom she had the sincerest
<PB N="19" REF="032122_0023_0FF138DF382EB0C0"/>
affection that a similarity of sentiment could promote; nor was her generous friendship placed on an unde∣serving object; she had the happiness of having it returned with additional ardor. To this young la∣dy, who was the daughter of Sir Thomas Hartry, AEmily opened her whole heart, on every occasion, with all the ingenuity of disinterested regard. She had just attained her twentieth year, when an affair, which the reader will soon become acquainted with gave rise to the following letters from AEmily to her friend.</P>

<P>NOTHING but a thorough conviction of my dear friend's good-nature, and too great know∣ledge of the mutability of our sex, to rally me upon my sudden change, could have induced me to trouble her with this letter.—Oh! my Maria! must I confess to you, that with all my boasted indifference, I at length am caught? at least I think so; and so will

you, when I acknowledge, that I am afraid to ask my heart the question.—However secure of your friendly council in this untried scene, I will venture to com∣municate the circumstances as they happened.</P>
<P>The appearance of Garrick in tragedy, some time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, induced my uncle, at my request, to take places <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that evening; and although he was indisposed all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> morning with a violent head-ache <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in spite of my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>monstrances insisted on performing his promise, by attending me to the play in the evening; so far does <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is good man, in every thing, prefer my happiness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his own ease. As it was a crouded night, we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not to stay the farce, and ordered the carriage accordingly. We had not been long seated in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ox, before Miss Martin, with whom I have a slight acquaintance, seated herself behind us being attended by her brother, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> young gentleman of small private fortune, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his winter been called to the bar, where he promises fair to make a figure: but although no one applies more closely to his profession, when out of it, he is quite the gentleman, which character very few know, how so well to unite with the man of business. Finding I was no stranger to his sister, from his first entrance, he directed his conversation parti∣cularly to me; but being the only woman in compa∣ny, except her (and sisters, you know, are nobody) I only thought it what every man would have done in the same case, and therefore, at that time, consider∣ed
<PB N="21" REF="032122_0025_0FF138E82FAB8590"/>
it in no other light than as common civility. Our discourse naturally turning upon the exhibition be∣fore us, the justice of his remarks added to the appa∣rent diffidence with which they were uttered, gave me as high an opinion of his judgment as I had of his address and personal behaviour. Added to these, he is furnished with a mind susceptible of the most delicate feelings; for, would you think it, my dear? he was even unfashionable enough to weep at the imaginary representation of distress: as if ashamed of his weakness, he for some time endeavoured to con∣ceal the emotions of his foul; but in vain: nature got the better of art, and shewed the unaffected good∣ness of his heart in its true colours. I do not know whether it was from sympathy, but I never was more affected at a tragedy in my life: he perceived it, and I had the satisfaction of being complimented by him on the tenderness of my passions. Surely this man knows my very thoughts, for he did not once seem to pay the least attention to my person: if he has any design upon my affections, this is his only way. Your Emmy would hold that man unworthy a place in her heart, who could be captivated by her person only; such love can have no stability; every day will shew new beauties to his eyes, each of whom will blot the remembrance of the former from his heart; and thus admiring all, he really regards none. But a man, who prefers us for some superior excellence of mind, will, when in possession of our persons, have daily opportunities of seeing the improvement of the for∣mer:
<PB N="22" REF="032122_0026_0FF138EB4F3D8128"/>
and thus with love and reason both combined, we spread a toil too dear for him to break. How cau∣tious, then, how very cautious should we be, not to fix our affections on a man, who probably may abuse the confidence we place in him. When the indisso∣luble knot is tied, we are no longer preserved under the fostering wing of an indulgent parent, friends and relations, all give up the joint care they have had of our happiness, and center it alone in the will of a husband: to him we must on all occasions fly for as∣sistance, which if he refuses, we indeed are miserable.</P>
<P>And yet, my Maria, what hazard, what risque, do we not run, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he choice of that man, who is to preside over every future action of our lives? for there are a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of men, who think women made but for their pleasure, as a domestic convenience, to rise at their smiles, or fink at their rebuke; and then, after such behaviour, are amazed to find the delights of matri∣mony do not answer the expectations they have been taught to conceive thereof, and begin to treat every idea of connubial love as merely chimerical, no where existing but in the luxuriant fancy of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ingenuous to create imaginary pleasures: thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣culing the height of human felicity, only because it is a refinement of which their coarser ideas are not susceptible. From such, kind heaven defend my friend and me!</P>
<P>Although I am not guided by a blind mistake<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> partiality for my own sex, yet I acknowledge my∣self
<PB N="23" REF="032122_0027_0FF138F0008506B0"/>

<P>Do not, from what I have above said, imagine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I am mad enough to think, there is nothing requi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of us in this arduous state; so far from it, I am con∣vinced that, were we to spend our whole lives in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> consideration of what is proper to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> there would still be something wanting in our con∣duct to supply every duty incumbent on a good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; and this very circumstance seems designed by provi∣dence, to augment our felicity! for if there were faults, we should loose all that heart-felt satisfaction arising from a reciprocal forgivement thereof. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> all let us remember, that we should retain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> after we become the wife, and not, when commence the one, entirely divest ourselves of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> other; for if we do, how wide will be the difference<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>?—where that amiable, engaging compliance, we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> use of to appear agreeable before marriage? and we did it then only perhaps to satisfy a girlish-vani<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> how much more studiously ought we to use <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

<P>But my zeal for the happiness of the rest of my sex, has almost made me forget to proceed in my story.</P>
<P>At the conclusion of the play, my uncle went out to enquire after the carriage, promising to return immediately: but after having waited some time, you may imagine how amazed I was to see nothing of him, nor could I help expressing my astonishment thereat to Miss Martin, who as well as her brother, strove with all the tender concern they could to quiet my fears; but in vain. During the whole time of the entertainment, I was agitated with the most dreadful apprehensions, insomuch that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had dropt sometime before I discovered it.—In this dilemma, Mr. Martin insisted on setting me down, which, in such a situation, I could not refuse; he therefore handed me into the passage, where the croud was too great for us to proceed, and his eager∣ness
<PB N="25" REF="032122_0029_0FF138F4EF251780"/>
to extricate us from this difficulty led him so far, that by some accident, a chairman in shifting one of his poles let it fall upon his head, from whence the blood immediately gushed in a great quantity. You may more easily imagine, than I can describe, the consternation this threw both his sister and me into, our fears interpreting the danger to be greater than it really was, which, he assured us, was very trifling, and notwithstanding our most earnest entrea∣ties, could not be prevailed on to accept of any assist∣ance till he got home: but turning to his sister, de∣sired she would lend him her handkerchief, somebo∣dy in the croud having been civil enough to borrow his; but I being the quicker of the two (and, I am afraid, almost as much concerned for his safety) be∣fore she could find her's, had offered him mine, which he politely accepted; and having bound it round his head, with some difficulty seated us in the coach.</P>
<P>On our arrival at Albermarle-street, I enquired after my uncle, and had the satisfaction of hearing that he had been taken ill, on the sudden change from so intense heat to cold; but that, to my heart∣felt ease, he was again recovered, and had arrived just before me. On hearing this, Mr. Martin beg∣ged leave to enquire after his health, the next day: which I could not refuse, but desired that he would not, out of complaisance to enquire after the safety of others endanger his own, by coming out too soon; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="26" REF="032122_0030_0FF138FB5D644AC0"/>
and intreated he would let me know how he did in the morning; which having promised, they took their leave, and left me at liberty to visit my uncle, who, I found had no remains of his disorder but a violent head-ach.</P>
<P>Mercy on me! to what an unconscionable length have I extended this subject! but we are apt to dwell on pleasing themes, without considering the leisure or patience of a correspondent. However, I think it is now high time for me to conclude, with an as∣surance of your soon hearing from me again; and that however I may be employed in the delightful task of duty and of love, there will always be room left for my Maria, in the heart of her sincerest friend,</P>

<P>AGREEABLE to my promise, I again take up my pen, to proceed in what your vivacity will call a romantic adventure. After parting with Mr. Mar∣tin, I went to bed, but without inclination to sleep. The composure I had always hitherto felt, on repair∣ing to rest, was gone, and in its room had left ten thousand doubts and fears.—According to my cust∣om, upon a strict examination into my actions of the day, I found in my heart sensations which I dared not give way to, nor could totally suppress: in short, I found my happiness depended on the actions of a man who never (and what was worse) who perhaps never intended to speak to me on any other footing than that of a common acquaintance. Shall I confess to you, that this thought affected me so far as to hinder me from taking my natural rest? I therefore rose i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the morning, pale, and unrefreshed, my usual spright∣liness
<PB N="28" REF="032122_0032_0FF138FF099C5B90"/>
supplanted by a melancholy dejection, almost too much for me to bear. My uncle perceived it, and with a paternal kindness, tenderly enquired the cause. To acknowledge the real one was impossi∣ble the fictitious confession of having been troubled with the toothach all night, delivered me from that confusion which his question had thrown me into; but you may imagine that I did not feel much easier, when after a moment's recollection, my conscience dictated to me, to what the entertainment of an im∣prudent passion had reduced your friend; the wilful deception of a man so kind, so generous, that hither∣to he had always strove to intercept my wishes, that I might never know what it was to ask a favour.—Oh! my Maria!—to what does this love subject us! how far does it debase the generosity of our minds beneath its glorious sphere!—At our births, by na∣ture we are open, ingenuous, and sincere; our youth∣ful hearts can entertain no thought, no wish, which we desire to exclude the breast of any one acquaint∣ance.</P>
<P>I was meditating on the fallacious influence of un∣authorized concealed love, when, according to my expectation, the servant announced Mr. Martins approach. This sound at once roused me from my reveries, and gave me spirits to receive him in as dis∣engaged a manner as the nature of our acquaintance would admit of. I was sorry to observe, that his
<PB N="29" REF="032122_0033_0FF13901DD2FF068"/>
dress (considering the time of day) was studiously elegant. I am afraid he has either too much of the coxcomb in him, or a worse opinion of my under∣standing than I could wish; as his appearance seemed to indicate, that he thinks me capable of receiving an impression from his exterior parts. From your thorough knowledge of my heart, you best can tell how much he is mistaken: and here, methinks you will call me a whimsical girl, for troubling my head so much about a man, whom as yet I had never seen but once.—Why, that indeed is very true; but in that once, his eyes as plainly spoke the language of his soul, as if he had told me that he loved; for, in his whole behaviour, there was a delicate attention to my every word, which was more persuasive elo∣quence than any he could use.</P>
<P>Some few compliments had passed between us, when my uncle entered the room, to whom I intro∣duced Mr. Martin, as the gentleman to whom I was so much obliged for his assistance the preceeding evening. With his usual politeness, he made him many acknowledgments for his behaviour, and in a short time, insensibly fell into a conversation, which seemed to promise an intimacy; nor was I mistaken in my conjectures; a general invitation to Alber∣marle-street was the consequence, at which I will confess, I was not a little pleased; and, in order to strengthen this growing connexion, I sent by him a message to his sister, intimating that I should be
<PB N="30" REF="032122_0034_0FF1390787429CB0"/>
proud of a stricter acquaintance with her: after which he took his leave, not without first having made a very significant bow to me;—at least my va∣nity construed it as such.</P>
<P>You may imagine he did not neglect the invita∣tion he had received: few days passed in which we did not see him; and my uncle in a short time con∣ceived so cordial a fondness for him, that he scarce∣ly ever seemed to have enough of his company; he was one in all our parties at home, and a tended us to every public place; and though he did not pay me the common compliments which most of his sex use to our's, still there was a certain delicacy in ev∣ery <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which too plainly assured me, that he re∣garded me with other eyes than those of a more ac∣quaintance: and I will acknowledge, that I daily ex∣pected a declaration of his passion, nay, that I even wish'd it, though I was not without my fears, lest my uncle, on account of the smallness of his fortune should oppose his inclinations, and thereby deprive me of his company, which I now enjoyed with un∣limited pleasure.—Oh! my Maria!—what did I not suffer from this apprehension!—and as he grew eve∣ry day more particular, every time I saw him increas∣ed my uneasiness, till at length, what I so long ex∣pected, arrived: but I am summoned to my toilet, and therefore must make this the subject of another <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.

<P>WHEN once affection is rooted in the breast, hard is the task to conceal the movements of our hearts from the dear object. I thus, my amiable friend, begin with a sentiment, because I think the sequel of my story will pretty clearly exemplify it: I will therefore now resume the thread of my dis∣course, and endeavour to be a little more consistent than in my last; but as I was at that time in an unu∣sual flutter of spirits, I am sure you will pardon me.</P>
<P>The morning preceding to my writing it, I was lolling negligently on a settee, perusing your letter, when Mr. Martin, entering the room suddenly, un∣heard and unexpected, threw me into some lit∣tle confusion, and in my hurry I dropt your epistle on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which if you remember, was directed by your father: he immediately picked it up, and
<PB N="32" REF="032122_0036_0FF1390E2268AF70"/>
perceived the superscription to be a man's hand: after a short silence, during which various passions by turns appeared in his face. "How happy, Mad∣am, said he, must that gentleman be, who can so far have acquired your esteem, as to be permitted to correspond with you!"—Having so said, he held it in his hand, as if waiting for an answer; but as I perceived a taint of jealousy in his words and mode of expression, I endeavoured to evade the circum∣stance, by enquiring when I might hope to congratu∣late him upon a perfect recovery of the accident he met at the Theatre, which still clouded his counte∣nance with a patch? Seeing through my artifice, he answered as follows; "You seem, Miss Summers, to be extremely cautious of saying any thing further on the letter:"—and, with a kind of forced irony, added, "I am sure Miss Summer's principles would never suffer her to hold a correspondence with any one of whom she need be ashamed."—Notwith∣standing the satisfaction I at that moment felt for hav∣ing awakened the resentment of that love I wished to cultivate, to support the farce, I could not avoid replying, with an air of negligence, "I do not think myself obliged to consult all my acquaintance on the choice of my correspondents; and provided I have none with whom my uncle is displeased, I do not see that any other person has any concern in the af∣fair."—Poor soul! how engagingly simple he look∣ed!
<PB N="33" REF="032122_0037_0FF13911E83BC630"/>
—he hung his head, and with a timid hesitating inferiority, said, "To be sure, Madam—as you say—I have no right—I once, indeed, added he with a sigh, flattered myself—but fool that I was—what reason had I to expect"—then with a low bow con∣tinued, "as I acknowledge my transgression, and sincerely beg your pardon, I hope Miss Summers will for once excuse so impertinent a curiosity;—especially as in palliation thereof, I can with truth assure her, that I had some reason for my seeming enquiry."—Well, said I, since you confess your fault, I will now convince you, that your suspicions were groundless;—but observe—I do this to justify myself, not to satisfy you."—So saying, I produced the letter, and relating to him the real truth, shewed him your name, at the sight of which, his countenance immediately brightened up; and I will own to you that I felt an unspeakable pleasure, when I saw him under a pretence of a closer examination of the direction, press my name to his lips with the greatest eagerness; after which he returned me the letter, with as much composure as if he was con∣vinced I had not taken notice of his last action.</P>
<P>The conversation now dropp'd; but this being far from my intention [I am afraid out of the secret desire of urging him to a declaration] immediately took an opportunity of saying, "I think Sir you told me, that you had a reason for your seeming enquiry concerning the letter; shall I not come under the
<PB N="34" REF="032122_0038_0FF1391532409020"/>
predicament of unreasonable curiosity by desiring to know what it was?"—"By no means, replied he, as you are the only person interested in it, you have an undoubted right to be acquainted therewith;—pardon me then; dear Miss Summers, but my own happiness was at stake."—"Nay, now said I, I don't understand you."—"Say rather, reply'd he, with some emotion, you will not understand me, and in∣deed I do not know whether I should wish you to, nor would I ever have informed you of it, but that I find, notwithstanding all my endeavours' it will be impossible long to conceal it from you; in justifica∣tion therefore of my own behaviour (which I am sensible must have appeared very extraordi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry) am under an absolute necessity of declaring, that from the first moment which I saw I lov'd you."—Oh, my Maria!—what contradictory creatures are we women?—although this declaration was my ul∣timate wish, and though it was what I had so long expected, would you believe, that when the wish'd, for moment was arrived, I could scarce support my∣self from fainting. Perceiving therefore that I hesi∣tated for an answer (for indeed I knew not what to say, he took one of my hands and with some warmth cry'd, "May I not dearest Miss Summers, hope that by my earnest endeavours to please, I may at length render myself not totally disagreeable to you."—And much more he then said than I can now remember: it is impossible to describe the dilemma I was in; and to confess the truth, the moment was not a little cri∣tical.
<PB N="35" REF="032122_0039_0FF139170C34ADF8"/>
—A fine young fellow at my feet, using all the rhetoric he was master of, to persuade me to what before I had no small inclination (I mean the avow∣al of my passion) was a dangerous situation:—Tell me, my Maria, was this a time for hesitation?—Trust me—No—And I really think that I had great prudence in avoiding a present return of his profes∣sions; which I did by saying, "It has always been my constant rule, and always shall be, Sir, never to listen to any one on this subject, till I have my un∣cle's sanction for so doing; it is to him therefore you must apply."—"By your referring me to Sir Harry, madam (replied he) I flatter myself that if I have his permission for the attempt, I may one day inspire you with sentiments of tenderness."—Was not that pretty forward my dear?—However I was determined to punish him for his presumption; therefore with all the consequence I could then as∣sume, I replied, "You have drawn, Sir, a conclusion in your own favour which might as easily be turn'd to your disadvantage; I mean, that you might take my reference of you to my uncle for an absolute de∣nial; as I think, you may be pretty well convinced, that he will never be induced to give you his con∣sent."—"I understand you, Madam, said he, the difference of our fortunes and expectations; but I have too good an opinion of your generosity to think that alone could influence you, whatever it might Sir Harry; for which reason I rather chose to ap∣ply
<PB N="36" REF="032122_0040_0FF1391A4DEE3538"/>
to you first, being convinced that were I to meet with encouragement from you, he would never with∣hold his, in a point where your happiness was so nearly concerned." My answer to this came of course, "Your only way, Sir, to gain mine is, to say no more on this subject, till after your application to him; however of this you may be assured, that as I am almost convinced he will never interpose in an affair of this kind, so have I too much honour to give any person a double trouble where one will suffice." Was this saying too much?—However, whether it was or not, be understood my meaning well; for kissing my hand with the greatest tender∣ness, "My kindest AEmily," burst spontaneously from his lips; and so he left me to follow my in∣structions with regard to my uncle.—And now my friend, I ask your advice how to act, in case he should oppose my wishes: as be that as it may, I am sure it will be impossible to hide the movements of my heart from him, who has gained so entire possession of it; but in your council, talk not of impossibilities; and if you have never felt the influence of a tender partiality, considering the difficulty of erasing one when it is firmly rooted in the heart.—Adieu, strain every power to assist with your advice,</P>

<P>OH! my Maria give me joy; I am happy, hap∣py beyond expression; he is mine, fast as the pow∣ers of love and promise can ensure him;—oh, the extatic minute when, after long restraint the hearts of lovers congenial spring to meet each other!—Sir Harry yesterday informed me, that he had received proposals from Mr. Martin, "of what nature (added he with a smile) I believe you are not ignorant; I therefore desire to know of you what answer I am to give him:"—"Your prudence, Sir, (said I) will al∣ways direct you to what is best."—"That's not the case (replied he) put prudence out of the question, then tell me, could you love him as a wife?—if you can, he is yours; and though your fortunes will not be large enough to supply the luxurious superfluities of life, it shall be made sufficient to render two wor∣thy people happy; and you still may have something to spare for the necessities of a deserving friend, or a pitiable object; and in this life what more can be desired?" In short, in the afternoon I received a visit from Mr. Martin, and my uncle joining our hands, expressed his approbation of the union; at the same time, with a benignant smile, imploring Heaven to shower down prosperity upon our heads. I was thus, you see, obliged to promise, that in due

<HEAD>MARIA to AEMILY.</HEAD>
<P>INDEED, indeed, my dearest AEmily, there's no bearing this: you are positively a horrid provoking girl: one minute you ask my advice, and the next comes a letter, informing me that you have followed your own inclination, without waiting for my coun∣sel: thus are all the fine things, which I had trea∣sured up to persuade you to conquer your passion, thrown away, and rendered useless, by your precipi∣tate conduct. Being determined to give you some assistance, as I cannot address myself to you after the manner I at first intended, I will endeavour to lay you down some rules for the married state, which I hope will not be totally useless.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="032122_0044_0FF139292BA57258"/>
Seriously then, as my AEmily has always hitherto dignified me with the name of Friend, I should ill deserve that title, were I to be silent at a time when all her acquaintances will soon be pouring in their congratulations, on what may justly be called, the most important event of our life. At a time like this, when your heart is replete with joy, I am afraid you will scarce have leisure to attend a tedious homi∣ly of grave sentiments. Sincerity is the truest test of friendship, and, though uncourtly, when well meant claims a favorable reception: the physician who administers medicines which may be disagreeable, and the surgeon who probes a wound, as they act upon salutary principles, ought rather to be thanked than blamed, for the essential pains their endeavours oc∣casion.</P>
<P>First then let me entreat you to consider seriously the solemn nature of the engagement into which you are going to enter; and as you have often, to feed a foolish vanity, spent whole days in choice of a new gown, or a set of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ibbands; how much more atten∣tively should you consider that general conduct, which is to ensure your happiness, or misery!</P>
<P>But as a preacher in petticoats is intolerable, though my pappa says there are many old women mount pulpits, I shall not endeavour to prejudice you against the matrimonial voyage you are about to take, by picturing the many hazards and perils which of∣ten attend it.—Be neat in apparel, cordial in beha∣viour,
<PB N="41" REF="032122_0045_0FF1392F5C7BBF80"/>
slow to find, and ready to forgive, faults;—cautious of hearing that dangerous flattery beauty like your's may produce; follow fashion, without worshiping so vain an idol; indulge agreeable, harm∣less society; preserve natural charms, by a regular life, without paltry aids of art; support spirit accor∣ding to your income, with that commendable oecon∣omy which casts at distance parsimonious penury;—in short, my dear AEmily, strive to make home agree∣able, and with the accomplishments you are mistress of, if your husband wanders, he must be the most ungrateful, insensible, or vicious wretch living.</P>
<P>That I may not interrupt that pleasing flow of ideas, and that lovely prospect of expectation, may they prove real and permanent, which now brighten your mind! Allow me to hasten a conclusion, and to wish that some remembrance of me may ever find some corner in my dear Emmy's delicate affection.</P>

<P>YOU cannot imagine, my dearest AEmily, how much your last letter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This letter does not appear.</NOTE> has surprised me; nor are you so explicit as I could wish: you only tell me, that an unexpected business requires your uncle's immediate attendance in Ireland, and that he has de∣sired you to postpone your marriage till after his re∣turn; thus leaving me to guess at all the other cir∣cumstances: however, I hope that his business, whatever it be, will not detain him long; and if so, I will fairly confess, that I am not sorry for it, for, two reasons; because to learn how to set a just value on prosperity, we should feel the frowns of disap∣pointment; so this slight misfortune will inure you to the patient toleration of greater, should they ever arrive: the other cause of my joy at this event is, that it will give me the pleasure of your company, as I must insist on having you at Oak Hall during your uncle's absence: bring Mr. Martin with you, and let us make a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtie <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; who the fourth per∣son is to be, I will inform you when I can do it in person.—Oh! my AEmily, I have much to say to you, more than I can possibly croud into the limits

<P>IN consequence of the foregoing Letter, AEmily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on set out for Oak-Hall; though not without some small regret, as Mr. Martin's attendance at West∣minster necessarily prevented him from accompany∣ing her; but as Maria will now begin to make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o small figure in this history, it might he right to give my readers some further account of this young lady, as well as of her parents: in order to do which pro∣perly, I must begin at an earlier period than that to which I have reduced my story.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas Hartry was a baronnet possessed of a large estate in the country where he resided; which he inherited from a long train of ancestors, who were all rendered remarkable by their extreme avarice: and though he did not possess this shocking con∣traction of heart in so great a degree, still he did not
<PB N="44" REF="032122_0048_0FF139390FD1E570"/>
totally degenerate from the maxim of his illustrious forefathers. "Get money," was his favourite prin∣ciple; and indeed this seemed to be the aim of all his actions; notwithstanding which, he was by no means totally callous to the feelings of humanity;—for, what was most extraordinary, he could feel for the distresses of others; though he seemed deaf to al∣most the common calls of necessity for himself. Ever constant to his favourite notions, he married lady Hartry for two reasons; the one, because she had ten thousand pounds; the other, in hopes of having an heir to his estate: and as this was almost his ulti∣mate wish, one would imagine he must be complete∣ly happy, to find himself indulged with such a bless∣ing, about a year after his marriage; and such a one who as he grew up, became the admiration of the whole country, for his sense and good nature; in short he seem'd entirely clear from his father's faults, and to inherit the virtues only of both his parents; yet such is the unaccountable caprice of human nature, that though he was so deserving a son, as almost to ex∣ceed description, he never was a favourite with his father; who, notwithstanding, could assign no reason for his dislike. Charles (that was his name) beheld it with concern, and endeavoured to gain his affec∣tions by his assiduity; but this, instead of being taken in the favourable light, served only to heighten his father's disgust: in short, nothing could please him, and he at last drove him, by a course of ill usage, at
<PB N="45" REF="032122_0049_0FF1393E59A6BA08"/>
the age of eighteen, to seek that happiness among his nearest relations. But behold the amazing caprice of mankind! who never knew how to set a just va∣lue on a jewel till 'tis gone; that we cannot know how much we love, or what it is to want a friend till we have lost him was never more strongly veri∣fied that in this instance of Sir Thomas Hartry; who till this moment, never was aware of the real affec∣tion which he had for his son; his virtues now ap∣peared with double force to the afflicted father, who in vain used all possible means to recover him; and when be found that he was gone for even, all the ten∣der parent rising into his eyes, quite absorb'd the man; and he for some time gave way to that soft sorrow which overpowered his breast, and which he could not suppress.</P>
<P>So severe a blow had nearly been too much for Lady Hartry, who almost doated on her son, regard∣ing him with those innate feelings which mothers only can be truly judges of. Time, however that great restorer of all things, in some measure allevi∣ated the grief of both Sir Thomas and his lady; the former of whom, with the loss of his son, seem∣ed totally to have abandoned his passion for money, and determined to make up in kindness what the son had wanted, to his daughter Maria, who being ten years old when the above affair happened, could not, of course be supposed to feel much affliction for the loss of her brother:—all that she could, she did.—
<PB N="46" REF="032122_0050_0FF139400947CF08"/>
As she might now be reckoned an only child, no trouble, no expence, was spared in the education of this darling of the family; and her fond parents were overjoyed to find their trouble and attention so well repaid, as to behold her, at the age of eighteen, pos∣sessed of every natural as well as acquired perfection, necessary to complete the accomplished lady: her person was handsome to excess, rather short than otherwise; her carriage was genteel and easy with∣out affectation;
<Q><L>Her breath disclos'd the sweets of spring</L>
<L>And if for summer you would seek,</L>
<L>'Twas painted in her eye, her cheek.</L></Q>
The goodness of her understanding has been made sufficiently apparent to the reader by her letter, be∣fore inserted, to AEmily on the subject of her mar∣riage. So happy in natural and acquired perfec∣tions, no wonder she was the delight of her parents, and the admiration of all who knew her.</P>

<BIBL>ROMEO and JULIET.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MARIA Hartry was proposed as a just pattern for all the young ladies in the country. No young man could see her without loving; nor was there any father but what courted, and would have been proud of her alliance. Yet, amidst the many admir∣ers that she gained, the many compliments which were paid her, and though surrounded by the whole artillery of love; no gallant could yet boast of hav∣ing received more encouragement from her than was becoming an acquaintance, for as such only did she regard all who had offered her their services: not∣withstanding which, as I profess myself to be a faith∣ful historian, I must confess, that she could not call her heart her own, it having long since, in her pri∣vate determination, been bestowed on a neighbouring gentleman, whose name was Melvill; though he was ignorant of his good fortune in the possession of so inestimable a treasure; not that he was blind to the united charms of person and understanding, which so apparently shone forth in Maria, but be∣cause his diffidence prevented him from assuring him∣self
<PB N="48" REF="032122_0052_0FF13944E5177FA8"/>
of that success, which only depended on his ask∣ing her the question.</P>
<P>I will not pay so bad a compliment to that young gentleman's understanding as to say, he was the hand∣somest man nature ever formed; let it suffice to as∣sure my readers, that she had been far from deficient in adorning him with personal qualifications, to which his politeness gave an additional lus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re; his father dying whilst he was yet young, left him heir to a very large estate; on this proviso, that he should not come into the possession thereof, till he attained the age of twenty-five years: a right which though not allowed of, either by nature or justice, many pa∣rents thus assume, by prolonging the minority of their children. As he lived with his guardian, in the neighbourhood of Sir Thomas Hartry, he of course was intimate with that gentleman, and from his frequent visits at Oak-hall, had drank deep of the delicious poison of love, before he knew by what name of stile his regard; recollection of the pleasure which he had alway found in Maria's company, too soon, alas! convinced him of the true reason, and he several times determined to inform her thereof; but such is the modesty attendant on unfeigned love, that notwithstanding the various opportunities he had, his fear overcame his regard, and prevented his beginning the only subject on which he wish'd to talk; but 'tis not the tongue alone, that can declare
<PB N="49" REF="032122_0053_0FF1394917D472D8"/>
our passion; no, our eyes pronounce it, and every action speaks; what though he never told her that he lov'd, his whole behaviour shew'd it; it was ap∣parent to every eye; nor could Maria any longer be blind, to what she so earnestly wish'd to be true.</P>
<P>She saw it with pleasure; and thus Melvill had a more powerful advocate in her breast, than he even dared to hope: thus situated, she daily expected a declaration, and as often was disappointed; for though her behaviour gave him every encourage∣ment the nature of their connection would admit of, he could not so far overcome the natural timid re∣spect of his soul. Under these almost insupportable torments, his health, from inward grief, sensibly de∣clined; his life became burthensome and tedious; he never was easy one minute when out of her pre∣sence, and at the same time, was racked with the most tormenting fears of loosing her forever: In this un∣happy state did he for some time live, till no longer able to endure it, he determined to acquaint her with his inviolable attachment, and hope the best. When we have form'd any favorite scheme, it is an easy matter of putting it into execution; thus as Melvill had formed a design on the success of which, all the happiness of his future life depended, he burnt with the most eager impatience to be delivered from so painful an uncertainty; and as very few days passed in which he was not at Oak-hall, he soon found the so much wished for opportunity.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="032122_0054_0FF1394AD1F7B758"/>
One very warm day, after having dined there, Ma∣ria proposed a walk in the grove, which her parents immediately assented to, saying that they would fol∣low her; thus luckily leaving our young couple to∣gether at which Maria was not a little pleased. Mel∣vill having previously informed her, that when a proper time offered, he could wish to have some con∣versation with her; therefore joyfully leaving her parents to follow them, she set out with Melvill, al∣most dying with curiosity to know what he had to communicate.</P>
<P>She wished it might be what she suspected; tho' at the same time she was not totally devoid of fear, lest it should, not being provided with a suitable answer thereto: from these considerations therefore, her mind was far from being the most tranquil. Con∣scious of his intentions, Melvill was not in a very en∣viable situation, and trembled so violently, that had she not been as much agitated, it could never have escaped her notice: however, by both being equally concerned, they neither of them perceived it in the other, and thus walked without uttering a syllable, till they arrived at a bench in the grove, where they sat down, both still preserving the exactest silence: many attempts, indeed, to speak, were made on both sides, but nothing more than—Sir—and Madam—I beg your pardon—I thought you spoke—and such incoherent sentences passed, till alter some he∣sitation, Maria took courage enough to ask, what
<PB N="51" REF="032122_0055_0FF1394C82EA0478"/>
business Mr. Melvill could have with her? to which he returned no answer, and put her to the painful necessity of repeating the question; when no longer able to restrain his passion, he dropt on one knee, and seizing her hand cried, "Can you lovely Maria, even appear to be ignorant of what I have to say?—Who can be permitted to converse with you, with∣out involuntary loving you?—Can you be mistress of those charms and wonder at my passion?—Yes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earest angel, I love you with the most ardent affec∣tion; but could I have divin'd, that a declaration thereof would have so far offended you (as by your countenance I see you now are) my lips for ever should have been closed, and I would have carried the secret to my early grave. What vanity could induce me to hope your kind notice, with so small a share of attraction and merit to recommend me?—But do not, dear Maria, do not hate me; though you cannot love, do not despise me."—"Despise you!—no, Mr. Melvill, heaven forbid I should despise any one!—But pray, Sir, rise:—you distress me—in∣deed you do."—"I did not mean it, replied he, I would sooner die, than give you one moment's un∣easiness:—but will you then thus reject me for ever?—Oh! do not look with such chilling indifference: allow me to hope, without trespassing the bounds of delicacy, one favourable expression."—"What would you have me say?"—"Only that I am not quite indifferent to you, not▪ hateful"!—"You are,
<PB N="52" REF="032122_0056_0FF1394F66E634C8"/>
indeed, Sir, replied she, sighing) far from it."—"And is it possible, returned Melvill that Maria can think tenderly of me.?"—"Soft, no more: here are my father and mother."—"But may I then be per∣mitted, says the impatient lover, to impart my fur∣ther sentiments by letter?—"Any thing, if you will now be silent: another time I'll hear you or from you."</P>
<P>The arrival of Sir Thomas and Lady Hartry put an end to the conversation for this time. The dis∣course turned on different topics, and our young cou∣ple parted much better pleased with each other than when they met; Maria, to find that she had no placed her affections on a senseless and unworthy object; and Melvill, that he had gained a kind of permission to write to her, which he determined to do immediately on his return home.</P>

<P>BEFORE I proceed any farther, I must beg leave to introduce to my readers, some new acquaintances I mean the family of Mr. Howard, Melvill's guar∣dian;
<PB N="53" REF="032122_0057_0FF13956554AF550"/>
which indeed was not large, as it consisted on∣ly of himself, his daughter Charlotte, and his ward.—This gentleman had formerly been in a capital busi∣ness in London; during which time, he had con∣tracted an intimacy with Melvill's father; who, from his candour and just dealing, conceived so good an opinion of him, as at his death to appoint him sole guardian of his son.</P>
<P>On the loss of his wife, he retired with his daugh∣ter, who was then an infant, to the small estate where he now resided to enjoy the down hill of his life, far from the noisy bustling of that world, the major part of which he was convinced, made fraud their only study, and money their almost sole pursuit: altho' his rank in life was not equal to Sir Thomas Hartry, nevertheless a great intimacy subsisted between the two families; and Charles Hartry and Charlotte be∣ing play fellows when young, conceived for each other a cordial and unfeigned friendship, which as they grew up, ripening into mutual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ove, in their in∣advertent youth they readily gave way to it; but when the pleasing fondness in some measure was subsided in a settled passion, and reason had recov∣ered her lost sway, Charles began seriously to consi∣der, that on account of their inequality of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it would be impossible ever to make his father agree to the match: and as he had too much real love for poor Charlotte, to think of involving her in certain distress, by a clandestine marriage, he had no other
<PB N="54" REF="032122_0058_0FF13958FB547A00"/>
resource left, than the aforementioned manner of leaving Oak-Hall; flattering himself, that absence would efface the remembrance of what he dared not cherish in his breast; nor would he venture to take leave of the darling of his heart, lest her presence and arguments should shake the firm resolve which he had made. After his departure, and not till then, would he inform her of his reasons for this step, which he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id by letter; and although she law the justness and propriety thereof, in their full force, his absence could not fail of being a heavy cause of grief to her; however as resignation was the only medi∣cine which could restore her peace, she patiently sub∣mitted to her misfortunes; though being destitute of a friend, to whom she might relate the story of her woe, she could not forbear sometimes in private, paying to his memory the tribute of a tear; till as Maria grew up, they form'd an intimacy, which from a similarity of sentiments, was soon converted into friendship; and Charlotte had the satisfaction of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> her heart of the load under which it laboured, to that person from whom she was sure to meet the generous return of compassion: nor was her confidence misplaced; Maria saw, and piti∣ed her misfortunes; and by being frequently with her, kindly endeavoured to dispel that gloom which hung over <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> countenance, while alone. Melvill therefore knowing the friendly connection which subsisted between them, determined thro' Charlotte's mean's, to get a letter conveyed to Maria; and ac∣cordingly,

<P>IN what words shall I express my sorrow, for the pain that my yesterday's behaviour gave you?

<P>On reading this extraordinary note, our hero was little better than one mad: his mind was agitated
<PB N="58" REF="032122_0062_0FF13965A80EC6A8"/>
with the most perplexing doubts and fears; and in this agony did he set out for Oak-hall, without giv∣ing any answer to the repeated questions of Miss How∣ard, who had no small reason to be surprized at his behaviour; nor indeed could she form any conjec∣ture of the cause, 'till, just as he was sitting out, throwing her Maria's note, he cried, "Madam, read that;—then wonder, if you can, that I am distract∣ed."</P>
<P>On his arrival at Sir Thomas Hartry's, he found that both he and his lady were out, but that Maria had walked into the grove; thither he hastened with all the impetuosity of a lover, and found her on the same bench, where but the preceeding day he had disclosed his love; he found her, 'tis true;—but, oh heart piercing sight! with one hand she was sup∣porting her head, and with the other, she wiped away the tears, which fell in torrents from her lovely eyes. She was so lost in thought, that he got pretty near before she perceived him; but when the rustling of the leaves drew her attention that way, starting up, with eager transports, she cry'd, "Oh! Mr. Melvill, is it you? I am glad you are come."—Then smiling through her tears, she added, "Have I not over∣stepp'd the bounds of modesty, in thus desiring to see you?"—"Tell me, my dear Maria (said he) tell me, what is it that affects you, inform me, I beseech you, what can be the cause of that uneasiness which I see so strongly printed on your countenance?"—"You were no sooner (answered she) departed yes∣terday,
<PB N="59" REF="032122_0063_0FF139676D1FBA30"/>
than my father informed me, that he was just come from Sir Toby Clunch, who had been to make a proposal for an alliance of the two families, by his son's marriage with me; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o my sorrow, he was so thoroughly resolved upon it, that it was in vain that I pleaded my dislike to Mr. Clunch; he who has hitherto been so indulgent a parent, nor ever off∣ered to force my inclinations in an affair of this na∣ture, has insisted on my receiving this gentleman as one who is to be my husband; and I am ordered this afternoon to prepare for an interview."—"And can you! can my Maria (said Melvill) thus cruelly re∣solve to abandon me forever, just when I have had resolution enough to declare my love?"—"You know (said she) it is my father's order; and you must likewise know the inevitable consequence of diso∣bedience from a man of his violent temper."—"And was this your business with me, Madam?—but I will not complain; for since I am indifferent to Miss Hartry, it matters not what becomes of me:—that you may forever be happy," was all that he could answer; and was just going to quit the place, when Maria recalled him, by saying with a tone of voice, that astonished him, "although Mr. Melvil may here∣after despise me, for my ingenuity, in so readily ac∣knowledging my passion; nevertheless I can on no consideration, be hypocrite enough to disguise the real sentiments of my heart; what that dictates my mouth must utter, nor can I to gain the world, be
<PB N="60" REF="032122_0064_0FF1396B5E655F40"/>
guilty of the least deceit; no, Sir be assured that I will never give my hand to any one but you, even at the altar, should they drag me there;—I will there assert my right of nature as a free-born Christian, nor give my hand to any one when my heart is al∣ready disposed of to another."—On hearing this, Melvill stood like one thunderstruck or petrified; at last taking her hand, with an inexpressible tender∣ness, he said, "Despise you!—no my dear Maria; I honour, I revere you for your ingenuous generosity of sentiment:—amiable girl!—that could at once throw aside <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he veil of dissimulation, her sex so oft∣en affect, and thus openly confess her regard;—oh, my dear angel you are too good, I can never deserve i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>."—"Indeed you do (interrupted she) and much more; but at present let us consider of the most probable means to extricate ourselves from this di∣lemma; which the precipitate unkindness of a posi∣tive parent, has thrown us into."—</P>
<P>After some conversation on the subject, it was a∣greed, that she should inform Mr. Clunch of her dis∣like to him; and if that would not do, even of her preposession in favour of another; to persuade him to discontinue his visits; and, having exchanged vows of mutual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they parted; she, to prepare for the reception of a man whom she detested, and he to relate all that had passed to Charlotte, which he did immediately on his return home.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MR. Clunch was the sole heir of Sir Toby Clunch, who having lost his wife in childbed of this son, grew so immoderately fond of him as never to suffer him out of his sight; so that we may reason∣ably suppose the education that he gave him was not the most refined; indeed his only concern was, to make him master of hunting, shooting, and other such rustic qualifications; in which he succeeded so happily, as to have him reckoned at the age of twen∣ty-five, the time of this proposal, the completest sportsman in the country; that is, he would fight a main of cocks, drive a set of horses, ride a fox chase, drink his bottle, or shoot flying, with any man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the three kingdoms for five hundred guineas, play or pay; and in these five things consisted all his excel∣lence; sweet recommendations! to a girl of Ma∣ria's delicate feelings: his father had likewise not
<PB N="62" REF="032122_0066_0FF139720F331D00"/>
forgot to instil some of his favourite principles into him; such as, "Children have not, or ought not to have, any will of their own;—that all their actions tend to one great end,—obedience," and many others equally arbitrary and ridiculous.—When Sir Toby therefore mentioned this match to him, all the an∣swer he made to it was,—"Why, ay, I'll marry her, if you think it proper; otherwise, I am very well as I am,—howsomever, I'm glad you've appointed this afternoon for the meeting, because I am en∣gaged to hunt to-morrow with neighbour Trott∣all."—</P>
<P>Such was the gentleman who arrived at Oak-Hall to pay his addresses to the loveliest of her sex; and to whose beauty her anxiety and concern gave an additional lustre: After a little general conversation, the young couple were left alone, and some time e∣lapsed before one word was spoke on either side, Mr. Clunch being very busy in tying some kno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he lash of his whip; however recollecting himself, he approach'd nearer to Maria, and made the following elegant speech.</P>
<P>"I suppose Miss, you know my business here;—my father has ordered me to wait on you; for as he says, we are to be married, he thinks it proper we should be a little acquainted beforehand; though for my own part, I don't see the necessity for it; but it seems it is the way of your great folks; and since I am here, I'll tell you a piece of my mind—look
<PB N="63" REF="032122_0067_0FF13976EEFD9250"/>
ye, Miss, I am a man of few words.—I don't love your high-flown speeches, because I don't under∣stand them, if you can like me for a husband—I'm your man: but what do I say—if? for your fa∣ther says you must, and that's enough."—A great deal more of the same sort did Maria suffer him to run on, before she interrupted him; which she at length did, though in the gentelest terms possible, left he should fly into a passion, and thereby rouse her father, whom she knew to be not far off;—with the most persuasive eloquence "she begg'd him not to importane her any longer on the subject, for that she could never think of him for an husband, that she should always be proud to respect him as an acquaintance; but found herself unequal to the task of loving him with the tenderness of a wife."</P>
<P>Rough as the surrounding woods, all the answer this unfeeling brute returned to her remonstrances, was, "why, for the matter of that, I can't help it—I believe there will be but little love lost between us; nor should I ever have troubled my head about lov∣ing you, but that my father has expressly said, I shall marry you; and your's says the same."—"I am sure he could not so far have forgot himself," replied Maria.—"Nay, but he did, answered the squire, and marry me you must; unless you have a mind to be a disobedient girl:—but as I am obliged to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e out ear∣ly to-morrow, I will take my leave of you; so Miss, I wish you a good night:—I shall acquaint Sir Tho∣mas
<PB N="64" REF="032122_0068_0FF1397A91AE6DA0"/>
of your behaviour, I assure you;—your servant.—So saying, he fallied out in quest of her father, to whom he related all that had passed, not without some favorable additions on his own side.</P>
<P>When Maria found herself alone, bursting into tears, with uplifted hands, she exclaimed,—"And is it possible, my father can seriously think of marrying me to such a wretch?—a brute, devoid of every sense of feeling!—"<HI>Your father says you</HI> SHALL <HI>marry me,</HI> those were his words:—Sure no such unjust re∣solve ever could escape his lips.—Would he, who hitherto has let my inclinations be as free as air, for the sake of a little pelf, tie me to a wretch whom my soul detests, on whom I can never look but with abhorrence?—SHALL <HI>marry me!</HI>—Surely, if the sin of disobedience admits of palliation, it is where parents cruelly usurp an authority, by endeavouring to force the hearts of their children; and which no situation in life, however elevated or debased, can give them a just right to.—Oh! Melvill, you have my heart, and on you alone will I bestow my hand."</P>
<P>Thus was the lovely Maria bewailing her misfor∣tunes, when the door opened, and presented her fa∣ther, with a much more angry look than she had ever seen him wear before:—"Little did I think Maria, said he, on entering, that I should ever have so much occasion to be dissatisfied with you, what is the rea∣son that you do not behave even with common civ∣ility to the man whom I have fixed upon for your
<PB N="65" REF="032122_0069_0FF1397D74E221B8"/>
husband?"—"I did indeed Sir, said she behave re∣spectfully to him; Oh Sir!—on my knees, let me intreat you by all the tender ties of nature, to remem∣ber, that equality and sympathy of feelings in marri∣age, is the only probable method to ensure felicity; do not make your only child unhappy, by dooming her to receive the churlish addresses of that odious man.—Man, do I call him? he is not worthy the name; a brute, that,"—"This to my face, interrupt∣ed Sir Thomas, take care, take care what you say; I have always been a kind, indulgent father to you, can forgive any thing but obstinate disobedience.—Make you unhappy!—why, have not I provided an husband for you? a rich man!—don't I do all in my power to make you happy?—and now fore∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ooth, you say you don't like him; what, I suppose you want a frenchified beau, full of flattery and fash∣ion, a thing made by taylors and barbers; go, go, you're a silly girl, and don't know what you like;—besides, what right have you to like?—it is I must like. Look ye, Maria, if you don't alter your be∣haviour to Mr. Clunch, I'll I'll—but I'm in a pas∣sion, and won't make any resolution; however, don't provoke me, beware of the consequences, that is all, beware of the consequences."—So saying he flung her from him, with all the heat of passion, on the ground, where she lay hardly sensible, and presented a spectacle sufficient to have touch'd the most ob∣durate heart: Sir Thomas was leaving her in this
<PB N="66" REF="032122_0070_0FF13981907322C8"/>
condition, when lady Hartry entered the room, brought thither by the elevation of her husband's voice; as soon as Maria saw her mother, immediate∣ly rising up, she desired her to intercede for her with Sir, Thomas, whom she said, she had very unwilling∣ly disobliged, by expressing her reluctance at receiv∣ing the visits of Mr. Clunch, as of one who was to be her husband and earnestly begg'd her to dissuade him from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he odious match on which he had set his heart.—As nothing out of the common course of nature can be of any long continuance, so Sir Thomas's passion soon began to subside, and give way to the powerful conductress of all our actions, rea∣son; nor was he long able to withstand the well timed arguments of a sensible wife, joined to the more powerful solicitations of an amiable daughter, but kissing Maria, told her he had been too hasty, and saw his error, bid her be a good girl, and endeavor to like Mr. Clunch; and concluded with an assurance of doing every thing in his power to make her hap∣py.—Thus this quarrel ended, and in an hour not only seemed but really was forgot, by all the parties, except the heroine of the piece, whose rest that night was not a little disturbed, by the concern she felt for her father's obstinacy, in thus persisting in a match, which she never could or would agree to.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AS none of the family at Oak-Hall were acquaint∣ed with Melvill's passion, he continued his visits there as usual, and in a few days had the happiness of being an hour with his Maria, who informed him o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all the particulars of the scene related in the last chapter. The result of their conference was, that Maria should discover the history of their passion to her mother, and beg her kind assistance, in endeav∣ouring to persuade Sir Thomas to agree to their mar∣riage; accordingly she soon found an opportunity of relating the affair to Lady Hartry, which she did with the most candid ingenuity, without concealing a single circumstance; at the same time entreating her, as she valued her happiness and peace of mind, to persuade Sir Thomas not to attempt to force her inclinations, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay her under the severe task of dis∣obedience to a parent's command. This good wo∣man was so well pleased at her daughter's sincerity, that she wanted but little persuasion to do what she was desired, and promised, that the first opportunity she had, she would use all the rhetoric she was mist∣ress of, to persude her husband to relinquish all thoughts of Mr. Clunch.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="032122_0072_0FF139851DEE46F8"/>
The next time they were alone, he luckily opened the subject, by saying," I can't imagine what rea∣son that girl can have, for so strongly objecting to marrying the person whom my prudence has select∣ed, as one fit to be her husband; a young man of person, family and fortune, who demands no money till after my death too; a plaguing, provoking little jade; when I have found a suitable match for her, in all respects, she forsooth, must object to it, by say∣ing, <HI>She cannot love him,</HI> but she shall have him I'm determined, or I'll never give her a farthing."—As lady Hartry had resolv'd not to mention a word of Melvill, lest he should imagine, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e sometimes would, that she was joined in a plot against him;—she only interrupted him, by gently saying, "Nay▪ "now my dear, you are indeed too violent; consider that we can never account for natural antipathies of our own, to particular people, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> less for these of others; she is young and may hereafter know better; but let me entreat you, as she is so strongly resolv∣ed against the match, to think no more of it. Don't Sir Thomas, make your girl unhappy."—But all this signified nothing; he had formed a resolution, and it was not in the power of words to make him alter it; he was resolutely determined not to give up the point, thorefore ending were he began, "that if she would not marry Clunch, he would disinherit her, he left the room.</P>
<P>Maria had been waiting to be informed of her
<PB N="69" REF="032122_0073_0FF13987F185A490"/>
doom from her mother, and though when she saw Sir Thomas, she thought she could too plainly read it in his countenance; still as uncertainty, even in mi∣sery, is painful, she was willing to be convinced of her wretchedness; and accordingly hastened to la∣dy Hartry, whom she found in tears, and who, after having endeavoured in some measure to comfort her, inform'd her circumstantially of all that had passed; she for some time, heard her with great seeming pa∣tience, and finding she had done speaking, clasping her hand, immediately exclaimed with great ener∣gy,—"and does he still thus cruelly persist in his resolve? then am I doom'd for ever to be miserable, as no power on earth shall ever force me to agree to it."—Lady Hartry endeavoured all in her power to argue Maria into temperature; and, as eloquence is to reason down the fever of the blood, and sooth with words the tumult of the soul, so it never was better applied than at present; for she in a short time cooly listened to her mother's advice, which was to inform Melvill of what had passed, and give him leave to make open proposals to her father, who, added she, when he finds your affection fixed on ano∣ther object, may perhaps give his consent to that, which it will not be in his power to prevent."—Ma∣ria accordingly, the next morning, wrote a letter to Melvill, informing him of what the reader has be∣fore heard, and concluded it in these words, "Since my father has thought proper to throw off the indul∣gence
<PB N="70" REF="032122_0074_0FF1398E5494E7D8"/>
which ought to accompany that name, you have my free consent, to make whatever proposals to him your love dictates."—His regard for her, must indeed have been very trifling, not to have un∣derstood her meaning, which he did in its full force, and accordingly waited on Sir Thomas that very day; and after the first civilities were over, opened to him the occasion of his visit; who, as it was quite unexpected, did not attempt to interrupt him in his discourse; but when he had finished, made the fol∣lowing r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly.—"I shall always esteem Mr. Mel∣vill, as a friend and neighbour; but can never think of him for a son in-law;—I have passed my word to another gentleman; had I not I could ne∣ver listen to your proposals.—Consider, Sir, that by your late father's will, you are not of age, nor will be these three years; you can therefore make no settlement on Maria, except her own fortune, which a beggar can equally do; and would you have me give my only daughter to a beggar? for such in fact it would be: and as for trusting to your love for three years hence would be nothing at all, pos∣session soon cloys; for what man rises from a feast with that keen appetite with which he first <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> down?"—"I am sorry, very sorry, Sir, said Melvill, to find you have so bad an opinion of me; but even allowing my love for your daughter should abate, I say, Sir, allowing your cruel, unjust suspicion to prove true, love for myself would engage me to ful∣fill

my promises,—my honour, Sir."—Honour, cri∣ed Sir Thomas, is not what it was; I remember when, as it ought, it was as sacred as a man's bond, and I should have thought myself as secure from the one as the other; but that time is past, and I very much fear, never to be recalled.—Honour is the offspring of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>air truth and honesty, yet to what base, what scandalous uses do we see it perverted?—Does a man want to seduce an innocent girl, honour's his cry, honour will oblige him to marry her;—and thus, while he professes a most noble, glorious vir∣tue, does he no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> commit the most abandoned acts of wickedness!—It is now so shamefully corrupted, that it saves but for a gilded bait <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o catch unwary fools; I am sorry to say it, but who trusts to the bare prospect of a man's honour, trusts too often to a broken staff: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be it from me to arraign your's.—No Sir, I believe you may have a strict sense <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, I hope you have; if so, I am glad of it; but still I cannot think of you for my daughter, don't let me hear any more of it; I beg you will not rob me of an agreeable acquaintance, by laying me under the necessity of forbidding you my house."—Melvill found the truth of all he said so strong, that he could make no answer to i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and Sir Thomas was leaving the room, when he caught him by the hand, crying, in the most supplicating tone, "Do not, dear Sir, make your amiable daughter unhappy by a refusal,"—"Unhappy! re-echoed Sir Tho∣mas, why you have not sure?—You cannot so far have prevailed upon her, that she has agreed to this

So saying he fallied out in quest of the unfortunate Ma∣ria, who luckily was not to be found, and he return∣ed rather cooler than he went, to tell Melvill, that after what had passed, he must desire him to discon∣tinue his visits.—This was a painful sentence to our almost distracted lover; who, however, bore his misfortune with firmn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and departed from Oak∣hall, without gaining one sight of his amiable afflict∣ed.</P>

<P>SIR Thomas began now seriously <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> consider, that gentle means would be the most probable, to make his daughter conquer her dislike to one lover and obliterate her regard for the other: in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, therefore, he gently tax'd her with her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for Melvill, and as she had heard of his visit of which too well guessing the cause, she knew it would be to no purpose to deny it; and therefore acknow∣ledged his suspicions to be just; at the same time, begging his pardon, promising never to make him

unhappy by a clandestine marriage:—in answer to which, he informed her; that, if she should ever be guilty of such an imprudent step, from that day she must forfeit all pretentions to his favour; which to ensure, he still insisted on her receiving Clunch's visits, whom he inform'd her was the next day to be at Oak-hall:—she begg'd, she intreated, she would promise any thing, provided <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e would give up that point.—But her prayers and tears, alas, were all too ineffectual; his whole heart was set upon it nor could any argument, however strong and forcible, change the settled purpose of his soul.</P>
<P>Her time, therefore, now passed wretchedly, be∣ing bound to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> some company of a man, whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> detested; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the terrifying threats of her father: sometime indeed she gained a short res∣spite, by being left alone with her mother, who piti∣ed her situation, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> tenderly endeavoured to allevi∣ate the torments <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> her breast, with all the soft fell∣ings of an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> parent; and when Sir Thomas was from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome, as she knew that all her felicity was centered in Melvill's company, sent for him to Oak-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who, with j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y obeyed the glad summens, so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his moments would have passed far from disa∣greeable, had it not been for the melancholy reflec∣tion of what his dear Maria must suffer at other times; but as he saw there was no likelihood of his ever gaining her father's consent to their union, af∣ter some struggles of reflection, he ventured to men∣tion
<PB N="74" REF="032122_0078_0FF13996D9712730"/>
a secret marriage to her; but she would not listen to it, and silenced him by saying,—that though her father had thus thrown off the kindness of a pa∣rent, still she would support the duty of an obedient daughter, as she did not think any unkindness on his side, could authorize such an act of indiscretion in her. Happy would it be, were every young lady of this way of thinking; how many miserable hours would it then save themselves, and others.—</P>
<P>Various and many were the schemes which Mel∣vill thought of, whereby to gain Sir Thomas's con∣sent; but still they could afford him but the mo∣mentary pleasure of imagination, as he for some time could hit on none likely to effect it; however, after along patience and perseverance his invention fram'd one, which appear'd to him so likely to succeed, that he determined to mention it the next time he went to Oak-Hall. The wish'd for moment soon arriv'd, and the above thought gave him so unusual a flow of spirits, that Maria could not avoid asking him the reason: taking her hand with inexpressible tender∣ness, he reply'd,—"I have, my dearest life, at last, thought of something which may make us both hap∣py; but as some deceit is necessary on your side, I did not chose to mention it, being well convinced, that your sense of truth is so strict, you would scruple a falshood, even in thought."—Having thank'd him in a genteel manner for his compliment, she desir'd to know what it was, saying,—that if she thought there
<PB N="75" REF="032122_0079_0FF1399B72135DD0"/>
was any probability of its success, she would ven∣ture a great deal, to be freed from the misery in which she then lived; but, added she, here comes my mother, let her hear it; and if she approves there∣of, that alone will be reason sufficient for me to put it into execution.</P>
<P>Lady Hartry having joined the company, Melvill told them the scheme from which he entertained such flattering hopes, in the following words; "It is, said he, that Maria shall feign an implicit obedience to her father's commands, in receiving the addresses of Mr. Clunch▪ that she shall even carry her seeming duty so far, as to go to church with him, and then publicly refuse him at the altar: this of course will convince Sir Thomas of her firm resolve, never to marry the man whom he has fixed upon; which will also be so public an affront to my rival, as to shake off his disagreeable solicitations: I will take care to be present, and make use of all my rhetoric, to per∣suade him to consent to our union: if he is cruel enough to entertain a doubt of my making a settle∣ment on Maria, when I come of age, I will even a∣gree to have our marriage postponed to that period, and at the same time, to put a private one out of our power, will consent to reside abroad, during all the intervening time; and notwithstanding his late be∣haviour, I am so well convinced of his natural good∣ness of heart, that, added thereto my persuasion, the solemnity of the place, and his surprise at so sudden
<PB N="76" REF="032122_0080_0FF1399FDA91B260"/>
and unexpected an affair, will altogether, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e too much for him to resist; and then my dearest girl, we shall with pleasure look back on all those obstacles as stronger incitements to us, love each other hereafter with increasing ardor; for, as the poet says;
<Q><L>Love in security but faintly burns,</L>
<L>But after doubts and fears more bright returns.</L></Q></P>
<P>Although this was certainly the most unaccount∣able thought that ever entered into a mad man's head; still as a lover, we must not wonder at his a∣dopting it; and Maria coming under the same pre∣dicament, we must not be surprized, at his finding so little difficulty in persuading her to agree to any thing which carried with it the least probability of ensuring her happiness; tho' she often repeated, that the hypocrisy would be very painful; but what shall we say to lady Hartry? in whom, to use Hamlet's words, "The heigh-day in her blood was tame, was humble, and waited on the judgment;" yet such is the frailty of human nature, that though she made the most scruples, Melvill's persuasions, join'd to her wishes for Maria's happiness, soon overcame her scruples of deceit; and it was therefore agreed, that this scheme should be immediately carried into ex∣ecution; and as Maria was the principal actress, we may by sure she determined to hasten it as much as possible.</P>

<P>OUR lovers, thus happy in the anticipation of fu∣ture joys, had been sometime alone; when they were suddenly surprised by the unexpected return of Sir Thomas, who immediately burst into the room where they were sitting; happy was it for lady Hartry that she had left them, being thereby rendered unsus∣pected of having had a hand in this meeting; although the bare finding the young couple together, would have been sufficient grounds for Sir Thomas to have reprimanded Melvill; yet to add to the misfortune he had interrupted them in a minute, sacred alone to love and privacy; in short he had found his daugh∣ter clasp'd in the arms of him she fondly lov'd: to describe the surprize painted on each of their coun∣tenances at this minute, would require the pen of a Fielding, or the pencil of a Hogarth; there was but one part for Maria to take; and therefore with an assumed anger, pushing Melvill from her, she utter'd some few inarticulate words in a kind of reproof.—Sir Thomas now began, by telling him, that after what had passed, he was much surprised at seeing him
<PB N="78" REF="032122_0082_0FF139A48B3D9BF8"/>
there, and insisted he would not for the future trou∣ble Oak-Hall with his company, for if he did, as a gentleman, he should be obliged to call him to an account for his behaviour. Melvill, willing to im∣prove on the hint he had received from Maria, begg'd his pardon in the most humble manner: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e need no longer be under any apprehensions con∣cerning his visits at Oak-Hall, as he had been suffi∣ciently tutor'd on that subject by his daughter, whose anger he had already incurred, by his unpardonable presumption; so saying, he took his leave, inward∣ly pleas'd at having left Maria so fair an opening towards the prosecution of their scheme; nor was she at all behind-hand with him in contrivance: for when her father began to reprimand her for seeing Melvill, contrary to his express commands, she in∣terrupted him by saying, that according to his or∣ders, she had endeavour'd all in her power to forget him, in which she was so happy as to have succeed∣ed, but that, if she had any little esteem for him lef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, he had now forfeited it, by this last act of impru∣dence: as a proof of which, she was willing to re∣ceive favourably Mr. Clunch's visits, and ready to enter into an alliance with that family, as soon as was agreeable to her father.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas kis'd her, called her his good, his du∣tiful child; and in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fondness, was as ridiculously foolish, as in his anger, he had formerly been im∣prudently passionate, and though Maria, out of a
<PB N="79" REF="032122_0083_0FF139A92C33EEE8"/>
pretended coyness, objected to so early a time, he insisted on that day sev'night being fixed for the wedding, and that all necessary preparations should be immediately begun; to which our heroine, with great seeming reluctance, at length consented, pro∣mising to obey her father in every thing, who in∣stantly ran to communicate this good news to his wife.</P>
<P>It was on the evening of this happy day, before Sir Thomas had scarce recovered from the transports which the first knowledge of his daughter's obedi∣ence had thrown him into, when the happiness of this family was not a little increased, by the arrival of AEmily Summers, tho' the felicity of most of them sprung from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> causes: as this young lady was to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Oak-hall, her presence did not in the least restrain the lively sallies of the Baronet's joy; nor had she been long arrived, before she was given to understand the reason.—Nothing could equal her astonishment at this news, as she thought, from their long and sincere friendship, Maria had not behaved with her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> generosity, in concealing it from her, which she had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one, except giv∣ing her the hint, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> reader may remember, in her last letter, and which could refer to nothing else; nor was this thought confined to her own breast, she soon found an opportunity of taxing her friend with unkindness, who immediately related to her, all that the reader has before heard; as likewise
<PB N="80" REF="032122_0084_0FF139AD75F5CC08"/>
her intended scheme.—AEmily knew it would be to no purpose to dissuade her from it; and as Maria had put so much confidence in her, by trusting her with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecret of this nature, she could not in hon∣our, divulge it to Sir Thomas, of which at first, she had some design; she therefore, though without the least hopes of its success, seem'd to acquiesce therein, and promis'd to do all in her power towards the ex∣ecution of it. Charlotte Howard was the next day made acquainted with the arrival of their friend AEmily, and at the earnest request of both, added one more to this happy circle, for though Sir Thomas had dropp'd all acquaintance with Melvill, still this did not alter his behaviour to, or diminish his regard for the rest of Mr. Howard's family.</P>

<P>THE necessary preparations for Maria's wedding were immediately begun, and Clunch spent as much of his time as he could spare from his rustic amuse∣ments, at Oak-Hall with his intended bride, who
<PB N="81" REF="032122_0085_0FF139B350672090"/>
received his visits with great seeming complacense, conscious that they could be of no long continuance. When she was not thus employed, she had the felici∣ty of enjoying the company of her two friends, with∣out controul; and indeed the affection which these young ladies had mutually for each other, made their time to pass with the greatest social harmony; every day brought with it some new pleasure; and as the surest means of augmenting their festivity, each of them seem'd more assiduous to promote the bliss of the other two than her own. A sigh, indeed, would sometimes unwarily escape from poor Maria; who as the destined day drew nigh, seemed every moment to loose some of her resolution: to add to which, her friend Charlotte, on the day before the intended marriage, for reasons very apparent, made an excuse to return home; by that means avoiding being present at the proposed nuptials.</P>
<P>During this young lady's stay at Oak-Hall, poor Melvill's time had passed but heavily; however, to compensate for all his torments, she brought him a letter from Maria, containing fresh assurances of re∣gard; which when he received, in an involuntary extasy, he exclaimed;
<Q><L>Sweet love! sweet lines! sweet life!</L>
<L>Here is her hand, the agent of her heart,</L>
<L>Here is her oath for love, her honor's pawn,</L>
<L>Oh, that her father would approve our loves,</L>
<L>To seal our happiness with his consent!</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, heavenly Maria!</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="032122_0086_0FF139B504D077B8"/>
As it was agreed on that Melvill should leave Eng∣land, as soon as he had gained a promise from Sir Thomas to consent to their marriage when he came of age; he had taken care to prepare everything ne∣cessary for his voyage: nor indeed was he displeased at thus having a plea to satisfy his eager curiosity, by visiting foreign countries, though at the price of be∣ing separated from Maria. And when the destined morn arrived, he hastened to the church, were the other company were already assembled; consisting of the intended bride and bridegroom, AEmily Sum∣mers, Sir Thomas, and Lady Hartry, and Sir Toby Clunch: Maria trembled with apprehension; but that only served to cast an unusual glow upon her countenance, and made her look uncommonly beau∣tiful; nor was her concern on such an occasion taken notice of, as a modest diffidence is usual.</P>
<P>Although Melvill stood a great way behind the rest of the company, he could not avoid the eyes of Sir Thomas, who thought it not a little extraordina∣ry for him to be there; however, still keeping his post, he stood agitated by violent hopes and fears.—Maria went through the former part of the ceremo∣ny tolerably well, till the critical moment arrived; and here I fain would conceal the weakness of my heroine: but truth obliges me to maintain my cha∣racter, and inform my readers of every particular, without suppressing any. Judge then, if you possibly can, kind reader, what were poor Melvill's sensations,
<PB N="83" REF="032122_0087_0FF139BA0B754DC8"/>
when on her being asked the important question, af∣ter near a minute's silence, he heard her feebly pro∣nounce, I WILL: his astonishment and rage for some time, were both so great, that he stood motionless; at last, casting at her a look of distraction, he hurri∣ed out of the church, and throwing himself into a post chaise, which had been ordered to wait for him, proceeded to Mr. Howard's, to whom in a few mi∣nutes he related what had happened and set out the next day for Dover, but with a far different opinion of the female sex, than what he flattered himself he should have begun his travels with: thoughts of him∣self alone had for some time occupied his mind; but anger against Maria now took its place, which he vented as follows, "Yes, I have long been blinded by passion, but that at last is over, my natural reason has regain'd her power; and I can now see, nay feel what an abject wretch he must be, who trusts his hap∣piness in a woman's power; smiling mischiefs all, that crocodile like, flattery but to betray: thus then I disclaim all thoughts of a serious connexion with any of the sex; but why do I still talk, of, or trou∣ble myself about her, she is not worth a thought; and I hope I shall get quite clear of her idea before I reach Dover;"—on the road to which place we must leave him and return to see what happened at the church after his departure.</P>

<P>I DON'T doubt but my young female readers, if any such I am honoured with, will be apt to con∣demn and despise poor Maria for want of fidelity, or rather of resolution; but let them consider, and make her case their own, and I am sure their contempt will be converted into generosity. A young lady educated with so strict a sense of honour and truth as she was, could not be guilty of such premeditated deceit; the solemnity of the place, the awful grandeur of the ceremony, all forbade it; pas∣sion had before obscured her reason, but it now just∣ly appeared to her, like going to church with a de∣sign to utter a premeditated falsehood in the sight of God: yet notwithstanding all this, she suffered the most painful conflict, before she could so far let her virtue overcome her love; but when she had thus nobly gained an ascendancy over her passions, she left that innate satisfaction which conscious virtue
<PB N="85" REF="032122_0089_0FF13A1677671718"/>
always does, on the performance of any good ac∣tion; but that satisfaction was but of a very short du∣ration, and instantly vanished, when on turning her head round, she observed in Melvill's face the dis∣traction of his heart and immediately after saw him leave the church; it was then the thoughts of having deceived him, and lost him for ever, rush'd upon her mind in their full force; nay, even with aggravated circumstances: this was far too much for her tender nature to support; she immediately fainted away, before the material part of the ceremony were per∣formed, and threw the whole church into confusion: she was carried home senseless: but by being put to bed, and by the application of proper remedies soon came to herself.</P>
<P>Almost every one then present, put different con∣structions on this accident: No one except lady Hartry and AEmily were acquainted with the true cause; they had as well as Maria observed Melvill, and on his leaving the church in so extraordinary a manner, had too well guessed what where his inten∣tions: to these, when alone, our afflicted heroine unburthened her full heart; and having made all the excuses she could think of to palliate her infidel∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty, conjured her mother as a proof of her sympa∣thetic feelings, to send to know what was become of Melvill: lady Hartry, with true maternal fondness, was ready to admit of any plea that her da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghter
<PB N="86" REF="032122_0090_0FF139BED2B0C270"/>
could make, and joined with AEmily in assuring her, that she thought her more worthy of pity than cen∣sure; after which she mentioned her suspicions of Melvill's being gone abroad, the better to prepare her for such a stroke, in case it should prove true, and promised to satisfy her curiosity, by sending to Mr. Howard's immediately, which she accordingly did; and in return to her message, had the morti∣fication of hearing from Charlotte, that Melvill was by that time at Calais, having previous to his depar∣ture, informed Mr. Howard of that part of the af∣fair, which was left untold by her, only because she was not acquainted with the issue of their scheme; that his intention was to endeavour, by a variety of objects, to drive from his mind a woman, whom he no longer held worthy of a place in it; and lastly, that he had promised to write, when he arrived at Paris.—It was on this promise only, that Lady Har∣try ventured to inform her daughter of what she had heard, which she at length did, though with the great∣est caution and tenderness; gently breaking it to her, by almost imperceptible degrees, till she had made her acquainted with the whole.</P>
<P>Although poor Maria was very well prepared for this blow, and though it was no more than what she might reasonably expect, still she had flattered her∣self with the old proverb, That while there's life, there's hope: she had flattered herself, that when
<PB N="87" REF="032122_0091_0FF139C4A00E8330"/>
Melvill's anger began to subside, he would stay and see the end of so extraordinary an affair; that he would defer his journey, till he was thoroughly con∣vinced of her infidelity:—he thought very justly, that nothing could be a stronger proof thereof than thus giving herself to another before his face; his passion obscured those reasons which arose so power∣fully in her mind to countenance the act; those rea∣sons lasted but so long, as while she remained in that uncertainty of doubt and fear, but when the answer to her mother's note arrived, she insisted on seeing it, which lady Hartry at first refus'd, as thinking one part thereof, not so proper for her perusal; but as it is impossible long to maintain a denial of any thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we love, Maria soon got the better, and by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> victory was made completely miserable: for tho' her mother had before informed her of every part thereof, still she had done it in a manner which gave her some small gleam of hopes, and which, by the sight of it, she was convinced she had no reason to indulge; for a long time after reading it, her mind was torn by the contrary passions of contempt, love and pity; sometimes she would rail at him for not waiting to see the event of an affair, which it so near∣ly concerned him to be acquainted with; at others, she would express her commendations of him for thus behaving to a person who had used him so scan∣dalously, and then would vent the most bitter inve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ives
<PB N="88" REF="032122_0092_0FF139C7FB825C18"/>
against herself; but as according to the natural order of things, the human constitution cannot long thus exist upon the stretch, in a short time the agony of her mind affected the body, and threw her into a violent fever, in which she quickly became delirious, and was continually calling on Melvill; sometimes she would talk to him as if he were present, at others, she would fall into the most violent fits of passionate rage, and in this manner rave, till nature being al∣most exhausted, a flood of tears came seasonably to her relief.</P>
<P>Conscious, that from her so often mentioning Melvill's name, Sir Thomas must imagine there was something more at the bottom of this affair than he was acquainted with, lady Hartry, by the advice of AEmily, who behaved with more than common pru∣dence, in such a scene of complicated distress, related to him all she knew of the affair, kindly endeavour∣ing to exempt poor Maria from as much blame as she possibly could:—To her great joy, this news was received in a far different manner from what she ex∣pected; for as soon as Sir Thomas knew the cause of his daughter's illness, he us'd every means in his pow∣er to hasten her recovery; at her first interval of reason, with the most assiduous tenderness, he desir∣ed her to compose her spirits, acknowledging, that he was convinced of the folly of his conduct, and determined no longer to oppose her happiness; she
<PB N="89" REF="032122_0093_0FF139CA497C5C28"/>
thanked him for the kindness of his intention, adding—"how happy would this goodness once have made me! now 'tis an aggravation of my sorrow, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omes, like a reprieve when execution's past."</P>
<P>With all the affection of friendship, and at the same time, with the the unlimited extent of a paren∣tal love, he used every argument he could think of, to paliate her grief; and as a proof of the sincerity of his wishes for her happiness, instantly wrote a letter to Melvill, which he directed to the post house at Calais, acquainting him with the alteration of his sentiments, and kindly re-inviting him to Oak-Hall.</P>

<P>AS Maria had now gained her father's consent to an union, which, she flattered herself, would one day take place; notwithstanding the fears she had, lest Melvill should meet abroad with some lady, whose beauty, joined to her ill usage might easily efface all
<PB N="90" REF="032122_0094_0FF139CECD0367D8"/>
remembrance of her former kindness; the tranquility of her mind was soon in some degree restored, which added to her youth and natural strength, began to re∣establish her health; the roses that so long had left her cheeks, began now to recover their accustomed bloom; and as after a tedious gloomy winter, all na∣ture gladdens at the approach of spring, so there was no one in the house, or neighbourhood, who did not really rejoice at Maria's recovery, which was in a short time totally completed:—and thus the family at Oak-Hall, of which, AEmily still made one, all but Maria, regained their former serenity and peace.</P>
<P>When Mr. Clunch found that Sir Thomas was no longer an advocate for him with Maria, he was easi∣ly induced to retract his claim, and in a few weeks after, married the daughter of one of his father's ten∣ant's, with whom he probably found more real hap∣piness, than ever he could have done with a person, whose sentiments and pursuits were so widely diffe∣rent from his own.</P>
<P>As Sir Henry Summers had now been absent much longer than he at first intended, AEmily began to be not a little surprised thereat, as well as puzzled to find out what business he could have there to de∣tain him so long; nor could she avoid observing, that he had never made mention of it in any one of his letters; however, as he wrote constantly to inform her of his welfare, and as Mr. Martin had in the last
<PB N="91" REF="032122_0095_0FF139D345067BD8"/>
letter given her a hint of an intended visit, she was easily prevailed upon by Maria to remain at Oak∣Hall; where, by their mutual desire, Charlotte How∣ard now was.</P>
<P>Nothing therefore was wanting to complete the felicity of this family, but Melvill's return, which Maria had waited for, some-time, with the greatest resignation and patience; but when the period was e∣lapsed, whereat she had flattered herself with the pleasing expectation of beholding him, and in which she was most grievously disappointed, her former un∣easiness began to return, and from the natural incli∣nation which she had for solitude, soon settled into a melancholy despondence, when as if adverse fate had not sufficiently tormented her, Mr. Howard re∣ceived a letter from Melvill, wherein he informed him—"That he had just recovered from a violent fit of illness, and was preparing to leave Paris, where he then was, in order to visit Madrid; that it still remained his firm resolve to endeavor, by a quick succession of new objects, to recall his heart from Oak-Hall; that as he should be continually upon the move, it would be impossible for him to hear from England; his design in which was▪ to avoid seeing the very name of Hartry, that nothing might retard the cure he hoped in a short time to work in his mis∣placed affections."</P>
<P>It was very apparent from this, that he had never
<PB N="92" REF="032122_0096_0FF139D500212C30"/>
received the letter Sir Thomas sent after him to Ca∣lais: and although the news pierced poor Maria to the heart, yet still, to oblige her parents, she endeav∣oured to assume the placid smiles of cool indiffer∣ence: Oh, what a painful task to wear a cheerful countenance with a gloomy heart!—Out of duty and complaisance to them she entered into company, though at the same time she longed to be alone, to indulge her melancholy reflections on this unfortu∣nate affair, which was the more so to her, as she could blame no one for it but herself: her two bo∣som friends, AEmily and Charlotte, endeavoured all in their power to comfort her, the latter of whose company she was remarkably fond of, as she knew by fatal experience the torments of divided love, and would sometimes humour her affliction, by talk∣ing of Melvill, in return for which, Maria would sympathize with her in her grief, for the long, long lost Charles Hartry; in this manner, by each hav∣ing a friend to share in their afflictions, the burthen lay the lighter upon either:—But as these reflec∣tions will not deliver poor Maria from her misera∣ble situation; and as I at present see no probable means of doing it, I must be contented to leave her as she is, and take some further notice of AEmily's af∣fairs.</P>
<P>It was now in the delightful month of May, about six in the evening, while our female friends were
<PB N="93" REF="032122_0097_0FF139DA0C225E78"/>
sitting in a natural alcove, formed by surrounding jessamines and woodbines, their attention absorbed, in listening to a natural concert of the feathered cho∣risters around, superior far to any which the rigid rules of art can dictate, when they were suddenly surprised by the appearance of a gentleman, whom, on his nearer approach, AEmily discovered to be no other than Mr. Martin; who, to add to her joy, in∣formed her, that her uncle would be there the ensu∣ing morning: the first salutations were scarce over, before Charlotte and Maria took an opportunity of leaving their friend to enjoy, without reserve, the company of that man, for whom alone she seemed to wish to live: AEmily saw, or at least fancied she saw, an unusual seriousness painted on his counte∣nance, nor could she forbear asking him the reason; but he evaded an explanation, by the weak excuse of being fatigued by his journey; though this was not the real cause, as the reader will presently be convinced.—The next morning, agreeable to what Mr. Martin had told her, AEmily had the satisfaction of embracing her uncle; who in a short time alter his arrival, not a little astonished her by the follow∣ing discourse.</P>
<P>"It may not now my dear AEmily be improper to acquaint you with the cause of my so sudden expe∣dition, at which I don't doubt you were very much surprized; but I am sure you will be much more
<PB N="94" REF="032122_0098_0FF139DBE9FAF6A8"/>
so, when previous to what I have to say, I must as∣sure you, you are not my niece; nor did I, till with∣in this short time, know any relation you had in the world."—AEmily's surprize at hearing this piece of news, may be much better imagined than described; however, as no word could convey a proper idea of her astonishment, she sat silent, and suffered Sir Harry to proceed without interruption.—He had in∣formed Mr. Martin, who was then present, of this affair before; and indeed this was the cause of that inquietude which AEmily had taken notice of the preceeding evening; for when he found there was no ties of kindred between Sir Harry and his ward, and still heard the warm manner in which he spoke of her, he began to be under some apprehensions, left in his old age he should play the fool, by singing am∣orous ditties to the bloom of nineteen; so ready are we to surmise whatever our fears dictates.—Sir Har∣ry now related to AEmily all the circumstances rela∣tive to his finding her, that the reader has before heard in the former part of this history; and then proceeded as follows.</P>
<P>"Soon after this extraordinary affair happened, I was telling to a circle of gentleman, none of whom chose to believe me, but all persisted in attributing to me a larger share thereof than I had any right to.

to no purpose; till a short time ago an intimate ac∣quaintance, one of those to whom I had mentioned the circumstance, and now residing in Ireland, sent me word, that he had discovered the parent of my AEmily; and if I wished to be fully satisfied thereof, desired my immediate attendance at Dublin.—You may easily imagine that I did not hesitate one mo∣ment what step to take; the hurry of my departure will sufficiently evince to you, the eagerness of my curiosity.—On my arrival in Dublin, my friend at whose desire I had made the journey, informed me, that he had met with the lady, concerning whom he had wrote to me, after the following manner; by the accidental misfortune of her foot's slipping, she had fallen down in the street, had he not, by the greatest good luck, been behind her, and immediately led her into an adjoining shop: when she was a little recov∣ered from the fright which this accident had thrown her into, she found that she had happily received no other hurt, than a slight scratch on the hand by a post, on which she had endeavoured to save herself from salling; when, on taking out her pocket book to search for a bit of sticking plaister to apply to the wound, an open paper fell out, which he picked up and gave her, though he could not avoid first read∣ing it as he held it in his hand, having seen some words he recollected elsewhere; and was amazed to find it contained the same words, as that which I dis∣covered pinned on your breast, and which I had fre∣quently
<PB N="96" REF="032122_0100_0FF139E2844F12B8"/>
shewn him.—So extraordinary a circum∣stance awakened his curiosity; and in the way to her lodgings, where common civilities obliged him to at∣tend her, with many apologies for the question, he begged to know on what occasion those words were wrote, and as he assured her, that he had other mo∣tives than curiosity for his inquiry, she readily sa∣tisfied him; at the same time, giving him the histo∣ry of her life, from which he was convinced it could be no other than your mother.—At my desire he im∣mediately introduced me to her; and having before informed her, what share I had in the business, she was as eager to relate as I was to hear, the story of her woe; though both our desires sprung from diff∣erent motives; mine, from the hopes of making a worthy woman happy, for such, from my friends ac∣count, I was sure she must be, by delivering to her arms a daughter, whom a monarch might boast of; and hers, from the expectation of becoming a joy∣ful mother, at a time when she had so little reason to look for such a blessing:—She therefore satisfied my curiosity, as follows.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>BORN and bred in retirement and ease, at more than a hundred miles distance from the capital of England, my youthful days were pass'd in one con∣tinued round of innocent amusements; educated un∣der the fostering wing of indulgent parents, whose utmost wishes were their childrens happiness; my inclinations never learnt to stray, but where my duty led them; the smiles of benignity sat upon my youthful countenance, every circumstance of life conspired to make me bless'd:—I had a brother whom I loved dearly as myself: and as our ages were nearly equal, our studies and pursuits were made so too, under that man, who was at once our tutor and our parent:—I read the Classics and learnt French with him, and to return, he was sometimes permitted to take a lesson on the guittar with me; but as we were only suffered to use these as amusements at our leisure hours, by thus being taught to consider in the light of indulgences, what were really edifying and useful studies, we of course made much more progress
<PB N="98" REF="032122_0102_0FF139ED4A817BD0"/>
therein than if we had look'd upon them as inflicted tasks, which we were obliged to perform.</P>
<P>As my father's estate was not sufficient to enable h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m to bring up my brother independent of the world he gave him leave to choose his profession, when pitching on the army, he immediately bought him a commission in the first regiment of guards, and sent him to London, to perform the duty which he owed his king and country, not without many tears on both sides, at his departure.—You may easily imagine how much I felt for the loss of a brother, whom I loved with such tenderness: but as he promised to write to me frequently, by the alternate assistance of my books and my guittar, I made a shift to support at least the appearance of tolerable spirits; though I will own, I felt this blow more severely than I dar'd then confess;—but as the All-wise being never does any thing without proposing some end thereby▪ so this had one great good atttending it; for as I have since found, by fatal experience, that I was born to undergo many misfortunes—this, so early in life, serv'd to inure me to what I since have suffered; and what was then the cause of so much affliction to me, on a cool retrospection, appears to be nothing, in comparison of what I since have felt:—for thus we always swell our present pain, till some severer grief arrives, which shews what's past, without extenua∣tion or increase in its true light.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="032122_0103_0FF139F06C264AB8"/>
I thus give you the history of my family, because in my brother's, my own is included.—About a year after his departure, he informed us by letter, of an intended visit, having obtained leave of absence for three months; and that he should bring a particular acquaintance, who was a brother officer with him: accordingly, in a few days he arrived, attended by his friend, whose name was Modish: this gentleman, who was a lieutenant as well as my brother, seem'd by nature form'd to please the women; had I said for their destruction, my own circumstances would too fatally justify the expression, as I can with truth affirm, that I have never felt the influence of joy, since first I knew him; but still I don't repent of my acquaintance; for wheresoever he is, may heaven protect him!—he had not been long at my father's before his behaviour too plainly convin'd me of his sentiment; in short he soon found an opportunity of declaring his passion for me, in the warmest terms; nor will I pretend to play the hypocrite, by say∣ing I was displeased at it and though prudence, as he had no fortune, but the income of his commission, would not suffer me to receive his addresses openly as it would have been madness in me, to have ima∣gined that my father ever would agree to the match, yet in private I gave him all the encouragement that modesty would allow of, or his generosity have asked.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="032122_0104_0FF139F298EE2BF0"/>
I was now one-and-twenty, and had just received a thousand pounds left me by an uncle, and which was all the fortune I had independent of my father; and, in short, Sir, my affection for him was so deep∣ly rooted, that he too easily prevailed upon me to fly from the best of parents, and receive him as a husband:—he then wrote to my brother, acquaint∣ing him therewith, and desiring him to break the af∣fair to my father, and intreat his forgiveness; after which we proceeded to London, where we waited for some time, in daily expectation of an answer, but were amaz'd to find ourselves disappointed, e∣specially as Mr. Modish had had the precaution to desire my brother to direct to him at a certain coffee house; thither he went every day, but every day had the mortification of a disappointment:—and altho' my husband's regard for me, seemed every moment to increase; in such a situation, I was far from be∣ing happy:—the consideration of being neglect∣fully deserted by my parents, and all that my soul held dear in the world, except the partner of my heart, was too tormenting a thought for me not to be sensibly afflicted with.—We had been in town about two months, when the following misfortune happened to deprive me even of the pleasure which my husband's company afforded.</P>
<P>He was returning home one night from the coffee∣house, about twelve o'clock, elevated in liquor, when
<PB N="101" REF="032122_0105_0FF139F4C342D2D8"/>
a person from behind, gave him a slap on the should∣er.—Imagining he was beset by foot-pads, turning suddenly round, he fired one of the pistols which he always carried with him, and instantly saw the per∣son who had thus attacked him, fall to the ground. A crowd of watchmen immediately assembled, drawn thither by the report of his pistol—but—good heav∣ens!—what was his consternation, when he found the person he had shot, to be no other than my bro∣ther, and whose slap on the shoulder, which was a mark of familiarity and affection, had been thus fa∣tally misconstrued.—Concluding that he had certain∣ly killed him, under pretence of fetching a surgeon, he ran home, and informing me of this melancholy accident, took half my fortune, which luckily was in the house, and tenderly embracing me, hurried away to preserve himself.</P>
<P>As he suspected, so it happened, for my brother di∣ed in less than an hour, and rewards were immedi∣ately advertised for the apprehension of his murder∣er:—oh! Sir! think what a situation this was;—in one sad hour, deprived of all my future prospects of felicity—my dearest brother dead;—my husband flown, I knew not where, and stigmatized as his de∣stroyer;—hourly branded with the name of villain, for as no one knew the truth of this affair, every time it was told, added to his discredit, and it at last reached my father's ears; maim'd and villainously
<PB N="102" REF="032122_0106_0FF139F67A80C6B0"/>
wrested every way to suit the purposes of avaricious relations; so that all he heard was, "that my husband was the murderer of his son."</P>
<P>According to the cruel expectation of the mali∣cious propagators of this report, he soon died:—nor did my mother long survive, both their ends being not a little hastened by this misfortune. Thus, Sir, was almost the whole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at once annihilated by an accidental<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> error; into which the best of men might easily have fallen.</P>
<P>In this accumulated distress, I had no friend to comfort or assist me, and though Mr. Modish had promised to inform me of his fate, I still remained entirely ignorant thereof, having never once heard from him since his departure; when, to crown all my misery, I found myself with child: although I had a pretty large sum of money left, it would daily diminish, and as I had no prospect of getting more, I even then began to anticipate the tortures of pover∣ty.—At the usual time, I was brought to bed of a daughter; and about six weeks after my delivery, had the luck of meeting with a lady, who had generosity enough to believe my story, and humanity enough to promise to assist me: nor did she fail to keep her word; in a few days after, she told me that a widow lady, to whom she had mentioned my misfortune, had kindly offered to take me with her to Ireland as a
<PB N="103" REF="032122_0107_0FF139FCBB5DD488"/>
companion, but that my having a child was an in∣surmountable obstacle—and now, Sir, shall I not forfeit your good opinion? by owning, that by the melancholy prospect before me, I was drove to make use of the following stratagem:—having fre∣quently heard your character for humanity extolled, I conveyed my little darling to a place were I fanci∣ed you were sure of seeing her, with a paper pinned to her breast, on which I wrote these words.—<HI>Un∣known stranger, whosoe'er thou art that find'st this luckless babe, shut not your ears against the tender cries of youthful innocence, but pity, cherish, and re∣ceive her; in return for which she will far o'erpay your generous care by her endearing prattle.</HI>—Hav∣ing heard, that according to my expectations, you had taken her into your house, I was much pleased at the success of my scheme, and with joy set out for Ireland, though it was not a little allayed, by my nev∣er having heard from Mr. Modish, who had now been gone near a year:—In short, Sir, not to trouble you with any unnecessary particulars, I remained here with my patroness, till her death, which happen∣ed here about half a year ago, when in return for my services, she left me her whole fortune, amounting to near ten thousand pounds: and being thereby put into a station of life, superior to my utmost wishes, I was preparing to set out for England, to make en∣quiries after my daughter, when I learnt accidentally from this gentlemn, what was her situation in the

<P>THUS, continued Sir Harry, did Mrs. Modish fully satisfy me, with regard to her being the real parent of my adopted AEmily: I therefore brought her with me to London, where she now is, and whether I don't doubt you will joyfully accompany me to morrow, to pay your duty to a woman who is every way deserving the title of your mother—And although, my AEmily, you are not my niece, never¦theless we are related, as I find your father was bro∣ther to my cousin Modish, whom you have often seen; and with whom, if the reader will revert to the fourth chapter, he will find sir Harry had a dis∣course on the subject of his behaviour to AEmily;—
<PB N="105" REF="032122_0109_0FF13A004E921270"/>
when he endeavoured to dissuade him from the no∣ble and humane resolution that he had made.—How little did he then know he was arguing against his own niece!—I have also, added Sir Harry since my return, on enquiring of my cousin concerning the fate of his brother, heard that he was lost on his pas∣sage to Italy; for which place he had embarked to avoid the officers of justice. As his marriage was an entire secret, he never had an opportunity of com∣municating it to his brother, who was then abroad; and who, till my information, never had the least suspicion thereof.</P>
<P>On observing that AEmily could not refrain from tears, at hearing the fate of that man to whom she owed her birth; he said, "Indeed, my dear, this sor∣row is unnecessary, as you never knew the person whose loss you are lamenting; and as heaven has been kind enough to restore to you a parent, who I am sure, will perform every duty, and amply sup∣ply the place of both father and mother.—This, my AEmily was the only reason why I desired you to defer your marriage till after my return: for as you have now a parent to apply to, mine is but an assumed authority; though I am convinced, she will readily give her consent to every thing which may contribute to your happiness."</P>
<P>As Mr. Martin was now entirely delivered from those apprehensions, which we hinted at above he
<PB N="106" REF="032122_0110_0FF13A0554785370"/>
soon recovered his usual flow of spirits: and con∣gratulated AEmily on her new acquisition, in terms of the greatest tenderness; as did the rest of the family at Oak-Hall; who were immediately made acquaint∣ed with this happy revolution.—Even poor Maria seem'd to forget the cause of her affliction, and share in the general joy.—The next morning Sir Harry <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et out for London, attended by Martin and AEmily, though not without being first made to promise, that they would return with Mrs. Modish, and there cel∣ebrate the nuptials of her daughter.</P>
<P>To describe the meeting between AEmily and her mother, would require the efforts of a stronger pen, than my poor inexperience is master of; let it suffice to say, that each was highly pleased with the acqui∣sition of so deserving a relation; and that this lady readily consented to her daughter's marriage with Mr. Martin, whom she from that moment consider'd as her son.—Sir Henry having generously presented his adopted child with ten thousand pounds, these happy people accompanied by Mrs. Modish, return∣ed to Sir Thomas Hartry's, where, in a short time, Martin's happiness was completed, by being put in possession of the truly amiable AEmily.</P>
<P>Although Maria, out of regard for her friend, could not refuse being present at the wedding, the reader may imagine how much this renewed her grief; the thoughts of having lately been to the same
<PB N="107" REF="032122_0111_0FF13A0AD99B0208"/>
church, on so different an occasion, and the melan∣choly circumstances attending it; all served to re∣vive that sorrow, the first tumults of which were as yet scarcely subsided; and though her breast at this juncture, was truly the seat of mourning and afflic∣tion, on her face she wore apparent marks of joy:—thus then, all were, or at least seemed happy. Sin∣cerity and affection here went hand in hand, and cor∣dially embraced each other: but mark the mutabil∣ity of all human affairs—oh, vain man! who can controul his fate? or dare to say, To-morrow is my own?—The joy that this family might truly boast, and the happiness which fate seemed to have provi∣ded for them, for many years to come, were at once cruelly destroyed, by an accident as unforeseen, as unprovided for.</P>
<P>The day after their marriage, AEmily proposed a ride, which the unfortunate Martin too readily ac∣quiesced in; and they were scarce got a hundred yards from the house, before her horse took fright at some linen hanging on a hedge: when, not being the most expert horse-woman, she lost her seat, and was thrown with the most violent force, with her head a∣gainst the foot of a tree, from thence she was taken up and carried home speechless:—On an examina∣tion of the wound by a surgeon, he declared it to be mortal.—Would to heaven his report had been falla∣cious! but as he foretold, in a few hours, the fairest flower which earth ever saw, or heaven ever destroy∣ed,
<PB N="108" REF="032122_0112_0FF13A0CE8FB8038"/>
departed from a place where her felicity was but just begun!—Oh Providence! how unsearchable are all thy ways, when the very means that we contrive for our amusements, are thus conducive to our de∣struction? for, to add to the poignancy of this mis∣fortune, Martin was the first who, in order to amuse AEmily, had insisted on her learning to ride. How little did he then imagine the fatal consequences, which were one day doomed to attend it!—Com∣mon griefs admit of common palliative consolations; but alas, poor Martin! who shall speak comfort to af∣fliction great as thine?—in one sad hour deprived of wife—bride—mistress.—Let the Stoic, pamper'd with delicacies, from his bed of down, despise the pinching gripes attendant on poverty;—then let him smile at misfortunes, and defy their point;—but shew me the man who, when the pressing hand of stern adversity is on him, will talk thus: who when his heart is sick with grief, and his eyes dim with tears, can still preserve his resolution, and I will worship him like a descended angel.</P>

<P>The affliction of the company at Sir Thomas Har∣try's on this occasion, beggars all description. When their first shock was a little over, Sir Henry removed Mrs. Modish from a place, where every object serv∣ed but to renew her grief, by reminding her of her departed AEmily, but Martin insisted on staying there to mingle his tears with those of the whole neigh∣bourhood,
<PB N="110" REF="032122_0114_0FF12AB2F86A42C0"/>
till after her interment.—As this was too extraordinary an affair long to remain secret; the whole country were soon in tears, for the fate of the most deserving woman of her early age.—This blow added to those shocks she had lately received, had nearly been the occasion of Maria's relapse▪ but, by the friendly conversation of Charlotte, her mind was diverted from the continual contemplation of those things which occasioned her grief.</P>
<P>Time, that alleviates most sorrows, seemed but to increase that of Martin's, who now determined to re∣visit London, a month having elapsed since the bu∣rial of his AEmily; during which time, he had nev∣er fail'd daily watering her grave with his tears.—The evening before his departure, he went there alone; and having spent some time in the contem∣plation of that spot, which contained <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his rav∣ish'd soul once held dear, the following words <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> spontaneously from his lips: "Hush'd be each breeze!—ye warblers stop your throats,—for she is gone!—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he fairest flower of the creation is destroy∣ed!—Death, like an untimely frost, has nipp'd those beauties, which lately shone with such dis∣tinguish'd excellence!—I never more shall hear the music of that voice,—that form no more shall bless my longing eyes!—Lay light upon her breast, ye turf,—happier therein than I:—all nature's joyful save myself alone.—I wander insensible to all

<P>ALTHOUGH Melvill as has been before relat∣ed, had thus with the most noble resolution, hurried from the sight of that person by whom he fancied himself so much injured; yet like the famous Greek of old, he bore the fatal arrow in his heart, and in an almost distracted state, arrived at Dover just as the packet was setting sail for Calais, on which he em∣barked,

and in a few hours reached the end of his voyage, from thence proceeded with the utmost ra∣pidity to Paris, where he had not been long, before the fatigue of travelling, to which he was so unac∣customed, join'd to his uneasiness of mind about Ma∣ria, whom, however he might flatter himself, he could not so soon forget; threw him, as the reader has before heard, into a violent fever.</P>
<P>This was a most shocking situation for so young a traveller, confined to his bed in a strange place, without an acquaintance to speak to, or a friend to give him any assistance: he had just learnt French enough whilst a boy, to ask for what he wanted, but not to hold any conversation in the language; so that, if I may be allowed the expression, all the in∣tercourse he could have, was with his own thoughts, and indeed he there found full employment;—he re∣peatedly curs'd the day of his nativity, and oftner that of his first acquaintance with Maria, as all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> kindness she had hitherto shewn him, serv'd but to make her infidelity appear the stronger, and in more detestable colours; of which he sometimes deter∣mined, on his recovery to return and accuse her; but then he recollected, this would rather serve to in∣crease, than heal his wounds, for he was conscious, that she had still the firm possession of his heart, the thoughts of seeing her the wife of another, was more than he could bear.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="032122_0117_0FF13A1DC2B9B930"/>
During his illness, as his only amusement, he had recourse to reading, but not understanding French sufficiently to read in that language, and as the Eng∣lish books he there met with, were very indifferent, his studies gave him but little satisfaction:—he by chance met with the following ode, with which he was highly delighted, as being so conformable to him∣self.</P>

I was remanded to my old employment of—"a quartern o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> half a peck,"—I hope you'll remem∣ber the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Sir."—In which way of life, I con∣tinued for some time, and being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with bootless prayers to my father, that he would suffer me to vi∣sit London, now determined to wait no longer for his permission, which he still obstinately refus'd.</P>
<P>This I was urg'd to, not only from a natural de∣sire to see the world, but from having follow'd his example; in short a girl in the town was, or at least said she was with child by me, and as I had no rea∣son to doubt the truth of her assertion, I thought flight the best method to escape the officers of just∣ice, for whom I had conceiv'd a particular aversion, ever since the age of fifteen.</P>
<P>I had no sooner projected this glorious scheme, than I put it into execution, and with a small stock of cloaths, and less money, set out early one morn∣ing, without taking leave of any one except my Dul∣cienna, who with tears in her eyes, poor girl begg'd me to desist from my intention; but in vain.—I was adamant—steel—the glorious purpose of my mind was fix'd, nor was I to be diverted from it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y the prayers and entreaties of a silly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>

her course: and I was very near sinking beneath my burthen on the second. My situation was truly crit∣ical; I longed to return, but my courage forbade it; to proceed was dangerous; but as absolute necessity obliged me to fix on something, I was forced to put on the face of intrepedity, and proceed with all the strength and speed I was master of: though, not∣withstanding my utmost endeavours, I could not reach the place I had destin'd for my that night's re∣sidence; but falling short of it, at some miles dis∣tance in the skirts of a large town, just made shi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to crawl to a neighbouring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: on entering which, I was almost struck dumb with astonishment at what I saw before me. In a corner, on one poor melan∣choly truss of straw, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t a tall, genteel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh woman; in her hands she held an old scarlet coat, li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d with blue, of which she had turn'd the inside out; and was industriously trimming it with white paper, in so artful a manner, as ingenuously to conceal all the patches, which from length of time, and constant wear, were pretty numerous: near her was another wom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, more inclining to the girl, in whose face were pictur'd all the marks of vanity, nor did her action contradict my suspicions; as she was wash∣ing about ten or a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pieces of old lace, and some other ornamental trifles, which she afterwards very curiously joined <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and made into a most su∣perb head-dress, splendidly decorated with bits of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>-stone glass, &amp;c. thinly scattered to make up

a shew, to please that part of the world, whose sole ambition is to feast their sight. Not far from them on the ground, lay two men, fast lock'd in slumber, forgetting misery; and, at a little distance, sat a man and a woman; who, by the dismal light of a single solitary candle, were reading out of the same book: at the other end of the barn, was a person very busy in ornamenting and fitting up, what I af∣terwards found to be the stage, where kings and princes march'd in all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pomp; though at that time it was occupied on one side, by a cow and a calf, and on the other, by two jack asses. Notwith∣standing I had seen so very little of the world, I did not want to be informed, that these were a company of strolling commedians, preparing for their next night <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> task. In a supplicating tone I told them my story, and begg'd leave to take up my lodging there for one night; they very humanely granted my re∣quest; and having refreshed me in a sparing man∣ner on bread and cheese, directed me to a vacant corner of the barn, where I lay down; and overcome with my excessive fatigue, soon fell a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leep: in which happy state I had been some hours, when I was awaked by a person crying in a hoarse voice <HI>Why, this is well—this is blow for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>—Where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>!</HI> interrupted I, rising in a fright <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> body was fighting, and that this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> was thus ex∣pressing his approbation of it: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they soon con∣vinc'd me of my error, by informing me, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mr.

Rantum was only rehearsing the part of Zanga, in the Revenge; which play was to be perform'd that even∣ing, as the written bills specified, by a company of performers from the theatre royal.</P>
<P>As I was naturally of a vollatile disposition, the drollery and variety of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> peoples lives pleas'd me so much, that I longed to become one of them; and therefore informed them, that I should be glad to be engaged as a person, willing to do every thing in his power; and having in a short time agreed on the terms, I was in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olled one of the company, with all the usual forms. Agreeable to their design, the Re∣venge was that evening performed, with universal applause: the characters were, in general, what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> call, well supported; but Zanga in particular, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mr. Rantum play'd, to the admiration of those who seemed to understand him, and the utter astonish∣ment of those who did not: he had formerly been at London, in Drury <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Theatre, where he was employed in the characters of footmen, guards, &amp;c. and I am even credibly informed, that he once play'd the part of a bear in a pantomine; but be that as it may, it is certain that he still retained so high an o∣pinion of the London actors, that he copied one of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> very minutely in he character of Zanga, as some crit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s said, and rear'd so very loud, that he did not thoroughly recover his speech for three days af∣terwards.</P>

There now opened to me fresh scenes every day, of which I had not before, as indeed how should I, the least idea. To recount to you the various in∣trigues that now presented themselves, especially the amorous advances of Mrs. Faintwell, who took pains to inform me, that every young man who had a mind to succeed, should form a connection with some lady of merit in the company; it would perhaps appear the effect of vanity, though most certainly Mrs. Faintwell, who was old enough to be my mother, and who had possessed eight real or nominal hus∣bands, absolutely proposed going by my name, that we might live, and taste the sweets, without the in∣convenience of matrimony:—to tell also the vari∣ous shifts we were obliged to make, in the perform∣ance of our pieces, would appear romance; however, we gained considerable applause where ever we went—I say we, because I belonged to the company;—though hitherto I had done nothing more than sweep the stage, snuff the can l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, swell'd the train of a the∣atric prince, and walked in a white shoat at Juliet's funeral procession <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pin'd with envy, at seeing the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> other's met with, while I, with my shining talents remained in dismal obscurity.—However, conscious of my own abilities, I began to think to appear in some more elevated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; and accordingly consulted Mr. Rantum; of whom, before I proceed, it may be proper to say something—the property of some daubed canvass, and tarnish'd
<PB N="122" REF="032122_0126_0FF13A3CA60E0CD8"/>
tinsel cloaths, so much increased the natural pride of this important person that he considered and used the members of his company as slaves; thieves to the men, and expressions equally gross to the wo∣men, were common with him; and a very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣gree of contradiction could rouse him to real knock∣down arguments with his fist; supposing himself the best actor upon earth, he could not bear the least ap∣pearance of a slight; which occasioned him once in the character of Alexander, to deprive Hephestion of a tooth, for supposing he laughed at him; he was as selfish as proud, and took care, eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> when there was tolerable success, to glean so much, under pre∣tence of stock-debt, that the company were very lit∣tle above begging; which occasioned them to be ve∣ry comical in tragedy and sad in commedy.</P>
<P>Upon application to our managers, he readily granted my request: desiring to know what I chose to come out in. Being naturally of an aspiring dis∣position, and not in the least doubting my tragical powers, I had pre-resolved, like the sun from behind an obscuring cloud, to break forth more glorious, for having been thus concealed; and therefore pitched upon Jachimo, for my first attempt: Mr. Rantum said, that I knew Cymbeline to be a play for which they were not at all prepared: and which would in∣evitably put them to great inconveniences in the performance; but that having conceived a regard for
<PB N="123" REF="032122_0127_0FF13A41AF2B93A8"/>
me, he would oblige me by having it represented; and as an additional proof <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> play Leonatus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>osthumus.—The parts therefore were accordingly cast, and Mr. Rantum very kindly gave me some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, relative to my attitudes, voice, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In less than a fortnight we were all ready for the rehearsal: and the bills gave notice of " Cymbeline to be performed, the part of Jachimo by a young gentleman, being his first appearance on any stage."</P>
<P>This, of course filled the treatre, alias the barn, with all the neighbouring families: and as the fatal hour drew nigh, when all my future fame was to be laid at stake, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elt myself in a situation not to be described.—The warning bell at length ringing—I appeared, and the house re-echoed with applause:—I went through the first act as well as could be ex∣pected; but when I stole an inestimable bracelet of black ribbond from Imogen's arm, who was reposed on a white sheet, laid over the skeleton box used in pantomime: the success <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> with, was inexpressi∣ble, beyond my most sanguine expectations: her bed-chamber indeed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> answer that ini∣matable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> by the immortal Shakespeare: the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> silver'd silk, proud Cleopatra <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Roman, but the patch work of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> from en∣quiring eyes, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> describing the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="124" REF="032122_0128_0FF13A44C81A47A0"/>
thus you see we endeavoured to come as near the o∣riginal as possible; and our audience being kind enough, to take the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll for the deed, the whole went off with an uncommon eclat.</P>
<P>And give me leave to observe, that till within these two years, when the managers of Covent Gar∣den, have very judiciously had one painted on pur∣pose; I have frequently known a scene exhibited in this excellent play, which had no more resemblance to the description given of it, in the subsequent act, than that which our itinerant company was obliged to make use of: necessity indeed was plea sufficient for them; but surely at the theatres royal, it is so great an absurdity, and so glaring an affront offered to the understanding of the public, as scarcely to be overlooked, or forgiven by any audience: for when we hear those beautiful lines:
<Q><L>—It was hang'd</L>
<L>With tapestry of silver'd silk; the story</L>
<L>Proud Cleopatra, when she met her Roman,</L>
<L>And Cyndus swell'd above the banks, or for</L>
<L>The press of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oats, or pride, a piece of work</L>
<L>So bravely done, so rich, that it did strive,</L>
<L>In workmanship and value; which I wonder'd</L>
<L>Could be so rarely, and exactly wrought,</L>
<L>Since the true life on't was—</L>
<BIBL>CYMBELINE;</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>I say Sir, when we hear this glorious and animated description, we naturally refer our ideas, to the scene
<PB N="125" REF="032122_0129_0FF13A46B7BB8078"/>
of which it is spoken: but which upon recollection, we shall find, was something ridiculously trifling, and foreign to the purpose: but to proceed—in the bat∣tle scene, I gained great honor, when struck with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of a guilty conscience; my nerveless arm refus'd its office, and obliged me to yield to Posthu∣mus, his Romish weeds disguis'd by a carter's frock; but at the conclusion, I will not say I deserved, but I will venture to assure you, that I was loaded with vast applause; the men approved, and the women said I was quite a charming creature: which to do Mr. Rantum justice, I must attribute to his teaching me the full use of my lungs, which were naturally strong, dismissed me with their echoing hands.</P>
<P>Thus you see, on what trifling, insignificant points, depends the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame of an actor, whose profession is, of all others, the most arduous and uncertain.</P>
<P>As I succeeded so happily in my first attempt, you may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> I did not stop there; and thinking no doubt, that my comic powers, were equally good with my tragic: I determined my next appearance should be in comedy; when fixing on Sir Harry Beagle, in the Jealous Wife, for my <HI>coup d'essai,</HI> came off as well as I had done in Jachimo; though to do my audience justice, I must own, that here for once in their lives, they were pleas'd with, and gave due praise to simple nature; for having been bred in a stable the greatest part of my life, the smack of
<PB N="126" REF="032122_0130_0FF13A4BB2A57440"/>
my whip, which alone gain'd me great applause, had from constant custom, become so habitual, that very little art was requir'd to support the character in a forcible manner.</P>
<P>Not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> take up too much of your time. I appeared in a variety of characters, and by an attention to such trifling particulars, gain'd all the applause I wish'd for, and much more than I really deserv'd; however, entering into a quarrel to support the consequence of my old lady, who at the age of fifty-six, with a most corpulent figure, wanted to play Juliet, and other girlish parts: Mr. Rantum and I decided the matter by a bruising match, in which I came off victorious, but the vanquish'd manager took his revenge by dis∣charging me, and being hissed out of every company I afterwards attempted, it became necessary to accept the place of valet de chambre to a gentleman who was coming over to Paris: and where I had no doubt of finding employment; but being discharg∣ed by my master for attending the comedy instead of him; to my great mortification, I am now con∣vinc'd, that the French encourage no poor but their own; which has obliged me thus to offer my servi∣ces to you, Sir, and by a pretty thorough knowledge of that great city, I hope to prove myself very use∣ful.</P>

<P>OUR burlesque theatric hero, having finished his narrative; Melvill engaged him as a kind of guide, during his stay at Paris, which was about three weeks, but prudently considering him as one of those who knew too much of low life to be trusted, dismiss∣ed him on setting out for the capital of Spain; on his arrival at Madrid, our disconted traveller hired lodgings in ane of the most capital streets, and by frequenting all public places soon contracted a larger sphere of acquaintance than Spanish reserve, especial∣ly to foreigners, seemed to admit; however, he a∣voided any particular intimacy except with Don Carios, who was the only son of a grandee and of one
<PB N="4" REF="032122_0133_0FF13A54ADA25F80"/>
of the most respectable families in that kingdom.—This young gentleman was about two and twenty years of age, handsome in person, elegant in appear∣ance, modest in behaviour and undaunted in danger, constant in friendship, sensible charitable and gene∣rous: No wonder that with these qualifications Mel∣vill and he contracted a sympathetic and mutual es∣teem for each other, which in a short time grew into the most disinterested friendship.</P>
<P>Don Pelajo, the name of Don Carlos's father, had formerly been in the wars, where he had distinguish∣ed himself much for his bravery; he was judicious, brave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> prudent: polite and affable to those who were acquainted with him, but to strangers appeared to have the national haughtiness stamped upon his deportment; yet even then he rather created respect than disgust, he ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ried when very young, but inhe∣riting rather too much of the Spanish jealousy, his wife led not the happiest life, and left him at the age of twenty nine, a widower with two children, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> a son and a daughter, what the former was, the reader has already heard, I will now, as near as I am able, draw the picture of his daughter Juliana; who when Melvill first saw her, was about eighteen years of age. Her size of a delicate medium, her complexion so beautiful that had it not been the same from her youth, malicious scandal, would have said it was ar∣tificial, her person was genteel, her hair and eye∣brows
<PB N="5" REF="032122_0134_0FF13A587866B498"/>
of a beautiful brown, the former curling in ringlets, over her ivory neck, seemed like a gorge∣ous net, to entrap the heart of all beholders, the latter formed two exact bows over her large blue eyes, which very few dared to look on twice, and her teeth, to borrow an expression from a favourite au∣thor, were like polished ivory set in a coral bed.—These personal accomplishments, joined to a good natural understanding, much improved by art, made the lovely Juliana, the most accomplished young lady in Madrid.</P>
<P>Such were the father and daughter to whom Don Carlos introduced Melvill as one of his most parti∣cular friends, such was the family by which our he∣ro was much caressed, and in whose acquaintance he thought himself extremely happy.</P>
<P>Don Pelajo gave him a general invitation to his house, which to rid himself of those disagreeable thoughts concerning Maria, that he knew would in∣trude upon solitude, he co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dially accepted and made almost constant use of: Don Carlos and he were scarce ever asunder, as instead of calling each other, every time they met, gave an additional satisfaction to both, always finding that reciprocal satisfaction when together, which sensible men must meet with in conversing with persons of equal knowledge</P>
<P>Though in their intercourses Melvill thought him∣self
<PB N="6" REF="032122_0135_0FF13A5BCB8C3510"/>
happy, still there was a certain <HI>Je ne scais quoi</HI> in his countenance, that plainly shewed he was not so; Don Carlos could not avoid observing this un∣easiness; the real cause of which the reader knows; and with all the tenderness of affection, insisted on being acquainted therewith: Melvill could refuse no∣thing to so dear a friend, and therefore informing him of the affair concluded with a determined resolution to forget her, in which he was not a little strengthened by the salutary advice of his second self, for so he frequently called Don Carlos.</P>
<P>Juliana, though young, had received several off∣ers from men of leading family and fortune, but con∣scious that her own estate must one day be very con∣siderable, she thought herself thereby endowed with an undoubted right, to please herself in so momentu∣ous a choice; at least such were the arguments her own mind furnished her with, to paliate what many deemed imprudence, though the real truth was no other, than that her time was not yet come, she had yet never seen any one for whom she felt a tender partiality, but alas! of how short a duration was her enjoyment of this pleasing indifference; for on her first introduction to Melvill, she was seized with a sensation her heart had hitherto been an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> stranger to, her spirits were so fluttered and her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> was so disordered, that it was with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> made any return to the many compliments which he paid her, and although when he took his
<PB N="7" REF="032122_0136_0FF13A605EBE48F8"/>
leave, her head was so disturbed, with the thoughts of this English stranger, as totally to destroy her nights rest, still young and unskilled in all the arts of love, she could assign no reason for the unusual pal∣pitation of her heart; though her eyes always spark∣led with an additional satisfaction when in his com∣pany, and as very few days passed in which she had not this pleasure; love had made a great progress in her affections, before she knew it by any other name, than that of "regard for so dear a friend of her brother's."</P>
<P>Admiring and admired, our hero would have been completely happy, had not that felicity, as I before said, been destroyed by the thoughts of the seeming∣ly perfidious Maria, who, in spite of himself, was always the subject of his private meditations, and al∣though to all outward appearance, he seemed per∣fectly easy and composed, still he pined inwardly, and would frequently exclaim, "Wretch that I am, why was I ever fool enough to declare my passion for a worthless woman, who must now laugh and de∣spise me for my folly? Dissembling hypocrite! thus cruelly at one blow to blast my happiness for ever, just too when I had figured to myself prospects of fe∣licity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> many years to come; as an additional mi∣sery must I still be doomed to doat upon a woman, who in open violation of truth and honour, has, after the most solemn promises, devoted herself to another.
<PB N="8" REF="032122_0137_0FF13A62ADC6A890"/>
No! since she has thus forfeited my esteem, I can, or must endeavour to banish her from my thoughts."</P>

<P>WHILE he was thus one day railing against the unfortunate Maria, Don Carlos, who through a slight partition had heard all he said, unexpectedly entered the room, and taking his hand in the most affectionate manner, "Indeed said he, my dear friend this must not be, you promised to drive this English beauty from your mind, and from your seeming tran∣quility and composure, I flattered myself you had succeeded, remember Henry, those wounds heal ill, which men do give themselves.</P>
<P>"Oh Don Carloss! interrupted he, I had as you say resolved to forget her, and firmly meant to keep my resolutions, but alas! I find that I am unequal to the task, that I have imposed upon myself—must I confess to you, that I am not master of my own in∣tents

—that once▪ amiable girl has such an ascenden∣cy over me; that one thought of her destroys the noblest purposes of my soul.—I cannot live with∣out her, and as fate has cruelly thus placed her be∣yond my reach—my final infelicity is sealed.</P>
<P>"For shame, for shame! cried Don Carlos, have you no sense of honor or resentment of so deep an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.—What! when a woman has used you so shamefully—still to entertain a passion for her—rouse yourself and be in reality the man you seem; consid∣er, if the false ungrateful idol of your hearts, by her ill usage cannot provoke you to a retaliation, yet con∣sider I beseech you how criminal it is both in reli∣gion and honor to cherish a passion for another man's wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.

<P>"Yes, cried Melvill, I am convinced—I see the justness of your arguments, and am resolved, hence∣forth to abandon every consideration of Oak Hall.—Allons, let us attend your father, who by this time waits for us."</P>

His friend having bowed assent, he proceeded as follows:</P>

<P>THE next time our two friends were alone, Don Carlos resumed his discourse from the former chapter.</P>
<P>Conscious, said he, that your affections, were al∣ready pre-engaged, though on an undeserving object, I endeavoured to persuade my sister to think no more of you, and to encourage her thereto, have, for which I hope you will pardon me, broken the sacred bond of friendship; by informing her of your unhappy at∣tatchment to Maria, though but in part, as I did not mention any thing of her being already married, on∣ly assuring her, that your whole heart was fixed on a young lady in England.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="032122_0142_0FF13A75A881B870"/>
Like you my Henry, she was too much in love to hear reason, and it was in vain, that I urged a fa∣vourite sentiment of her own to induce her to forget you—they never knew to love who knew to change.—I in vain asked her what she should think of you, were you thus dishonourable to transfer your affec∣tions from one to the other, it all signified nothing.—But as you must, from fatal experience, know the difficulty of overcoming a misplaced affection, better than I can pretend to inform you; I will say no more upon the subject.—In short, she insisted on my declaring it to you, which as she had been candid enough to confess it, I could not refuse; nor could I break my word with her, without adding thereto, the more flagrant crime of falsehood. I have also, as I though it my duty, informed my father of this affair, who would most joyfully accept of you for a son in law; I need not surely add, what I hope you are already convinced of, that I should be highly pleased to join the more endearing name of brother, to that of friend—but I fear it will never be—all that I can now add, is, that I am sorry poor Juliana' happiness depends upon your answer, as I think, I too plainly read it in your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>While Don Carlos was thus speaking, Melvill stood in the greatest perplexity, undetermined what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> reply, but finding his friend was waiting for an an∣swer, as the only resource, he begged some time to
<PB N="14" REF="032122_0143_0FF13A7A21C02AD0"/>
consider of so friendly a proposal and promised to in∣form him of his resolution, in writing the ensuing day, after which, they hurried to their usual gay com∣panions, whose vivacity however was not able to efface the gloom, which the above conversation had spread upon Melvill's countenance; and when he retired to his bed, it was without the least inclina∣tion to sleep.</P>
<P>He lay ruminating the greatest part of the night on the business of the subsequent day, so delightful a prospect was not easily renounced.—A beautiful vir∣tuous young lady with an immense fortune, were strong temptations for a man in his circumstances, so very ill used too by that woman where he had garnered up his heart.—All these, were great incite∣ments to him to resolve to abandon Maria for ever and marry Juliana; but then the thoughts of enter∣ing into such an engagement, when he was convinc∣ed how firmly his affections were otherwise fixed; wounded his conscience as a man of honour and in∣tegrity, far too sensibly to suffer him to commit so base an action.</P>
<P>After a long and violent conflict; he determined to make this sacrifice to Maria; in which he was not a little strengthened, by the first gleam of hope that he had entertained since his departure, and which shot across his mind presenting her to his view in her original simplicity and virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="032122_0144_0FF13A7D5C57CC60"/>
Oh the axtatic thought! but alas! it was but the glimmering of a transient ray, which even the most wretched will sometimes entertain; and which like the burning taper's light, will be the most apparent, where our darkness and despair are in the extreme.</P>
<P>A drowning man will catch at every straw. How∣ever be that as it may, it fixed him firmly in her fa∣vour, and he had the satisfactory consciousness of having acted right, and in consequence thereof wrote the next morning as follows.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR CARLOS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE honour you intend me, by an alliance to your family, calls for my warmest and most grateful acknowledgments; permit me, therefore, to assure you, that I shall always regard it, as a pleasing testi∣mony of your friendship and esteem; though, at the same time, I must entreat you so excuse me, if for several reasons, I beg leave to decline your friendly offer; for altho' I know no family, of whose affinity I should be more proud, having a great value for Don Pelajo and yourself; and a most sincere regard for the lovely Juliana; still, as a great deal beyond esteem is necessary to render the marriage state hap∣py, and, as by my affections being otherwise unfor∣tunately placed, your sister will be deprived of that love which every man ought to have for his wife; I cannot be base enough, from the paltry con∣sideration

of money, or the supposed spirit of re∣venge, to make a worthy woman unhappy, by giv∣ing her my hand without my heart.</P>
<P>I must therefore wish the generous Juliana, all the felicity this world can afford, with some more de∣serving man:—but, lest my presence should be fuel to her unhappy passion, I will in a few days remove from Madrid, that absence may help to effect her cure.</P>
<P>Believe me to be, dear Carlos, much shocked at a separation from such estimable society; allow me to have a due sense of the honour and happiness intend∣ed me; and view me as one, who will always be proud to subscribe himself,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>On receipt of the above, Don Carlos hastened to his friend, to thank him for his kind and prudent in∣tentions, with regard to quitting Madrid; and, at the same time, insisted on his giving up all thoughts thereof: "as, added he, it cannot answer no end, Juliana being in a few days going to spend some months with a relation in the country; you must therefore absent yourself from my father's till then; and, in the mean time, I'll inform her of your ans∣wer."—which he accordingly did.</P>

of her hopes and wishes heroically; and only repli∣ed, "Altho' so painful to me, I cannot but applaud his fidelity to some more happy woman;—may she be deserving of him! and though I can never be happy, I may perhaps learn contentment."</P>
<P>The time had slipp'd away <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o agreeably, during our hero's stay at Madrid, that he had already been there much longer than he at first intended; and, at the earnest request of his Spanish friends, now wrote to Mr. Howard, to inform him of his intention of residing there some weeks longer; but that, as it would not be long enough for him to hear from Eng∣land, he should not subjoin, his address. Tho' this was mere matter of opinion as it was morally impos∣sible, that he could give any tolerably exact guess at the duration of his stay there, he did it on purpose that he might hear nothing of Maria, whom he now flatter'd himself, he was in a fair way of forgetting.</P>
<P>Vain man! when once affection's rooted in the breast, 'tis not the dictates of reason, the immensity of distance, or the grave remarks of frigid prudence, which can remove it!—Had he not taken this unac∣countable whim into his head, his felicity might soon have been completed, by having the still un∣married Maria in his arms:—but Mr. Howard be∣ing thus excluded from any possibility of writing to him, happiness and he seemed as widely distant, as

<P>HAPPY in so faithful a friend as Charlotte How∣ard to sympathize with her in all her afflictions, after the first tumults of her grief, which AEmily's death had occasioned, were in some degree subsided, Ma∣ria began again to indulge those melancholy reflec∣tions that Melvill's departure had occasioned. With the heart felt tortures of an unaffected sorrow, she lamented his absence:—she grieved for him, 'tis true: but then that grief was allay'd, by sometimes hearing of his welfare from Mr. Howard; by the consolatory reflections, that he must one day return: that when he found his error, his former love would
<PB N="19" REF="032122_0148_0FF13A8C784A3F70"/>
revive, with an additional ardour, for having been thus suppressed; and by the consideration that they might then be happy, in an union that was no longer opposed by the harsh commands of an austere parent—on the contrary, Sir Thomas endeavoured all he could to make her forget his former ill usage;—he was continually inventing new pleasures, to divert her from that melancholy, which the quick succes∣sion of two such unfortunate accidents had given her a turn to: nor was his endeavours wholly unsuccess∣ful; her former serenity of mind and countenance began, in some measure, to return, to the unspeaka∣ble joy of her over fond parents;—she again began to be the sprightly Maria Hartry;—dutiful to her parents; obligingly good natured to all who knew her;—beloved by the whole country:—and from the above considerations, possessed a tolerable degree of happiness, when another unforeseen acci∣dent happened to deprive her of it; which altho it is what every one must meet with, some time or other, was nevertheless very unexpected at that period;—being no other than the death of Sir Thomas, after a few days illness.</P>
<P>Maria felt this loss the more severely, as her fa∣ther's fondness for her seemed every day to increase; having as it were, had her restored to his arms, from the mouth of the all devouring grave: we may therefore reasonably conclude, that with a heart pos∣sessed
<PB N="20" REF="032122_0149_0FF13A8E395B22D0"/>
of extreme sensibility, her grief for the loss of so good a parent, would be almost immoderate: but being a natural affliction, no one attempted to re∣strain it.</P>
<P>Lady Hartry was much too good a woman, not to be sensibly concern'd for the loss of a man who had been united to her by the tender ties of wedlock: neither could she be supposed to feel the same de∣gree of sorrow for him, as if their lives had been one continued round of harmonious concord, which no one can imagine to be the case; as her's was rather a match of obedience to the inclinations of others, than from any choice of her own: but

<P>On the death of Sir Thomas, Mr. Howard and Charlotte, removed to Oak-Hall; that by their com∣pany and conversation, they might support the drooping spirits of the widow and her daughter.—On opening the will of the deceased, they found that he had left the whole of his estate to his only son Charles Hartry, in case he should ever return to own it; out of which, he was to pay the undermentioned legacies; to his mother, lady Hartry, during her life, the sum of one thousand pounds annually; to his
<PB N="21" REF="032122_0150_0FF13A9544C60008"/>
sister, twenty thousand pounds on demand; to Charlotte and Melvill, each one thousand pounds; leaving it, as his last desire, that the latter on his re∣turn, should marry Maria; and to Mr. Howard, whom he appointed his executor, for his trouble therein, two thousand pounds; but, in case his son should not return, he bequeath'd his estate to his wife, on the same conditions: and after her death, to his daughter Maria; who now finding herself in pos∣session of an ample independency, determined to of∣fer it to Melvill, on his return; for which having waited for some months, with great patience, and no sign thereof appearing, she again began to relapse in∣to her former melancholy; which Mr. Howard perceiving, proposed to lady Hartry, in order to diversify the scene, a journey to Bath; saying, that himself and Charlotte would accompany them.</P>
<P>In hopes of re-establishing her daughter's health, that was visibly declining, she readily agreed to this proposal; and they, in a few days, accordingly set out on their journey. Maria was pleased at leaving a place, where every object serv'd but to remind her of the many happy days she had formerly spent there nor was her joy a little increased, by the heart-felt satisfaction of being accompanied by her dear Cha∣lotte: however not to be troublesomely minute, I shall pass over the particulars of their journey, and proceed to that time when they were safely lodged on the parade at Bath.</P>

A few nights after their arrival, they went to the rooms, when as is usual on the appearance of any new faces, a buzzing whisper ran round the company—such as, <HI>who are they? when did they come? where do they lodge? the youngest is amazing handsome?</HI> and many other remarks, equally curious and imper∣tinent, which all people think custom has given them an undoubted right to make, on the appearance of strangers.

<P>CHARLOTTE being an unusual smart girl, soon engaged a partner for the evening; and Maria had not been long seated, before Lord Dapperwit advancing in a minuet step, with a pert, though gen∣teel air, begg'd the honor of her hand, which she as politely refused; adding, that she did not intend dancing that evening.</P>
<P>With any other man th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Lord Dapperwit, here the conversation would of course have dropped; but he with a polite effrontery replied, that he had come to the rooms with the same intention; but on seeing so amiable a lady, could not deny himself the satisfac∣tion o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> asking her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; but since she was not incli∣ned to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o him th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> fav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, begg'd he might have the honor of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by her: she nodded assent, and my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> his place accordingly. Before I proceed, it may not be improper to give some further account of this nobleman, who being possessed of a very large
<PB N="24" REF="032122_0153_0FF13A9C2BE13338"/>
estate, thought himself thereby qualified to do whate∣ver he plesed; which pleasure his lordship once car∣ried so far, as very narrowly to escape being run thro' the body, for pleasing to be insolently rude to a la∣dy, whose cause a gentleman in company chose to espouse, and called his lordship to a pretty severe ac∣count for his behaviour; nor was this the only scrape he got into, by the invariable disposition of doing whatever he had a mind to, because he had money: but he looked upon them all as actions worthy a buck, in which ideal character it was the height of his ambition to shine.</P>
<P>Being of course a pattern of pertness and affectation, this entirely obscured his natural parts, which were, in themselves, far from contemptible; and, in proper hands, might have been made use of to the establish∣ment of a commendable character: he likewise tho't himself very witty, always endeavouring to appear so, by abusing every body he saw, whether he knew them or not, in what he called a pleasant vein of hu∣mour; which only served to render him in the eyes of all sensib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e people more thoroughly ridiculous: for it was as Churchil says,
<Q><L>—Aiming at wit, tho' levell'd in the dark.</L></Q></P>
<P>Hearing himself talk, right or wrong, was the height of his ambition; he was, in short, what is gen∣erally understood "by a polite man of quality;" that
<PB N="25" REF="032122_0154_0FF13AA228FD06D8"/>
is to say, he was a mean sharper at Arthur's.—a frantic buck at the Thatch'd House—a numscull politician at the Cocoa Tree—and a coxcomb every where; and though no one was more exactly con∣stant in running the rapid and tedious circle of po∣lite pleasures; yet his love for gaming was by far the most predominant passion, he contrived to allot the greatest part of his time to the indulgence of that passion: and as Bath is perfectly calculated to prose∣cute such a scheme he generally attended there every season, to impose on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he ignorant, with some of those tricks, which his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in town, from being as wise as himself, could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e taken in by: and indeed this was his business in the rooms at that time: but Maria unluckily happening to strike his view, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e determined to ask her to dance, which he did in the urgent manner above related.</P>
<P>He was no sooner seated, than he began to ask sev∣eral familiar questio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s;—as, how long she had been at Bath?—how she lik'd it?—how long she propo∣sed s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aying?—with many others equally trifling and it significant: to all which Maria answered with the greatest complacence and good nature.</P>
<P>The conversation had for some time stopped when she unhappily at once gave him an opportunity of resuming <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and displayed his satirical <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, by inadvertently asking, if he knew who the gentleman was, that was then dancing a minuet?</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="032122_0155_0FF13AA3DFC6AC90"/>
"O! that madam, said he, is, <HI>entre nous,</HI> as errant a rascal as ever liv'd; I never heard his name;—but am perfectly acquainted with his character, which is all I desire to know of him; for he is a fellow whom no-body chooses to be seen with.—He is worth money▪ which he gets in London by stock-jobbing, and comes down to Bath every year to spend it, by setting up for a beau;—but you see madam, he has not the true natural air,—it is all stu∣died,—all affected; he moves as aukwardly, as if he never had a lac'd coat on before;—a perfect pup∣pet on wires;—like the print of grown gentlemen taught to dance,—ha! ha! ha!"</P>
<P>"Do you see that lady in the mazarine blue and silver sack?—she, madam, was no more than a milliner's apprentice in Tavistock street, when Sir Henry Rattle took her into his good graces."—Thus was this popinjay running on, abusing people, with∣out one word of truth, and many whom he had nev∣er before seen, as an amusement for a young lady of sense, above scandal; thinking that, as with most others of his acquaintance, he could thus chatter him∣self into her good graces.</P>
<P>With what justice may the rigid moralists of the age exclaim against so shocking a prostitution, both of time and words! and yet is it not amazing, that though every body seems convinced of the truth hereof, they should all be encouragers of

to prattle an infinity of small talk, or rather nothing, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>return to which, she scarcely spoke ten words the whole evening; so that though they were together, he could hardly be said to enjoy her company.</P>
<P>Quite harrass'd with this coxcomb's importunity, as her only resource, tho' it was then early, she de∣termined to leave the rooms; which resolution she communicated to her mother, who was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ards; at the same time informing her of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, as she likewise did her friend Charlotte: when my lord, from over-hearing a few words, guessing what was her design, insisted on attending her home: and she as strongly insisted that he should not, however, he was much too well bred a gentleman to take any denial, and all her remonstrances would have signi∣fied but little, had not an intimate, of my lord's such another as himself, luckily at that instant, laid hold of his button, to tell him some important gambling event, during which lucky interim, Maria made her escape, inwardly pleas'd, as she then thought, thus to have got rid of so troublesome a puppy; but alas! it prov'd far otherwise; for when my lord perceiv'd that she was gone, without his having been able to find out her place of residence, he began abusing the person who had thus stopped him.</P>
<P>"I wish Mellifont, said he, with all my heart, you had been at the devil, ere I'd met you; for I have
<PB N="29" REF="032122_0158_0FF13AAE5088F8A0"/>
been in company the whole evening with the sweet∣est girl upon earth, and now your d—'d unlucky face has prevented me from finding out where she lodges; she has given me the slip as I live.—Egad she is a delicate morsel, and I would not loose her for five hundred pounds."</P>
<P>"Oh, is that all, answered his friend, don't let such a trifle give you any uneasiness, for, in the com∣mon course of things, no girl in Bath can be con∣ceal'd from me many days;—but here, I can at once put you into a sure method of discovering her:—she seems intimate with the lady, meaning Charlotte▪ that is dancing with Sir Thomas Atwell, who will most assuredly wait on his partner tomorrow; it will therefore be the easiest thing in life, by only speaking to him, to gain some further particulars concerning her."</P>
<P>"You have nick'd it, my dear boy, replies his lordship, and then, my buck."—</P>
<P>"And then, what! interrupted Mellifont, why, surely you can have no design to metamorphose your∣self, from the gay lord Dapperwit, into a sober, sedate husband."—</P>
<P>"Husband! re echoed his lordship, <HI>pardonnez moy,</HI> no such intentions, on the word of a gentleman,—the farthest thing in the world from my thoughts;—oh <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <HI>burgeois.</HI>—Matrimony indeed!—no, no, I have

<P>The reader must by this time perceive what were this nobleman's intentions, with regard to Maria; he made no doubt, but that it would be an easy mat∣ter for a person of his figure and consequence, to do what he pleas'd with a silly, credulous girl, for with him every girl was such; he therefore made it his business to wait on Charlotte's partner the next day, and from him learnt all that he desired to know con∣cerning Maria▪ and though he was not a little pleas∣ed at this discovery, yet at the same time he began to consider, that as she was a girl of fortune and knowledge, he should meet with more difficulty in the execution of his scheme, than he was at first a∣ware of; and as he saw no probability of ever bring∣ing it to perfection, was on the point of resolving to give up all further thoughts thereof, when Mellifont, according to appointment, entered the room; but as this gentleman, will in all likelihood, cut no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> figure in this part of the history, I must beg <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

<P>MR. MELLIFONT was the youngest son of a gentleman in Shropshire, and therefore of course, he could not be suppos'd to have fortune sufficient to enable him to live independent of the world: this being the case, he was placed out in the capacity of a clerk in one of the most capital mercantile-houses <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> London, the regularity of which life, did not suit the gaiety of the young gentleman's disposition; who finding the air of the city too heavy for his constitu∣tion, made frequent excursions to the other end of the town, and was sometimes absent from his business a week together, for which, on his return, he was al∣ways severely reprimanded by his master; but these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, instead of producing any amendment, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to heighten his dislike to the counting-house;
<PB N="32" REF="032122_0161_0FF13AB9D86CF1E8"/>
he was therefore rarely seen in it, but com∣mencing at once the petit maitre and fine gentleman, (characters, which too many young men are ambi∣tious of attaining) took lodgings near Covent Gar∣den, and wasted his time in what is commonly call'd a continual round of pleasure, or in other words, of noisy debauchery, and profligate excess.</P>
<P>As it was very well known, that on the death of his father, he must come into four thousand pounds, which had been settled on him by his grandmother, he found people enough ready to advance him mo∣ney, at an exorbitant interest.</P>
<P>In this manner did he live, contracting debts on the strength of his future fortune, never once con∣sidering, that he was spending it, without the enjoy∣ment, or even possession thereof:—buried in vices and obscenity, the recollection of which, in his cool∣er moments, fill'd him with inexpressible anguish; for every man must sometimes think, ruining his constitution, and vitiating his principles, to say no∣thing of his continual fears lest he should be arrested by some of those people whom he had disappointed in promising them payment; but as he never gave himself time or trouble to think seriously, for any continuance, these things could make but a moment∣ary impression on him.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="032122_0162_0FF13ABBD0ABE9F0"/>
He continued in this course of life for nea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> four years, during which time, he contracted a nume∣rous acquaintance among people of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame stamp with himself, on all of whom he pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s'd himself for a man of fortune; and, under this character, gain'd something from most of them, that is to say, he learnt convenience from pick-pockets and sharpers, cring∣ing from pimps, audacity from bullies, and the noble <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of contrivance from prostitutes: under which five heads, we shall conclude the whole circle of his acquaintance: he was now in continual axpectation of his father's death, which at length happened; not a little hastened by his favourite sons behaviour, to whom he had frequently represented the unavoidable consequences of such proceedings, but in vain:—pleasure was the object of his pursuit, nor did he care at how dear a rate he purchased it, though were by the death of an indulgent parent.</P>
<P>This happy time once arrived, he came immedi∣ately into the possession of his long expected fortune, and notwithstanding he had been pre acquainted with the exact sum, was amazed to find himself much poorer than he was aware of; for, after hav∣ing paid the money he had borrowed, with the inte∣rest thereof, his taylor, hosier, &amp;c. out of the four thousand he had received, he found himself in actu∣al possession of but five hundred; a good stock <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>loaths, and some little dear bought experience.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="032122_0163_0FF13AC24A477458"/>
He now, for once in his life, began to think seri∣ously; he considered, that at the rate he went on, he should soon see the end of his five hundred pounds; and as necessity is the mother of invention, began to look out for some method whereby he might in∣crease it; when only two presenting themselves to his fancy, namely, either to buy a share in some shop with the money he then had, or else continue in the state of a fine gentleman, and by persuading some rich widow or heiress, for once in THEIR lives, to step into a hir'd carriage, thereby be enabled to ride in his own, for the rest of HIS; he was not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>long in determining upon the latter, which was far the most agreeable to his inclinations; and from his great skill in the art of imposition, had so far brought his scheme to bear, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be on the point of running away with a young <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, on whom he had palm'd him▪ himself for a nobleman of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, when the pry∣ing officiousness of his intended lady's chamber∣maid, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> his title was borrow'd, and that all his estate, and of course his gentility, consisted in a lac'd coa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a large stock of impudence, the latter of which qualifications he stood greatly in need of, to extricate himself from the affair.</P>
<P>Thus by an unexpected blast, were all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his future felicity destroyed, just when he had brought them to the summit of perfection; and as he now found it would be impossible to put his
<PB N="35" REF="032122_0164_0FF13AC4112BACF8"/>
scheme into execation in London, he hurried down to Bath on the same errand, where he became per∣sonally acquainted with Lord Dapperwit, who was before by no means ignorant of his name or profes∣sion, though for reasons best known to himself, he had chose to conceal them from Maria; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>indeed this was the gentleman whom he had represented as a stock-jobber.</P>
<P>One would imagine that this nobleman must re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive a peculiar pleasure in thus considering people in characters which they had no right to, as it was his constant practice, and which, as he valued himself very much upon it, he sometimes facetiously, and not improperly term'd, a masquerade in the mind's eye.</P>
<P>But to return from this digression: lord Dapper∣wit thinking Mellifont would be a useful man in the execution of any villainy, made him an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> liv∣ing with him as a companion, and occasional upper servant, or in other words, as a servile parasite, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whom he might tauntingly exercise all his cruelty, without any dange<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of resentment, which was joy∣fully accepted; and surely, this very circumstance of agreeing to live with any nobleman on such terms must to every delicate mind, sufficiently shew the man in his true colours: for what person who has the least degree of principle or honest pride, would,

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE gentleman, whose history I related in my last chapter, entered the room, just as my lord had determined to give over all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pursuit of Ma∣ria; crying with his usual impudent vivacity;—"Well, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> lord, may I give you joy?—have you found out who this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>air incognita is?—this terrestial angel?"</P>
<P>"Yes, replied his master, with a sullen discontent∣edness,—I have,—her name is Hartry,—she has
<PB N="37" REF="032122_0166_0FF13ACACCF82CD8"/>
twenty thousand pounds at her own disposal, and as it will therefore be impossible to put my schemes into execution, I have resolved to think no more of her."—</P>
<P>Impossible? there's nothing impossible to your lordship's parts, titles and fortune, rejoin'd Mellifont, I thought you had been a man of more intrepidity, than to give up a girl, because she has money; that will indeed prevent your making the intended pro∣posals, but it can be no impediment to the accom∣plishment of your wishes."—</P>
<P>"How, how, demanded my lord, eagerly."</P>
<P>Why, replied he, it will be an easy matter to watch her some night from the rooms,—put her in∣to a wrong chair,—have a carriage waiting.—force her into it,—whirl her down to your house in Wales, where it will be impossible for her friends to find her; and then you know force and fear may induce her to what her inclination perhaps would resist."</P>
<P>"Bravo replied my lord, E'gad that will do; 'twill make a noise in the world, and give a double relish to delight; thou shalt be my oracle and direct all; I must now dress, and hope before morning, to nick Sir John Softhead out of a thousand: call on me to∣morrow forenoon, and we'll settle the glorious plan of amorous operations."</P>
<P>Thus were these two villains planning schemes
<PB N="38" REF="032122_0167_0FF13ACF0F6E0708"/>
for the ruin of an innocent girl, while she was un∣knowingly giving them an opportunity of putting them in execution, by going to the rooms a few even∣ings after the above conference.</P>
<P>On her entrance the first object that struck her eyes was Mellifont: who having already prepared every thing necessary, hasten'd to inform my lord of this lucky circumstance; who thought proper not to make his appearance, till it was time to execute their project.</P>
<P>Unhappily for poor Maria, the night seemed to favour their design, being very rainy, accompanied with a great deal of thunder and lightning.</P>
<P>On her wanting to go home, to her great surprize, her servant was not to be found: and she, of course, prevented from getting to her chair: while she was standing in this situation, my lord, who had taken care to have her servant made drunk at a neighbour∣ing ale-house, appeared, and finding what was the cause of her dilemma, made her an offer of his sedan, which was just by, and which after some little apolo∣gy, she was too easily prevailed on to accept.</P>
<P>While they were standing together, in the course of conversation, he had ask'd her, whether she was afraid of the lightning? of which having expressed great apprehensions, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e put her into the chair, he made that a plea for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> her to draw the cur∣tains
<PB N="39" REF="032122_0168_0FF13AD0D6EF8560"/>
close; which she accordingly did. My lord, elate with joy at his success, now walked as fast as he could before the chairmen, to shew them the way; and whom the reward of a couple of guineas, made proceed at an unusual rate.</P>
<P>They had already got upon the turnpike road, when our heroine, thinking they were very long in carrying her home, opened the curtains, to see where she was;—but, good heavens! what was her aston∣ishment, when she sound herself in an open coun∣try, near a mile from Bath, and lord Dapperwit, whom by the moon being just risen, she could easily distinguish walking before, at a small distance.</P>
<P>When she had so far recovered, from the first vi∣olent effects of her amazement, as to be able to speak, she begg'd the chairmen to stop, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>form her, whither they were carrying her; to which she re∣ceived no other answer, than being desired to sit still:—but, added one of them, "I believe your journey with us is almost at an end: as I think I see the carriage before us."—</P>
<P>She then too plainly saw into my lord's villainy; and with tears in her eyes, entreated the chairmen to return:—in vain did she endeavour to persuade them;—in vain did she promise any reward;—it was all to no purpose:—had it been their inclination, it was impossible; her seducer was just before and had his eyes constantly fixed upon the chair.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="032122_0169_0FF13AD606986A60"/>
As her only resource therefore, she was obliged to call in patience to her assistance and hope the best.</P>
<P>The chair having now stopped, my lord handed her into a post coach; at the same time telling her, that it would be to no purpose to make any resist∣ance; which she was too well convinced of before: and considering that, as it was impossible for her to escape, she should fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the better, if she gave them no occasion to use her roughly, quietly seated her∣self in the carriage next to her betrayer:—Mellifont who had been waiting for them, having previously plac'd himself on the other side, and in this situation, they drove away at an immense pace, a profound silence for some time being observed by all the par∣ties.</P>

<P>DURING the first ten miles of their journey, poor Maria was dissolved in tears, and her swell'd heart beat, as if it would have burst its tender prison, in which state of melancholy insensibility, like an ox going to the slaughter, or a lamb dumb before its shearers, did she remain for some time; till, recol∣lecting that her tears would do but little towards her enlargement, she at last took courage to speak to her seducer.—</P>
<P>In the most pathetic manner, she intreated him
<PB N="42" REF="032122_0171_0FF13AD99B6AFB60"/>
not to make her miserable for life, by thus dividing her from all that she valued upon earth:—she made use of every argument in her power to persuade him to restore her to her friends; but alas! she found they were in vain.—Had she been endowed with the persuasion of a Cicero, or a Demosthenes, they would all have been ineffectual; he was therefore surely not to be worked upon, by what he deemed, the supplications of an unschooled girl: he was pleased to the highest degree, at the success of his scheme; and only answered to all that she said with sullenness, or by a cutting misplaced raillery.</P>
<P>They had travelled in this manner, about three hours, when they stopped to change horses; which, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Maria knew they must do, she had flattered her∣self with the expectation of then finding some means for her escape; but our determin'd Lothario, thanks to the school of vice, in which he had been educated, was not so bad a master of his trade;—he had taken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>care to have proper relays of horses on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and therefore, without being delayed any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> time, they travelled in this expeditio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s manner, till about ten o'clock, when he asked Maria, if she chose any breakfast? which being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> gave fresh orders to his servants to proceed; saying, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he should not stop till the afternoon. And as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> thought himself too for from Bath to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vertaken, he endeavoured to enter into conversation with her,
<PB N="43" REF="032122_0172_0FF13ADD10784F00"/>
by asking a long string of impertinent questions; to all which she answered with the utmost civility and complacence, thinking it best so to do; but her attention was too much engaged, by the melancholy prospect before her, to suffer any one to share in it but Melvill; of him indeed she secretly thought, and for his sake determined to part with her life, sooner than, what was to her, and should be to every wo∣man, dearer than life,—her honour.</P>
<P>About four o'clock they alighted to dinner, at a lone farmhouse, from whence there was no possibility of her escaping, nor any person to compassionate her situation; so that the hopes with which she had hi∣therto buoy'd herself up, were now entirely destroy∣ed: and not to trouble my readers with all the par∣ticulars of a disagreeable journey, I shall content myself with saying, that, after having proceeded at a most furious rate, for a night and a day, she <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound herself in an old ruinated mansion, without any other house in sight; in what part of the world she could not tell: but from the immense mountains behind, she judged it to be, as indeed it really was, on the borders of Wales;—on her arrival at this mansion of vice, as it was then late, she was conducted into a bed chamber, by a person who, from her appearance, she took to be the house keeper.</P>
<P>Having no inclination to sleep, for indeed her
<PB N="44" REF="032122_0173_0FF13AE1CE816CB8"/>
misfortune, touched her too nearly, to suffer her to take any rest, she threw herself upon the bed, with∣out undressing; and, having spent some hours in fruitless endeavours, to gain a short respite from her misery, by slumber, the following lamentations broke from her lips:</P>
<P>"Wretch that I am! where will my calamities end? am I forever doom'd to be the sport of fortune?—alas! why was I not permitted to die while an in∣fant, and by that means to have escaped the many miseries I was born to suffer?—but let me not ar∣raign the All-wise, for through his goodness, I may still be happy; although the path, to my weak sight, appears inextricable."—</P>
<P>"Oh Melvill! were you but acquainted with my sufferings, and knew how much I stand in need of your assistance—I'm sure you would joyfully bestow it; but why do I still think of him? or, to what pur∣pose do I own my love? he quits his native land to fly from me:—but my poor mother!—what tor∣tures now must she endure? alas! how must her dear heart bleed for her afflicted daughter?"—In this manner did she spend the greatest part of the night, while he that was the cause of her misfortunes, slept as serenely, as if blest with native innocence; but, as misery cannot endure for ever, the tender nature of Maria, being almost wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n out, at length gave way to peaceful slumber, that balm of hurt minds, chief
<PB N="45" REF="032122_0174_0FF13AE3941D94F8"/>
nourisher of life's great feast; and she had, for some time, lost her senses in a delusive dream, when the entrance of a servant, who came to bring her fresh <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>loaths, awakened her, to recollect the poignant situ∣ation she was in.</P>
<P>As soon as she was dressed, she was conducted to my lord who after breakfast, began to take some unjustifiable liberties with her; upon which she a▪ again implored him on her knees, not to detain her longer against her will: and attempted to represent to him, the sinfulness of his inhospitable treatment; but as, to use his own expression, he was not then in a humour for moralizing: he left her, saying, that he would give her two days for consideration thereon▪ but that if, at the end of that time, she still obsti∣nately refused to gratify his wishes—force should prevail.</P>
<P>This was a terrible declaration for the afflicted Ma∣ria; who fixing her lovely eyes stedfastly on the ground, seem'd for some time stupified by thought; at length rising triumphantly, she exclaimed "Yes—it shall be so—I am determined—firmly fixed—that if before the end of two days, no apparent means for my escape are found—I will at once put an end to all my heart-rending miseries—by—by what? oh distracting thought! by suicide."—Then a∣gain dropping on her knees, and clasping her hands, she cried, "I know the heinousness of the crime, I

have resolved to commit—I see it in its full force—terrible to think of, and shocking to human nature—but still I hope for mercy—I hope that the absolute necessity for the action—my prefering death, and that by my own hand too, to the loss of my honor, will, in some measure, palliate and atone for the attroci∣ousness of the deed; and that the all-wise Being will in another world, pardon the wickedness of a crime, which misery and despair have drove me to in this—a crime, which even under these circumstances, makes my nature shudder, and almost abhor her own resolves."</P>

<P>WHEN our heroine had made the dreadful resolution, with which I concluded my last chapter she seemed much more calm and easy than before: and in order to amuse herself, took up her favourite author, Shakespear, which lay on a table by her; when on opening it, the first words on which she cast her eyes were,
<Q><PB N="47" REF="032122_0176_0FF13AEC6DE11E00"/>
<L>—Against self-slaughter</L>
<L>There is a prohibition, so divine,</L>
<L>That cravens my weak hand.</L>
<BIBL>CYMBELINE.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>On reading this sentence, it was with the greatest difficulty, that she could support herself, after the impious determination she had just made, she could not look upon it as entirely accidental, but on the contrary, rather considered it as a rebuke from above for the sinfulness o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> her intentions, and as a warning against executing them; in vain did she attempt to argue with herself, that it was merely fortuitous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> she pitched upon that particular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> could not be persuaded of it, and if that was the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, she determined to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thereby:—in short, the firmness and intrepidity she had just boasted—were vanished—the light in which she had before consid∣ered the deed, to make it justifiable, was chang'd—thrice happy would it be, were every one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to reap advantage from an accident, I do not mean in the like case, as it is to be hoped, that no one, how∣ever unhappy, will ever be thus induc'd to forget the supreme duty which he owes to his Creator and himself; neither would I be understood to signify, that every one is blessed with so timely and forceable a warning; all that I would wish to inculcate by these reflections, is, to advise the children of adversity, when they have made a resolution, however trifling
<PB N="48" REF="032122_0177_0FF13AF2EFBF2500"/>
or momentous, previous to the execution thereof; seriously to ask their own consciences, whether, what they are about to do is justifiable, either in the sight of God or man? and I am thoroughly convinc'd, they will need no other monitor to advise them what course to take.</P>
<P>But to return to poor Maria, the above affair made so deep an impression on her mind, that she could no more recover her tranquility, but almost distract∣ed by the equal counterpoise of doubt and fear, passed the day in the most painful uncertainty which way to act; and after a restless night, rose in the morning regarding herself as a victim, destin'd for a sacrifice, to the base purposes of infamous nobility: and altho she had now laid aside all thoughts of revenging her∣self upon herself, still she resolved to part with life, in preference to her honour, well knowing, that the former is a debt which all must pay, and that nothing ever can justify a deprivation of the latter; however before she attempted to repel force by force, she de∣determined again to use all her rhetorick, to persuade him to relinquish his designs: and as she knew he had no love for her, exclusive of gross gratifications, which disgrace the character of a man: she flattered herself, that when he should see the crime in its true light, that some spark of that goodness, nature has planted in every breast▪ would check the violence of his passions; but we are all too apt to judge of others by ourselves, this was her own way of thinking, and
<PB N="49" REF="032122_0178_0FF13AF6349E13D8"/>
therefore she vainly thought, it must be his like∣wise.—</P>
<P>Happy indeed, would it have been for her, had her opinion been founded on just grounds, as he would then never have violated the laws of humanity, by thus basely violating her inclinations and peace of mind; however luckily she had no occasion to make use of her elocution, had it depended on that only, it would indeed have gone hard with her;—but while she was sitting at breakfast, Mellifont, whom she had not before seen since her arrival, en∣tered the room, and having enquired after her health, &amp;c. told her the occasion of his visit, as follows:</P>
<P>"I have, said he, madam, much against my incli∣nations, been concerned in bringing you here, but it was not in my power to avoid it: I am a depen∣dant on Lord Dapperwit, and must obey his com∣mands;—he knew it, he knew that I da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed not act contrary to his will, and therefore ungenerously used his power, by making me a party i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this affair; from the beginning of which, I sincerely pitied you, tho' I dared not openly express it, but am now come to convince you thereof: my lord is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> out, and will not return till the evening, if you please, I'll con∣duct you to your friends—but, as by so doing, I must inevitably lose my subsistence; I shall expect a handsome gratuity for running this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>."</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="032122_0179_0FF13AF7EAFC1EB0"/>
As our heroine was not in a condition to hesitate she readily promised him a thousand pounds, as soon as he should deliver her to Mr. Howard, and thank'd her preserver in the most expressive terms, for his goodness;—after which, they set out toge∣ther on foot, and having walked about two miles, ar∣rived at an inn, from whence they took a post chaise, and proceeded with all speed towards Bath.</P>

<P>WHEN Maria had got so far from the house of her betrayer, as no longer to be under any apprehen∣sions of a pursuit, she again took an opportunity of thanking her deliverer, in the most grateful terms: tho he was by no means deserving thereof, as it was not honor, but avarice, which actuated him in this affair; and, to say the truth, he was in it playing the double villain, having just before, received a large sum from lord Dapperwit, for his assistance in bring∣ing
<PB N="51" REF="032122_0180_0FF13AF9D1AA56C0"/>
away Maria: and was now injuring that noble∣man, by aiding and being privy to her escape: in∣deed he made no scruple of the latter, as it was per∣forming a good action; had it not, it would have been the same; for friendship, gratitude, and every other virtue, would have given way to that demon, self-interest.</P>
<P>When within about fifty miles of Bath, Maria had the happiness of meeting Mr. Howard, who was then going in search of her. Great was the joy on both sides, at this unexpected re-encounter: after the expression of which, our heroine took an opportu∣nity of informing Mr. Howard of all that had hap∣pened to her, since their separation; as likewise of her promise to Mellifont; to whom, after having made proper acknowledgments for his behaviour, he g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve a draught on his banker, payable at sight, for the agreed on sum, with a cordial invitation into—shire; and having dined together, they then parted, Mellifont for London, to receive his thousand pounds, and Mr. Howard, with his charge for Bath: on their road to which place, he gave the following answer to her questions, concerning the reason why they had so long delayed sending in quest of her.</P>
<P>"Indeed my dear, said he, you totally mistake the affair, as I can assure you, that we proceeded with all
<PB N="52" REF="032122_0181_0FF13AFED81D6A88"/>
possible expedition, in our endeavours to recover you; when, after waiting a tedious length of time, we found you did not return from the rooms;—you may easily imagine the consternation we were in, and with what painful anxiety we spent the rest of the night;—in the morning I made strict enquiry after you all over the town, but to no purpose; nor could we tell what to think of so extraordinary an af∣fair; we had no suspicion of lord Dapperwit, nor indeed of any one else; and should have been to∣tally at a loss what course to have taken, had it not been for an anonymous letter, I that day received, in∣forming me, you were carried to London. This as I have since discovered, was sent by the lord's own orders, to put us into a wrong track; however in consequence thereof, I immediately set out for town, making inquiries after you at every inn on the road, tho', as you may imagine, to no purpose. I now began to suspect the trick that had been play'd me; when remembering that Lord Dappperwit was miss∣ed from Bath, at the same time with yourself, with∣out any one being acquainted with his design; and likewise recollecting that he had a house in Caermar∣thenshire, I thought is most likely that were he your seducer, he had carried you thither, and therefore resolved upon paying him a visit; on my road to which place I was, when my joyful meeting with you, happily prevented me from pursuing my jour∣ney: and I hope we shall soon distribute happiness to a miserable family by our arrival at Bath."</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="032122_0182_0FF13B02334DED28"/>
Maria then made tender inquiries after her mother and Charlottee, whom he informed her were well when he left them; but that he was under great ap∣prehensions, lest the grief which lady Hartry must inevitably feel, for not hearing of her daughter, would be too much for her constitution, which was already not a little impaired, by the repeated shocks she had lately undergone: nor were his sus∣picions groundless; as on their arrival they found her ill in bed, and Charlotte in a situation almost similar.</P>
<P>To describe the meeting between these friends, requires the efforts of an abler pen than mine; I shall therefore by dropping a curtain over so pa∣thetic a scene, leave every one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o figure to themselves what I cannot find terms to give them an adequate idea of, and content myself with observing, that there was never a stronger proof of the verity of the old remark, "That we find more joy in the compa∣ny of one that is reg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in'd, than twenty, who have never been lost;" than in this instance.</P>
<P>As lady Hartry's peace of mind was now restor'd, she daily grew better, and in a short time, had no other remains of her disorder left, than an unusual langour of spirits; when judging it most expedient, to leave Bath as soon as possible, they determined to spend the ensuing winter in London, at which place they arrived without any m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>teri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l accident▪ and were

<P>Having thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rought them to so sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e a place, I shall now quit them, and once more beg my readers company, to visit an old acquaintance at Madrid; though before I take my entire leave of London I cannot forbear communicating to him a piece of news, at which, I don't doubt, he will be full as much surprised, as were the newly arrived family; who, at their first interview with Sir Henry Sum∣mers, had the mortification of hearing from him, that Mr. Martin, who, for the first three months after poor AEmily's death, seem'd inconsolable for her loss, and to have vow'd a state of perpetual celibacy, was on the point of marriage with a young lady of immense fortune.—</P>
<P>Since such is the unaccountable caprice of the in∣constancy of human nature; who will place any confidence in the resolves of man? which too often like characters graven upon sand, are liable to be effac'd by every adventitious blast.</P>

<P>WHILE Maria was involved in those dis∣tressful circumstances, Melvill remain'd if not hap∣py, at least tranquil, with his friends at Madrid, whose company he found <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o agreeable, that he seem'd to have renounc'd all inclinations for returning to England; and although he was conscious, that his presence there, would in a few months be necessary on account of his coming of age; still it is very un∣certain, when he would have prevail'd upon himself to make the voyage, had it not have been for the death of po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Juliana; who, however her outward behaviour, might indicate a total annihilation of her unhappy passion, still inwardly retain'd the same ar∣dent affection for our hero as ever, which notwith∣standing there separation, instead of abating, seem'd every day to increase; but having once refus'd her hand, she had too much commendable pride, to en∣deavour to gain by solicitation, the affections of a man, who could not love her from inclination, and
<PB N="56" REF="032122_0185_0FF13B0C1E5F0E10"/>
though she was conscious of the impropriety of her conduct, had not resolution to abandon him from her mind, but inwardly lamenting her unhappy fate, she pin'd in thought; and in the blooming vigour of her life, became a martyr to a misplac'd passion.—</P>
<P>Death alone, could give a respite to those tortures from which, during her woe-fraught life, she knew no ease.—</P>
<P>To you, ye virgins, who by nature are endowed with an uncommon share of tenderness and sensibili∣ty, this story is addressed; whose minds, like the fair surface of an unsullied snow, are susceptible of every impression, which the rude <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oot-steps of the passing traveller, may chance to make:—In every age,—in every clime,—al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sages have agreed, that examples strike, when precepts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail;—in lovely Ju∣liana's lot, behold, the sad effects of disappointed love: from her example, learn never to fix your heart upon a stranger, until you know whether he is deserving of, or has it in his power to receive the gift:—suffer not your eyes to gaze on his admir'd perfections, lest when you express your approbation you should imbibe the poison of a hopeless, and there∣by finish your existence;—leave not your parents, sister,—brother,—friend, to mourn for their depart∣ed child, or friend:—let this poor maiden's couse, serve-as a boy for you; to shun the rock which she has split on; so shall the living by the dead be

taught,—but a truce with grave reflections;—she is gone:—peace attend her spirit,—for impotently vain is ev'ry lamentation for her loss: or in short, any loss of a temporal nature.</P>
<P>The whole family imagined Juliana's disorder to be a consumption, but with, her latest breath, and ne∣ver till then, did she confess the miserable cause of her indisposition:—a broken heart.</P>
<P>Nobody that was acquainted with her perfections, when living, could help pitying her fate, when dead; as did Melvill, perhaps more sincerely than any other; but finding that although involuntarily, he nevertheless was considered as the sole author of her death: and that instead of a hearty welcome from Don Pelajo, he met with nothing but a cold re∣ception, with far-fetch'd compliments; he determi∣ned once more to visit his native soil, though he dreaded to see a place, where he had once experien∣ced such uninterrupted felicity, and much more to see her, who was the cause of all his uneasiness; but for the above reason, finding it absolutely ne∣cessary, he made no long hesitation on the subject, and taking a tender farewell of Don Carlos, who still retain'd his former friendship for him, in a few days set out for Paris, which place, he had promised some acquaintances there, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> make in his return home; and thinking a surprize would be far the most agree∣able: he deferr'd writing to Mr. Howard, till he

<P>ON our hero's arrival at Paris, he was easily prevail'd upon by some English gentlemen, who were there on a party of pleasure, to make that the place of his residence for a month, about half of which time had elapsed; when having occasion for some stock∣ings he went to a hosiers in the rue de St. Germain; on his entrance of the shop, he observ'd behind the counter, a young man in half mourning, of whose face, he had some confus'd remembrance, but no par∣ticular idea: his address was easy and genteel, with∣out pertness, and in his whole behaviour, there was a politeness superior to what we generally meet with, in people in that rank of life;—at which Melvill was not a little surprized, especially as by his conversation he found, that he was not a native of France, and that therefore his gentility was far different from that officious politesse, so naturally
<PB N="59" REF="032122_0188_0FF12AEE6DEF6A28"/>
the inherent qualification of every frenchman: and it still running in his head strongly, that he had seen him somewhere before; he could not forbear asking him the question.</P>
<P>"Very likely, reply'd the young man, as I per∣ceive we are countrymen."—</P>
<P>Melvill finding from this laconic answer, that he did not seem desirable of entering into particulars: from his unwillingness to give any man unnecessary pain, dropped the subject: some general conversa∣tion concerning England, then passed, and Melvill having bought what he wanted, was leaving the shop; when, by some accident, a ring dropped from the hosier's finger, which being the nimbler of the two, our hero picked up, and was returning to its owner; when casting his eyes on it, he saw under the chrystal, on a piece of white sattin, curiously work'd with hair: the letters,

<P>Having examined this ring very attentirely for some time, he exclaimed—"No, it is impossible; it can never be;" and returing it to the hosier, with
<PB N="60" REF="032122_0189_0FF12AF061B37100"/>
a low bow said—"Will you not Sir deem me very impertinent, if I desire you to favour me with an ac∣count how you came by this ring?" By no means, replied his countryman; it was given me some years ago by a young lady, to whom I then had, and still have, a most inviolable attatchment; she worked it a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as you see, with her own hair: and when she put it on made me swear never to part with it; which vow, I mean faithfully and solemnly to observe: the device I need not explain to you—the letters are e∣qually the initials of either of our names, which I once flattered myself, would some time or other be the same; but adverse fate ordain'd it otherwise: nor do I, at this instant know whether she is living or dead." While he was thus speaking. Melvill's countenance underwent several changes; and ob∣serving that he had finished, with great energy ex∣claiming, "Yes, Sir, she lives; and you may both be happpy."</P>
<P>He inst<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly stew into his arms, crying, "Good God! that ever I should recognize my long lost friend, Charles Hartry, in the person of a hosier at Paris!" Charles, for it was really him, beginning now to recollect his friend and play fellow, returned the embrace with equal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and they mutually con∣gratulated each other on so unexpected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>. When their first <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> sub∣sided, Sir Charles, for such the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> must know he was, though neither Melvill, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>, did, made
<PB N="61" REF="032122_0190_0FF12B5FB4740250"/>
tender enquiries after his own, and Mr. Howard's family; of both which Melvill gave him all the ac∣count he could: nor did he forget to inform him of the happy change in Sir Thomas's affections.—He likewise related to him every circumstance of his sister's behaviour towards him; as also his adven∣tures since that fatal day; and concluded, by in∣forming him of his intended journey to England, to which place, he now hoped, he would accompany him.</P>
<P>Sir Charles having no longer the same reasons for absenting himself as heretofore, readily coincid∣ed with his proposal: but some time being necessa∣ry, for him to get rid of his business, our hero was detained longer at Paris, than he at first intended; which however, being on so agreeable an occasion, gave him very little concern:—During their journey he gave Melvill the following account of his ad∣ventures, since his departure from Oak-hall, which he had purposely refered as an amusement for that time.</P>

<P>IT is surely unnecessary for me to inform my dear Melvill, of the reasons for my departure from Oakhall; he must, during my stay there, too often have seen the unhappy cause.</P>
<P>In my younger days, he must have observed, that unjust taunts, and menaces, were the only returns I received for duty and humility; but being once arrived at a discretionary age, when divested of every juvenile prejudice, I could see things in their true light; and, finding it was not in my power to please my father, by the most careful assiduity, I thought his behaviour justified me, in resolving at once to rid him of an object, which was so disagreeable, thrice happy, that I am no longer so, and myself of a life that I was most heartily tired of, by endeavour∣ing to find that tranquility among strangers, which the unaccountable caprice of a parent deprived me of at home. As it was, in all probability, the last time I should ever trouble him, I made no scruple
<PB N="63" REF="032122_0192_0FF12B6759584030"/>
of taking away fifty pounds, which he had given me to pay to some tradesmen; and packing up a few cloaths in my portmanteau, I set out early one mor∣ning, on my own horse, as you must have heard, without communicating to any one what were my intentions; nor did I stop to take one farewell of my most amiable Charlottee; though I now declare to you, that could I have had the least idea of what I afterwards suffered, only from the consideration of the excruciating tortures, which my behaviour must necessarily give her, she never should have had so melancholy a cause for her affliction.</P>
<P>As London was a place which I had a most earnest desire to see, I determined to go thither immediate∣ly, and by getting employment as a clerk, in some merchant's counting-house, for which, by my edu∣cation, I was very well qualified, at once make my∣self independent of him, whom, by all the laws of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ture, and paternal tenderness, I had a right to ex∣pect assistance from.</P>
<P>Accordingly arriving at the place of my destina∣tion, without any adventure worth troubling you with, I the next day, disposed of my horse for twen∣ty-five pounds; and thus finding myself master of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear fourscore guineas, determined to remain some∣time out of employment, that I might have an oppor∣tunity of satisfying my curiosity, by seeing every thing
<PB N="64" REF="032122_0193_0FF12B6A4C4CCDC0"/>
worth notice in London; and having expended near a fourth part of my capital, in some unnecessa∣ry superfluities, commenced the man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> taste; I fre∣quented a genteel coffee-house, was constant at the theatres, and all other public places of diversion; which of course drew me into a numerous acquaint∣ance; most of whom, by my appearance, mistak∣ing me for some newly fledged heir of quality, paid me their constant court, in hopes of having their share of my spoils. And London had opened to me such a scene of false pleasure, that I had not been there many days, before I found my money reduced to something under thirty pounds: I now consider∣ed at the extravagant rate I went on, the remainder could not last long; and therefore began seriously to think of getting into some employment: in order for which, I constantly read all the advertisements, in hopes of there meeting with something to my pur∣pose, but to my great sorrow, had every day the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of a disappointment.</P>
<P>I had now been in London a fortnight, and found myself no nearer gaining of my point than on the first night of my arrival; however, having still twen∣ty pounds le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, I thought, with frugality, it was a provision for some months: and indeed, happy it was, that I proceeded with such prudence, as I should otherwise have lost the sweetest sensations that I ev∣er enjoyed, having in a short time after this an op∣portunity
<PB N="65" REF="032122_0194_0FF13B142EEB2390"/>
of employing almost my whole possessions in an act of charity: you stare at hearing a man talk thus, in an age when many, whose riches are immense, would refuse a shilling to assist a starving fellow-creature: but suppress your astonishment, till you have heard the particulars. Having one evening been prevailed upon to sup at the tavern, where I had foolishly thrown away a couple of gui∣neas, at the billiard table; I was walking home, condemning myself for my folly, when my attention was awakened in a very extraordinary manner.</P>
<P>It was between twelve and one o'clock in the morning; when, passing by a genteel house, I heard the most violent screams, which gave me reason to suspect that some injury was committing, on a per∣son, who, by the voice I knew to be a woman; and presently after I saw the door opened, and something white thrown with the greatest violence into the middle of the street: but, gracious heaven! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was my astonishment, when on my nearer approach I found it to be a woman almost naked. By the as∣sistance of the watch I helped her up, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d having, with the greatest difficulty brought her to herself, she begg'd me, in the most supplicating manner, "to take pity on a wretch, whose only abode, without my generous assistance, must be in the street, at once exposed to the inclemency of the weather, and all

the domine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing insolence of office." I found by her manner of expression, that she once had known far happier days. What her person was, it was im∣possible to discern:—her hair was dishevelled, and hung loose upon her neck, which, with her eyes, and face, was beat in a most terrible manner: however there was something altogether, which loudly call∣ed for my compassion, and not being proof against her tears, I called a coach, and putting her into it, drove to my lodgings.</P>
<P>During our little journey, her tears seemed totally to impede all her powers of speech; nor were they at all abated, by the difficulty, which on our arrival, I found in getting her admitted: my landlady objected strongly against it, for the honor of her house; and indeed, every circumstance considered, there was nothing very unreasonable in her objections; un∣doubtedly taking an unknown female, at that time, to a single man's lodgings, carried far from a good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with it: however, as I stood pretty high in her good graces, by dint of persuasion I at last gained my point; and having resigned my bed to the stranger for that night, went to lie wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> another lodger in the house: but my mind was too full of this adventure, to suffer me to get any rest. Rising very early, I ran <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> give a succinct account thereof to my landlady;—who being a good kind of good woman, I do not mean according to the general implication of that

term, I fancy, sincerely believ'd all I said, and, at my instigation, help'd this miserable unfortunate to some cloaths: to whom, as soon as she was dressed, I sent my compliments, desiring her company to break∣fast; and having returned a suitable answer to my message, she in a few minutes, entered the room, where I was waiting for her.</P>
<P>She was a tall, genteel, well made woman, and notwithstanding her eyes, and the other parts of her face, bore apparent marks of the bruises she had received—I could still distinguish that she was handsome; her teeth were remarkably fine, and as her dress now in some measure, corresponded with the dignity of her figure; she had an undoubt∣ed right to the title of a fine woman.</P>
<P>On her entrance, I saw that she wanted to say something to me, but could not—I saw the gratitude of heart hanging upon her lips, and pressing her ut∣terance; conscious that she felt more than she <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> power to express, I arose, and endeavoured to re∣lieve her, by enquiring after her health; I then led her to a chair, where she was no sooner seated, than the sense of the obligation she had to me, overcame her, and bursting into tears, she cried, "Oh Sir! what shall I say to you?—how?—in what manner shall I thank you? but words are insufficient, far, far too faint, to express the feelings of my soul, at
<PB N="68" REF="032122_0197_0FF13B1B435A5E30"/>
this interesting minute; and although I am convin∣ced, that a man who could have the heart to do such an act, must judge what my sensations are; still I shall never he able to return you sufficient thanks, for your goodness, to a poor wretch, who without your assistance, by this time, would have been no more."</P>
<P>"Oh Sir, you may enjoy the moral, social satisfaction of having snatch'd from perdition a person in the complicated distresses of nakedness, and want and what is still much worse, loaded with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>-re∣proaching conscience."</P>
<P>I never in my whole life, had more occasion for words, than at this instant, and never made a worse use of them. I wished to say something to sooth her feelings; but for a long time, was at a loss; the dig∣nity of her appearance, joined to the penetrating soft∣ness of her tears, quite overcame, me; and it was not till after a long silence, that I recollected myself so far, as to beg she would not distress me, by saying any more on a subject equally painful to us both—to assure her, that I had done nothing, but what I hop'd every man would have done in the same situation: from which, as it was but my duty, I could claim no merit, and that if I really had any—I was suffici∣ently overpaid by consciousness of having acted right:—that as I was a man, I could not see the dis∣tresses
<PB N="69" REF="032122_0198_0FF13B1E6E3A2310"/>
of my fellow creatures, and divest myself of tender feelings—nor indeed would I have parted with them at that moment, for the wealth of the In∣dies.</P>
<P>She now seemed something compos'd, and I had the satisfaction of seeing her eat some breakfast; after which, she again thank'd me in the politest manner, and in terms, which at once shewed her gratitude &amp; good sensethough at the same time she loaded herself with reproaches, as the cause of all her misfortunes, and seem'd but little short of a state of absolute des∣peration.—</P>
<P>I endeavoured to solace her afflictions, by begging that she would look upon me, as a person, inclin'd to do every thing in his power to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erve her; and then represented to her the sinfulness of not placing a just hope in providential protection; she thank'd me for my friendly intentions, and added, that were I ac∣quainted with her history, I should not only blame and despise, as much as I was now inclined to serve her."</P>
<P>My reply was natural, and came of course—"I could not think so, and that of a recital of her story, would not give her to much pain, by the recollec∣tion of past misfortunes, she could not oblige me more, than by favouring me with it:"—she reply'd; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat my behaviour gave me an undoubted right to
<PB N="70" REF="032122_0199_0FF13B22AE1DF438"/>
know it, and notwithstanding it would unavoidably recall to her mind, things she could wish ever to for∣get:—and though she must run the hazard of forfeit∣ing my good opinion, by laying open to my view, the catalogue of follies, or rather vices, she had been guilty of; nevertheless, she could refuse nothing to a person to whom she had so powerful an obligation, and accordingly instantly related it;" to which as it may serve for a good lesson to all young people of the female sex; and will not be totally useless to ours: I shall make no scruple of begging your at∣tention, I give it in her own words, which were, as you will find, in the following chapter.</P>

<BIBL>KING LEAR,</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN order to inspire you with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of my own misfortunes, I must first give you some account of my family, as from one unworthy part thereof, all
<PB N="71" REF="032122_0200_0FF13B261E4D5AD0"/>
my unhappiness has proceeded: my father whose name was Barton, was a gentleman of a goost estate in Gloucestershire: when I say good, I would be un∣derstood to mean, that it was amply sufficient to pur∣chase every real necessary of life, though not large enough to furnish the ridiculous and prejudicial su∣perfluities, which his openness of heart wished to command, and which he was imprudently determi∣ned, at any rate to procure; you will excuse me Sir, for thus touching upon the frailties of a parent; but as you have an undoubted right to my most candid ingenuity, I must acknowledge, that extravagance was his foible, and has been my ruin.</P>
<P>He married my mother, with whom he had a for∣tune of five thousand pounds, while he was very young, &amp; from the uniform propriety of her conduct had never any occasion to repent of his choice; about a year after which, she was brought to bed of a daughter, who, being the first tender pledge of mu∣tual love, call'd for all the attention of her parents, which they, in their fondness readily bestow'd: nor while a child, was her innocent prattle ever tiresome, rather ever new; and in the extatic moments of parental joy, they too vainly thought their happiness complete; but alas! how was that felicity damp'd, to have the mortification of observing, when their daughter was arrived at tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> period of life, where the disposition being no longer hid by the inadvertent
<PB N="72" REF="032122_0201_0FF13B2D66F1FC68"/>
sallies of a sprightly youthfulness, begins to shew it∣self in its true colours; that she was ill-tempered to excess, peevish, discontented, and to crown all, pos∣sessed of a height of malevolent pride, that must ne∣cessarily render her odious to every beholder: in short, she was totally destitute of that affability and complaisance, which alone can make every young lady agreeable.</P>
<P>No wonder, that her parents did not feel the same cordiality of affection for her, that they would have done, for one of whom they had less reason to com∣plain; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all the powers of nature stiring within, still informed them that she was their child.—No circumstance in their behaviour, ever indicated the least want of a true parental regard!—her wishes were her will:—nor would it have been possible for her to observe the alteration in their hearts, had they not found another object on whom to bestow their tenderness—I mean myself; who was born when my sister was about fifteen years old.</P>
<P>It is easier for you to imagine, than me to describe, the joy, as I have since been informed, which my fa∣ther felt upon this occasion—I quickly became a favourite with the whole family, except my sister, by whom I was secretly as much detested, as I was admired by my parents; which in their absence she always took care to express, by the most cruel treat∣ment;
<PB N="73" REF="032122_0202_0FF13B2F1A27DCA0"/>
not that it arose from consciousness of having lost a place in their hearts, but her pride could ill-brook so powerful a rival therein as myself; and out of a false spirit of resentment, at the age of two-and-twenty, she went off with a neighbouring baron∣et, for she had external charms to attract a man of gallantry; with whom, after a long search, her pa∣rents heard she lived in a most scandalous manner, in open defiance of every law of modesty or honour.</P>
<P>Her afflicted father, imagining that an aliena∣tion of his affections was the cause of this imprudent step, wrote to her, in the most soothing and affection∣ate terms, earnestly intreating her to return, and pro∣mising to receive her with open arms;—freely to forget and forgive all her past behaviour:—when, would you think? that equally insensible to the justness of his remonstrances, and the tender kind∣ness of his solicitations, she had the cruelty to return for answer, "that she would never conform to all the capricious whims of a younger brat, while she had the means of existence in her own hands; and could live without the assistance of those, whom the world called her friends."</P>
<P>Oh, Sir, think what my poor father must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eel at this instant! to see his own daughter in the down∣hill towards perdition; lost to every sense of duty to her parents, or her God.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="032122_0203_0FF13B30D5B488A8"/>
I▪ was too young to experience any degree of afflic∣tion; but being completely blessed in the entire af∣fections of my parents, whose love for their darling seemed every day to increase.</P>
<P>My juvenile years passed in the most pleasing and harmonious manner.—Thus happy, inattentive, did I live; nor ever knew what it was to feel the pangs of agonizing sorrow, till my dear mother's death, which happened when I was about sixteen years old.</P>
<P>With her I might justly say departed all my joy: thrice happy had I been, if heaven in commisera∣tion of my youth and inexperience, had kindly suf∣fered one grave to have contained us both; but fate reserved me for superior woe: sure I was born be∣neath the influence of an unlucky planet, which on the thread of my existence, stamped the party-co∣loured doom of misery.</P>
<P>The poignancy of that affliction, which from the tender sensibility of my father's nature, he must of course be supposed to have felt, for the loss of so good, so loved a wife, gave rise to a disorder, in which after having linger'd for near a twelve month, his phy∣sicians assured him to be the last stage of a confirmed consumption: and the fatigue which I underwent in attending him, through every gradation of this flattering malady, joined to my grief for the ap∣proaching death of the tenderest, best of parents, soon rendered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> much more sit to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ull in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> repose,
<PB N="75" REF="032122_0204_0FF13B32F352BBA0"/>
than to experience the heart-felt toil of nightly watching by a sick father's bed.</P>
<P>In short, Sir, not to trouble you with any unneces∣sary particulars, his distemper seemed every mo∣ment to increase: and finding the fatal moment of his dissolution nigh, he called me to him, when gent∣ly pressing my hand, his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeble eyes, half drown'd in briny tears, he pronounced words, which made so deep an impression on my young mind, as never to be erased, but by the all-subduing hand of time.</P>
<P>"Oh, my dear child, cried he, how shall I dare to look up to you for forgiveness? In what words shall I intreat you to pardon me, for the most attro∣cious crime that parent e'er was guilty of.</P>
<P>"Oh my Betsy, I have cruelly deceived you;—nay, I have deceived myself and all the world; my unbounded love for you, has made me inattentive to my own concerns; I have lived too fast, and have now the agonizing reflection, that I must quickly leave you, liable to every insult, which unguarded virtue meets with, without having it in my power to provide for your subsistence; at a time too, when, from your age, you have most need of some experi∣enced band, to guide your unwary youth, through this wide, precarious, and turbulent world:—my whole estate is mortgaged for more than its real worth; a false mistaken pride, with an unguarded,
<PB N="76" REF="032122_0205_0FF13B39D572C4B8"/>
therefore ill-applied, generosity, have been my ruin: my only care has been, to appear insignificantly grand in the eyes of that world, who must hereafter inev∣itably despise me, at a time, when all my attention should have been fixed upon your future establish∣ment and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elicity. When my poor eyes are closed in endless night, what will you alone—helpless and innocent do? no friendly counsellor to advise; no hand to lead your young feet, through the broad path of vice, which opens such a scene of tempting, dangerous pleasure to inexperienced youth, that they perforce must yield to it, and for a single moment of sense-deluding gratification, undergo a life, perhaps an eternity of future woe. But my child, arm your∣self with resolution, and when I am no longer pre∣sent to assist you, remember the last precepts of a dy∣ing parent—Confide in the all-wise Being; do not distrust him, and he will never forsake you: nor let the flow'ry, eye-catching paths of sensual enjoyment, tempt you to depart from the thorny, difficult one of virtue."</P>
<P>"While you are virtuous, my child, you may be happy in yourself, and despise the vanities of a mis∣taken world: do thus while young, and when the stealing steps of age draw on, you will be delivered from the tortures of a self-condemnation, and the in∣fluence of shame, remorse, or terror: embrace reli∣gion with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ervent cordiality, and be happy: <HI>for all

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er ways are pleasantness▪ and all her paths are peace."</HI>—Then clasping his hands, with uplifted eyes, he added, "still may the omnipresent Providence, look down with pity on your youth, and by his pow∣er conduct you guiltless, through that intricate maze of wickedness in which you are placed; so when sup∣ported by the sweet influence of a balmy hope, you will never lose the innocence of heart of which you are now possessed; nor, when bowing under compli∣cated distresses, sink under the gloom despair."</P>
<P>Here his voice failed him: and in a few moments he sunk into eternity, leaving me an orphan, desti∣tute of every necessary of life.</P>
<P>Forgive Sir, said she, bursting into tears, forgive this tribute, which nature requires me to pay to the memory of a poor, fond, though indiscreet father;—on whom I can never think, but with a reverential awe. Having indulged her commendable filial grief for a few moments, she proceeded as follows:</P>

<P>I FOUND all that he had said, with regard to his affairs, but too strictly true; for as soon as his death was known, his creditors instantly seized up∣on his effects, which they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old to pay themselves as far as they would go.</P>
<P>Thus situated, you can but imperfectly imagine the distress I was in.—The house and estate were the property of a gentleman to whom they were mortga∣ged; and who politely gave me leave to remain there, till I had an opportunity of providing for my∣self elsewhere.</P>
<P>Not to dwell too long on so melancholy a s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b∣ject, my father had been dead about a week, when I was surprised by a visit from a lady, of whom I had no knowledge▪—I had indeed, some confus'd idea of
<PB N="79" REF="032122_0208_0FF13B439D3BE6E8"/>
her face; but no particular remembrance of it: however, not suffering me to remain long in this un∣certainty, she made herself known to me, in the per∣son of my eldest sister; and addressing me in the most affectionate manner—with marks of a real penitence, confessed the crimes she had been guilty of; and added, "that time having brought her to a just sen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e thereof, she had persuaded Sir Henry Rakish, the baronnet with whom she went off, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o marry her;—but that heaven did not permit them long to enjoy their happy union, her husband having died about two years before, leaving her mistress of a handsome fortune."—She added, "that after her behaviour▪ she thought it to no purpose, to attempt a reconcilia∣tion, during her father's life-time; but hearing of his death, and the circumstances of his affairs, she could not bear, that so near and deserving a relation should want, while it was in her power to assist her;" and concluded, by insisting on my going to live with her—As I had before heard of the death of the above mentioned baronnet, I made no scruple of believing all she said to be true; which were welcome tidings to a person in my distressed situation: we therefore, the next morning, set out for London, at which place we arrived without any material accident.</P>
<P>I had now no reason to complain of my lot, as my sister behaved to me with the greatest tenderness and affection.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="032122_0209_0FF13B4718558DA0"/>
For three weeks I thought myself, and really was completely happy. She went but very little abroad, tho' there was no day passed, in which she was not visited by a number of gentlemen, most of whom took particular notice of me: but as I thought it no more than they would have done of any other person, not totally destitute of beauty, I looked upon all the compliments which were made me, as things of course, and therefore paid no further attention to them.</P>
<P>There was one gentleman in particular, whose name was Hartrop, who always behav'd to me with an uncommon degree of politeness and warm civili∣ty; and he was really an agreeable man, I will con∣fess that I was very much pleas'd with his conversa∣tion.</P>
<P>I was frequently alone with him, when he never behav'd in any manner, that was not consistent with the strictest reserve and delicacy; nor had I the least suspicion of the villainy of his intentions, till one particular day, when having dined with us, my sister left us alone, saying, that she had some business which would not long detain her, and beg'd me to entertain Mr. Hartrop till her return.</P>
<P>We had not been together many minutes, before he began to take some unjustifiable liberties with me▪ whereat I was▪ as you may imagine, exceedingly aston∣ished,
<PB N="81" REF="032122_0210_0FF13B4B72DCD408"/>
and desired to know what he had seen in my behaviour, to authorize such proceedings? but he only laugh'd, at what he call'd my airs and begin∣ning to be intolerably rude, caught me in his arms, and having insulted me with language, too gross for me to repeat, avowed the baseness of his intentions.</P>
<P>On my crying out he begg'd me to be silent: to induce me to which, he added, that my noise would be but little regarded in a house of that kind.</P>
<P>Disengaging myself, I desir'd to know what he meant by casting reflections on my sister's habita∣tion?—but he would not enter into any altercation, and catching me again in his arms, notwithstanding my utmost struggles, would soon have overcome me, had it not have been for a great cry of fire, which made him leave me, in order to take care of himself; but luckily, the alarm was occasioned by nothing more than a chimney at the next house.</P>
<P>On running up stairs in my fright, I there found my good sister, whom I had imagined to be out, which added to what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had said, rais'd in my breast some thoughts, not much to her honour or hu∣manity, however, I thought proper to keep them to myself for the present▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ermining to be more circumspect for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></P>
<P>After expressing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>nishment at finding her there, I inform'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Hartrop's behaviour, and de∣sir'd
<PB N="82" REF="032122_0211_0FF12AD06320F350"/>
that she would never again leave me alone with him; in reply to which, she told me, "that she was just return'd home, and had, as well as myself, on the cry of fire, run up stairs," and then flew out in the most bitter terms against Har<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rop, saying, "that she was amaz'd at his insolence, in daring to offer any rudeness to a person beneath her roof,—and vow'd she would never speak to him again;—for that as I was under her protection, she should look upon it as an affront offer'd to herself, and would let him know it."—</P>
<P>In pursuance of this determination, she instantly wrote a note, wherein she acquainted him with her resolution, though, as I have since been informed, she took care that he should never receive it.</P>
<P>Thus by this well-counterfeited anger, did she in∣tirely hush my former suspicions, and I really be∣lieved, that she had no concern in the plot; though I am now convinced, it was a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> contri∣vance of her own to ruin me; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> affectionate cordiality of her behaviour, would not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> suffer me to entertain any thoughts injurious to her honour; and I was again giving myself up to the enjoyment of that golden dream of happiness, which my luxu∣rious fancy had painted, when my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> peace of mind, was at once destroyed, by the cruel artifices, of that base designing woman, under whose protec∣tion
<PB N="83" REF="032122_0212_0FF13B4F1E9E1AB0"/>
I had placed myself, and whom natural affec∣tion, should have made a second parent.</P>
<P>She one night, out of a pretended indulgence, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e said, to dispel that gloom from my countenance, which my father's death had occasioned: and which was not yet worn off, carried me to the play, which being a diversion I had never been partaker of, I was not a little pleas'd with my evening's entertainment.</P>
<P>When we came out of the theatre, to my great sur∣prize, the servant who had been ordered to meet us, was not to be found; and having looked for him some time in vain, least I should catch cold, by coming immediately from so intense heat, into the night air; my officious sister insisted on my stepping into an ad∣joining tavern, till a coach could be called, which I was too easily induced to agree to: and thus, under the hypocritical mark of friendship, and an affect∣ed concern for my welfare, did she seduce me to my ruin.</P>
<P>To my unutterable astonishment, I found that she was extremely well known at the house, and being at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>, conducted into a room, some wine was brought, of which I unluckily drank a glass or two, but do not remember any thing farther which passed that night.</P>
<P>I only know, that when I awak'd in the morning. I found myself in a situation not to be describ'd,—in
<PB N="84" REF="032122_0213_0FF13B5122E2CD28"/>
a strange room, depriv'd in one fatal night, of all, my soul held dear;—my virtue!—and my fame—when, to add to my misfortune, I saw in my undoer the villain Hartrop.—</P>
<P>Educated as I had been, with the strictest sense of female chastity;—think, Sir—oh think, what must be my sensations, at that dread moment,—grief, des∣pair, and anger, by turns possessed my soul:—I rav'd I tore my hair,—I beat my breast,—and was for some time, quite frantic.—</P>
<P>Exhausted passion at length gave way to the mod∣erate grief of reason, and I began seriously to con∣sider, that it was to no purpose, to attempt to revenge myself:—my honour was gone, nor was it in any human power to restore its spotless purity.</P>
<P>I might then, with strict propriety, repeat the lines of our mellifluous Waller:
<Q><L>O that I had my innocence again!</L>
<L>My untouch'd honor! but I wish in vain▪</L>
<L>The fleece, that by the dyer, once was stain'd,</L>
<L>Never again, its native whiteness gain'd.</L></Q></P>
<P>Although I was now thoroughly persuaded, that this was a mercenary scheme of my vile sister's; nevertheless, as she was the only person whom I knew in town, I weakly determin'd to apply to her, and flatter'd myself, that when she began can∣didly to reflect upon her actions, she might take pity
<PB N="85" REF="032122_0214_0FF13B56FB8B1678"/>
on my helpless injur'd youth and innocence; and therefore I immediately proceeded to her house, but was informed by the servant, "that she was out,"—</P>

<P>HAVING attentively revolved in my mind, what was the most probable method to gain a reputa∣ble livelihood, which would furnish me, if not with happiness, at least with temporary ease; I at length fixed upon the only plausible one that presented <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; that of going to service; which resolution, I communicated to my landlady, who generously be∣lieved
<PB N="87" REF="032122_0216_0FF13B5F470ACF88"/>
my story, and promised me her friendly assist∣ance, in getting a place.</P>
<P>In the mean time, I wrote to several people who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> formerly been friends of my father's; setting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orth my distress, and supplicating their relief,—from some I received no answer,—from others, scorn and reviling;—in short, mockery, contempt, and neglect, were the only returns I received for meekness and humility.</P>
<P>By the recommendation of my landlady, with whom I soon became a great favourite, by shewing an industrious disposition; I went after several pla∣ces, but my having no one to give me a sufficient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>racter, was a material and just objection, with every body.</P>
<P>I was thus therefore obliged to sit down contented with the misery of my situation, without any pros∣pect of comfort, for the present, or provision for the future; when to add to my wretchedness, I found myself with child; my money was near gone, and I now began to experience, all the torments of ap∣proaching penury and want;—my landlady was my only friend, and she, poor woman, had it not in her power to assist me far,—all that she could she did, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> amply possessed of humane feelings, those riches of the mind, tho' poor in worldly possessions.</P>
<P>When my time drew near, I grew more poignant∣ly
<PB N="88" REF="032122_0217_0FF13B65C9C39E58"/>
wretched,—my cloaths went piece by piece, for a present subsistence; and I was at last delivered of a dead child, being void of common necessaries,—with scarcely bread to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at, or garments to cover me, I have often since, wondered how it was possible to support myself, through so severe a trial, as I might have exclaimed with J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffier,
<Q><L>There's not a wretch that lives on common charity,</L>

<L>And never wak'd but to a joyful morning:</L>
<L>Yet now must fall, like a full ear of corn,</L>
<L>Whose blossom's scap'd, yet's withered in the ripening.</L></Q></P>
<P>But not to trespass on your time and patience, in this day of heavy affliction; I should certainly have perished, had it not been for the goodness of my charitable hostess, who assisted me, even to an injury of herself; and without her generous interposition, I should once have been turn'd naked, and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nnyless into the street, by a person to whom she owed some money, who said, that it was because she kept lodg∣ers, who could not pay, that he was so long depriv'd o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his due, and was therefore coming up to execute his cruelty, and at the same time to reproach me with my crime; when this good woman interpos'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my behalf, saying,—that if I was innocent, it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> inexcusable barbarism in him;—if guilty, I had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to bear, without the severity of his re∣flections:
<PB N="89" REF="032122_0218_0FF13B6774B295D8"/>
—which well-applied truth, had the desir∣ed effect, and sav'd me from immediate ruin.—</P>
<P>Amidst these accumulated misfortunes, I had still the satisfaction of knowing, they were not the con∣sequences of my own wickedness, and therefore, without any reproaches of conscience, had still those balmy inexpressible feelings, attendant on oppress'd virtue.—</P>
<P>Though I was unhappy, I was not yet culpable—O that I could now say so, with the same truth; and that I had never experienced the many miseries, which for ever wait upon once lost purity:—not∣withstanding all my sufferings, heaven endowed me with superior constitution, and I at last recovered strength; but what was the consequence?—to be∣come a scandal to my sex, and odious to myself:—without money, without friends,—and yet with some remains of beauty le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t;—what could I do?—I had no hopes from my unnatu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al sister; to procure a service I found was impracticable,—my character was gone; nor did I know any one, who would be responsible for my honesty.—</P>
<P>In these distressful circumstances, must I confess, to you, what course I took?—no,—you must but too easily guess it,—and save me the painful repeti∣tion of my guilt,—with reason may you shudder;

I do myself, at the horrid recollection; yes Sir, prostitution, shameful prostitution, was the lot of that person, who once <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad lived in all the splendour and expence of flattering indulgence; in which de∣testable, scandalous manner, I have existed for these two last years: but to recount all the various vicissi∣tudes of fortune, that I have experienced within that short space of time, would be tedious, and per∣haps offensive.—</P>
<P>Upon a general review, you would find me some∣times wallowing in all the affluence and dissipation, which luxurious fancy could invent; at others, bow∣ing beneath the complicated miseries of want, infa∣my and sickness, obliged for a present subsistence, to give up all thought of my eternal welfare, by sink∣ing myself a degree below the brutes, occasionally to flatter, and caress a man my soul abhored: if I look∣ed round, I saw none, but wretches like, or worse than myself, who dead to every nicer sense of shame, or honor, would prostitute their very souls for hire; oaths, blasphemies, and imprecations, were their con∣stant discourse: all which, and much more, than it is in the power of words to describe, I was obliged to undergo: how justly does Rowe, in describing the lives of these out casts of society, say,

Oh heaven! did women but seriously consider the gulph of wretchedness, into which they plunge themselves, when once they adopt vicious measures how earnestly would they endeavour to preserve their virtue, even though it were but in appearance; yet all this I could bear with patience, if I may be allowed the expression; my bodily sufferings, were the lightest part of my woe, they were trifling, in comparison of the reproaching stings of tyrant con∣science, which one minute's recollection, never fail∣ed to bring: if ever I thought seriously—it near turn'd me mad—I could not bear it—and, give me leave to observe to you, that it is for this reason we see so many of these unhappy women, in hopes of obtaining some respite from their tortures, as their only resource, flying to that odious vice of drinking, which, being what I could never be prevailed on to practice; I perhaps felt my misfortunes more severe∣ly than any other; for every moment informed me, how fatally repugnant, my present course of life was, to all hopes of eternal blessedness, though at the same time, I had it not in my power to take any step, tow∣ards procuring my pardon.—</P>
<P>For how could I attempt to open my lips in prayer to that God, in violation of whose most sacred laws I was daily living.—</P>
<P>This thought, from which notwithstanding my ut∣most efforts, my attention was scarcely ever divided,
<PB N="92" REF="032122_0221_0FF13B735B942A58"/>
harrowed up my soul, and strewed continual thorns across my path.—</P>
<P>Many, many times have I pray'd for death, to hide me and my shame, from the observing world; for where on earth, was comfort to be met with, for a wretch like me.</P>
<P>I have sometimes, in hopes of finding it, excluded myself from all society; but though I could fly far from the scene of guilty pleasures, still I could not upon myself—to have forgot my own wickedness, I must have resigned, or violently stopped all the pow∣ers of sensation; the former I could not do, and the latter I had grace enough to avoid.</P>
<P>I have endeavoured to drown recollection, in a continual round of noise and dissipation; but nature cannot always live upon the stretch; and if one se∣rious pause intervened, then, cried she, clapping her hand upon her breast, I found my judgment here; here I felt more than can be expressed.</P>
<P>The only amusement that endowed me with the least transient degree of tranquility, was reading; and that, tho' it molified my sorrows for the present, could not effectually divert my thoughts, from the only subject I detested: I too painfully found, that study and pensive retirement, though they may sooth for a time, in the main give additional force to na∣tural or acquired melancholy.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="032122_0222_0FF13B780A52C6C8"/>
After I have told you the heart rending trou∣bles, which we poor wretches are doom'd to suffer, and many others, that it is impossible for me to give you the least idea of; will you not be very much surprised, when I assure you that out of the number of unhappy prostitutes, which infest this town, very few are to be met with, who do not deserve the ti∣tle of sensible?</P>
<P>Impossible, you'll say, that sensible women would lay themselves open to the many miseries which, in such a state they must necessarily meet with—I agree with you, that nothing can be a stronger proof of their imprudence, tho' not of weak understanding: and sorry I am to add, that by far the greatest part of them may, with justice, attribute their afflictions to the perfidious hypocrisy of your sex; nay, parents themselves are frequently in a great measure accessa∣ry thereto: for if a girl, who has no other fault than her attachment to a worthless object of affection, has as is commonly the case, in an unguarded hour, been drawn in, under the most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> promises of marriage, to commit a trespass on virtue, she may for ever repent of▪ the doors of her parents, and the whole world, are instantly shut against her.</P>
<P>Without friends, without virtue—she must be an amazing instance of laudable prudence, not to re∣venge herself, upon herself by falling into a course
<PB N="94" REF="032122_0223_0FF13B79DD963030"/>
of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>:—and by thus making that vice, which before was but inattention, ruin herself forever.</P>
<P>Here I cannot help observing that the injustice of the world is no where more apparent, than in the distinction made, in the censures passed upon the frailties of the two sexes, is it not hard, Sir, that man, a lawless libertine, may roam, commit at large every folly, every vice which youth, intemperance, or his vicious inclinations prompt him to, and he shall not suffer in the eyes of the world?—when if woman, poor, weak woman, who being most liable to fall, should have greater allowance made, if she deviates ever so little from the narrow path of virtue, imme∣diate ruin is the inevitable consequence.</P>
<P>The generality of the world cruelly imagine, that when a woman has lost one virtue, she can never re∣cover that goodness of principles, she has so impru∣dently thrown away; but I stand a fatal example, to the injustice of such an assertion: however time im∣memorial, having rendered it, an almost thorough∣ly received opinion, every attempt to abolish it must be vain, and fall of itself.—Therefore to return to my story.</P>
<P>Being thoroughly satiated and harassed, with the infamy attendant on this deplorable course of life, I once determined, by learning some trade, whereby I should be enabled to get my livelihood in an honest manner, to draw myself out of it: for which purpose
<PB N="95" REF="032122_0224_0FF13B7D8F5B07C0"/>
I saved all the money I could, and learned the milli∣nery business.</P>
<P>Having the good luck to succeed therein, I had al∣most recovered my peace of mind, when another of the trade, envious of my success, sound means to steal a quantity of fine lace, belonging to a lady of quality, which was then in my possession.</P>
<P>There was no one but what believ'd me guilty of the theft or fraud—in vain did I assert my innocence—as I had no money to replace the goods, I lost my custom, and thought myself happy, in not being pro∣secuted for a robbery.</P>
<P>I now found myself in the same deplorable situa∣tion as before: at last was taken into keeping, by a single gentleman, which sheer necessity forced me to accept.</P>
<P>With him I lived much happier than heretofore; being no longer subject to the pinching <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of unhous'd poverty; and flattered myself, that by my behaviour, I should be able to retain his affections, till I'd saved money enough to re-establish me in my business, in some obscure corner of the kingdom, where my unhappy story was not known: but alas! I still was doomed to be the sport of fortune;—for the gentleman with whom I lived, coming home one day in liquor, found me talking to a young trades∣man, of whom I was ordering some goods; and tho'
<PB N="96" REF="032122_0225_0FF13B82D93DA3B0"/>
he did not mention any thing at the time, on his re∣turn in the evening, he stripp'd me, and having beat me in the most cruel manner reproached me with a crime I never had been guilty of, inconstancy to him; and, as a proof thereof, named the tradesman he had seen in the morning.</P>
<P>In vain did I protest my innocence: be turned me naked into the street, as you saw—where I should certainly have perished, had it not been for your unmerited, unexampled kindness.</P>
<P>This Sir, is my history, without disguise or palia∣tion; and if I have been guilty of great faults, I hope you will think them rather the consequence of irre∣sistable necessity, than cultivated vice—and that I am therefore more deserving of your pity than con∣tempt.</P>

<P>THUS, continued Sir Charles, did Miss Bar∣ton finish her painful history—throughout which
<PB N="97" REF="032122_0226_0FF13B85C68069D8"/>
there appeared such an air of unaffected ingenuity and perfect contrition, that I could not disbelieve her.</P>
<P>There is a certain charm in probity which strikes upon the mind, like light upon our eyes; conviction attends it; and if what she had told me was really true, as indeed I had no reason to suspect the contra∣ry, I thought her much to be pitied; nay own, I felt myself deeply interested in her future welfare:—therefore made her an offer of my lodging, which, with a great many apologies, for the trouble she had already given me, out of a principal of delicacy, she modestly declined, and would have instantly depart∣ed; but conscious that she had no other friend to apply to, and that neglect must renew her wretched scenes of life again, I would not suffer it:—I could not bear, that a person, whose temporal, and per∣haps spiritual welfare I had so much already contri∣buted to, should again throw herself away, from a punctilio of civility; and therefore insisted on her remaining where she was, till I could find her some employment in the millenery business, which I de∣termined immediately, to look out for; and to my great satisfaction, in a few days had the luck of meet∣ing with a person, whose health obliging her to re∣tire from London, she was willing to yield up her shop, on the condition of being paid half the profits thereof, during her life time: and with the recom∣mendation of my landlady, who procured security,
<PB N="98" REF="032122_0227_0FF13B87AD36C888"/>
I had in a short time the pleasure of conducting Miss Barton to her new habitation.</P>
<P>I never heard such expressions of sincere gratitude, as this generous, sensible, though abused creature made me: expressions were the only way she had of shewing it, and on my presenting her with ten pounds for immediate use, I had the inexpressible pleasure of hearing that she thought herself happy—and though I considerably distressed myself by assisting her, I must own, that an innate satisfaction, prefera∣ble to all the riches of this world, shed a pleasing balm upon my delighted heart.</P>
<P>I now found my cash reduc'd to a very low ebb, and therefore grew every day more solicitous about getting some employment; and as heaven will ne∣ver suffer any one to experience the least inconveni∣ency for having performed a good action; I, in a short time was recommended to a young gentleman, who was going to Antigua, to take possession of a large a state, and wanted a person to attend him as a <HI>companion de voyage.</HI> Although it was not my in∣tention to leave England, nevertheless as the terms offered me were very good, and as I was naturally of a volla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e disposition, I made no scruple of determi∣ning to accompany Mr. Morton to Antigua; and ac∣cordingly in a few weeks set <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l for that place.</P>
<P>Knowing that nothing was more likely to render dependence tolerable, than to acquire my patron's
<PB N="99" REF="032122_0228_0FF13B90B041B2E0"/>
esteem; I determined to find out his foibles, if he had any, that I might play my cards in the most suit∣able manner, without degrading my own nature.</P>
<P>By a little circumspection▪ I soon discovered that he was far from sensible—consequently exceeding vain of his personal qualifications—and not a little ad∣dicted to the fashionable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ollies of the age: but to give you, in two words, a just idea of his character, he might with the strictest propriety, be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a mere <HI>petit maitre.</HI></P>
<P>Thus circumstanced, I had nothing to do, but to use his own weapons against himself; and was there∣fore constantly approving the elegance of his figure, the neatness of his leg, &amp;c.—By which means I ingratiated myself so far in his favour, that before we arrived at the end of our voyage, my will was his▪ yet I never meant to make any bad use of my in∣fluence.</P>
<P>He was vastly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ond of hearing himself talk; but being unluckily endowed with no great powers of eloquence—he was obliged to supply this deficiency by art—and some trifling reading, joined to a tolera∣ble memory, furnished him with scope for superficial conversation, which consisted mostly of quotations, and commonly—the same over and over again.</P>
<P>It was his greatest glory, that he wanted nothing but a title, which he designed to purchase, on his
<PB N="100" REF="032122_0229_0FF13B93BB39FCC0"/>
return <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o England, to render him a complete fine gentleman.</P>
<P>Such was Mr. Morton, from whom I daily re∣ceived distinguished marks of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and es∣teem; and as a seafaring life was an entire novelty. I was not a little delighted with my voyage, which was completed in the usual time, of fair weather and favorably winds.</P>
<P>My patron finished his business in about two months—and a few days before the time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on for our return to England, made me his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an affair, of which I had not before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he least suspicion.</P>
<P>He informed me, that having danced, about a month before, with he daughter of an eminent plant∣er, he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that instant been desperately in love with her; and had accordingly made proposals to her father, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> refus'd, because if she married an Englishman, he must by that means, lose the pleasure of her company—which from his age and infirmities he stood not a little in need of, to support his droop∣ing spirits: but however▪ that the young lady, not having the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>jections to visiting England, which influenced her father, had kindly agreed to elope with him, the night before his intended voyage;—and he therefore begg'd my assistance towards the execution of his project.</P>
<P>I was not very fond of the affair, and attempted to remonstrate to him the dangers of a discovery; but
<PB N="101" REF="032122_0230_0FF13B9574B49590"/>
he was too much in love, to listen to any thing, but what the violence of his passion prompted: and see∣ing him thus firmly resolved upon it, gratitude would not suffer me to withhold my aid.</P>
<P>Having therefore previously prepared every thing necessary for the appointed night, Mr. Morton, my∣self and a servant, repaired to the destined place—where we waited a full hour beyond the time, where∣at we expected the young lady to have appeared—and considering that lovers ever run before the clock, our surprize encreased not a little.</P>
<P>At length my too amorous patron, beginning to grow very impatient, his beauteous dulcinea called to him from a window, and had only just time to in∣form us, that their scheme was discovered by the treachery of a servant; and therefore exhor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> us to provide for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>. So saying she retired—and we were about to do the the same, when to our great mortification, we found ourselves surrounded by six men; whose number however did not discourage us—and we, for some time, fought very obstinately, till Mr. Morton unluckily receiving a violent blow on the head from a cutlass, the person who had struck him, seeing him fall, instantly took to his heels, as did all his companions, leaving me and the servant who had accompanied us, to carry my unfortunate patron home, without any further interruption.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="032122_0231_0FF13B973703DCC0"/>
But alas! the mischief he had received was irre∣trievable—as the surgeon whom we sent for to exa∣mine his wounds, ingeniously declared, that he could not live till morning: and therefore advised him to settle his affairs; which having done, he called me to him, and desiring, that after his death, I would convey his will to England—put a purse into my hand, containing notes an I cash to the value of five hundred pounds—after which he received the sacra∣ment: and as the surgeon had foretold, at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ix in the morning died, in the flower of his age.</P>

<P>AS fortune now seemed to smile upon me, I flatter'd myself with the pleasing prospect of enter∣ing into some way of business on my arrival in Eng∣land; for which place, according to Mr. Morton's last desire, I set out in the first ship that failed; and as I had some fellow-passengers, who justly deserved the epithet of agreeable, the beautiful serenity of the

<P>As soon as we landed, we were carried to the Ba∣shaw's palace, who claims every tenth man, as his share of the slaves; and as I did not happen to fall to his lot, I was carried with the rest of my country∣men, into the public market-place; where, as there were but twenty of us, a Targe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een, a t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tle of respect given to the better sort of inhabitants at Algiers, came to bargain for us all; but seeing me of a puny make, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot robust enough for his work, he re∣fus'd to have me; and I was afterwards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old at a low rate, to a person who rather look'd like an over∣seer for some body else, than one who had bought me for himself: nor was I mistaken in my conjec∣tures, he carried me to my owner, who was a woman of seemingly about fifty years of age, and of a very forbidding aspect.—I was now put to my work,

<P>Thus situated, I had form'd a much worse opini∣on of slavery, than it deserv'd: or perhaps I was more lucky, in getting into this family, than many others, who had met with the same misfortune;—indeed, I could not accuse my mistress of the least severity,—she frequently eyed me when at work, with the greatest attention, and as I fancied, took peculiar pleasure in thus looking at me.—</P>

<P>As my mistress treated me rather with the famili∣arity of a friend, than the austerity of a superior, I was not, like other slaves, under the least restriction or confinement—wherefore rising one morning be∣fore the rest of the family, I hurried down to the sea side, hoping there to find some vessel, wherein to make my escape—but my eagerness leading me beyond the limits allotted to those in bondage, I was discovered by a spy, whose business it was to watch the conduct of the slaves, and carried before the vice∣roy, who sentenced me to the ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oon, for you must observe, that though individuals may treat their slaves with what lenity they please; nevertheless there are some general rules, which we are all oblig∣ed to conform to; but to proceed, the battoon is a punishment inflicted by a strong st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ff about six feet long, in the middle whereof, are bored two holes, through which a cord is put and fastened on the oth∣er side by large knots; by this means, the cord forms a loop, and both the feet of the offender being put therein, two men, one at each end of the stick,

day thus busied, she not a little surprized me, by the following discourse. "After my behaviour, said she, Mr. Hartry, for I had informed her of my name, it would be ridiculous in me, to pretend to disguise my sentiments any longer:—I do not mean it,—nor am I ashamed of them,—yes Sir,—I will freely confess my love for you."—"Love for me madam? interrupted I—Yes Sir, continued she, for you;—but hear what I have to say,—before you attempt to reply:—I have said that I love you, and as a proof thereof, will now place some confidence in yon:—I am a French widow, and possessed of a fortune large enough to render two people of moderate desires, completely happy, It is not, as you may imagine, from inclination, that I make this the place of my residence; the reason is as follows:</P>
<P>"About four years ago, which was a twelvemonth after my late husband's death,—a gentleman one day in private, attempted to take some liberties which were not consistent with his honour, or my virtue; when in the height of my resentment, I snatch'd his own sword that hung near me, and without giving myself time to consider the consequences, unhappily stabed him.—</P>
<P>"It was impossible for such an affair to remain long a secret;—and as I knew justice must inevita∣bly take her course, I had no other way of saving myself, but by flight:—therefore packing up what money and jewels I had by me, I escaped to this

place: where I have lived ever since, though it is far from my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, to end <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> here.—</P>
<P>"I have lately heard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> against me is dropped, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Paris with safety,—I shall i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> days set out for that place, and having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> regard for you—shall now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, by other ways than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> you an offer of my hand and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>."—</P>
<P>It is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for me to give you a just idea of my astonishment at hearing her talk thus, nor was my terror much inferior to my surprize—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> howe∣ever ardent my desire might be to regain my liberty, I could not think of purchasing it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such a price;—though at the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, as I knew her to be a wo∣man of violent passions, I did not know how much a refusal night wound her pride, nor to what lengths it might carry her—for which reasons, I determined to act with the greatest caution, least by exciting her resentment against me, she should be drove to any extremities, nor can I answer how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar this apprehen∣sion would have operated on me, had it not been suppressed by the recollection of poor Charlotte, for whom my affection was still most lively, however my manner of leaving her might indicate otherwise.</P>
<P>Conscious that it would be to no purpose to argue upon mutual affection with a woman of her violent passions, as my only resource, I determined to adopt
<PB N="109" REF="032122_0238_0FF13BB1A66B3480"/>
a fraud, which under such circumstances, I thought excusable—and therefore thanked her in the politest terms that I was master of for the honour she intend∣ed me; but added that it was impossible <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or me to accept of it, as my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and was already unluckily dis∣posed of in England, and assured her, that I should always conside<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er regard, as the greatest honour which could be conferred on me.</P>
<P>Then concluded by lamenting the perverseness of my fate, in thus putting it out of my power to ac∣cept her offer; while I was thus informing her of my resolution, I observ'd that she eyed me with great attention, and as I knew I was uttering a falsehood, I believe I spoke with a very bad grace.—</P>
<P>Having waited sometime in expectation of her an∣swer, she at last cried in a presumptuous tone:—"Very well, Sir—this is a good, a very plausible ex∣cuse, and had you thought of it sooner, I might have been a dupe to your mean subterfuge,—but I can now see through so poor, so shallow an artifice; I see that I am disagreeable to you,—but since you have had the audacity to provoke my resentment; beware the consequences,—dread the anger of a slighted woman: good heaven! that I should ever subject myself to a refusal from my own slave."</P>
<P>Hereupon I attempted several times to appease her rage, but in vain, she was so hurried away by her passion, when once her pride was alarmed, that she
<PB N="110" REF="032122_0239_0FF13BB363275420"/>
would hear nothing, and left me in no very enviable situation, as I knew I had every thing to fear from the violence of her temper.</P>

<P>IT has often been remarked that there are no lengths to which the anger of an offended woman, will not carry her, when like the troubled sea, and raging wind, contending in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it of lawless ire, which is the mightier;—both wild—and ungovernable, they suffer themselves to be hurried away by the rap∣id stream of passion, and will not suffer the noble pilot of our actions,—reason, to have the smallest power.</P>
<P>We indeed daily see instances hereof, though at the same time, we cannot be blind to the many ex∣ceptions which may be made to it; for some wo∣men there are, whom nature has fashioned in so meek and mild a mould, that they will rather subject them∣selves to a second injury, than attempt to revenge the first.—</P>

Such were the reflections which Madam la Bi∣joux's behaviour occasioned, and in which I was bu∣sied, when I was interrupted by the maid-servant, whom I before mentioned, and who came to inform me, instigated as she said, by her regard, of something that nea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly concerned my safety; that she had over∣heard her mistress tampering with two negroes to murder me, in the evening, on my road to a place, where she had promised to send me.</P>
<P>I sincerely thanked the honest girl for her intel∣ligence; and as the only method to escape <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he in∣tended blow, hastened to Madam la Bijoux, of whom having, on my knees, begged pardon for my beha∣viour, I assigned the following reason as the cause: That I imagined, she had only made so kind an offer, to see how for my presumption would carry me; but that having now found my error, I was willing to accept of her generous proposal, and should think myself ever happy in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>:—I believe she sus∣pected my being acquainted with her in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ention▪ by the hesitation she made; but as her passion was now subsided, and having as you will presently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, ve∣ry good reasons for her clemency, she was not long in resolving what course to take, and in a few days we set sail for France: on our arrival <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we were immediately married, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> proceeded to Paris.</P>
<P>Judge, if you possibly can, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was my surprize, to find myself▪ before I had been twenty hours in the place, arrested at different suits▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upwards of

five thousand pounds; being debts she had contract∣ed some time before.—In the most violent agitation of mind, I was hurried to prison, and now began to see the infamous traitoress in her true colours; es∣pecially as I was in a short time informed by the master of the hotel, where I had stopped on my ar∣rival, that she had left his house immediately after my seizure, without communicating to any one what were her intentions.</P>
<P>This affair, as you may suppose, made a great noise in the town, the major part of which was soon convinced of my innocence and as some of the principal inhabitants were kind enough to interest themselves in my behalf: I was soon released, and sound myself in possession of five hundred pounds, which the Due de Choiseul had, on hearing my sto∣ry, been generous enough to collect for me.</P>
<P>As soon as I was at liberty, my first business was to enquire after my wife; nor was it long before I had the mortification of hearing, that she was very well known at Paris, having long exercised <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> scan∣dalous profession in that place; during which time she had contracted these debts, which not being able to pay, she had cheated her creditors, by escaping to Algiers.</P>
<P>You may judge of the situation of my mind, on considering of my near alliance to such a woman; and surely I shall not be thought destitute either of tenderness or Christianity, for saying, that my grief
<PB N="113" REF="032122_0242_0FF13BBE3A3F77F0"/>
was alleviated, by hearing in a few days, that she was found drowned in a pond, near the suburbs; oc∣casioned as I suppose, by her apprehensions of be∣ing brought to public justice.</P>
<P>As a Christian, I sincerely lamented her unhappy fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, though without any of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he tender solicitudes of a husband.</P>
<P>Finding myself now in possession of five hundred pounds, and surely I may say, of some little experi∣ence, having been, in one week, a batchelor, hus∣band, and a widower; I bought a share in the shop where I first met you, and the other proprietor dy∣ing soon after, the whole business, which was pret∣ty considerable, devolv'd upon me; and in this situ∣ation I might have enjoyed an uninterrupted felici∣ty, had it not been destroyed by the continual ex∣pectation of happier days. And give me leave to observe, that the contententment o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> three fourths of mankind is hindered by the same method. Men lose their present pleasure, by looking for what is to come: and though many people are thoroughly convinced of this; nevertheless there is such a pow∣erful charm in hope, that we cannot help cherish∣ing it, and thus—foolishly sacrifice all our present felicity, to the emptiness of vain expectations.</P>
<P>But I beg your pardon, said Sir Charles, I am troubling you with reflections, occasioned by my own adventures; which can be no amusement or information to you, as they only tend to shew, that,

<P>IN this manner did our friends amuse themselves during their journey; and Sir Charles, notwith∣standing what he said, could not help enjoying the future in the present: he was innately happy, to think the time was near, when he was to be restored to the arms of his fond, expecting parent, and to meet all his soul held dear in the person of his Char∣lotte.</P>
<P>In the mean time, poor Melvill was distracted by the painful, suspended alternative of doubt and fear, wavering in his breast.</P>
<P>He could not bear the thought of seeing that wo∣man the wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of another, whose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he hoped to have been the chief instrument <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> and thus was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he unhappy Maria condemned as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, by a man on whom she do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted with the most extravagant fondness.</P>
<P>Our travellers at length landed at Doveri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

dusk of the evening, and were proceeding to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>own, when their assistance was called for, by a young man, whom two others were forcing into a boat against his inclination, and who having made all the resistance in his power, was nearly yielding to superior strength, when our two friends appeared in view, whose aid he begg'd with great earnestness, which as they never r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>us'd to innocence oppressed, they soon made the two ruffians quit their hold, and conducted the person they had rescued to an inn in the town—where as soon as lights were brought, fixing his eyes stedfastly on Melvill, he had only the power to cry, Good God! and fainted away.</P>
<P>Our travellers had observed the emotion in his face, and were ready to catch him as he fell;—and having, by the help of drops, &amp;c. brought him to himself; the colour no sooner began to come into his cheeks—than Melvill, with the like exclama∣tion, fainted away like wise.—</P>
<P>Sir Charles stood between them both, in the greatest perplexity, not knowing what to imagine from so extraordinary an accident;—however, he did not remain long in this uncertainty: for when Melvill came to himself—starting up he cried—"It is, it is Maria;" and was running to catch the stran∣ger in his arms—when woe-fraught recollection, stinging him like an adder—he retreated, and fixing his eyes in frightful stillness, exclaimed, "Yes, you are indeed Maria—but—" what? not Maria Har∣try,

no, "odious detested Clunch."—So saying, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll back in strong convulsions, into the arms of his friend; who now began to see a little more clearly into this misterious affair—Maria, for it was really her, stood trembling, and ready to assert her inno∣cence;—and forgetful of Melvill's present insensi∣bility, in a feeble voice interrupted with tears, cried, "No, poor mistaken Melvill—I am not the abject thing you think me—but I cannot blame you, ap∣pearances were strong against me—yet I am still Maria; the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ond maid you left me, and in that thought my happiness is complete."—Then catch∣ing her brother, though unknown to be such, by the hand, added, in a most moving accent—"Oh, Sir, did you but know my history—I am sure you would drop a tender tear, in pity of my woes: but do, dear Sir, persuade him of my innocence;—for innocent I am, you may believe m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>"</P>
<P>"I do, replied Sir Charles,—I will belive you, what I know you are, a miserable guiltless maid—I know your history, and know you both unfortu∣nate—but better times will come and soon: for still he loves, and oft to me has spoke of you in tender terms."</P>
<P>Melvill being now somewhat compos'd, our he∣roine disclosed to him every circumstance, which the reader has before heard—though it was not till after a long while, that he could be persuaded of the truth of what he heard.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="032122_0246_0FF13BCBCFA53408"/>
When he began to talk and think a little more col∣lectedely, and was convinced of the reality of his bliss—he caught the now happy Maria in his arms, and a most tender and affecting scene ensued—too tender, too affecting for my poor pen, even to at∣tempt a description of.</P>
<P>When they had indulged their mingled transports of grief, surprize, and joy, for some time, and an in∣terval of moderation gave them leave to think of something else besides their love; new wonders waited for them all to hear and see—Maria to find a friend, and long lost brother, for whom she had of∣ten figh'd in vain; but by whose presence all her past cares were far overbalanced—and with whom she at once congratulated, and condoled: congra∣tulated, on his accession to a title and fortune—con∣doled with him, for the loss of a tender and affec∣tionate father. These indeed appeared almost as mi∣racles to both our heroes; yet notwithstanding, the measure of their joy was now completely full, Sir Charles could not refrain from dropping a tear, as a tribute due to the memory of his father: nor did Melvill forget to sympathize with two such friends for their loss. When their mutual amazement was in some degree subsisted, Melvil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tenderly enquired of his Maria, by what strange accident, she had come into the situation, from which they had so happily delivered her.</P>
<P>"By the villainous artifices of a man, said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,

That I might be less likely to be rescued, he brought me these cloaths, in which he ordered me to dress myself; I dared not but to obey, &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> he hurried me down to this place, intending, I suppose, to carry me abroad, had not Providence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hus mercifully sent you to my assistance."</P>
