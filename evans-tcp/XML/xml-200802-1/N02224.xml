<SPEAKER>Simon.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHAT News at Town, Neighbour? Does the Assembly go into any new Matter this Sitting?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Timothy.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis said, <HI>Not</HI>: But they intend to break up this Day. If so, they will fail in the Charity, and o∣ther Services which seem to have been expected from them. Here's the <HI>Mer∣cury</HI> of Yesterday which has the Speech, and I have bought a new Book for Eight-Pence.— Read it.</P>

<SPEAKER>Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Title!— Why 'tis all Title, Man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sim.</SPEAKER>
<P>We'll lay this aside for reading at Leisure. Let us at present have some Consabulation, and take Care what thou say'st <HI>Tim,</HI> I shall write it down, and perhaps publish it; for I have a mighty Mind to be an Author. Methinks we are advancing in it. Is there nothing of it mention'd in this new Piece, as a necessary Improve∣ment in this new Country?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing mention'd! 'Tis no∣thing else Man! Every Line, almost every Word, the whole Book has it in View. But for all that, don't pretend to't <HI>Simon</HI>; thou canst never commence Author with thy shallow Politicks: There are many Qualifications (they say) necessary, which thou knowest nothing of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me but try: Do, help me, for I must have thy Assistance, and we'll make it Dialogue.— I love Di∣alogue. I've heard it commended of old.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="002652_0005_0FE5DB01A7031F20" MS="y"/>
<SPEAKER>Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>I help! no sure. At that Rate I shall commence Half-Author at least. No, no, farewel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee stay; think of the Plea∣sure of being an Author, especially <HI>an an an</HI>— What's the hard Word?— I mean, we'll put it out without a Name. Oh there's a deal of Pleasure in That! Ha! ha! — hum— (Excuse me) Now I have it,— <HI>Vertue is her own Reward.</HI>— We are to do Good secretly, we are to have no mercenary, no selfish Ends, no Party-Designs; and therefore want, nor expect no Honour, nor Applause from our Performance; confess how unequal we are to the noble Task, and hope it will be taken off our Hands by Persons of better Notions and brighter Conceptions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sim.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, That's not it: Most Authors pretend to some or all of those: But we'll be more honest, and profess to aim at our own Satisfaction in the pleasing Titillation which Au∣thors (secret and therefore modest Au∣thors) enjoy. First, let's think of some∣body that can't write, (at least to our
<PB N="6" REF="002652_0006_0FE5DB03467E1FE8"/>
Pitch) and find Means to insinuate 'tis his; then the Wit, the delicate Stile, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mooth Periods, and fine Turn of Expression, and especially the larding our Work with some Particu∣larities which will fit nobody else. All will turn upon us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay; but we can never reach any thing like that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, if we view our Per∣formances with any other than an Author's own Eye.—We shall have this Satisfaction however; if we make Blunders, if our Arguments are not cogent, if we fail in matters of Fact; if we fall into Inconsistences, we stand aloof, the Shot of the Readers fly over, or beside us. — O 'tis clever to have, or fancy we have <HI>Gyges's</HI> Ring.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>But won't that be some Mor∣tification, tho'?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all, or at least, 'twill be over-ballanc'd by the Pleasure on t'other Side; for the good Opinion Men generally have of themselves, is a well-wrought Corslet; and Censure, Conviction, or Remorse, rarely touch∣es
<PB N="7" REF="002652_0007_0FE5DB0457348D40" MS="y"/>
them; but if any body applauds our Work, (as 'tis much but some will, for that seldom fails, where there are Parties, or different Interests) this we receive and hug as if directed to us by Name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>But still methinks—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sim.</SPEAKER>
<P>What dost think! Am not I as well qualified as most Authors now-a-days. <HI>Projectors indeed under the Pre∣tences of publick Spiritedness and Pro∣motion of Trade secretly carry on their private Interest, and too often sacrifice the Publick to great Damage, if not Ruin.</HI> But for me, who can be more disinterested? I defy even the worthy Writers I have heard of, who laid out themselves most learnedly in a Garret, for the Preservation of the Constituti∣on, and of Liberty &amp; Property, or even <HI>De Foe</HI> himself when he wrote the <HI>Mercator</HI> to be more so.— They had a Standish to secure, and the In∣vasion of a Bailiff, perhaps, to guard against.— I have only this Log-House to be anxious for: And if the Propri∣etor of the Land should ever gain Power enough to turn me off, I can
<PB N="8" REF="002652_0008_0FE5DB051CA3F090" MS="y"/>
soon with the Help of my Neighbours the Freemen (whose Numbers we have a good Prospect of encreasing) whip up another on the next Vacancy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hah! Prithee, how didst get chosen two or three Years ago? Was it to get some Office, Annuity, or Sti∣pend? Art' one of the Four, or the t'other Four, or either of the single, disinterested Patriots who got more than either Set?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sim.</SPEAKER>
<P>No: I had a Mind to see the Town once more, and to be secure from impertinent People, not only for the Time being, but for the future by excellent Laws.— But do not lead me thus into Digressions: Let's talk to some Purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Talk,— What wouldst have me talk? I know not any Thing worth while, or to any Purpose as Matters go, somebody or other will be disgus∣ted; and few Care to be informed in any other Mode, but what sooths or confirms their own strong Opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let's to Dinner then, and take an Hour after to read the New Piece;
<PB N="9" REF="002652_0009_0FE5DB0A7A0F24D8" MS="y"/>
perhaps that may furnish with Matter, or supply all the good Purposes we can pretend to in relation to the Pub∣lick.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Post Meridiem.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now thou hast read it, and I have heard it a second Time, what's thy Opinion of it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sim.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are many pretty Things in it; several right Notions and true Positions, which are not the less use∣ful for being generally known. One would think the Author to be well skill'd in Trade, and the Advantages which redound to a Country by it, to be temperate, a good Oeconomist, and <HI>to keep true Accompts,</HI> as the <HI>Dutch</HI> phrase it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Canst add to't, or contradict any thing there? If not, lay aside the Whim of turning Author.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hey day! Why, is there no∣thing besides Trade and Riches worth thinking or talking on? Sure there are other Topicks; Prudence, Justice and Honesty are Qualities altogether as comely in a Government, and as ne∣cessary
<PB N="10" REF="002652_0010_0FE5DB0B5E72B168" MS="y"/>
to its Reputation and Continu∣ance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, then we shall have it: What! in this House! in the Circum∣stances just now confess'd, prate of Justice, <HI>Ha! ha! ha!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee don't grin so. <HI>Parsons</HI> tell the People, <HI>They must adhere to what they say, and not what they act.</HI> Some will inform us (a great Truth) <HI>That Rum and other Spirits impair the Heat of the Stomach, produce pining Di∣seases and lingring Deaths</HI>;— Com∣plain, <HI>That the Generality of People are so addicted to them, that neither Re∣gard to publick Interest or private, Bo∣dy or Soul, will divert them from the frequent Use of it</HI>: And yet these very Dictators miss very few Days in the Week wherein they do not begin in the Morning with that ruinous new Invention of <HI>White Bitter</HI>; and com∣pleat the Evening, which they would seem to design for chearful and impro∣ving Conversation, in full Loads of the pernicious and intoxicating Compound.</P>
<P>I knew a Steward once who de∣pended
<PB N="11" REF="002652_0011_0FE5DB0C262113F0" MS="y"/>
so much on the <HI>Maxim,</HI> as thereby to spoil all his fine Accounts; for whilst he was hugging himself, and vainly endeavouring to deceive others, by proper Colourings on par∣ticular Occasions; it came to that pass at last, that his Lord wanted no other than his own Letters, and the com∣paring them and his Actions, to be satisfied concerning the Gentleman.</P>
<P>He, at a certain Time, to gain a Point with the Tenants, harangued them upon the prosperous and flou∣rishing Condition they were in: And not long after, having Occasion to al∣lude to that very Time, in Vindica∣tion of some Combinations of his Te∣nants, mainly for his own Interest, he declares, that <HI>Laying to Heart the melancholy Scene of Affairs; and the low Condition they were at that Time reduced to, made those Concessions of Necessity.</HI> Further, after he had made some Rules concerning the Estate, di∣rectly contrary to positive Orders from his Lord, he so far forgot himself as to assert, that he <HI>had a constant due
<PB N="12" REF="002652_0012_0FE5DB0D80423538"/>
Regard to, and was never known to de∣viate from his Instructions.</HI> Many such Finenesses as these he had.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dost mention this with Appro∣bation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sim.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a Question there is?— Are such <HI>Proverbs</HI> as these of no Use in Life?— <HI>At Rome, do as Rome does, As good be out of the World, as out of the Fashion.</HI>— But Jesting a part, come then Neighbour, we'll preserve Cha∣racters. And since it seems, my Since∣rity or Integrity may be questioned, thou shalt be on that Side. I'll take to'ther. Thy Industry, Sobriety, Pro∣bity, and Modesty gives a just Right to aim at Reformation in others. Pri∣thee take the Hint, and go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told thee in the Morning I had nothing to purpose. What a mo∣dish Lover of Chat art thou?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sim.</SPEAKER>
<P>What ado is here? Like per∣swading a noted Singer.— Why put together a Parcel of clever Words; talk of <HI>Mediums,</HI> of <HI>Commerce, Bal∣lance of Trade, Pullick Good, Funds, Loans, Striking, Sinking,</HI> and such like.
<PB N="13" REF="002652_0013_0FE5DB0F79A683B0" MS="y"/>
No Matter whether understood, or not, by our selves or others, or whe∣ther we reason well and clearly, so as we make a fine Gingle. The common People will believe strongly what they are told is for their Interest, and for the few that may see the Trick, ne∣ver mind em; they may be halloo'd off?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a strange Creature art? To strain up a Character just now too valuable for me, and then put me up∣on so opposite a Part? No; But had I a Mind to say any Thing, or reason upon the present Posture of Affairs, I am too much confused, and at a Loss in what I hear and see. Some things may be dangerous, or inconvenient to meddle with; and in those, as well as the more common Themes, People are of different Opinions. To instance first, the Paper-Currency; some say <HI>it has been advantagious, Relieved the Necessitous, and quickned Trade at home and abroad</HI>; and many of these are for more (for can we have too much of a good Thing?) Others conceive, <HI>that
<PB N="14" REF="002652_0014_0FE5DAEE660CF398" MS="y"/>
the Relief given to one, was by oppres∣sing, if not defrauding another</HI>; That as to Trade, they allow <HI>it to have at first View such an Appearance; but is a Flash and Deception.</HI> They doubt it will have such an Effect as the <HI>Virgi∣nia</HI> Plant upon humane Bodies, <HI>create a false Joy, a</HI> Levalto <HI>in the Brain, but end in Sickness, Pain, and perhaps Death.</HI> These urge, <HI>That the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Building of Vessels and other late Push∣es in Trade are owing to the Apprehen∣sions Men were under, who must receive i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their Dues in such a Specie as in Time would sink in Value,</HI> (according to Presidents) <HI>and were willing to lay it out in Vessels and Goods, while the Project was young, and before the Value or Prices altered</HI>; and conclude, <HI>That all will subside again, and for the future be governed by Proportion, and the En∣couragement or Discouragement which may arise from Freights and Markets,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>That as Foreign Goods rise in Dispropor∣tion to our Produce, as may reasonably be expected, and is in Part already seen, the Burden which at first seem'd to be thrown
<PB N="15" REF="002652_0015_0FE5DB167A54D0C8" MS="y"/>
on others will fall upon the Planter and Tradesman.</HI></P>
<P>Besides, I cannot but observe the many Inconsistencies in the Opinions not only of divers, but the same Per∣sons. At first some were positive the Value of the Currency would not fall; now they see it, 'tis the Trick of Tra∣ders, and the Paper don't fall, <HI>but the Silver and Gold rises because it is scarce</HI>: Strange Position! By what do these People measure it? or by what Scale, I wonder, do they pretend to talk, or judge of the Benefits or Profits by Trade or Ballancing with other Coun∣tries? Is our imaginary Stuff the Cri∣terion? The same Person will tell us in one Place it was <HI>far short,</HI> in ano∣ther, that <HI>Excess of it will inevitably debase the Value; That the Expedient had relieved from Engagements with Honour and Justice.</HI> Again, <HI>That its Value ought to be kept up, otherwise it will prove an Injury to the Creditors, and be an Injustice in the Debtors to pay what is not the Value it ought.</HI> Was not, and is not this already done with
<PB N="16" REF="002652_0016_0FE5DB18D8283FF8" MS="y"/>
a Witness? Further, an <HI>Impost is pro∣posed on Foreign Liquors</HI>: And a few Pages after, 'tis <HI>wish'd the Government at home, would make all free.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sim.</SPEAKER>
<P>These, I think, may not all be Inconsistencies; to say <HI>Enough is neces∣sary, and of Utility, and too much, hurt∣ful and ruinous,</HI> seems not inconsistent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, as to that Part: But this may be designing; for unless the <HI>Quan∣tum sufficit</HI> be fix'd and agreed, there may be room to couch the worst Consequence under a Visor, until the Point is gained and too late to be un∣done, as seems to be very much the Case already, taking it in the whole; and thus well intending honest Men may be led Step by Step hoodwink'd to a Precipice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fix the Sum! That appears dif∣ficult to do: However the Legislators are the best Judges, or ought to be. They began with one Sum, and find∣ing that not enough, doubled, and so perhaps will go on from Time to Time as Necessity and Experience shall induce them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="17" REF="002652_0017_0FE5DB1A40B18D20" MS="y"/>
<SPEAKER>Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! In a Progressive Geo∣metrical Proportion! That indeed will in Time be enough for the Purpose of even the most zealous Promoters. And by the Way, many will be Push∣ers and Complainers until a <HI>NO∣THING</HI> can pay a <HI>SOMETHING.</HI> And these, or such as stand in some Degree towards them should unhap∣pily be the greatest Number—I— But I would choose to say no more on this Head; Only add, that ascer∣taining a Sum really necessary for com∣mon Circulation (if that must be the Case) I do not conceive to be so very difficult: Have not Political Estima∣tions of much larger Extent, been made and accounted, nay almost de∣monstrated to be very nearly exact. The Bulk of our Trade and Home-Commerce (for it is of no Use in our Foreign) which may demand a pre∣sent Deposit, is not hard to be come at: Therefore, these Projectors or Lead∣ers, since from the Nature of the Thing they own, that too great a Quantity will be ruinous, ought to be so honest
<PB N="18" REF="002652_0018_0FE5DB1B80CDC3C8" MS="y"/>
as to say at once, how much, and why no less is necessary, not arbitra∣rily, but demonstratively upon just Calculations; and these should be published some Time before they exe∣cute their Projects, that there may be Time and Room for Observation upon them; for sure Justice and Prudence require the utmost Caution where a whole Country and every body it trades with abroad, is so deeply con∣cerned. I would not be understood to be forwarding the Magical Contri∣vance. No, far from it, I am only cautioning such as may be mistaken, misled, or decoy'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sim.</SPEAKER>
<P>E'en now thou could find no∣thing to say. How cam'st by all this? and perhaps more; for there seems to be Reserves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>I get it, as honest plain Men should do, by conversing with such as reason clearly to my Apprehensi∣on and Judgment; not vilifying o∣thers with scandalous Insinuations and Falshoods; imposing nothing; but modestly leaving what they advance,
<PB N="19" REF="002652_0019_0FE5DB2037F91618"/>
to the Discussion of my own Reason; Men of real Interest in the Country, and who, I'm well satisfy'd, do, as well from Principle, as ty'd by that Interest, wish well to it; have served it without mercenary Ends, and are capable of it still. I will not make Comparisons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! <HI>Tim,</HI> art thereabouts? I doubt these are the very Men figu∣red to be so dangerous to the Coun∣try's Good, (that is Paper-Money) and render'd so unfashionable two or three Years ago. Some of them had got Money (a most obnoxious Case at that Time, however justly and ho∣nourably they came by it) and trust∣ed others with a Part of it, and ex∣pected the poor Debtors should pay them again, when Money was gone, so very scarce; was not that Oppressi∣on?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>To enter into any Debate on that Head, is unhappily out of Time, and useless; and would therefore now be ridiculous. I shall only say, Who∣soever of the Debtors had Country-Produce,
<PB N="20" REF="002652_0020_0FE5DB246E947810" MS="y"/>
or any Thing else to buy Money with, (if that be a proper Ex∣pression) might procure it. And as to those whom it was one Part of the Scheme at that Time, to render ob∣noxious, in Order to cast a Mist on the manifest Injustice intended them, it is well known how forbearing and easie most of them were, and how few Law-Suits: Nay, none but where was apparent Danger of suffering, were commenced by them. And how ready and willing, nay desirous they were to take the Country-Produce; for those I am acquainted with, affirm they never refused it. But enough of this; I shall remark, that 'tis no new Thing for artful designing Men to traduce the best Patriots and most beneficial Mem∣bers of a Common-wealth. History is full of it: Nay, what flagrant In∣stances thereof in our Mother-Coun∣try, not many Years ago, can our own Memory recollect. Such here, as were so used, I must confess I have the greater Opinion of, and have sought their Conversation the more, in that
<PB N="21" REF="002652_0021_0FE5DB27A630B3F0"/>
I perceived there did not want Emu∣lation, Malice, and Excitement<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> e∣nough to have charged them severe∣ly had there been a Cause. These, tho' they preserve their Judgment free, yet sit quiet and aim at Contentment and Peace. In Hope that the Ferment will work off, they are, I am well as∣sured by what I gather from conver∣sing with them, pleas'd to see that Providence has not quite forsaken us; that there are a Number of well in∣tending Men in some Degree of Power still as a Ballance, and rejoice at any Thing which tends to the Country's Benefit (when they see it) from what Hand soever it comes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah <HI>Tim,</HI> dost think to slide in an Opinion of these Men? Dost think to bring any of them into Play again? The Country will hardly trust them in these Times. —They are better in∣formed. —Care is taken of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Art and Cunning of some People is indeed notorious; and we are drove to that pass that there seems little Enquirie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> into the Abilities or
<PB N="22" REF="002652_0022_0FE5DB2D720D6E48" MS="y"/>
Probity of Men; but the single Que∣stion is, <HI>Whether he be for or against Paper-Currency,</HI> and that's the Stan∣dard and Rule: Not considering, as I assuredly know, That true Patri∣ots will not, must not be so sway'd by their private Opinion in any one Point, as to run the Publick into Con∣fusion or Ruin. No, a good Pilot will steer and work the Ship, accordingly as the Wind and Weather, and sur∣rounding of Rocks, Sands, or Shores, will admit him; and if he cannot get clear with Safety on a strait Course, he must make the best on't by plying, or else anchor a-while till the Tide or Wind turn. Preservation, and a steady Pursuit of the Voyage is all His Care.</P>
<P>But to return to what I was a while since saying of Inconsistencies; would it not give the Spleen, or ra∣ther make one wonder and smile at the Assurance of some People in the Contrivance and Conduct of their Schemes. Men are cry'd out against for taeking lawful Interest, tho' as low as in any, and lower than in most
<PB N="23" REF="002652_0023_0FE5DAEF38ACAEA8" MS="y"/>
of the Plantations. Advertisements were published to brand them with Usury, to incense the People, and pre∣vent their being elected, and immedi∣ately (nay, 'twas even then concerted) the whole Power of Government set up the Trade; for what Ends and private Purposes, there may come a Time when it will be no Crime to shew. But sure none can think such the less Sinners by Proportion as <HI>Six</HI> is to <HI>Eight</HI>; for Casuists will hardly allow, that <HI>to abate in Degree, absolves the Sin.</HI></P>

Without Justice, Tem∣perance, and Industry in lawful Cal∣lings, we can neither thrive laudibly in this Life, nor answer what is requi∣red of us towards Bliss in the next. I could enlarge and exemplify on this Head. Many Instances occur; but I

a modest Man. But I confess, I could not but take Notice of the Formality of the Argument, and fancy the Author had read some of the fashionable Sermons of the middle of the last Century. I would not doubt however, but 'tis well under∣stood by the Wise and Learned, or those who know the proper Method of wri∣ting these kind of popular Things. But for me, I confess I was so simple as to imagine it intended that I should believe that laborious, industrious People (such as <HI>Palatines,</HI>) are to make us rich without Extent of Land or its Fertility, or a great deal of its Produce; and even without People (<HI>simply</HI>) and that without all these, <HI>Wheat, Hemp,</HI> and all the enumerated, are to be raised and produced.</P>

<P>Well, since thou wilt have it, I'll go on with my Negatives, without further Ceremony. But perhaps 'twill not be readily found how my silly Tale may affect a Country's Thriving. Politicians and Projectors will laugh at it, unless it may slide in by Way of Episode before we have done.</P>
<P>I began with a little, and after my Time was out, I did not presently get a fine Horse, and ride about spunging on one honest House-Keeper or another, idling half the Year, unless I could get such Wages as the industrious Farmer could not afford, which I knew however, he must give, in Corn and Hay-Harvest: But hired my self to my old Master at mode∣rate Yearly Wages, until I had paid for the first Hundred of my Land. Then set to Work, clearing some of it in the
<PB N="28" REF="002652_0028_0FE5DB2F00462508"/>
Winter, and wrought at Wages in Sum∣mer; by which Means I had enough to support me, and provide Necessaries till I got a House and a Crop. I soon got out of some small Debts, which this necessi∣tated, and managed so, as to be no more any thing considerably involved.</P>
<P>I never went to Markets, Fairs, or the Town, but when my Business called me, and was such as would compensate the Time and Charge. When there, I never sate tipling the Day out, and then ride home in the Night to destroy my Health, and unfit me for Business the next Day. My Wife (for I married the second Year of settling) was loving and industrious; She spun so much Linnen and Woollen as to be pretty well stock'd before Encrease of young Children took her off. And by that Time, thro' the Blessing of God on my Industry, I had got enough aforehand to afford her a Maid, and soon after, my self a Man. Our Children grew, and help'd us on bravely, so that I added to my Land a Piece to settle one Son, and began it, and have agreed for another, ha∣ving wherewithal to pay for it.</P>
<P>I never gadded about, chaffering with, or for Horses. I observed the Time spent, and Charge of keeping them fine and high for Sale, did not answer even to the Jock∣eys.
<PB N="29" REF="002652_0029_0FE59B97824DE3B8" MS="y"/>
I kept no more than were necessary. But what I raised and could spare from Plantation-Use, I disposed of, as any Neigh∣bour wanted, at moderate common Rates.</P>
<P>I never, or very rarely slipt the proper Seasons for the respective Parts of my Bu∣siness, unless put off by Weather or Sick∣ness, or some Interposition of Providence, under which I always made my self sub∣missive and chearful; and by Precaution and Diligence, beginning early, and losing no Opportunity by Pocrastination, or any body telling me, 'twas Time enough. I sel∣dom suffered, but when the Disappointment was general. I observed and copy'd after the most industrious and improving of my Neighbours, took all Opportunities of be∣ing inquisitive concerning their Mode of Management, and their Experience, and was as free in communicating mine.</P>
<P>I never burden'd my Neighbours with rambling or trining Visits, tho I loved to be sociable, and we saw one another of∣ten, but contrived it so, as not to be inju∣rious to either of our Affairs by Loss of Time. Nor did I ever delight (however it comes to pass, that I am prevailed on to dip into it now) to turn Politician or Statesman. And whensoever Publick Af∣fairs would fall in, I never join'd in, but opposed censuring Men and Things I knew
<PB N="30" REF="002652_0030_0FE5DB33A95B72B8" MS="y"/>
little of, at least nothing but well; for I observed <HI>That,</HI> generally arose from the Charterings and Vanity of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our Fire-Side Companions, such as are generally (I have been well-informed) insignificant, or meer Tools elsewhere, who over a Dram or a Mugg without Doors, make all the Laws, and do all the Business. And be∣cause they may have been genteelly bow'd to, taken by the Hand, or perhaps hugged and kiss'd, become inflated, and imagine themselves of the greatest Importance.</P>
<P>Keeping clear of Debt I never did Ca∣bal, or suffered my self to be Cajol'd upon the Choice of a Sheriff, which now ridi∣culously seems to be made the main Busi∣ness of the Country. I always thought any Honest Capable Man, who would do his Duty without Injuring or Fearing any Body, more fit than such as make their Court to, and stand in awe of the Crowd, from whence, as 'tis said, arises, abundance of <HI>Non-ests.</HI></P>
<P>I go to <HI>Elections,</HI> because I think it my Du∣ty, but confess my self almost tired of it.— To see the vile Abuses of our Rights and Li∣berties, and how easily the better and more modest of the People give into it. Many of them seem to think and act as if a Set of busy Fellows were appointed by Law to make the Tickets, and the People had only a
<PB N="31" REF="002652_0031_0FE5DB35A2AF6118"/>
Right to choose which they liked best: The worthiest Men those People know to be the most Modest and Decent in their Behaviour, and make Advantage of it, by timely Provision, Clamour, Noise and Im∣pudence. I must confess, I stood amazed at the <HI>Tann'd</HI> Impudence of a Fellow two Years ago, who stood upon the Stairs with Heaps of prepared Tickets; asked to see mine as I was going up; I was not forward to shew it, but being between my Thumb and Fingers, he took it, look'd on't, and then told me it was not the right, would have kept it; and offer'd me another, as it seems he had managed several. With some Trouble I got mine again, but so pro∣voking was the Looby's Conduct, that our Neighbour <HI>Evan</HI> (his Blood being up) ask∣ed me, why I did not spit in his Face.</P>
<P>I never could join with those who were caballing against the Town, and contriv∣ing Mischief, and Discouragement to it, because I plainly saw it generally arose from Envy, Malice, and Ignorance of the Country's true Interest; and that in the Prosecution of their Projects, Passion and Folly lead them; and their Notions were mostly Chimerical, aim'd (erroniously) to support their own Idleness, or indulge their Spleen: For I always judg'd the O∣pulency of Towns to be the Advantage of
<PB N="32" REF="002652_0032_0FE5DB3667644E08" MS="y"/>
every industrious and frugal Country-Man. And here I cannot but lament and wonder at the prevailing Politicks of late to cry out against Merchants and rich Men, (alas we have too few) and at the same Time talk and bluster of promoting Trade and Navigation. Every Body that knows any Thing of the Matter, knows that these can never be carried on to general Benefit, without Men of good Stocks, with Skill and Ability for the Purpose: And there∣fore where we have one such, I could wish we had twenty, or at least a Num∣ber proportionate to the Exports and Im∣ports which the Country requires. It is not every Farmer, or any other uncertain Nibblers at it, with half a Tun or a Tun now and then of Flour (tho' all are, and should be free) will promote Trade, of draw a general Ballance; it must be done by such as are able to bear a Loss or Dis∣appointment without giving off, but con∣tinue on with Endeavours to retrieve them; that are provided with Vessels, some or o∣ther of them, at all Times, even when they appear most discouraging, and are thereby obliged to push for and try vari∣ous and new Markets; such as obtain con∣tinual fresh Advices; that know the pro∣per Seasons and usual Consumptions a∣broad. Those are in the Sense I am speak∣ing,
<PB N="33" REF="002652_0033_0FE5DB37F5CDE918" MS="y"/>
Agents or Servants of a Country; if they thrive and reside in it, the Country has the Gain, and it will disperse.</P>
<P>I would not be understood to be against any Adventurers, tho' their Stocks be small, but heartily wish Prudence and Suc∣cess to all, as having, I imagine, a Share in it, but would shew that if we envy and endeavour to discourage the Able among us, or such as may be growing to it, we are utterly in the Wrong, and shall lay our selves at the Mercy of Foreign Tra∣ders, which, upon Experience, would be found very disadvantageous, when they should be check'd and ballanc'd, by having Merchants of our own. Both indeed do best together; the one a Country should look upon and cherish as Children, the other as hired Servants.</P>

<P>I must beg a Repitition of this by-and-by, and confess my Failure of due Attention, being diverted by listening to my pretending Cousin there. See, he has got the Book, and has been endeavouring to impose upon poor <HI>Jenny.</HI> The Mi∣mick has been laying forth in Method and Form,
<Q>That 'tis not large Fields, nor good Grass in them, nor a great deal of Butter and Cheese made, nor her simple Hands that will get her a Por∣tion, but she must ballance Trade with
<PB N="34" REF="002652_0034_0FE5DB395DBDB178" MS="y"/>
every individual Person she deals with.</Q>
She sat staring and gaping, while he has been haranguing and running over all her Advan∣tages; the <HI>Turkeys,</HI> the <HI>Hens,</HI> the <HI>Geese,</HI>— the <HI>Eggs,</HI> the <HI>Wool,</HI> the <HI>Flax,</HI>— the <HI>Apples,</HI> the <HI>Butter,</HI> the <HI>Cheese,</HI>— the <HI>Honey</HI> and the <HI>Wax,</HI>— and because he would be regular, and make up an Even Dozen, he added the <HI>Straw</HI> for making warm Nests. He just mentioned the Pye-Crust too for Home-Use, if she would but <HI>do her Part</HI>; but the Wag would not vex her, I perceiv'd by telling how black, and tough, and thick she made it, lest she should refuse to get his Dinner, or make his Bed. <HI>Jenny</HI> at length bid him ha' done with his <HI>Ribble-Rabble</HI>; for he had not told her any Thing (that was intelligible) which she did not understand better than he, how to manage and improve; for he had inform'd her nothing, unless it should be in what he said of <HI>Sympathetical Attraction,</HI> and <HI>Antipa∣thetical Repulsion</HI>; there might be something indeed in That; for a finical Sweetheart of hers once talk'd like it. Then as to ballan∣cing with every individual Body she dealt with, she could say little; only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was sure she had nothing but Shoes from the Shoe∣maker, and they wore out, and yet she must deal with him, or go barefoot.

<P>Shrewd <HI>Jenny.</HI>— I think I may draw to a Conclusion, for I have a mind to close with something general, if I can but express what has sometimes taken large Room in my serious Thoughts, in Words few enough to be heard patiently.</P>
<P>I have indeed been sunk in my Spirits, and ready to weep at the melancholy Pros∣pect before us. The Honesty, Sobriety, Industry, religious Concern of Mind, and
<PB N="36" REF="002652_0036_0FE5DB3E5A15E6F8" MS="y"/>
Openness of Heart one towards another, which so apparently and beautifully ac∣companied, and were the Characteristicks of most of our first Settlers, seem (too much of it) to be gone down to the Grave with them. At <HI>Fairs, Markets,</HI> Country-Vendues, and almost all Times of Con∣course, (and O that I could say those in∣tended as religious Services, and Visitati∣ons of Charity and Love were wholly free!) How does Levity, Rudeness, and the de∣plorable Custom of Excess in spirituous and intoxicating Liquors prevail, and es∣pecially that of <HI>Dram, Dram,— Dram</HI> up∣on <HI>Dram! When Things are at the worst,</HI> 'tis said Proverbially, <HI>they'll mend.</HI> May there yet be Room to hope it. I almost despair of many of those advanc'd in Years, who have long indulg'd themselves there∣in, and seem by Habit and the Loss of <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Reason,</HI> to be abandon'd to it. But O that the young and the yet innocent, may, from the Sight and Abhor∣rence of this Abomination, this Debasement of humane Nature, with the many Evils which are the inseparable Consequences thereof, resolve and guard against it. I would not call it Brutishness. Beasts are free from such an Abuse of themselves. Instinct is ap∣pointed to them, Reason and Religion to us. They act steadily. Mankind deviate
<PB N="37" REF="002652_0037_0FE5DB3FC5BF4C58" MS="y"/>
grosly. The <HI>Good-Fellows,</HI> as they call them∣selves in one of their Songs, (the preten∣ded Wit a-part) own this, when they say,
<Q><L>He that drinks least,</L>
<L>Drinks most like a Beast.</L></Q></P>
<P>Would (I say) but the <HI>Rising Generation</HI> steer clear of this fatal Rock, while the Disuse is easie, and the Use uncouth to them, and rather a Violence upon their Nature, we might yet hope for he Continuance of Bles∣sings, and a <HI>thriving</HI> and <HI>flourishing</HI> Country.</P>
<P>Since the baneful Practice is become so general, I perceive it is proposed the Go∣vernment should take it in Hand. I could heartily with it in their Power: And that preventative or discouraging Measures might or could be taken to Effect. <HI>Rum</HI> being the most common Spirit, an Impost, it seems, is offer'd as the Means. If such a La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> could prohibit the Personal Excess, it might do something; but the making it dearer, is only to encrease the Publick Re∣venue, at the Cost of these unhappy Peo∣ple who are so ty'd to it, that they would rather go naked, than be without it. And to propose the encouraging of Distillations in its Stead, is to turn off the poor Crea∣tures the sooner; for <HI>Rum</HI> (tho' the Excess of it is very injurious) is accounted (I pre∣sume
<PB N="38" REF="002652_0038_0FE5DB46EE302C48" MS="y"/>
not unjustly) more wholesom than any of our usual Spirits; and it may be demonstrated is generally purchased with our own Produce cheaper and more ad∣vantageously, by employing our Vessels, and all that depend on them, than Distil∣lations from any Corn (as has been propo∣sed) if not any other Materials, all things consider'd. Besides, 'tis worth Considera∣tion, whether to encourage Distilling, un∣less we had a Vent abroad for it, would increase the pernicious Custom of Dram-drinking. We see what Methods are ta∣ken by most of these already in the Occu∣pation, to promote and tempt to the Use. I say then, since it would be impracticable or ridiculous to make a Law, that none should drink a Dram, or to direct how many of them, or how much of <HI>Spirit</HI> mixt, any one Body shall take; and that an Impost will not prevent the Abuse, what else the Government may prudently fall upon, must be waited for. Mean Time, it must, I think, be left to every-body's Care for themselves, by the Reason and Judgment God has given them. When I spake e'en now of a thriving and flourishing Country, I would not be understood that I imagine we are stated for acquiring such large and unweilde Estates, as many in other Colo∣nies and Plantations obtain. What may in
<PB N="39" REF="002652_0039_0FE5DB4888389570" MS="y"/>
Time be the Effects of new Products and Discoveries, I shall leave. The present Time and Care is ours; succeeding Gene∣rations will have theirs. But Happiness, if we think rightly, consists in the Golden Mean, to be free from Straits and Penury, on the one Hand, and the Temptations to Luxury and its Crony-Vices on the other. This was a celebrated Prayer of old: And as we really exceed all the <HI>West-India</HI> Co∣lonies, and most of the other Plantations in all the wholesom necessary and (in a ju∣dicious Sense) delicate Provision for Life, Health and manly Satisfactions; Prudence and good Judgment will account us hap∣pily situated: But if we do not think and find it so, the Fault is our own.</P>
<P>Let us take a View; let us not be blind to the great Blessings we enjoy; a health∣ful Climate, and productive Country; neither Soldier, nor mercinary Bands of any other Denomination, burden or injure us. The Natives, whom our Predecessors found in Possession, we have always liv'd peaceably with, and they love us. We have none of those opulent powerful Men, which are in some Parts of the World to oppress or enslave us. If any here arrive to a Figure above their Neighbours, it must be, as 'tis directed, or commanded in another Case, <HI>by becoming as Servants
<PB N="40" REF="002652_0040_0FE5DAF4DD6613C8" MS="y"/>
to them.</HI> And I presume it will not be deny'd by any body, who by travelling, or reading, knows any Thing generally of the World, but that the Rank among us who are in other Places called <HI>the common People,</HI> may challenge the whole Globe to compare for <HI>Ease, Freedom, Sufficiency</HI> of Necessaries, and a general Equality. In a Word, LIBERTY is ours; may it never be call'd LICENTIOUSNESS! What remains then, but that we lay aside Wanton∣ness, Prejudice and Folly; love one another, and study Peace.</P>
