</EPIGRAPH>
<P>CIVIL government is an institution appointed by God, for the good and well-being of man∣kind. The necessity and importance of this insti∣tution may be inferred from the wisdom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd goodness of him who hath appointed the same. The divine being has seen fit to establish his law, as a perfect, unerring rule for men to walk by▪ a due regard to which is the foundation of all true hap∣piness. And were every one disposed to walk agreeably to this rule, it would supersede the ne∣cessity of any civil establishment; for then every one would do to others as he would have them do unto him. But such is the unhappy state of man∣kind, since the apostacy, that they are disposed, every man to seek his own, and not the thing of another. And if there is nothing to prevent their covetous desires, and wicked pursuits, but their own consciences, and the divine law, the penalty of which none can inflict but God only, they will lie, and steal, and destroy both themselves and others. Hence arises the necessity of civil government, which
<PB N="6" REF="021401_0004_0FB38475CD6B0730"/>
God, in his infinite wisdom, has seen fit to establish, and which, duly administered, is the foundation of the peace, order and happiness of civil society; and is one excellent mean to advance the peace, order and happiness of christian society; so that the in∣spired writer (speaking of civil government) says, <HI>If the foundation be destroyed, what can the righteous do,</HI> Psal. x. 3. King David had peculiar advantage to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> what influence the one had upon the other, as he was called in the early part of life, not only to fill an important <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat in the civil department, but also to fill a more important one in the religious department▪ to be a type and forerunner of Christ, the great head of the church. And as the faithful admini∣strations of government in these two different branches, is of vast importance to mankind, so he earnestly prays for each; <HI>Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness,</HI> Psal. cxxxii. 9. <HI>Give to the king thy judgments, and thy righteousness unto the king's son; that he may judge the poor, and save the needy, and break in pieces the oppressor,</HI> Psal. lxxii. 1. 4. David was now old and stricken in age; his long improv∣ed judgment, which was ripened with the experience of many years, qualified him to give the best advice in matters of the greatest importance: <HI>For days shall speak, and the multitude of years shall teach wisdom,</HI> Job xxxii. 7. The words of the text come with peculiar weight and solemnity, as they are the last words of a dying prince, giving advice to his sur∣viving kingdom; and are therefore worthy to be∣come the object of our serious attention and diligent enquiry at this time, which will be in the following manner.</P>

</LIST>
<P>I. It is the will of Heaven, that there should be civil rulers.</P>
<P>Moses was called immediately by God to take the rule and government of his people Israel. Saul, David, and many others, received their royal crowns by special direction from heaven. Not only kings but those who fill stations of less importance in civil government, are equally appointed by God, as may be seen, Prov. viii. 13. <HI>By me kings reign, and princes decree justice; by me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.</HI> Our Saviour was subject to their authority, and paid tribute, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was demanded of him. And the apostle Paul is very particular in the point. <HI>Let every soul be sub∣ject unto the higher powers, for there is no power <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t of God; the powers that be, are ordained of God:</HI> Rom. xiii. 1. The apostle Peter enjoins the same; <HI>Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man, for the Lord's sake; whether it be to the king as supreme, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> governors as unto them that are sent by him, for the punishment of evil doers, and for the praise of them that do well;</HI> 1 Peter, ii. 14. God has testified his will, in the establishment of civil rulers, in requiring that <HI>supplications, prayers and intercessions be made for all men, for kings, and for all in authority, that we may lead a peaceable and quiet life, in all godliness and honesty;</HI> 1 Tim. ii. 1, 2. And in that we are forbid to speak evil of rulers: <HI>for it is written, thou shal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not speak evil of the ruler of thy people;</HI> Acts xxiii. 5. Also from a consideration of the great use which
<PB N="8" REF="021401_0006_0FB38478CD56DB20"/>
God has made of them in days past, and the use which he says he will make of them in time to come▪ when he will pour out his spirit, and cause his church to increase, and become universal; even then <HI>kings shall be their nursing fathers, and queens thy nursing mothers;</HI> Isa. xlix. 23. <HI>Thou shalt also suck the breasts of kings, and thou shalt know that I the Lord, am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer;</HI> Isa. lx. 16. These passages, from the many that might be ad∣duced, are sufficient to show, that it is the will of Heaven, that there should be civil rulers. I now pass on to show in the</P>
<P>II. Place, that it is required of those who rule, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they be just men. And this will appear, if we consider the nature and importance of the business assigned them to do:—as they are appointed to use their power to suppress iniquity, and all acts of in∣justice. It is exceedingly natural for the human heart to break forth into those acts of wickedness and impiety, which are dishonorable to God, and destructive to the happiness of human society. The hearts of the sons of men are full of evil, <HI>and be∣cause sentence against an evil work is not speedily exe∣cuted, their hearts are fully set within them to do evil;</HI> Eccle. viii. 11: and madness is in their hearts while they live. Notwithstanding Heaven is continually using the most powerful means to curb those wicked passions, and prevent the outbreaking of injustice—such as the various calamities and sorrows of life, which fill the world with pain and distress; the terrors of death, the alluring prospects of a heavenly paradise, and the fearful glooms of eternal dark∣ness; yet mankind will break over these restraints, as if they were but shadows, or mere cyphers of no avail: and if there was nothing more, the earth
<PB N="9" REF="021401_0007_0FB3847A4DDE3F48"/>
would be filled with violence. But God has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pleased to appoint other means:—even civil rulers, who by the blessing of Heaven, have oftentimes curbed those wicked passions, and prevented their breaking out into open acts of injustice.</P>
<P>Rulers are appointed to stand in the gap, and draw the sword of civil justice against all open of∣fenders, and so to become a terror to evil doers: and the nature of their business, and design of their office is such, that no one can act in the character of a faithful ruler, but he who is just:—there is no way to prevent the growth of injustice, but only in a way of justice. The prevalency of some things may be prevented many ways, but the prevalency of injustice can be prevented only in one way, viz. in a way of justice: therefore it is required of those who are appointed to suppress acts of injustice, that they be just men.</P>
<P N="2">2. It will further appear, if we consider that the ruler is appointed to defend the liberty and proper∣ty of his subjects. Liberty and property have ever been the objects of lawless ambition and avarice. An unbounded desire to have dominion over these, has been that great spring which has moved those migh∣ty wheels, which have brought on those revolutions which have taken place in the rising and falling of kingdoms and empires. What inspired Alexander, the Cesars, and other mighty conquerors, but the prospect of obtaining dominion over their fellow-creatures, and having their liberty and property at their dispose? What moved antient Pharaoh to pursue, with his numerous hosts, the children of Israel, with such intrepid zeal, but the prospects of
<PB N="10" REF="021401_0008_0FB3847BCD4A9680"/>
making them his servants for ever? And what has actuated so many of our brethren, in a Christian land, to counteract their own profession of liberty, to brave the dangers of the sea, and hazard their lives among the African tribes, but a thirst after riches, obtained at the expense of the liberty and property of their fellow-creatures? And how ready were we to take the alarm, when our British rulers called for some of our interest? They touched then the apple of our eye—and the universal cry was, "Liberty and property are invaded; the king and parliament are unjust in government; they must be resisted even unto blood:" And by the blessing of Heaven, we maintained our liberties, and some part of our properties, though at the expense of much treasure, at the hazard of a long and sore war, and the loss of many thousand lives. Yet our liberties and property were a treasure so rich, that we thought the conquest great, and the victory glorious. This treasure we commit to the care of our civil rulers; we hold our property under the civil power; we enjoy our liberty from their friendly aid and assist∣ance. Let this establishment be removed, and we have nothing that we can call our own. Our liber∣ty and property would lie at the mercy of those, who have no bounds to their lusts and avarice.—Therefore, rulers who are appointed to defend these, ought to be just; for there is nothing that endan∣gers them, but injustice: but when rulers are un∣just, the interest and liberty of the people become an easy prey to them, and the yoke of bondage is laid on by those hands which are appointed to keep it off. As when an honest traveller, having fifty
<PB N="11" REF="021401_0009_0FB3847D4EE67400"/>
pounds in cash for his support, and fearing lest he fall into the hands of wicked men, who will rob him of his treasure, commits it to the care of his landlord, to keep safe; who takes the advantage of this betrustment, and keeps the whole, and leaves the traveller to earn his passage by constant labour: thus, when the wicked rule, the righteous mourn; but the just ruler will save the needy, and break in pieces the oppressor.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is required of civil rulers, that they be just, as they are raised up and appointed by God, to be the ministers of his kingdom for good to the people, and to act in concert with the divine go∣vernment, and be co-workers with God. The Di∣vine Being never invested any of his ministers with power to act in opposition to his just and righteous laws, but agreeably thereto: and therefore, not only the safety of the people, but the honor of God, requires, that those who rule, be just men. So far as we can discover, through the medium of di∣vine revelation, the administrations of government in the other world, it is perfectly just; God renders to every one according to his just deserts: but the civil ruler is not to pattern after the examples of government in that world; but after Christ, who is our pattern in all things, who never inflicts pun∣ishment upon any of his creatures in this world above what they deserve, but often far less than what they deserve. Rulers may lay that measure of punishment upon offenders, which will secure the honour of government, and the good of the people, and yet display their lenity and goodness, in making it much less than their crimes deserve. This is con∣sistent
<PB N="12" REF="021401_0010_0FB3847ECE98ADD8"/>
with public justice, and agreeable to the ex∣ample of our Saviour, <HI>who does good to the evil and unthankful, and sendeth rain upon the unjust as well as the just.</HI> It is conceded by all, that ministers of the gospel must be just, and exemplary, both in a public &amp; private capacity: it is equally required of civil ru∣lers, that they be just, both in their public and private capacity. Since they are both appointed by God, as his ministers for good to the people, they are both called to labour in the same field, to carry on the same important cause, to support truth and righteousness; though they are called to minister in two different ways, yet they are to carry on the same work. Every thing that the civil power is called to do, is with a direct view to build up the kingdom of Christ, and to advance his cause and interest in the world. Any thing more or less is not required by him, who is given to be head over all things to his church. Therefore, those who rule, must be just.</P>
<P>III. I come now, in the next place, to show, why those who rule, should rule in the fear of God.</P>
<P>And the first reason, which comes under conside∣ration, is, that they are accountable to God for all they do.</P>
<P>As they are dependent upon God for every degree of that power and authority, with which they are invested, and for all those abilities and advantages, with which they are favoured; so they are account∣able to God for the improvement of them: and if they are just &amp; faithful in their station, their rewards will be proportionably great. Their reward will be great in this world, their characters will shine as
<PB N="13" REF="021401_0011_0FB384804D44D9C0"/>
lights on the earth, they will have the best wishes and fervent prayers of the just and wise, and the testimony of every man's conscience in their favour. Above all, they will have inward peace, arising from a consideration of their being just &amp; faithful, which will give them most sensible joy, upon every turn of serious thought and inquiry, which will remove the fearful glooms of decripped age, brighten the dark prospects of death and the grave, and open to their view an inexhaustible treasure of good in the world beyond, where they shall rest from their la∣bours, and their works shall follow them; where they shall receive their full reward, even life ever∣lasting.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another weighty reason may arise from the fearful state of those, who do not rule in the fear of God. These are also accountable, and must receive a just recompence of reward. Their titles, pompous names, and dignified stations, among men, will be no defence for them in the fight of God; <HI>"for he bringeth princes to nothing, and maketh the judges of the earth as vanity;"</HI> Isa. xl. 23. Proud Pharaoh, with all his chariots and horses, finds no more relief from the raging waves, than the meanest of his sub∣jects. Belshazzar, that mighty prince of Babylon, when he saw the handwriting upon the wall, was filled with sore surprize; the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.—Wicked rulers are not only exposed to the judg∣ments of God here, but to a more fearful doom hereafter: for, <HI>when the Heavens depart as a scroll, when it is rolled together, and every mountain &amp; island moved out of their places; then the kings of the earth,
<PB N="14" REF="021401_0012_0FB38481CD64F480"/>
and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, will hide themselves in the dens, and in the rocks of the mountains; and will say to the rocks and mountains, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of Him that sitting on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb; for the great day of his wrath is come, and who shall be able to stand.</HI> Rev. vi. 14, 15, 16, 17.</P>
<P>Reason 3. God will be glorified hereby. If ru∣lers rule in the fear of God, it will give a visible display of God's glory.—The sun which rules the day, the moon and stars which rule the night, dis∣play God's glory in the natural world. Rulers are like suns and stars, in the moral world; and when they rule in the fear of God, divine grace and glory appear in them, as it did in Moses, when he had been with God in the mount, or in our Saviour, on mount Tabor, when his face did shine as the light.</P>
<P>Reason 4. Great good will not only arise to them, but to their subjects, and perhaps to generations yet unborn, if they rule in the fear of God. In ancient times, holy kings and just rulers were a great blessing to the people: things went well with the nation for their sakes; their holy example, and pious walk with God, were a continual testimony of the truth and reality of religion, and had an excellent tendency to preserve the morals, and guide the minds of those who were young and tender. Time would fail me to tell of <HI>Moses, Joshua, David, Josiah</HI> and <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> those just men, who ruled in the fear of God; what blessings they received, what deliverances were wrought for them and their people. Time would also fail, to speak of <HI>Saul, Reoboam, Jeroboam, Ahab,
<PB N="15" REF="021401_0013_0FB3848473FBADA0"/>
Herod,</HI> and many other wicked rulers, and relate what judgments fell upon them and their people, for their unholy examples and wicked practices. Nothing but eternity can unfold to the view of an∣gels and men, the happiness of the one, and the miseries of the other.</P>
<P>But it is now time to close this subject with some improvement.</P>
<P>And 1. We learn from whence rulers have their appointment; it is from God. Though they are said to be chosen of men, yet they are ordained of God. This consideration gives great weight to their office. It is a small thing to be chosen by men; but to be appointed by God, gives such honor and dignity to their appointment, that satan himself durst not bring against them a railing accusation. How careful should rulers then be to obey and glorify God, who has thus honored and dignified them?</P>
<P N="2">2. We learn from what has been said, how great the work and business of rulers is. They are to stand as pillars to support truth, which would other∣wise fall in the st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s; and to stop those innumera∣ble streams of wickedness which would otherwise overspread the land, and bring on a deluge far more dreadful than that which destroyed the old world. They are the shields of the earth, which belong unto God. Though weak in themselves, yet in God they are mighty: he is their refuge and strength, a very present help in a time of trouble. Therefore they need not fear; he breaketh the bow, and cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣eth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariots in the fire; the Lord of hosts is with them, the God of Jacob is their refuge; Psal. xl. 1, 9, 11.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="021401_0014_0FB384858D99E730"/>
Their work is great, as the liberty and property of thousands are committed to their care; in conse∣quence of which, they are reputed as fathers of the people. It is a great charge to stand in the relation of a father to a small family; how much more to stand in that relation to a whole nation? How un∣natural for a father to sacrifice the interest and liberty of his children, and bring them into bond∣age? How much more for rulers to sacrifice the interest and liberties of their subjects, and bring into bondage and distress that people, who confided in them, as their fathers, to defend and protect their rights? Rulers need be very careful: a little in∣justice, which does not seem to affect the community now, may be as a leaven, which may break forth hereafter, and bring distress on many.</P>
<P N="3">3. We learn how much the good of generations to come depends upon the wise administrations, and pious examples, of civil rulers, who lay the foun∣dation for future peace and glory. If our rulers, at this day, like <HI>David,</HI> should lay the foundations of this rising empire, in the wisdom and fear of God, we might expect the building would become exceed∣ing magnificial of fame and of glory throughout all countries. Schools and colleges established up∣on the best footing, enriched with every advantage possible, adorned with the best masters, and most able professors; and churches supplied with faithful ministers, government with just rulers, and the field with excellent officers, would not only strengthen the cords of government, and make strong the bonds of union; but adorn the empire with such inconceivable glory and beauty, as to become the
<PB N="17" REF="021401_0015_0FB38488696A43B0"/>
envy of nations, the wonder of angels, and the tem∣ple of God.</P>
<P N="4">4. We learn the duty of subjects to their rulers, to treat them with all that respect and reverence, which their station requires, to encourage their hearts, and strengthen their hands, by paying due regard to their just and righteous laws. As we are favored with the privilege of choosing our rulers, we should highly prize the privilege, and always be ready to give in our voice agreeably to the advice which <HI>Jethro</HI> gave to Moses:—<HI>Choose ye out of all the people, able men, such as fear God; men of truth, hating covetousness</HI>—And after we have thus chosen our ru∣lers, we should receive the exhortation of the apostle, <HI>That first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men, for kings, and for all that are in authority,</HI> and then we may hope to <HI>lead peaceable and quiet lives, in all godliness and honesty.</HI></P>
<P>I shall now close with a brief address to the vari∣ous characters which compose this assembly: and I shall first speak to his Excellency the Governor.</P>
<P>HONORED SIR, Permit me to address you with that respect and reverence which is due to one in your exalted station. You have been raised up by the providence of God to preside over the people of this state.—This day completes the round of several years, in which you have filled the chief seat in the civil department. Many anxious cares, perplexing thoughts, and gloomy scenes, have doubtless marked your various steps; while reviving hopes, and gladning rays, have inspired your breast with the most pleasing prospects, which have been like pillars to support you; and
<PB N="18" REF="021401_0016_0FB384894D47CBA8"/>
ever will be a source of unspeakable joy and peace, if you are just and rule in the fear of God. Great, yea, very great, is the trust which the people have committed to your charge! and very important are the labours which Heaven calls you to perform. On your wise and pious counsels, just and prudent measures, depends, in some degree, the weal and tranquility of the people through this state. If you are wise and faithful, if you are just and righteous, generations to come will rise up and call you blessed. The course of your administration will so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> be over; your sun has now passed the zenith, and descended far towards the western hills: methinks I see your venerable head now clothed in grey: <HI>the almond tree be∣gins to flourish, and those which look out of the windows grow dim, and the strong men begin to bow themselves.</HI> You may say to the surrounding multitude, as an ancient ruler in Israel once said, I am this day going the way of all the earth; and it must give you un∣speakable joy to see this infant state, which took its rise under your patronage, advancing from the dark shades of obscurity, into the fields of light and liberty.</P>
<P>Honored sir, we wish you all the blessings that time can bestow! and when you are called to resign all by the bold demands of death, we wish a con∣voy of angels to conduct you to higher courts, where you may hear the voice of your enthroned Redeemer, saying, Come thou blessed of my Father, thou hast been faithful in a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things; enter thou into the joy of my Lord!</P>
<P>In the next place I would address myself to his Honor the Deputy-Governor, the Council, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll the Members of this Court.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="021401_0017_0FB3848ACD3535D8"/>
MUCH RESPECTED SIRS, The power and authority which you have over this people, render you worthy of their highest esteem and regard; since to you is committed the care of that political ship, in which our property, liberty, lives and earthly all are embarked. If you are just and faithful, if you rule in the fear of God, we shall ride safe through all the winds and storms which the kingdoms of this world can raise. Yea, the powers of hell cannot prevail against us, for then the Lord Jehovah will be on our side. But if you are unjust, the ship may overset, and the whole car∣go be lost: the people may fall a sacrifice to the rage and violence of those men whose tender mercies are cruel. However, we hope better things; we look up to you as the guardians and protectors of our rights and privileges, which we have maintained at the expense of a long war, in which we have shed much blood, lost many lives, and expended vast sums of treasure; which we consider as small, com∣pared to those liberties which we now enjoy, and which we commit to your care, as to the care of wise and faithful men. This state is now beginning; the foundations of it are now laying; the wheels of government now begin to roll: and how much de∣pends upon what is done in this early period, the good or evil effects of which will extend to genera∣tions to come? The glory and felicity of this state in future time, depends upon your wise and prudent measures. You may now provide for the support of schools; you may do much for the sup∣port of the gospel, and for the good of the church; you are set up for lights in the world, that you may
<PB N="20" REF="021401_0018_0FB3848C4D723320"/>
be eyes to the blind, feet to the lame; and that the blessing of those who are ready to perish, may de∣scend and rest upon you. We look up to you as our leaders; if you are just, and walk in the fear of God, and we do not follow you, our guilt will be upon our own heads, and you will deliver your own souls;—but, if your examples are unholy, and we follow you, our blood will be required at your hands. Christ pronounces the wo upon you; wo unto you Scribes and Pharisees, for ye shut up the kingdom of Heaven against men; for ye neither go in your∣selves, nor suffer them that are entering to go in; Mat. xxiii. 13. As examples in rulers have a sur∣prizing influence upon subjects, we wish to see you ready to every good word and work! And whatso∣ever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, if there be any praise, think on these things; Phil. iv. 8. And may Christ, who will erelong call you to give an account of your stewardship, say unto you, Well done good and faithful servants, because you have been faithful in a few things, I will make you rulers over many things, enter ye into the joy of your Lord.</P>
<P>The ministers of the gospel deserve our notice upon this occasion, and to whom I would now pay my respects.</P>
<P>Reverend Sirs, Permit me, as one of your brethren and compan∣ions in the kingdom and patience of our Lord, to address you in the sacred character of Ambassadors for Jesus Christ. We are called to preach the ever∣lasting

gospel of our divine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the joyful news of pardon and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the atoning merits of his blood. The field <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> entered into is extended far and wide;—the harvest before us is great, and the labourers are few: therefore it is required of us, that we be found faithful, and attend to the duties of our station, as those who must give an account. Though we are not called to take any active part in the civil de∣partment, yet we are to help them by our prayers and preaching; and while they use the weapons of their warfare, and draw the sword of civil justice against open offenders, we are to use the weapons of our warfare, and proclaim the terrors of the Lord against the guilty sinner. Let us never grow faint nor weary in well doing, but be faithful until the death. The employment we have engaged in is noble and important: the rewards of those who are faithful, are great and glorious; and the master whom we serve, is no less than the King of kings, and Lord of lords, who will at last bring forth the many which sleep in the dust; and they that are wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and those who have turned many to righteousness, as the stars forever and ever.</P>
<P>I will now close this discourse with a word of ex∣hortation to this whole assembly.</P>
<P>Permit me to remind you of the bonds of grati∣tude we are under to God, for the smiles of his pro∣vidence, which are this day upon us. We are not assembled in arms, to oppose an invading foe. Our ears are not assailed with the alarms of war, nor our hearts struck with fear and surprize at the sounding

of trumpets and roaring of cannon. Our eyes do not see the garments of our brethren rolled in blood, nor their bodies wounded and torn with the cruel weapons of death; but we see our land in peace, and hear the voice of joy and gladness. We are called to choose our rulers, to make our laws, and govern ourselves, according to our wish and desire. O how different the scene, and how much happier are our prospects, than they were a few years ago, when we were involved in all the horrors of war. This place was then the seat of distress and confusion! How often did we hear the alarms of war, and bend our course with hasty speed to this and other places, to defend our houses and families, and all that was dear unto us, from the sword of our enemies, and from those savages whose tender mercies are cruel!</P>
<P>How long did the important cause lie in suspense, when we stood as fair to lose our all, as to win the day? But Heaven gave the decision in our favour: our enemies were brought to shame and confusion. Princes wandered in the wilderness unpitied &amp; for∣lorn, and their hands were not able to perform their enterprize.</P>
<P>The Captain of our salvation bowed the Heavens and come down; darkness was under his feet; he rode upon a cherub and did fly; yea he did fly up∣on the wings of the wind; he brought salvation to us in a very acceptable time▪ and now we dwell in our houses, and there is none to make us afraid: we assemble for the purpose of establishing govern∣ment, supporting peace, order, &amp; harmony, among us.</P>

Such late and wonderful deliverances, which we have been made to experience, should lead our minds, when we are thus assembled, to that great and solemn day, when the universe shall be assem∣bled before the Judge of all worlds; when the just ruler, the faithful subject, the wise parent, the du∣tiful child, and every pious Christian, shall obtain a complete victory over all their enemies; and as∣cend with a glorious triumph to their everlasting abodes in the New Jerusalem; be crowned with immortal honours, and reign as kings and priests unto God and his Father forever. Then shall these happy ones behold this world, which has been the seat of confusion and discord, in her last convulsions; the rocks rending, the mountains &amp; hills departing, the earth opening to her deep foundations, and con∣tinents and oceans mingling together into their an∣tient chaotic state;—while pillars of smoke, &amp; peals of thunder, and streams of lightning, fill the teem∣ing air, and cause the elements to melt with fervent hear. Then hell will enlarge herself, and open her mouth without measure; and wicked kings, and unjust rulers, with all their pomp and glory, shall descend into it. Let this assembly remember, that this day is approaching, and not forget those solemn and eternal realities, while we are attending to the affairs of this world: but let those who are sub∣jects, obey their rulers in the Lord, for this is right; and those who rule, let them be just, ruling in the fear of the Lord. Amen.</P>
