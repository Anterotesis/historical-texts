<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IT is justly expected of every physician, that at least, he will enquire into the virtues of such substances, as shall offer themselves to his obser∣vation, supposed to possess active medicinal qual∣ities: for "The Lord hath created medicines out of the earth; and he that is wise will not abhor them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> xxxviii. 4.</NOTE>". And as there still remain diseases, which dare raise up their reproachful heads, in obstinate defiance of our art, it is more especially our duty to search out weapons for their destruction: for it is not consistent with our ideas of the goodness of the Deity, to suppose that he would have permitted the favourites of his creation to be inflicted with diseases, without having formed remedies for their relief: but for these, as for relief from spiritual evils—<HI>we must seek, and we shall find;</HI> and as in the latter case, we are directed to the almighty "Father of spirits;" so in the former we should apply to the supplier of all corporeal wants—our all bountiful mother earth, out of whose bosom, as above ob∣served, "The Lord hath created medicines."</P>
<P>AMERICAN physicians, in particular, from their being situated in a country, with respect to me∣dical researches, almost unexplored, must consider it doubly incumbent on them, to attend to its productions; for besides the ipecacuanha, the nake-root, the jalap, and many other useful re∣medies;
<PB N="vi" REF="026149_0004_0FCF55D8E9FE03E8"/>
America has also already furnished a bark, that has removed the fatality of that disease, which in less than forty years deprived Britain of two of its monarchs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The intermittent fever, which is now considered as an innocent complaint, was arranged in the class of incurable dis∣eases, till the discovery of the Peruvian bark: James the 1st, and Oliver Cromwell, both died of this complaint.</NOTE>: and "Who knows but what at the foot of the Allegany mountain there blooms a flower, that is an infallible cure for the epilepsy? Perhaps on the Monongahela, or the Potowmack, there may grow a root, that shall supply, by its tonic power, the invigorating ef∣fects of the savage or military life, in the cure of consumptions<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dr. Rush's concluding lecture.</NOTE>:" and why may there not spring up a water, in some neglected valley, whose solvent quality, may melt down the torturing stone, or whose penetrating influence may root out the scro∣phula from the system?</P>
<P>WHAT funds of useful knowledge may there still be reserved for the discovery of Americans: since it was for them to check the fatal career of the cynanche maligna<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The late Dr. Ogden, of Jamaica, Long-Island, was the person who first introduced the use of Calomel, in this com∣plaint; before which, its fatality among children, was un∣paralleled, by any disease to which they are liable.</NOTE>, and also to loosen the fixed jaw, and relax the rigid muscles of a teta∣nus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We are indebted to Dr. Rush, for erasing this from the list of incurable diseases.</NOTE>?
<PB N="vii" REF="026149_0005_0FCF55DA4197A760"/>
Why may we not hope, that some other of our countrymen, may be fortunate enough, still farther to diminish the list of those diseases, which yet continue to elude the power of medi∣cine?</P>
<P>THESE reflections prevailed upon me, notwith∣standing a surrounding cloud of difficulties<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The most able professions in Europe, say, that <Q>The analysis of mineral waters, is justly considered, one of the most difficult problems in chemistry.</Q></NOTE>, to at∣tempt to ascertain the composition of the mineral wa∣ters of Saratoga—whether I have fully succeeded or not, my experiments, (which I have inserted at full length, for that purpose,) with the skilful chemist will determine; In the mean time, not doubting but that his knowledge of the intricacy of the sub∣ject will furnish him with a cover for the little in∣accuracies he may detect, particularly when he considers, that in this work, I have acted in the dangerous and toilsome capacity of a pioneer, I have opened a way to the analysis of these waters, whereby others may follow on, probably with more success, at least with less difficulty<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">No one has heretofore attempted to analyse these waters, all that has been done, was merely skimming their surface; just an enquiry into the nature of the air discharged from them; see Dr. Mitchell's experiments, related in the Ameri∣can Museum, Vol. IV. I am the first who has ventured to search into their real substance, to ascertain the ingredients of their composition.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="026149_0006_0FCF55DBEB498718"/>
IT has been my intention to render this treatise as generally useful as possible; I have, therefore, not only forborn the use of the new and accurate nomenclature of the French chemists; but have also, in other respects, employed as familiar terms as the nature of the subject would admit of; and as in compositions of this kind, beauty of stile is less aimed at, than perspicuity of expression—I doubt not but that the reader will excuse me, if he finds some sentences which might have been expressed in more elegant language.</P>
<P>WHETHER water of itself considered, is a sim∣ple elementary substance, according to the opinion of the ancients, or a compound, as asserted by many of the moderns, though, perhaps, well de∣serving of attention, is not the business of this dissertation to determine? Its views being confin∣ed, merely to discover the nature of such mineral substances, as are often dissolved in it, and to which many waters owe their particular medici∣nal virtues.</P>
<P>SUCH mineral waters have been noticed as far back as the time of <HI>Hyppocrates. Pliny</HI> mentions certain of them, as possessing medicinal proper∣ties; but we do not find any account of a method to detect their composition, till about the middle of the seventeenth century, when <HI>Boyle</HI> first ob∣served, that the infusion of vegetable blues, was an accurate test for discovering the presence of un∣combined acids or alkalies, by becoming red with
<PB N="ix" REF="026149_0007_0FCF55DD66071B80"/>
the former, and green with the latter. He after∣wards found out many other substances, for the more full examination of waters.</P>
<P>DURING the time that <HI>Boyle</HI> was employed in these researches, <HI>Duclos</HI> was busy in the analysis of the waters of France, and made several improve∣ments, by the addition of galls, and the tincture of turnsol, to our stock of regents. <HI>Hierne, Val∣lerius, Boulduc</HI> and many other celebrated che∣mists, continued to render this branch of science more perfect.</P>
<P>IN the beginning of the present century, <HI>Hoff∣man,</HI> followed by <HI>Springsfield</HI> and <HI>Venel,</HI> paid par∣ticular attention to what they called the mineral spirit of waters, and which since, by <HI>Dr. Priestly,</HI> has been proved to be the aerial or cretacious acid.</P>
<P>THE mode of analising waters have been con∣tinually improving, since the first experiments of <HI>Boyle</HI>—till at length the celebrated <HI>Bergman</HI> has given the finishing stroke of its present perfection.</P>
<P>IN examining these waters. I have proceeded first by <HI>reagents,</HI> to ascertain the different ingre∣dients in their composition: for notwithstanding a late author<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> considers these as mere amusing experiments, yet I rather suppose them very use∣ful means, nor that purpose, particularly when ap∣plied in the extensive manner that I have done; and I fancy every reader will be of my opinion,
<PB N="x" REF="026149_0008_0FCF55DEC425AD10"/>
upon a candid perusal of this dissertation: I ac∣knowledge we are thereby only enabled to disco∣ver the different ingredients of mineral waters—but not the proportion of each. I was, therefore, obliged to apply to <HI>distillation,</HI> to obtain the pro∣portion of their aerial, and to <HI>evaporation</HI> and <HI>chrystalization</HI>—that of their fixed principles.</P>

<HEAD>A DISSERTATION ON THE MINERAL WATERS OF SARATOGA, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>A topographical description of the country, and situ∣ation of the several springs.</HEAD>
<P>THESE springs are situated on the westerly side of a valley, which lies about twelve miles west of the conflux of Fish-Creek, with the North River<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Which is about two hundred miles above the city of New-York.</NOTE>, in the country of Saratoga, and state of New-York. This valley, at least the part of it where the springs rise, runs a northerly and southerly course, and appears to have been form∣ed by a branch of the Kayadoroseres river; which flows through the middle of it. The high ground that forms the westerly bank of the valley, and which appears to supply the waters of these springs, which are situated at its foot, is composed, almost entirely, of calcarious rocks,
<PB N="12" REF="026149_0010_0FCF4CB05E1687A8"/>
whose surface, however, is mostly overspread with a sand and clayey soil, and covered with tall pines and oaks: there are several deep subterra∣neous caverns observed in it, which open but a small distance from where the declivity commenc∣es. The bank on the easterly side appears almost entirely sand, with not the least vestige of calca∣rious earth, and is a perfect pine plane.</P>
<P>THE cause of this sudden change of soil, which however, is not peculiar to this place alone<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As Hempstead plains on Long Island and its contiguous soil is a remarkable instance.</NOTE>, and also of the river's making its way, at this particu∣lar juncture—I leave to the speculation of the na∣turalist to determine, a mere knowledge of their existence and situation being all that is necessary, either as to their affording us an assistant means for ascertaining the nature of the mineral waters, in their neighbourhood, or as enabling us to ac∣count for the presence of ingredients we may find in them. About four miles west of these springs, I am informed there is a strong scented sulphuri∣ous spring.</P>
<P>THE springs are eight or ten in number, and all are within the space of about half a mile; the one which has particularly attracted the atten∣tion of the curious, and which is mostly drank by valetudinarians, rises about midway between the others; it is entirely surrounded by a rock of a conical shape, which is about five sect high,
<PB N="13" REF="026149_0011_0FCF55E1C0F83310"/>
and whose base is about nine feet in diameter; it has a circular hole, in its apex, of near ten inches across, which is the opening of its inner cavity in which the water rises to within about two feet of its top. This cavity, like the outside of the rock, enlarges, as it descends. The surface of this rock is of a brownish colour, and appears compact and polished, it has a check in one side of it, which is supposed to descend internally and form some vent below the surface of the ground, by which the water makes its way out, as it has not been known to overflow for several years past. The crack is believed to have been pro∣duced by the fall of a tree over the spring; and the remains of the upper part of one which lies in the marsh below, and whose body is directly immediately towards it, renders this opinion ve∣ry probable, since its size and situation prove that it must have stood on the opposite side of the rock; indeed I am informed, by a man of that country, that he very well recollects when the tree stood there, and that then the water overflowed the rock: another person informed me, that he knew it to overflow in the time of the late war.</P>
<P>THESE waters naturally deposit a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> matter where they flow; thereby forming to themselves, a barrier of defence against the intru∣sion of heterogeneous substances: the reason why the <HI>rock spring</HI> (as the one just described is called) in particular has surrounded itself by such a regu∣lar
<PB N="14" REF="026149_0012_0FCF4CB4B7851E98"/>
formed pyramidial mass—I take to be owing to its natural situation rendering it more inacces∣sible to the animals, that may have resorted here for the waters, (which they appear to be very fond of, as well as of licking substances about the springs, on account of their saline impregnation,) whence is has, perhaps, during the course of ages, been permitted, unmolestedly, to precipitate par∣ticles upon particles of its stony matter, till final∣ly, it has attained its present appearance, while a spring, a small distance from it, which, (from its supplying the waters that are continually convey∣ed from it, by a little wooden gutter, fixed for that purpose, into the bathing tub; which is situ∣ated in a log inclosure, just below it in the marsh) is called the <HI>bathing spring;</HI> which, notwithstand∣ing it has afforded a much greater quantity of this petrefactive deposition, so as to form an irregular rock, of about twenty one feet in diameter, around itself, by being more easily come at, has had its tender layers trodden down continually, as they formed, before they could assume any regular shape.</P>
<P>THE <HI>stony matter</HI> of these springs, by calcina∣tion, forms <HI>quicklime.</HI></P>
<P>A PIECE of it, put into <HI>vitriolic acid,</HI> caused a great effervescence, and formed a <HI>selenites,</HI> or <HI>plaster of Paris,</HI> and also a small portion of <HI>allum,</HI> proved, by the solutions depositing a cloudy <HI>sedi∣ment,</HI> by passing <HI>volatile alkaline gas</HI> through it;
<PB N="15" REF="026149_0013_0FCF55E3B918B300"/>
and also <HI>martial</HI> vitriol, whence it assumed a beau∣tiful <HI>blue</HI> colour, by the addition of <HI>lime water sa∣turated with Prusian blue:</HI> hence the petrefactions must be composed of an <HI>argillo calcarious earth</HI> and <HI>iron;</HI> to this last is owing the redish colour, with which great part of it is tinged.</P>
<P>HAVING settled these preliminaries; I proceed more particularly to enquire into</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>THE NATURE OF THE WATERS.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD TYPE="sub">First. Of their physical properties.</HEAD>
<P>I. THESE waters, in general, appear <HI>nearly</HI> transparent, yet none of them are perfectly so, excepting that which rises up in a barrel, which the neighbours have fixed for the purpose of col∣lecting it, and is called the <HI>barrel spring;</HI> they are <HI>colourless,</HI> and emit a great quantity of <HI>air</HI> by agitation, even by standing still in an open ves∣sel, it almost immediately forms bubbles around its inside, which soon rise up and are discharged. The vessel used to dip the water out of the rock, and also the bathing tub, soon gather an <HI>ochery crust</HI> upon their inner surfaces. Where∣ever these waters stagnate, around the springs, besides depositing the stony matter before menti∣oned, they also soon become covered with a <HI>pellicle</HI> of a metallic splendour, reflecting variegated colours.</P>
<P>II. THEY diffuse a <HI>subtle penetrating odour,</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="026149_0014_0FCF55E4CA6E6130"/>
which is most particularly experienced by breath∣ing in the orifice of the rock.</P>
<P>III. WHEN drank, their first impression on the palate, is agreeably <HI>acescent,</HI> succeed by a nause∣ous saline taste; they afterwards give up acescent eructations, like fermented liquors, and which are no ways unpleasant.</P>
<P>IV. THE hydrometer stands at the same height in these, as in snow water.</P>
<P>V. NOTWITHSTANDING the discharge of air from these waters, makes them appear to be in a continued ebulition, yet they are cold, the tem∣perature, however, is not the same in all the springs; but seems to diminish in proportion to their briskness, thus the bathing spring and the barrel, each of which discharges about twenty gallons in an hour, which is much more than the rest do, lowered Fatherinheits thermometre from 72°, the heat of the atmosphere, to 52°, while in the others it stood at 56° and 58°, but in the rock water, which runs very slowly, it remained at 67°.</P>
<P>VI. BY the application of a gentle heat, these waters discharge a great quantity of <HI>air</HI> in bub∣bles; it is upon this property, that their use in raising bread depends, and for which purpose they are carried away in considerable quantities, daily, even sometimes to eight or ten miles distance; all that is necessary being merely to make the dough, with flour and this water alone, and it is imme∣diately ready to put in the oven.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="section">
<PB N="17" REF="026149_0015_0FCF55E64863FAD0"/>
<HEAD>II. EXPERIMENTS UPON THE AIR.</HEAD>
<P>I. A <HI>lighted candle</HI> let down in the crater of the rock, was immediately <HI>extinguished,</HI> both blaze and wick, before it came within a foot of the surface of the water: the air obtained by agi∣tating the water of this, as well as of the other springs, was equally incapable of supporting com∣bustion, as was also that collected from the bub∣bles, that were continually discharging from the different springs.</P>
<P>II. A <HI>chicken</HI> being immersed in this air, <HI>expired</HI> in three minutes. A <HI>kitten</HI> confined in it for one and a half minutes, appeared very flaccid and al∣most dead; yet, on being brought out, into free atmospheric air, its fleeting life was soon recalled through the medium of violent convulsions; be∣ing again put into the noxious gas, in fourteen minutes it was irrecoverably <HI>dead.</HI></P>
<P>III. THE air being made to pass through <HI>lime-water</HI> immediately rendered it very <HI>turbid.</HI></P>
<P>IV. IT rendered a diluted <HI>tincture of turnsol</HI> of <HI>a red</HI> tinge, by passing through it.</P>
<P>FROM the physical qualities mentioned, and from the above experiments, we may safely con∣clude, that this air is the true <HI>spiritus mineralis</HI> of Hoffman, the <HI>carbonic acid gas</HI> of the French che∣mists, the <HI>aerial acid</HI> of Bergman, the fixed air of Priestly and Black, the <HI>cretacious acid</HI> of Four∣croy,
<PB N="18" REF="026149_0016_0FCF55E7C9493280"/>
and what is generally known with the mi∣ners, by the name of <HI>choak damp;</HI> it is similar to the noxious gas, which rises up to the height of several inches, in the famous <HI>grotto del cani</HI> in Italy; this cave having received its name from its fatality to dogs: they, from carrying their heads below the surface of this stratum of air, be∣ing the animals which are generally submitted to experiment, to satisfy travellers of its delete∣rious effects. It is this air which is so plentifully given out, during the spirituous fermentation, and is what gives that briskness to porter, and other malt liquors. Being united with the vegetable alkali, it forms our common potash—hence the reason why our good housewives are enabled, any time, at half an hour's warning, to furnish us with a well raised cake, merely by mixing up the flour with a solution of potash and sour milk; here the acid of the milk, from a greater attrac∣tion, joins itself to the alkali, while the aeriform acid being set at liberty, and assisted by the expansive power of heat, penetrates and puffs up every particle of the dough. It is this air also, which constitutes the difference between quick∣lime and chalk or limestone, its discharge is the effect of their calcination.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="section">
<PB N="19" REF="026149_0017_0FCF4CB8D4774DB8"/>
<HEAD>III. THE EFFECTS OF REAGENTS UP∣ON THE WATERS.</HEAD>
<P>I. THE <HI>rock water</HI> had a little of the <HI>tincture of turnsol</HI> dropped into it, which immediately gave it a <HI>reddish</HI> tinge.</P>
<P>II. The infusion of our common blue lark∣spur<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The infusion of blue lark-spur, I have found to be a most accurate test for discovering the presence of the smallest quantity, of either uncombined alkalies, or fixed acids.</NOTE> was not changed by it.</P>
<P>III. IN <HI>lime-water,</HI> it instantly induced a mil∣ky <HI>turbidness,</HI> followed by a <HI>deposition of white powder.</HI></P>
<P>IV. <HI>Tincture of galls</HI> rendered it <HI>purple</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It has been observed, that notwithstanding this water mixes with gin, without discoloration; yet it will not make grog: for immediately upon pouring in the spirits, it becomes blackish. This, though unaccountable to many, is no more than what every chemist would expect, when he considers that from the oak casks in which spirits is kept, it generally be∣comes a true tincture, of a vegetable astringent.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>V. <HI>Prusian lime-water</HI> produced no change in it.</P>
<P>VI. A SOLUTION of pure <HI>vegetable alkali,</HI> pro∣duced a <HI>turbidness</HI> in it.</P>
<P>VII. IT was also made <HI>turbid</HI> by <HI>aerated vegita∣ble alkali.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="026149_0018_0FCF55E9411E4140"/>
VIII. CAUSTIC <HI>volatile alkali,</HI> forms a cloudi∣ness in it; yielding a <HI>white precipitate.</HI></P>
<P>IX. <HI>Vitriolic acid,</HI> dropped into the water, caused a great effervescence, and a little <HI>tur∣bidness.</HI></P>
<P>X. AFTER vitriolic acid had been dropped in the water, it then became <HI>blue</HI> by <HI>Prusian lime-water</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This experiment, which is an original one, shews by what method we may detect aerated iron, by the <HI>Prusian lime-water,</HI> and tends to conform the experiment with tinct. of galle.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>XI. <HI>Nitrated silver</HI> formed an immediate copi∣ous <HI>white curdled precipitate;</HI> this, as also the water itself, soon assumed a <HI>dirty bluish colour.</HI></P>
<P>XII. <HI>Nitrated mercury</HI> produced a copious <HI>yellowish precipitate.</HI></P>
<P>XIII. <HI>Acid of sugar,</HI> occasions a <HI>cloudiness,</HI> which soon falls down in a <HI>white precipitate.</HI></P>
<P>XIV. <HI>Acetated lead,</HI> produced a copious <HI>white,</HI> but not <HI>granutated precipitate.</HI></P>
<P>MOST of these experiments were frequently re∣peated, and with similar results.</P>
<P>THE waters of the <HI>other springs</HI> exhibited the same appearances, with the above reagents, as the rock water, excepting that of the <HI>bathing spring</HI> and of the <HI>barrel's</HI> shewing a <HI>deeper purple</HI> tinge with <HI>tincture of galls.</HI></P>
<P>THE water being <HI>boiled,</HI> discharged a great quantity of <HI>air,</HI> formed a <HI>pellicle</HI> on its surface, and deposited a <HI>white powder.</HI> It afterwards
<PB N="21" REF="026149_0019_0FCF55EB83FD2228"/>
had not that brisk accidulous taste, as before, but was extremely <HI>nauseous;</HI> it was not reddened by <HI>tincture of turnsol,</HI> nor rendered purple <HI>by tinc∣ture of galls;</HI> with infusion of <HI>lark-spur,</HI> it became <HI>green:</HI> it still <HI>precipitated lime-water,</HI> though not so plentifully as before, and also <HI>effervesced</HI> slightly, <HI>with vitriolic acid;</HI> but was not made <HI>turbid</HI> thereby. <HI>Acid of sugar</HI> did not induce a turbidness, its appearance was not altered by the <HI>caustic vegetable</HI> nor <HI>volatile alkalies,</HI> nor by the <HI>aerated vegetable alkali.</HI></P>
<P>FROM these experiments, I conclude, that these waters contain,</P>
<P>I. <HI>An uncombined</HI> ACID, whereby they become red by tincture of turnsol, and that this cannot be a fixed acid, since it does not redden infusion of lark-spur, and is evaporated by boiling; for af∣terwards the water does not change tincture of turnsol; therefore it must be the <HI>cretacious acid,</HI> the same as has been heretofore proved to be con∣tinually discharging from them, in large quanti∣ties: it is from the presence of this, that lime-water becomes so very turbid; for with lime it forms an insoluble compound.</P>
<P>II. IRON.—Hence it takes a purple tinge, with tincture of galls, and also, when previously joined with vitriolic acid, becomes blue, with Prusian lime-water, and that the iron is not kept in solution, by the vitriolic acid, or it would have
<PB N="22" REF="026149_0020_0FCF55ED2656D990"/>
become blue by this test, before the acid was united with it; but by the cretacious acid, since after being boiled, this water is no more discolour∣ed, by tincture of galls.</P>
<P>III. A QUANTITY of LIME <HI>held in solution by the cretacious acid;</HI> for notwitstanding lime, as above observed, is rendered insoluble by uniting with the cretacious acid, yet it is otherwise when su∣persaturated therewith; for then it is, to the con∣trary, much more soluble: hence the cause of a precipitation, by the caustic vegetable, and vola∣tile alkalies. They, from their affinity to the acid, deprive the lime of its superabundance, and per∣mit it to fall down in a white powder. The vi∣triolic acid, on the contrary, attracts the lime, and forms a gypseous deposition, while the cretacious acid flies off in a great effervescence. The acid of sugar, also, evinces the presence of lime, by uniting and forming an insoluble compound with it. These tests did not exhibit the same ap∣pearances with the water, after ebulition: hence the pellicle and deposition formed, during that process, I take to be calcarious earth and iron.</P>
<P>IV. A MURIATIC ACID. Hence with ni∣trated silver it forms a sudden, caseous precipi∣tate, and also a precipitate with nitrated mercury; this last precipitate on being sublimed, afforded corrossive sublimate.</P>
<P>V. A NEUTRAL SALT. Since they have
<PB N="23" REF="026149_0021_0FCF4CC56375F120"/>
been proved by the two last mentioned experi∣ments, to contain a marine acid, and by some of the previous ones, that this cannot exist in a sepe∣rate state; therefore it must be united either with an earth, or an alkali, and as a cretacious alkali will be shewn to be present in the water, it is evi∣dent that it must be joined with the latter; since alkalies have a greater attraction for acids, than earths have.</P>
<P>VI. A CRETACIOUS ALKALI, whereby, after the water has been boiled, it renders the infusion of lark-spur green, and effervesces with vitriolic acid; this may also be the cause why lime-water is still precipitated by it. Here the cretacious acid quits the alkali, to unite with its more at∣tracting lime, forming therewith, as abovemen∣tioned, an insoluble compound. The reason why the water did not change the infusion of lark∣spur, before it had been boiled, must be owing to the alkali's being supersaturated with the creta∣cious acid, in which case, as I proved by an expe∣riment made for that purpose, it may exist in a considerable quantity in a water, without chang∣ing vegetable blues.</P>
<P>VII. A SLIGHT <HI>impregnation of</HI> SULPHUR, thereby darkening the nitrated silver; this is what might reasonably be expected, as within about four miles there is a proper strong scented sulphu∣rious spring.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="026149_0022_0FCF55EF8EAB5730"/>
THE last mentioned experiment, on the waters, previous to ebulition, (see p. 20.) proves, by the precipitate's not appearing granulated, that vitri∣olic acid does not exist in these waters, either in a simple or combined state.</P>
<P>THE presence of an uncombined alkali, (if we may still be permitted to call aerated alkali's so) as proved, by the boiled water's rendering infu∣sion of lark-spur green, clearly proves the non-existence of any earthy or metallic salts in this water; since the alkali, from its superior attrac∣tion to acids, must entirely prevent their forma∣tion.</P>
<P>FROM the above effects of reagents, it appears, that <HI>the waters contain</HI>

<ITEM>Cretacious acid,</ITEM>

and a Sulphurious impregnation.</P>
<P>THE proportion of each of the above ingredi∣ents, and the nature of the base of the neutral, and the species of the cretacious alkali, yet re∣main unknown; I therefore proceeded, by the more tedious processes of distillation, evaporation, and chrystalization, to ascertain these points.</P>

<HEAD>IV. DISTILLATION.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the experiments of Bergman, it appears that water is capable of absorbing about equal its bulk of cretacious acid, at the temperature of 55°, and proportionably less as its temperature is increased. Now, as before observed, the bubbles of this acid, are continually passing through the waters, under examination, it is therefore clear that they must be fully saturated with it, and as their temperature is higher than that at which wa∣ter will retain its equal bulk, we are obliged to conclude, that it does not contain quite so much; but from the following experiment I doubt whe∣ther it lacks much of it.</P>
<P>BY the means of a florence flask, with a syphon properly affixed to it and the application of heat, I collected, from a given quantity of this water, in a glass vessel that had been previously filled with, and inverted in hot water, upwards of its bulk of aerial fluid, the greater part of which I take to be the abovementioned acid; the rest, perhaps, partly atmospheric mephites, and partly vital air. That the water contains this last, is proved, by its depositing an ochery substance, after having some green vitriol dissolved in it, in a well corked viol.</P>

<HEAD>V. EVAPORATION.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER evaporating ten pounds of the water of the rock, in glass vessels, by the heat of a <HI>water bath,</HI> I obtained a brownish coloured residue, which when dried, weighed 6 drachms, 2 scruples, 3 grains; this residum was put into four times its weight of <HI>spirits of wine,</HI> and after standing a considerable time, being frequently agitated; was filtered and dried, and was found to have lost about 17 grs. which proved to be common salt; for by evaporating the spirits, I obtained it in regular <HI>cubic chrystals.</HI> This circumstance of spirits of wine dissolving a portion of marine salt, I take to be owing to its not being so highly rec∣tified, as it ought to be: for when perfectly pure, it will only take up salited lime, and salited mag∣nesia, nitrated lime, and nitrated magnesia, and sa∣lited terra ponderosa; but when some what diluted, it will, beside these salts, also take up others: but, however, as by evaporation I obtained nothing but cubic chrystals, I now conclude, positively, what in fact was before proved by reagents, that there are none of the above mentioned earthy salts in these waters.</P>
<P>I now immersed the residum in 8 oz. of <HI>cold distilled water,</HI> which, after remaining several hours, and being frequently agitated, was filter∣ed; the insoluble residue being dried and weigh∣ed,
<PB N="27" REF="026149_0025_0FCF55F483DE7A80"/>
was found to have lost, 3 drachms, 2 grains; this watery solution, by turning the infusion of larkspur green, is proved to contain an uncom∣bined alkali. Experiments before made, shew that these waters contain the muriatic acid, and as the mutual attraction, between an acid and an alkali, will not permit them to remain in compa∣ny with each other, particularly when surrounded by their conjuctive agent, water: without unit∣ing, therefore, we must again suppose this acid to be in combination, and indeed its not rendering the infusion of larkspur red, decidedly forbids any other conclusion.</P>
<P>THIS solution of a muriatic neutral salt and an alkali, I submitted to the heat of the sun, where∣by, after great part of the water was evaporated, some <HI>cubical chrystals</HI> appeared to form upon its surface, but which were soon disturbed, by <HI>irre∣gular saline concretions.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING ascertained the presence of a <HI>muriatic neutral salt,</HI> and an uncombined <HI>alkali;</HI> but not knowing decidedly, either the species of the al∣kali, or the base of the neutral salt; I therefore made a saturated solution of this mixed salt, and added thereto, <HI>acid of tartar,</HI> and no precipita∣tion taking place, I concluded that no <HI>vegetable alkali</HI> can be present, or it would have fallen down in the form of cremor tartar; therefore, the <HI>aerated alkali</HI> must be of the <HI>mineral</HI> kind,
<PB N="28" REF="026149_0026_0FCF55F66A4C9918"/>
and the base of the <HI>neutral,</HI> must be the same, which, with its acid, forms our common <HI>sea salt.</HI></P>
<P>To find the <HI>proportion</HI> of the marine salt and the alkali, I dissolved the mixed salt in water and added <HI>distilled vinegar</HI> thereto, until I brought it to the exact point of saturation: I then satu∣rated an equal quantity of distilled vinegar, with mineral alkali, for which purpose it required 26 grains, whence it appears, that ten pounds of this mineral water contains 26 grs. of <HI>mineral alkali,</HI> the remainder, 156 grs. must be common <HI>salt,</HI> which added to the 17 grs. dissolved in the spirits of wine, makes ten pounds of the water contain 173 grs.</P>
<P>THE remaining 3 drachms, I scruple, 4 grains, I exposed to the sun, for several weeks, moisten∣ing it frequently with rain water; this was done, in order to rust the iron, so as to make it insolu∣ble in <HI>distilled vinegar;</HI> in which this residue was afterwards digested and filtered. The filtered li∣quor was then evaporated, and what was left, was re-dissolved, in <HI>vitriolic acid,</HI> with which it formed a <HI>gypsum,</HI> but no bitter salt; hence, as there was but about 12 or 14 grs. remaining on the fillet, it appears that ten pounds of this water contains 3 drachms, 10 grs. of <HI>aerated lime</HI>—but no mag∣nesia.</P>
<P>THE substance remaining on the filter, by be∣ing dissolved in vitriolic acid, afforded 8 and 1-2
<PB N="29" REF="026149_0027_0FCF55F783A161E0"/>
grs. of iron, precipitated in form of Prusian blue, by the Prusian lime-water.</P>
<P>IT appears, from a review of these experiments that a quart of this water must contain,
<LIST>
<ITEM>Cretacious acid, about 40 cubic inches,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Mineral alkali, 5.2 grs.</ITEM>

<HEAD>BARKER's SPRINGS.</HEAD>
<P>THE mineral waters that have been already noticed, are not the only one's in the coun∣ty of Saratoga. About three miles below the junction of Fish-Creek with the North River, and about two miles west of the latter, in a hollow belonging to, and immediately back of the dwell∣ing house of, <HI>William Barker,</HI> are several mineral springs, the waters of which, both by their sensi∣ble qualities, and by the operation of reagents, ap∣pear to be very similar to those heretofore men∣tioned. They do not, however, deposit the sto∣ny matter, as the others do, nor do they in other respects, appear to be so strongly impregnated with mineral substances.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="026149_0028_0FCF55F9096B8F60"/>
THEY are situated in a clayey soil, with no ap∣pearance of lime-stone in their neighbourhood. The land is covered with beach and oak trees.</P>
<P>THE <HI>air</HI> which bubbles up in these springs, by the experiments formerly mentioned; appears to be the same <HI>cretacious acid</HI> as is discharged from the other springs, it equally <HI>extinguishes flame,</HI> render <HI>lime water turbid,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE water is also proved to contain the same <HI>air</HI> in its composition, not only by the experi∣ments as made at the other springs; but also by its not being able to support animal life. <HI>A fish</HI> in two and a half minutes <HI>died</HI> in it.</P>
<P>IRON appears to exist in these waters, by their becoming <HI>tinged,</HI> though slightly with <HI>tincture of galls;</HI> and it must be aerated; since this property no longer continues after the water has been boiled.</P>
<P>LIME rendered soluble by a <HI>superabundance of cretacious acid;</HI> was detected in these, by the same means as were used with the other waters.</P>
<P>THEY contain aerated ALKALI, therefore after being boiled they still effervesce with <HI>vitriolic acid.</HI></P>
<P>A MURIATIC ACID is proved to exist in them, by the <HI>nitrated silver,</HI> and <HI>nitrated mercury;</HI> and it must be in combination; thereby forming a <HI>neutral salt,</HI> whose base, though not fully ascer∣tained, is presumed from its taste, and the great si∣milarity there is between these and the other wa∣ters.
<PB N="31" REF="026149_0029_0FCF55FA8860B6E0"/>
to be of the mineral kind; therefore the neutral I believe to be <HI>sea salt.</HI></P>
<P>BESIDES these acescent springs there is also an∣other in the same hollow; about a stones throw distance from them, which is entirely of a differ∣ent nature, and from its smelling like the washings of a gun-barrel, has gained the name of the <HI>gun-powder spring.</HI> The water is <HI>transparent:</HI> its <HI>temperature</HI> 58°; it <HI>smells</HI> and <HI>tastes</HI> like sulphur, or rather liver of sulphur; by boiling it looses both its disagreeable smell and taste.</P>
<P>THE <HI>air</HI> discharged from it by boiling, being made to pass through <HI>lime water;</HI> produced <HI>no turbidness,</HI> hence they contain no free aerial acid.</P>
<P>THIS water is not discoloured either by <HI>tincture of galls</HI> or <HI>Prussian lime water.</HI></P>
<P>WITH <HI>nitrated mercury</HI> it forms a <HI>precipitate.</HI></P>
<P>WITH <HI>nitrated silver</HI> it also forms a precipi∣tate; which as well as the water directly assumes a <HI>dark purpleish brown</HI> colour: this precipitate is suspected to arise from a <HI>marine acid,</HI> and the dark colour from <HI>hepatic</HI> or <HI>sulphurious gas.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Vitriolic acid,</HI> produces an effervescence, this must be owing to the presence of a <HI>cretacious alkali,</HI> it also rendered <HI>lime water turbid;</HI> this must be from the same cause, hence the above∣mentioned muriatic acid must be in combination, in form of a <HI>neutral salt.</HI></P>

<HEAD>OF THE MEDICAL VIRTUES OF THE WA∣TERS OF SARATOGA.</HEAD>
<P>Notwithstanding these waters, when properly applied may be useful in many complaints; yet as is generally the case with medicines that get into practice, and gain a degree of reputation, before their real qualities are known; they are used too indiscriminately for the cure of almost every dis∣ease, even those of a directly opposite nature, thus we find intermittents, pleurisies, dropsies, manias, &amp;c. all equally apply here for help, and what is still more extraordinary, while I was at the springs I saw a person there who had come upwards of three hundred miles, to drink the waters for the cure of a fistula lachrymalis.</P>
<P>THESE waters may be taken in very large quan∣tities into the stomach without producing any un∣easiness or weight, excepting sometimes in deli∣cate stomachs, they cause a sense of coldness and sometimes proves emetic: some persons will drink several quarts within half an hour, without any inconvenience, in which case they generally ope∣rate two or three times by stool, and very copi∣ously by urine; they at the same time frequently produce a gentle diaphoresis; they more particu∣larly act upon these two last excreories, when tak∣en in small doses as from half a pint to a pint, and repeated four or five times in the course of
<PB N="33" REF="026149_0031_0FCF55FDAFFD5EB0"/>
the day; in some persons these waters induce a degree of inebriety similar to wine: they general∣ly increase the appetite.</P>
<P>IT is much to be regretted, that there does not some person properly qualified reside at these springs; who would keep a register of the complaints of those who apply there for relief; and the effects of the waters upon them: the want of this oblig∣es us to establish their virtues, from the known effects of the ingredients of their composition, which are now ascertained; assisted by the inac∣curate accounts of the neighbours.</P>
<P>FROM the great relief that Benjamin Colburn first received by the use of an alkaline water, super∣saturated with cretacious acid, and which afterwards proved equally serviceable to his fellow-sufferers, with <HI>stone and gravely complaints;</HI> and also from the experience of DR. FALCONER in confirming the same<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Falconer's appendix to Dobson's commentary on fix∣ed air.</NOTE>, I have not the least doubt but that these waters may be used with advantage in these complaints; since they are proved to contain a su∣persaturated aerated alkali, and also as they are found to operate very quickly and powerfully on the urinary passages, indeed the neighbours report of its use in such cases, confirms this opinion.</P>
<P>THE cretacious acid is proved by the experi∣ments of DR. DOBSON, to be a powerful stimulant and antisceptic, and in these waters its being conjoin∣ed with a chalybeate; I fully believe according to the accounts of the neighbours, and persons who
<PB N="34" REF="026149_0032_0FCF55FF10BC0AD8"/>
had experienced relief from those complaints, that they may be very serviceable in <HI>chronic rheuma∣tisms, dyspepsia,</HI> and some other long standing com∣plaints of debility: and also in <HI>old phagedenic ulcers</HI> and <HI>scorbutic complaints.</HI></P>
<P>FROM their conjoined effects of purgative anti∣septic and tonic qualities; they appear to be pro∣perly formed for the cure of the <HI>dysentery:</HI> a per∣son at the springs, was using them for this com∣plaint while I was there, he informed me that they formerly cured him of it.</P>
<P><HI>Cutanious Eruptions,</HI> frequently prove very obstinate diseases; therefore are found in great plenty at these springs, and I am happy to add, that they have generally disappeared by the use of the waters: for this purpose they must be used externally, as well as internally. We need not be surprised that these waters are so ve∣ry useful in such complaints, since from their proving gently diaphoretic, and also by the bath∣ings keeping the skin clean and moist, in con∣junction with the sulphurious impregnation, prov∣ed to exist in them; they appear to be extremely well calculated for that purpose<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am told that during the late war, while the troops lay at Saratoga, many of them were affected with the itch and were sent off in companies to these springs; by which they were all cured.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I HAVE never heard of the effects of these wa∣ters in <HI>serophula;</HI> (or kings evil) but as they con∣tain sea-salt, and as they appear from increasing the different excretions to act particularly on the glandular system; and as they also prove a stimu∣lus
<PB N="35" REF="026149_0033_0FCF560086902D00"/>
and tonic to the system at large. I think them well deserving a trial in this disease.</P>
<P>THEIR use in <HI>bypochondriasis</HI> and other <HI>nervous affections,</HI> which are diseases generally arising from the indolence and luxury of a city life; and consequently a considerable distance from the springs, perhaps depend in a great degree upon the amusing scenes, more simple food and constant ex∣ercise, which are unavoidably connected with a long journey; and if any advantage is gained in <HI>consumptions</HI> from their use, I rather suppose it owing to the same circumstances connected there∣with; since fixed air, which seems to be the predom∣inant agent in the operation of these waters, has, by those who have made experiments thereon, gene∣rally been found prejudicial in these complaints, in fact the common report is, that these waters are prejudicial in phthisical complaints.</P>
<P>THESE waters have also been in repute for the cure of <HI>Dropsy,</HI> and from their possessing such a conjoined stimulant, and evacuative quality as al∣ready mentioned; it appears very probable that they may promote the absorption of the fluid in the cavities of the human body; and carry it en∣tirely out of the system.</P>
<P>THERE are likewise very satisfactory accounts of <HI>paralitic</HI> affections, having been cured or at least considerably relieved, by the inward and outward use of these mineral waters.</P>
<P>IT has likewise been related, upon undoubted testimony, that <HI>fevers</HI> and <HI>agues</HI> or <HI>intermittents</HI> have frequently been cured by them.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="026149_0034_0FCF56030258A988"/>
ALL these observations apply particularly to the asidulous springs. The <HI>sulphur water,</HI> I ima∣gine may be more usefully applied in <HI>cutanious eruptions,</HI> particularly the <HI>itch;</HI> however I believe no trials have yet been made with it in any complaint.</P>

<HEAD>A CONJECTURE UPON THE MANNER OF THE NATURAL FORMATION OF THESE WATERS.</HEAD>
<P>THE manner by which these waters become charged with their iron, lime, salt, and alkali, hardly needs an explanation; as all these substan∣ces exist ready formed in the bowels of the earth; and water after being aerated cannot pass over them without taking up a part; but the manner in which it gains this aerial impregnation, as the cretacious acid does not naturally exist in an un∣combined state in the earth; is not so easily ac∣counted for.</P>
<P>THE cretacious acid is extricated from its com∣binations in the large way, by three different pro∣cesses, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> by <HI>fermentation,</HI> by the action of a <HI>stronger acid,</HI> and by <HI>heat;</HI> the first method can∣not operate in this instance, the second may have its effects; let us try how far it will explain the subject in question. Suppose this water first con∣taining a marine acid, should have passed over a quantity of cretacious alkali; here the acid con∣tained in ten pounds of it, would unite with 73 grs. of pure alkali, which contained, and accord∣ingly will discharge 58grs. equal 116 square inches of
<PB N="37" REF="026149_0035_0FCF5603850AB1F8"/>
this acid. Now the water is supposed to contain at least 200 inches, hence we see that the most favo∣rable statement of this mode, will not account e∣ven for the quantity of air actually existing as a component part of the water; much less for the great superabundance which is continually bub∣bling up through it, and is discharged. We can∣not suppose that the vitriolic acid, might act on calcarious earth, and discharge this air, whereby the water might become impregnated, before it was charged with sea-salt and alkali; or else we should have detected some glaubers salt in the waters, as they would at the time that they re∣ceived their air, also unavoidably become satur∣ated with gypsum, which when it came in contact with the alkali would have been decomposed thereby, and form this salt.</P>
<P>WE must therefore conclude, that this air must be produced by <HI>subterranean heat,</HI> acting on cal∣carious earth or limestone; thereby setting it at liberty in this great profusion; indeed the deep caverns opening on the lime stone bank before-mentioned, gives some plausibility to this opini∣on, for it clearly evinces that some considerable operations must be going forward in the earth be∣low: the only objection that can be raised against this conjecture is, the coldness of the waters, but this may be obviated by considering, that even if they do not come any great distance after their ae∣rial impregnation; yet they may have afterwards met with their salts, which as is the case with all substances going from the solid to the fluid state,
<PB N="38" REF="026149_0036_0FCF5605D1179858"/>
will absorb a considerable quantity of heat, dur∣ing their dissolution, and thereby produce the coldness in question: should any suppose that this cause is not adequate to the production of the coldness of these waters, they are at liberty to consider them as being aerated at a greater distance from the springs than is suggested; my above ob∣servations however will not permit them to sus∣pect but that the air they contain must have been e∣volved from its combination by subterranean fire, the which is proved, by the heat of the waters of Lebanon, to exist at no great distance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">About 5<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> miles.</NOTE> from these springs.</P>
<P>By the waters running over a bed of sulphur, their alkali may form a hepar with this mineral; the gas discharged from which, may give them their sulphurious impregnation.</P>

<HEAD>A METHOD OF MAKING AN ARTIFICIAL MINERAL WATER, RESEMBLING IN EVERY RESPECT THAT OF SARATOGA.</HEAD>
<P>ONE great advantage resulting from the Analy∣sis of mineral waters is, the being enabled thereby to make artificial waters similar to them, whence all their virtues may be obtained at pleasure; and at any place, without the inconvenience or ex∣pence of attending at the springs.</P>
<P>THERE are some mineral waters, that from the fixed nature of their ingredients, may be kept for a considerable time and transported from place to place without suffering much, if any, alteration in their natures; as for instance those of Epsom,
<PB N="39" REF="026149_0037_0FCF4CC6236C2938"/>
Richmond, Swansey, and the like; while others as those of Pyrmont, Seltser, Saratoga, &amp;c, not∣withstanding our greatest care, can be kept but a short time and consequently cannot be conveyed to any great distance, without loosing in a consid∣erable degree their medicinal qualities; for be∣sides the cretacious acid which from its volatile nature flies off, the iron that was kept in solution thereby, is also deposited; hence they must loose the two most active and essential parts of their com∣position; therefore if any one would have these waters at a distance from the springs, it is art a∣lone that can supply him.</P>
<P>THE manner in which I prepared a water re∣sembling the Saratoga waters, not being possessed of Nooth's apparatus, was as follows: To a quart of simple water, I added 38grs. aerated lime or chalk, 34.6 grs. common salt, and 5.2 aerated mi∣neral alkali; being just the proportion that I ob∣tained from a quart of the mineral water; I also suspended in it some fresh iron filings tied up in a linen rag, then by means of a bottle with a sy∣phon affixed to it, and which also had a mouth whereby I could put in my ingredients, I caused the air that was discharged from chalk by a dilut∣ed vitriolic acid, to pass through the water above∣mentioned, till it appeared to be fully saturated: to this water was then added some coarsely pow∣dered sulphur, which after standing awhile was decanted off.</P>
<P>THIS liquor was now acknowledged by several
<PB N="40" REF="026149_0038_0FCF560691CD30A0"/>
persons who had drank of the Saratoga waters perfectly to resemble them in taste.</P>
<P>MOST of the reagents used on the natural waters, were repeated on these and with like effects; here then is a clear proof of the success of the analysis, for synthesis or the recomposition of a substance, with similar ingredients to what were obtained from it, by all chemists is considered the surest e∣vidence of the truth of an analysis.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING I have not had an opportu∣nity of trying the effects of this water in diseases, yet the above circumstances proving it to be com∣posed of the same ingredients as the natural wa∣ters; leaves no doubt, but that it must possess the same medicinal virtues.</P>
