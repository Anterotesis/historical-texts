<OPENER>TO THE BENEVOLENT CITIZENS,</OPENER>
<P><HI>THOSE of the overseers of the poor, who attend to the care of the unfortunate now labouring under the prevailing malignant disorder, are almost overcome with the fatigue which they undergo, and require immediate assistance. This, it is hoped, may be found among the benevolent citizens, who actuated by a willingness is con∣tribute their aid in the present distress, will offer themselves as volunteers to support the active overseers in the discharge of what they have undertaken. For which purpose, those who are thus humanely disposed, are requested to apply to the Mayor, who will point out to them how they may be useful.</HI></P>

<P>Having made enquiry into the situation of the poor and afflicted, they are of opinion, that it is not in the power of the overseers and guardians of the poor to af∣ford the necessary aid which the cases of the sick require, that the citizens be again convened, in order that some effectual means may be used, and a plan adopted to mitigate, and, if possible, to afford relief to the afflict∣ed, both in the city and at the Hospital at Bush-Hill.</P>

Peter Barriere and Stephen Crousillat attended the committee and informed them, that Joseph Mercier and wife are dead, and have left two infant children, twins, about fifteen months old, without any person to take care of them (or the effects left by the deceased, which are said to be of considerable value) except a servant girl whose character is unknown, which being taken into consideration, it is <HI>resolved,</HI> that James Kerr and John Letch worth be a committee to make enquiry into the circumstances—, obtain an account of the pro∣perty and return it to the committee,—procure suitable places for the infants and take such other measures as may be proper on the occasion.</P>

<P>The Physicians agreeably to notice, attended, viz. Doctors Physick. Cathral, Leib and Annan—when a conference was had respecting the state of the Hos∣pital and the mode of affording medical assistance.</P>
<P>After some time spent upon the subject, the Physici∣ans produced the following propositions.</P>
<Q><PB N="20" REF="027501_0021_0FD490F58E5A7FE0"/>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the Physicians will attend regularly every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay at eleven o'clock in the morning.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That for this attendance they shall have two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a visit each.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That Mr. Graham be prescribing Apothecary, to attend to those patients who are admitted in the absence of the Physicians, and that he be provided with two or more assistants in the Apothecaries duties.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That Doctors Leib, Physick, Cathral and An∣nan, have the entire direction of the Hospital, to be arranged in such manner as they shall judge proper; and that in ease of the indisposition of either, he will provide a medical friend to attend for him.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P>Which being considered, were agreed to, with the addition of the following, viz.</P>
<P>That a room at the Hospital be appropriated to the use of such patients as are desirous of being under the direction of Doctor Deveze: that he procure the ne∣cessary medicine for his patients, to be made up at the expence of the committee, and, if necessary, that he provide a person to administer them.</P>
<P>The <HI>President</HI> produced a letter from a citizen, com∣plaining of the route taken by the carters employed to remove the dead from the Hospital; which being considered it was agreed, that the carters be directed to proceed in future, from the Hospital down broad street to walnut street, thence to the place of inter∣ment.</P>
<P>The prevailing calamity having deprived a number of children of their parents and guardians, and render∣ed many of the latter who have survived, incapable of
<PB N="21" REF="027501_0022_0FD4912049B857A0"/>
a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ording those under their care the necessary suppor and protection;</P>
<P>The committee conceive it to be a duty incumbent on them to attend to these, as well as to sufferers of other descriptions who are labouring under the pre∣vailing disorder, and to use their endeavours to provide for their comfortable accommodation and support.</P>
<P>On motion; <HI>Resolved,</HI> that a house be provided for the accommodation of such; and that suitable provision be made for their support: that Israel Israel, James Kerr and Thomas Harrison be a committee to carry the foregoing resolution into execution.</P>
<P>The managers <HI>Report</HI> that there are a variety of ar∣ticles wanted for the use of the Hospital, which are directed to be obtained and forwarded as soon as pos∣sible.</P>
<P>Doctors Cathral, Leib and Physick attended at the Hospital this day.</P>
<P>The Physicians anxiously wish that the committee would endeavour to prevail upon our fellow citizens to send those who are designed for the Hospital, as early as possible after they take the disorder; as the chance of recovery in case of an immediate removal is very flat∣tering, but that the contrary must be expected to be the consequence of delay. The Secretary is directed to cause this to be published in the news papers.</P>
<P>The managers report, that they have buried eight persons from the Hospital since last evening, Seventeen have been sent out, and orders were issued for the in∣terment of six persons this day, from the City-Hall.</P>
<P>Twenty patients not visited.</P>

<P>There being a number of French sailors and soldiers in the Prison, belonging to the army and navy of the Republic of France, at the suit of the minister of that Republic, whose continuance may be attended with alarming consequences should the prevailing disorder be introduced into the prison, it becomes an indispen∣sible duty to use means to have them removed as early as possible,—The Mayor is requested to write to the

<P>That he hath left all his estate to his brother William Tate, of the Western Country, the property which he had in possession at the Hospital when he died, was collected and brought to the committee to be delivered to his executors.</P>
<P>Doctor Physick attended the committee, and in∣formed them, that he was willing to take charge of one half of the Hospital, which was agreed to, but the compensation to him as well as to Doctor Deveze, was by their desire deferred until a future time.</P>
<P>Several applications being made by poor and distres∣sed objects, suffering in consequence of the prevailing calamity, who cannot obtain relief from the overseers of the poor, on account of their absence, or be admit∣ted into the house of employment by reason of the refusal of the managers to admit them; their cases were taken into consideration, and it was,</P>
<P><HI>Resolved,</HI> that Israel Israel, Joseph Inskeep and John Letchworth be a committee to receive applications from the poor, and administer such relief as their circum∣stances may render proper and necessary.</P>
<P><HI>Resolved,</HI> that Israel Israel, Joseph Inskeep and Thomas Harrison be a committee to visit the house of employment, to enquire of the steward of that place,
<PB N="26" REF="027501_0027_0FD490FE87873F00"/>
what are the circumstances of it, and whether any of the managers attend there, and whether suitable objects can obtain the relief designed to be afforded by the institution.</P>
<P>The last mentioned committee <HI>Report,</HI> <Q>that they have been to the alms-house and have had a conference with the steward; who informed them that the last meeting of the managers was on the ninth day of this month, when a resolution was entered into "that no person should be admitted into that place until further orders." that on the sixteenth instant, two members only met, when the foregoing instructions to the stew∣ard were renewed.</Q></P>
<P>They were informed that the house is capable of ac∣commodating two hundred patients more than it at present contains; which being considered, it was <HI>Re∣solved</HI> that the managers be requested to meet the com∣mittee to morrow morning at nine o'clock in order to consult upon means, for affording relief to the afflicted, not labouring under the prevailing disease.</P>
<P>Doctor Physick being present, the consideration of the state of the Hospital and the most eligible mode of affording medical aid was again entered upon. After considerable time spent upon the subject it was <HI>Agreed,</HI> that it would be most advisable to divide the Hospital into three divisions, that there be three Physicians ap∣pointed, and that the committee immediately proceed to an election of Physicians to attend the Hospital agreeably to the regulations now concluded on: when Doctors Physick, Leib and Deveze were duly elected. The Secretary is directed to inform them of their electi∣on and to request their attendance to morrow morning at nine o'clock.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM requested by the Common Council of this city to inform you, that the committee appointed <Q>to prevent the introduction and spreading of infecti∣ous diseases,</Q> consisting of seven members expressly chosen for the purpose by the citizens at large, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="64" REF="027501_0065_0FD491654D43B0E0"/>
equal number of the members of our board, of which Mr. John Broome is the chairman, have laid before the board copies of the correspondence, between them and you on the subject of supplies to be furnished by the citizens of this city, for the relief of the poorer and more distressed of your fellow citizens, under the heavy pressure of their present calamity and that dis∣organized state of your city police, which must neces∣sarily attend so unexpected and afflicting a dispensati∣on of Divine Providence.</P>
<P>Although I sincerely lament the cause of this corres∣pondence, it is with pleasure I do announce to you that the Common Council of this city, deeply impres∣sed with the awful judgment of the Almighty on the American Nation, in permitting a pestilential disease to lay waste and disorganize that once populous, well regulated and flourishing sister city, the seat of Em∣pire, by destroying the lives of many valuable patriots and citizens and by driving many others of its nume∣rous and very opulent and useful inhabitants into ex∣ile, they have caused five thousand dollars to be plac∣ed in my hands, and have directed it to be paid to the order of the Chief Magistrate of Philadelphia, and they have requested me to advise you of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>is measure and to pray you to draw on me therefor; you will there∣fore be pleased to draw upon me for that sum; at sight, and your bill will be duly honored.</P>
<P>May Almighty God, in condescending mercy to your devoted city, speedily stay the progress of the de∣solating disease and <HI>say it is enough;</HI> may he restore to their homes your banished fellow citizens and sanctify his past judgments to all; and may you Sir, and those with you who have remained faithful to your trust
<PB N="65" REF="027501_0066_0FD49194A3D15F60"/>
and borne the heat and burden of the day, in the midst of surrounding and threatning dangers be the peculiar care of Heaven, is the sincere wish and prayer of</P>

<HEAD>At a Common Council held on Friday the 11th day of Oc∣tober 1793.</HEAD>
<P>RESOLVED, that this board will provide the sum of five thousand dollars, for the relief of the poor∣er and most distressed citizens of Philadelphia, under the pressure of their present great calamity.</P>

<P>On <HI>Motion Resolved,</HI> That a committee be appoint∣ed to settle the accounts of the different members of the committee who have received monies from the treasurer, and that John Connelly and James Shars∣wood be this committee.</P>
<P><HI>Resolved,</HI> That the secretary apply to Mazrie and William Boyce for their assistance in taking charge of the property of the orphan children, who now are or
<PB N="66" REF="027501_0067_0FD49166C78DE238"/>
hereafter may become objects of the care of this com∣mittee.</P>
<P><HI>Resolved,</HI> That a well qualified accountant be em∣ployed, for keeping the accounts of the committee, and that Matthew Carey, be appointed to procure one.</P>
<P>That an exact list be obtained of the daily burials in each ground in this city and vicinity.</P>
<P>From accounts received from different quarters of the city, it is evident that the disorder now raging, has for the last week been more general and alarming than at any time since its appearance—its greatest height being about the 12th, the mortality at the Hos∣pital also at that period, being greater than at any o∣ther time.</P>
<P>Whether it is owing to the extreme malignancy of the disease, neglect, or delay of sending the patients to the Hospital in the early stage of the disease can∣not be determined; it is remarkable that the greater part of those who die, terminate their existence with∣in three days after their admission, many on the next day after, and frequent instances occur of their dy∣ing on the passage to the Hospital.</P>
<P>The managers <HI>Report,</HI> that sixteen men and four women have this day been received into the Hospital and five men, and five women buried from thence.</P>
<P>John Scriminger; Mary, John, Margaret, Norry and George Grogan; Kitty King; Elizabeth Neaves and Ann M'Glaugh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in, were admited into the Orphan House.</P>

The part Sir! which you personally take in our af∣flictions and which you have so pathetically expressed in your letter, excites in the breasts of the committee the warmest sensations of fraternal affection.</P>
<P>The refreshing rain which fell the day before yester∣day, though light, and the cool weather which hath succeeded, appear to have given a check to the preva∣lence of the disorder; of this we have satisfactory proofs; as well in the decrease of the funerals, as in the applications for removal to the Hospital.</P>
<P>I have at your request, this day drawn upon you, at sight, in favor of the President and Directors of the Bank of North-America, for the sum of five thousand dollars, the benevolent donation of the Common Coun∣cil of the city of New-York.</P>

Received a letter from Peter Gordon and Abraham G. Claypoole dated Trenton, 23d October, informing that a subscription was begun there for the relief of the poor and distressed citizens of Philadelphia and re∣questing to be informed whether money or other arti∣cles would be most acceptable.</P>
<P>To this letter an answer was returned.</P>
<P>A letter from Joseph Potts of Potts-Grove 22d Inst. was received, informing of his having forwarded two hundred and twelve fowls from the inhabitants of Douglass township, to Peter Robinson's Mill for the use of the poor; Henry Deforest, is requested to send a waggon for them.</P>
<P>Received one hundred and sixty dollars from the in∣habitants of Norris-Town, by the hands of John Pugh and Thomas W. Tallman for the use of the sick.</P>
<P>The committe appointed to the care of the orphans made the following <HI>Report,</HI> of their proceedings, which the Secretary is directed to hand to the Printer of the Federal Gazette for publication, viz.</P>
<Q><TEXT>
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="report">
<P>To the committee appointed for the relief of the sick and poor, afflicted with the prevailing malignant disease.</P>
<P>The committee appointed to the care of the orphans <HI>Report,</HI> that on the 19th September, they engaged a house belonging to William Ralston, in fifth street, for the accommodation of the orphans under the care of the committee: and on the same day they engaged Mary Parvin as Matron, and placed thirteen children under her care; and between that time and the 13th October fourteen more were added to their number.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="027501_0082_0FD491A8DBFE9C58"/>
That from the frequent applications for admissions, it was necessary to procure a more commodious place, which, by direction of the committee they obtained. This house was formerly occupied, and is now known by the name of the Loganian Library: it is the proper∣ty of John Swanwick, Esq. and although it was rented to a person who then occupied it, the exertions of that Gentleman soon prevailed, and we obtained possession, with the concurrence of the tenant, on the 1st Instant.</P>
<P>Your committee further <HI>Report,</HI> that from that time to the present, they have employed three men and sev∣en women to assist the matron.</P>
<P>That they have agreed with Doctor Samuel Duffield to visit the house, and afford such medical aid as may be necessary; and they doubt not but from the well-known character of this Gentleman, that due attention will be paid to such cases as may require his assistance.</P>
<P>That the children have now become so numerous, that notwithstanding additional buildings have been erect∣ed for the purposes of washing, &amp;c. they found it ne∣cessary to add another room of about 30 feet by 14, which it is expected will soon be completed.</P>
<P>That from the first establishment of this institution to this day, there hath been one hundred and fifty nine children admitted, forty three of whom are now out at nurse, who appear to be well taken care of; thirty one have been delivered to their relations or friends, eight have died, viz. six of those who were at nurse and two in the house; seventy seven remain in the house and are in general healthy and cheerful.</P>
<P>That your committee are perfectly satisfied with the conduct of the matron, as well as of those who are em∣ployed under her direction.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="027501_0083_0FD49179826F2370"/>
It may not be improper to remark; that many of the children have not lost both their parents; but when one of them is deceased, and the other sick, it has been the uniform practice of the committee to admit the chil∣dren into the house.</P>
<P>The committee will only add, that they keep regu∣lar minutes of their proceedings, which are always o∣pen to the inspection of the members of the general committee</P>

<SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT was notified to me a few days ago, that you want∣ed the house in sixth street, known formerly under the name of Logan's Library, part whereof I then occupied, for the purpose of accommodating the orphan children, who have lost their parents, by the unhappy disorder which now rages in our city, and the care whereof you have humanely taken upon you. The house was par∣ticularly calculated on account of its situation and the height of its cicling, for the purpose of my works; I had made some repairs to the windows and a close<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the garret, and in order better to secure the possession of the house—I have paid forty eight dollars, or one half years rent, before hand: but knowing that private convenience and emolument must always give way to public utility and particularly at a time of general cala∣mity as the present is, I thought it my duty to submit
<PB N="83" REF="027501_0084_0FD491AA42E0D100"/>
without opposition, and found myself happy to have it in my power to contribute my mite towards your bene∣volent purposes; I therefore cheerfully removed to the house pointed out to me, though far less suitable to my purposes than the one I have quitted, and will most willingly content myself there, until times alter; I only wish to know upon what terms I am in the house I now occupy, what the rent thereof is and who is to pay it, as I can hardly think, that it is expected I shall pay the rent here again, having paid in the other house the rent before hand until the 18th day of January next as before mentioned. I have therefore thought it my duty to lay these circumstances before you, and humbly beg that you will be pleased to give me the necessary elucidation in this respect, and that in case circumstances should render the house in sixth street no longer necessary for your purposes, you will be pleased to give me the preference to re-enter into the same again.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am with the greatest respect, Gentlemen, Your most Obedient humble Servant, AMBROSE VARINOT.</SIGNED>
To the committee appointed to take care of the or∣phans who have lost their parents in the present disease.
<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>P. S. If it should please the committee to indemnify me with respect to the rent I have advanced, and the repairs made, I could suit myself until such time, the committee shall have no further use for the house in sixth street.</P>

<SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PERMIT your fellow citizens of Bucks county, to detain your attention a few moments from your lau∣dable and unremitted exertions in the cause of human∣ity—Equally impressed with a sense of the obligation,
<PB N="87" REF="027501_0088_0FD491B044A95FE8"/>
which as men, and citizens of the same common coun∣try, we are all under to afford each other every assistance in our power, they request that you would suffer them to share the honors of benevolence, and partake with you in the offices of social affection—The exemption of their particular district from the dreadful calamity which now afflicts your devoted city, far from creating an indolent or unfeeling security, suggests to their minds only the idea of what ought to be expected from them and every other citizen of our hitherto prosperous community on this lamentable occasion; for they can conceive no more acceptable method of testifying their thankfulness to the All-wise disposer of human events, for his particular mercy towards them, than by entertaining a proper tenderness for the sufferings of their fellow-men, and a chearful readiness to nar∣row the dominions of distress—They would also con∣sider themselves as having rejected all regard for the social tie, if, whilst members of other societies are voluntarily coming forward with offers of assistance, they should be remiss in their endeavours to alleviate the misery of our fellow citizens—Under these impres∣sions a number of the inhabitants of Bucks County con∣vened upon public business, joined by others whom a common principle of benevolence had associated with them, came to certain resolves, a copy of which will be found inclosed, for the purpose of procuring re∣lief for the sick, and poor inhabitants of Philadelphia. Their distance from the scene of calamity not permit∣ting them to afford any other aid than a pecuniary on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, they appointed the committee who now address you to make the necessary arrangements for the collection of donations throughout the county, on the charita∣ble occasion. The committee have accordingly met,
<PB N="88" REF="027501_0089_0FD49181C33117C8"/>
and taken every step in their power to execute the charge entrusted to them; and they are happy to in∣form the committee of Philadelphia that such is the general disposition of the inhabitants of the county, that they are confident their donations will do no dis∣credit to their charity towards the distressed, or their affection for their fellow citizens—The monies collect∣ed will be lodged with the treasurer of the county, and wait the order of the committee of Philadelphia. What we wish principally at present is, that you would inform us of the place where, and the persons to whom you would wish the payments to be made; A letter therefore upon this head directed to the chairman of the committee will meet with due attention—In the mean time be assured that we are the friends of our fellow citizens, and particularly of those who are in distress: And may the great Ruler of the universe who ever chastens with the tenderness of 2 parent, look with compassion upon the sufferings of his chil∣dren, and put a period to their afflictions—We remain, worthy fellow citizens with esteem and sincerity,</P>

be a committee to wait upon the directors of the Bank of North-America and take up the obligations delivered for the payment of the two sums of money borrowed of that institution, the first of 1500 dollars and second of 5000 Dollars.</P>
<P><HI>Resolved,</HI> that a committee be appointed to confer with a committee of the ASSISTANT COMMITTEE con∣cerning a plan for affording relief to the suffering citi∣zens whose modesty may prevent their obtaining that relief which their circumstances require.

<P>It having pleased Divine Providence to favor us with an agreeable prospect of returning health to our long afflicted city—And as several of the members of the committee are desirous of attending their respect∣ive places of worship, it is <HI>Agreed,</HI> that those who have no indispensible duties to perform at the City-Hall, be at liberty to withdraw their attendance to mor∣row.

<P>They however strongly recommend to the absent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of Philadelphia, not to return for a week or ten days, or until there shall be a considerable fall of rain; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of air might prove dangerous, and probably <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to many.</P></Q>

previous to their being reoccupied, they cause them to be well aired for several days, by opening all the windows and chamber doors, in order that a free circulation of air may take place.</P>
<P>Burning of nitre will correct the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oul air which they may contain.</P>

<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>The inattention of a number of the inhabitants, in whose houses the late disorder hath prevailed, in not opening and cleansing them, agreeably to the re∣commendations frequently repeated, hath induced this committee in conjunction with the assistant commit∣tee to enter into the following resolutions.</P>
<P><HI>Resolved,</HI> that it is highly expedient to have all houses and stores in the city and liberties, wherever the malignant fever prevailed, purified and cleansed as speed∣ily and compleatly as possible: and to have all those well aired, which have been closed for any length of time; and that it be recommended to the citizens to have unslacked lime thrown into their privies.</P>
<P><HI>Resolved,</HI> that the members of these committees will exert themselves, in their several districts, to have the foregoing resolve carried into effect; and that where the districts are too large for the respective members, they be hereby empowered to call in such respectable characters to their assistance, as may be necessary, and who may be disposed to co-operate in this business.</P>

the requisition of the members appointed to carry these resolves into effect, he or they shall be reported to the next Grand-Jury, for the city or county, as supporting a nuisance dangerous to the public welfare.</P></Q>

<P>Also another letter from William Smith and Fre∣derick Sieger, dated Earl district, Lancaster county, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1st ultimo, informing that the inhabitants of that township had collected a parcel of wheat for the pur∣pose of being manufactured into flour for the use of the poor; and requesting that the committee would give instructions how, and to whom the same shall be directed.</P>
<P>The president is requested to answer these letters.</P>

The orphan-committee <HI>Report,</HI> that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>, one of the orphans who was at nurse, was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this day.</P>
<P>The committee on admissions and burials <HI>Report,</HI> that they have not admitted or buried any, except the orphan abovementioned.</P>
<P>The committee on distributions <HI>Report,</HI> that they have relieved one hundred and seventy two families: distributed one hundred and twenty eight dollars and seventy five cents, twelve and a quarter cords of wood, and two hundred and ninety loaves of bread.</P>
<P>The return of health to the city affording much con∣solation to the committe, it was on motion <HI>Agreed,</HI> to cause the following communication to be printed for the information of our fellow-citizens.</P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>After the long continued distress with which our city hath been afflicted, the committee have the happi∣ness to congratulate their fellow-citizens upon the re∣turn of as great a degree of health, they unanimously believe, as usually prevails at this season of the year.</P>
<P>They have heard of no new cases in the malignant fever for many days; and they have great reason to suppose that there will not remain any vestige of it in the city or suburbs after a few days.</P>
<P>Applications for admission to the hospital at Bush-Hill have ceased; Of ninety one patients who still re∣main there, the physicians are not apprehensive of los∣ing above three or four: The convalescents increase daily.</P>
<P>Among the great number of our citizens who re∣tired to the country, it doth not appear that one of them hath been attacked by the disorder since their re∣turn;
<PB N="121" REF="027501_0122_0FD491D49DAE3C70"/>
reports to the contrary have been circulated, which upon investigation have proved to be false.</P>
<P>Purifying the houses where the disorder hath been, is essentially necessary to prevent future in∣fection. The committee think it incumbent upon them to repeat to their fellow-citizens, and to urge in the most pressing manner, the performance of this impor∣tant duty.</P>
<P>Clothing, either for the body or beds, which hath been made use of by the sick, and more particularly for those who have died of the disorder, should be wash∣ed, baked, buried or destroyed. The loss which would attend a total destruction, will not, it is hoped, be put in competition with the life or health of an individual, much less with those of the community.</P>
<P>The committee are of opinions, that our fugitive brethren, as well as others, who have business to trans∣act, may safely come to the city, without danger from the late prevailing disorder.</P></Q>
<P>The managers <HI>Report,</HI> that they received no pati∣ents, that they have buried one man and one woman—and sent one to the convalescent house.</P>
<P>An order was issued this day from the City Hall for the interment of one person.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I am desirous to lay before the Legislature, a particular statement of the circumstances, that have at∣tended the calamity, with which the city has recently been visited; and as your benevolent exertions have afforded the best opportunity of information on the subject; permit me to request the favor of such answers, as you may be able to give to the following enquiries.</P>
<P>At what time and place did the disorder make its appearance; and to what quarters of the city did its ravages extend?</P>
<P>How many citizens have died since the commence∣ment of the disorder; how many recovered, who had been afflicted with it; and what number of orphans have been deprived of their parents on this occasion?</P>
<P>What accommodations and supplies were provid∣ed for the sick and poor; what monies have been dis∣bursed, and what debts have been incurred?</P>
<P>What is the amount of the charitable contribu∣tions for the relief of the sick and poor, distinguish∣ing between the amount of the actual grants and en∣gagements, by way of security, to the Bank, for mak∣ing loans?</P>
<P>What measures are necessary to purify the city from any latent infection; and what general precau∣tions ought to be taken to guard against a similar cala∣mity in future?</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="027501_0128_0FD491D8C4D2E8B8"/>
The same motives, which prompt me to make this application, will induce you, gentlemen, to excuse it; and, I am confident, that we may all securely trust to the sympathy and liberality of the Legislature, for aid and support, as well to defray the recent expences, as to provide against the return of so great a calami∣ty.</P>

<P>The committee for the relief of the sick and poor of the city of Philadelphia, in reply to the several que∣ries proposed to them by the Governor, answer;</P>
<P>To the first:</P>
<P>That the malignant disorder, by which so many of our citizens have been taken off, made its first appear∣ance about the latter end of July, in Water Street.</P>
<P>Its ravages were for some time confined to that street, between Mulberry and Sassafras streets; from thence it extended northwardly up Water street to Vine Street. Front street, within the above limits, was next attacked, whence it spread into the parallel streets, up those which run East and West; the greatest ha∣voc being nearest the river Delaware, and becoming
<PB N="128" REF="027501_0129_0FD4921B85444058"/>
more feeble in its progress to the Westward; this will more clearly appear from the account of the number of houses, &amp;c. in the different streets, lanes and al∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ys in the city and suburbs, hereunto subjoined.</P>
<P>To the second:</P>
<P>The committee have procured pretty accurate lists from the several burial grounds in and about the city, of the interments from the first day of August to the ninth day of November; from these it appears that Four thousand and thirty one persons, of all ages, sex∣es and disorders, have been buried during that pe∣riod:</P>
<P>It is impracticable to discriminate the number taken off by the malignant disorder, no accounts having been kept by the sextons, or other persons, to whom the re∣gistering of burials was committed, except in two in∣stances, viz. in the burial grounds belonging to Christ-Church and St. Peters.</P>
<P>There are no data from which the committee can form a calculation as to the number of those who hav∣ing been afflicted with the disorder, have recovered.</P>
<P>The committee have received into their care since the commencement of the disorder, one hundred and ninety one children, who have either lost one or both of their parents and the survivors being sick or so much reduced in circumstances as to render the attention of the committee absolutely necessary.</P>
<P>The whole number admitted into the orphan-house, and the present state of it is as follows, viz.</P>
<P>Admitted one hundred and ninety one: Died se∣venteen: Returned to their friends forty nine: There remain one hundred and twenty five, of which at pre∣sent
<PB N="129" REF="027501_0130_0FD491DED2FB0DF8"/>
there are in the house eighty one, and of infants at nurse forty four.</P>
<P>The committee are so much affected by the situation of the orphans under their care, that they beg leave to recommend them in a particular manner to the Gov∣ernor's notice.</P>
<P>To the Third:</P>
<P>At the first appearance of the disorder the general consternation was so great, that those whose particular province it was to take care of the poor, knew not how to act; terror soon put them all to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>light, except three, whose exertions merit the highest encomiums; worn down with fatigue, a call was made upon the be∣nevolent citizens to come to their aid, a meeting of a few took place, who voluntarily offered their services in the dangerous undertaking. A second meeting was obtained, when a committee consisting of twenty se∣ven persons was appointed the majority of whom un∣dertook the task, but from death and other causes the business was principally conducted by twelve only. This committee formed themselves into sub-commit∣tees to whom different parts of the business was asign∣ed—One of which undertook the extreme hazardous part of attending at and managing the hospital at Bush-Hill; Another to receive applications for the removal of the sick to the hospital, and of burying the dead.</P>
<P>The great increase of deaths soon left a number of children without parents or friends to whom to apply for protection; some of those were found in the houses from whence their parents had just been remov∣ed to the silent grave, deploring their loss in the great∣est agonies of distress.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="027501_0131_0FD4921D112F5678"/>
A committee was appointed to provide a house for their reception; a matron and nurses were employed.</P>
<P>As the effects naturally resulting from the accumu∣lated distress of the more indigent citizens, many of them were reduced to such a situation as to require im∣mediate supplies of the necessaries of life.</P>
<P>For this purpose another committee was appointed, who have for several weeks past daily distributed to about two hundred families, for one week's support, of the following articles, which have amounted upon an average to four hundred and forty loaves of bread, fifteen cords of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ood, one hundred and fifty dollars in money, per day, besides meat, meal, vegetables, &amp;c.</P>
<P>A number of citizens undertook to act as an ASSIS∣TANT COMMITTEE in recommending suitable objects for those supplies.</P>
<P>The whole amount of disbursements for the various objects already mentioned is not less than Twenty thou∣sand dollars; the particulars, cannot yet be ascertained with precision.</P>
<P>To the Fourth:</P>
<P>The charitable contributions already received in mo∣ney amount to Twenty two thousand dollars. Some of our fellow-citizens, individuals of the committee, before it was known that one dollar would be contri∣buted by donations, borrowed upon their personal se∣curity of the Bank of North America, six thousand five hundred dollars; others of our fellow-citizens have since signed a guarantee to that bank, to make good the amount of fifteen thousand dollars, if the committee should have occasion for further loans.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="027501_0132_0FD491E04B7DB238"/>
The committee having thought it a measure ex∣tremely requisite in order to purify the city from the latent infection, that respectable citizens should be re∣quested to undertake the trouble of going to every house where any person had been sick, or in which any had died of the disorder, to recommend it to the pos∣sessors, to cause them to be opened and thoroughly cleansed.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen who had before undertaken to act as an ASSISTANT COMMITTEE, cheerfully added this to their labours; they have made considerable progress in the business, and by their exertions will undoubtedly execute it in the most satisfactory manner, as far as their influence can extend. There are some refracto∣ry persons who either insensible of the danger to which themselves and their fellow citizens may be exposed from a non-compliance, or from obstinacy, occasion some difficulty. It is hoped that this, as well as prop∣er means to cause all infected clothing, and more espe∣cially beds and bedding, to be purified or destroyed, will attract the Legislative attention.</P>
<P>The precautions necessary to be taken to guard a∣gainst a similar calamity in future, will require much consideration. The committee are of opinion that a health-officer, upon a more extensive plan than the pre∣sent, is of the greatest importance, and that the resi∣dence of the officer and physicians should be at a suit∣able distance below the city.</P>
<P>That a healthful spot for the site of an hospital, nearly contiguous to the city, easily accessible by land and water, together with requisite buildings for the accommodation of those who may be attacked by ma∣lignant
<PB N="132" REF="027501_0133_0FD4921E812F8338"/>
disorders in future, are among the most neces∣sary means for the purpose of prevention.</P>
<P>From the want of such a place, to which the sick might have been removed, at an early period of the late disorder, may be ascribed the great terror which incapacitated the inhabitants from giving that assistance to their fellow-citizens, by which many hundred lives might have been saved.</P>
<P>The increasing trade of the city, and the great num∣ber of people who are daily arriving from all parts of the world, expose us to every species of infection that prevails in other places, the necessity of efficient mea∣sures being immediately taken to guard against future dangers become therefore indispensible.</P>

<P>As the disease has now abated and many of the children in the orphan house may have connections who do not know where they are,—the committee were of the opinion that it would be advisable to publish a list of those remaining under their care; requesting the surviving relatives, if any there be, to call and take them away; It was on <HI>Motion Agreed,</HI> that the follow∣ing advertisement be published, in order that their con∣nections be informed of their situation and the com∣mittee be relieved from their charge.</P>

<P>The orphans remaining under the care of the com∣mittee, being the principal objects of their anxiety, they consider them as a deposit in their hands, for which they ought to give the most exact account; they therefore are of opinion that the first measure necessa∣ry to be taken for the benefit of those innocents, is to publish a list of their names, informing their relations and friends that the committee are ready to deliver them to their nearest connections. In doing this, it is to be understood, that the most satisfactory testimo∣ny will be required in support of every claim.</P>

The committee to whom was referred the applica∣tion on behalf of the French soldiers, to be received at Bush-Hill until a suitable place can be provided for them, <HI>Report</HI> that they may be conveniently accommo∣dated in the house at present appropriated for the con∣valescent, whose number is now much reduced, and may be safely removed into other appartments;</P>
<P>That the soldiers may be supported without injury to the donations of the contributors, at eight shillings per diem per man, including all charges; which they submit to the committee.</P>
<P>The committee, commiserating the distressed situ∣ation of the sick and wounded Frenchmen who lately arrived from Cape-Francois, in the citizen Marseillois, and desirous of preventing the introduction of new calamities by the introduction of diseased persons from the West-India islands, where malignant disorders are now prevalent, did on the 16th Instant, upon the pressing solicitation of the secretary of the French Le∣gation agree to admit them into that part of the hos∣pital at Bush-Hill, hitherto occupied by the convales∣cent, for their present relief; under the assurance of the secretary that they should be removed as speedily as possible, to a place to be provided for them by the minister of the French Republic: And as there is a pleasing prospect that our fellow-citizens, for whose accommodation the hospital was established, will shortly be in a situation to return to their friends in the city, it was <HI>Resolved,</HI> that the secretary of the Legation be informed that the sick and wounded now at the hospi∣tal may be accommodated at that place at eight shillings per man, per day; and that the committee will furnish them with every accommodation and supply, necessary

<P>Thirteen barrels of flour were received from the inhabitants of Manheim township, Lancaster county, accompanied by a letter from Martin Mayer, which was answered.</P>
<P>As the business of the committee is drawing to a close, it was considered as an indispensible duty that compensation be made for the use of the property, which hath been accupied by our afflicted fellow-citi∣zens, as an hospital at Bush-Hill: The subject was again brought before the committee, and after fully considering the circumstances of the business, it was <HI>Agreed,</HI> that the proprietor be presented with two thou∣sand dollars for the time it hath been occupied as an hospital, and until the 25th day of March, 1795. As there are fears existing in the minds of some of our fellow-citizens that the disease may again make its ap∣pearance in the spring; and there being at present no provision made for the accommodation of such as may be afflicted with malignant disorders, it was thought adviseable that endeavours be made to retain the privi∣lege of re-occupying that place, for the like purpose. The committee, to whom is entrusted the management of this business, are requested to use their endeavours to effect the object of the committee.</P>
<P>It was further agreed that the committee appropri∣ate five hundred dollars for repairs of said hospital; which may now be presented to the proprietor, should it be more agreeable to him to make the repairs him∣self; if not, that it be reserved in trust for that pur∣pose.</P>

<P>The secretary informed the committee that he hath received from the inhabitants of Chestertown town∣ship, Chester county, by the hands of Matthias Pen∣nebecker, secretary of the association in that township, three drafts for two hundred and eighty dollars, viz. one on Phineas Bond, the British consul, for one hun∣dred dollars; one on John Travis for fifty dollars; one on Edward Cadwalader for fifty dollars; being the sums respectively subscribed by them for the use of the poor; also one other draft for eighty dollars, on Charles Shoemaker: the whole being the amount of the subscriptions of the aforesaid township for the use of the poor under our care.

<HEAD>To the Committee for the relief of the sick, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>As a manager of the Hospital at Bush-Hill and the one who organised that institution, I think that as we are advancing toward the moment of closing the busi∣ness intrusted to our care by our fellow-citizens, it is my duty to state to you my ideas upon that subject <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the following manner:</P>
<P>FIRST. That the managers shall not admit into the Hospital any patients to become chargeable to the pub∣lic, except those who may have an order of admit∣tance from the committee, and the managers shall also take proper steps to reduce as much as possible the ex∣penses of said Hospital.</P>
<P>SECOND. The convalescents, old, aged or infirm persons, now in the hospital, shall be immediately dis∣charged.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="027501_0164_0FD49C5D8DB92348"/>
THIRD. The sick in the Mansion-house shall be ta∣ken care of until they are fit to be discharged or re∣moved with safety.</P>
<P>FOURTH. Two or more members of the committee should be appointed to wait on the Minister of the French Republic, with directions to give him notice of the approach of our dissolution, and to request him to provide a place for the reception of his sick now in the Hospital at Bush-Hill, and also to ask of the said Minister the payment of a bill handed to him by the committee, which is still unpaid.</P>
<P>FIFTH. That the committee will take into their consideration the services which Mrs. Mary Saville, matron of said Hospital, has rendered to our sick bre∣thren in that institution, and make to this valuable woman such compensation as they shall think adequate to her merit.</P>
<P>SIXTH. That a sufficient sum of money be imme∣diately borrowed, either from the banks or private ci∣tizens, in the name of the committee, for the purpose of paying and discharging every debt, &amp;c. relative to the Hospital of Bush-Hill, and contracted by the com∣mittee since the 16th of September last.</P>
<P>SEVENTH. At the period of the dissolution of the Hospital—an inventory of every article belonging to it should be made, and after having cleansed the house, goods and furniture, that the goods should be stored, together with the drugs, medicine, &amp;c. belonging to the apothecaries and doctors department, in one or more rooms of the Mansion-house under lock.</P>
<P>EIGHTH. With regard to the property belonging to deceased patients at the Hospital of Bush-Hill, depo∣sited by the managers in the hand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the committee,
<PB N="164" REF="027501_0165_0FD49C23376A62D8"/>
consisting of Twenty two pounds five shillings and five pence in money, five pocket-books or bundles of pa∣per, three silver watches, seven pairs of silver buckles, one pair of silver buttons, one silver tea-spoon, five gold rings, three and a half pairs of ear-rings, and one box.</P>
<P>I shall make the following proposals:</P>
<P>NINTH. The money, say twenty two pounds five shillings and five pence, to be lodged in the hands of the treasurer.</P>
<P>TENTH. The papers and pocket-books, with the in∣ventory of the same, to be deposited in the hands of the secretary.</P>
<P>ELEVENTH. The silver watches, buckles, &amp;c. to be delivered to Mr. Connelly, with directions to sell those articles at vendue, and to render an account thereof to the committee, and the nett proceeds, into the hands of the treasurer.</P>

<P>The committee appointed to inspect the state of the Hospital <HI>Report,</HI> that they have attended to that service, that they have discharged eleven of the patients, and that they are of opinion, that although there still remain some in a very feeble and low state, yet that the whole may with care be removed, in a few days, without material injury, most of them being in a fair way of recovery; those having habitations in the city will be able to provide for themselves, after gaining a little more strength: there yet remain fifteen in the Hospital.</P>
<P>Whereupon it was <HI>Resolved,</HI></P>
<P>That the committee continue their attention to the business and have the house cleared, the nurses and at∣tendants discharged, and the accounts prepared, in or∣der to a sinal closure of the business of the committee.</P>
<P>The committee appointed to consider the services of the matron, and what compensation should be made to her in addition to the stipulated wages at which she was employed to conduct her department at the Hos∣pital,
<PB N="166" REF="027501_0167_0FD49C24384CEEF0"/>
<HI>Report,</HI> that they have made enquiry into her conduct and services, and find that they have been highly commendable; that she hath performed her du∣ties with great propriety and fidelity; that her unre∣mitted care of the numerous sick, her sympathetic and maternal attention to the afflicted not only merits the approbation of the committee, but justly entitles her to the grateful acknowledgements of her fellow-citi∣zens, and that she ought to be presented with a further compensation, as a reward and in testimony of the sentiments which the committee entertain of her ser∣vices. Which report being approved, it was <HI>Agreed,</HI> that the compensation shall be determined at a future meeting.</P>
<P>Israel Israel, John Connelly and Caleb Lownes were appointed to wait on the Minister of France, and in∣form him,—that the committee are bringing their business to a close, that it will not be in their power longer to continue their care of the sick French citizens, who were received at Bush-Hill by request of the secretary of the French Legation; that although by agree∣ment they were to be removed when the sick citizens should be discharged, they may nevertheless remain where they are, until a suitable place can be obtained, to which they may be removed, with convenience to them and our fellow-citizens; subject however to the directions of the trustees who have that place under their care.</P>
<P>On <HI>Motion Resolved,</HI> that the President, S. Girard, James Sharswood, John Letchworth, Thomas Wistar, John Connelly and Caleb Lownes, be a committee to enquire into the unfinished business necessary to be brought forward, and report thereon.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>In our answer to the Governor's letter, respecting our opinion in taking the necessary steps to prevent as much as possible, a future calamity in the city and sub∣urbs, we have omitted that essential part of cleansing the docks, which the filth and dirtiness at low water contributes greatly in giving an infectious air through the whole city.</P>
<P>In order to make proper observations on that subject, I propose to leave it to a committee of four, who will report thereon the next meeting.</P>

One hundred and thirty one dollars were received from Darby, by the hands of Thomas Parke, and twenty dollars and seventy five cents from Moor's-town, by the hands of Richard Smith.</P>
<P>The committee appointed to discharge the patients, nurses, &amp;c. from Bush-Hill <HI>Report,</HI> that they have dis∣charged all those that were able to remove to the city; that those who were indigent and infirm, and had no other means of relief, are sent to the Alms-House; that they have discharged all the nurses and attendants, except the matron and women employed in washing the bedding, and other articles necessary to be preserved or disposed off.</P>
<P>The committee think it a duty incumbent on them, to add that in the performance of this service, the af∣fectionate and tender expressions of the patients, and the kind manner in which the separation between them and the worthy matron and faithful attendants took place, affords the strongest reason to conclude, that the arduous undertaking hath been performed with every attention and tenderness, which the nature of the afflicting calamity would permit; and that the sur∣vivors will long remember, with grateful sentiments, the benefits which they have derived from an institu∣tion, supported by the liberal donations of sympathi∣sing fellow citizens, in this and neigbouring States.</P>

<Q><PB N="185" REF="027501_0186_0FD49C79D5CE8CD0"/>
<TEXT>
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="report">
<P>HAVING been appointed a Committee on the 14th of September last, at a meeting of the citi∣zens, called by the Mayor, for the purpose of alle∣viating the sufferings of our fellow-citizens, who were labouring under the afflicting sickness, which then prevailed; we have requested your attendance, in or∣der briefly to report to you our proceedings; referring you for more particular information to our minutes, which are in the press, and to our accounts, now pro∣duced for your inspection.</P>
<P>Upon entering on the duties of our appointment, we found many families of the poor struggling under disease and want. And that the house of William Hamilton, at Bush-Hill, which had been taken possessi∣on of, and converted into an hospital, for their accom∣modation, contained several sick persons in a deplora∣ble situation. Two of our members offering their ser∣vices to superintend that institution, they were appoint∣ed managers thereof, and by their exertion and attention it was conducted with order and regularity. About one thousand persons were removed to it (in carriages provided for the purpose) and supplied with every re∣quisite, to render them comfortable, that the exi∣gency of the times and our situation would admit of.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the great mortality which prevail∣ed there, we think ourselves warranted in the belief, that much distress was prevented and the sufferings of many greatly alleviated. We cannot with propriety omit informing you, that the tenderness and care ex∣ercised by Mary Savill (the matron of the hospital) to the sick, were such as intitles her to your generous no∣tice.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="027501_0187_0FD49C42B48E0678"/>
The extreme distress to which many families were reduced rendering it impossible for them to procure the interment of their deceased connections, it became one of our most pressing duties to provide for the bu∣rial of such persons, and therefore we procured coffins and carriages, and employed suitable persons to attend to this mournful part of the service.</P>
<P>In the progress of the disease, many children were bereft of their parents, and the general distress pre∣venting individuals from attending to their exposed si∣tuations, we were impelled to take charge of such or∣phans, and of course it became necessary to provide a a suitable house, with a matron and attendants and a number of wet nurses This was done and the whole placed under the direction of four of our members especi∣ally appointed for that purpose: of one hundred and ninety-two of these helpless innocents, who came un∣der our care, ninety-four have been reclaimed by their friends, twenty seven have died, and seventy-one yet remain; on whose behalf we have applied to the Legis∣lature, but as they have not come to a determination on our application, we therefore earnestly recommend these orphans to your immediate attention.</P>
<P>The calamitous state of the city caused an universal stagnation of business and increased the number of the indigent so much, that in order to obtain a knowledge of their real situation and guard against imposition, in relieving their wants, we found it necessary to call for assistance; when a number of respectable inhabitants of the city and suburbs came forward to our aid, under the title of the Assistant Committee, who rendered very essential service by recommending suitable objects; which facilitated the distribution of money, provisions
<PB N="187" REF="027501_0188_0FD49C7B663449E8"/>
and firewood, from the 14th October to the 23d No∣vember, to upwards of one thousand families, weekly.</P>
<P>These different operations requiring considerable funds, and the major part of the overseers of the poor, as well as most of the officers of government and police being removed; recourse was had to the president and directors of the bank of North-America, who cheer∣fully accommodated us with six thousand five hundred dollars; which we have been enabled to repay by the subsequent liberality of our fellow citizens of this and other states, whose donations to us have amounted to twenty nine thousand and eighty five dollars seventy seven cents, besides which we have received 5316 dol∣lars, 32 cents, for sundries mentioned in our accounts; which sums fall short of that expended by us, three thousand two hundred and forty five dollars twelve cents.</P>
<P>The mode of supplying this deficiency you will doubtless conceive to be a part of the business of the present meeting.</P>
<P>As no public provision is made in case we should be visited with a similar affliction (to which all great com∣mercial cities are exposed) it was deemed essential, af∣ter compensating the proprietor of Bush-Hill for the use made of his property, to secure a resort to it again, should it be found necessary, before the 25th of March, 1795; this was done and it is still in our possession—wherein are deposited such articles as remain on hand belonging to the Hospital. The appropriation of these articles is an object which will claim your attention.</P>
<P>The consideration of the propriety of establishing an Hospital in the neighbourhood of this city, for persons afflicted with infectious diseases, which at the time of our appointment was referred to us, would have claim∣ed
<PB N="188" REF="027501_0189_0FD49C4543F65FB0"/>
our more particular attention, had not the subject through the recommendation of the Governor, been taken up by the legislature.</P>
<P>We think it proper to inform you, that on the 13th day of October, a number of sick and wounded French∣men arrived here, on board the ship Citizen of Mars<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es from the hospital of Cape Francois; which alarm∣ing the inhabitants, we at the pressing solicitation of the secretary of the French legation, and to dispel the public fears, admitted these diseased strangers into part of the buildings at Bush-Hill, the expences which oc∣curred, have been reimbursed.</P>
<P>Although we have to lament the loss of Andrew Adgate, Jonathan D. Sergeant, Joseph Inskeep and Daniel Offley, four of our member<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, who faithful to the trust reposed in them, perseveringly discharged, with the most benevolent attention, its various duties, until dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> put a period to their exertions, and they fell themselves under the blow they were warding o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> from other<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> yet while we look back with mournful regret to the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss of our companions, gratitude to the supreme disposer of events requires our acknowledg∣ment of his interposition in the preservation of our own lives, and those of so many of our fellow citizens.</P>
