<HEAD>TO THE CHRISTIAN Reader.</HEAD>
<P>THE False Narrations, and Odi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us Repre∣sentations, contained in that Scandalous Book, written by <HI>Robert Calf,</HI> has made our worthy Pastors Obnoxious (for ought we know) to hard Cen∣sures, among an unguided multitude. We have little hopes of convicting any, who are so full fraught∣ed with the Ʋenome of that Book, as that no Evi∣dence will avail, but in spite of all that is hitherto known, will still retain a Belief to the contrary: yet this we hope, that those who are not such grand Ene∣mies to Truth, may hereby be satisfyed in those things which they have hitherto but doubted of; for want of which knowledge, they have been unable to defend those Faithful Servants of Christ. That is the End of this Book; That those who are well wishers to the Eminent Servants of Christ, and His Peo∣ple, may be able to oppose all gainsayers, who by their Reproaches, and Slanders, go about to render them Odious to the world; whereby they will be deprived of all their desired Opportunities to Serve God &amp; his Faithful People. If this shall help any therein, we
<PB REF="000975_0003_0FAE8C6AC1618BD0"/>
shall obtain our desires, and have no cause to Re∣pent that ever we spent our Time and Cost about it; But Rejoyce that ever we undertook this Task. Now that there may be no more Slandering and Reviling, and Reproaching one another, but that we may be all bound in the Bands of Ʋnity, Sing∣ing the Song of the Glorious Angels above; <HI>Glory to God in the Highest, on Earth Peace, Good Will towards men:</HI> Is the hearty Desire and Prayer of those, who in the Name, at the Desire, and with the Consent, of many others, have put this Book into your Hands.</P>

<P><HI>NEW-ENGLAND</HI> was once a plaee, in which the Feet of them that brought the Good Tidings of the Gospel were beautiful. But there is now sprung up a Number, who seem to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of another Spirit: No wonder then if those who are Faithful to Christ and His Interest, are Reproached and Maligned by them that serve His greatest Enemy. It is an awful Symptom, of some sad thing near unto <HI>The Churches,</HI> when the most Faithful, and Painful I abourers among us <HI>in them,</HI> are bemired and bespattered by Ungodly men. But that God who said, <HI>Blessed are ye when men Revile you, and Persecute you, and speak all manner of Evil of you, falsely for my sake</HI>; will reward them.</P>
<P>There is according to our esteem of it, a Libellous Book lately come unto this Countrey, which Book may truely be called, <HI>A Fire-brand thrown by a Mad-man</HI>; which is writ (with what help we know not) by one <HI>Robert Calef,</HI> who presumes to call himself <HI>Merchant of Boston</HI>; but we wish, <HI>Better</HI> Wares were vended, by
<PB N="6" REF="000975_0005_0FAE8C6C2B4D1158"/>
this <HI>Merchant.</HI> The Book is full as is thought by Good men, of Scurrilous Reflections on the <HI>Government,</HI> as well as the <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Countrey.</P>
<P>And First, for the <HI>Government</HI>; the tenden∣cy of the Book is to perswade the People, that the <HI>Judges</HI> of the Land; are the Unjustest, Cruellest and most Blood-thirsty men; <HI>Our Wise men</HI> (sayes he) <HI>becoming Fools.</HI> What was done by them in the dark time of our Troubles from the <HI>Invisible World,</HI> all Honest men believe, they did in Conscience of the <HI>Oath</HI> of God upon them, and they followed unto the best of their Understanding, as we are in∣formed, the Precedents of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> and <HI>other Nations,</HI> on such a Dark and Doleful occasion. When they found the matter carried beyond the reach of <HI>Mortals,</HI> they stopt; and the Honourable Lieutenant Governour, Coun∣cil and Assembly of the Province, in a Publick Proclamation for a <HI>Fast</HI>; called for the Prayers of the Countrey, <HI>That whatsoever mistakes on either hand have been fallen into, referring to the late Troubles raised among us by</HI> Satan, <HI>and his Instruments, through the awful Judgments of God, he would Humble us therefore, and Pardon us.</HI> After that those our Honourable Judges (fearing least wrong steps might have been taken) had thus set apart a <HI>Day</HI> for solemn Humiliation before the Lord, humbly Implo∣ring
<PB N="7" REF="000975_0006_0FAE8C6F8EE52410"/>
His Pardon for what might have been done amiss; for him to <HI>Repeat that matter,</HI> and set it out with imperfect Relations and odious Aggravations, thereby intending to ren∣der the Land, and the Judges obnoxious (tho' all the Learning that he and wiser men than he, pretends unto, is insufficient to dive to the Bottom of the matter;) and for him to speak as he does of those Honourable Persons, (as you will find in his praeface,) <HI>as men obstinate in an Error, and involved in the guilt of the Blood shed by Pagans and Papists before them:</HI> what shall we think of it, but that 'tis inhumane, and fit for none but a <HI>Servant</HI> of the worst Master? One would have thought, that the <HI>Fear of God</HI> (if he has any) should have darted that Scripture into his mind, (while compiling such a Pam∣phlet) Exod. 22.28. <HI>Thou shalt not speak Evil of the Ruler of thy People.</HI></P>
<P>But then, for the <HI>Ministry</HI>; we do admire with what face he dares so wilfully to Reproach, and Libel the Servants of Christ? How dares he affirm (as p. the last, of his preface) <HI>That the Accusations from the Spectral sight, being the chief Evidence against those that Suffered, were up∣held both by Magistrates and Ministers, so long as they apprehended themselves in no danger; and then, though they could Defend neither the Doctrine for the Practice, yet none of them have in such a Publick manner, as the Case requires Testified a∣gainst
<PB N="8" REF="000975_0007_0FAE8C706F9A4B68"/>
either.</HI> 'Tis well known by those who have ever read over the <HI>Wonders of the Invi∣sible World, Enchantments Encountred,</HI> p. 6. that the Judgment of the Ministers was, <HI>That the Daemons might impose the Shapes of Innocent per∣sons in their Spectral Exhibitions.</HI> And it was the advice of the Elders to the Governour and Council, in the beginning of the <HI>Salem</HI> Trou∣bles, Exprest in such words as those, <HI>Ench. Enc.</HI> p. 15. <HI>That Presumptions whereupon persons may be Committed, and much more Convictions where∣upon persons may be Condemned as guilty of Witch∣crafts, ought certainly to be more Considerable, than barely the Accused persons being Represented by a Spectre, unto the afflicted, nor are alterations in the sufferers by a Look, or a Touch of the Accused, to be esteemed an Infallible evidence of Guilt, but frequently liable to be abused by the Devils Leger∣demains.</HI> And a Book Composed by the Re∣verend Praesident of the Colledge, was after∣wards Published for that purpose, whereunto, Fourteen Reverend Ministers set their hands. But this is not all, for the whole Body of the Ministers in the Countrey are charged, as <HI>Guil∣ty of Sacriledge in the highest Degree, if not Direct Blasphemy, and Diabolical Wickedness.</HI> [p. 155.] Elsewhere he vilely endeavours, to charge them with an Opinion, <HI>That there are more Almighties than one, and that Satan is Almighty, and can do what he pleases,</HI> He insinuates, that our
<PB N="9" REF="000975_0008_0FAE8C71566225F8"/>
Reverend Ministers make the Devil an <HI>Indepen∣dent Being,</HI> and (as he sayes) <HI>Consequently a God.</HI> An abominable Charge! Certainly he was altogether unmindful of that Scripture, Deut. 33.11. <HI>Of Levi, he said, Lord smite thro' the Loins of them that rise up against him.</HI> That there should be any in the midst of us, that by published Libels go about thus to render the worthy Pastors of the Flocks of Christ odious to them, is matter of Grief unto <HI>us</HI>; and no doubt but 'tis so to <HI>all Good men.</HI> It was highly rejoyc∣ing to us, when we heard that our <HI>Book-sellers</HI> were so well acquainted with the Integrity of our Pastors, as not one of them would admit of any of those <HI>Libels</HI> to be vended in their shops. And it was our Hope that a <HI>further Testimony</HI> would have been born by others against such pernicious attempts to blow up the Religion of God among us. But the doing of a piece of Justice to our own Reverend &amp; Faithful Pastors, whom Satan hath singled out (by this Instru∣ment) <HI>above others</HI> to spit his Venome upon, is that which in a more especial manner has obliged us thus to appaer Publickly. These wor∣thy persons are the main <HI>Butts</HI> set up for the Devil to shoot his <HI>Arrows</HI> at, especially now by a Volumn consisting of most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ving abuses, and aspersions. We have no need to wonder at their not taking the pains to vindicate them∣selves from these Injuries, or give any other

And we have good Grounds to hope, that the hearts of all Sincere Christians will rejoyce to see any people so ready to Vindicate their Inju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d Pastors. But we have grounds to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ar, lest the Grand Enemy of mankind should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our Childrens Conversion to God, and ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ing Salvation by the painful endeavours of our Faithful Teachers; and lest the Holy and useful Books, Composed by their Elaborate

<P>Is there any among the Children of men, that have Sold themselves to serve the Interest of Satan to purpose? Let it be their Study by their <HI>Slanders</HI> to Blast the Reputation of those, in whom the Honour of God, and of His Re∣ligion, and the Salvation of Souls is much concerned.

<PB N="12" REF="000975_0011_0FAE8C746C37FDF8"/>
in <HI>England,</HI> as Agent on the behalf of this Colony: in p. 95. 'tis said, <HI>The Agents did not all of them Act according to the Mind and Interest of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se that impowred them, which is manifest by their not Acting joyntly in what they did.</HI> Herein he not only Reflects upon that well known, and eminent Servant of Christ, and His People, but also upon Sir <HI>Henry Ashurst,</HI> a worthy Gentleman, who did (as we are well assured) with all the care and pains imaginable, seek the Good of <HI>New-Eng∣land,</HI> and thereby has laid us under endless obligations of Gratitude. We hope, the Friends of <HI>New-England,</HI> will not think that all per∣sons will treat them so ill, as this man endea∣vours to do. 'Tis as certain to us, as any such things can be, that neither Sir <HI>Henry</HI> nor Mr. <HI>Mather,</HI> Acted in the Publick Affairs of this Colony, any otherwise then accord∣ing to the best advice of the best and wisest Friends to <HI>New-England,</HI> then residing in <HI>London,</HI> with whom they alwayes consulted. But if Mr, <HI>Mather</HI>'s words are not to be taken in his own case, then take the Testimony of the Reverend Mr. <HI>Mead,</HI> in a Letter to a Gentle∣man in <HI>Boston,</HI> well known to us, which runs thus,</P>
<P><HI>Mr.</HI> Mather <HI>has deserved highly of</HI> New-England, <HI>for the unfainting Diligence, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>de∣fat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gable Endeavours, he has shewed in his Agen∣cy
<PB N="13" REF="000975_0012_0FAE8C752A0B2730"/>
for that people, and while some with you may perhaps wonder that he has obtained no more, we here, who have the advantage of a better Prospect, wonder that he hath done so much. And if men reward not his great Work, and Labour of Love, I am sure God will. What he has done has not been without the Counsel and Advice of the best Friends, that Countrey has in this, both Parliament men, Lawyers, and Ministers. And to be thankful for what you have for the present, is the way to get what you want hereafter.</HI> Thus writes that Eminent person, who is now gone to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> better World. To Confirm this, we have in our hands a Printed Extract of a Letter from the Right Worshipful Sir <HI>Henry Ashurst,</HI> to the General Assembly in <HI>Boston,</HI> whose words are;</P>

<P>The restoring your <HI>Charter,</HI> upon which the Security and Publick Good of your Co∣lony depends, we Congratulate with as joyful Affections, as with tender Resentments we Condoled the deprivation of it. When your
<PB N="15" REF="000975_0014_0FAE8C789A34E490"/>
and our State was in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ppearance desolate be∣yond humane Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l and Power to redress, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen Deliverance c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me from above: and in our deep Darkness, the Day-spring from an High visited us. We most humbly Ad∣mire and Adore the Glorious Author of that Blessed work: And we cannot but pay our most Grateful Respects, and Dutiful Sub∣jection to His Chosen Servant, our Soveraign, the happy Instrument of it. All the Colours of Language are not lively and grateful enough to express His benefits to us. He has the honour of Establishing our Religion at home, and gives us hopes of Restoring it abroad, in places from whence it has been Unrighteously and Cruelly expelled.</P>
<P>Some among you may wonder there has been so long delay before your <HI>Charter</HI> was smi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ht, but if you consider the Torrent of affairs in the Court after the Late Revolu∣tion, it will lessen the wonder.</P>
<P>The Truth is, your affairs were so Difficult and Thorny, that the rare union of the Wisdom of the <HI>Serpent,</HI> and the Innocence of the <HI>Dove,</HI> was requisite in the Commis∣sioners managing of it. A peremptory Re∣fus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of any Charter, but of an uniform Tenor with the first, had been like too strong a Medicine, that E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sperates the Disease in∣stead of Curing it. In affairs of great im∣portance,
<PB N="16" REF="000975_0015_0FAE8C78EDF2B9D0"/>
'tis wisdom maturely to delibe∣rate, and Consider conditional events, and by the foresight of Inconveniencies that will otherwise follow, to accept of such things as are best with respect to their Circumstances.</P>
<P>We must therefore give this true Testi∣mony of our much Esteemed and Beloved Brother, Mr. <HI>Increase Mather,</HI> That with in∣violate Integrity, excellent Prudence, and unfainting Diligence, he hath managed the great business committed to his Trust. As he is instructed in the School of Heaven, to Minister in the affairs of the Soul, so he is furnished with a Talent to transact affairs of State. His proceedings have been with that Caution and Circumspection, as is cor∣respondent to the weight of his Commission; he with Courage, and Constancy has pursued the noble scope of his employment, and un∣derstanding the true moment of things, has preferred the Fablick Good to the vain con∣ceits of some, that more might have been ob∣tained if peremptorily insisted on; Considering open opposition and secret arts that have been used to frustrate the best endeavours for the Interest of <HI>New-England,</HI> the happy issue of these things is superiour to our Expectations. Your present Charter secures Liberty and Pro∣perty, the fairest flowers of the Civil State:
<PB N="17" REF="000975_0016_0FAE8C79BA0656F0"/>
and which is incomparably more valuable, it secures the enjoyment of the Blessed Gospel in its purity &amp; freedome. Altho' there is a restraint of your power in some things that were granted in the former Charter, yet there are more ample Priviledges in other things that may be of perpetual advantage to the Co∣lony.</P>
<P>We doubt not but your Faithfull Agent will receive a Gracious reward above: And we hope his successfull Service will be wel∣comed with your entire approbation, &amp; grate∣ful acceptance. We now with ardent af∣fections recommend our Dear Brother to the Divine mercy, that thro' such dangerous Seas he may safely arrive at his desired place: And we earnestly pray, that the Blessings of Hea∣ven may be alwayes upon your Colony; that by the Light and Power of the Gospel, the Prince of Darkness may be expelled from his ancient Dominions; and the Kingdome of our Saviour, may be Established &amp; Enlarged, by the Accession of the American Heathen to be His Inheritance.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Now if Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> in his Negotiation for his Countrey, acted Faithfully according to his judgement, and if the wisest Friends <HI>New-Eng∣land</HI> had in <HI>England</HI> thought, as he did, (as is abundantly attested by persons of great Emi∣nency) why has this Impertinent man im∣peached his Fidelity?</P>
<P>Is it possible that a man should have more and greater Testimonies to the Faithful dis∣charge of his Duty in seeking the Good of this Countrey, to the utmost of his ability? <HI>Robert Calef</HI> dares not say here is not suffici∣ent Witnesses. No, but this he does. He gives a <HI>Kick</HI> at these great men: for he sayes [p. 150.] <HI>Mr.</HI> Mather <HI>got several Non-con∣formist Ministers to give him a Testimonial, or Letters of Commendation for his great service.</HI> What great Folly is it to cast such Reflections and Contumelies? See both the <HI>Folly</HI> &amp; <HI>Falshood</HI> of it. What if Mr <HI>Mather</HI> had done so? where would have been the damage of it? Is not he guilty of great <HI>Folly,</HI> to think that a Number of as Godly, Discreet, and Excellent
<PB N="19" REF="000975_0018_0FAE8C7B2C152BE8"/>
persons as any in the City of <HI>London,</HI> would set their Hands to they knew not what, and so positively assert a thing they were ignorant of? However, 'tis altogether False; Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> (as he has affirmed to us never had such a thought come into his mind, nor it may be never would, as to have asked such Testimoni∣als, had not a person of Quality that was his particular Friend, desired that Dr. <HI>Bates,</HI> might draw up such a Letter and that <HI>great Doctor,</HI> (when he had well weighed &amp; considered our Charter) most readily did it. And the Doctor presented this Letter thus drawn up by himself, to such Ministers as he thought fit, and <HI>Ten</HI> of them subscribed it, before ever Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> spoke a word to them about it. But who shall be Judge, <HI>whether the Reverend</HI> Increase Mather <HI>Faithfully served the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nterest of his Countrey or no?</HI> Shall this <HI>Calf</HI> be Judge, or the <HI>People</HI> them∣selves? We think it most fitting the <HI>People</HI> should be Judge; and they shall be so. When the greatest General Court that ever was in <HI>New-England,</HI> Assembled at <HI>Boston</HI> in the year 1692. Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> (as he informs us) waited on <HI>them</HI> with the <HI>Instructions</HI> which were sent to him at <HI>London</HI> as <HI>Agent</HI> of the <HI>Colony</HI>; and on <HI>June</HI> the 9th. every one of the <HI>Instructions</HI> were read by him, before the whole <HI>Assembly</HI>; where he declared to their satisfaction, how to the utmost of his power, he had punctually ob∣served
<PB N="20" REF="000975_0019_0FAE8C7D4E9DFD38"/>
every one of them. And on <HI>June</HI> 24th. Mr. <HI>Bond</HI> then Speaker of the <HI>Representatives,</HI> did in the Name of the whole <HI>House,</HI> return him hearty Thanks, for his Unwearied and Faith∣ful endeavours to serve his Countrey: he also added, that they were sensible, it was their Duty to reward those his Faithful endeavours, but by reason of the Expensive War they then Laboured under, they could not perform what they were willing to do on that account; Whereupon, Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> (using the words of the Apostle,) said, <HI>He sought not theirs but them,</HI> in what he had endeavoured and performed for them: and added, <HI>He was willing to wait for a Recompence in another World.</HI> As for <HI>Ro∣bert Calfs</HI> saying, The <HI>Agents</HI> could not all act for the Interest of them that employed them, because <HI>they did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Act joyntly</HI>; It is both Foolish and False. Might they not all Act for the same <HI>Good End,</HI> and yet have their various thoughts abouts the <HI>Best Means</HI> to be used for it? Might they not all of them to the utmost of their power, Labour to obtain the <HI>Old Charter,</HI> and all the priviledges con∣tained in it, with additional ones, and yet when they saw their hopes frustrated, differ in their apprehensions, what was best now to be done? Might not the want of certain Great Priviledges (of the <HI>Old Charter</HI> in the <HI>New One</HI>) cause some of them to think, it best
<PB N="21" REF="000975_0020_0FAE8C7E95757438"/>
to take nothing at all, and yet others think it better taking up with <HI>Hal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oaf than no Bread,</HI> and so get what possibly they could ob∣tain for the present, and wait the issue of Providence for the obtaining of more: and yet all of them sincerely and strenuously press after the best Good and Interes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of them that impowred them? All the Agents are most worthy Persons, and every one of them hath deserved great acknowledgments from this Province, on account of their Faithful En∣deavours to Serve the Publick Interest.</P>
<P>It is not worth our while to take notice of every thing this <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al</HI> sayes, 'tis often so im∣pertinent; However, we will say lay open one thing more. He sayes, [p. 147.] that Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> procured a Charter for Sir <HI>William</HI> to be Governour, and <HI>himself <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stablished Praesident of the Colledge.</HI> Can there be greater Nonsence mixed with Malice! How could this be, when Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> had been Praesident of the Colledge <HI>Ten</HI> Years before Sir <HI>William</HI> came to be Go∣vernour? And it is well known that the Corporation, and all persons concerned in the Colledge, and the whole General Court did urge Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> to accept of the Praesident∣ship of the Colledge <HI>Twenty</HI> Years ago; and though for diverse years he acted as Praesident, yet he refused to be Established in the place he
<PB N="22" REF="000975_0021_0FAE8C7FA9E4BF28"/>
then managed, but was active in causing a∣nother to be Chosen who Resided there about a Year, and then went to the Heavenly World. After that, the General Court &amp; Corporation did again apply themselves to him, thinking none so fit to undertake the Care and Inspec∣tion of that Society, on which depends the well-being of <HI>New-England,</HI> as HE was, which accordingly he undertook in the Year 1684. and ever since he has had that Charge im∣posed on him, though there are Witnesses enough, he hath Frequently and Earnestly de∣sired to be eased thereof. Spit on, <HI>Calf</HI>; thou shalt be but like the <HI>Viper</HI> on <HI>Pauls</HI> hand, easily shaken off, and without any damage to the Servant of the Lord. What more has he to say? Why this, That Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> should not have accepted the Charter, but (<HI>p.</HI> 150) <HI>have stay∣ed until His Majesties return from Flanders.</HI> Up∣on this Article we enquired of the Reverend Mr. <HI>Mather,</HI> concerning that matter, and re∣ceived from him under his hand as followeth;</P>
<LETTER>
<P>When the <HI>King</HI> was pleased to give a posi∣tive Command that the <HI>Charter</HI> of <HI>New-England</HI> should be dispatched, it was not for the <HI>Agents</HI> to say, it shall not be so. True it is, that <HI>all the Agents</HI> when they saw what <HI>Minute</HI> would be inserted in the <HI>Charter,</HI> were desirous of a delay, until the <HI>Kings</HI> hap∣py
<PB N="23" REF="000975_0022_0FAE8C8084182FF0"/>
return to <HI>England.</HI> And I may without vanity say, no man laboured to have it so, more then my self. I prayed Arch-Bishop <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lotson</HI> to intercede with the <HI>Queen</HI> for this favour to us, who at my request did so. Moreover, I drew up several Reasons against that which in the <HI>Minutes</HI> of the <HI>New-Charter</HI> is most grievous to us; which were by Sir <HI>Henry Ashurst,</HI> and my self, delivered to His Majesties Attourney General, on <HI>July,</HI> 24. 1691. and which I did also send to my Lord <HI>Sidney,</HI> one of His Ma∣jesties principal Secretaries of State, then with the <HI>King</HI> in <HI>Flanders.</HI> I now thought that there would be no further proceedings about the <HI>Charter</HI> for <HI>New-England</HI> before His <HI>Majesties</HI> return. <HI>Physicians</HI> advised me to go into the <HI>Countrey</HI> and use the Mineral wa∣ters for the recovery of my impaired Health. Before I had been there <HI>Three weeks,</HI> I was to my surprize sent for to <HI>London,</HI> with infor∣mation, that the <HI>King</HI> had signified His Roy∣al Pleasure to the Earle of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> that there should be a procedure with a <HI>Charter</HI> for the <HI>Massachusetts Colony,</HI> according to the <HI>Minutes</HI> that the Lords of the <HI>Committee</HI> for <HI>Plantations</HI> had agreed to, notwithstanding the Objections of the <HI>Agents</HI> to the Con∣trary. A certain Person then in the world, gave out that I was imposed on, and made to believe that such a Signification of His
<PB N="24" REF="000975_0023_0FAE8C81444DF590"/>
<HI>Majesties</HI> Pleasure was sent to the Secretary of State, when there was no such thing. I therefore prayed the Earle of <HI>Nottingham</HI> (who was then the principal Secretary of State) to be so kind, as to order his <HI>Clerk</HI> to give me a Copy of what the <HI>King</HI> had or∣dered should be done, which his <HI>Lordship</HI> was pleased to gratify me in, and I still have the Original Copy written with the hand of his Lordships Clerk, by me. It is in these words.</P>

<P><PB N="25" REF="000975_0024_0FAE8C81F7D770D0"/>Now let the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orld Judge, yea and <HI>Robert Calef</HI>'s Conscience (if it be not Seared) judge, whether he has done well to endeavour to Blemish my Reputation in Print, by insinu∣ating as if I had done amiss, in not stopping the proceedings in the Charter for this <HI>Province,</HI> when it was not in my power to do it. Yet nevertheless, after this I obtained those clauses in the <HI>Charter,</HI> which Confirm all donations to Schools of Learning, and all Grants of Lands, by former General Courts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to be inserted in the present Charter: for which better men than <HI>Robert Calef</HI> are of Opinion, that the <HI>Countrey</HI> owes me Thanks. I shall further add, that after the <HI>Charter</HI> was finished, several Right▪ Honourable Persons said to me, they were glad of what was gain∣ed, and that they could assure me, that if the proceedings had been delayed, until the Kings return, more would not have been obtained.</P>
<P>I hear that some of <HI>Robert Calefs</HI> Abettors whisper, that the Reverend Ministers at <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> Repented of their writing such a Letter of Attestation to my Fidelity, and that in a <HI>Fast,</HI> they bewailed their Sin in that matter▪ It must needs be <HI>Malice</HI> that has invented such a Ridiculous Story. Had it been <HI>True,</HI> it is very <HI>Strange</HI> that none of them would
<PB N="26" REF="000975_0025_0FAE8C82AA40A680"/>
signify it to me, but the contrary. Part of this, was whispered Seven Years ago, when in Print I Charged the Authors of that re∣port, to be <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gers of Lies.</HI> It was particu∣larly whispered, that the Reverend Mr. <HI>Quick</HI> Repented of his Subscribing the Letter: Whereupon, I wrote to him concerning it, and Mr. <HI>Quick</HI> returned an Answer in these words.</P>
<LETTER>
<P><HI>You write of some persons, who have Reported my Repentance for Subscribing your Attestation. Sir, I have not the Command of other mens Tongues. As for</HI> W. <HI>he is a man to whom I am an utter Stranger, having never heard his Name before I read it in your Letter.</HI> Another, <HI>and I, had some Discourse about you. The Sum of my Answer to them was this, I knew you to be a Learned and Prudent man, and believed you to be one Fearing God, and therefore durst not Credit what any one should say of you in your Absence. And I pray you let not other mens Reports of me, at so great a distance be Credited against me. I Subscribed the Letter Voluntrrily, and to the best of my Ʋnderstanding Judiciously, and Conscientiously; as I Believe did all those other Reverend Ministers, who gave you their Hands: and I know nothing to the con∣trary, why I should not joyn in such Good Company.</HI></P>
</LETTER>
<P>Thus writes the Reverend Mr. <HI>Quick.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="000975_0026_0FAE8D62221ACA08"/>Moreover, when the Famous Dr <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y</HI> was informed, that some Reported as if he Repented of his having <HI>Set</HI> his Hand to that Letter, he replyed, with some warmth of Spirit; <HI>If there be any need of it, I will Set both my Hands to it: For Mr.</HI> Mather <HI>did well, when he could not possibly obtain more for his Countrey, to take up with the best he could get.</HI></P>
<P>I am also told, that there are some men, who formerly had no great kindness for <HI>Robert Calef,</HI> but are now, because of his reviling me and my Son, (which not a little grati∣tifies the <HI>Enemies</HI> to the Holy Churches of <HI>New-England</HI>) become his great <HI>Friends</HI>; and that these complain, that I spent the Countrey a great deal of Money during my <HI>Agency</HI> in their behalf. These little men know not what it is to attend in the Courts of Kings, for Four Years together: if they did, they would not make that objecton. And sure I am, that when I did at the desire of many principal persons in the Countrey, un∣dertake a Voyage for <HI>England</HI> in <HI>April</HI> 1688. People in this Province, would gladly have given <HI>Ten times</HI> more then what I Expended in their Service, on condition they might have Restored and Confirmed to them, what now they enjoy: yea, if it had been but in

<HI>one Article</HI> of it. But besides this, I may truely affirm that in effect, I served the Countrey on <HI>Free Cost.</HI> For I never demand∣ed the least Farthing as a recompence, for the Time I spent in attending on their Affairs, but instead thereof, I procured in <HI>Donations</HI> for the Publick, besides the Priviledges of the Charter it self, which, though not so great as I would have had, &amp; as I would gladly have parted with all I have in this world to have purchased, are greater than any other Plantations besides <HI>New-England</HI> en∣joyes: I say, besides these things, I pro∣cured in <HI>Donations</HI> to the Province and the Colledge,) at least <HI>Nine Hundred Pounds</HI> more then all the Expences of my Agency came to. This being plain <HI>matter of Fact,</HI> which the whole <HI>General Assembly</HI> once had laid before them, I suppose all Reasonable men, will own, That Reproaches cast on me, for my <HI>Expensiveness</HI> in the Publick Service, are most Ungrateful and Unworthy.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Thus hath he answered our Request unto him; &amp; now Judge, whether Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> were to blame in these matters. The Author of the Scurrilous Book now need not to wonder, that Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> should Print a <HI>Brief Nar∣rative of his Negotiation in</HI> England: He had before sent a written Copy thereof to <HI>New-England,</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="000975_0028_0FAE8D62F2348A00"/>
which was read in the General Court, (as we are informed) unto their great Satis∣faction. Yet he did not without grounds Con∣jecture, there might be other persons in the world, of the same Kidney with this <HI>Calf</HI>; and therefore, that so (especially in case of his own Mortallity at Sea) his Friends might do him Justice, it was great Prudence in him to Print a convenient Number of Copies of the said <HI>Narrative.</HI> The <HI>Adversary,</HI> on this occa∣sion goes on to fling at Mr. <HI>Mather.</HI> A Let∣ter he sent to one in <HI>England,</HI> at the same time with himself, who formerly belonged to the <HI>North-Church</HI> in <HI>Boston,</HI> which Letter [he sayes] <HI>some call a Bull.</HI> But what matters it, if they call it so, and a <HI>Calf</HI> too? Since that, the per∣son he mentions is returned to <HI>New-England,</HI> and he did acknowledge his Error before Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> and one of the <HI>Deacons</HI> of the <HI>North-Church.</HI> Whereupon Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> did as be∣came a Disciple of Christ, Forgive him, and declared himself Reconciled unto him. Doubt∣less this <HI>Weaver</HI> wants work, or he would not have troubled the world with such Trifles. And now, for a closure, sayes he, (p. 151.) <HI>that Mr.</HI> Mather <HI>deserves as much Thanks, as Dr.</HI> Sharp <HI>did when sent by the Presbytery of</HI> Scotland, <HI>to procure the Settlement of their Kirk, &amp;c.</HI> who (by what we have heard of that story) to get him∣self made a Bishop, did what he could to undermine the Presbyterian Government▪
<PB N="30" REF="000975_0029_0FAE8D63BACA5E88"/>
Certainly, <HI>Satan himself</HI> could not but blush to say, that ever Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> went to Destroy the Government of <HI>New-England,</HI> either as to their Civil or Ecclesiastical Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>itution. <HI>Ro∣bert Calef himself,</HI> cannot but say, (p. 151.) <HI>That the present</HI> Charter <HI>of</HI> New-England <HI>is true∣ly Valuable, as containing in it peculiar Privi∣ledges, which abundantly engage this People to pay the Tribute of Thankfulness to His Majesty.</HI> With what face then can he insinuate that no Thanks are due to the Instruments of obtain∣ing such a <HI>Valuable Charter,</HI> and so many <HI>pe∣culiar Priviledges</HI>? Surely he was besides him∣self, when he wrote such things as these. Is it not well known, that when our former <HI>Charter</HI> was <HI>Quo Warranto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d,</HI> in the Reign of K. <HI>Charles</HI> II. then at the request of the <HI>Select-men</HI> in <HI>Boston,</HI> Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> did appear at a Town-Meeting (though he does not use to be at such Meetings,) and did Encourage and Ex∣cite them, to stand by their <HI>Charter-Priviledges,</HI> and not to give away what was the <HI>Inheritance of their Fathers.</HI> He could not but be sensible, that by appearing so openly in such a cause, he ventured very far, but being satisfied that he was called of God to do what he did, he went to it with a Chearful Heart. Where∣upon (as we have heard, &amp; no doubt it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> true) complaints were entred against him in that Kings Court, for his withstanding their de∣signs.
<PB N="31" REF="000975_0030_0FAE8D64D1701898"/>
And since the Condemnation of that <HI>Charter,</HI> has he not laboured with might and main, that the <HI>Judgment</HI> issued against it might be reversed? Did not his earnest Endeavours, with leading <HI>Parliament-men,</HI> procure the pas∣sing of a <HI>Vote</HI> in the <HI>House of Commons,</HI> decla∣ring that the taking away of the Charter of <HI>New-England,</HI> was <HI>Illegal and a Grievance?</HI> Whereupon, a Bill was passed in the <HI>House for the Restauration of it</HI>? When he had the Honour to speak to the <HI>King,</HI> was it not his Humble Request to His <HI>Majesty,</HI> that all the Charter-priviledges of <HI>New-England,</HI> might be Restored to them? Did he not Humbly Peti∣tion the <HI>Queens</HI> Majesty, to intercede with the <HI>King</HI> for His Royal Favour herein, who was most Graciously pleased to assure him, that Her Majesty would do so? These things are no secrets, every body has opportunity to know the Truth of them. We are well assu∣red that Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> never gave away any Priviledges of the Countrey, but instead of that, was an happy Instrument of regaining some very Great Priviledges, which were unjustly taken from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: And as in the Prose∣cution thereof, he did (as the Honourable Sir <HI>Henry Ashurst</HI> tells the Assembly) impair his <HI>Health,</HI> so we believe he whoul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not have counted his <HI>Life</HI> Dear to him, would that have obtained what he Zealously endeavoured
<PB N="32" REF="000975_0031_0FAE8D65B621DD48"/>
for us. Is there any man that has been more Faithful to the Churches of <HI>New-Eng∣land?</HI> Has he not for these many Years, both at home and abroad, with Tongue and Pen, to his utmost, Defended these Churches, and their Government? What reason then, has this man to speak so Falsely, and Ma∣liciously, of him? But the Faithfullest Servants of Christ, must look to be Reviled and Re∣proached, for so was their MASTER before them.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<P>As it is observed, the Lord has Re∣markably joyned the two Mr. <HI>Mathers</HI> in serving His Churches, so tis observable, that the Enemy cannot but joyn them in his Ma∣lignant Calumnies and Reproaches; and it is but Justice for us, to joyn them in our Vin∣dicating of them. Our Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> the Younger, must not be troubled, if Ill-men, that Revile his most Reverend <HI>Father,</HI> shall give him a proportionable share in their ma∣lice. There are more <HI>Fiery Darts</HI> shot at this worthy Person, by the hand of <HI>Robert Calef,</HI> than at any one; but if he will do as he uses to do, his Prayer, and Faith, and Pati∣ence, and Holy Conversation, will soon quench them. However, it is our Duty to Vindicate
<PB N="33" REF="000975_0032_0FAE8D6629239DC0"/>
him, if he think it needless to Vindicate him∣self: Though indeed he has a witness for him in the Consciences of all that in the least measure <HI>K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> him. For our parts, we cannot but Bless God that ever we knew him. We shall but displease him, and it may be some will think it flattery, if we should pretend to write the Character which this worthy man deserves; those that are even <HI>his Enemies, being Judges</HI> He was Born and Bred in this Town, where he has for more than <HI>Twenty</HI> Years together, been a Publick Preacher of the Gospel. It was a comforta∣ble thing to <HI>Samuel,</HI> that he was able to say, <HI>I have walked before you, from my Childhood un∣til now</HI>;, and that he could then appeal to them, to tell how he had walked. So may Mr. <HI>Cottou Mather.</HI> And we do verily believe, there is not so much as one man, that has any knowledge of him, but what will own, that they look upon him to be a <HI>worthy Good man, a Scholar, and a Gentleman,</HI> who would not willingly write a thing that is <HI>False,</HI> or do any <HI>Ill</HI> thing upon any Terms; and that he spends his Life in Studies, that he might do Good to all sorts of men: and that he can be Courteous, and full of Kindness towards Good People, that be <HI>not</HI> of his own perswasion, as well as those that be. If we be not mis-informed, <HI>Calef</HI> himself does confess as much as this
<PB N="34" REF="000975_0033_0FAE8D68E214BF28"/>
comes to; and others that are displeased at Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> for his being so significant, in the Service of the Churches, yet when they are out of their angry fits, will confess the same.</P>
<P>As for the wrongs done by <HI>Robert Calef</HI> unto him, some of us address'd him to give us something under his own Hand, that might clear up the Truth unto the Churches. And he has favoured his Friends, with the following Letter.</P>

of Remarkable-Providences,</HI> and when he demanded and expected an Answer to his Follies, that Reverend person only said, <HI>Go tell him, That the Answer to him and his Let∣ter is in the-Twenty-sixth of the</HI> Proverbs, <HI>and the Fourth.</HI> When likewise, he sent about un∣to all the Ministers a <HI>Libellou Letter</HI> against my self, falsely Charging me with writing in a Manuscript of mine, <HI>Ten Articles</HI> (which are of his own drawing up) whereof the chief are of his <HI>own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure Invention,</HI> there was not one of all those Reverend Persons, who thought him worthy of an <HI>Answer.</HI> And now his Book is come abroad, I cannot hear (and many observe the like) of so much as one <HI>Vertuous</HI> and <HI>Sensible</HI> man, but let their opi∣nions about the <HI>Salem</HI> Troubles, be what they will, they detest it, as, a <HI>Vile Book,</HI> as being an intire <HI>Libel</HI> upon the whole <HI>Government</HI> and <HI>Ministry</HI> in the Land; yea, they think it beneath a <HI>Minister</HI> of the Gospel to bestow the Pains of an <HI>Answer</HI> upon it. The Book, serves but as an <HI>Engine,</HI> to discover (by their approbation of it,) a few persons in the Land that will distinguish themselves by an Exalted <HI>Malignity.</HI> The reason that made me unwilling to trust any of my writings in the hands of this man, was, because I <HI>saw</HI> the <HI>Weaver</HI> (though he presumes to call himself a <HI>Merchant</HI>) was a stranger to all the Rules

<P>The wrongs that he does me are <HI>Numerous,</HI> yea, <HI>Numberless</HI>; he can scarce mention me, without a <HI>Lye</HI> about me. I shall only single out a few that are more Notorious, and give you but a brief touch upon them: from <HI>them</HI> you shall Judge of the rest.</P>
<P>His first and main design, is to render me odious unto the Countrey, as being one chief <HI>Abe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tor</HI> of that opinion, That the <HI>Devils</HI> cannot afflict in the Shape of an Innocent person; and as being an <HI>Inciter</HI> of the Judges, to the Conviction of <HI>Witchcrafts</HI> upon that opinion. It is very certain, that his Conscience must needs tell him, this is a most <HI>Lying Accusation.</HI> For in my Book of <HI>Memorable Providences,</HI> which I writ before the troubles
<PB N="38" REF="000975_0037_0FAE8D6C2A1BA1F0"/>
at <HI>Salem,</HI> &amp; even <HI>before I was so fully acquaint∣en with the Wiles of Satan,</HI> for my saying of which, on a certain occasion, he flouts at me) I have a whole paragraph to caution against <HI>accounting a Bewitched persons pretending to see an A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>parition of such or such an one, an Argument of their being Naughty People.</HI> And some of the chief Ministers in this Land, favoured that Book with their <HI>Attestation,</HI> and when it was Re-printed in another Land, no less a man than Mr, <HI>Baxter,</HI> did recom∣mend it with a Praeface, as being likely to do great Service to the Christian Religion; however, my friend <HI>Calef</HI> now Derides it. And in my Book of the <HI>Invisible World,</HI> writ∣ten in the <HI>highest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orment</HI> of those Troubles, I have <HI>many Pages</HI> to diswade from reli∣ance on the <HI>Representations</HI> made unto the <HI>Afflicted,</HI> and bespeak all possible <HI>Compassion</HI> and <HI>Charity</HI> for such as had been so <HI>Repre∣sented</HI> in the Glasses of the <HI>Lying Spirit</HI>: which Book was not only ordered by the Gover∣nour, to be Published, with Terms of the highest Respect, but also was <HI>Perused</HI> and <HI>Approved</HI> by as Eminent persons as any in the Countrey, who were sufficiently dissatis∣fied at the things then a doing. Moreover, when the <HI>Ministers</HI> presented unto the <HI>Gover∣nour</HI> &amp; <HI>Council,</HI> their advice against making the <HI>Spectral Exhibitions</HI> to be so much as a <HI>Pre∣sumption</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="000975_0038_0FAE8D6F2B1AB2D0"/>
of <HI>Witchcraft,</HI> it was <HI>my</HI> poor <HI>Hand</HI> which drew up that advice, and my <HI>Heart</HI> was alwayes in it. It may be no man living ever had more people under Preternatural and a∣stonishing Circumstances, cast by the Provi∣dence of God, into his more peculiar care, then I have had; but the <HI>Name</HI> of no one Good person in the world, ever came under any <HI>Blemish,</HI> that I know of, by means of any <HI>Afflicted</HI> person, that fell under my par∣ticular care; yea, no Man, Woman or Child, ever came into any trouble, for the sake of any that were <HI>Afflicted,</HI> after I had once be∣gan to look after them. And whereas my <HI>Buffeter</HI> sayes, That His Excellency, the Go∣vernours Pardoning the Condemned persons, <HI>was not only without but also directly against his Pastors advice</HI>; All the <HI>Ministers</HI> then in the Neighbourhood, will bear witness for me, that they know this to be a <HI>Falshood.</HI> And after the Storm was raised at <HI>Salem,</HI> I did my self offer to provide Meat, Drink, and Lodging, for no less than <HI>Six</HI> of the Afflicted, that so an Experiment might be made, whether <HI>Prayer</HI> with <HI>Fasting,</HI> upon the removal of those miserables one from another, might not put a period unto the trouble then arising, without giving the <HI>Civil Authority,</HI> the trou∣ble of prosecuting the methods of the <HI>Law</HI> on that occasion. You'll say, how came it then
<PB N="40" REF="000975_0039_0FAE8D700FF4A010"/>
to pass, that many people took up another Notion of of me? Truely, <HI>Satan knows.</HI> Perhaps 'twas because I thought it my Duty alwayes to speak of the Honourable <HI>Judges</HI> with as much Honour as I could; (a Crime which I am generally Taxed for, &amp; <HI>for which I have been finely requited</HI>!) this made people, who Judge of things <HI>at a Distance,</HI> to dream that I <HI>approved</HI> of all that was done. Perhaps also my Disposition to avoid <HI>Extreams,</HI> as 'tis said, <HI>he that Feareth God shall come out of them,</HI> causeth me generally to be obnoxious unto the <HI>Violent</HI> in all parties. Or, perhaps my great Adversary alwayes had certain people▪ full of <HI>Robert Calefs</HI> Malignity, to serve him with Calumnies and Reproaches.</P>
<P>In prosecution of this design, he formed a Scandalous <HI>Libel</HI> against both my Father and my self, pretending to relate what passed in a <HI>Visit,</HI> which we made unto a poor <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r∣gumen</HI> in our Flock. Those men have put off all <HI>Humanity</HI> who do not abhor such a Villanous thing, as the Publishing of that <HI>Li∣bel</HI>: For the man had been sufficiently Cer∣tified that there were almost as many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as <HI>Lines</HI> in it. There is hardly any thing more Unpardonable in his whole Volume than these <HI>Libels,</HI> wherein he Charges us, with <HI>Speaking</HI> what we never spoke, and not only
<PB N="41" REF="000975_0040_0FAE8D710E870E20"/>
leaves out the <HI>main things</HI> that we did speak, (especially, in our Charging the poor Crea∣ture that she should rather <HI>Dye,</HI> than <HI>Accuse</HI> any people on the account of her seeing their <HI>Spectres,</HI>) but also he makes people believe, that our Intention was to procure <HI>Accusations</HI>; Yea, he tries to make them also believe some∣thing or other of us that is <HI>Base,</HI> and which he himself lately owned, that he did not in the least <HI>Believe</HI> himself. And his Printing my Letter herewithal, can only serve to shew, the <HI>Height</HI> of his own Resolved and Consum∣mate Impiety His <HI>Malice</HI> (like that of <HI>him,</HI> whose <HI>Instrument</HI> he has herein made himself) has here gone beyond his <HI>Wit.</HI> He could not easily have inserted a thing more likely to render his Book <HI>Abominable</HI> to all that have the least <HI>Christianity</HI> in them. And I believe, there is not one <HI>Christian</HI> but what would think of it with Indignation, that when Ministers of the Gospel Faithfully and Care∣fully discharge their Duty in their <HI>Visits</HI> to the Miserable in their Flocks, little <HI>Bits,</HI> and <HI>Scraps,</HI> and <HI>Shreds</HI> of their discourse (carried away perhaps by some Idle <HI>Eves droppers</HI>) should be basely tack'd together, to render them Contemptible; and many <HI>Falshoods,</HI> yea and <HI>Smutty</HI> ones too, and such as none but a <HI>Coal</HI> fetch'd from <HI>Hell</HI> could could have sug∣gested, be added for the <HI>Blackening</HI> of them.
<PB N="42" REF="000975_0041_0FAE8D712FB50EF8"/>
It were enough to procure me the Friend∣ship and esteem of any men, that have the least <HI>grain of Honesty</HI> in them, if I had it not before, to see such a <HI>Man</HI> and such a <HI>Book</HI> treat me with such <HI>Brutish Malignity.</HI> How∣ever, I am verily perswaded, that the Holy Lord, <HI>whose we are, and whom we serve,</HI> will at some time or other make this man a <HI>Ma∣gor M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssabib,</HI> for this his deliberate wickedness. I will say no more of it, but leave it in those hands, which <HI>alone</HI> will do right unto us.</P>
<P>About the <HI>Troubles</HI> which we have had from the <HI>Invisible World,</HI> I have at present nothing to offer you; but that I believe they were too <HI>Dark,</HI> and too <HI>Deep</HI> for an ordinary Comprehension: and it may be <HI>Errors</HI> on <HI>both Hands,</HI> have attended them which will never be understood until the Day, when <HI>Satan shall be Bound</HI> after another manner then he is at this Day. But for my own part, I know not that ever I have advanced any opinion in the matter of <HI>Witchcraft,</HI> but what all the Mi∣nisters of the Lord, that I know of in the world, whether <HI>English,</HI> or <HI>Scotch,</HI> or <HI>French,</HI> or <HI>Dutch</HI> (and I know many) are of the same opinion with me.</P>
<P>I'll dismiss the matter with one fresh piece of History, and leave <HI>you</HI> to Think wherefore I report it.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="000975_0042_0FAE8D7201867508"/>In the Year, 1698. my Reverend Friend Mr. <HI>Thomas Jolly,</HI> one of the most Holy Ser∣vants that the Lord Jesus Christ has upon Earth, and an Aged and Famous Minister of the Gospel, Published an Account of a certain <HI>Demoniac</HI> (one <HI>Richard Dugdale</HI>) which had late∣ly been at <HI>Surey</HI> in his Neighbourhood. In that Account, among abundance of prodigi∣ous Things which are Sworn by many Credible men, before the Lord <HI>Willoughby,</HI> and other Justices of the Peace; 'tis particularly Sworn, That the Young man, or the <HI>Demon</HI> in him, often told <HI>Secret</HI> and <HI>Future</HI> Things which no Mortal could have told, and would speak Languages which the Young man had never Learnt: That the Young man being inordi∣nately set upon <HI>Dancing,</HI> the <HI>Demon</HI> that en∣tred into him, would made him <HI>Dance</HI> on his <HI>Knees</HI> his <HI>Toes</HI> never touching the ground, for a long while together; That the Young man would be so heavy, that Six or Seven strong men could not lift him, and presently again so light, that One man with his Hand would lift him Three Quarters of a Yard high, and hold him a long while, and find him no heavier, then his Hat, or his Cane: That something like a <HI>Mouse</HI> appeared about him, and within him, running up and down under his Cloathes, and the <HI>Imp</HI> sometimes
<PB N="44" REF="000975_0043_0FAE8D72B2233C50"/>
like the Bigness of a little <HI>Dog</HI> in his Bed; and Voices were heard coming from it. These and many more Astonishing Things, conti∣nued for a Year together; and there were Thousands of <HI>Spectators,</HI> that came from all Quarters to be <HI>Witnesses</HI> of those Things. The Non-Conformist Ministers, and other Christi∣ans, in the Vicinity, (especially Mr. <HI>Jolly</HI>) kept many Dayes of <HI>Prayer</HI> with <HI>Fasting</HI> on this occasion; the Records whereof, he has Transcribed from his Diary into his Printed History. After all, the Young man was de∣livered; but as he was a very Vicious Fellow before his <HI>Possession,</HI> so he was not much mended after his Deliverance. When the Tragedy was over, one <HI>Zachary Taylor,</HI> Print∣ed a Virulent Book, (Just like our <HI>Calefs</HI>) which affirmed unto the Nation, That the the whole Business of <HI>Dugdale,</HI> was a <HI>Cheat,</HI> and a <HI>Sham,</HI> and a Combination of the <HI>Roman-Catholicks</HI> and the <HI>Non-Conformists,</HI> to put a Trick upon the Nation: and Reviled that Reverend man of God, Mr. <HI>Jolly,</HI> as Guilty of much <HI>Falsity,</HI> and <HI>Forgery,</HI> and <HI>Blasphemy,</HI> and <HI>Cursing,</HI> and as designing to <HI>hurt the Cause of Revealed Religion,</HI> and as worthy to have his <HI>Tongue bored through with an hot Iron,</HI> and other Infamous passages, that can't be Num∣bred. The Good Old Saint, published a Vindication of himself; (which is to be Sold
<PB N="45" REF="000975_0044_0FAE8D736E10D4D8"/>
at our Book-sellors) and I shall now recite but this one passage from it:</P>
<Q><P><HI>The Ministers of Christ, under the Cross, who∣ever they be, may comfort themselves, in being made Conformable to their Lord and Master, when their Sayings and Doings are so perverted, when they are Laden with mock Titles, and Scourged by the lose Tongues of others, who yet have their Hands bound in some measure, as the High-Priests and Elders, had by a Superior Power.</HI></P></Q>
<P>For fear I should not be <HI>Satanically</HI> enough <HI>Sambenitoed</HI> by those passages, he has lit upon a <HI>Third</HI> method of Reviling: He falls upon the <HI>Ministers</HI> as having opposed the <HI>Reassump∣tion</HI> of the <HI>Old Charter</HI> by the people, after the <HI>Revolution</HI>; but <HI>I</HI> must be singled out, as having been above the rest in that opposi∣tion. Come then, you shall have the Truth of that matter too. Let all the world know, if they please, that I was against our making a <HI>Revolution</HI> on this Bottom, that the Con∣demnation of our <HI>Charter</HI> was invalid; and that the Judgment passed upon it in the Court of <HI>Chancery,</HI> however <HI>Hard</HI> enough yet) was <HI>Null</HI> and <HI>Void.</HI> On that Bottom it was impossible to have maintained it: neither the condition of <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Things</HI> here at home, nor the Relation we bore to <HI>England,</HI> would have admitted it: No, it was to be Bottom∣ed
<PB N="46" REF="000975_0045_0FAE8D742B905030"/>
on the Invasions that had been given to our <HI>English Liberties,</HI> rather than our <HI>Char∣ter Liberties.</HI> Before the former Governour and Magistrates <HI>Reassumed</HI> their places, I then thought (and so did much wiser men) it was necessary, a <HI>Convention</HI> should give them assu∣rance that the <HI>Colony</HI> would yield <HI>Obedience.</HI> When this was done, the <HI>Old Government</HI> was <HI>Reassumed,</HI> and the <HI>Old Charter</HI> too was <HI>Reassumed,</HI> as far as it was possible to be done; Every thing in the world was done, but only declaring that the <HI>Judgment</HI> passed in the Kings Court of <HI>Chancery</HI> (however it might be thought a Grievance) did the <HI>Charter</HI> no <HI>Damage</HI>; which if some were wiser then to say, who can help it? Well, did I oppose this <HI>Reassumption!</HI> They that were acquainted with me, I am sure, did not think so; and they that sent their <HI>Tory Pamphlets</HI> about the Countrey against me, as an <HI>Impudent Youth,</HI> or my assisting the <HI>Reassumed Government,</HI> I am sure did not think so.

<P>The last effort of his Malice is a <HI>Postscript</HI> against the Life of Sir <HI>William Phips</HI>: against whose Memory, why any whose <HI>throats are an open Sepulchre,</HI> should be so moustrously envious, that like <HI>Jackalls,</HI> they can't let him rest quietly in a <HI>Sepulchre,</HI> Good men can't imagine any reason, but the <HI>third Chapter of Genesi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> But all Considerate men will now believe, that the Invectives of such as this <HI>Calef,</HI> against that good Spirited and well Meriting person, are as true as that which <HI>Calef</HI> sayes, was uttered before the Kings <HI>Council-board</HI> against him, That Sir <HI>William</HI> stopt the proceedings against the <HI>Witchcrafts, because his own Lady was Accused.</HI> A most putid Slander!

It seems,

I must now write an <HI>Apology,</HI> for that Book: for which I have no Confession to make, but, <HI>That I don't wish one Line of it unwritten.</HI> I have expresly declared, in the First Section of it; <HI>It is not any Partiality for the Memory of my Deceased Friend, or any other Sinister design whatsoever, that hath Invited me to this undertaking; but I have undertaken this matter from a sincere Desire, that the Ever Glorious Lord JESƲS CHRIST may have the Glory of His Power and Goodness, and of His Provi∣dence, in what He did for such a Person, and in what He Disposed &amp; Assisted him to do for Him.</HI> Some (I <HI>know, why</HI>?) have wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hed, That Book had not been written, But others, not inferiour to them, do Bless God, that ever it was written. And I think, and so do many more that love their Countrey, think, I had Reason enough to write it: If some think, I had <HI>not,</HI> however I have done <HI>Them</HI> no Hurt; and I do not often see Reason, in other cases as well as <HI>This,</HI> to be of <HI>Their</HI> opinion. Gentlemen of as good sense as any of them, in Letters from <HI>England,</HI> please to thank me for that Book; adding, <HI>They who find fault with the Character of that person, are men who have not the Courage to Imitate his Vertues.</HI> And Gentlemen of Greater Figure than any of them, in their Letters, are pleased to say, <HI>Your Account of Sir</HI> William Phips'<HI>s

<P>That History is, I remember concluded with a well known passage in <HI>Suida<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> That an <HI>Envious man</HI> once going to pull down a <HI>Statue,</HI> which had been Erected unto the memory of one whom he Maligned, he only got this by it, that the <HI>Statue</HI> falling down, knock'd out his <HI>Brains.</HI> It was but <HI>Justice</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rudence,</HI> that one who so deserved of his Countrey as
<PB N="51" REF="000975_0050_0FAE8D79894D5130"/>
that Gentlemen did, should have a <HI>Statue,</HI> and all that have hitherto gone to hurt it, have only got an <HI>ill Name</HI> unto themselves. I would advise those unkind people to desist from such a Barbarous and Ungenteel way of treating a Deceased Gentleman; for his <HI>Friends</HI> are so furnished, that these people will only dash and wound themselves against a <HI>Tombstone</HI> that will not be broken. And Considerate men will think, and it will not be easy to perswade the Body of the people in this Countrey otherwise, That Sir <HI>Williams</HI> Exemplary love to his Countrey, and the Churches in it, and his not giving himself up to evil Courses, is all their Quarrel against him. The History was no sooner abroad, but in the Praeface to the Life of Mr. <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey,</HI> I inserted such words as these; <HI>That Malice it self may never hiss with the least Colour of Reason any more, I do here declare; let any man Living, Evince any one material mistake in any of my Composures, it shall have the most Publick Recantation that can be desired.</HI> All men will say this offer was fair. Well, when mine (and Religions) Adversaries, had with a concocted malice, done all they could, they thought at last they had found one passage, wherein they might impeach my Veracity. I had said, That before <HI>Quebeck,</HI> Sir <HI>William</HI> lay <HI>within Pistol-Shot of the Enemies Canon,</HI> and
<PB N="52" REF="000975_0051_0FAE8D7A2D269418"/>
that his Ship was Shot through, in <HI>an Hundred places,</HI> &amp; that it was Shot through, with <HI>Four and Twenty Pounders.</HI> (Tis a gross Hardship for any to take my meaning, as if <HI>all</HI> the Shot had been so.) And now they fall to Tragical Exclamations; they think <HI>Four and Twenty Pounders</HI> to be too small Dimensions, for the Clamours they must Batter me with∣al? But, hold <HI>Robin,</HI> I am not so soon <HI>Shot through</HI>; and the <HI>Statue</HI> as I told thee, has <HI>knock'd out thy Bra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s.</HI> I wrote no more than the very words, which I find in a Journal of the Expidition to <HI>Quebec</HI>; and as any <HI>Gentle∣man</HI> may see it if he will, so there is no <HI>Gentleman</HI> but what will count this my suf∣ficient Excuse. <HI>Calef</HI> himself has lately own∣ed, that that he verily believes I did so; Where then, my Friend, where was the Conscience of this Out-Cry on my <HI>Fidelity?</HI> However, I began to suspect, that I had been betrayed unawares, to <HI>Flourish</HI> this ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er with more of a <HI>Rhetorical Liberty,</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n <HI>Historical Exactness</HI>; and I was almost ready, humbly to beg Pardon for one Pa∣ragraph (in all my poor Treatises) as guilty of aggravating a matter with too florid Circumstances, But now the matter shall not go over so. Our Friend <HI>Calef</HI> sayes, <HI>That they were not nearer the Enemy, then half or three quarters of a Mile,</HI> and there <HI>might be in all, Seven Shot that struck the Hull of the
<PB N="53" REF="000975_0052_0FAE8D7B1A18D8E0"/>
Vessel</HI>? and <HI>that non<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of them were known to be bigger than Eighteen Pounders, the Enemy having but one Gun, that could carry an Eighteen-Pound-Ball.</HI> Now, behold how the attempts of my Adversaries to prove a <HI>Falshood</HI> in me, <HI>Rec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> upon themselves. I affirm, that every one of his Assertions are <HI>False</HI>; and I entreat you to repair to as honest men, as any aboard the Ship, who if they do not under their <HI>Hands</HI> demonstrate, that the Assertions of <HI>Calef</HI> are every one of them <HI>False,</HI> and if they do not also Testifie and Justifie the <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>h</HI> of what I have written, yea, that some of those Individual <HI>Four &amp; Twenty Pounders</HI> have been long used in some Domestick uses among our Neigh∣bours; I am content, you should say what you please concerning me. But if mankind will not now Conspire to deny me Justice, they will ac∣knowledge, that the <HI>Truth</HI> of my <HI>Historical Wri∣tings,</HI> has nothing short of a <HI>Triumph</HI> in this Thing: when my fiercest Enemies (for such my poor Zeal to serve the Holy Churches of the Lord has procured me) have ransacked as much as they pleased of what I have written, they can fix but upon one passage, which after all is found so incontestable.</P>
<P>To take Notice of the many other obnox∣ious Things in this <HI>odd Book,</HI> would be Endless, and Useless. And yet now my Hand is in, I am content, that there be Two Remarks more made upon it.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="000975_0053_0FAE8D7D86CD5540"/>First, Can <HI>You</HI> Comprehend, (for my part, I cannot!) where lies the Ingenuity or Sig∣nificancy, of my Neighbour <HI>Calefs</HI> Argumen∣tations? He pretends, to write a Book to prove, <HI>That there are no such Witches,</HI> as do hurt, by Confaederacies with <HI>Devils,</HI> &amp; that though the Bible expressly say, concerning the <HI>Witch</HI> of <HI>Endor, She was a Mistriss of a Spirit,</HI> yet there is no need of Believing what the <HI>Bible</HI> sayes.) Well, How does he prove it? Thus; If Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> got several Ministers, to give him a Testimonial of his Fidelity in his Agency, <HI>then there are no Witches.</HI> But he did so; Therefore, — Again; If Mr. <HI>Ma∣ther</HI> procured Sir <HI>William Ph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ps</HI> to be Governour, that he might get himself Establish∣ed Praesident of the <HI>Colledge, then there are no Witches.</HI> But he did so; Therefore, — Once more, If the <HI>French</HI> at <HI>Quebec</HI> Shot no Four and Twenty Pounders, <HI>then there are no W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tches.</HI> But the former is true; Therefore, — Ad∣mirably argued! — But because the <HI>Conse∣quence</HI> in these wonderful Arguments, is beyond <HI>my</HI> Reach, I must satisfy my self with only Denying the <HI>Assumption</HI> in each of them. No wonder that our Author threatens us, with <HI>Refusing to admit unto the work of the Ministry, those that have been Educated in School-Learning.</HI> All our dull <HI>School Learning</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="000975_0054_0FAE8D7E67A10118"/>
would never Enable a man, to penetrate into the Sense and Force of this Incompara∣ble Reasoning. Truly, to penetrate into it, would rather be to prove <HI>That there are Witches</HI>: For who but <HI>Witches,</HI> were able to do it?</P>
<P>Secondly, Though there are many Impi∣ous Assertions, in my Neigbour <HI>Calefs</HI> Vo∣lumn, yet there is but one that I shall ob∣serve to you, because the Impiety of it, out-does all the rest, &amp; almost all that ever I read in my Life. His words at the Eightieth page, are these: <HI>To say, that God did at any time i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>power a Witch, to work wonders, to gain belief to the Doctrine of Devils, were with one Breath, to destroy root and branch, all Revealed Religion.</HI> I pray Sirs, now turn to Deut. 13.1, 2. <HI>If there arise among you a Prophet, or a Dreamer of Dream, &amp; gives thee a Sign or a Wonder, &amp; the Sign or the Wonder come to pass, whereof he spake to thee, saying, Let us go after other Gods, — Thou shalt not hearken to the words of that Prophet: for the Lord your God proveth you.</HI></P>
<P>Yea, 'tis expresly said concerning the great∣est <HI>idolater</HI> that ever was in the world, Rev. 13.14. <HI>He Deceives them which dwell on the Earth, by means of those MIRACLES which he had POWER to do</HI> And Rev. 19.20. <HI>The False Prophet wrought MIRACLES, with which
<PB N="56" REF="000975_0055_0FAE8D7FDCE293B8"/>
he DECEIVED.</HI> Whereas, according to <HI>Calef,</HI> if there do arise a <HI>False Prophet,</HI> (which by the way, is a <HI>Witch,</HI> according to his Definition of one) and he should have power to do a <HI>Sign</HI> or a <HI>Wonder,</HI> and he should say, <HI>I Preach to you another God, besides Jesus Christ, you must let go all the Revealed Re∣ligion of Jesus Christ</HI>; We have a sufficient warrant now to give up all the <HI>Revealed Reli∣gion</HI> of our Holy Jesus, to Turn <HI>Mahometan,</HI> or <HI>Deists,</HI> or <HI>Pagans,</HI> or any thing that a <HI>Devil</HI> shall propose unto us. <HI>Calef</HI> teaches us, to <HI>go after other God,</HI> if a <HI>Witch</HI> may <HI>work wonders</HI> to invite us unto it; and this he does, after he had said, (p. 25.) That a <HI>Possessed person</HI> being lifted up, and held a space of several minutes in the Air, [of which being done in our Neighbourhood, he had several uncontroulable Testimonies, of Neigh∣bours, that are far honester men than himself,] <HI>is as true a miracle,</HI> as those re∣corded in the Scripture. And it is well known, That the <HI>Quakers</HI> formerly, and espe∣cially that Goblin <HI>Tom Case,</HI> often did <HI>Wonders</HI> (not much inferiour to those of <HI>Apollonius Tyaneus,</HI> of which you have read,) if this were one, that by <HI>Breath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng</HI> or <HI>Stroaking</HI> on people, they would make them follow them, like so many <HI>Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>els</HI> all the Countrey over; or if this were one, that by fixing their Eye
<PB N="57" REF="000975_0056_0FAE8D802FD7B228"/>
on some of their followers at any time, they would make them voluntarily <HI>Fall</HI> &amp; <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oam</HI> &amp; <HI>Roll</HI> about, until they came unto the <HI>Feet</HI> of of these Enchanters, who by a Touch of their <HI>Hands</HI> would then set them upon their <HI>Feet</HI> again. To tell us, we must part with <HI>Root and Branch of all Revealed Religion,</HI> if Sedu∣cers may get power to <HI>work wonders,</HI> is as Dangerous and as Damnable a position, as ever dropt from the Pen of man: 'tis fit only to be written with a Quill of an <HI>Harpy.</HI> Where, I beseech you, where is the <HI>Grace</HI> or <HI>Sense</HI> of such <HI>Readers,</HI> (or are any such <HI>Readers</HI> worthy to be <HI>Teachers</HI> of others?) who could Read over this Book, and say <HI>They saw no Hurt in it!</HI> Give me leave: That vile Book of <HI>Tom Maules,</HI> which the General Court Condemned unto the <HI>Flames,</HI> had not in it a more hideous piece of Doctrine, then this of <HI>Robert Calef.</HI> I pray, let <HI>Serious Christians</HI> Consider it!</P>
<P>And indeed, <HI>Serious Christians</HI> have already Considered the Book so far, that this man has made himself <HI>too manifest unto all men,</HI> for him to <HI>proceed any further</HI> with any success▪ People at first were a little eager to see the Book, as they would be to see a <HI>Prodigy</HI>; for they generally reckoned it a very <HI>Prodigy</HI> of wickedness. But they are now satisfied, That if he should go on to write never so
<PB N="58" REF="000975_0057_0FAE8D80F7DC04B0"/>
many more such <HI>Volumns,</HI> they would lye upon his hands; no sober people would vouchsafe to look upon them.</P>
<P>I will give your patience no further trou∣ble. <HI>Satan</HI> was doubtless in hopes by these <HI>Libels,</HI> to damnify my precious <HI>Opportunities,</HI> of serving the Lord Jesus Christ: But as I have cause to hope, that the Lord <HI>will-requite me Good for the Cursing</HI> that I have encountred; so, my <HI>Opportunities</HI> to do Good, will be strangely preserved and increased. They are not in <HI>Satans</HI> hands; I commit my cause to Him that <HI>Judges Righteously</HI>: and I would humbly hope, That nothing shall befal me, but what shall promote the <HI>Evangelical Inte∣rests.</HI> In the mean time, though this <HI>Profane Mocker</HI> do Scoff at the recording of <HI>Remark∣able Providences</HI>; and among such, he par∣ticulary enumerates this, That the first person, whose Funeral our new Bell toll'd for▪ was one of my Children, which by the way, is a gross <HI>Lye</HI> in matter of Fact; &amp; if it had been true, I know nothing so very <HI>Remarkable</HI> in it!] yet I would not have him Scoff too much at <HI>Re∣markable Providences</HI>; for he does not know, what the Hand of Heaven may do upon himself.</P>
<P>All I would add, shall be to tell you, what
<PB N="59" REF="000975_0058_0FAE8D81ABD0E758"/>
Use I would make of these <HI>Allaetrations.</HI> I remember, I have read, That the <HI>Muscovites</HI> travelling vast Journies on the <HI>Ice,</HI> in <HI>Sledds</HI> drawn by <HI>Reine Deer,</HI> to make the <HI>Deer</HI> dis∣patch with incredible Diligence, they tye a <HI>Dog</HI> in the <HI>Sled,</HI> who by his continual <HI>Bark∣ing</HI> sets the <HI>Deer</HI> a running with such speed, as to Draw its burthen (they tell us) Forty Leagues a day. I hope, I am travelling to the <HI>Heavenly World,</HI> and carrying as many with me thither as I can: But I Fear I am too Slothful; through my Slothfulness, I don't use Dispatch enough; (though my Flattering Friends think this the least of my Faults.) Now, that I may be quickned in my <HI>Heavenly Work,</HI> and <HI>Heavenward Race,</HI> there must it seems, be provided for me something to <HI>Bark</HI> at me so Loud, that all the Countrey shall hear of it. Now, God forbid, that I should complain of so wise a Dispensation. It won't be long before I am out of Hearing, and where the <HI>wicked cease from Troubling.</HI></P>

Had you duely Considered that Text, Zech. 2.8. <HI>He that toucheth you, toucheth the Apple of mine Eye</HI>; we have Charity to hope, you would never have ventured, as in your <HI>Book</HI> you have done, even, to put those <HI>Servants</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> into <HI>Bear Skins,</HI> for you know who to worry them. You can't but see some such Effects already in what you have done. We pray God <HI>Pardon</HI> your Sin, and give you the <HI>Grace</HI> to Repent. You may, for all us, write what <HI>Arguments</HI> you

please, for the Defence of your own <HI>Principles,</HI> and if you had only done so <HI>Now,</HI> you would never in this <HI>Way</HI> have heard from us; where∣fore our <HI>Advice</HI> to you is (if it be worth taking) whatever you do, don't venture to insinuate, any more such <HI>Slanders</HI> and <HI>Falshoods</HI> to the world, as you have already done; but if the <HI>Evil Spirit</HI> tempt you to it, Let <HI>us</HI> entreat you, before you do it▪ seriously to Consider, Mat. 25.42. where our Saviour sayes, <HI>He takes what is done to His, as done to Himself</HI>: For we are sure, according to Charity, you dare not say, they are not the <HI>Servants of Christ,</HI> &amp; <HI>Faithful in their Generation.</HI></P>
<P>We shall now add no more; But we read, that when some persons not of the greatest Figure, appeared for the Blessed <HI>Paul,</HI> against them that were his Adversaries, <HI>all the Churches gave them Thanks.</HI> Thus we do believe, that the <HI>Churches,</HI> will <HI>give us Thanks,</HI> for our ap∣pearing to Vindicate in this manner the Re∣putation of our Pastors; (we are verily per∣swaded, few will so openly make themselves <HI>partakers of this mans Sins,</HI> as to express any dislike of so Just an action:) Because it was the end of Satan, to hinder all the <HI>Churches,</HI> from the Good and Benefit of their Labours. But we shall undoubtedly find <HI>Satan</HI> and his <HI>Instruments</HI> frustrated.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="000975_0065_0FAE8D8C10DBB838"/>To conclude, we cannot hear of any one Pious person, that does approve of <HI>Robert Ca∣less</HI> most <HI>Scandalous Book.</HI> Many rather think that the writer of it, ought to have some <HI>Exemplary</HI> Punishment inflicted on him, that others might <HI>hear and fear, and that none may hereafter do any more so wickedly.</HI> He falls under the weight of many <HI>Prayers</HI>; For we can assure him, that more than a <HI>Few,</HI> have carried him before God, with <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>laints</HI> of the Injuries which he hath done to the <HI>Name</HI> of Christ, by Slandering His Faithful and Eminent <HI>Servants.</HI> He has done <HI>Them</HI> much wrong, and may fear that the <HI>Lord will Reward him according to his works.</HI></P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>WHile these Papers were in the Press, it was understood, That some endeavour∣ed to make this Vindication to be of no Effect, by Cavilling, That it is a Fallacy, and that it is <HI>the Work</HI> of the <HI>Pastors</HI> Vindicated, &amp; none of <HI>The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs</HI> who have set their Names unto it. Now, tho' the work will sufficiently clear it self, to all Impartial Readers, and there are other witnesses enough to prove this Cavil to be False; Yet that no person may be so unreasonable as to mention it any more, it hath been thought not amiss to annex the ensuing Declaration.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>THat we may clear our Friends from a Calumny, we hear cast upon them, as if one of us were the Author, of what goes under <HI>their Name,</HI> in their <HI>Essay</HI> for our just Vindication, we do hereby Declare (each of us for himself,) <HI>That the said Calumny is very False.</HI> Yea, we were so far from Composing of this <HI>Essay,</HI> that we <HI>Earnestly</HI> but <HI>Fruitlesly,</HI> ask'd of them, to <HI>Abate</HI> some Expressions, of their Good and Kind opinions concerning us, which are now Occurring in it.</P>
<P>And if the plain <HI>Dissimilitude of Style,</HI> were
<PB N="68" REF="000975_0067_0FAE8D8CEC1B36C8"/>
not a sufficient Evidence for them, yet no man knows the Flock whereto they belong, who does not know, That there are many persons in it, whose <HI>Talents</HI> would enable them to write as well as <HI>this Book</HI> is written, and much better than <HI>that</HI> which this hath an∣swered.</P>
<P>But what needs any more be said? When <HI>One</HI> of these <HI>Seven Brethren,</HI> more than Ten years ago, had a Discourse of his own Printed, in a <HI>Style</HI> not inferiour to this; And (not more particularly to mention <HI>One</HI> of the <HI>Seven Subscribers,</HI> who with <HI>Joy</HI> set his Hand unto this work, while he lay Sick of the Sickness that carried him to a better World, and went thither the more <HI>Joyfully</HI> for his having done so;) <HI>Others</HI> of them have not improved so lit∣tle under their Evangelical Advantages and Exercises, that they should be unable to write as well as now they do: Though which of them, hath been <HI>most</HI> concerned in it, we perceive they are not willing to have exposed.</P>
<P>For the Satisfaction of the Publick we judge it convenient further to add, That▪ we so far despised the Assaults, which our <HI>Inconside∣rable Adversary</HI> had made upon us, as to think it not worth the while to answer his Imper∣tinent <HI>Libels</HI> and <HI>Slanders.</HI> Nor did we ever
<PB N="69" REF="000975_0068_0FAE8D8E18F943C8"/>
propose it unto <HI>any O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> of the Brethren in our Church, to Answer them for us.</P>
<P>And when These, with more Brethren, came to us, with an offer to do, what they have now done, though we could not but heartily Thank them for their Affection to us, [<HI>The Lord give Mercy to them and their Houses, who were not Ashamed of our Cause</HI>!] Yet we had never permitted them to do it, if it had not been for <HI>This</HI> Consideration; That albeit there was little Hazard, that the Dirt, of our <HI>Adversaries Book</HI> (which we <HI>bind as a Crown unto us</HI>) would at all so stick as to Damnify our precious opportunities, to Glo∣rifie our Lord Jesus Christ in this Countrey, where we have been known from our Child∣hood; but the poor man (whom we heartily pity) and his Book, had only made them∣selves <HI>Loathsome</HI> to all <HI>Sober People</HI>: Never∣theless the Dirty Book, was carried abroad unto some of the <HI>Islands,</HI> where it was more needful for us to have our Friends furnished with our <HI>Vindication</HI>: And we were also sen∣sible, That there were many Good men, who would be glad of being informed in many <HI>Particulars,</HI> which are brought now to light.</P>
<P>But even in this matter also, we were grown somewhat <HI>Cold,</HI> until some would have
<PB N="70" REF="000975_0069_0FAE8D8EF70167D8"/>
perswaded our Brethren, to desist from their Action, because our Enemies Threatned, <HI>That they would write again, and bring to light other things,</HI> (we know not what) <HI>against us.</HI> These <HI>Threats</HI> only Confirmed us in our <HI>Con∣sent</HI> and <HI>Advice,</HI> That our Brethren should go on, and rendred it indeed absolutely Ne∣cessary▪ For we have not Lived so, but that (through the Grace of Christ) we can Defie all the <HI>Malice</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> our Enemies. Let them tell all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they can possibly discover concerning us: But if they go on with telling of <HI>Lies,</HI> the <HI>Insatuated men</HI> have already-done so much that way, that they have only laid <HI>themselves</HI> open unto the Resentments of Good men, from one end of the Land unto the other, and (while <HI>we</HI> were far from doing or wishing them any <HI>Hurt</HI>) they have <HI>Hurt themselves</HI> a Thousand Times more than either of us. Yea, the Glorious Lord, <HI>whose we are, and whom we serve,</HI> will cause <HI>those that seek our Soul, to destroy it,</HI> (and our <HI>Op∣portunities</HI> to do good unto the <HI>Souls of others,</HI> which are dear to us as our <HI>own Souls</HI>) to find first or last the fulfilment of that word, <HI>The mouth of them that speak Lies shall be stopped.</HI></P>
<P>All we have to add is, That we would <HI>Bless and not Curse those who Persecute <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> and fervently Pray to God, for His <HI>Best Blessings</HI>
<PB N="71" REF="000975_0070_0FAE8D8F2B61CA08"/>
on the very <HI>Worst</HI> of all our <HI>Persecutors</HI>: and would have them know, That though they may oblige us to <HI>Defend</HI> our selves, we hope, they shall not provoke us to <HI>Revenge</HI> any wrongs they may do unto us. And if any by their Envious Vexing and Carping, at the fair <HI>Vindication</HI> of our <HI>Innocency,</HI> do make themselves <HI>Parties</HI> with our <HI>Persecutors,</HI> and <HI>Partakers</HI> in the Sins of their Book, and would make <HI>New-England,</HI> the only Countrey where it is a Crime for <HI>Innocency</HI> to have a <HI>Vindication,</HI> we Forgive <HI>these</HI> also, and <HI>Pray,</HI> That they may be Forgiven.</P>
