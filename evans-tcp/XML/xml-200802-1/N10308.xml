<P>Brethren, I count not my self to have apprehended; but this one Thing I do; forgetting those Things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those Things which are before, I press toward the Mark for the Prize of the high-Calling of GOD in CHRIST JESUS.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS, my Brethren, and Friends, is a Day which many Years past I did not expect to have seen. It brings me within a Month of finishing the seventy-second Year of my Life; and this Day will finish the fiftieth Year of my Ministry among you: a Length of Time unfrequently employed in this Work; which it has pleased GOD, the sovereign Arbiter of Life and Death, of his Mer∣cy and good Pleasure, to continue to me; to Him be the Glory and Praise for it.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="013083_0004_0F8EBDC214A43DA0"/>HAVING been desired to entertain you with a Discourse on this Occasion, I would willingly endeavor to stir up your Minds, and my own, to suitable Reflections on some passed Events of divine Providence towards us, and a suitable Im∣provement of them, and endeavor to animate us to more earnest and vehement Aspirations after Christian Improvements and Perfections; to which Purpose I judged the Words of my Text not to be improper: They are Words written by the Apostle Paul, when he was advanced in Years, and had the Prospect of a not far distant De∣parture from this World. The Epistle is suppo∣sed to have been written in the eighth Year of Nero, the 62d of our Lord, when the Apostle was in Bonds at Rome the first Time: From which he intimates his Expectation of Deliverance; and it seems he was delivered from that Chain, but was again committed to Bands, and put to Death at Rome. It seems the Church of the Philippians, though a flourishing Church, was disturbed by judaizing Teachers, who endeavored to keep up the Law of Moses, and mix the Observances of it with the Doctrine of Christ, and his Institutions. And the Apostle begins this Chapter with Warnings against these Sedu∣cers.—He proposes himself as an Example of trusting in Christ only, and not in his Privileges, nor any outward Advantage as conducive to Jus∣tification;
<PB N="7" REF="013083_0005_0F8EBDC227662A98"/>
nor to be regarded in Comparison with CHRIST, to whom he is resolved to cleave: and rejecting all other Things, he would count himself an unspeakable Gainer, if he had an In∣terest in CHRIST and his Righteousness, and might be found in him; if he might feel the Efficacy of his Death, and Resurrection, killing Sin in him, and raising him up to Newness of Life. He lets them know that his Heart was upon Heaven as his Happiness, which in the 11th Verse, is called the Resurrection of the Dead. For though the Souls of the Saints, when they depart, are immediately with CHRIST; yet their Happiness is not compleat 'till the general Re∣surrection; and he was willing to do and suffer any Thing, that he might attain it. Viewing himself in a State of Trial, and Imperfection, he made this Judgment of his Case, he pressed for∣ward, and followed after Christ, endeavoring to get more Grace, and do more Good; not think∣ing he had done enough. In these Verses he makes continual Allusion to the Races run in the Olympian Games, where he that run was ever on the Stretch, pressing forward, without looking back to what he had left behind, keeping the Goal in his Eye, that coming up first to the Mark, he might catch the Prize.—And if such an one as Paul, that great Apostle, who had done and suffered so much for CHRIST,
<PB N="8" REF="013083_0006_0F8EBDC345AE9318"/>
had laboured so abundantly, and was in Deaths so often, was not perfect, nor had obtained the Prize, but must still press with such Ardor; what are we? What concerns us, who are so far be∣hind him? What continual Diligence and Labour does this Pursuit require?</P>
<P>FROM the Words I shall observe three Things as the Subject I shall discourse on.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. THE oldest and best of the Ministers, and Servants of CHRIST, ought to be persuaded they have not yet attained the Measures of Grace and Holiness they ought to have.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. THEY should, in certain Respects, forget all their past Labours and Attainments.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. As long as they live, they should be fervently pursuing after better Attainments in the Knowlege and Love of CHRIST, and pressing towards the Perfection to be had in him.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>I. THE oldest and best of the Ministers, and Servants of CHRIST, ought to be persuaded they have not yet attained the Measures of Grace and Holiness they ought to have.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="013083_0007_0F8EBDC3C9F81408"/>THE Apostle Paul, one of the holiest meer Men that ever lived, makes this Judgment of himself, <HI>I count not myself to have apprehended.</HI> Was it only a local Heaven that he judged he had not attained? No surely; for not only him∣self, but every Body else whom he was conver∣sant with, certainly knew that he was then on Earth. But he counted he had not yet attained these Measures of Grace, Holiness, and Confor∣mity to CHRIST, that Fitness for Heaven, or so much of Heaven as was attainable in this World.</P>
<P N="1">1. THEY should count their Knowlege, and Love of Christ is comparatively small.—The doctrinal Knowlege we have of CHRIST, his Person, Offices and Work, is communicated by the holy Scriptures. With these the Ministers and People of GOD may be well acquainted, and understand the main, yea all Things essential to Salvation: Yet they may be in many Things mistaken, and not well understand them. But the Knowlege of Christ I am speaking of, does espe∣cially intend, the experimental Knowlege of him. Faith in Christ, a Belief in him, upon the Au∣thority, Credit and Veracity of GOD in his Word. A Confidence and Trust in GOD through him, according to his Promise. An experimental Know∣lege of the Glory and Excellency of his Person,
<PB N="10" REF="013083_0008_0F8EBDC48D7459E8"/>
and Offices, and Work; his full Sufficiency.— How short do GOD's People come in this, after all their Attainments and Experience? Much Weakness and Fearfulness of Heart; Abundance of Corruption; Prejudices arising from corrupt Dispositions still remaining; Stirrings of inordi∣nate Desires after worldly Things; immoderate Attachments to Creature Relations and Connecti∣ons, whereby they are hindered in the Exercises of Faith and Holiness; perplexed with many Jealousies and Suspicions concerning the Promises of God, his Love and Grace in CHRIST. What Workings of Self-Righteousness—what Pronity to pride themselves in their own Labours and Services for GOD, to live upon their own Frames and Duties? Even in their Humiliations, how often may they find Pride starting up, and catch them∣selves pleased with themselves, instead of glory∣ing in CHRIST and living upon him? Self-Ends and Designs, and Vanity intermix with their Zeal and Duty to CHRIST. Many a Time have the best Men before as much Reason to groan out as St. Paul did, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.24. <HI>O wretched Man that I am, who shall deliver me from the Body of this Death?</HI> They are at present in a State of Warfare, the Flesh <HI>lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the Flesh, so that ye cannot do the Things that ye would.</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.12. <HI>For we now see through a Glass darkly; now I
<PB N="11" REF="013083_0009_0F8EBDC52B056D80" MS="y"/>
know in Part.</HI> Though their Faith is sincere, yet it is weak. Though their Knowlege be right, yet it is small. Little of the incomprehensible Glories of CHRIST, and the misterious Wisdom and Grace of Redemption, is now known by good Men; Things which the Angels desire to look into. As such as this is the real S<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e of the best of CHRIST's Servants in this World, 'tis needful they should be persuaded of it, and know it is the Truth. 'Tis needful to keep them humble, and abase them before GOD; to make them more entirely dependent on CHRIST; to animate their Desires to receive of his Ful∣ness Grace for Grace.</P>
<P N="2">2. THAT their Labours for CHRIST, and the Fruits of them are comparatively little, and of small Advantage to his Kingdom.—All the sincere Servants, and faithful Ministers of CHRIST, have an evangelical Righteousness; and through the Grace of GOD in CHRIST JESUS will be accepted of GOD. But CHRIST has taught us all to say, <HI>Luke</HI> 17.10. <HI>When ye shall have done all those Things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable Servants: We have done that which was our Duty to do.</HI> How little of Life is employed directly in the Service of CHRIST? If we deduct what is lost in Childhood, and in childish Amusements; in unmeaning Recreations,
<PB N="12" REF="013083_0010_0F8EBDC5E8068178"/>
and Converse with the World, and about the Affairs of it: If we except what is spent in sleeping, and natural Rest; in the necessary Repairs of these feeble Bodies; perhaps not more than a sixth Part will be left for GOD and CHRIST. If through the Grace of GOD we have an ha∣bitual Disposition, whether we eat, or drink, or whatsoever we do, to do all to the Glory of GOD; yet how often do we forget it, and fail of actually doing so? When we call our past Temper and Conduct to Remembrance, how ma∣ny imperfections may we find in the best that we have done? Many Infirmities, many wrong Ends and Views intermix'd with our honest De∣signs and Endeavors. How often do we sleep when we think our Hearts awake? Friends, Relations, worldly Comforts, clog and hinder the Aspirations of the Soul to GOD and Heaven; and hang like dead Weights upon us. How of∣ten do we spend our Time in fruitless Contro∣versies, and Contentions for what seems to us to be Truth, and pertaining to Godliness; little conducive to real Religion; and rather divert us from the Practice of the most important Things of the Gospel. Perhaps we are rather contending for the Mastery of our own Wit and Subtilty, than for the Glory of CHRIST, and to bring Souls to GOD and Heaven. Perhaps have been influenced by Fears of Men, or Hopes from them;
<PB N="13" REF="013083_0011_0F8EBDC6A6DE9B78"/>
discouraged and sunk under the Opposition of Devils and wicked Men; ready to say, Our La∣bours are vain.—Si vult decipi decipiatur.— And how small is the Fruit of all our Labour? Suppose we have been some Way instrumental to turn some to Righteousness, or hope that a Number through our Endeavors have been con∣verted and edified; yet alas! how few, compared with the Numbers who remain carnal and un∣converted?—How many are hardened, and wax worse? What Numbers have we to mourn over, who are going the downward Road, with whom is to be found no real saving Religion, but are neglecting and dropping the very Form of Reli∣gion, and grow weary of the Trouble of what indeed they can have no Pleasure in. How does the blessed Saviour complain, <HI>Isa.</HI> 49.4. <HI>I have la∣bored in vain, and spent my Strength for nought and in vain—Israel is not gathered.</HI> How little is done by Men, and how much needs to be done? Instead of great Revivals of Religion, don't we see Religion greatly decay? If we are sincere, yet the old Man, and the old Serpent, will prove too hard for us.—However, if we have been instrumental of some Good, we have only been Instruments—GOD is the Author of it, we have no Claim to any Thing more than of ha∣ving had the Honor and Happiness of being made Use of by him. If we have been Dili∣gent,
<PB N="14" REF="013083_0012_0F8EBDC7841C4AB8"/>
yea and abounding in Labours, yet we should be annihilated before GOD, and feel as nothing in the View, that the divine Power, through JESUS CHRIST his Grace, does all the Good that is done. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.10. <HI>I laboured more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but the Grace of GOD which was with me.</HI></P>
<P>II. THEY should, in certain Respects, forget all their past Labours and Attainments.</P>
<P>THIS one Thing I do, says the Apostle; q. d. The Substance of what I have said before, and my Resolution now, is to forget the Things that are behind; whatever Services I have done, whatever Attainments I have got; yet I have not attained the Prize. Not that the Apostle did, or that the Saints of CHRIST ought never to think of them more, as their Encouragement, and Reasons of Hope and Thankfulness or com∣fortable Evidences of the Truth and Sincerity of their Faith, and Interest in CHRIST. In this View they ought to remember them, and give GOD the Glory of them, and through Faith plead their Title to the Promises. So did He∣zekiah, <HI>Isa.</HI> 38.3. <HI>Remember now O LORD, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in Truth, and with a perfect Heart, and have done that which is Good in thy Sight.</HI>— But this for∣getting them intends,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="15" REF="013083_0013_0F8EBDC85CC831D0" MS="y"/>1. THEY must be far from resting in them as if they had done enough, or done some great Things for CHRIST. To remember past Expe∣riences of divine Mercy and the good Gifts of GOD, and especially spiritual Favors, is pleasing to GOD. It is a Duty to keep up thankful Memorials of them, and to give GOD the Glory due to his Name for them. This is recorded in Scripture as the Practice of good Men, and accepted of GOD.—The Apostle therefore does not intend that he will shut, or keep them wholly out of his Mind; but that he will not dwell on them, and fancy he has got Grace enough; sit down and sing a Requiem to his Soul, conclu∣ding his Salvation is secured, and he has no Need to trouble himself any further. Since GOD has pardoned his Sins, and is become reconciled to him, he will never recal his Favor, and therefore he has nothing to do but rejoice in his own Security, and need no further Trouble himself about Sin or Duty.—Nor may the best Saints in the World, with all their Attainments and Labours, solace themselves as having done some great Things for CHRIST, and recollecting what eminent Servants they have been to him; as if he was in their Debt, and much obliged to them; and that for the Labours, they may leave for Novices, or new Beginners. This Sort of For∣getfulness belongs rather to Hypocrites, and proud
<PB N="16" REF="013083_0014_0F8EBAB7DB5FDBB8" MS="y"/>
presumptuous Sinners, who have no Grace at all; than to the Faithful, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> eminent Servants of CHRIST. The Servants of GOD should look on all they have done as little, not worthy to be compared with what yet remains to be at∣tained, and the Service they have not done.</P>
<P N="2">2. THEY ought not at all to look to their Labours or Services for their justifying Righte∣ousness, nor to look chiefly to them for their Consolation, and the Evidences of their Grace.</P>
<P>THE best Saint in the World, and the most laborious Servant of CHRIST, ought so to forget all his Attainments in Grace, and all his Labours for CHRIST, as to renounce, disclaim, and count them nothing at all, as to a justifying Righte∣ousness before GOD. They have not the least Hand nor Share in justifying them. There is no Possibility of obtaining Righteousness on the Foot of the Covenant of Works. That Cove∣nant is broke long since, and GOD has never proposed it to any Man since as a Covenant of Life, nor bid any Man seek or expect Life on that Foundation. That required perfect Obedi∣ence, and pronounces <HI>every Man cursed, that con∣tinueth not in all Things that are written in the Law to do them, Gal.</HI> 3.10. Salvation is now to be had only upon the Terms of the Covenant
<PB N="17" REF="013083_0015_0F8EBDC9089DE308"/>
of Grace: And the mediatorial Righteousness of JESUS CHRIST, is that alone Righteousness by which any Son of Adam can appear righteous at the Bar of GOD. Our own Obedience or Holiness has no Share in our justifying Righteous∣ness: CHRIST and his Righteousness alone must be that: A Sinner has nothing else to plead. If a Man depends on any Thing else, in Whole or in Part, to justify him, he must stand at the Bar of GOD and in the Judgment of the Law a guilty undone Sinner.—The holy Attainments, and sincere Labours of good Men, may be com∣fortable Evidences of their Grace, and they some∣times need to look back to such Evidences; but 'tis wrong, and a bad Sign, if Persons make these their chief Evidences, so as on all Occasions to go back to their past Experiences for Comfort against the Accusations of Conscience; to have such Evidences chiefly or wholly to go to, to clear up their State: and if they can recollect such Experiences as give them tolerable Ground of Hope, sit down quiet without seeking new and larger Experiences, more clear Exercises of Faith, Repentance, and Love of GOD, and other holy Actings, and a more spiritual Temper of Heart. Instead of this Way, GOD's Servants should count all their past Experiences of little Moment, in Comparison of progressive Holiness, better Expe∣riences, and living daily upon CHRIST and his
<PB N="18" REF="013083_0016_0F8EBDC9C097F658"/>
Fulness, going out to him for Strength to better Obedience, and a more spiritual, holy Temper and Life.</P>
<P N="3">3. They should count them little in Compa∣rison of what is yet to be obtained from CHRIST, or done for him.—JESUS CHRIST is the inexhaustible Store, and Treasure of all Grace. He is able to communicate his Gifts and Graces to the utmost Degree that the Soul of Man can contain. What good Men have already attained, is little to what they would have, if they were compleatly sanctified; the Services they have done but small, compared with what they might do, if their Hearts were full of GOD, and swal∣lowed up in him; in Comparison of that full compleat Holiness which is to be lived and en∣joyed, when their Corruptions are all abolished, and they fully conformed to the Image of CHRIST. Verse 11. <HI>If by any Means I might attain to the Resurrection of the Dead.</HI></P>
<P>III. OBSERVATION. As long as they live, the Ministers and Servants of CHRIST should fervently follow after better Attainments and Improvements, pressing to Perfection in CHRIST.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="013083_0017_0F8EBDCD7450D280"/><HI>REACHING forth unto those Things which are before, I press toward the Mark for the Prize of the high-Calling, &amp;c.</HI> It has been noted before, that the Expressions allude to the agonistical Ex∣ercises in the Olympian Games. The Mark, the Prize the Christian runs for, is GOD, CHRIST, Heaven; that perfect Holiness and Happiness which is attained through the Knowlege and Love of GOD, and CHRIST. Now we are to leave all Things behind, that nothing may in∣terrupt the Soul in this ardent Pursuit. It should reach towards it with utmost Endeavor, and mind nothing but those Exercises which carry a Man towards it.—I shall mention some plain and obvious Reasons, why the Servants of CHRIST, especially they who are aged, ought thus to em∣ploy the rest of their Time.</P>
<P N="1">1. JESUS CHRIST is infinitely worthy to be known and loved more and better.</P>
<P>IF we consider him in his Person, as an in∣carnate GOD, sufficient Conviction offers, that he is worthy of the greatest Admiration. <HI>In him dwelleth all the Fulness of the Godhead bodily. Angels, Authorities, and Powers, are made subject to him.</HI> He is infinitely more excellent than they. The longest Life, yea Eternity is little and nar∣row enough to be employed in studying, con∣templating,
<PB N="20" REF="013083_0018_0F8EBDCE60852260"/>
loving, and adoring that divine Per∣son, who is the only begotten SON of GOD; the Brightness of the Father's Glory, and the express Image of his Person: eternally begotten of GOD, having essentially all the divine Pro∣perties and Powers; this glorious Person united to the human Nature and compleat Man. These two infinitely distant Natures so intimately united as to be one individual Person, and all the distinct Properties of both remaining entire. A Person glorious above all Blessing and Praise.—If we view his infinite Love and Condescention; in having such Delight in the Sons of Men, such Pity for them, as to come into this World and take our Nature into such an ineffable Union with the Divine, to be qualified to be a Day's-Man between GOD and us; to obey the Law which we had broken; to suffer the Curse which we deserved; to endure the Insults of wicked Men and Devils; to die in our Room, for such Enemies of GOD, such self-ruined, lost, accursed Sinners as we; to vindicate the Honors of GOD's Law, the Rights of his Government; to make Way for the most rich and glorious Exercises of Mercy which does infinite and eternal Honor to the Wisdom, Holiness, the Power and Love of GOD, and the harmonious Actings of all the divine Attributes in the Recovery and Salvation of a World deceived by the Devil, the first and

grand Apostate from GOD; defeating the Craft of Hell and it's Designs to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the divine Perfections in everlasting Reproach, by contra∣vening the Views of GOD in the Creation of the World, and throwing it into Confusion, Dis∣order, and Ruin. Here shine such Wisdom, Ho∣liness, Power and Love, as is above all created Powers. For CHRIST was this World made; by <HI>him, and for him were all Things created.</HI>— The grand Design of GOD in it, was to exhibit and manifest the Glory of the Mediator, his only begotten Son. He deserves the Love, the Admiration, the Pursuit of the whole World. If we are real Christians we love him, for he first loved us. We are apprehended by him, before we apprehend him. We are bound to love him always, and to the utmost Stretch of our Powers; and we can never know him and love him enough.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE more we love and serve him, the greater Perfection we shall attain.</P>
<P>THE Life of a Christian <HI>is hid with CHRIST in GOD.</HI> All the Life we have as Christians, is derived from GOD through JESUS CHRIST. The more we know, and love CHRIST, the more we know and love GOD. GOD designed to discover the Glories of his Nature and mo∣ral
<PB N="22" REF="013083_0020_0F8EBDCFB7E985B8"/>
Character, in CHRIST, above all the Ways of his Manifestation of them to the World. In knowing GOD in the Person, Offices, and Work of CHRIST, we know the most we can know of GOD. <HI>Col.</HI> 2.3. In CHRIST are hid <HI>all the Treasures of Wisdom and Knowlege.</HI> How any sinful fallen Man can love GOD, or his moral Character and Glory, otherwise than as he is exhibited and held forth in CHRIST JESUS, is a Mystery which I think the Bible does not explain. The more we love that Character and Glory of GOD which shines out—JESUS CHRIST, the more Communion we have with him, the more we are sanctified, and conformed to the image of GOD. Our highest Perfection is to be assimilated to CHRIST. All spiritual Life, Strength, Vigor and Activity in Holiness, is communicated from GOD through him, and for his Sake. We have nothing to do with GOD, in any gracious and holy Action, but by him and through him. <HI>No Man cometh to the Father, but by me, Joh.</HI> 14.6. Through him, and by an holy Conformity to his Image, we are made meet for the heavenly Inheritance. For his Sake all the Duties and Obedience of the Saints is rewarded, as well as accepted of GOD; there∣fore the more any Man loves him, the better he serves him, the more Grace he has, the nearer Perfection he comes, and the more glorious Re∣ward he will attain in Heaven.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="23" REF="013083_0021_0F8EBDD06758D0A0"/>3. BECAUSE they have but a short Time in this World for this Work and these Attain∣ments.</P>
<P>ETERNITY is but long enough to know, and love, and serve CHRIST. The longest Life of Man on Earth is but a Span: And when our Lives are almost spent; when so much of them has been lost; when we have done so little, known so little of GOD and CHRIST, loved him so little, and are come very near the Period of our Days; surely we should the more fervent∣ly long for GOD, and move with more swift and ardent Desires towards him; as Bodies move more swiftly, the nearer they come to the Centre of Attraction. When we get nearest the Prize, the Perfection of Holiness and Happiness in GOD, the more intensely we should strain every Nerve, that without Fail we may win the Prize. Knowing the Time is short, we should redeem it, double our Diligence, quickened even by a Fear lest a Promise being left us of entering <HI>into his Rest, we should seem</HI> to come short of it. Our working Time is just over; we should therefore do as much as possible, and as much as possible excite and animate others, as those who feel the Attraction of the heavenly World, and as it were got within Ken of the exalted Glory, the immarcessible Crown which he reaches
<PB N="24" REF="013083_0022_0F8EBDD13B761390"/>
forth to them that run well: feeling the Force of the Apostle's Example, leaving this World more and more out of Sight. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.26. <HI>I there∣fore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I not as one that beateth the Air.</HI></P>
<P>I HOPE, my dear Hearers, you are all per∣suaded that the Word of GOD, and the preach∣ing of it, will be of no real Benefit to us, otherwise than as it is reduced to Practice, makes us wiser and better, promotes Holiness and a divine Life.</P>
<P>THERE might be divers profitable Inferences and Observations noted from the Subject I have been discoursing on; but they would take up too much of your Time now.</P>
<P>AND as this is a peculiar Occasion, that will never happen to me again, you will excuse my Omission of them; while as agreeably to the Subject as I can, I endeavor to call your and my own solemn Thoughts, to what has passed among us since I have lived amongst you, and ministred to you; and to awaken in our Minds some Sense of the Duties which arise from the Works and Dealings of GOD with us, and the Workings of Heart that should follow the Recol∣lection of them: And to excite suitable Reflec∣tions
<PB N="25" REF="013083_0023_0F8EBDD554F97DD8"/>
on our present State.—I think such a Remembrance will not be at all inconsistent with what I have said about forgetting the Things which are behind.</P>
<P>LET us then first review our past State, and GOD's Dealings with us, with proper Reflections and Affections.</P>
<P>IT is this Day fifty Years since I was or∣dained a Minister of the Gospel in this Place. I have great Reason to thank GOD, that he has continued my Life and Opportunities to serve him in the Gospel of his Son, for so long a Period, through many Infirmities: A Term which is beyond the Lot of most of the Ministers of CHRIST. Through the infinite Mercy of GOD in CHRIST JESUS, I hope I may say I have obtained Mercy to be faithful, and sincerely en∣deavored to serve your best Interest, and win you to CHRIST. You are my Witnesses, that in the Course of my Ministry I have chiefly insisted on the Subjects (which I believe to be) the most important Doctrines of the Gospel. The fallen, ruined State of Man by the Breach of the first Covenant, the Corruption and Depravity of our Nature, our utter Impotence to Holiness; and the Impossibility of obtaining Salvation on the Terms of that Covenant.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="013083_0024_0F8EBDD640F17480"/>THE infinite Wisdom and Grace of GOD in the Constitution of a new Covenant, the Cove∣nant of Grace; with, in, and through CHRIST his only begotten and eternal Son. A new Way of Justification, or of Sinners being made Righ∣teous before GOD, by the Imputation of the perfect Righteousness of JESUS CHRIST the Mediator; who has perfectly fulfilled the Law, and borne the Curse of it due to us; for us, and in our Stead; brought in an everlasting Righteousness, and <HI>is able to save to the utter∣most all that come unto GOD by him, seeing he ever liveth to make Intercession for them.</HI> The Law of Faith, through which Sinners are justi∣fied before GOD, without Works of their own. A Faith of the Operation of GOD. The Ne∣cessity of a Change of the Heart by the Holy SPIRIT. Repentance towards GOD, a turn∣ing from dead Works unto GOD. The Neces∣sity of new Obedience, and Holiness of Heart and Life, derived from CHRIST by Faith which worketh by Love: The supreme Love of GOD, which is the Principle of all true Obedience working out in all Duty to GOD, and Virtue to Men: And that Benevolence which is the fulfilling of the Law. In the Belief of which Doctrines I pray GOD you may be more and more confirmed and established.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="013083_0025_0F8EBDD7B9B90DC8"/>I HAVE not knowingly or willingly shunned to declare unto you the whole Counsel of GOD for your Salvation, so far as he has imparted the same to me. I have had the Comfort, through most of the Time of my Ministry among you, to see you in Peace; preserved from many Snares and Deceits which have been laid to seduce you, and been favored with your Esteem and Respect. —It has pleased GOD to give several Revivals of Religion among you, and one very general, in which the most of the People were under Awakening, and religious Concern; and I hope not a few only, have been made savingly ac∣quainted with JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>BY many the Gospel Ordinances have been attended with visible Seriousness and Diligence.— There have been baptised, since I came among you, two thousand two hundred and eighty Per∣sons.—There have been received to full Com∣munion, seven hundred and thirty seven.—Three hundred and twenty eight have renewed the Co∣venant. How many of these have been ingrafted into CHRIST, and born again, is known to GOD. I trust a good Number of them have. Many of those are dead. They of them who were regenerated and sanctified, are gone to the Church triumphant; joining now the Church of the first-born in Heaven, in the Adorations and
<PB N="28" REF="013083_0026_0F8EBDD819117EE8"/>
Praises of GOD and the LAMB.—Some have removed to other Places.—Some who still live with us are grown up, and some grown old.— Now it greatly concerns us all, to bless GOD for the visible Favors and Privileges which he has blessed us with; that he has brought us into his visible Church and Covenant; putting and keeping us under the Ordinances and Means of Salvation.—Certainly it very much concerns us all, without Delay, to see and know whether we are real, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> only nominal visible Christians. Let no one live a Day longer, without coming to a Point, whether he has received CHRIST JESUS the LORD, and is united to him by a living Faith. If you have not been broken off from all other Dependance, and received CHRIST as your alone Righteousness; if your entire Trust be not on him for Justification; if you mix your Privileges, your Duties, and the Observances of the Law, with CHRIST's Righteousness, for your Plea, and the Ground of your Hope for Life; verily CHRIST shall profit you nothing: For CHRIST <HI>is not divided; he will not give his Glory to another.</HI> If you are so happy as to be appre∣hended by CHRIST, see how you have walked in him. Have you lived a Life of Holiness? Has the Love of CHRIST constrained to daily Sanctification, and Dedication of yourselves to GOD? Your Hearts, your Lives, your All?
<PB N="29" REF="013083_0027_0F8EBDD8B71B1228"/>
Do you love GOD—Do you love the LORD JESUS above all Things? Do you live in Be∣nevolence and the Peace of the LORD JESUS, and abound in his Work? Is your chief Desire after Holiness, and a nearer Conformity to the Image of CHRIST, and his Pattern in all Re∣lations, Conditions, and Connections of Life? Is it your greatest Burden, and most pungent Grief, that you love him so little, and serve him no better? Seeing GOD has done so much for us, we ought to have done much more for him, to live more active and vigilant in his Service; for the Design and Tendency of his Goodness, is to lead us to Repentance.</P>
<P>BUT we have also had many solemn and aw∣ful Warnings of his Providence; Reproofs of our Sloth and Stupidity: Admonitions to Watch∣fulness and Diligence.—We have seen our Friends and Brethren yearly dying. I have been wont yearly to put you in Remembrance, how many have left the World, and what Use we should make of the Works of GOD among us.— I did not, in the first Years of my Ministry, keep a particular Account of the Deaths of Per∣sons in this Place. It was about the Year 1729, or 30, I began to keep such an Account: But by some Means it is lost for the first six or seven Years.—The Account which I find began
<PB N="30" REF="013083_0028_0F8EBDD970824620"/>
with the Year 1737. The Number which have died in this Society, from the Beginning of the Year 37, to this present Time, is seven hundred and Seven. It may gratify your Curiosity to know, that of these one hundred were past se∣venty Years of Age.—Now, if we suppose there died a like Proportion from the Beginning of the Year 23, to the End of the Year 36, the first 14 Years of my Ministry (of which I have no Account) as died in the following 14 Years, which I judge not to be an improbable Suppo∣sition, (especially since in one or two of those Years, the Throat-Distemper swept away many;) then in that Time there died three hundred thirty two; which added to the Number 707, make the whole Number which have died in this Society, during the Years of my Ministry here, to be one thousand and thirty nine.— So you see, my Friends and Brethren, GOD has never left himself without Witness, nor us with∣out Warning. All these have cried to us,
<Q>Be ye also ready; the animated Dust you carry about must soon be as mine, which is covering with Earth, and turning to common Dust. Now is the Time to get ready to die. Work while the Day lasts; the Night is coming in which you cannot work.</Q>
And so says the Word of GOD, <HI>Eccl.</HI> 9.10. <HI>Whatsoever thy Hand findeth to do, do it with thy Might; for there is
<PB N="31" REF="013083_0029_0F8EBDDA33580330"/>
no Work, nor Device, nor Knowlege, nor Wisdom in the Grave whither thou goest.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT shall I now say, my Friends?—After these thousand solemn Warnings, and ten thou∣sand others in the Providence and Word of GOD, are there any here grown up, are there any grown old, and not ready to die? If there be any such, think now, O think, how an unconverted and unsanctified Sinner can die, after so many Ad∣monitions from the dead, after so many Calls, Warnings, Invitations, and Directions from the most high and blessed GOD, and the glorious REDEEMER.</P>
<P>LET it shame and humble Christians, that ye have made no greater Proficiency in Holiness; that you don't daily live with your Loins girt, and your Lamps burning, waiting, looking, long∣ing for the coming of the LORD.</P>
<P N="2">2. LET us be hence led to serious Reflections on our present State.—The most of my Hear∣ers are, I suppose, not 50 Years old. The most who belong to this Place, have grown up under my Ministry; but some there be who are old, yea older than myself. You can compare our present State with that of our Fathers, who are gone from this World. Do the like Fruits of
<PB N="32" REF="013083_0030_0F8EBAB732463958"/>
the SPIRIT appear among us, in Proportion to our Numbers, as did in their Times? Do you see so much Care, and visible Devotion, in at∣tending the Worship of GOD, in the Sanctifica∣tion of the Sabbath, and the Ordinances of the Gospel? Such Concern for religious Conferences and Converse on the Subjects of experimental Religion? Such Sobriety, Temperance, Purity of Manners? Such apparent Care to deal sin∣cerely with GOD, and justly towards Men? Such Dread of Unrighteousness, Dishonesty, and Im∣purity—such a sacred Thirst for Peace—such Be∣nevolence, and Endeavor to do Good to others— such Hatred of Injury, Backbiting, Falshood, and all the black Acts of Envy and Calumny? Is not lost out from among many, a Veneration for GOD and his Ordinances, Zeal for his Wor∣ship and Honor, the Peace of the Church and Society? Have not the cursed Fruits of the Flesh, which are from beneath, sadly succeeded the Fruits of the SPIRIT?—Are the Gospel Ordinan∣ces, through the Grace of GOD, made effectual to Holiness; or do they rather seem to be a Savour of Death unto Death? Do we see our Youth and Children setting out for GOD, and seeking first the Kingdom of GOD and the Righ∣teousness thereof? Or seeking the Vanities of the World? Set upon sensual Pleasures and Recreati∣ons? Obstinate to Reproof, impatient of Re∣straint?
<PB N="33" REF="013083_0031_0F8EBDDAE9916F08"/>
Without a Taste and Relish for Reli∣gion, drinking in that Wisdom which is earthly, sensual, devilish?</P>
<P>IT concerns you all to consider seriously and examine thoroughly if this be the Case. And if it be so, it is high Time to awake out of Sleep. Such of you as have Families, should resolve first to give your own Selves to CHRIST, and to devote your Families to him, and travel in birth for them 'till CHRIST be formed in them. Let me beseech, and charge you, by the Help of divine Grace, to keep up Religion in your Fa∣milies; to keep your Children under a just and proper Government; see they have the best Edu∣cation you can give them, that they may be trained up in the Nurture and Admonition of the LORD, kept out of the Company of evil Persons, and the Way of the Tempter as much as possible, that from their Youth they may be taught the holy Scripture, and a great Reverence for GOD, and them.—It concerns you to seek earnestly to GOD for the out-pouring of his Spirit on the present and rising Generation. Will you <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it on your Lees, and leave your Families to their own Course, to catch the Notions and Principles, and learn the Practices of the World? With what Views can you do thus? With a Pretence of trusting them with GOD and their

own Reason when they grow up? Is not this to tempt GOD, while you excuse yourselves from discharging one of the most important Trusts GOD has committed to you? and putting your Children from under one of the most solemn Institutions which he has ordained, to bring them into the Way of Conversion and Salvation? and to leave their Tuition to the Devil, and their own depraved Hearts?—<HI>Deut.</HI> 6.6, 7. <HI>And these Words which I command thee this Day, shall be in thine Heart; and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy Children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine House, and when thou walkest by the Way, when thou sittest down, and when thou risest up, &amp;c.</HI> The sad Prospect for the suc∣ceeding Generation, and the Condition the Church and Society seems sinking into, may make our Eyes run down with Tears, and our Hearts bleed with Anguish for the Hurt of the Daughter of our People. And we are taught our Duty, <HI>Isa.</HI> 6.2, 10. <HI>Keep not Silence, give him no Rest, 'till he shall establish, 'till he make this Church and People a Praise in the whole Earth.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. I WOULD excite all to the Duties incum∣bent on us, agreeable to the Subject of my Dis∣course.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="013083_0033_0F8EBDDC67B1B670"/>I AM persuaded there is not a Person here, but wishes to be happy; and I suppose no one thinks he has already attained it. You wish the Prosperity of your Children, and their Posterity. You have generally shewn a vehement Desire to be free, to enjoy the Rights and Privileges of Englishmen; and of enjoying the Liberty of wor∣shipping GOD according to your Consciences, an uninterrupted Liberty of Gospel Ordinances: that Liberty in which CHRIST has made his People free. <HI>You desire Life, and love many Days, that you may see Good.</HI> You wish to be happy in another World, when you leave this; but I doubt whether the most of you are taking the right Way to this Prosperity and Happiness.— And as I would now give you the best Advice I can, I must consider you all as Believers, or Unbelievers; as in a corrupt unsanctified State, or as regenerate and renewed by the Holy Ghost. This Distinction divides the World, be their out∣ward Condition whatever it may.</P>
<P>LET me then speak, First, to those who are in a carnal, unregenerate, unconverted State.— As long as you remain such, 'tis impossible you should be happy in this World, or the next: In this State you are under the Guilt and Power of Sin, and the Curse of GOD's Law, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.10. If you are grown up, and grown old in this
<PB N="36" REF="013083_0034_0F8EBDE0D0A3FAB0"/>
Condition, your Case is dismal, and extremely dangerous, but not yet hopeless. Now the best Advice I can give you, is what the Apostle gave the Jailor, <HI>Acts</HI> 16.31. <HI>Believe on the LORD JESUS CHRIST, and thou shalt be saved.</HI> Every other Hope in the World you must renounce. There is not the least Crevice of Hope from the Covenant of Works: That was broke by Adam, and not one of his Posterity ever was, or will be justified by that: It has never since been propounded to Man, as a Way of his Jus∣tification. <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.20. <HI>Therefore by the Deeds of the Law, there shall no Flesh be justified in his Sight.</HI> 'Tis by Faith in CHRIST only, that you ever can or will be justified: Upon him and his Righteousness you must entirely depend, upon the Promise and Credit of the Gospel. You must be recovered from the Love of the World and of Sin, truly hate and repent of it all: Supremely love GOD and Holiness, and live a Life of new Obedience. Cry to GOD without ceasing, to give you this Grace; to translate you out of the Kingdom of Darkness, into the Kingdom of his dear Son. If you obtain this Blessing, you will have the best Foundation for Happiness; the best Prospect and Hope of Life: But if you do not, you will die in your Sins, and die eter∣nally.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="37" REF="013083_0035_0F8EBDE1C1E3BBF0"/>2. TO those who are Believers, and sanctified by Faith that is in CHRIST JESUS.—I trust, through the Grace of GOD, there are a Num∣ber of such here. If that be our happy Case, we must notwithstanding say with the Apostle, <HI>We have not yet attained, nor are we already per∣fect.</HI> We are yet in a corrupt, evil and sinful World; compassed with many Infirmities. Alas, how poorly, how faintly struggling against our Enemies? How weak is our Faith, how distant from those Attainments we ought to have had, and to which some have attained? Our Business, my Brethren, is to press toward the Mark for the Prize of the high-Calling which is of GOD in CHRIST JESUS our LORD. Labour to grow in Grace and abound in Holiness, to devote the Remainder of our Lives to GOD, in a more un∣divided Manner than we have ever done. The Time is short; and as we hope to receive a Reward through Grace according to our Works, we should grow more spiritual and heavenly-minded. The Vigor and Activity of our Bodies will more and more decay; but let the inward Man be renewed Day by Day. We should labour that by Grace we may abound in Humility, Meekness, Patience, Long-Suffering, Weanedness fro<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> World; in Converse with GOD and Heaven. Live daily upon GOD and CHRIST, open our Mouths wide and he will fill them. The nearer we come
<PB N="38" REF="013083_0036_0F8EBDE2EE654220"/>
to the End of Days, 'tis fit we should be of a more heavenly Temper, that our Hearts be more form'd to the Exercises and Business of the Spirits made perfect.</P>
<P>LET the Churches, and the World be the better for our Example, Counsels and Prayers; the Fruits of which may be poured upon them after you are gone to join the Church triumphant, and feel the Life and Joys of Heaven diffused through all your Souls.</P>
<P>LET me endeavor once more to persuade you, the dear People of this Society, and all Persons here present, that the surest, best, the only Way to attain the greatest Happiness in this Life, and the Peace and Privileges you wish for yourselves, and your Posterity; the Way to leave them the fairest Inheritance, and to be forever happy, is <HI>Holiness, or the true real Religion of the Gospel.</HI>— This has a natural and powerful Tendency to promote the Happiness of all Churches, all Soci∣eties, and particular Persons, to as great a Degree as can be had in a World of Sin and Trial. It is the Way which GOD, the Author of all Good and Happiness, has constituted to bring sinful Men to Happiness in this World and the next. If you try all other Ways you can devise to lengthen out your Privileges, and promote your Prosperity, and
<PB N="39" REF="013083_0037_0F8EBDE350AF1A58"/>
make you happy; try them as much as you please and as long as you can, they never will give you Peace and Serenity in your own Minds, they will never give you Satisfaction in their Fruition, they will not lead your Posterity to Rest, nor give Rest to your own Souls. If I had Ten-fold, or Ten Thousand-fold the Strength, and Powers I have, I would willingly employ and spend them all to dissuade you from those Ways of seeking your Happiness. If I knew this was the last Sermon I should ever preach, (and I know not but it may) I would chuse to employ it to recommend, and to persuade you to make Choice of GOD for your Portion, CHRIST for your only and all-sufficient Saviour, and Holiness and Virtue, or Conformity to the moral Image of GOD, as the only Happiness of rational Creatures.</P>
<P>WHETHER you continue together, or be divi∣ded from one another, as my last and most ear∣nest Wish for you, I would wish you to be hear∣tily persuaded, that the Religion of the Gospel, the Holiness, Virtue, Benevolence, which that teaches and prescribes, is the Sum of all Duty, the best Policy, the surest Means to make you great and honorable in the Eyes of GOD, Angels, and all good Men; to make you prosperous, and truly happy.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="013083_0038_0F8EBDE3EA1D95F0"/>I DARE assure you in the Name of GOD, and as a Minister of CHRIST, that the more religi∣ously you maintain, and attend to the Institutions of the Gospel, and practice the Virtues of it, the more Ground of Hope there will be, that you and your Posterity will be as happy as you can rea∣sonably wish in this World, and blessed with GOD in that to come.</P>
<P>BUT the more Religion dies out and dwindles away from among you, the more contemptible, mean, distracted, wretched and accursed People will you be.—And now, Brethren, I commend you to GOD, and to the Word of his Grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an Inheritance among all them that are sanctified. AMEN.</P>
