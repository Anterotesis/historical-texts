<P>THE following Sermon owes its Publicat<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tirely to some of the Auditors, who were <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> when it was deliver'd from the Pulpit, and had such an Opinion of its Merit, as to solicit the Author for a Copy to be published at their own Expence and Risk. He has kindly granted the Request: And as the Publishers think the Discourse strikingly plain, sensi∣ble and manly, composed by the Author with deep At∣tention to the Subject, a clear and strong Persuasion of the Truth and Importance of the Sentiments he expressed, sincerely and piously intended, and judici∣ously calculated to evince some of the great fundamental Truths of Christianity in Opposition to the Cavils of ig∣norant or designing Men,—It is hoped the Publicati∣on—tho' it cannot convey the Sentiments with that unaffected Warmth and Propriety of Emphasis, with which they flow'd from the Preacher's Heart to those of his Audience,—yet it is the sincere Desire of the Publishers, that it may afford as much Pleasure and Advantage to the Reader, as it gave to every atten∣tive, well disposed Hearer who received it from the Mouth of the Author.</P>
<P>Tho' much has been said and written upon this Subject before, yet some of the Arguments in the fol∣lowing Discourse have not only their <HI>Weight</HI> but their <HI>Novelty</HI> to recommend them—and it may be said with Propriety that <HI>they are</HI> Old Truths <HI>set in a</HI> new Light: At least the Evidence of the Facts, is put in a Light that to the Publishers was entirely new and convincing, and they trust will be so to every Reader who desires to know the Truth, and act conformably to it.</P>

<Q><BIBL>HEBREWS, Chap. 1. V. 1.2.</BIBL>
<P>God who at sundry Times, and in divers Manners, spake in Time past unto the Fathers by the Prophets, Hath in these last Days spoken unto us by his Son.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Words I have now read to you, shew the Apostle, the Author of them, to be a com∣plete Divine, as well as a perfect Master of Address.</P>
<P>You all know, this Epistle out of which the Text is taken, was written to the Hebrews, who acknowledged, that God had revealed himself to that Nation, by Moses and the Prophets. But then many of them denied that God had spoken to them by his Son Jesus Christ: In order to rectify this Error, the Apostle in the Beginning of the Epistle, asserts a Fact which was necessary to be believed by all the Jewish Nation; as he was now ordered by God, to abolish all the Jewish Rites, which as yet had not been done by any Revelation from Heaven: and the Jews were bound to obey the Law given from Heaven, 'til such Time, as that Law was set aside by the same Authority which gave it at first.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the Year 52— We find in Acts 15—that the Gentile Chris∣tians, were orderd to abstain from Meats offered to Idols, from Blood, from Things strangled, and from Fornication. But it does not appear that the Jews were exempted from observing the Law of Moses, till the Year 64—they were to observe the Law of Moses, together with the Laws of Christ, till they received an Order from Heaven to set aside the old Law. This was the Difference between the Jewish and Gentile Christians, till this Epistle to the Hebrews was written.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the Epistle to the Hebrews the Apostle allows what the Jews contended for, that God had revealed himself, not only to the Jews, but to many, even before Moses.
<PB N="2" REF="012428_0005_0F89985078FF4348"/>
At <HI>Sundry Times</HI> God acquainted the World, that the Soul was immortal; by Enoch, by Noah, before the Flood: and Abraham <HI>taught his Children the Commandments of the Lord,</HI> after the Flood. And Jacob, <HI>by prophecying to his Sons of Things to come,</HI> shewed that he had a Revelation from Heaven. Then, Moses taught the Children of Is∣rael during their Pilgrimage through the wilderness. And after they came into the Holy Land, they were taught by Deborah, Samuel, and the other Prophets, in the Time of the Judges. By Nathan, in the Time of David and Solomon. And by Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel; in the Time of the Kings. By Daniel, Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi, in, and after the Captivity.</P>
<P>And these Revelations were made to them <HI>in divers Manners</HI>; that is, sometimes in a Cloud, sometimes in a Fire sometimes in a still small Voice; at other Times, by Visions, Dreams, and a Voice from between the Cheru∣bims: and by the holy Spirit speaking in the Prophets.</P>
<P>As sure as God had taught the people in these various Ways, and Methods, so sure it was, that the same God now taught them by his Son Jesus Christ, who was the very Person, to whom all the former Dispensations di∣rectly pointed.</P>
<P>Before the Time of Moses, Mankind were taught by Tradition of what had been revealed, and by immediate Revelations. After Moses, they were taught partly by written Revelation, and partly by the Dispensation they were under; and partly by Prophets and holy Persons, who were inspired to teach them in those Points in which, their written Revelation was deficient, or imperfect.</P>
<P>Accordingly the Will of Heaven, was exhibited in these Periods of the Church of God, in various Ways, and different Methods. But after Christ came, the whole Scheme of our Redemption by a crucified Saviour was re∣vealed, and all committed to writing, by which, all Chris∣tians are to regulate their Faith and Practice. Now, all the <HI>Evidence</HI> for their Faith, and all the <HI>Rules</HI> for their
<PB N="3" REF="012428_0006_0F8998512F3FE6C8"/>
Conduct, are to be found in the sacred Volume. There fore we read, That <HI>Christ brought Life, and Immortality to Light through the Gospel.</HI> (2 Epistle to Timothy 1.10) This Expression, is not to be understood as if the Doctrine of the immortality of the Soul, was not believed before Christ came; but only to intimate, that all the Evidences for it, were not contained in the written Rules given to the Jews. The Prophets were to teach the Jews in many Things not contained in the written Law, saying, <HI>know the</HI> Lord in <HI>this,</HI> and <HI>other particulars</HI>; but under the Dispen∣sation of the Mesiah, <HI>All shall know him from the greatest to the least.</HI> That is, all the Evidences for Christianity, for the Immortality of the Soul, and for our Conduct as Christians, are contained in the Gospel of Jesus Christ. There we may be fully acquainted, how we were re∣deemed, that the Divine Assistance is afforded to all who seek for it, to help them to find out the Truth; and after they have found it, to enable them to practise all Gospel Obedience, which will qualify the Soul to enjoy the Happiness of Heaven: and that Christ will intercede in Right of his own Merits, that all who have believed in him, and acknowledged him as their Lord and Master, and obeyed his Laws, shall be put in possession of that Degree of Happiness, of which, their Gospel Obedi∣ence has rendered them fit to be Partakers.</P>
<P>The Apostle, in the Text, takes it for granted, that God was the Author of several former Dispensations; and I shall do the same now,—and only exhibit the Proof that the Christian Religion came from God, with all the Evi∣dence, that the Importance of the Case required.</P>
<P>Neither the Time allowed me, nor your Patience will admit that I should mention all the Evidences contained in the Scriptures, as a Proof, that the Christian Religion came from God. Therefore, I shall, at this Time, insist upon only one single Evidence, out of many,—that is, the Resurrection of Christ, as a full Proof in the Case. If the Resurrection is proved by incontestable Evidence, then
<PB N="4" REF="012428_0007_0F899852D0ED2140"/>
the Christian Religion must have come from God: If that cannot be proved, all the Evidences must be deem∣ed insignificant. <HI>If Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your Faith is also vain,</HI> (1 Corinthians 15.14.</P>
<P>The Resurrection of Christ is a Matter of Fact,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Every rational Being is as good a Judge of a Matter of Fact, as the greatest Man upon Earth.</NOTE> said to be done upwards of seventeen Hundred Years ago: therefore the Evidence for this Fact must be taken from the Historians of that Age, in which, it is said Christ arose from the Dead.</P>
<P>Let only the same Credit be given to the Authors of the New Testament, that is allowed to other Historians of that Age in which they lived, and the Matter is put out of all Dispute.</P>
<P>Friends and Enemies all agree that Christ was dead be∣fore he was taken down from the Cross. Pilate did not consent that Christ should be taken from the Cross till he was sure that he was dead: The Soldiers did not take him down from the Cross, till they had <HI>with a Spear pierced his Side, and forthwith came thereout Blood and wa∣ter.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">There is no Water in that Part of the Body, but what is con∣tained in the Pericardium; if that is broken it is instant Death.</NOTE> (John 19.34.)</P>
<P>Thus it appears that Christ was dead; let us see if there is any Evidence that he was alive after this. For the Evidence of this, we must have recourse to the Histo∣rians of that Age.</P>
<P>The eleven Apostles declare, that they saw and con∣versed with Christ after he rose from the Dead, at several Times, within forty Days after he rose. Not only so, but he appointed the Time when, and the Place where he would appear to them.</P>
<P>And 'tis also affirmed, that five Hundred Persons saw him at one Time, after he rose from the Dead.</P>
<P>The Apostles upon all Opportunities declare that they were Witnesses of his resurrection; and they affirmed this, at the Peril of their Lives.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="012428_0008_0F899853CF27CA90"/>If this was not true; the Conduct of the Apostles can∣not be accounted for, upon any rational Footing. For there was no <HI>Advantage</HI> could arise to them in <HI>this</HI> World, but much <HI>Distress,</HI> and <HI>Danger,</HI> for asserting what they did. And as to the other World, for they believed the Immortality of the Soul, they must expect nothing but Punishment, if they persisted in declaring that to be true, which they knew to be absolutely false.</P>
<P>Let the Conduct of the Apostles be ever so unaccount∣able, in asserting that Christ was risen from the Dead; yet if there are other Historians, of equal Character with them, who lived at the Time when it was said, that Christ rose from the Dead, and declare that he did not rise; and that they could produce Numbers besides themselves, who saw his Body liveless and unanimated, lying in the Market at Jerusalem, at various Times for forty Days; and not only so, but five Hundred People saw it there, in this lifeless State, at one Time; and that the greatest Part of these People were alive when these Historians asserted these Facts, and that they died for asserting of them: Were this the Case, it would greatly weaken the Apostles' Evi∣dence in the Matter of the Resurrection. That is, if we consider the Apostles' Evidence as only human, as I do for the present, this contrary Evidence would go near to de∣stroy what had been affirmed by the Apostles.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is allowed that the <HI>onus probandi,</HI> lies on the affirmative Side of the Question: Yet it is but just to call for Evidence hereof from the other Side; as it was in the Power of those who denied the Resur∣rection, to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a positive Proof, by producing the Body of Christ if he was not risen.</NOTE> But is this the Case? Is there so much as one Historian, who asserts that he saw the Body of Christ dead, after the Apos∣tles declare it to be alive? Were not the Jews and Ro∣mans as much concerned to prove the Falsehood of the Apostles in this point, as they were to support their own Characters? Were they not warned beforehand, that Christ had said he should rise the third Day? Did they
<PB N="6" REF="012428_0009_0F899854313E1FF8"/>
not upon this Information take the Charge of the Body of Christ, after it was laid in the Tomb,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As the Tomb was cut out of a solid Rock, there was but one Way for the Body to come out; so it was easy to guard it and pre∣vent any Cheat in the Case.</NOTE> in order, to prevent any publick Deception? If the Body was gone, were not they who took the Charge of it, answerable for it to the Publick?</P>
<P>All Power, civil and military, was in the Hands of the Jews and Romans, at that Time. They could easily have confuted the Apostles, if what they asserted was not true. The Magistrates could have searched and ransacked every Corner in the whole City.</P>
<P>But there was no Need of so great a Search as this; for if his Body was left in the Hands of any, except Christi∣ans, they would readily deliver it up, in order to expose the Cheat. Accordingly if the Body was in Jerusalem in a lifeless State, it might easily have been found, and no doubt would have been found, and laid in open View to all the Inhabitants of the whole City.</P>
<P>If this had been done, it might have put an End, to all the Apostles had to offer in the Case. Men would have seen with their own Eyes, that the Fact which the Apos∣tles asserted, was all at the very best, but a mere Delusion.</P>
<P>Was this done? Or was it even attempted to be done? No! And what Reason can be given why they did not attempt it? Only this—that they were conscious Christ was risen, and they could not produce his Body to the People. Otherwise they would certainly have taken this Method, and stifled the Error, if it was an Error, even in its very Birth</P>
<P>If they had searched for the Body and found it, this would have had the Effect, to have entirely esta∣blished the Prudence and Sagacity of the Enemies of the Christian Religion, and confounded all those who pre∣tended to believe it.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="012428_0010_0F899854EFCBCF30"/>But this they could not do: his Body was not to be found by them. It could not be detained even by Death, nor all the Powers of Darkness, for <HI>it was not possible it could be holden by them.</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps it may be asked by some, why Christ did not appear to the Unbelievers; and convince them, that he was risen from the Dead;</P>
<P>I answer, that he did appear to some; for it is not reasonable to suppose, that all the five Hundred Persons to whom he appeared were Believers, before he ap∣peared to them. And we are absolutely certain that St. Paul was an Unbeliever till after Christ appeared unto him.</P>
<P>Indeed none of the <HI>Apostles</HI> believed the Article of the Resurrection, as one of the Characters of the Messiah, till after he appeared to them. When the Women told them that Christ was risen, <HI>it seemed to them as idle Tales,</HI> and <HI>they believed them not.</HI> When the two Disciples told them that he was risen, and they had seen him, the Apos∣tles <HI>believed it not.</HI> Thomas absolutely refused to believe the Apostles, in this Point, till he should be convinced by his own Senses.</P>
<P>Indeed it appears, that not one of his Disciples believed that he was to rise from the Dead, till after he appeared to them. But then, they immediately became Witnesses to the World, that he was risen from the Dead. Those that were <HI>best</HI> acquainted with his Person before he suf∣fered, were the <HI>fittest</HI> Persons for Witnesses of his Resur∣rection: and no others were qualified to be Witnesses in the Case. For if they did not know him <HI>before he died,</HI> how could they know him <HI>after he was risen</HI>? Accord∣ingly, his Disciples were the best qualified to be Judges in the Case.</P>
<P>And besides all this: God is the proper Judge of his own Dispensations, and best knows what Evidence, is most likely to prove effectual to produce a Belief in Mankind: and therefore hath given that Evidence in Scripture, which
<PB N="8" REF="012428_0011_0F899855B1026300"/>
is most powerful to bring us to a Belief of the Truth.</P>
<P>It may be asked, why there is not some Miracle wrought in every Age, and Country to convince People of the Truth of Christianity?</P>
<P>I answer, the very Thing desired, God has been pleased to do. Perhaps, there is not a Government upon Earth, where there is not a Jew to testify the Truth of the Christian Religion. Every Jew we behold is a Miracle; for nothing less than the Divine Interposition in a mira∣culous Way, could have preserved that Nation distinct, when they lived amidst all other Nations; detested and persecuted by them for seventeen Hundred Years.</P>
<P>Where are the ancient Romans now? Can any Man point out the Descendants of that once numerous and po∣tent People? And yet that Nation was in the Meridian of its Glory, at the Time, when the Jews were dispersed among all Nations. But to return,</P>
<P>The Evidence of the Resurrection of Christ, which proves that God hath spoken to us by his Son, or given a new Dispensation under the Government of the Messiah, is so clear and evident, that we must renounce the very Faculty of Credibility, and all Faith in History, before we can set aside the Evidence which God hath given for the Truth of the Christian Religion.</P>
<P>All the Evidence is on the Side of Christianity, there is none on the other. Though the Enemies to Christianity have ransacked all the Records of Time, they cannot pro∣duce so much as one Man, that has said he saw the Body of Christ confined under the Power of Death, after the Apostles declare he was risen from the Dead. Is it possi∣ble then, that Men who make Evidence the Standard of their Belief, should hesitate a Moment about the Truth of Christianity? There is sufficient Evidence offered in the Scripture, for the Truth of the Christian Religion, to <HI>satisfy</HI> a rational Enquiry, whatever it may be to <HI>silence</HI> a useless Curiosity.</P>
<P>The true State of the Case lies thus: The eleven
<PB N="9" REF="012428_0012_0F89985670BCF590"/>
Apostles declare at the Hazard of their Lives, and died for asserting of it, that Christ rose from the Dead. They declare that they <HI>saw</HI> him, <HI>handled</HI> him, and <HI>eat</HI> with him, after he <HI>died,</HI> and <HI>rose from the Dead.</HI></P>
<P>On the other Side, there is not the least distant Hint given by any Historian, even of the lowest Character, that any Person saw the Body of Christ dead, after the Time, that the Apostles declare that he was risen.</P>
<P>Now which Man acts the most consistent with the Cha∣racter of a rational Being,— he who believes eleven Men, who assert a Matter of Fact, that they were Ear and Eye Witnesses of; or he who refuses his Belief? And yet there is not one Person who asserts the Contrary to be true, that is, not one Person who though he had it in his <HI>Will</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> to detect the Error, were it an Error, that ever has said the least Thing that could invalidate the Evidence, the Apostles have laid before the World.</P>
<P>If Men will be determined by plain Evidence in the Case, they must embrace Christianity; for it is true, that Christ rose from the Dead; it is also true, that he has given us a Religion which we <HI>ought</HI> and are <HI>bound</HI> to be∣lieve and practise.</P>
<P>I have laid the Evidence before you, to prove that Christ rose from the Dead; and till such Time, as that a Number of Historians, of equal Character with the Apostles, can be produced, that saw his Body dead, after the Time the Apostles declare it to be alive; the Evidence in favour of Christianity is so clear, that no Man who makes Evidence the Basis of his Conduct, can possibly withhold his Assent to the Truth of our most holy Reli∣gion.</P>
<P>I suppose there is not one present, that is willing to be governed by any Thing that is unreasonable; that is to say, if sufficient Evidence is laid before you, you will give your Assent accordingly.</P>
<P>In the Case of Christianity, you see, that the Evidence is clear, and easy to be found. And consequently, that
<PB N="10" REF="012428_0013_0F899857300814E0"/>
our Belief is rational and and manly; founded upon such Motives as we are able to justify, before God and Man.</P>
<P>The next Thing, after we believe the Record which God has given of his Son, is sincerely to take the Profes∣sion of Christianity upon us, according as Christ has com∣manded; then to regulate our Lives by that Law, which our Saviour who rose from the Dead, hath given for a Rule for his Church in every changing Scene in this in∣constant World.</P>
<P>In order, that we may make a right Use of the Advan∣tages we enjoy by a Gospel Revelation; let us set an high Value on the holy Scriptures, and make them the <HI>sole Rule</HI> of our <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Practice.</HI> They contain the whole Evidence of our Religion, and all that Christ <HI>has done, is doing,</HI> and <HI>will do for his Church,</HI> together with the whole that Christ requires us to do for ourselves, with that Assistance he has purchased for us, and bestows upon all those who sincerely seek for it, in the Ways of his Appointment.</P>
<P>If we would form a just Notion of Christianity, free from all the Corruptions which were brought into it by designing Men, we must make the Study of the Scriptures a Part of our Religion. It would have been very happy for the Christian Church, if they had made the Scrip∣tures all along the Rule of their Conduct. Then they would not have fallen into those gross Corruptions in Doctrine, Worship, and Discipline, which have caused such unchristian Divisions in the Church, which have cre∣ated much Coldness in Religion. However, these Errors cannot be charged to our Religion, as contained in the Bible; if we forsake the Scriptures for a mere Whim of Men's distempered Brains, we must expect to embrace Ab∣surdity. But if we take the Evidence for Christianity from the Scripture, we are always safe; for our Faith then will not be changed according to the Fashions of the Times, but be placed and <HI>built upon the Foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief Corner Stone.</HI> (Ephesians 2, 20.)</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="012428_0014_0F899857EFA7A948"/>Christians who adhere to a written Revelation, have this Advantage, that by impartially consulting it, the Deviations from it may be detected, and their Religion be brought back to its original Standard.</P>
<P>Are we in doubt concerning the Truth of Christianity? The Scriptures contain that Evidence in Favour of it, which is convincing to every Man▪ who is determined by the Force of Evidence.</P>
<P>Are we in doubt about any Doctrine? The Scriptures are clear, as to all Points of Doctrine that were designed for this Period of the Church.</P>
<P>Are we at a Loss what was the antient Discipline of the Church? The Scriptures will inform us exactly, how the Apostles governed the Church in their Time; toge∣ther with the Laws how the Church is to be governed to the Consummation of all Things.</P>
<P>Are we under deep Concern to find out what is our Du∣ty? Open your Bible; there you may find it, in legible Characters.</P>
<P>Are we sensible we are Sinners, and have thereby lost all Intercourse with the pure and holy Father of the Uni∣verse? The Scriptures acquaint us, <HI>That we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous; and he is the Propitiation for our Sins.</HI> (1 John 2.1, 2.) That though we are Sinners, yet we may obtain Pardon and Mercy upon the Gospel Offer; that our Religion is a Re∣ligion of <HI>Mercy,</HI> not of <HI>Merit</HI> in us: and accordingly we may be accepted through the Merits of Christ, if we re∣pent.</P>
<P>Are we under Trouble and Affliction of any Kind? The Scriptures are a sovereign Remedy to allay our Grief; for they acquaint us, that God puts under, his everlasting Arms, to support the Feeble, and holds out his Mercy to encourage the desponding Soul, and alleviate the Grief of the Mourner.</P>
<P>Are we groaning under a Load of Infamy, because our Characters are unjustly taken from us? The Scriptures
<PB N="12" REF="012428_0015_0F899858AF30F690"/>
inform us, that it will not be long to the Time, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> shall appear before the Tribunal of Heaven and Ear<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and then our Characters will appear in their true, ge∣nuine Colours.</P>
<P>Are we labouring under any bodily Pain or Sickness? The Scriptures assure us, that after a little Time, we shall be possessed of a Resurrection Body, in which, there will be no Pain or Sickness. For as Christ rose from the Dead, being the first Fruits from the Dead, so will he also <HI>raise us from the Dead.</HI> I shall conclude this Discourse by lay∣ing open the human Heart in all its Windings, Disguises, and Corruptions.</P>
<P>To accomplish this Design effectually, I must make a solemn Appeal to the Conscience of each individual Soul here present, to sit as Judge in this Affair. The Rule, by which, you are to judge, <HI>is the Word of the ever-living God.</HI> The Things you are to pass Judgment upon, are your own inward <HI>Characters, Principles, Springs of Action, and Conduct in Life.</HI> No human Creature besides your∣self, can pass a just Sentence in the Case. And yet it is of infinite Concern to you that such a Judgment be formed. The habitual Tenor of your Life must be carefully exa∣mined: your Conduct must be arraigned, interrogated, and tried by the sacred Rule of God's Word. In Conse∣quence of this, you will stand condemned, or acquitted, not by him that now speaks to you, but by one who is infi∣nitely better qualified to judge in this Matter; even by a Sentence which you have passed upon yourself, having the <HI>Word of God</HI> in <HI>one Hand,</HI> and a <HI>true Knowledge of your own Heart,</HI> in the <HI>other.</HI></P>
<P>Who is there, that believes future Rewards and Pu∣nishments, can stand by, as an unconcerned Spectator, when Things of such infinite Moment await him? Are you fit for Heaven, or are you not? Or have you never made any inquiry about it? If you have not, how is it possible you can be easy one Moment? Do you not be∣lieve there is a Day coming, how soon you know not,
<PB REF="012428_0016_0F89985A51E0E780"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> before the Bar of God's Judgment seat? In this Process all the Angels of Hea∣ven, and all the Men that ever were upon the Earth, will be present. I shall see you all there; and may I see you at the Right Hand of the blessed Jesus, shouting forth Praises for the Mercies of Redeeming Love. In that Day, we shall <HI>all</HI> hear the Sentence pronounced upon us, which will put us in Possession of everlasting Bliss, or consign us over to eternal Woe.</P>
<P>At this Tribunal the Conduct of every Soul will be tried by the Word of God. They who have made the Scriptures the Rule of their Life, and thereby are quali∣fied to enjoy the State of the Blessed, will by the Merits of Christ, hear this enravishing Sentence pronounced upon them, <HI>Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you.</HI></P>
