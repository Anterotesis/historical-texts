</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Life of man in this pre∣sent world is celebrated by many Masters of Morality among the Heathen, under the notion of a <HI>Warfare:</HI> but <HI>these</HI> were never able by their most exalted Theories to state the true nature, or pre∣scribe the just rules for the successful dis∣charge hereof: For after all their Essayes, the undisciplined Combatant will need dire∣ction; and the saint hearted, encouragement in the day of Battel. But now Christianity
<PB N="2" REF="001016_0003_0FAEEDAC1C6D82F8"/>
does supply all these defects: This gives us a more exalted notion of this <HI>Warfare;</HI> and lays down the best rules for the conduct of the Christian Souldier from his first Entring the <HI>Line of Battel,</HI> till death shall raise the <HI>Camp,</HI> and give him a <HI>discharge.</HI> Here the Conduct and Prowess of the General, under whose Banner he is to fight, is displayed; the power and policy of those Enemies, which he is to agonize and conflict with, is laid open; the good cause, in which he is to Engage, discovered; and the glorious prae∣mium, or prize, which he is to contend for, is set forth, and assured to the Victor; a Prize sufficient to inspire every breast that has the best sense of true honour, with all the Essentials of an heroical resolution, and unbroken courage.</P>
<P>How a Soul shall discharge this Warfare, as becomes the honour of Christ his Leader, the goodness of the Cause, and the glory of the reward is a Quaery of no common im∣portance: The resolution of which in short is, that the faithful discharge hereof consists in a punctual observation of his <HI>Commanders Orders.</HI></P>
<P>These Orders are plainly and fully con∣tained in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Oracles of Truth, which if observed, the Combat will be crown¦ed with Victory, and the Victory end in an
<PB N="3" REF="001016_0004_0FAEEDAD81EAA190"/>
everlasting Triumph: Now these Orders are exceeding large; as extensive as the Law of God, which the Royal Prophet tells us, is exceeding broad: The latitude of which Or∣ders consists in their being adapted to all the Children of men under their various circum∣stances, and Employments. There is no post, station or profession but what they ex∣tend to, and afford conduct in: They reach the King on the Throne, and stoop to the Beggar on the Dunghill: They are directive, and obligatory to the Priest at the Altar, to the Judge on the Tribunal, and the Souldier in the Camp, and in all his preparations here for: So that by a faithful discharge of the duties of their respective posts on Chri∣stian Principles they will make glorious ad∣vances to the unshaken Kingdom of Eternal Light and Love.</P>
<P>Agreeable to all this, Christ, the Believers Commander, having withdrawn himself as to bodily presence from his <HI>Militant Camp</HI> on Earth, and being advanced to the head of his <HI>Triumphant Armies</HI> in Heaven; has in ad∣mirable wisdom Substituted an Order of men, to represent his Person, act in his name as Under Officers; and these stand obliged by the duties of their function to publish, explain and apply his Orders in their full extent and latitude. Hence it is the charact∣er
<PB N="4" REF="001016_0005_0FAEEDAD99673450"/>
of one <HI>wise</HI> and <HI>faithful</HI> in this sacred Order, to bring out or his Storehouse things new and old, and to give every one their portion in due season; and neither hopes nor fears are to move them from this duty of their charge. A Gospel Minister in the discharge of his Office, is not only to de∣clare the general duties of Christianity, which respect all in common, that are List∣ed under Christ Jesus; but as opportunity calls, to make a more close application of particular duties to men in their respective capacities; and to warn them against those temptations which endanger their welfare in their several Stations. When Christ's Ambassadors do thus, they are not to be trea∣ted as deserters of their proper charge; nor voted guilty of an usurpation, or an Invasion made on anothers Province: But it is to be accounted a specimen of that wisdom and fidelity, which become the character of <HI>Stew∣ards in Christs Houshold.</HI> A glorious instance of this prudence and faithfulness we have before us in <HI>John the Baptist,</HI> in his treatment of persons of divers Orders, agreeable to their several characters.</P>
<P>I shall not essay a critical Analysis of our Context. It shall <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in general to say: That when the fulness of time was almost come for the appearance of the Eternal Son

of God in humane nature; under which Veil he was to screen the insufferable brightness of his Divinity in order to the Redemption of his Chosen <HI>Israel</HI> according to the Everlasting Counsel or peace: how God was pleased to dispatch <HI>John the Baptist</HI> the promised <HI>Elias,</HI> as an Herald of the ap∣proaching Messias, as the Morning Star to usher in the Sun of Righteousness: This fore runner of Christ was authorized by his Doctrine and Baptism to prepare sinners of that day for the reception of this Prince of Peace. In order to this we find him Prea∣ching the Doctrine, and Administring the Baptism of Repentance: which he Enforces with the consideration <HI>that the Kingdom of God was at hand;</HI> and withal alarms his Au∣ditory with an awful prediction of Destru∣ction, if they refuse to comply with his Do∣ctrine: The success of which Dispensation we have an account of. Many of his Au∣ditors were awakened, brought to some se∣rious thought; so as to address him for fur∣ther direction. Thus we find many of the people, the Publicans, &amp; the Souldiers seek∣ing to the Baptist for further Instruction.</P>
<P>Our Text is the address made by men of Military Order. <HI>The Souldiers likewise de∣manded of him, saying, and what shall we do?</HI> In which we may observe,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="6" REF="001016_0007_0FAEEDAF173358A8"/>
1. <HI>The persons addressing;</HI> and they are <HI>Souldiers:</HI> These were the Roman Souldiers posted there to maintain <HI>Rome'</HI>s Conquest of <HI>Judea:</HI> An Order of men ordinarily too much devoted to blood, plunder, &amp; rapine: Too many of which chuse to fight in Satan's Camp; to march in his <HI>forlorn</HI> in the way to destruction; as if they were resolved to Storm the Kingdom of Darkness, and take it by violence.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>We may observe the person addrest to;</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>John the Baptist,</HI> for that is the antece∣dent to the Relative <HI>him</HI> in our Text: which intimates to us, that Christ's Ambassadors are proper persons to be consulted with, a∣bout matter of duty, by persons of all orders and degrees. The Priest's lips must preserve knowledge; and we are to ask the Law at his mouth.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>We may observe the address it self:</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>They demanded of him, saying, what shall we do?</HI> Which is as if they had said, Sir, we have heard your Doctrine of Repentance; we have observed the terrors of the Lord, which you have set in battel array against the impenitent; we apprehend our own danger; and we who are no better than bryars and thorns dread to confront <HI>Consu∣ming Fire:</HI> and since Repentance, and the fruits thereof are necessary to our Escape;
<PB N="7" REF="001016_0008_0FAEEDB228647058"/>
instruct us, O thou Man of God, how we may order our lives; and particularly in that Post that Divine Providence has placed us in, that we may escape the Wrath to come, and be prepared for the Kingdom of God.</P>
<P>From the words there are two Assertions which shall employ our present meditations.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="assertion">
<HEAD>Assertion I. That Military Men, or Souldiers, are an Order of men allowable and proper in a Christian State.</HEAD>
<P>This is a truth that every one, who is not blinded by prejudice, must assent to as in∣contestable: Who can dispute the lawfulness of this Order, that do but take a view of those principles, which the God of Nature has originally implanted in humanity; who do consider the History and Doctrine both of the Veiled and Unveiled Gospel; and withal observe the Dispensations of Divine Providence in the world? Yet this has been confronted by the strongest efforts of Wit, and Art: Thus it has been assaulted by <HI>So∣cinus,</HI> and the main body of the <HI>Racovian</HI> Rout, together with many giddy Enthusi∣asts, who listed under their Banner to defy and fight against the Truths of the <HI>Living God.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="001016_0009_0FAEEDB31557C2A8"/>
It must indeed be acknowledged that War to which Military men bear a relation, is an evil to be deprecated: The tragical Re∣cords of all Ages do speak in bloody chara∣cters what fearful desolation it makes: and this is given by some as a reason why in the Sacred Records the same word is sometimes used to signifie War, and Harvest: because in War men are reapt and mown down by the Sword; as Grass and Corn by the Scyth and Sickle. <HI>Every Battel,</HI> faith the Evange∣lical Prophet, <HI>is with confused noise, and gar∣ments rolled in blood. Isa. 9.5.</HI> But yet this does not argue that War is Subversive of Christianity; or that this Order of men, who are to transact in this affair is not to be allowed in Gospel Dayes: for Souldiers are not only allowable, but proper and necessa∣ry in a Christian State. To state and illust∣rate this Assertion, let us remark.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That there would have been no occasion for men of Military Order, had man retained his primitive integrity.</HI> This was not from the beginning. The Original State or Nature is not a state of War. Had the Divine I∣mage on man, which consisted in the inde∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ective rectitude of all his powers, remained in its created brightness; had not the glory of humane nature been sullyed by sin; there would have been no foundation for men of
<PB N="9" REF="001016_0010_0FAEEDB399426670"/>
a Military quality. There would have been no Armies to confront or guard against; no Passes to be forced; no Seiges to be raised; no Garrisons to be Storm'd Unblemished Innocency would have preserved mankind in perfect Amity. This Order therefore is consequent upon the Apostasy: Had not man deserted that Past God at first placed him in, turned <HI>Revolter;</HI> and put himself under a <HI>forreign jurisdiction;</HI> and jovn'd with the Rebel Host of Apostate Spirits in the cursed conspiracy against God; there would have been no <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, nor discord among men. Had not Sin drawn the <HI>flaming Sword</HI> of Divine Justice, men would never have drawn the Sword against one another: The whole Earth would have been a <HI>Sanctuary of Peace,</HI> whereas Sin has now made it an <HI>Aceldama,</HI> a field of blood, a Stage on which the most <HI>bloody Tragedies</HI> have been acted.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>Were the principles of Christianity fully en¦tertained and acted upon in the world, there would be no need of Military men.</HI> Peace among men is one blessing which the Gospel of peace naturally tends to introduce. The ho∣ly principles of our blessed Religion are ad∣mirably adapted to inspire men with a Ca∣tholick love and tenderness to each other: They tend to remove the causes of Wars and Contentions. The Gospel when entertained
<PB N="10" REF="001016_0011_0FAEEDB460B87700"/>
gives check to mens malicious lusts, regulates and controuls their exorbitant passions: and <HI>these are they that draw the Sword,</HI> Jam. 4 1. <HI>From whence come wars, and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts, that war in your members?</HI> The blessed rules of Christ observed will mortify the inordinate Ambition of aspiring Monarchs, they will keep them from transgressing the boundaries of <HI>just</HI> and <HI>good,</HI> to enlarge their Territories, advance their Empire, and satiate their hellish Pride, to which whole Kingdoms many times fall devoted Victims. Were the perfect law of liberty universally and practically received as man's only Direction, that Prophesy would have a litteral accomplishment, <HI>Isa.</HI> 2. 4 <HI>They shall beat their Swords into plow shares, and their Spears into pruning books; Nation shall not lift up sword against nation; nor shall any learn War any more.</HI> We should be continually enter∣tained with the soft Airs of Zion's pleasant Songs of Peace; and never be started with the sound of the Trumpet, &amp; the alarm to War: <HI>The whole earth would be a Jerusa∣lem; a vision of Peace.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. This <HI>notwithstanding the Publick weal re∣quires such an order of men in a Christian state; &amp; consequently they are by the rules of Christianity allowable and proper.</HI> The Gospel has not obtained such full entertainment in the world,
<PB N="11" REF="001016_0012_0FAEEDB516CF9598"/>
as to make <HI>Wars to cease on the Earth.</HI> A Christian state is exposed to the insults and outrages of the sons of Violence: and this violence is to be repelled by men expert in martial accomplishments. It is high handed presumption for a Christian people to depend on God, by the miraculous interposition of his Providence, to shield them from ruin, while they neglect the proper means for their own security: For though God can, and some∣times do's save, without, nay contrary to means, yet his ordinary and stated way is to appear by his blessing on means for the Sal∣vation of his Israel. Hence according to the ordinary Series of Providence, it is many times impossible for a People to maintain Peace at home, secure their Civil and Sacred Liberties from the invasion &amp; incroachments of unreasonable men, unless the Sword be drawn. The publick tranquillity sometimes makes a War eligible: It is indeed a devour∣er, <HI>but out of that eater meat will come forth.</HI> <Q>At certain Times the Publick Calamities (as one sayes) are of that nature, that <HI>pre∣parations of Steel</HI> are found to be the most succesful Antidotes:</Q> and there is no possibi∣lity of curing these maladies but by these <HI>Chaly beates:</HI> Now Military men are necessary to apply this remedy to a sick &amp; languishing State: Hence by the Law of self preservati∣on,
<PB N="12" REF="001016_0013_0FAEEDB5E9F783D8"/>
on, that fundamental Law of humane na∣ture, such an Order of men are to be upheld in a Christian Common Wealth: And if natural principles oblige hereto, Christiani∣ty will not prohibit it: Christianity does not subvert any of Natures Laws; but con∣firm and exalt them. Souldiers therefore being a proper medium to a laudable End, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the publick good, it must be allowed the approbation of the true Religion, and of a duly regulated Conscience: There is no prohibition in Scripture against a Military Profession: were there; Why did not the Baptist disband the Souldiers in our Text? Why did not our Lord and Master deplume the Centurion that came to him? Why did he not command him to lay down his <HI>Com∣mission,</HI> as inconsistent with that <HI>faith,</HI> which in <HI>Israel</HI> it self, had not its <HI>parallel?</HI> In a word, Why in Scripture are Monuments E∣rected in honour of such as have been re∣markable for their Martial Atchievements; their names mentioned with the character of honour; by which they are consecrated to Posterity? By all which the Assertion before us is fixed as a <HI>principle</HI> readily to be granted, rather than a <HI>problem,</HI> to be disputed. We pass to the second Assertion, which challen∣ges our thoughts, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="assertion">
<PB N="13" REF="001016_0014_0FAEEDBAE521B8D8"/>
<HEAD>Assertion II. That there are Duties incumbent on Souldiers, which Christianity obliges and encourages them to the discharge of.</HEAD>
<P>Designed brevity will permit me only to give a resolution to this Enquiry, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P><HI>What are those duties which Christianity does oblige &amp; encourage Souldiers to the discharge of?</HI></P>
<P>And here, I shall not insist on those du∣ties, which are not only incumbent on Soul∣diers, but also on all in common, who are Entred into Christ's Muster roll.</P>
<P>There is but one way that leads to the City of the Living God; and in that way both the Prince and Peasant, bond and free, both Gown, and Sword men, must <HI>Storm the Kingdom of Heaven, and take it by violence.</HI></P>
<P>But that my discourse may in some mea∣sure ly level to the occasion of the present day, I shall only consider the duties that our Religion obliges Souldiers unto, as <HI>such;</HI> which have an immediate aspect upon them in their Military Capacities. And that my thoughts here may be distinct, it seems not improper to distinguish between Souldiers only in preparation by their Military Exer∣cises for real Service; and such as are actu∣ally called to real Service, to jeopardise their lives in the high places of the field. It seems
<PB N="14" REF="001016_0015_0FAEEDBBDE3907B0"/>
to be no great decorum in treating Souldi∣ers at home, in peace, with the same address as is suited to those that are ingaged in War, actually confronting an insolent Adversary. Here then we may essay a short account of the duties, which by the Laws of Christiani∣ty, are incumbent on each. And.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>As to the duties which Christianity obliges Souldiers to discharge, who are only by their Mi∣litary Exercises at home in preparation for War.</HI> And the duties of these may be ranckt under five general heads: As,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Christianity obliges Souldiers to engage in these preparative Military Exercises for a right end,</HI> such as God <HI>may approve of.</HI> It is the <HI>Prerogative</HI> of man, by which he is raised a∣bove the level of the inferiour Creation, to act upon deliberation, and free Election, <HI>as a cause by Counsel</HI> of his own actions: hence he must act for some End; which he is to have in his eye, and make the measure of his actions; which End ought to be some∣thing worthy and proportionable to those intellective and elective powers, with which humane nature is Ennobled. And this is one principal hinge on which the moral good, or evil of his actions does turn. For though the <HI>Intention</HI> of a good End be not of it self sufficient to legitimate, or consecrate an act∣ion, <HI>as some have vainly asserted;</HI> yet the want
<PB N="15" REF="001016_0016_0FAEEDBC9A7FD040"/>
of it will desecrate and prophane the best.</P>
<P>Such therefore, as would engage in any af∣fair, so as to observe therein the dictates of the Christian Religion, must look well to their end; that it be such, as may be approved of at the Tribunal of God, &amp; the bar of unpre∣judiced reason; to both of which man stands accountable. Here then, by the rules of Christianity, the Souldier in these his prepara∣tory Exercises stands obliged to have a good end in his intention. And this ought to be the same end with that, for which the <HI>Art Military</HI> was first contrived &amp; instituted. In this affair that maxim of the Schools is not to take place, <HI>Non Idem finis Artis et Artificis:</HI> the end of the Art and Artist is not here to be distinguisht: Now this end is as ultimately the honour of God, in the good and safety of the Common weal, so nextly to be prepared for real Service, when the publick safety calls for it. Military Exercise is not to be lookt on as a play fit for Children, but as a work &amp; business for men: Men are to engage in these Exercises not meerly for diversion, but with an actual design to get themselves ready to stand <HI>in the high places of the field, to speak with the Enemy in the gate,</HI> when Providence shall call them forth. This end, it is be feared, is far from the thought of the most, that put themselves under discipline: The most never
<PB N="16" REF="001016_0017_0FAEEDBD64AF5798"/>
dream of real Service; they think of an in∣nocent diversion, to make a goodly appear∣ance, to look big and strutt in Armour; and no wonder if such be crest fallen when an E∣nemy invades the Land, &amp; danger approaches. By the want of this end the Christian Souldi∣er violates his Christian obligation: without this design of real Service these Exercises, with what pomp so ever managed, are but a vain shew; which according to the rules of Reli∣gion will deface the Character of a Martial Spirit. The Souldier, that has not this prepa∣ration for real Service in his Eye, can give no tolerable account why he appears in Arms; unless to fill up an empty space with some∣thing as empty and void: such are no better than Cyphers placed at the left hand of an Accompt, which no whit advances the Sum; they add not to the number of the chosen men of Israel, <HI>men prepared for war.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Christianity requires a due caution against all those things that are subversive of this end.</HI> That which obliges us to intend and will the end, obliges us to nill and refuse every thing that tends to frustrate that end: If therefore the Souldier, while at home &amp; in peace, is bound in his Military Exercises to aim at a prepara∣tion for real Service; it then naturally fol∣lows, that he is under the same engagement to take heed, that he avoid all that will impede
<PB N="17" REF="001016_0018_0FAEEDBE5570D4A0"/>
this his preparation, or render him unfit for Service: left when Providence shall open the Campaign, and post him in the line of battel he be found faint hearted and dare not; or, undisciplined, and so knows not how to main∣tain his Post when vigorously assaulted. And there are many things, which the Souldier is obliged by Christianity to take heed against, as that which will subvert his end in these preparatory Exercises: we may hint at some of them.</P>
<P><HI>Tbus the Souldier is obliged to take heed against luxury and debauchery.</HI> For these will emascu∣late and effeminate his Spirits, and so unfit him to enter the list against an hardy foe. <HI>He that striveth for mastery,</HI> faith the Apostle, <HI>is temperate in all things, 1 Cor. 9. 25.</HI> Intempe∣rance enfeebles the body, and renders it unfit for heroick actions; it softens the mind, and so indisposes the man for any noble &amp; great resolves; but prepares him to be an easy prey to an insulting Enemy. This proved fatal to <HI>Benhadad</HI> &amp; his confederate Princes, <HI>I King.</HI> 20 16.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>Sloth and Idleness the Souldier at home is obliged to watch against.</HI> A Military life is a life of action; and whatever unfits for action unfits for that Service. Now sloth by a Physical efficiency abates the vigour, and damps the noble purposes of the Soul; it rusts
<PB N="18" REF="001016_0019_0FAEEDBED4245B58"/>
the Spirits, and causes the faculties of ope∣ration to contract an unaccountable hebitude and dulness. Idleness is a sort of Lethargy that benums the active powers of the Soul, &amp; lays them asleep. It renders the Souldier a∣verse to undertake and incapable to undergo the fatigues of a Martial Expedition. The slothful is never like to blazon his own glo∣ry, defend his Country, or advance its renown by his Exploits in the field of War. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> therefore is to be condemned as destructive of the true end of Souldiery, and as such, pro∣hibited by the rules of Christianity, <HI>What e∣ver thine hands find to do, do with all thy might: Be not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in business, &amp;c.</HI> These are docu∣ments of Christianity.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>The Souldier must avoid every thing that tends to nourish Security</HI> Security will keep him from due preparations; and expose to inevitable ruine, when danger approaches. This was that which laid <HI>Laish</HI> desolate <HI>Judg.</HI> 18. 27 She was <HI>quiet</HI> and <HI>secure,</HI> and so soon surprized into ruin; the inhabitants cut off by the <HI>Edge of the Sword,</HI> and the City <HI>burnt with fire</HI></P>
<P>Again, <HI>Christianity obliges them to take heed that they do not over rate, and value the present life.</HI> An over value for life will unfit a Souldi∣er for that Service, in which he must carry his life in his hand: it will indispose him to
<PB N="19" REF="001016_0020_0FAEEDBFF9A14008"/>
Sacrifice it in the field of honour, for the pre∣servation of the publick tranquillity. The estimate, which <HI>Pomp<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y</HI> made of life, was highly becoming the Character of a Christian Souldier, when with great violence <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by many from Embarquing in a violent storm, replyed with in heroick bravery, <HI>My Voyage is necessary, my Life is not so.</HI></P>
<P>Finally, <HI>Christians obliges that they take heed of an ungovernable Spirit.</HI> Such a Spirit in Souldiers threatens all with confusion: it is the spring from whence all mutinies, and in∣surrections proceed: when this spirit troubles the Camp, nothing but desolation is to be ex∣pected: it is the worst of plagues, that can invade an Army; it is infectious, &amp; threatens the whole; it spread, like a gangreen; and is ordinarily cured by no <HI>lennives,</HI> but only by the sharpest <HI>corrosives</HI> of Martial discipline. Christianity therefore requires Souldiers while at home in peace in these Exercises, to take heed against this ungovernable spirit, as that which is obstructive to the true end of Soulde∣ry: And the <HI>prevailing of this Spirit is judged by persons of thought &amp; observation to be not the least ill Omen that attends the Military affairs of this Land.</HI> Now against all these things, which are impedimental to the end of Military or∣der, our Religion enters a caution.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>It obliges to diligence in the pursuit of this
<PB N="20" REF="001016_0021_0FAEEDC4947F8730"/>
End by the most proper and accommodable means.</HI> He that is obliged to will the End, is obli∣ged to chuse, and diligently to pursue the means that lead to that End. Hence Soul∣diers being obliged in their present Exercises to make preparation for real Service, in or∣der to the publick repose; they stand obli∣ged by the same rule, to use the most proper means to get ready. To this end Christia∣nity requires, that the Souldier get furnisht with <HI>proper Armour,</HI> or <HI>Martial Weapons:</HI> Without these he can't be prepared for Ser∣vice; neither to defend himself, nor to of∣fend his Adversary. And it is no season to seek for Arms, when called into the Field. It is no wonder the uncircumcised <HI>Philistines</HI> did obtain an easy Triumph over <HI>Israel,</HI> when there was <HI>not a Shield or a Spear found among fourty thousand of Israel, Judg</HI> 5. 8. As the Spiritual Souldier is not prepared to main∣tain his post against the Militia of Hell, un∣less arrayed with the whole Armour of God; so the proper Souldier will not be pre∣pared to prevent, or repel the violence of his adversaries, unless provided with Arms. Religion and reason demand this provision <HI>And such trifle with duty, who neglect it.</HI></P>
<P>Again, it obliges Souldiers to a due care that they may attain <HI>Military Science.</HI> Wea∣pons are to no purpose without skill to use
<PB N="21" REF="001016_0022_0FAEEDC57A634400"/>
them. He that in these preparatory Exer∣cises does not attain expertness therein, when called to Engage, will find his Armour al∣most as uneasy and useless, as the Stripling <HI>David</HI> did <HI>Sauls;</HI> and for the same reason because he <HI>had not proved it.</HI> Skill in the Art Military is a necessary medium to that End which Christianity propounds to the Souldier. And the most polite Nations have most endeavoured after proficiency here∣in. It is the opinion of some verst in anti∣quity, that the Jews had their School for the Souldier, as well as the Prophet; by which they maintained their Glory. Sure we may be it was the wisdom of the Patriarch <HI>Abra∣ham</HI> to discipline his Houshold. <HI>Gen.</HI> 14. 14. It was <HI>Davids</HI> prudence, after <HI>Sauls</HI> defeat at <HI>Mount Githoa,</HI> to order the instruction of the <HI>men of Judah in the use of the bow, 2 Sam.</HI> 1. 18. Dexterity in this Art layes the foun∣dation for Martial Glory. Without this skill an Army for number most formidable may be put to the rout by a few well disciplin'd Troops. We shall find abundant witness of this, if we consult the records of Antiquity: This it was that Crown'd <HI>Alexander</HI> with victorious Lawrels, and loaded him with the Spoils of his undisciplined Enemies: This ad∣vanced <HI>Caesar</HI> to a Triumphal Chariot: By this <HI>Rome</HI> enlarged her Dominions, and her
<PB N="22" REF="001016_0023_0FAEEDC59D7BE9A0"/>
Inhabitants vanquished in Battel double the number of Enemies, who possibly might e∣qual, if not surpass them in natural strength and courage. The Glory of most King∣doms has ebb'd and flow'd with this skill. This therefore is a necessary medium to real Service: It is not therefore to be lookt on as a matter of indifference, but of Christian obligation, in the present state of the world.</P>
<P>Another medium which tends to fit the Souldier for Service <HI>is Good Orders.</HI> Religion therefore obliges to due care for the preser∣vation hereof. Order is the beauty of the Universe; the Strength and Glory of all Societies; without which they would dis∣band and crumble into nothing: Without Order a <HI>Bethel</HI> will become a <HI>Babel,</HI> an <HI>Army</HI> a confused <HI>Rout.</HI> Now this Order among Souldiers consists in every one's keeping to the duties of their respective places: When the Officers duly give out their Orders; and those under Command do not contest them; but with quick obedience move in the line of duty: It is fatal to a Military Body to have this Order broken: The preservation of it is one good step to make it unconque∣rable. Agreeably we have this description of an invincible Army. <HI>Joel 2 7. They march every one in his way; and none shall break their ranks.</HI> The wisdom of all Nations has judg∣ed
<PB N="23" REF="001016_0024_0FAEEDC656DB6120"/>
the greatest severity of Martial Discipline justifyable towards such, as break this Order. And the greatest Generals by the Execution of this Discipline, have in all Ages signalized their steady conduct. Memorable is the ac∣count we have of <HI>Papirius</HI> the Dictator, who was with great difficulty perswaded to spare the life of young <HI>Fabius,</HI> the Master of his Horse, for fighting, though successfully, in his absence, and against Order. Famous is the Story of <HI>Titus Manlius,</HI> who condemned his own brave Son to Death; for the like victo∣rious attempt; being repugnant to Order. No Order, without indisputable Obedience; this therefore, as one sayes, is the Key stone of the Arch, which binds and sustains the whole fabrick.</P>
<P>Now if Order be thus necessary to an Ar∣my when called abroad to fight, it follows that the maintainance of it at home is a ne∣cessary preparative to real Service. None can in these preparatory Exercises wink at a breach of this Order, but they betray that trust, which God and their Country have reposed in them. The mildest Commander must make conscience while at home, to pre∣serve this Order by a due Execution of Dis∣cipline on such as violate it: Otherwise they will train up Souldiers, who, when called forth to Service, will be prepared, not to obey,
<PB N="24" REF="001016_0025_0FAEEDC715C82FE8"/>
but mutiny; not to fight, but run, to the reproach of their Leaders, scorn of their E∣nemies, and ruin of the Publick.</P>
<P N="4">4 <HI>Christianity requires that they get their minds arrayed with those Christian vertues which will qualifie them for the attainment of this End.</HI> The former were external media, these internal. Let the Souldiers industry be never so great, his application never so close to the outward means, that tend to fit him for Service; yet there are Christian ver∣tues, without which he will remain unready when the Signal is given, to take the Alarm, and arm for Battel.</P>
<P>Thus the Souldier should labour after <HI>a Publick Spirit.</HI> That Souldier is unqualified for Service, that can't lay claim to this Orna∣ment of the Soul. A private Spirit, under the government of narrow and stingy prin∣ciples, is not a Martial Spirit; it is a blemish to the <HI>Man of War.</HI> This will quash all just hopes of Service from such: Such will prefer their own private interest before the com∣mon tranquillity: A man of a private Spirit, though very solicitous about the safety of his own Cabbine; yet is little thoughtful for the Welfare of the bottom, in which his all is Embarked. Such a one is not prepared to ven∣ture his Life in a generous &amp; hazardous En∣terprize for the common Weal. The Souldi∣er
<PB N="25" REF="001016_0026_0FAEEDC80A343A78"/>
therefore must labour after a publick Spi∣rit; a Spirit to resent all the calamities, and to be passionately concerned for the prospe∣rity of his Country. With this Spirit we find those Worthies indued, <HI>Gid on, Baruch, Sampson, Jephthab,</HI> and <HI>David;</HI> and with this <HI>Armour</HI> they came prepared to fight the Lords Battels.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>Magnanimity, or Greatness of Spirit,</HI> is another vertue, which qualifies for Service; &amp; this Christianity commands; and the Souldi∣er in his present preparations is to seek after. By Magnanimity the Souldier will be quali∣fied to engage in any noble and generous at∣tempt; and will chuse rather to sacrifice his own life, than the publick peace, or his own honour. The truly great spirited Souldier is prepared to bear up against all the hard∣ships of the warmest Service, with an unbro∣ken and erect mind; when the Cause of God and his People shall press him into their Service. This Spirit rested upon good <HI>Nehemi∣ah,</HI> when he cried out, as <HI>Neh.</HI> 6. 11. <HI>Shall such a man as I fly?</HI> This Spirit inspired that noble General, who when deserted by his Army in heat of battel, thus did reprimand them: <HI>Go, says he, tell the Living that I dy FIGHTING; while I go and report to the Dead, that you live FLYING.</HI></P>
<P>Finally, <HI>True Piety </HI> is a necessary qualifica∣tion
<PB N="26" REF="001016_0027_0FAEEDC88F3D2750"/>
for a Souldier in his preparation for Ser∣vice. The pious man, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> will be found most ready to engage in the most bloody Encounters for the publick defence. Piety will secure the Souldier the proper protection of Divine Providence; which as an impenetrable helmet will defend him; it inflames the mind with the strongest reso∣lution. Hence we find it the character of the Righteous. <HI>Prov 28. 1. The righteous are as bold as a lyon.</HI> It was by Faith that those Wor∣thies waxed <HI>valiant in battel, subdued King∣doms, and put to flight armies of Aliens,</HI> in <HI>Heb. 11. 34.</HI> A guilty and defiled Conscience is a bad preparation for Service. Such while under a stupefaction through inconsideration may be fool hardy, but not truly brave and valiant: But once they come to have their eyes opened, and take a view of themselves with respect to the <HI>future state;</HI> they will dread their Enemies Artillery as if charged with <HI>hell and damnation:</HI> God, as well as man will appear marching in the Camp to confront them; and no wonder then if their hearts saint, and they turn the back in the day of battel. These vertues are preparative qualifications. If therefore the Souldier would get ready for Service, he must endea∣vour to get his mind arrayed with these, Chri∣stianity obliges hereto: And the Camp is
<PB N="27" REF="001016_0028_0FAEEDCC64971890"/>
not the most proper School to learn them in.</P>
<P N="5">5. It requires <HI>a dependance on God for his Blessing to make all means successful to the design∣ed end.</HI> The Christian in all his wayes ows a deference to God as the fountain and au∣thor of all blessings. It was the Wise mans advice, <HI>Prov. 3. 6. In all thy ways acknowledge him;</HI> and this the Souldier is bound to in these his Military Exercises; and this is done by a dependance on him for a blessing, that so he may not in vain attend this business, but may be prepared to fight the battel of the Lord against the mighty. It is Gods <HI>prerogative</HI> thus to prepare the Souldier. Mi∣litary skill, courage, and all other martial ac∣complishments, are his gift; hence <HI>David,</HI> that man of War, does ascribe to God the Glory, <HI>Psal. 144. 1. He teaches my hands to war, and my fingers to fight.</HI> Without this Divine blessing, all means will fall short, &amp; leave the Souldier unready. <HI>They may make bright their Armour, and gather the Shields toge∣ther, yet if God raise not up the Spirits of men,</HI> all will be to no purpose: The Souldiery will be only fit to adorn and advance their Enemies triumphs. Thus we have consider∣ed the duties of Souldiers at home, or in a time of peace, engaged in these preparatory Military Exercises; which duties not barely <HI>moral prudence,</HI> or <HI>state policy,</HI> but <HI>Christianity</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="001016_0029_0FAEEDCD4F09F9C0"/>
obliges to the discharge of. This is the <HI>work of the Lord:</HI> and there is a Curse En∣tailed on those, that do this work deceitful∣ly, <HI>Jer.</HI> 48▪ 10. It remains that we pass to the second thing, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>We are to consider the duties incumbent on Military men, when called to real Service;</HI> and these duties may be disposed under these heads.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Christianity obliges them to see that their cause be just.</HI> No War is just but what is levied upon just reasons: <HI>The Sword of the Lord, as well as of Gideon,</HI> must be the signal to battel. What those things are, which are requisite to legitimate a War, is not my province to deter∣mine. To be sure it is just, when the necessa∣ry defence of Religion, the prevention of the ruin of the Civil State, do call for it. I shall not essay critically to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, men in private capacities are to enquire into the rea∣son of making War: It would require more time to a just determination hereof, than is allowed me; not it is a case to be determined with great caution and tenderness; since all the reasons of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which will render a war lawful &amp; necessary, do not ly level ordinarily to the capacities of private persons. How∣ever no private person can with a good Con∣science engage in a War evidently unjust, and oppressive; To engage in it under such cir∣cumstances, is to engage in Rapine &amp; Murder;
<PB N="29" REF="001016_0030_0FAEEDCDEDCE6CD8"/>
and such combatants, if they fall in the battel, are in danger of the <HI>tragical Exit</HI> of those spo∣ken of, <HI>Ezek. 32. 27. Who are said to descend to bell with their weapons of war.</HI> The light of nature, as well as Christianity, does require that there be a just cause of engaging in hostile attempts. The <HI>Romans</HI> of old seem∣ed to have a just sense hereof; hence they instituted <HI>a Colledge of Priests,</HI> who were term'd <HI>Feciales,</HI> or <HI>Heralds at Arms;</HI> whose business it was to inquire into the reasons of War, and only on sufficient reasons to proclaim it: and until this was done, their Armies were to ab∣stain from all acts of hostility. The justness of the cause of War is required in the <HI>jus feci∣ale,</HI> or law of Arms, which is one branch of the law of Nations; and this the Souldier according to the regulation of Christianity must have regard to.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It requires that they have a sufficient Call to ingage herein.</HI> Without this the justness of the cause will not avail; Some <HI>Casuists</HI> with no small vigour dispute, whether a Military employment do properly belong to a Christi∣ans <HI>general</HI> or <HI>particular Calling;</HI> whether it be <HI>institutum vitae,</HI> or <HI>munus,</HI> a profession of life or an office strictly speaking; but it seems a needless combate. All must own that it can't be undertaken, as many other civil pro∣fessions may, <HI>jure proprio,</HI> by a mans own
<PB N="30" REF="001016_0031_0FAEEDCE9A390B10"/>
original authority; but <HI>jure delegato,</HI> by autho∣rity derived from others who have sufficient authority, the power of life and death in their hands. Now since it is so, none are to ingage in real Service but such, as have a sufficient call thereto. The Capital offender deserves death; yet none but such, as hold the Sword of Justice, can warrant his Execution. The reason is the same in the case before us, to kill in War ought to be only an Execution of Justice, which men must be authorized to: Indeed it is lawful may highly laudable and noble for men voluntarily to offer themselves to the publick Service; but yet they must carry to receive their orders from such, as have authority to grant them: without this they will have no call to engage; unless forced to it in their own necessary defence.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>It requires that in their Engagements they should quit themselves like men; and that on the principles of Christianity.</HI> It requires that they engage with that vigour, resolution, &amp; cou∣rage, which becomes the Cause of God they are engaged in, and the hopes of a glorious immortality, which Christianity sets before them. When Gods people of old were called forth to Battel; the Priests were com∣manded thus to address them. <HI>Deut. 20. 3. Let not your hearts faint fear not &amp; do not trem∣ble, neither be ye terrified because of them.</HI> The
<PB N="31" REF="001016_0032_0FAEEDCF5616BD48"/>
want of this courageous and manly deport∣ment, Souldiers will betray the Cause of God and their Countrey, in which they are engaged; and bring a lasting reproach and infamy on their own names: The want of this resolution will procure the Souldier <HI>Captive Chains</HI> instead of <HI>Victorious Lawrels:</HI> Instead of <HI>Riding,</HI> it will cause him to be <HI>Led in Triumph,</HI> dragg'd at the Conquerors Chariot Wheels. The Souldier therefore in Battel must signalize an undaunted Spirit, as a defendant in bearing up against the force of the assailant; as an aggressor in giving the Enemy sufficient proof of his skill and strength. In all the Souldier must quit him∣self like a man; and this must be done on Christian principles; having an eye to the recompence of reward; to the Crown not of fading lawrels, but of immorcessible Glo∣ry, which before he had secured, through the merits of Christ a flawless title to: and with this prospect, which only Christianity can give, he may mock at fear, defy danger, and not give ground, when the quiver, the glittering spear, and the shield rattles against him: knowing that whether he stand or fall, he shall be Crown'd as Victor in the other World.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>It requires that they watch against those
<PB N="32" REF="001016_0033_0FAEEDD027A43D38"/>
Temptations that are more peculiar to their Post.</HI> Every Station, that Divine Providence places any of the Children of men in, is be∣set with its peculiar temptations. Hells po∣licy, the Worlds flattery, the Hearts treache∣ry, cause it to be thus. And the Station of a Souldier in the Camp is no ways exempt∣ed: while he breathes continually on the borders of the Territories of the King of Terrors; he walks amidst more dangerous snares, laid by the Destroyer, to take away the life of his Soul. He is beleagured by more Temptations, sworn Enemies to his Spiritual tranquillity; than with Enemies to his outward peace: There are sins, which are peculiarly ready to <HI>trouble the Camp;</HI> and infect the Souldiery. Of this nature are those Evils which the Baptist in our Context warns the Souldiers against, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>Do violence to no man; accuse no man faisly; and be content with your Wages.</HI> Now with respect to these Temptations, the life of a Souldier ought to be a life of circumspecti∣on. He should be always upon his guard, left he be surprized taken, bound, led in triumph, and made the sport and pastime of these <HI>Philistine Lusts,</HI> that war against the Soul. These not guarded against, will pre∣serve some accursed thing, which will trou∣ble the Camp of <HI>Israel.</HI></P>
<P N="5"><PB N="33" REF="001016_0034_0FAEEDD3B592A920"/>
5. Lastly, <HI>It requires that they do all, that in them lies to Engage Gods presence in their Camp.</HI> The best disciplined Army under the conduct of <HI>David'</HI>s Worthies, without this presence of God, will never render a people successful in War: <HI>The Race is not to the swift; nor the Battel to the strong. Eccles.</HI> 9. 11. God is the Lord of Hosts; the God of Battel. His presence will put life and vigour into the most feeble host, and cause them to do valiantly: With this presence the <HI>Thistle</HI> may challenge, and look in the face the <HI>Cedar of Lebanon.</HI> When God marcheth in the Camp, an handful of men shall vanquish puissant Armies; one shall chase a thousand, and ten put ten thousand to flight. Whatever side God takes shall prove victorious. This presence of God therefore the Souldier is obliged to Engage with him; as that which is necessary to his success. From a full perswasion of this it was, that when-ever the people of <HI>Israel</HI> went out to Battel, the <HI>Ark,</HI> that <HI>Symbol of Gods Presence,</HI> and the <HI>promised Messias,</HI> was carried into the Camp: On the presence of which they more depended than on their own strength, skill or number. And when ever an Army can Engage their Enemy with that triumphant Song in their mouths,
<PB N="34" REF="001016_0035_0FAEEDD503DB1750"/>
<HI>Psal. 46 7. The Lord of Hosts is with us; and the God of Jacob our refuge.</HI> They need not fear the number, power, or policy of their adversaries. Such are immured in God, as in an impregnable fortress; a fortress that can never be taken by Storm or Battery; or betray'd by treachery or stratagem. This Divine <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> or <HI>Presence,</HI> it becomes the Souldier to secure; that so it may ap∣pear that the Battel is the Lords.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="application">
<HEAD>USE I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>This teaches us. That the good Christian is like to make the best Souldier.</HI> Indeed others may be masters of as great or greater natu∣ral strength, courage, and policy; but yet the good Christian, when all other things are equal, is like to prove the best Martialist. For he is the best Souldier that best per∣forms the duties that Christianity prescribes the Souldier; and consequently he is most like to prove the best Souldier, who is most like to observe these duties; &amp; the Religious man will in all probability make most Con∣science to observe these directions: Hence the Devout Souldier is like to make the greatest proficiency in Military Accomplishments, and so to be best prepared for Service: He is likely to atchieve the greatest Exploits when called to look danger in the face.

<P><HI>This teaches us who are fittest to be put upon real Service:</HI> <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Such as are best prepared to perform the duties incumbent on the true Souldier: Such as have the greatest ability, obligation and fidelity to discharge the du∣ties of their post. The halt, the lame, and the blind are as unfit to serve God in the Field, as at the Altar. Men, of no love to the publick, of no interest in the State, of no honour nor conscience, of little Martial Skill, and of less Courage, are not fit to make up a detachment to Engage an Ene∣my, and fight the Lords Battels: When such are cull'd out, and dispatcht into the field, or posted in Garrisons, Forts, as good enough to serve in such important posts; the Common Weal is in effect betrayed, the most probable method pursued to secure the Enemies Triumph, and a peoples own defeat, and ruine. Those that devote such as these unqualified ones to publick Service,

do but too much imitate the prophane Priests of old, in their defective oblations; as if they were destined to the same design, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> to Sacrifice. Yet this is an error that most places are apt to fall into.</P>

<P>The disciplined Souldier, that makes a figure at home, must not shrink back when Providence calls him to March abroad to confront a Publick Enemy: It is not suffici∣ent for a Trained Souldier to Excel in these Military Exercises at home; but when call'd must enter the list: he must not take up with <HI>Jehoash's</HI> taunting advice to <HI>Amaziah, 2 King. 14. 10.
