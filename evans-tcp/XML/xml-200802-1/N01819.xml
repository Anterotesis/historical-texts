<HEAD>New NEWS from <HI>Robinson Cruso</HI>'s ISLAND, IN A Letter to a Gentleman at <HI>Portsmouth.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAving some time since resolv'd to do my self the Honour of writing to You, I at length thro' great difficulty, retired an hour from Noise and Clamour, the smoak of <HI>Coffee-houses,</HI> and the <HI>suffocating Stench</HI> of <HI>Court-flattery,</HI> (a wonderful Engine in this Pedantick age,) whereby Men of small fortune and smaller merit, easily climb to a considerable pitch of Honour and Greatness; and <HI>Preferments</HI> are confer'd on none but such as will <HI>comply</HI> and <HI>conform</HI> to <HI>another's</HI> Passion. And without passing the fulsom Compliments of <HI>Incomparable,</HI> and <HI>Extensive Blessing,</HI> I shall hint to you some Transactions of Moment, in this part of the Globe, since the last printed News from our Island, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> commencing Jail-bird.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="002153_0002_0FBC784880262988"/>The DISTRESSED STATE of our Island, is I confess a Theme as <HI>melancholly</HI> as 'tis <HI>common.</HI> And if we take but a general Survey of our present Diffi∣culties in their various unhappy Circumstances, we shall find too much reason to conclude them the <HI>begin∣ning of Sorrows,</HI> and the dreadful prologue of more Complicated Miseries.</P>
<P>The Extream <HI>want</HI> of <HI>that,</HI> the love whereof is the root of all Evil, is the universal Complaint among us: So that there is hot talk that our Salary-Men, who (particularly the Ecclesiasticks) have hitherto had an Honourable Support and suitable to their Character, must <HI>lower their Top-sails,</HI> and be Content to take their pay in the <HI>produce of the Island.</HI> The blood and vital Spirits of the Body-politick, (I mean the Medium of Exchange) is so near exhausted as portends a <HI>Certain,</HI> &amp; <HI>Speedy</HI> dissolution.</P>
<P>The greatest part of the paper Credit, which is yet out-standing, is fallen into the hands of a few <HI>wretched Misers,</HI> (whose <HI>desires are Enlarged as Hell,</HI>) who li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s fat beasts, stand gaping to devour their Indigent but honest Neighbours, and with hearts more unrelenting by far than his, make their Necessi∣tous Circumstances their cursed opportunity to <HI>Enrich themselves</HI>: and having wrested their Estates from them for half the Value, they boast (like those Sin∣ners <HI>Solomon</HI> Cautions to beware of,) <HI>that they have found precious Substance, and filled their houses with spoil.</HI></P>
<P>In what prodigious Shoals do Men flock to Use∣rers to <HI>hire</HI>! and perhaps when they have waited at their Gates as long as King <HI>John</HI> did at the Pope's Legat's, they may obtain admittance; and those who possess Estates in Lands worth 500l. may pawn them for 94 <HI>for the Interest must be paid before they receive the Principal</HI>; and besides that, there must be a <HI>gratuity</HI> proportionable to the urgency of their wants, before they can come off so well.</P>
<P>Among the innumerable exorbitant Mischiefs which
<PB N="3" REF="002153_0003_0FBC784A21EFD208"/>
arise from the want of of some proper Medium of Ex∣change, these are not the least: The <HI>Trade,</HI> by which our Island chiefly subsists, is <HI>wofully embarass'd</HI>; and many a noble Project (and profitable to the Publick) <HI>sadly retarded</HI>; a Multiplicity of <HI>Law-Suits,</HI> to the enriching a few <HI>luxuriant Cut-throats,</HI> and reducing many honest, frugal, industrious Familys to <HI>Beggary,</HI> and <HI>many more</HI> to the very precipice of Ruin, unless speedy Relief intervene. Are not <HI>Oppression, Injustice</HI> aud <HI>Cruelty</HI> (like an Innundation) making a <HI>rapid Pro∣gress</HI> among us? And have we not great reason to fear a more <HI>tragic Scene</HI> will open before we are aware? But on whom must we Father all this <HI>Ca∣talogue of Mischiefs</HI> (to which a multitude more might be added) when the black <HI>Master-roll</HI> comes to be made up? Is it not an Argument, that <HI>those</HI> who <HI>reject,</HI> and <HI>hiss</HI> at <HI>all</HI> proposals (even the most fair and promising) which are made by <HI>others,</HI> and <HI>propose nothing at all</HI> themselves, would have nothing at all <HI>DONE</HI> that might conduce to our Relief &amp; advantage?</P>
<P>Our Expectations of Redress the <HI>last Session</HI> (the <HI>Expence</HI> and <HI>Damage</HI> whereof has not been much less than that of <HI>broken Conventions,</HI> with which we were threatned, if the former were not managed according to <HI>some men's minds</HI>) have been greatly raised, and the Representative Body of the Island carried on things with great Prudence, as far as possible; and I need not tell you where their Conclusions met with a resolute Repulse.</P>
<P>The Opposition which the Emission of more Paper Credit has met with, has afforded various matter of Speculation among us; and many have been the Con∣jectures about it, it being something unnaccountable what Men should be driving at, who (like <HI>Water-men</HI>) <HI>look one way,</HI> while at the same time they <HI>now the contrary</HI>; insomuch that many (who are willing to think the best) are apt to fix them with the Carcass of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> between Heaven and Earth; or with <HI>Bellarmine,</HI> the Atlas of the Papal Cause, to whom
<PB N="4" REF="002153_0004_0FBC784E0ECF1788"/>
the Catholicks (because he wrote so much like a Heretick) assign a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Perhaps 'tis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> place, between Heaven and Hell.</P>
<P>The Great D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n of the County of <HI>E—x,</HI> (who shakes his Rod terribly over the whole County, and makes his Minions cringe at his Feet) was seiz'd with <HI>Belshazzar's</HI> fit of trembling (tho' doubtless from an <HI>Infernal Impression</HI>) lest the <HI>Bill</HI> should pass the B—d, and his <HI>Deify'd Mammon</HI> cease to bring in such a gri∣ping Usury as is <HI>calculated to the Meridian of his Con∣science.</HI></P>
<P>There were also <HI>terrible Alarms</HI> among the whole <HI>C—s Clan</HI> in this great Crisis, for fear the result should not please their <HI>Masters</HI>; but since good Pro∣jections have been crush'd in the Birth, they begin to <HI>hecter</HI> and <HI>bullie</HI> with abundance of Confidence, as if they had gained the Point to <HI>all Intents and Purposes</HI>; tho' several of them <HI>want Cash</HI> as much as their Neighbours.</P>
<P>However, some of the most Judicious and Intelli∣gent among us, have ventured to <HI>Query,</HI> whether the following things be not the <HI>Spring</HI> and <HI>Source</HI> of the forementioned Opposition.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Covetousness</HI>: Which consists in an <HI>eager</HI> and <HI>insatiable</HI> Thirst after Riches, which hurries Men on in the Acquisition of Worldly Goods, tho' in the most <HI>unjust, injurious</HI> and <HI>clandestine</HI> ways. 'Tis a <HI>Gan∣grene</HI> in the Soul, that with a <HI>pay so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Heat,</HI> consumes the Natural Affections, to supply their room with the most <HI>virulent Humours.</HI> This <HI>furious Desire</HI> precipi∣tates Men on to Oppression, Violence and Deceit; so that they will not <HI>stick to betray and sell their Country,</HI> if thereby they can enrich themselves, and promote their private Interests; for when this caused Lust has once gain'd the Ascendant in the Soul, is it any won∣der if men prostitute the Gifts of <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Provi∣dence,</HI> to the most <HI>base</HI> and <HI>servile</HI> Ends? Nature, in the production of Gold (as one ingeniously observes) seems to have presaged the <HI>Misery of her Lovers,</HI> by making the place where it grows barren of Herbs,
<PB N="5" REF="002153_0005_0FBC785000693D68"/>
Plants, &amp;c. intimating thereby that in the Minds where the <HI>Desire</HI> of this Metal shall <HI>take Birth,</HI> no Sparks of <HI>Honour</HI> or <HI>Vertue</HI> shall remain.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Envy</HI>: Which is a <HI>Diabolical Passion,</HI> that renders those in whom it is predominant <HI>Emphatically the Chil∣dren of the Devil.</HI> It stirs up in Men a <HI>pining</HI> at the good of others, and <HI>gnaws</HI> their <HI>Hearts</HI> with continual Torment. How do some <HI>vex</HI> and <HI>frett</HI> themselves, at the prosperity and good of <HI>Others</HI>? And how would they (if they could) <HI>Ahab</HI>-like, hook in their fair Estates? that they may <HI>join House to House, &amp; lay Field to Field,</HI> &amp;c. tho' there is a terrible W O denounc'd against them, <HI>Isai.</HI> 5. 8.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Pride.</HI> Pride and Envy are Sisters of the same Complexion and Shape, and equally pernicious in their <HI>Effects.</HI> Ambition is a <HI>ravishing Passion,</HI> that easily glides into the Soul, but makes an unwilling Retreat. 'Tis a furious Desire, that knows no bounds, but <HI>abso∣lute Lordship</HI> and <HI>Empire</HI> for <HI>it's self,</HI> and <HI>Beggary</HI> and <HI>Slavery</HI> for <HI>all others</HI>; which <HI>Age</HI> doth not <HI>mature,</HI> nor <HI>lesser Dignities satisfy.</HI> 'Tis a <HI>Gulf</HI> without <HI>Bottom</HI> or <HI>Shore</HI>; the <HI>Vacuum in Nature,</HI> which Philosophers have not found out, nor ever will.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Hypocrisy.</HI> And of <HI>all</HI> the foregoing evils, this is not to be esteem'd the least. For <HI>hereby</HI> (as a most Reverend Divine observes) <HI>Religion</HI> is made a <HI>Stalking-Horse</HI> whereby <HI>some Men</HI> serve the most vile and un∣worthy Ends; cloaking their Designs of <HI>Covetousness, Ambition,</HI> or <HI>Revenge,</HI> with pretence of <HI>Conscience</HI> and <HI>Zeal</HI>; and under the specious Umbrage hereof, the most <HI>execrable Villanies</HI> have been acted. This lurking Evil has slain it's <HI>Ten Thousands,</HI> and done more mischief in he World than open Impiety and Infidelity.</P>
<P>These are suppos'd to be the four <HI>main Springs,</HI> from whence the Opposition to more Bills, (tho' emitted on never so good a Foundation) proceeds. And is it any wonder, that a few <HI>Muck-worms,</HI> who have <HI>monopoliz'd</HI> vast Hoards of Bills should <HI>oppose</HI> it; seeing they have so fair a prospect (as they think) of raising their Estates,
<PB N="6" REF="002153_0006_0FBC785196503C08"/>
and building up their <HI>Names</HI> on the <HI>Ruins</HI> of their Country? Tho' hereby their Memory will be a <HI>Stench</HI> in the Nostrils of Posterity. For what else can we suppose them so furiously driving at (unless we are bound to believe their <HI>Words,</HI> against the <HI>Course</HI> and <HI>Tenor</HI> of their <HI>Actions</HI>) but to <HI>engross</HI> all the <HI>Estates in the Island</HI>; and themselves being <HI>Lords,</HI> the rest by Consequence their <HI>Slaves</HI>?</P>
<P>But will our Islanders, who have ever injoyed the Sweets of <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Freedom,</HI> be easily drove to <HI>Sla∣very</HI> by some <HI>whose Fathers many of them would have disdained to sit with the Dogs of their Flock</HI>? Certain∣ly no. And it is <HI>greatly to be hop'd,</HI> that on the 31<HI>st</HI> of <HI>May</HI> next, when the Convention comes together, they will be inspir'd with a Spirit of <HI>true discerning</HI> to distinguish between them who are <HI>Lovers</HI> of their Country and them who <HI>are not.</HI> Wisdom 2. 12. <HI>They are not for our turn, but are quite Contrary to us.</HI></P>
<P>There has been a great Bustle and Whispering of late about our <HI>Constitution</HI>; &amp; rais'd Expectations among <HI>many,</HI> (whose Endeavours have not been wanting) that <HI>those glorious Days for Lawyers and Gentlemen,</HI> which were prophesied of and wish'd for, <HI>January</HI> 12. 1703, 4, were making a near approach to us. But as hitherto the united attempts of Earth and Hell which have been formed against it have proved <HI>unsuccessful</HI>; so we hope that He who rules in the Kingdom of Providence, will <HI>deride</HI> their secret Counsels, <HI>defeat</HI> their Designs (tho' laid as deep as Hell) and <HI>cloath them</HI> with Shame and Confusion.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> It is no <HI>News</HI> to you (I presume) that the great DON-DAGO, the <HI>Primate-wou'd-be</HI> of our Island, (like the famous Dr. <HI>S—l</HI> has long ago <HI>burst his Orb, and become Eccentrick.</HI> And as for the Old <HI>Itch of Scribling,</HI> (tho' plung'd in the profound <HI>Atlantic</HI>) it is not yet extinguish'd.</P>
<P>Some time since we saw the Meteor call'd <HI>Aurora-Borealis</HI>; which is a forerunner of <HI>News</HI> from the <HI>North,</HI> and not long after we heard of a <HI>venomous Epistle,</HI> that
<PB N="7" REF="002153_0007_0FBC78546BA5EF58"/>
has been sent to <HI>your Parts,</HI> (with which the World may be favoured, if it can find a place among <HI>Tom Brown's</HI> Letters, the next Impression) wherein the Wri∣ter (as he has formerly convinc'd the World of his <HI>ex∣quisite Knack at daubing with untempered Mortar</HI>) has given us to understand, that he is Master of the Art of <HI>enviously detracting</HI> from the worth of good Men, (<HI>Gentlemen of known Integrity</HI>) by throwing dirt, to sully their Reputation, and blacken their Character. Moreover, he has represented a <HI>loyal</HI> and <HI>peaceable</HI> Peo∣ple, as <HI>Factious, Turbulent, and worse than the Savage Monsters of Africa.</HI></P>
<P>Some of our Ecclesiasticks of late, (for want of <HI>Discretion,</HI> without which <HI>Learning</HI> is <HI>Pedantry,</HI> and <HI>Wit, Impertinence,</HI>) have been guilty of <HI>too officious</HI> a meddling with <HI>State Affairs.</HI> The great substantial Duties of <HI>Faith, Repentance,</HI> and a <HI>good Life,</HI> are what they <HI>may</HI> and <HI>ought,</HI> with utmost Warmth and Energy to <HI>Inculcate</HI>; but whatever is not compris'd in these, is <HI>beside the Text, foreign to their Province, and another Gospel.</HI></P>
<P>To see a Clergy-man (<HI>Commedian</HI>-like) stand <HI>bela∣bouring his Cushion</HI> and intermixing his Harrangue with THUNDER-BOLTS, while he is entertaining his <HI>peaceable Congregation</HI> with things whereof he is almost as <HI>Ignorant,</HI> as I am of the <HI>Saddle</HI> Balaam <HI>rode on</HI> when his Ass spoke, and exhorting them to <HI>beware of a mutinons, mobbish Spirit, of siding with this or that Party and Interest</HI>; How <HI>ridiculous</HI> is the Sight and the Sound? How <HI>nauceous,</HI> and like a <HI>Parable in the Mouth of Fools</HI>? An empty noise, like <HI>sounding Brass,</HI> or a <HI>tinkling Cymbal.</HI></P>
<P>How do such Degrade their <HI>Sacred Function,</HI> and expose themselves to <HI>Contempt</HI> and <HI>Mimickry,</HI> and to be <HI>Burlisqu'd</HI> by every Pamphleteer? And how high∣ly meritorous is this of a <HI>Staff</HI> and Pair of <HI>Shoes.</HI></P>
<P>But, is not the Crime exceedingly aggravated, when any of that <HI>Order</HI> side with <HI>Parties,</HI> and foment <HI>Diffe∣rences</HI> THEMSELVES? When in their <HI>private Visits</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="002153_0008_0FBC7856CD103D00"/>
and at <HI>Gentlemens Tables,</HI> they take the Licence to <HI>revile, backbite</HI> and <HI>slander,</HI> endeavouring to <HI>widen</HI> the Differences between Men of <HI>high Station</HI> and <HI>Character,</HI> whose Influence is likely to affect the whole Island? Does not this render them <HI>vile,</HI> and minister just Occasion to ungodly Men to <HI>despise their Offerings</HI>? Does not this tend to <HI>harden</HI> Men in <HI>Atheism, Impiety</HI> and <HI>Infidelity,</HI> and to deem all <HI>Religion</HI> as a piece of <HI>Priest-Craft</HI> and <HI>State-Policy,</HI> to keep the World in Awe? And is it not the most certain and expediti∣ous way to effect their <HI>own Ruin</HI>?</P>
<P>But I must not be further tedious to you, because I hope in a short time to send you a more particular Account of things: In the mean time, recommending you and yours to the Care of the Divine Providence,</P>
