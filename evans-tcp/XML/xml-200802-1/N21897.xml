<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>AT a time when the thirst for knowledge is so universal, that it is sought after by all ranks of people; through its most intricate windings, and mazy labyrinths, it is not to be wondered at, that books of science and polite literature are published in such abund∣ance, and that they meet with that reception and en∣couragement, from a liberal minded public, which their noble design requires, and which their intrinsic merit demands.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The design of this publication, is not merely to amuse; but rather, in an engaging, diversified and pleasing manner, to attract the attention—imperceptibly gain the affections—and draw the soul to a love of virtue, (by delineating her in her most attractive and alluring dress) from whence arises the spring of all great, noble and generous actions:—To inculcate a sincere detesta∣tion of every species of vice, by an exposition of the malevolent affections of the mind, as well in their softer, as in their more glaring, or aggravated colours.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="028841_0004_0FDD1DDC98AC8F10"/>
<HI>The above, though not the least, is not the chief inten∣tion of this selection.—The art of thinking justly, speak∣ing pertinently and writing with correctness, ease, ele∣gance and precision upon any subject, has ever been esteemed the first ornament of the human mind, and justly accounted the grand characteristical mark, by which the rational being is distinguished from the irra∣tional.—Yet, how few do we find thus accomplished, or how very few give themselves any trouble to hold their rank in the great scale of animal creation? To render the above invaluable accomplishment easy of acquirement, is the principal design of</HI> THE HIVE, <HI>wherein all the vices, virtues, relative duties and affections of the hu∣man soul are delineated by the masterly hands of many of the first writers in the English language, who are as much esteemed for their correctness, ease, elegance and beauty of diction, as for their conciseness, perspicuity, justness and dignity of thought.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The editor of this miscellaneous volume, deeply im∣pressed with the importance of the above consideration, without any parade of unmeaning ceremony, humbly recommends</HI> THE HIVE <HI>to the support and attention of the candid public, as a publication solely intended to improve the heart, to inform the judgment, and gently to draw the affections to the love of virtue.</HI></P>

<HEAD>AFFLICTIONS.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>THE PRESENT MISFORTUNE IS ALWAYS DEEMED THE GREATEST: THEREFORE, SMALL CAUSES ARE SUFFICIENT TO MAKE US UNEASY, WHEN GREAT ONES ARE NOT IN THE WAY.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WE ought to make a good improve∣ment of past and present afflictions. If they are not sanctified to us, they become a double cross; but if they work rightly in us, and, convince us of our failings, and how justly we are afflicted, they do us much good. Affliction is a spiritual
<PB N="6" REF="028841_0006_0FDD1DDFB0726B88"/>
physic for the soul, and is compared to a furnace; for as gold is tried and purified therein, so men are proved, and either purified from their dross, and fitted for good uses, or else entirely burnt up and undone forever. Therefore may all who la∣bour under any kind of affliction, have reason to say with JOB—"when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as pure gold."</P>
<P>LET a man live (says Mr. Steele) but two or three years without affliction, and he is almost good for nothing, he cannot pray, nor meditate, nor keep his heart fixed upon spiritual things; but let God smite him in his child, health, or estate; now he can find his tongue and affections again, now he awakes and falls to his duty in earnest; now God has twice as much honour for him as he had before. Now, faith God, this amendment pleaseth me, this rod was well bestowed, I have disappointed him in his great benefit and advan∣tage.</P>
<P>IT may be boldly affirmed, that good men gen∣erally reap more substantial benefit from their af∣flictions, than bad men do from their prosperities; and what they lose in wealth, pleasure, or honor, they gain with vast advantage in wisdom, good∣ness and tranquillity of mind.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="028841_0007_0FDD1DE1133F46D0"/>
PROSPERITY is not without its troubles, nor adversity without its comforts. A mind that can bear affliction without murmur, and the weight of a plentiful fortune without vain glory—that can be familiar without meanness, and reserved with∣out pride, has something in it great, particularly pleasing, and truly admirable.</P>
<P>NOTHING would be more unhappy, (said De∣metrius) than a man who had never known afflic∣tion. The best need afflictions for the trial of their virtue: How can we exercise the grace of contentment, if all things succeed well? or, that of forgiveness if we have no enemies?</P>
<P>HE who barely weeps at misfortunes, when it is in his power to heal them, is not touched with them to the heart, and only sheds the tears of a crocodile.</P>
<P>IF you are disquieted at any thing, you should consider with yourself, Is this thing of that worth, that for it I should so disturb myself, and lose my peace and tranquillity?</P>
<P>THE consideration of a greater evil, is a sort of remedy against a lesser. THEY are always im∣paired by affliction, who are not improved by it. A virtuous man is more peaceable in adversity, than a wicked man in prosperity.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="028841_0008_0FDD1E15A5E9DB38"/>
THE keeping of ourselves above grief, and every painful passion, is indeed very beautiful and ex∣cellent; and none but souls of the first rate seem to be qualified for the undertaking.</P>
<P>IT were no virtue to bear calamities, if we did not feel them.</P>
<P>DIVINE PROVIDENCE always places the reme∣dy near the evil; there is not any duty to which Providence has not annexed a blessing; nor any affliction for which virtue has not provided a remedy.</P>
<P>IF some are refined like gold in the furnace of affliction, there are many more, that, like chaff, are consumed in it.</P>
<P>SORROW, when it is excessive, takes away fer∣vour from piety, vigour from action, health from the body, light from the reason, and repose from the conscience. Resignation to the divine will is a noble and needful lesson.</P>
<P>YET there is a gloomy pleasure in being deject∣ed and inconsolable. Melancholy studies how to improve itself, and sorrow finds wonderful relief in being more sorrowful.</P>
<P>To be afflicted with the afflicted, is an instance of humanity, and the demand of good nature and
<PB N="9" REF="028841_0009_0FDD1E1716A21910"/>
good breeding: Pity is but an imaginary aid; and yet, were it not for that, sorrow would be many times utterly insupportable.</P>
<P>MIRTH is by no means a remedy for grief; on the contrary, it raises and inflames it. The only probable way I know of, to soften or cure grief in others, is by putting on an appearance of feel∣ing it yourself; and you must besides, talk fre∣quently and feelingly on the occasion, and praise and blame as the sufferer does; but then remember to make use of the opportunity this condescension and familiarity gives you, of leading him, by de∣grees, into things and passages remote from his present bent of mind, and not unpleasing in them∣selves. In this manner, and by this policy, you will be able to steal him away from his afflictions with his own approbation, and teach him to think and speak of other things than that alone, which frets—or rather WRINGS his heart.</P>
<P>NONE should despair, because God can help them, and none should presume because, God can cross them. A firm trust in the assistance of an Almighty Being naturally produces patience, hope, chearfulness and all other dispositions of mind, that alleviate those calamities which we are not able to remove.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="028841_0010_0FDD1E3216BF93F0"/>
HE who is puffed up with the first gale of pros∣perity, will bend beneath the first blast of adversity.</P>
<P>REPROOF in adversity hath a double sting.</P>
<P>THERE is but one way of fortifying the soul against all gloomy presages and terrors of the mind; and that is, by securing to ourselves the friendship and protection of that being who dis∣poses of events, and governs futurity.</P>
<P>EVENTS which have the appearance of misfor∣tunes, often prove a happy source of future felici∣ty; this consideration should enable us to support affliction with calmness and fortitude.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>ANGER.</HEAD>
<P>AN angry man who suppresses his passions, thinks worse than he speaks, and an angry man that will chide, speaks worse than he thinks. A vindictive temper is not only uneasy to others, but to them that have it.</P>
<P>ANGER may glance into the bosom of a wife man, but rests only in the bosom of fools.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="028841_0011_0FDD1EA3524B6920"/>
IN all things mistakes are excusable; but an error that proceeds from any good principle leaves no room for resentment.</P>
<P>IT was a good method observed by Socrates, when he found in himself any disposition to an∣ger, he would check it by speaking low, in oppo∣sition to the motions of his displeasure.</P>
<P>IT is much better to reprove ingenuously, than to be angry secretly.</P>
<P>HE that waits for an opportunity of acting his revenge, watches to do himself a mischief.</P>
<P>BY taking revenge, a man is but even with his enemy, but by passing it over, he is superior.—</P>
<P>IT is the only valour to remit a wrong; and the greatest applause that I might hurt and would not.</P>
<P>To be able to bear provocation, is an argument of great wisdom; and to forgive it, of a great mind.</P>
<P>THEY who will be angry for any thing, will be angry for nothing.</P>
<P>NONE should be so implacable as to refuse an humble submission. He whose very best actions must be seen with favourable allowance, cannot be too mild, moderate and forgiving.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="028841_0012_0FDD1EA43AA945E0"/>
To pardon faults of error, is but justice to the failings of our nature.</P>
<P>THE noblest remedy for injuries is oblivion. Light injuries are made none by not regarding them.</P>
<P>THERE is no man obliged to live so free from passion, as not in some cases to show some resent∣ment: There are injuries, affronts, &amp;c. that are frequently met with in our tour through life, where it would be rather a stoical stupidity than virtue, to do otherwise: I do not mean revenge, for that must ever be wrong, but a proper resent∣ment, so that the injurer may not be encouraged to commit a second injury.</P>
<P>ONE unquiet disposition distempers the peace and unity of a whole family, or society; as one jarring instrument will spoil a whole concert.</P>
<P>OUR passions are like the seas, agitated by the winds; but as God hath set bounds to these, so should we to those? so far should they go, and no farther.</P>
<P>REASON is given us, by him who breathed in us our immortal part, that in all our actions we should govern ourselves by advice of it.</P>
<P>WE must forget the good we do, for fear of up∣braiding, and religion bids us forget injuries, left
<PB N="13" REF="028841_0013_0FDD1EA5A060B240"/>
the remembrance of them suggest to us a desire of revenge.</P>
<P>HE that is always angry with his sin, shall sel∣dom sin in his anger.</P>
<P>HE that is not above an injury, is below him∣self.</P>
<P>ANGER let loose is one of the most foolish pas∣sions, 'tis no wonder that is generally disappoints itself, and misses its end, by chusing the most vio∣lent means, which are seldom successful.</P>
<P>REASON in anger, is like a ship in the tempest, hurried away by the waves, and often overset.</P>
<P>THE angry man is his own severest tormentor; his breast knows no peace, while his raging pas∣sions are restrained by no sense of either moral or religious duties: What would be his case, if his unforgiving examples were followed by his all∣merciful maker, whose forgiveness he can only hope for, in proportion as he himself forgives and loves his fellow creatures, through the merits and blood of the blessed Jesus.</P>
<P>AN injury unanswered, in course, grows weary of itself, and dies away in a voluntary remorse.—</P>
<P>THINK, when you are enraged at any one, what would probably become your sentiments, should he die during the dispute. Reconciliation is the
<PB N="14" REF="028841_0014_0FDD1EA720A05350"/>
tenderest part either of friendship or love. The sacrificing of our anger to our interest, is often∣times no more than the exchange of a painful pas∣sion for a pleasurable.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>AMBITION AND AVARICE.</HEAD>
<P>AMBITION and Avarice are the two elements that enter into the composition of all crimes. Am∣bition is boundless, and avarice insatiable.</P>
<P>HE that spares in every thing is a niggard; and he who spares in nothing is profuse; neither of which can be generous or liberal.</P>
<P>PITIFUL! that a man should so care for riches, as if they were his own, yet so use them, as if they were another's, that when he might be happy in spending them, will be miserable in keeping them; and had rather, dying, leave wealth to his enemies, than when alive relieve, his friends.</P>
<P>INTEREST speaks all manner of languages, and acts all forts of parts. Virtues are lost in interest, as rivers in the sea.</P>
<P>HISTORY tells us of illustrious villains, but there never was an illustrious miser in nature.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="028841_0015_0FDD1EA89B398350"/>
WHAT madness is it for a man to starve himself to enrich his heir, and so turn a friend into an en∣emy! for his joy at your death will be proportion∣ed to what you leave him.</P>
<P>THE tallest trees are most in the power of the winds, and ambitious men of the blasts of fortune. Great marks are soonest hit.</P>
<P>THE most laudable ambition is, to be wise, and the greatest wisdom to be good.</P>
<P>WE may be as ambitious as we please, so we as∣pire to the best things.</P>
<P>MANY through pride or ambition ruin their for∣tune and family, by expense and equipage, making themselves little by striving to be great, and poor by trying to look rich.</P>
<P>IT is very strange that no estimate is made of any creature except ourselves, but by its proper qualities. He has a magnificent house, so many thousand pounds a year, is the common way of estimating men, though these things are only about them, not in them, and make no part of their char∣acter.</P>
<P>HONOURS, monuments and all the works of vanity and ambition, are demolished and destroy∣ed by time; but the reputation of wisdom is ven∣erable to posterity.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>BEAUTY.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is nothing that gives us so pleasing a prospect of human nature, as the con∣templation of wisdom and beauty. Beauty is an overweaning, self-sufficient thing, careless of pro∣viding itself any more substantial ornament; nay, so little does it consult its own interest, that it too often defeats itself by betraying that innocence which renders it lovely and desirable. As there∣fore virtue makes a beautiful woman appear more beautiful, so beauty makes a virtuous woman really more virtuous.</P>
<P>IT is, methinks, a low and degrading idea of that sex, which was created to refine the joys, and soften the cares of human nature, by the most agreeable participation, to consider them merely as objects of sight. This is abridging them of their natural extent of power, to put them upon a level
<PB N="17" REF="028841_0017_0FDD1EAB9A801690"/>
with their pictures. How much nobler is the con∣templation of beauty heightened by virtue, and commanding our esteem and love, while it draws our observation? How faint and spiritless are the charms of the coquet, when compared with the real loveliness of innocence, piety, good humour, the irresistable charms of modesty unaffected, hu∣manity, with all those rare and pleasing marks of sensibility; virtues, which add a new softness to her sex; and even beautify her beauty.</P>
<P>NOTHING (says Mr. Addison) can atone for the want of modesty and innocence, without which, beauty is ungraceful and quality contemptible.</P>
<P>LET a women be decked with all the embellish∣ments of art and care of nature; yet if boldness be to be read in her face, it blots all the lines of beauty.</P>
<P>THE plainer the dress, with greater lustre does beauty appear: Virtue is the greatest ornament, and good sense the best equipage.</P>
<P>AN inviolable fidelity, good humour and com∣placency of temper in a woman, outlive all the charms of a fine face, and make the decays of it invisible.</P>
<P>IT is but too seldom seen, that beautiful persons are otherwise of great virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="028841_0018_0FDD1EAD1E575968"/>
No beauty hath any charms equal to the inward beauty of the mind. A gracefulness in the man∣ners is much more engaging than that of the per∣son; the former every one has the power to attain to in some measure, the latter is in no one's power,—is no internal worth, and was the gift of God, who formed us all. Meekness and modesty are the true and lasting ornaments.</P>
<LG>
<L>Virtue's the chiefest beauty of the mind,</L>
<L>The noblest ornament of human kind.</L>
</LG>
<P>BEAUTY inspires a pleasing sentiment, which prepossesses people in its favour. Modesty has great advantages, it sets off beauty, and serves as a veil to ugliness. The misfortune of ugliness is, that it sometimes smothers and buries much merit; people do not look for the engaging qualities of the head and heart in a forbidding figure. 'Tis no easy matter when merit must make its way, and shine through a disagreeable outside.</P>
<P>WITHOUT virtue, good sense and sweetness of disposition, the finest set of features will, ere long cease to please; but, where these with the graces are united, it must afford an agreeable and pleasing contemplation.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="028841_0019_0FDD1EAE9D4272B0"/>
THE liberality of nature in the person, is but too frequently attended with a deficiency in the un∣derstanding.</P>
<LG>
<L>Beauty alone, in vain its charms dispense,</L>
<L>The charms of beauty, are the charms of sense.</L>
</LG>
<P>BEAUTY without the graces of the mind, will have no power over the hearts of the wise and good. Beauty is a flower which soon withers, health changes, and strength abates, but innocency is immortal, and a comfort both in life and death.</P>
<LG>
<L>Let us suppose the virtuous mind a rose,</L>
<L>Which nature plants and education blows.</L>
</LG>
<P>MERIT, accompanied with beauty, is a jewel set to advantage.</P>
<LG>
<L>Let virtue prove your never fading bloom,</L>
<L>For mental beauties will survive the tomb.</L>
</LG>
<P>THERE are emanations from the mind, which, like a ray of celestial fire, animate the form of beauty; without these the most perfect symmetry is but a moulded clod; and whenever they appear, the most indifferent features acquire a spirit of sen∣sibility,
<PB N="20" REF="028841_0020_0FDDDA1AB79EA9A8"/>
and an engaging charm, which those only do not admire, who want faculties to discover.—Those strokes of sensibility, those touches of inno∣cence and dignity, &amp;c. display charms too refined for the discernment of vulgar eyes, that are capti∣vated by a glance of beauty, assisted by vivid col∣our and gaudy decoration.</P>

<P>AS benevolence is the most social of all virtues, so it is of the largest extent; for there is not any
<PB N="21" REF="028841_0021_0FDDDA1C38D0E048"/>
man, either so great or so little, but he is yet ca∣pable of receiving benefits.</P>
<P>THE greatest benefits of all, have no witness, but lie concealed in the conscience.</P>
<P>A KIND benefactor makes a man happy as soon as he can, and as much as he can. There should be no delay in a benefit, but the modesty of the re∣ceiver. If we cannot foresee the request, let us however immediately grant it. It is so grievous a thing to say, I beg!—The very word puts a man out of countenance, and it is a double kindness to do the thing, and save an honest heart the confu∣sion of a blush.</P>
<P>LET no one be weary of rendering good offices, for by obliging others, (if our hearts and affections are as they should be) we are really kind to our∣selves. No man was ever a loser by good works; for though he may not be immediately rewarded, yet, in process of time, some happy emergency or other occurs to convince him, that virtuous men are the darlings of Providence.</P>
<P>HE that receives a benefit without being thank∣ful, robs the giver of his just reward. It must be a due reciprocation in virtue that an make the obliger and the obliged worthy.</P>
<P>HE who receives a good turn, should never for∣get it; he who does one should never remember it.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="028841_0022_0FDDDA20896405B0"/>
IT is the character of an unworthy nature, to write injuries in marble, and benefits in dust.</P>
<P>THE following fact, I think, strongly delineates the image of a noble and generous mind, and may justly be ranked among the beauties of STERNE—so deservedly famed for his humanity, sensibility and generosity. A friend of this benevolent <HI>Di∣vine,</HI> being distressed in finances, and whom Sterne wished to relieve, (for Sterne could not be happy while a <HI>friend</HI> was distrest,) but it was not in his power at that time!—Yet,—the <HI>friend!</HI>—a friend must be relieved at all hazards!—"A friend is sacred!"—Sterne finds no rest till 'tis done.—"I was" (says he) "obliged to borrow two hundred pounds beyond my own currency, upon the occasion. I had no sufficient security to proffer; but Captain Le Fevre happened luckily just then, to have sold out of the army—<HI>I mortga∣ged the story to him,</HI> and he lent me the money." The friend and Sterne, were each relieved—Sterne was the happiest of the two.</P>
<P>LET us be careful that we permit no artificial desires to prevent us of the power, in which we shall ever find real pleasure—that of relieving distress.</P>
<P>THAT which is given with pride and oftenta∣tion, is rather an ambition than a bounty. Let a
<PB N="23" REF="028841_0023_0FDDDA216B76F400"/>
benefit be ever so considerable, the manner of con∣ferring it is yet the noblest part.</P>
<P>IT is a good rule for every one who has a competency of fortune, to lay aside a certain pro∣portion of his income for pious and charitable uses; he will then always give easily and chearfully.</P>
<P>IT was well said of him that called a good office that was done harshly, "a stony piece of bread:" It is necessary for him that is hungry to receive it, but it almost chokes him in the going down.</P>
<P>ALPHONSO, king of Scicily, being asked, What he would reserve for himself, who gave so much away? Even those things, said he, that I do give, for the rest I esteem as nothing.</P>
<P>IT is a much greater kindness not to suffer us to fall, than to lend a hand to help us up, and a great∣er satisfaction to be kindly received, and obtain nothing, than obtain what we desire, after having been exposed.</P>
<P>REQUESTS cost a reluctancy in nature, fearing to receive the discourtesy of a denial. That which is bestowed too late, is next to not giving.</P>
<P>MONARCHS are unhappier than their subjects.—For use makes state familiar, and the fatigue grows every day more irksome.—Has opulence and gran∣deur then no advantages? NONE—but the power of doing good. I have often been surprised that so
<PB N="24" REF="028841_0024_0FDDDA2325793F18"/>
little of this kind of manufacture is ever wrought by princes, when the very rarity of the work might serve to render their names famous to posterity. "And paid a tradesman once to make him stare." But away with all ambition, which only affects our names, without improving our natures.</P>
<P>LIBERALITY is never so beautiful or engaging, as when the hand is concealed that bestows the gift.</P>
<P>A noble Lord, who once suffered himself to lose a thousand pounds to a man of modest merit, whom he knew to be greatly necessitated, and to whom he durst not offer it as a gift, surely did a very laudable action, and in which modesty had no small share.</P>

<P>IT is better to go to the house of mourning, than to the house of feasting, says Solomon. Let us go into the house of mourning, made so, by such af∣flictions as have been brought on, merely by the common cross accidents and disasters, to which our condition is exposed—when perhaps—the ag∣ed parents sit, broken hearted, pierced to the soul with the folly and indiscretion of a thankless child—the child of their prayers, in whom all their hopes and expectations centered:—Perhaps a more affecting scene—a virtuous family lying pinched with want, where the unfortunate support of it, having long struggled with a train of misfortunes, and bravely sought up against them—is now pite∣ously borne down at last—overwhelmed with a cruel blow which no forecast or frugality could have prevented.—O God! look upon his afflic∣tions.—Behold him distracted with many sor∣rows, surrounded with the tender pledges of his love, and the partner of his cares—
<PB N="39" REF="028841_0039_0FDDDA4B87CC1030"/>
without bread to give them—unable, from the re∣membrance of better days, to dig;—to beg, asham∣ed. When we enter the house of mourning such as this—it is impossible to insult the unfortunate even with an improper look. Under what levi∣ty and dissipation of heart such objects catch our eye—they catch likewise our attentions, collect and call home our scattered thoughts, and exercise them with wisdom. A transient scene of distress such as is here sketched, how soon does it furnish materials to set the mind at work, how necessarily does it engage it to the consideration of the mise∣ries and misfortunes, the dangers and calamities, to which the life of man is subject! By holding up such a glass before it, it forces the mind to see and reflect upon the vanity—the perishing condition, and uncertain tenor of every thing in this world. Or behold a still more affecting spectacle—a kind indulgent father of a numerous family lies breath∣less,—snatched away in the strength of his age—torn in an evil hour from his children, and the bo∣som of a disconsolate wife! Behold much people of the city gathered together, to mix their tears, with settled sorrow in their looks, going heavily along to the house of mourning, to perform that last sad office, which, when the debt of nature is paid, we are called upon to pay each other!—In this melancholy mansion—see how the light and easy heart, which never knew what it was to
<PB N="40" REF="028841_0040_0FDDDA4B8BA03DF8"/>
think before, how pensive is it now! how soft, how susceptible, how full of religious impressions! how deeply is it smitten with a sense, and with a love of virtue!—Without this end, sorrow, I own, has no use, but to shorten our days, &amp;c.</P>
<P>LET any who is conversant in the vanity of hu∣man life reflect upon it, and he will find—the man life who wants mercy, has a taste for no other en∣joyment of any kind: There is a natural disrelish of every thing which is good in his very nature, and he is born an enemy to the world, he is ever extremely partial to himself, in all his actions, and has no sense of iniquity but from the punish∣ment which shall attend it: The law of the land is his gospel; and all his cases of conscience are determined by his attorney: Such men know not what it is to gladden the heart of the miserable.</P>
<P>HOW shocking to humanity, to see the picture of religion besmeared with superstition, justice blooded with cruelty.</P>
<P>I WILL not attempt to account for those compas∣sionate sentiments we feel for distress, or that in∣dignation which is excited by the appearance of oppression; but I will maintain, that they are the distinguishing honours of human nature; and what philosopher will be such an enemy to society, as to assert the contrary.</P>

CONSCIENCE is a high and awful power, it is next and immediately under God, our Judge; the voice of conscience is the voice of God; what it bindeth or looseneth, is accordingly bound or loosened in heaven, 1 John iii. 21. The greatest deferance and precise obedience is due to its com∣mand. Its consolations are of all, the most sweet: and its condemnations the most terrible.</P>
<P>WHEREVER you go, conscience accompanies you, whatever you say, do, or but think, it regis∣ters and records in order to the day of account; when all friends forsake you, when even your soul forsakes your body, conscience will not, cannot forsake you; when your body is weakest and dul∣lest, your conscience is then most vigorous and active. Never more life in the conscience than when death makes its nearest approach to the body. When it smiles, cheers, acquits and com∣forts, O what a heaven doth it create within; and when it frowns, condemns and terrifies, how are our pleasures, joys and delights of this world clouded, and even benighted! 'tis certainly the best of friends, or the worst of enemies in the whole creation.</P>

A GOOD conscience is to the soul what health is to the body. It preserves a constant ease and se∣renity within us, and more than countervails all the calamities and afflictions that can befal us.</P>
<P>No line holds the anchor of contentment so fast as a good conscience. This cable is so strong and compact, that when force is offered to it, the straining rather strengthens, by uniting the parts more close.</P>
<P>IT fareth with men of an evil conscience, when they must die, as it does with riotous spendthrifts, when they must pay their debts; they will not come to an account, for the distrust they have of their ability to satisfy for what they have done.</P>
<P>MOST men fear a bad name, but few fear their consciences.</P>
<P>NO man ever offended his own conscience, but first or last it was revenged upon him for it.</P>

<HEAD>CONVERSATION.</HEAD>
<P>IT is highly requisite to avoid too much famili∣arity in conversation. It is an old English adage, <HI>"too much familiarity breeds contempt,"</HI> so he that familiarizes himself, presently loses his superiority, that his serious air, and good deportment gave him, and consequently his credit. The more common human things are, the less they are esteemed; for communication discovers imperfections that a prudent reserve concealed. We must not be too familiar with superiors, because of danger; nor with inferiors by reason of indecency; and far less with mean people, whom ignorance renders insolent; for, being insensible of the <HI>honours</HI> done them, they presume it is their due.</P>
<P>IN your discourse be cautious what you speak, and to whom you speak; how you speak, and when you speak; and what you speak, speak
<PB N="53" REF="028841_0053_0FDDDA6DA9825BA8"/>
wisely, speak truly. A fool's heart is in his tongue, but a wise man's tongue is in his heart.</P>
<P>PLUTARCH advises to moderate and correct all base, unworthy and hurtful passions, that in all our conversations we may be open hearted and sincere, and not seek to overreach or deceive others in any of our dealings.</P>
<P>LET all your conversation with men be sober and sincere; your devotion to God dutiful and decent; let the one be hearty and not haughty, let the other be humble, but not homely. So live with men as if God saw you, so pray to God as if men heard you.</P>
<P>NOTHING more engages the affections of men, than a handsome address and graceful conversa∣tion.</P>
<P>OUR conversation should be such, that youth may therein find improvement, women modesty, the aged respect, and all men civility.</P>
<P>TALKATIVENESS is usually called a feminine vice, but it is possible to go into masculine com∣pany, where it will be as hard to wedge in a word as at a female gossoping.</P>
<P>CONTROVERSIES for the most part, leave truth in the middle, and are factious at both ends.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="028841_0054_0FDDDA6E52A25708"/>
VILE and debauched expressions are the sure marks of an abject and grovelling mind, and the filthy overflowing of a vicious heart.</P>
<P>SPEAK always according to your conscience, but let it be done in terms of good nature, civility and good manners.</P>
<P>IT is a sure method of obliging in conversation, to shew a pleasure in giving attention.</P>
<P>AS men of sense say much in few words; so the half witted have a talent of talking much, and yet say nothing.</P>
<P>SOME men are silent for want of matter, or as∣surance; and again some are talkative for want of sense.</P>
<P>MODESTY in your discourse will give a lustre to truth, and an excuse to your errors.</P>
<P>MUCH tongue and much judgment seldom go together, for talking and thinking are two quite different faculties, and there is commonly more depth where there is less noise.</P>
<P>BUFFOONERY and scurrility are the corrupters of wit, as knavery is of wisdom. Some are so black in the mouth, as to utter scarce any thing that is decent; supplying want of sense with want of modesty, and want of reputation with want of shame.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="028841_0055_0FDDDA71E3A6A5E0"/>
IT is a fair step towards happiness and virtue, to delight in the conversation of good and wise men; and where that cannot be had, the next point is, to keep no company at all.</P>
<P>DISCRETION of speech is more than eloquence; and to speak agreeably, is more than to speak in exact order.</P>
<P>THE value of things are not in their size, but quality, and so of reason, which wrapped in few words, hath the greater weight.</P>
<P>A MAN may contemplate on virtue in solitude and retirement; but the practical part consists in its participation, and the society it hath with others; for whatever is good, is the better for being communicable.</P>
<P>THE talent of turning men into ridicule, and exposing those we converse with, is the qualifica∣tion of little ungenerous tempers.</P>
<P>IN disputes men should give soft words, and hard arguments, they should not so much strive to vex, as to convince an enemy.</P>
<P>WHEREVER the speech is corrupted, so is the mind.</P>
<P>IN heat of argument, men are commonly as tho' they were tied back to back, close joined, and yet they cannot see each other.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="028841_0056_0FDDDA746BFA77F8"/>
FAMILIAR conversation ought to be the school of learning and good breeding. A man ought to make his masters of his friends, seasoning the pleas∣ure of converse, with the profit of instruction.</P>
<P>PLEASURE given in society, like money lent to usury, returns with interest to those who disperse it.</P>
<P>MODESTY should be distinguished from an auk∣ward bashfulness, and silence should only be en∣joined when it would be froward and impertinent to talk; if you speak without conceit or affectation, you will always be more pleasing than those who sit like statues without sense or motion. When you are silent, your looks should shew your atten∣tion and presence to the company. You must ap∣pear to be interested in what is said, and endeav∣or improve yourself by it.</P>
<P>CONVERSATION may be divided into two class∣es—the familiar and the sentimental.</P>
<P>IT is the province of the familiar, to diffuse cheerfulness and ease—to open the heart of man to man, and to beam a temperate sunshine upon the mind.</P>
<P>NATURE and art must conspire to render us susceptible of the charms, and to qualify us for the practice of the second class of conversation here termed sentimental.</P>
<P>TO good sense, lively feeling and natural delica∣cy of taste, must be united an expansion of mind,
<PB N="57" REF="028841_0057_0FDDDA762A0F70D8"/>
and a resinement of thought, which is the result of high cultivation. To render this sort of con∣versation irresistably attractive, a knowledge of the world is requisite, and that enchanting ease, that elegance of manner, which is to be acquired only by frequenting the higher circles of polished life. In sentimental conversation, subjects interesting to the heart and to the imagination, are brought for∣ward; they are discussed in a kind of sportive way, with animation and refinement, and are nev∣er continued longer than politeness allows: Here fancy flourishes—the sensibilities expand—and wit guided by delicacy and embellished by taste—points to the heart.</P>

<HEAD>COVETOUSNESS.</HEAD>
<P>LET the fruition of things bless thy possession, and think it more satisfaction to live richly, than to die rich; for since your good works, not your <HI>goods,</HI> will follow you; since wealth is an appur∣tenance of life, and no dead man rich, to famish in plenty and live poorly, to die rich, were but a multiplying in madness, and use upon use in folly.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="028841_0058_0FDDDA79A65EE810"/>
COVETOUSNESS never judges any thing unlaw∣ful, that is gainful.</P>
<LG>
<L>Hence almost every crime, nor do we find</L>
<L>That any passion of the human mind,</L>
<L>So oft has plung'd the soul, or drench'd the bowl,</L>
<L>As avarice—that tyrant of the soul:</L>
<L>For he that would be rich, brooks no delay,</L>
<L>But drives o'er all, and takes the shortest way:</L>
<L>What law, or fear, or shame, can e'er restrain</L>
<L>The greedy wretch in full pursuit of gain.</L>
</LG>
<P>IT is almost a wonder that covetousness, even in spite of itself, does not at some times argue a man into charity, by its own principle of looking for∣wards, and the firm expectation it would delight in, of receiving its own again with usury.</P>
<LG>
<L>Oh! impudence of wealth! with all thy store,</L>
<L>How dar'st thou let one worthy man be poor.</L>
</LG>
<P>IT is a much easier task to dig metal out of its native mine, than to get it out of the covetous man's coffer. Death only has the key of the mi∣ser's chest. A miser, if honest, can only be hon∣est bare weight.</P>
<LG>
<L>If wealth alone can make or keep us blest,</L>
<L>Still, still be getting, never, never rest.</L>

CONSCIENCE and covetousness are never to be reconciled, like fire and water they always destroy each other, according to the predominancy of ei∣ther.</P>
<P>THE only gratification a covetous man gives his neighbours, is, to let them see that he himself is as little the better for what he has, as they are.</P>
<P>AVARICE is the most opposite of all characters to that of God Almighty, whose alone it is, to give and not receive.</P>

<HEAD>COURAGE.</HEAD>
<P>ALL true Courage is derived from virtue, and honour from integrity.</P>
<P>IF you desire to be magnanimous, undertake nothing rashly, and fear nothing you undertake; fear nothing but infamy, dare any thing but injury.
<PB N="60" REF="028841_0060_0FDDDA7C5BED5A60"/>
The measure of magnanimity is to be neither rash nor timorous; for magnanimity or true courage, which is an essential character in a soldier, is not a savage ferocious violence—not a fool hardy in∣sensibility of danger, or head strong rashness to run into it; not the fury of inflamed passions, broke loose from the government of reason—but a calm, deliberate, rational courage, a steady, judic∣ious, thoughtful fortitude; the courage of a man, and not that of a tyger.</P>
<LG>
<L>Let us appear, nor rash, nor indifferent,</L>
<L>Immoderate valour swells into a fault;</L>
<L>And fear admitted into public councils,</L>
<L>Betrays like treason, Let us shun them both.</L>
</LG>
<P>COURAGE certainly is of no sex, but a faculty of the soul; and however custom may depress, or discourage it in females, it certainly belongs to hu∣man nature in general. If men possess a more de∣termined courage in perils, which they foresee, women are allowed to be blessed with a superior presence of mind in sudden dangers; and, per∣haps, the latter is one of the most distinguishing characteristics of real courage.</P>

<HEAD>CHARITY.</HEAD>
<P>CHARITY makes the best construction of things and persons, excuses weakness, extenuates miscarriages, makes the best of every thing, for∣gives every one, and serves all.</P>
<P>IN order to our final doom and sentence, we need but this one enquiry, whether we were char∣itable or uncharitable? For they who are possessed with a true divine charity, have all christian graces. They who have not this divine principle have no good in them, and that is enough to con∣demn them, without enquiring what evil they have done.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="028841_0062_0FDDDA81690A8BC8"/>
WHEN a compassionate man falls, who would not pity him! Who that had power to do it, would not befriend and raise him up? Or could the most barbarous tempter offer an insult to his distress, without pain and reluctance? True charity is al∣ways unwilling to find excuses;—in generous spirits, compassion is sometimes an over balance for self preservation: God certainly interwove that friendly softness in our nature, to be a check upon too great a propensity towards self love.</P>
<P>UNDER the gospel, God is pleased with a living sacrifice; but the offerings of the dead, such as testamentary charities are, which are intended to have no effect so long as we live, are no better than dead sacrifices; and it may be questioned, whether they will be brought into the account of our lives, if we do no good while we are living. These death bed charities, are too like a death bed repentance; men seem to give their estates to God and the poor, just as they part with their sins—when they can keep them no longer.</P>
<P>CHARITY obliges us not to distrust a man, pru∣dence not to trust a man before we know him.</P>
<P>THE first duty of man next to that of worship∣ping the Deity, is, ministering to the necessities of his fellow creatures.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="028841_0063_0FDDDA84F0F62E00"/>
ARE we not all citizens of the world? Are we not all fellow subjects of the universal monarch? Is not the universe our home? And is not every man a brother? Poor and illiberal is that charity which is confined to any particular nation or society.—Should we not <HI>feel for the stranger, and him that hath no helper?</HI></P>
<P>HE who is charitable from motives of ostenta∣tion, will never relieve distress in secret.</P>

<P>DESTINY has decreed all men to die; but to die well is the particular privilege of the virtuous and good.</P>
<P>AS there is no covenant to be made with death, so, no agreement for the arrest and stay of time: It keeps its pace, whether we redeem and use it well or not.</P>
<P>HE that has given God his worship, and man; his due, is entertained with comfortable presages, wears off smoothly and expires in pleasure.</P>
<P>DEATH is no more than turning us over from time to eternity. It leads to immortality, and that is recompense enough for suffering it.</P>

They who die well have lived long enough; as soon as death enters upon the stage, the tragedy of life is done. There are a great many miseries which nothing but death can give relief to. This puts an end to the sorrows of the afflicted and dis∣tressed. It sets prisoners at liberty; it dries up the tears of the widows and the fatherless; it eases the complaints of the hungry and naked; it tames the proudest tyrants, and puts an end to all our labours: And the contemplation on it, supports men under their present adversities, espe∣cially when they have a prospect of a better life after this.</P>
<LG>
<L>Learn to live well, that thou may'st die so too;</L>
<L>To live and die is all we have to do.</L>
</LG>
<P>HAVE we so often seen ourselves die in our friends, and shall we shrink at our own change? Hath our Maker sent for us, and are we loth to go? It was for us our saviour triumphed over death. Is there then any fear of a foiled adver∣sary?</P>

</LG>
<P>ALL our knowledge, our employments, our riches and our honours, must end in death; so that we must seek a sanctuary of happiness some where else.</P>
<P>WHEN the scene of life is shut up, the slave will be above his master, if he has acted a better part; thus nature and condition are once more brought to a balance.</P>
<P>HOW poor will power, wealth, honour, fame and titles seem at our last hour? and how joyful will that man be, who hath led an honest, virtu∣ous life, and travelled to heaven, though through the roughest ways of poverty, affliction and con∣tempt.</P>

Every night before I address myself to my Creator, I lay my hand upon my heart, and ask myself, whether, if God should require my soul of me this night, I could hope for mercy from him. The bitter agonies
<PB N="69" REF="028841_0069_0FDDDA936DC37058"/>
I underwent in this my first acquaintance with myself, were so far from throwing me into despair of that mercy which is over all God's works, that it proved motives of greater circumspection in my future conduct. The oftener I exercised myself in meditations of this kind, the less was my anxiety; and by making the thoughts of death familiar, what was at first so terrible and shooking, is now become the sweetest of my enjoyments. These contemplations have indeed made me serious, but not sullen; nay, they are so far from having sour∣ed my temper, that I have a mind perfectly com∣posed, and a secret spring of joy in my heart;—I taste all the innocent satisfaction of life pure, as I have no share in pleasures that leave a sting behind them.</P>

POSTERITY wisely regulates the rewards due to men of learning, and equals them to the greatest princes: Three thousand years after their death, their honour is not tarnished by that of the greatest heroes. Homer is as well known as Achilles. The able historian, the famous poet, the great—the pious and ingenious philosopher have an advan∣tage over the conqueror and the general. Twenty centuries after they are dead and rotten they speak with as much eloquence and vivacity as when liv∣ing; and all that read their writings perceive their genius. The heroes who have rendered themselves famous by their actions, have not near such an as∣cendant over our hearts; for he, at one and the same instant, persuades, engages and captivates the heart of one man shut up in his closet at Stockholm, and of another that lives in the middle of Paris, London, &amp;c. &amp;c. Heroes are infinitely obliged to poets and historians, but the latter are seldom be∣holden to the former. Achilles owes part of his glory to Homer: If there had been no historians, it would scarce have been known that there ever was such a man as Alexander, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>EDUCATION is the ruling motive in most of the actions of mankind; they are more or less tractable, according as they have been more or less cultivated in their youth. When they have been taught early to render themselves sociable, to bend
<PB N="74" REF="028841_0074_0FDDDA9FC7CC71D8"/>
their tempers, and to accomodate their wills to those of others, it grows into a custom, and they become insensibly complaisant, without thinking of being so. In short, habit is to them a second nature.</P>
<P>WE should justly consider religion as the most essentially necessary qualification, at the same time children should be fitted for an appearance becom∣ing their station in this world. Many are apt to disjoin the ideas of piety and politeness, but true religion is not only consistent with, but <HI>necessary to</HI> the perfection of true politeness.</P>
<P>THE end of learning is, to know God, and, in consequence of that knowledge to love him, and to imitate him, as we may the nearer, by possess∣ing ourselves of virtue.</P>
<P>WHAT sculpture is to a block of marble, edu∣cation is to the human soul. The philosopher, the saint, the hero, the wise, the good, or the great man very often lie hid and concealed in a ple∣beian; which a proper education might have dis∣interred and brought to light.</P>
<P>THE educator's care should be, above all things to lay in his charge the foundation of religion and virtue.</P>
<P>PARENTS are more careful to bestow wit on their children, than virtue; the art of speaking

well, rather than doing well; but their morals ought to be their greatest concern.</P>
<P>AN industrious and virtuous education of chil∣dren is a better inheritance for them than a great estate. To what purpose is it, said Crates, to heap up estates, and have no care what kind of heirs they leave them to?</P>

<P>TRUE philosophy, says Plato, consists more in fidelity, constancy, justice, sincerity and in the love of our duty, than in a great capacity.</P>
<P>If our painful peregrination in studies be desti∣tute of the supreme light, it is nothing else but a a miserable kind of wandering.</P>
<P>THE mind ought sometimes to be diverted, that it may turn to thinking the better.</P>
<P>LEARNING is the dictionary, but sense the gram∣mar of science. Poetry is inspiration—it was

breathed into the soul, when it first quickened, and should neither be styled art nor science, but genius.</P>
<P>GREAT men are always reserved and modest, and being content with meriting praise, do not endeavour to court it; and for this they are the more praise worthy, because if vanity <HI>is</HI> pardonable, it is in the man who deserves those shining com∣pliments, which are so becoming to many learned men. 'Tis said, that Racine was a whole year in composing his tragedy of Phaedra, the master piece of the theatre, and before he committed it to the stage, consulted his friends a long time, corrected several passages by their advice, and waited for the success of his performance before he would presume to pronounce it a good one. Prado wrote the same in a month's time; gave it out boldly to be acted, and assured the public it was an excel∣lent piece. But it happened to him as it often does to all half witted authors; his work quickly went to the chandler's shops, whereas Racine's will reach to the latest posterity.</P>
<P>GREAT talents, such as honour, virtue, learning and parts, are above the generality of the world who neither possess them themselves, nor judge of them rightly in others: But all people are judges of the lesser talents, such as civility, affability and an obliging agreeable address and manner: Be∣cause
<PB N="77" REF="028841_0077_0FDDDAA579FD5A28"/>
they feel the good effects of them, as mak∣ing society easy and pleasing.</P>
<P>ALMOST all the advantages or miscarriages of our lives depend, in a great measure, upon our education. Therefore it is greatly the duty of all who have in <HI>any</HI> way the inspection of this impor∣tant affair, by every means possible, to win young minds to improvement; to the end that good parts may not take an evil turn, nor indifferent ones be totally lost for want of industrious cultivation.</P>
<P>EDUCATION, when it works upon an ingenious mind, brings out to view every latent perfection, which, without such helps are never able to make their appearance. And, if we take the trouble to look round, we shall find very few, to whom na∣ture has been such a niggard of her gifts, that they are not capable of shining in one sphere of science or another: Since then there is a certain bias to∣wards knowledge, in almost every mind, which may be strengthened and improved by proper care; sure parents and others should consider, that, in the neglect of so essential a point, they do not com∣mit a private injury only, as thereby they starve pos∣terity, and defraud our country of those persons, who, under better management, might perhaps make an eminent figure.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="028841_0078_0FDDDAA9300ACC30"/>
INDEED, the difference in the manners and abil∣ities of men proceeds more from education, than from any imperfections or advantages derived from their original formation.</P>
<P>YOUTH moreover is the proper and only season for education; for if it be neglected then, it will surely be in vain to think of remedying the over∣sight in more advanced years; it will be too late to think of sowing it, when maturity has rendered the mind stubborn and inflexible, and when, in∣stead of receiving the seeds, it should be bringing forth the fruits of instruction.</P>
<P>BUT there is one point in the article of educa∣tion, which is more essential than any of the rest: I mean the great care that ought to be taken to form youth to the principles of religion. Vice, if we may believe the general complaint, grows so ma∣lignant now a days, that it is almost impossible to keep young people from the spreading contagion; if we venture them abroad, and trust to chance or inclination, for the choice of their company; it is therefore virtue, and a perfect sense of their duty to God, which is the great and valuable thing to be taught them. All other considerations and accom∣plishments should give way, and be postponed, to these; these are the solid and substantial good we should labour to implant and fasten on their minds, neither should we cease till we have attained a
<PB N="79" REF="028841_0079_0FDDDAAC87BAE5A8"/>
true relish for them, and placed their strength, their glory and their <HI>pleasure in them.</HI></P>
<P>IT is also of the first consequence in training up youths of both sexes, that they be early inspir∣ed with humanity, and particularly that its princi∣ples be implanted strongly in their yet tender hearts, to guard them against inflicting wanton pain on those animals, which use or accident may occasionally put into their power.</P>

<Q><L>—Malicious envy rode</L>
<L>Upon a venomous wolf, and still did chew</L>
<L>Between his canker'd teeth a ven'mous toad,</L>
<L>That all the poison ran about his jaw:</L>
<L>But inwardly he chew'd his own maw</L>
<L>At neighbours' wealth, that made him ever sad:</L>
<L><PB N="80" REF="028841_0080_0FDDDAAE67B6A810"/>
For death it was, when any good he saw,</L>
<L>And wept, that cause of weeping none he had;</L>
<L>But when he heard of harm he waxed wond'rous glad.</L>
<L>He hated all good works, and virtuous deeds,</L>
<L>And him no less than any like did use;</L>
<L>And who with gracious bread the hungry feeds,</L>
<L>His aims, for want of faith, he doth accuse,</L>
<L>So every good to bad he doth abuse;</L>
<L>And eke the verse of famous poet's wit</L>
<L>He does backbite, and spiteful poison spews.</L>
<L>From lep'rous mouth, on all that ever writ:</L>
<L>Such one vile envy was.</L></Q></P>
<P>VIRTUE is not secure against envy. Men will <HI>lessen</HI> what they will not imitate. It is observed that the most censorious are generally the least ju∣dicious; who having nothing to recommend themselves, will be finding fault with others.</P>
<P>NONE envy the merit of others, but who have little—or none at all themselves. He that envies, makes another man's virtue his vice, and another man's happiness his torment, whereas he that re∣joices at the prosperity of another, is partaker thereof.</P>
<P>SOME people as much envy others a good name, as they want it themselves, and perhaps that is the reason of it.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="028841_0081_0FDDDAB1149F9638"/>
ENVY is a passion so full of cowardice and shame, that none have the confidence to own it.</P>
<P>ENVY is fixed only on merit; and, like a sore eye, is offended with every thing that is bright.</P>
<P>A MAN that hath no virtue in himself, envieth it in others.</P>
<LG>
<L>The man who envies, must behold with pain</L>
<L>Another's joys, and sicken at his gain:</L>

<HEAD>FRIENDSHIP.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>Friendship's a name to few confin'd,</L>
<L>The offspring of a noble mind;</L>
<L>A generous warmth which fills the breast,</L>
<L>And better felt than e'er exprest.</L>
</LG>
<P>FRIENDSHIP is a sweet attraction of the heart, towards the merit we esteem, or the perfections we admire; and produces a mutual inclination
<PB N="84" REF="028841_0084_0FDDDAB6D998C7B8"/>
between two persons, to promote each others in∣terest, knowledge, virtue and happiness.</P>
<P>THERE'S nothing so common as pretences to friendship; though few know what it means, and fewer yet come up to its demands. By talking of it, we set ourselves off; but when we enquire in∣to it, we see our defects; and when we engage in it, we must charge through abundance of difficul∣ty. The veneration it has challenged in every age, (the most barbarous not excepted) is a stand∣ing testimony of its excellence: And the more valuable it is, the more are we concerned to be instructed in it.</P>
<P>MONSIEUR DE SAOY in his essay upon friend∣ship, treats to this effect: The friendship which is to be recommended, is union of affections, springing from a generous respect to virtue, and is maintained by a harmony of manners. It is a great mistake to call every trifling commerce by this serious name; or to suppose that empty com∣pliments and visits of ceremony, when no more is intended than to pass the time, and shew the equipage, should pass for a real and well establish∣ed friendship. The frequency of the practice will not wipe off the absurdity:—There is as wide a difference between a bully and a man of honour.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="028841_0085_0FDDDABA32EABAA0"/>
NOT that these amusements are to be found fault with, the innocence and convenience of which protects them, when they pass for nothing but what they are; but certainly they ought to be distinguished from their betters; and the language and professions bear a proportion to the real im∣pression they have on our heart.</P>
<P>CONFORMITY of inclination is the life of friend∣ship.</P>
<P>WHILST all are pursuing this common interest, all are travelling the same course, nothing can break the union of their affections and desires. The danger is only from irregular motions, and forgetting from which they should act. So long as we maintain a respect to this principle of union, and keep virtue on the throne, our humour and caprice will be checked and subdued. If interest can maintain and form societies, as we find it does, why should not those who are actuated by a higher principle, (and with such only is our busi∣ness) do as much, if not more.</P>
<P>IT may be said, from hence I conclude that all good men are friends, if virtue be the life of friend∣ship. The consequence holds good as far as esteem goes, if they knew one another, they would value one another. But though friendship is founded on esteem, so much that it cannot otherways subsist,
<PB N="86" REF="028841_0086_0FDDDABB29F96450"/>
there goes however, something more to form it, esteem is a tribute due to merit in general; but friendship is an improvement made upon merit, and engages us in a very different degree.</P>
<P>SUCH impression has been made upon the heart as cannot be well described, and works like a mother's affection to her own children, above those of strangers, as amiable in themselves. Those who would have friendship confined to the nar∣rowest compass, have notions of it the most sub∣lime; though number, if practicable, may be high∣ly useful.</P>
<P>FOR to have but one friend, may sometimes be to have none, or, which is the same thing, none when we want him. The circumstances of time, and place and ability too, make it proper that we have more than one bottom to venture in. The offices of friendship are various, to direct our choice, and rectify our mistakes; to sustain our misfortunes, moderate our joys and the like. This may possibly be better done by the care and en∣deavours of several. Not that I would have friend∣ship governed by profit and convenience, a mo∣tive so mean can produce nothing extraordinary. There is something generous in the composition, that looks at another man's advantage as much as his own.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="028841_0087_0FDDDABF5D50FD58"/>
AND that we may not talk without a precedent for what we say, the sages of old, whose friendships were so well cultivated, and became so famous as to be handed down to the present time, even theirs were divided into several streams. The most po∣lite nations, and their <HI>philosephers</HI> too, gave us examples of that sort to build upon. It were dif∣ficult to determine, just how many make a sufficient quantity of friends, some fix the number to three, others allowing a greater latitude, but this rule will serve us, <HI>the fewer the better;</HI> and he who thinks he has a great number of friends, has most reason to believe he has none. It was a good re∣turn of Socrates, when his house was thought too little "Would to God I could fill it with true friends;" said he: After all, if one should have a barn full, one would wish for no more than a closet would hold. Let the matter at least turn upon this, setting aside the reasons I have offered:—The dif∣ficulty we shall find in the choice of our friends, will make us rejoice we have but few to chuse, Of such importance is the work, 'tis so hard to succeed, and so dangerous to miscarry, so severe an inquiry into the inclination and merits of the per∣son, and the experience we must run through, be∣fore we are safe in their hands, will convince us, that to gain three or four in the course of our life, is to employ it well. Whence is it, so many friend∣ships
<PB N="88" REF="028841_0088_0FDDDAC066F16028"/>
clapt up on a sudden, which have the air of a veteran, not of a raw, undisciplined affection; and look like the meeting of old friends, not of new ones; whence can it be, these so promising, and kindly advances should so soon be overturned? 'tis because they began too soon, and run up too fast: And is there any mystery in this, that time should destroy what we set up without consulting him? We meet, and at first sight like one anoth∣er well, the next thing is to say so, the next in course to be <HI>dear friends.</HI> We vow and swear eter∣nal amity; and when we go to considering, we find him out; we grow cool;—and at length come to hate him. We swing ourselves up by main force, and our own weight brings us down again. Would you contract a friendship that should last a long time, be a long time in contracting it.</P>
<P>PLUTARCH thus describes the person a friend should be. As to the person of whom we are to make a friend, he must be endowed with virtue, as a thing in itself lovely and desirable, which consists of a sweet and obliging temper of mind, a lively readiness in doing good offices; than which qual∣ifications, nothing is more rarely found in nature. To this a familiar conversation must be added, for the person whom we desire to make our friend, must not casually be picked up at a tavern, or an
<PB N="89" REF="028841_0089_0FDDDAC3E76776A0"/>
eating house, nor at a promiscuous meeting at a horse race; but one chosen upon long and mature deliberation, confirmed by settled converse, and with whom, as the proverb says, "<HI>we have eaten a bushel of salt.</HI>"</P>
<P>FROM a vicious man I should desire to stand off altogether. By a vicious man I do not mean one liable to failings, as all men are, but one that acts without any regard to honour and conscience. He's out of his element that makes an engagement that is not supported only by principles of virtue. True friendship justly founded is a blessing, in which virtue has the sole property. And, as vir∣tue has but few temporal rewards to propose, those few are to be found no where else.</P>
<P>EQUALITY of birth and fortune, is by some made a point necessary to a well instructed friendship, and it must be said the rule ever to be embraced, if we could, when we pleased, find as good men of our own rank, as else where. But considering there are but few of any rank fit to be chosen, we should look at the solid foundation of merit, and pass by mere accomplishments. We make no league with the coat of arms and liveries, but the man, and with that part of the man too, that is considered abstractly from both. These things are not fixed to the freehold.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="028841_0090_0FDDDAC4E8B24620"/>
NOT but that one should carry it with that dis∣tance and regard which is due to persons of con∣dition. If they condescend to lay aside their state there is no reason we should take advantage of the level. One would presume farther upon the be∣haviour of a man genteelly bred, than another that wanted that advantage. But, on the other hand, there are instances to be met with, of such as have our stretched expectation, as well as those that have fallen short of it. These should be looked upon with as much favour, and more, for having hammered out themselves into the perfections they have.</P>

THE general duty of a friend is, an industrious pursuit of his friend's real advantages; fidelity in his trusts, assistance in all his wants, and a con∣stant endeavour for his advancement in piety and virtue, for so close is the connection, that this is the expression of GOD himself speaking of a friend: THY FRIEND, WHICH IS AS THINE OWN SOUL, Deut, xiii. 6.</P>
<P>REVENGE (says de Sacy) which is never to be indulged, is between friends, most of all a crime, and yet it will sometimes creep in, under the dis∣guise of justice; and here the easiness of revenge may encourage us to it. We know the man to the bottom, and can therefore injure him a hun∣dred ways; but, this is ungenerous—inhuman! All that we can honourably allow ourselves in, is to shew, by a genteel behaviour, what he has lost, who has forfeited our friendship; by our gener∣ous conduct, to discover the fault is his, and make him suffer in the reproach of his own breast. To be unconcerned at his misfortunes, or success; to look upon him with the aversion of an enemy, is passion and not just resentment. His betraying your secrets will not justify you in exposing his. You will meet with more favourable opinion from the best of men, while you are so generous to suf∣fer rather than retaliate. Whereas they will
<PB N="92" REF="028841_0092_0FDDDAC9A8959E30"/>
think you deserve such usage, if you can allow it in yourself. There is no relief but patience, ad∣mitting it otherwise, you open a door to all man∣ner of disorder. Friendship has no sting to re∣venge affronts with, the remorse which a guilty person feels, and the disgrace he meets with abroad, if his character be known, is the punish∣ment we should content ourselves with inflicting.</P>
<P>AMONG the friends we should cast off, I reckon those that stick as long as fortune is kind, but turn with the tide and keep at a distance, those flies that follow the honey pot while there is some∣thing to be had, and take leave when there is no more to be hoped for. A true friend may be for∣given, if in time of prosperity he seem to neglect you, but he is not worth having, who neglects you in distress; for 'tis then his duty comes on, when things go against you; to sustain and comfort you when you are in trouble; and to bear a part of your burden.</P>
<P>WE think we come up to the highest pitch of friendship, when our purse is open to our friend. It is true, comparatively reckoning, he is a gener∣ous man that will do so much; but that is not enough, if to part with our money to those who profess an affection for, be the highest piece of friendship, pray what must the lowest be? Is it such a mighty piece of business to do that for the dearest person
<PB N="93" REF="028841_0093_0FDD1DC493B34238"/>
on earth, which we do to gratify a vain humour? What common humanity or applause will put us upon, surely, amongst friends, is not to be reckon∣ed an act of transcendent kindness, when it is no more than giving to another self, and paying of debts. Is there any thing more certainly a due, than what we are engaged to by the alliance of friendship: Let a man incur the displeasure of his superiors, and warmly embark in my service, I will own such a man to be a friend indeed, gen∣erous and affectionate, one cannot praise him too much. Let him open his purse to one he loves, this comes short of the other. A man of honour upon a slender friendship, will do as much as this. To cry up the parting with our pence, for the highest sacrifice that can be paid to friendship, is the sign of a grovelling spirit, that knows not what is truly noble. The people of old had bet∣ter notions of the matter, who would borrow to give others in distress, and think they had done no more than their duty.</P>
<P>WHEREFORE, he that fails in this point, is not worth our acquaintance, he that deserts a man to save his pocket, will never hazard life and reputa∣tion in his service. Virtue is the principle of union, but vice is often strong enough to make a separation. Adversity is a time to try how sincere the professions were, if they pass that test we may depend upon them.</P>

<P>FRIENDSHIP has a noble effect upon all acci∣dents and conditions, it relieves our cares, raises our hopes and abates our fears. A friend who relates his success, talks himself into a new pleas∣ure; and by opening his misfortunes, leaves part of them behind him.</P>
<P>ALL men have their frailties, whoever looks for a friend without imperfections will never find what he seeks; we love ourselves with all our faults and we ought to love our friend in like manner.</P>
<P>WHOEVER moves you to part with a true and tried friend, has certainly a design to make way for a treacherous enemy.</P>
<P>HE is happy that finds a true friend in extrem∣ity; but he is much more so, who findeth not ex∣tremity whereby to try his friend.</P>
<P>FRIENDSHIP is the most sacred of all mortal bonds. Trusts of confidence, tho' without any express stipulation or caution, are yet, in the very
<PB N="99" REF="028841_0099_0FDDDADB6F7A0998"/>
nature of them, as sacred as if they were guarded by a thousand articles of conditions.</P>
<P>A TRUE and faithful friend is a living treasure, a comfort in solitude, and a sanctuary in distress.</P>

<L>Of the spring—in nature's fairest form—is augh so fair</L>
<L>As virtuous friendship, or the graceful tear</L>
<L>That streams from others woes?</L>
</LG>
<P>SOME cases are so nice, that a man cannot ap∣pear in them himself, but must leave the soliciting wholly to his friend. For the purpose, a man cannot recommend himself without vanity, nor ask many times without uneasiness; but a kind proxy will do justice to his merits, relieve his modesty, and effect his business without trouble or blushing.</P>
<P>AN enemy may receive hurt by our hatred; but a friend will suffer a greater injury by our dissimulation.</P>
<P>THERE is requisite to friendship more goodness and virtue, than dexterity of wit, or height of understanding; it being enough, that they have sufficient prudence to be as good as they should be, in order to the completing of a virtuous friend∣ship.</P>

There is indeed no blessing in life that is any way com∣parable to the enjoyment of a discreet and virtuous friend.

Of all affectations, there is none so firm and noble, as when virtuous hearts are linked together by a correspondence of manners, and freedom of conversation.</P>
<P>THE rare qualities of friendship are virtue, pi∣ety, good sense; thereon are founded admiration and esteem—and sensibility must support it.</P>
<P>A FRIEND is a precious jewel, within whose bosom we may unload our sorrows, and unfold our secrets.</P>
<P>IT will be very fit for all that have entered in∣to any strict friendship, to make one special arti∣cle in the agreement, That they shall mutually admonish and reprove each other.</P>

<HEAD>GRATITUDE.</HEAD>
<P>O! HOW amiable is gratitude! espec∣ially when it has the supreme benefactor for it, object. I have always looked upon gratitude as the most exalted principle that can actuate the
<PB N="102" REF="028841_0102_0FDD1DCC1165D798"/>
heart of man. It has something in it noble, dis∣interested, and (if I may be allowed the term) gen∣erously devout. Repentance indicates our nature fallen, and prayer returns chiefly upon a regard of one's self. But the exercise of gratitude subsisted in Paradise, when there was no fault to deplore; and will be perpetuated in heaven, when God shall be "all in all."</P>
<P>DEMOSTHENES said, it becometh him, who re∣ceiveth a benefit from another man, for ever to be sensible of it, but him that bestowed it, presently to forget it. He is unjust, said Socrates who does not return deserved thanks for any benefit, wheth∣er he be a friend or a foe.</P>
<P>THERE is no vice nor failing of man, that doth so much unprinciple humanity, as ingratitude: Since he who is guilty of it lives unworthy of his own soul, that hath not virtue enough to be obliged nor to acknowledge the true merits of the obliger.</P>
<P>IT is a common thing for gratitude to be for∣getful, as for hope to be mindful.</P>
<P>WITHOUT good nature and gratitude, man had as well live in a wilderness, as in a civil society.</P>
<P>HE who receives a good turn, should never for∣get it, he who does one, should never remember it.</P>
<P>IT is the character of an unworthy nature, to write injuries in marble, and benefits in dust.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="028841_0103_0FDDDADEE44E6B18"/>
HE that preaches gratitude, plead<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the cause both of God and man, for without it we can nei∣ther be sociable nor religious.</P>
<P>IT is the glory of gratitude, that it depends on∣ly on the good will: If I have will to be grateful, says Senecca, I am so.</P>
<P>IF gratitude is due from man to man, how much more from man to his maker? The Supreme Be∣ing does not only confer upon us those bounties which proceed more immediately from his hand, but even those benefits which are conveyed to us by others. Every blessing we enjoy, by what means soever it may be derived upon us, is the gift of him who is the great author of good, and Father of mercies.</P>
<P>GRATITUDE, when exerted towards one anoth∣er, naturally produces a very pleasing sensation in the mind of a grateful man; it exalts the soul in∣to rapture, when it is employed in this great ob∣ject of gratitude; on this beneficent Being who has given us every thing we already possess, and from whom we expect every thing we hope for.</P>

<P>GOOD nature is the very air of a good mind, the sign of a large and generous soul, the peculiar soil on which virtue prospers. There is far more satisfaction in doing, than receiving good.

<P>WE read a pretty passage (says Philologus) of a certain Cardinal, who, by the multitude of his gen∣erous actions, gave occasion for the world to call him "The patron of the poor." This ecclesiastic prince had a constant custom once or twice a week, to give public audience to all indigent people in the hall of his palace, and to relieve every one accord∣ing to their various necessities, or the motions of his own bounty. One day a poor widow, encour∣aged by the fame of his generosity, came into the hall of this cardinal, with her only child, a beau∣tiful maid, about fifteen years of age. When her turn came to be heard, among a croud of petition∣ers, the cardinal discerning the marks of an extra∣ordinary modesty in her face and carriage, as also on her daughter, encouraged her to tell her wants freely—she blushing—and, not without tears, thus addressed herself to him. "My lord, I owe for the rent of my house, five crowns, and
<PB N="106" REF="028841_0106_0FDDDAE4691D0258"/>
such is my misfortune, that I have no other means to pay it, save what would break my heart, since my landlord threatens to force me to it; that is, to prostitute my only daughter, whom I have hither∣to with great care, educated in virtue.—What I beg of your eminence is, that you would please to interpose your authority, and protect us from the violence of this cruel man, till, by our honest in∣dustry, we can procure the money for him." The cardinal, moved with admiration at the woman's virtue and innocent modesty, bade her be of good courage; then he immediately wrote a billet, and giving it into the widow's hands, Go, said he, to my steward, and he shall deliver thee five crowns to pay thy rent. The poor woman overjoyed, and returning the cardinal a thousand thanks, went directly to his steward—and gave him the note, which when he had read, told her out fifty crowns. She, astonished at the meaning of it, and fearing it was the steward's trick to try her honesty, refused to take above five, saying, she mentioned no more to tho cardinal; and she was sure it was some mis∣take. On the other side, the steward insisted on his master's order, not daring to call it in question. But all the arguments he could use were insuffic∣ient to prevail on her to take more than five crowns. Wherefore, to end the controversy, he offered to go back with her to the cardinal, and refer it to him. When they came before that mu∣nificent

There upon he wrote again; saying this to the woman, "So much candour and virtue deserves a recompense. Here I have ordered you five hundred crowns. What you can spare of it, lay up as a dowry to give with your daughter in marriage.</P>

<P>ONE of those that had escaped death, replied to him that was lamenting his fate. "Friend, I have neither father nor mother; my life is of no use to any one; give me your lot, and take mine."

<HEAD>HONOUR.</HEAD>
<P>TRUE honour, (says Dr. Hildrup) is seated in the soul. It is a kind of <HI>sons-persennis</HI> rising from a generous heart, and flowing with a natural and easy descent into all the different traces of life, and channels of duty; refreshing, invigorating, and adorning all the faculties of the soul, language of the tongue, the very air of the face, and motion of
<PB N="112" REF="028841_0112_0FDDDAF56B677B10"/>
the body. It displays itself in a natural unaffected greatness and firmness of mind, improved by a train of wise and religious reflections, and generous ac∣tions, in which personal virtue and real merit tru∣ly consist.</P>
<P>THE bulk of mankind are caught by shew. The pompous sound of titles, and glitter of orna∣ments strike their senses, attract their attention, raise their admiration, and extort from them all that reverence which is due only to eminent and distingished merit; while real virtue and true honour pass silently through the world, unheeded and unregarded, but by the happy and discern∣ing few, who are sensible of its merit, or enjoy the blessed communication of its influence.</P>
<P>FOR to do good, to be lovers of mankind, to alleviate the distresses, and promote the peace and happiness of our fellow creatures, is the highest honour, the noblest ambition that can enter into the heart of man. But the bulk of mankind judge otherwise. Noise and shew, title and equipage, glitter and grandeur, constitute the whole idea of honour; and whoever can command an interest sufficient to procure, and an affluence sufficient to support them, becomes thereby not only a man of honour, but even a subordinate fountain of honour, enabled to produce others after his kind, and
<PB N="113" REF="028841_0113_0FDDDAF72BAC05F0"/>
propagate the <HI>honourable</HI> species from generation to generation.</P>
<P>THE man of honour is an internal, the person of honour an external; the one a real the other a fictitious character. I am therefore never surpriz∣ed to see or hear such things attempted, said, and done by a person of honour, which a man of hon∣our would blush to think of.</P>
<P>A PERSON of honour may be a prophane irre∣ligious libertine; a penurious, proud, revengeful coward; may insult his inferiors, oppress his tenants and servants, debauch his neighbours wives and daughters, defraud his creditors, and prosti∣tute his public faith for a protection, may associ∣ate with sots and drunkards, sharpers and game∣sters, in order to increase his fortune; I say, it is not impossible but that a person of honour may be guilty of all these; but it is absolutely impossible for a man of honour to be guilty of any one of them.</P>

Ignorance is mere privation, by which nothing can be produced; it is a vanity in which the soul sits motionless and torped for want of attraction; and without knowing why, we always rejoice when we learn, and grieve when we forget. I am therefore inclined to conclude, that if nothing counteracts the natural consequence of learning, we grow more happy as our minds take a wider range.</P>
<P>KNOWLEDGE will soon become folly, when good sense ceases to be its guardian. The true knowledge of God and yourself, are true testimo∣nies of your being in the high road to salvation; that breeds in you a filial love, this a filial fear; the ignorance of yourself is the beginning of all sin, and the ignorance of God, is the perfection of all evil.</P>

Did we know ourselves, we would not be proud. For what is man? a weak and sickly body; a pityful and helpless creature, exposed to all the injuries of times and fortune; a mass of clay and corruption, prone to evil and so perverse and de∣praved a judgment, as to prize earth above heav∣en, temporal pleasures before endless felicities.

THERE is no passion that more excites us to every thing that is noble and generous than virtu∣ous love.</P>
<P>LOVE is not a guilty passion, a criminal desire which debases human nature; 'tis a most exalted esteem and regard, founded on reason and virtue; an affection which ennobles the mind, elevates the soul, and leads it nearer to heaven. This is the idea which that sacred name conveys—pure and unmixed with any gross conceptions; and which, thus understood, may as well subsist between two persons of the same, as of a different sex; though some will argue, that the latter is capable of a more refined softness.</P>
<P>LOVE founded on external charms, and which only seeks the gratification of the senses, will soon change its object, and be pleased with novelty: but where esteem is the basis of love, when it is founded on virtue—accompanied by all those ami∣able and endearing qualities of the head and heart and mind enlarged, surely that affection—that friendship cannot die—it can never fall, while those virtues remain on which it is built—by which it is enlarged, strengthened and supported.</P>

<P>AN affection in a lover is restless, so if it be perfect it is endless.</P>
<P>LOVE makes a man that is naturally addicted to vice to be endued with virtue, forces him to apply himself to all laudable exercises, that thereby he may obtain his love's favour, endeavours to be skilful in good letters, that by his learning he may allure her; to excel in music, that by his melody he may entice her; to frame his speech in a per∣fect phrase, that by his eloquence he may persuade her; and what nature wants, he seeks to amend by art; and the only cause of this virtuous dispo∣sition is love.</P>
<P>LOVE fixed on virtue, increaseth ever by con∣tinuance.</P>
<P>LOVE is a virtue, if measured by dutiful choice, and not maimed by wilful chance.</P>

IT is a narrowness of mind to wish to confine your friends affection solely to yourself; If she de∣pends on you alone for all the comforts and advan∣tages of friendship, your absence or death may leave her desolate and folorn.

<HEAD>LOVE OF GOD.</HEAD>
<P>THE three great springs of love to God are these; A clear discovery of what God is in himself; a lively sense of what he has done for us, and a well grounded hope of what he will do for us. Where the love of God reigns in the affections, it will command all the powers of nature, and all the rest of the passions to act suitably to this sovereign and all ruling affection of love. The eye will often look up to God in a way of humble dependence; the ear will be attentive to his holy word; the hands will be lifted up to heaven in daily requests; the knees will be bent in humble worship; all the outward powers will be buisy in doing the will of God, and promoting his glory. He that loves God will keep his commandments, and fulfil every present duty with delight: He will endeav∣our to please God in all his actions, and watch against and avoid whatever may offend him; and while the several outward powers are thus engag∣ed, all the inward affections of nature will be em∣ployed in corresponding exercises. Supreme love will govern all the active train of human pas∣sions, and lead them captive to chearful obedience,</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="028841_0131_0FDDDB29A7A27048"/>
HOW senseless and absurd is the pretence to love God above all things, if we do not resolve to live upon him as our hope and happiness; if we do not chuse him to be our God and our all, our chief and all sufficient good in this world, and that which is to come! Where the idea of God, as a Being of supreme excellence, doth not reign in the mind, where the will is not determined and fixed on him as our supreme good, men are strangers to that sa∣cred and divine affection of love. 'Till this be done, we cannot be said to love God with all our heart.</P>
<P>HOW necessary and useful a practice it is there∣fore for a christian to meditate often on the trans∣cendent perfections and worth of the blessed God, to survey his attributes, and his grace in Christ Jesus; to keep in mind a constant idea of his su∣preme excellence, and frequently to repeat and confirm the choice of him as our highest hopes, our portion and our everlasting good! This will keep the love of God warm at heart, and maintain the divine affection in its primitive life and vig∣our. But if our ideas of the adorable and supreme excellence of God grow saint and feeble, and sink lower in the mind; if we lose the sight of his ami∣able glories, the sense of his amazing love in the gospel, his rich promises, and alluring grace; if we shall abate the fervency of this sacred passion,
<PB N="132" REF="028841_0132_0FDDDB2AE9407C60"/>
our love to God grows cold by degrees, and suf∣fers great and gradual decays.</P>
<P>WHAT thanks do we owe to God, who, though we are so much indebted to him, demands only our love, to pay off all our debts upon this considera∣tion; doth he not shew us, by placing the precept of love above all others, how, poor and insolvent as we are, we may clear ourselves of all that we owe him?</P>
<P>IT is surely impossible to read the life and death of our blessed Saviour, without renewing and in∣creasing in our hearts, that love and reverence, and gratitude to him, which is so justly due for all he did and suffered for us; every word that fell from his lips is more precious than all the treasures of the earth, for his are the words of eternal life! They must therefore be laid up in our hearts, and be constantly referred to, on all occasions, as the rule and direction of all our actions.</P>
<P>IT is impossible to love God, without desiring to please him, and as far as we are able to resemble him; therefore the love of God must lead to every virtue in the highest degree; and we may be sure we do not truly love him, if we content ourselves with avoiding flagrant sins, and do not strive in good earnest, to reach the greatest degree of per∣fection we are capable of, by his help.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="028841_0133_0FDDDB2E405C1250"/>
WE cannot possibly exceed in the measure of our love to God, to whom reason as well as revelation directs us to offer the best of our affec∣tions, and from whom alone we can hope for that happiness, which it is our nature incessantly to de∣sire.</P>

If your love hath any other motive, it is false love; if your motive hath any other end, it is self love. If you neglect your love to your neighbour, in vain you profess your love to God; for by your love to God, your love to your neigh∣bour is acquired; and by your love to your neigh∣bour, your love to God is nourished.</P>

WE may hate men's vices without any ill will to their persons; but we cannot help despising those that have no kind of virtue to recommend them.</P>
<P>HE that makes any thing his chiefest good, wherein virtue, reason and humanity, do not bear a part, can never do the offices of friendship, jus∣tice, or liberality.</P>
<P>A REGARD to decency and the common punctil∣ios of life, has been often serviceable to society. It has kept many a married couple unseparated, and frequently preserves a neighbourly intercourse, wherelove and friendship have both been wanting.</P>
<P>IT is providential that our affection diminishes in proportion as our friend's power increases. Affection is of less importance, whenever a per∣son can support himself. It is on this account that younger brothers are oft beloved more than their elders; and that Benjamin is the favourite.</P>
<P>"LOVE worketh no ill to his neighbour," therefore, if we have true benevolence, we will never do any thing injurious to individuals, or to society. Those very comprehensive moral precepts our Saviour has graciously left with us, which can never fail to direct us aright, if fairly and hon∣estly applied, such as, "whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, even so do unto them." There is no occasion, great or small, on
<PB N="135" REF="028841_0135_0FDDDB33412F7398"/>

<HEAD>MARRIAGE.</HEAD>
<P>MARRIAGE is certainly a condition, upon which the happiness or misery of life does very much depend; more than indeed most people think beforehand. To be confined to live with one perpetually, for whom we have no liking and esteem, must certainly be an uneasy state. There had need be a great many good qualities to recon∣cile a constant conversation with one, where there is some share of kindness, but without love, the very best of all good qualities will never make a constant conversation easy and delightful. And whence proceed those innumerable domestic mise∣ries,
<PB N="136" REF="028841_0136_0FDDDB34B6899BE0"/>
that plague and utterly confound so many fam∣ilies, but from want of love and kindness in the wife or husband; from these come their neglect and careless management of affairs at home, and their profuse extravagant expenses abroad. In a word, it is not easy, as it is not needful, to recount the evils that arise abundantly, from the want of conjugal affection only. And since this is so cer∣tain, a man or woman runs the most fearful hazard that can be, who marries without their affection in themselves, and without good assurances of it in the other.</P>
<P>LET you love advice before you chuse, and your choice be fixed before you marry. Remember the happiness or misery of your life depends upon this one act, and that nothing but death can dis∣solve the knot.</P>
<P>A SINGLE life is doubtless preferable to a marri∣ed one, where prudence and affection do not ac∣company the choice; but where they do, there is no terrestrial happiness equal to the married state.</P>
<P>THERE cannot be too near an equality, too exact a harmony betwixt a married couple; it is a step of such weight as calls for all our foresight and penetration, and, especially the temper and education must be attended to. In unequal match∣es the men are generally more in fault than the women, who can seldom be chusers.</P>

<P>MARRIAGES founded on affection are the most happy. Love (says Addison) ought to have shot its roots deep, and to be well grown before we enter into that state. There is nothing which more nearly concerns the peace of mankind—it is his choice in this respect on which his happiness or misery for life depends.</P>
<P>THOUGH Solomon's description of a wise and good woman, may be thought too mean and me∣chanical for this refined generation; yet certain it is, that the business of a family is the most pro∣fitable and honourable study they can employ themselves in.</P>
<P>THE best dowry to advance the marriage of a young lady is, when she has in her countenance, mildness; in her speech, wisdom; in her behav∣iour, modesty; and in her life, virtue.</P>
<P>BETTER is a portion in a wife, than with a wife.</P>
<P>AN inviolable fidelity, good humour, and com∣placency of temper in a wife, cutlive all the charms of a fine face, and make the decays of it invisible.</P>

<P>A GOOD wife, says Solomon, is a good portion; and there is nothing of so much worth as a mind well instructed.</P>
<P>SWEETNESS of temper, affection to her husband and attention to his interests, constitute the duties of a wife, and form the basis of matrimonial felic∣ity. The idea of power on either side, should be totally banished. It is not sufficient, that the husband should never have occasion to regret the want of it; the wife must so behave, that he may never be conscious of possessing it.</P>

<P>TRUE merit is not afraid of being effaced by that of others. We judge of the merit of men by the usefulness of their actions, and there are a great many men valued in the world, who have no other merit than vices profitable to commerce and society. The more true merit a man has, the more does he applaud it in others. Real merit gains a man the esteem of good men, but it is only fate and chance that gains him that of the multitude.</P>

<P>MEN of mean qualities shew but little favour to great virtues, a lofty wisdom offends an ordinary reason.</P>
<P>SUPERIORITY of virtue is the most unpardona∣ble provocation that can be given to a base mind. Innocence is too amiable to be beheld without hatred; and it is a secret acknowledgment of merit which the wicked are betrayed into, when they pursue good men with violence.

<P>WE ought not to judge of men's merits by their qualifications, but by the use they make of them.</P>
<P>IT is a thing exceedingly rare to distinguish vir∣tue and fortune. The most impious, if prosperous, are always applauded; the most virtuous, if un∣prosperous, are sure to be despised.</P>
<P>OUR good qualities often expose us to more hatred and persecution, than all the ill we do.</P>

<P>THE world is a theatre, the best actors are those that represent their parts most naturally; but the wisest are seldom the heroes in the play. It is not to be considered (says Epictetus) who is prince, or who is beggar, but who acts the prince or the beggar best.</P>

<P>LEWIS the fourteenth though a king, rewarded merit and encouraged literature. Plutarch has a fine expression, with regard to some women of learning, humility and virtue—that her orna∣ments were such as might be purchased without money, and would render any woman's life glori∣ous and happy. Adam signifies earth, and Eve life. But not to insist upon Hebrew definitions, man was originally made of the dead earth—but woman of the living man—therefore, of a more excellent nature.</P>

<P>THERE is no accident so exquisitely unfortunate, but wise men will make some advantage of it; nor any so entirely fortunate, but fools may turn it to their own prejudice. One advantage gained by ca∣lamities, is to know how to sympathize with others in the like troubles. It is often found, that to be armed against calamities with a tranquil mind, is either a sure way to avoid them, or at least to pro∣tract the season of their arrival; and if there was nothing else in it, but the rendering them the more tolerable when they happen, it would be prudent to try the experiment.</P>
<P>HUMAN life is so full of lamentable events, that either for ourselves, or for our fellow creatures, we find continual subject for mourning; and thus that benevolence, which is the very essence of vir∣tue, contributes to make us wretched.</P>
<P>IN human life there is a constant change of fortune; and it is unreasonable to expect an ex∣emption from the common fate.</P>

<HEAD>MODESTY AND IMPUDENCE.</HEAD>
<P>MODESTY has a natural tendency to conceal a man's talents, as impudence displays them to the utmost, and has been the only cause why many have risen in the world, under all the disadvantages of low birth and little merit. Such indolence and incapacity is there in the generality of mankind, that they are apt to receive a man for whatever he has a mind to put himself off for, and admit his over bearing airs, as proofs of that merit which he assumes to himself.</P>
<P>A DECENT assurance seems to be the natural at∣tendant on virtue; and few men can distinguish impudence from it; as, on the other hand, diffi∣dence being the natural result of vice and folly, has drawn disgrace upon modesty, which in out∣ward appearance so nearly resembles it.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="028841_0153_0FDDDB5EA6575A78"/>
As impudence, though really a vice, has the same effect upon a man's fortune, as if it were a virtue, so we may observe, that it is almost as dif∣ficult to be obtained, and is, in that respect, distin∣guished from all the other vices which are acquir∣ed with little pains, and continually increase up∣on indulgence. Many a man being sensible that modesty is exceedingly prejudicial to him in making his fortune, has resolved to be impudent, and put a bold face upon the matter; but 'tis observ∣able, that such people have seldom succeeded in their attempts, but have been obliged to relapse into their primitive modesty. Nothing carries a man through the world, like a true, genuine, nat∣ural impudence; its counterfeit is good for no∣thing, nor can ever support itself. If any thing can give a modest man more assurance, it must be some advantages of fortune which chance procured to him. Riches naturally gain a man a favourable reception in the world, and give merit a double lustre, when a person is endowed with it. 'Tis wonderful to observe what airs of superiority fools and knaves, with large possessions, give themselves, above men of the greatest merit, in poverty. Nor do the men of merit make any strong opposition to those usurpations, but rather seem to favour them by the modesty of their behaviour.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="028841_0154_0FDDDB5EDC992AC0"/>
TO make wisdom agree with impudence, is as difficult as to reconcile vice and modesty. These are the reflexions which have occurred upon this subject of modesty and impudence, and I hope the reader will not be displeased to see them wrought into the following allegory.</P>
<P>JUPITER in the beginning joined Virtue, Wis∣dom and Confidence together; and Vice, Folly and Diffidence; and thus connected, sent them into the world. But though he thought he had matched them with great judgment, and said, that Confi∣dence was the natural companion of Virtue, and that Vice deserved to be attended with Diffidence. They had not gone far before dissension arose among them. Wisdom, who was the guide of the one company, was always accustomed, before she ventured on any road, however beaten, to exam∣ine it carefully, to enquire whither it led; what dangers, difficulties, or hindrances might possibly, or probably occur in it. In these deliberations she usually consumed some time, which delay was very displeasing to Confidence, who was always inclined to hurry on, without much forethought or deliber∣ation, in the first road he met. Wisdom and Vir∣tue were inseparable; but Confidence one day following his impetuous nature, advanced a con∣siderable way before his guides and companions, and not feeling any want of their company, he
<PB N="155" REF="028841_0155_0FDDDB61DE09C9F0"/>
never enquired after them, nor ever met with them more. In like manner, the other society, though joined by Jupiter, disagreed and separat∣ed. As Folly saw very little way before her, she had nothing to determine concerning the goodness of roads, nor could give the preference to one above another, and their want of resolution increased by Diffidence, who, with her doubts and scruples always retarded the journey. This was a great annoyance to Vice, who loved not to hear of difficulties and delays, and was never satisfied without his full career in whatever his in∣clinations led him to. Folly, he knew, though she hearkened to Diffidence, would be easily ma∣naged when alone, therefore, as a vicious horse throws its rider, he openly beat away this controller of his pleasures, and proceeded on his journey with Folly, from whom he is inseparable. Confidence and Diffidence being after this manner both thrown loose from their respective companions, wandered for some time; till at last chance led them at the same time to the same village. Confidence went directly up to the great house, which belonged to Wealth, the lord of the village, and without staying for a porter, intruded himself immediately into the innermost appartments, where he found Vice and Folly were received before him. He joined the
<PB N="156" REF="028841_0156_0FDDDB63436E24B0"/>
train, recommended himself very quickly to his landlord, and entered into such familiarity with Vice, that he was enlisted in the same company with Folly. They were frequent guests with Wealth, and from that moment inseparable. Dif∣fidence in the mean time, not daring to approach the great house, accepted of an invitation from one of the tenants, and entering the cottage found Wisdom and Virtue, who, being repulsed by the landlord, had retired thither.</P>
<P>VIRTUE took compassion on her, and Wisdom found from her temper, that she would easily im∣prove, so they admitted her into their society. Accordingly by their means, she altered, in a little time, somewhat of her manner; and becoming much more amiable and engaging, was now cal∣led by the name of Modesty.</P>
<P>AS ill company has a greater effect than good, Confidence, though more refractory to council and example, degenerated so far by the society of Vice and Folly, as to pass by the name of Impudence.</P>
<P>MANKIND, who saw these societies as Jupiter first joined them, and knew nothing of these mu∣tual dissensions, are thereby led into strange mis∣takes, and whenever they see Impudence, make ac∣count of Virtue and Wisdom; and oft when they observe Modesty, call her attendants Vice and Folly.</P>

<P>A MAN without modesty, is lost to all sense of honour and virtue.</P>
<P>MODESTY is sure the chiefest ornament of our sex, and cannot be blameable in the men; it is one of the most amiable qualities that either man or woman can possess.</P>
<P>THERE scarce can be named one quality that is amiable in a woman, which is not becoming in a man, not excepting even modesty and gentleness of nature.</P>
<P>THE modesty of women prevails more than their power, riches, or beauty. Modesty in your dis∣course, will give a lustre to truth, and an excuse to your errors.</P>
<P>IT has been said, that when Jove created the passions, he assigned every one of them its destined abode; modesty was forgotten, and when she was introduced to him, he knew not where to place her; she was therefore ordered to consort with all the rest; ever since that time she is inseparable from them; she is the friend of truth, and betrays the lie that dares attack it; she is in a strict and inti∣mate unity with love, she always attends, and fre∣quently discovers and proclaims it; love, in a

word, loses its charms, when ever it appears with∣out her. There is not a more glorious ornament for either sex, than modesty.</P>
<P>THE first of all virtues is innocence, the next is modesty. If we banish modesty out of the world, she carries away with her half the virtues that are in it.</P>
<P>MODESTY makes large amends for the pain it gives the persons who labour under it; by the prejudice it affords every worthy person in its fa∣vour.</P>
<P>AS real modesty is the beauty of the mind, so an affectation of it, as much disgraces a perfect mind, as art and an affected dress do a perfect face.</P>

<HEAD>MUSIC.</HEAD>
<P>IF we consider music merelyas an entertainment, doubtless the author of all good designed the plea∣sing harmony and melody of sounds (among other purposes) to heighten the innocent pleasures of
<PB N="159" REF="028841_0159_0FDDDB6CE788A2D0"/>
human life, and to alleviate and dispel its cares. When we are oppressed with sorrow and grief, it can enliven and exhilerate our drooping spirits. When we are elated, and as it were, intoxicated with excessive joy, (for joy may be excessive and even dangerous) it can moderate the violence of the passions, bring us down from the giddy height and reduce us to a state of tranquillity. If inflamed with anger, or boiling with rage, it can soften <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> into pity, or melt us into compassion. In a word, hatred, malice, envy, and all the hideous group of infernal passions, which are at once the tor∣ment and disgrace of humanity, flee before this powerful charmer, who, not content with this conquest, goes on if we listen to her inchanting strains, refining our passions, and cherishing those virtuous impulses, and that gentleness of man∣ners in the soul, which every one feels, who has not stifled them by sensuality, baseness, or vil∣lany; of these latter,</P>
<P>SHAKESPEARE, that sagacious piercer into hu∣man nature, writes thus:
<Q><L>The man that has not music in himself,</L>
<L>Nor is not mov'd with concord of sweet sounds,</L>
<L>Is fit for treason, villanies and spoils.</L>

<P>MUSIC is one of the seven sciences, and is justly admired by all people of a fine taste, and who love the liberal arts. A man who has no taste for mu∣sic, is destitute of a feeling, which we are inform∣ed will be of high estimation in another system. The want of a taste for music, is a sign of a barba∣rous disposition, and those who are not affected with its charms, are, in character, something be∣low the beasts of the field. A taste for this art does not imply that a person is an actual performer upon an instrument, or that he is a good singer; both judgment and taste for music, may be where the power of the organs that are necessary for execution are wanting. A person may have a bad voice, and yet be delighted with a good song, and be a good judge of singing, he may be pleased with a tune upon the violin or harpsichord, and yet not be able to perform upon either. Such as do not love music, are persons that few chuse to to keep company with.</P>

<HEAD>HUMAN NATURE.</HEAD>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the degene∣racy and meaness that is crept into human nature, there are a thousand actions in which it breaks through its original corruption, and shews what it once was, and what it will be hereafter. We may consider the soul of man, as the ruin of a glo∣rious pile of building; where, amidst the heaps of rubbish, you meet with noble fragments of sculpture, broken pillars and obelisks, and a mag∣nificence in confusion. Virtue and wisdom are continually employed in clearing the ruins, re∣moving these disorderly heaps, recovering the noble piles that lie buried under them, and adjust∣ing
<PB N="162" REF="028841_0162_0FDDDB752A5E92A8"/>
them as well as possible, according to their ancient symmetry and beauty. A happy education, conversation with the finest spirits, looking abroad into the works of nature, and observations upon mankind, are the greatest assistances to this neces∣sary and glorious work. But even among those who have never had the happiness of any of these advantages, there are sometimes such exertions of the greatness that is natural to the mind of man, as shew capacities and abilities that need only those accidental helps to fetch them out, and shew them in a proper light. A plebeian soul, is still the ruin of this glorious edifice, though encumbered with all its rubbish.</P>
<P>DISCOURSES of religion and morality, and re∣flections upon human nature are the best means we can make use of to improve our minds, and gain a true knowledge of ourselves; and conse∣quently to recover our souls out of the vice, igno∣rance and prejudice which naturally cleave to them.</P>
<P>THERE is nothing which favours and falls in with the natural greatness and dignity of human nature, so much as religion; which does not only promise the entire refinement of the mind, but the glorifying of the body, and the immortality of both.</P>

IT is with the mind as with the will and appe∣tites; for, as after we have tried a thousand pleasures, and turned from one enjoyment to another, we find no rest to our desires, till we at last fix them upon the sovereign good; so in pursuit of knowledge, we meet with no tolerable satisfaction to our minds, till after we are weary with trac∣ing other methods, we turn them upon the one supreme and unerring truth. And were there no other use of human learning, there is this in it, that by its many defects, it brings us to a sense of our weakness, and makes us readily and with greater willingness, submit to revelation.</P>
<P>IT is according to nature to be merciful, for no man that has not divested himself of humanity can be hard hearted to others, without feeling a pain in himself.</P>

They may be induced to change their honest measures and sac∣rifice their cause and friends to an imaginary in∣terest; and, after this, act farces as they think fit, and hear qualities and virtues assigned to them, under the titles of graces, excellencies and the rest of this mock praise, and mimical appellation.

If therefore destruction be not sure enough, they will do their utmost to make it so, by treading down the only bridge where they can escape it, that is, by trampling under their feet the precious blood and wounds of the Son of God, and impre∣cating the damnation of hell upon their souls, as if it slumbered too long, and was too slow paced in its motion towards them.</P>
<P>IT is common for some men to swear, only to fill up the vacuities of their empty discourse.</P>
<P>COMMON swearing argues in a man, a perpetual distrust of his own reputation, and is an acknowl∣edgment that he thinks his bare word not wor∣thy of credit.</P>

THE man of the world—the all accomplished—Earl of Chesterfield says, "I was even absurd enough, for a little while, to swear, by way of adorning and completing the shining character of the man of fashion, or pleasure, which I affected; but this folly I soon-laid aside, upon finding both the guilt, and the indecency of it. Listen ye Stanhopean pretenders, ye pretenders to politesse.</P>
<P>THE great Dr. Desagulier being invited to make one of an illustrious company, one of whom, an officer present, being unhappily addicted to swearing in his discourse, at the period of every oath, would continually ask the doctor's pardon; the doctor bore this levity for some time with pa∣tience; at length he was necessitated to silence the swearer with this fine rebuke: "Sir, you have taken some pains to render me ridiculous (if possi∣ble) by your pointed apologies; now Sir, I am to tell you, <HI>If God Almighty does not hear you, I assure you I will never tell him.</HI>"</P>

<HEAD>OPPRESSION.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a species of oppression that custom (and a bad custom it is) has made too familiar to the inhabitants of this isle, that is, the confinement of the person of their fellow creatures, for debt, &amp;c. under sanction of the law; indeed law is necessary for the protection of our property, and there are men of strict honour, probity, and humanity in that profession, who do honour to it; but these are not the men who advise arrests, imprisonments and destruction, that would lay waste a whole fam∣ily, merely to put money in his purse; such only are the proceedings of the dregs of that profession.</P>
<P>THE sentiments of humanity incline us to com∣fort the miserable, and it is a failing in the most es∣sential duties, to abandon them in their present oc∣casions; but it is almost excess of cruelty to insult
<PB N="177" REF="028841_0177_0FDDDB9F45248F10"/>
them in their misfortunes. A man under any mis∣fortune is to be pitied: If you have not the gene∣rosity to lend him your hand to retrieve him, do not add a new weight to his disgrace to sink him utterly. And yet men are so brutal and unmerci∣ful, as to load a man with the most severe censure, who is unfortunate. The first thought that occurs is, to dive into the reason of his distress. They neither offer in his behalf the misfortune of the times, nor the posture of affairs and conjuncture of things, but will absolutely have him guilty of mer∣iting all that has befallen him, and invent a thou∣sand malicious stories to discredit and ruin him beyond recovery. Detestable practice! Can such persons call themselves men? No! their actions are too evident a proof of the brutal, instead of the rational mind. The wounded porpoise is pur∣sued to absolute destruction by his fellow fish, and the stricken deer is denied shelter by his most cus∣tomary associates; but surely such practices must forfeit all title to humanity.</P>
<P>HOW justly does Mr. Somerville, in his chace, compare such persons to a pack of hounds worry∣ing one of their wounded species to death.</P>

<HEAD>POLITENESS.</HEAD>
<P>POLITENESS taught as an art is ridicu∣lous; as the expression of liberal sentiment and courteous manners, it is truly valuable.</P>
<P>POLITENESS is an evenness of soul, which ex∣cludes at the same time both insensibility and too much earnestness. It supposes a quick discern∣ment, to perceive immediately the different char∣acters of men: And by an easy condescension, adapts itself to each man's taste; not to flatter, but to calm his passions. In a word, it is a forget∣ting of ourselves, in order to seek whatever may be agreeable in others: But in so delicate a manner, as to let them scarce perceive we are so employed: It knows how to contradict with respect, and please without adulation; and is equally remote from an insipid complaisance, and a mean familiarity.</P>
<LG>
<L>Study with care politeness, that must teach</L>
<L>The modish forms of gesture and of speech:</L>
<L><PB N="180" REF="028841_0180_0FDDDBA46586DF60"/>
In vain, formality, with matron mien,</L>
<L>And pertness apes her, with familiar grin;</L>
<L>They against nature for applauses strain,</L>
<L>Distort themselves, and give all others pain.</L>
<L>She moves with easy, though with measured pace,</L>
<L>And shews no part of study, but the grace.</L>
<L>Yet e'en by this man is but half refin'd,</L>
<L>Unless philosophy subdues his mind:</L>
<L>'Tis but a varnish that is quickly lost,</L>
<L>When e'er the soul in passion's sea is tost.</L>
</LG>
<P>THERE is a politeness of the heart which is con∣fined to no rank, and dependant upon no educa∣tion; the desire of obliging seldom fails, (if joined with delicacy of sentiment to please) though the stile may differ from that of modern refinement.</P>
<P>TRUE politeness is a science not to be acquired in schools. Nature must bestow a genius; and that genius must be improved by reading authors of delicacy and spirit; and heightened by a free∣dom of conversation with persons of taste. It is an enemy to all kind of constraint, does every thing with ease, and though certain never to offend, is never at the expense of flattery to oblige.</P>
<P>BE careful to observe the distinction between over strained complaisance and true politeness—between false delicacy and true.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="028841_0181_0FDDDBA849747C88"/>
HE that is truly polite, knows how to contra∣dict with respect, and to please without adula∣tion; and is equally remote from an insipid com∣plaisance, and a low familiarity.</P>
<P>MERIT and good breeding will make their way every where. Knowledge will introduce you, and good breeding will endear you to the best of companies; for, politeness and good breeding are absolutely necessary to adorn any, or all other good qualities or talents. Without them no knowledge, no perfection whatever, is seen in its best light. The scholar, without good breeding, is a pedant; the philosopher a cynic; the soldier a brute; and every one disagreeable. If a man accosts you, and talks to you ever so dully or frivolously, it is worse than rudeness, it is brutality, to shew him, by a manifest inattention to what he says, that you think him a fool, or a blockhead, and not worth hear∣ing. It is much more so with regard to women, who, of whatever rank they are, are intitled, in consideration of their sex, not only to an attention, but an officious good breeding from men. The most familiar habitudes, connexions, and friend∣ships, require a degree of good breeding else their intimacy will soon degenerate into a coarse fami∣liarity, infallibly productive of contempt or dis∣gust.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="028841_0182_0FDDDBA9A71C92C0"/>
POLITENESS and modesty are becoming in all men, but especially in those whom fortune has raised above others.</P>
<P>GOOD breeding is the result of much good sense, some good nature, and a little self denial for the sake of others, and with a view to obtain the same indulgence from them. Good manners are, to particular societies, what good morals are to so∣ciety in general, their cement and their security.</P>
<P>WORLDLY politeness is no more than an imita∣tion, or imperfect copy of Christian charity, being the pretence or outward appearance of that defe∣rance to the judgment, and attention to the inter∣ests of others; which a true Christian has as the rule of his life, and the disposition of his heart.</P>
<P>WHATEVER sphere a man has been bred in, or attained to, religion is not an injury, but an addi∣tion to the politeness of his carriage. They seem indeed to confess their relation to one another, by their reciprocal influence. In promiscuous con∣versation, as true religion contributes to make men decent or courteous, so true politeness guards them effectually from any out rage against piety or purity.</P>
<P>TO be perfectly polite, one must have a great presence of mind, with a delicate and quick sense of propriety, or, in other words, one should be
<PB N="183" REF="028841_0183_0FDDDBAD736CA088"/>
able to form an instantaneous judgment of what is fittest to be done, on every occasion as it offers. I have known one or two persons, who seemed to owe this advantage to nature only, and to have the peculiar happiness of being born, as it were, with another sense, by which they had an immediate perception of what was proper and improper, in cases absolutely new to them; but this is the lot of very few. It must every where be good breeding, to set your companions in an advantageous point of light, by giving each an opportunity of displaying their most agreeable talents, and by carefully avoid∣ing all ocoasions of exposing their defects;—to exert your own endeavours to please, and to amuse, but not to outshine them:—To give each their due share of attention and notice:—Not engrossing the talk, when others are desirous to speak, nor suffer∣ing the conversation to flag, for want of introduc∣ing something to continue or renew the subject. In honour preferring one another. We should be perfectly easy, and make others so if we can. But this happy case belongs perhaps to the last stage of perfection in politeness—but a real desire of oblig∣ing and a respectful attention, will in a great mea∣sure supply many defects.</P>

<HEAD>POVERTY.</HEAD>
<P>IN seeking virtue, if you find poverty, be not ashamed, the fault is not yours. Your honour or dishonour is purchased by your own actions; though virtue gives a ragged livery, she gives a golden cognizance. If her service make you poor, blush not; your poverty may prove disadvanta∣geous to you, but cannot dishonour you.</P>
<P>TO feel the extremity of want, and be always under discipline and mortification, must be very uncomfortable: But then we are to consider, that the world will either mend or wear off, and that the discharge will come shortly, and the hardship turn to advantage; that the contest is commend∣able and brave, and that 'tis dangerous and disho∣nourable to surrender.</P>
<LG>
<PB N="185" REF="028841_0185_0FDDDBB196CCC6D8"/>
<L>Some ancient sages did those thoughts possess;</L>
<L>That poverty's the souce of happiness.</L>
<L>Modern opinion holds, that wealth in store</L>
<L>Is the soul source, can happiness insure,</L>
<L>But heav'n born wisdom teaches better things;</L>
<L>Not to expect from these, what virtue only brings.</L>
</LG>
<P>POVERTY falls heavy upon him only, who es∣teems it a misfortune.</P>
<P>IT is more honourable not to have and yet de∣serve, than to have and not deserve.</P>
<P>THE little value Providence sets upon riches, is seen by the persons on whom it is bestowed. Though want is the scorn of every wealthy fool, an innocent poverty is yet preferable to all the guilty affluence the world can offer.</P>
<P>THERE is no contending with necessity; and we should be very tender how we censure those that submit to it. It is one thing to be at liberty to do as we will, and another thing to be tied up to do what we must.</P>
<P>OF all poverty, that of the mind is the most de∣plorable.</P>
<P>IT is in every body's observation with what dis∣advantage a poor man enters upon the most ordi∣nary business; for as certainly as wealth gives
<PB N="186" REF="028841_0186_0FDDDBB2E8CA94C8"/>
grace and acceptance to all that its possessor says or does, so poverty creates disesteem, scorn and pre∣judice to all the undertakings of the indigent. The necessitous man has neither hands, lips, nor un∣derstanding for his own, or his friends use; but is in the same condition with the sick, with this dif∣ference only, that his is an infection no man will relieve, or assist; or if he does, 'tis seldom with as much pity as contempt, and rather for the ostenta∣tion of the physician, than compassion on the pa∣tient: It is a circumstance, wherein a man finds all the good he deserves inaccessible, all the ill una∣voidable; under these pressures, the poor man speaks with hesitation, undertakes with irresolu∣tion, and acts with disappointment; he is slighted in men's conversations, overlooked in their assem∣blies, &amp;c. But from whence, alas! has he this treatment? From a creature that has only the sup∣port of, but not an exemption from the wants, for which he despises him; for such is the unaccount∣able insolence of man, he will not see, that he who is supported, is in the same class of natural neces∣sity, as he that wants a support; and to be helped implies to be indigent.</P>
<P>A MAN is not judged by the internal qualifications of his mind, but by the extent of his house. One who has been in business, and has not gained riches, is said to have done poorly, notwithstanding his
<PB N="187" REF="028841_0187_0FDDDBB5D8EF8F68"/>
mind may be formed by the best of principles, and his actions guided by the highest rules of Christian benevolence; which perhaps was the only cause of his not thriving in temporary wealth in an equal degree with some of his cotemporaries. While some who live as "without God in the world," thoughtless of every concern but accumu∣lating wealth, are esteemed of the first rank in the community, and the most able members of socie∣ty. So much is the truth of that saying verified, that "Money commands all things."</P>
<P>AMIDST the miseries to which human life is liable, nothing is so generally dreaded as poverty; since it exposes mankind to distresses that are but little pitied, and to the contempt of those who have no natural endowments superior to our own. Every other difficulty or danger, a man is enabled to encounter with courage and alacrity, because he knows that his success will meet with applause, for bravery will always find its admirers; but in poverty every virtue is obscured, and no conduct can entirely secure a man from reproach. Cheer∣fulness, (as an admirable author observes) if here insensibility, and dejection, sullenness; its hard∣ships are without honour, and labours without reward. Notwithstanding this, there is no station more favourable to the growth of virtue, where the seeds of it are previously sown in the mind.
<PB N="188" REF="028841_0188_0FDDDBB8A614FA48"/>
But when poverty is felt in the utmost extreme, it then becomes excessively dangerous, and some deviations from rectitude, are perhaps impossible to be avoided.</P>
<P>VICE is covered by wealth, and virtue by pov∣erty.</P>
<P>HOW many abject souls there are, who esteem the want of wealth as a want of virtue?</P>
<P>A CONSCIOUSNESS of the rectitude of our inten∣tions, tell us, though we are unfortunate, it is not because me are more undeserving than others; nor is our native pride depressed by a sense of our poverty. We can see in idea Cencinnatus, the great dictator, preparing on his hearth the homely re∣past, with those hands that had subdued the en∣emies of this country, and borne the triumphal laurel; reflect that Socrates, the reformer, and Memnius Agrippa, the arbiter of his country, had been, the one maintained, and the other buried by contribution. And the great Scipio Africanus had been so poor, that the portions of his daughters were paid by the public: Who then would repine at adoption into a family that has been honoured by such illustrious ancestors.</P>

<HEAD>PRAISE.</HEAD>
<P>PRAISE is the tribute due to virtuous deeds, and though it is heartily to be despised, when it comes from the lips of bad men, when we have not a true title to it; yet it is not to be esteemed dis∣agreeable, or undiscreditable when bestowed upon occasions where it is really due, and by those who are really judges of virtue. Praise is the reward of noble actions: What is more animating to our commanders both by sea and land, than the assur∣ance of their country's applause, for their heroic behaviour. Praise is only to be given when truly merited, and then not in the presence of the party to whom it is due. When Telemachus repaired to the assembly of the confederate kings, after the death of Adrastus, and the Daunians desired peace, we are told, that as soon as they espied him, they
<PB N="190" REF="028841_0190_0FDDDBBD29047918"/>
were all hushed in expectation to hear him dis∣course; this made him blush, and he could not be prevailed upon to speak. The praises that were given him by public acclamations, on account of his late action, added to his bashfulness so, that he would gladly have hid himself. At length, he de∣sired as a favour, that they would desist from com∣mending him: Not but that I am a lover of praise, said he, especialy when it comes from such good judges of virtue; but, I am afraid of loving it too much. Praises are apt to corrupt men; they fill them full of themselves, and render them vain and presumptuous; we ought equally to merit and decline them; there is a great likeness between the justest and the falsest praises. Just praises are such as you will give me in my absence, if I am so happy as to deserve them. If you believe me to be really good, you ought also to believe that I am willing to be modest, and would fear vanity; spare me, therefore, if you have any esteem for me, and do not praise me as if I were a man fond of such things. A man ought to blush, when he is praised for per∣fections he does not possess. Be careful how you receive praise; from good men neither avoid it nor glory in it; from bad men neither desire nor ex∣pect it. To be praised of them that are evil, or for that which is evil, is equal dishonour; he is
<PB N="191" REF="028841_0191_0FDDDBC0D1313308"/>
happy in his merit, who is praised by the good, and emulated by the bad.</P>
<LG>
<L>Of folly, vice, disease, men proud we see,</L>
<L>And (stranger still) of blockheads flattery;</L>
<L>Whose praise defames; as if a fool should mean,</L>
<L>By spitting on your face to make it clean.</L>
</LG>
<P>THEY who deserve least praise themselves, al∣ways allow it least to others; for the poor in merit, like all other poor, envy those of superior worth, and would willingly bring them down to their own level.</P>
<P>THE understanding is by nothing more easily vanquished than the artillery of praise, especially if accompanied with the ideas of truth and gravi∣ty: It makes its way to the heart, without oppo∣sition; and the sense and dignity of the spea<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> conspire with our natural love of it, to give it the sanction of sincerity.</P>
<P>NONE are worthy to give true praise, but such as are themselves praise worthy.</P>
<P>PRAISE from the common people is generally false, and rather follows vain persons than virtuous.</P>
<P>LET us constantly follow reason, says Mon∣taigne, and let the public approbation follow us the same way, if it pleases.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="028841_0192_0FDDDBC1B2B56E18"/>
How satirical is that praise which commends a man for virtues, that all the world knows he has not.</P>
<P>THERE is this good in commendation, that it helps to confirm us in the practice of virtue.</P>
<P>THE character of the person who commends you is to be considered, before you set a value on his esteem.</P>
<P>THE praises of a worthy person, of whose good sense, penetration and understanding we have an exalted opinion, is certainly—though pleasing to the sense, a most dangerous thing; it is not in for∣titude to resist it, it surely makes us vain—unless we catch—and check its rising progress.</P>

<HEAD>PRAYER.</HEAD>
<P>PRAYER unaccompained with a servant love of God, is like a lamp unlighted; the words of the one without love being as unprofitable, as the oil and cotton of the other without flame. "Our wants" says the late Bishop of London (Dr. Gib∣son) "are daily, and the temptations which draw our hearts from God, to the things of this world are daily, and upon both these accounts our pray∣ers ought also to be daily,"</P>
<P>THE said doctor gives the following advice;</P>
<P>"OUR morning prayers will always most prop∣erly begin with thanksgivings to Almighty God, our Creator and Preserver. In the next place a sol∣emn dedication of ourselves to his service. This followed by petitions, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> for his grace and assist∣ance to ourselves—for the like in behalf of others.
<PB N="194" REF="028841_0194_0FDDDBC6E5737E70"/>
The evening prayers to begin in the same order, only a confession of sins at the end of the day, and petition must stand in the place of morning dedica∣tion—and the conclusion should be with a petition for rest and protection instead of that for a blessing on our business.—For the Sabbath, the great day of rest, &amp;c." Let your prayers be ever so proper in the form and expression, or let your heart ac∣company them with a devotion ever so intense, still be very careful to avoid the dangerous error of imagining that any merit arises from the most perfect performance of them. They become accep∣table to God through Christ alone; and are the means, indeed, to make you good; but the good∣ness itself is not in them, no more than a favour among men can be said to be deserved, because asked with humility, propriety and elegance. If therefore you were to trust merely in them, 'twould be making idols of your prayers;—it would be putting them in the place of CHRIST'S atonement, which is quite contrary to praying, (as an unwor∣thy sinner) in the name of CHRIST.</P>
<P>IF we have not recourse to God with the mind and thoughts that we ought, it looks as if we ex∣pected nothing from him; or rather, (seeing our remissness and indolence) it may be said, that we do not deserve to obtain—that we do not value the
<PB N="195" REF="028841_0195_0FDDDBCAADC5D1B8"/>
things that we seem to ask. Yet, God would have what is asked of him, asked with earnestness; and far from taking our importunity ill, he is in some manner well pleased with it. For, in fine, He is the only debtor who thinks himself obliged for the demands that are made upon him. He is the only one that pays what we never lent him. The more he sees us press him, the more liberal he is. He even gives that he does not owe. If we coldly ask, he defers his liberalities; not because he does not love to give, but because he would be pressed, and because violence is agreeable to him.</P>
<P>TERTULLIAN says something like this, of the prayers that the primitive christians made in com∣mon. We meet together, says he, as if we con∣spired to take by our prayers what we ask of him; this violence is pleasing to him. St. Paul ingeni∣ously explains what Christ teaches in the Gospel, that heaven is taken by violence; "do violence to God," says he, seize the kingdom of heaven. He that forbids us to touch another's goods, rejoices to have his own invaded: He that condemns the violence of avarice, praises that of faith.</P>
<P>As the bones of the human frame connected to∣gether, form the skeleton of a man, so repentance, faith, hope, charity, love, zeal, humility, patience, resignation, hatred of sin, purity of heart, and ho∣liness
<PB N="196" REF="028841_0196_0FDDDBCE9113D768"/>
of life, all united together make a christian; but must be accompanied with prayer, the breath of the new creature, or they will prove like dead corps, lifeless and inactive.</P>
<P>GOING to prayer with bad affections, is like paying one's levee in an undress.</P>
<P>ALL prayer must be made with faith and hope: He who would pray with effect, must live with care and piety: Our prayers must be fervent, in∣tense, earnest and importunate. Our desires must be lasting, and our prayers frequent and continu∣al. God hears us not the sooner for our many words, but much the sooner for our earnest desire. A long prayer and a short differ not in their ca∣pacities of being accepted; for both of them take their value, according to the fervency of spirit, and the charity of the prayer. That prayer which is short, by reason of an impatient spirit, dullness, slight of holy things, or indifferency of desires, is very often criminal, always imperfect; and that prayer which is long out of ostentation, supersti∣tion, or a trifling spirit, is as criminal and imper∣fect, as the other in their several instances.</P>
<P>WE must be careful in all our prayers to at∣tend our present work, having a present mind, not wandering upon impertinent things, nor distant from our words, much less contrary to them.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="028841_0197_0FDDDBD1A57D2330"/>
OFTEN pray, and you shall pray oftner; and when you are accustomed to frequent devotion, it will so insensibly unite to your nature and affec∣tions, that it will become a trouble to you to omit your usual or appointed prayers; and what you obtain at first by doing violence to your inclina∣tions, at last will be left with as much uneasiness, as that by which at first it entered.</P>

<P>THE pleasure of virtue, of charity and of learn∣ing, is true and lasting pleasure.</P>
<P>THE man whose heart is replete with pure and unaffected piety, who looks upon the father of nature in that just and amiable light, which all his works reflect upon him, cannot fail of tasting the sublimest pleasure, in contemplating the stupendu∣ous and innumerable effects of infinite goodness. Whether he looks abroad on the natural or the
<PB N="199" REF="028841_0199_0FDDDBD625962970"/>
moral world, his reflections must still be attended with delight; and the sense of his own unworthi∣ness, so far from lessening, will increase his plea∣sure, while it places the forbearing kindness and indulgence of his creator in a still more interesting point of view. Here his mind may dwell upon the present, look back to the past, or stretch forward into futurity with equal satisfaction; and, the more he indulges contemplation, the higher will his delight arise. Such a disposition as this, seems to be the most secure foundation on which the fa∣bric of pleasure can be built.</P>
<P>THE contemplation of the beauties of the uni∣verse, the cordial enjoyments of friendship, the tender delights of love, and the rational pleasures of religion, are open to all; and they are, all of them, capable of giving that real happiness con∣tended for. These being the only fountains from which true pleasure springs, it is no wonder that many should be impelled to say, they have not yet found it, and should still cry out, "Who will shew us any good." They seek it in every way but the true way. They want a heart for devotion, hu∣manity, friendship and love, and a taste for what∣ever is truly beautiful and admirable.</P>

<HEAD>PRIDE.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY man, however little, makes a figure in his own eyes.</P>
<P>PRIDE by a great mistake, is commonly taken for a greatness of soul, as if the soul was to be ennobled by vice: For that pride is one of the most enormous of vices, I think no reasonable man can dispute; it is the base offspring of weak∣ness, imperfection, and ignorance; since, were we not weak and imperfect creatures, we should not be destitute of knowledge of ourselves; and had we that knowledge, it were impossible we should be proud. But, on the contrary, true humility is a certain mark of a bright reason, and elevated soul, as being the natural consequences of them. When we come to have our minds cleared by reason from those thick mists that our disorderly
<PB N="201" REF="028841_0201_0FDD1DD0A62B5108"/>
passions throw about them; when we come to discern more perfectly, and consider more nearly the immense power and goodness, the infinite glory and duration of God; and to make a com∣parison between these perfections of his, and our own frailty and weakness and the shortness and uncertainty of our beings, we should humble our∣selves even into the very dust before him.—Titles, riches, and fine houses, signify no more to the making of one man better than another, than the finer saddle to the making of the better horse. And it truly shews a poor spirit, for one man to take these paltry advantages of another; it must be in∣trinsic worth in any creature, that must give it the preference to another. If he is ambitious to excel his fellows, let it be in something that be∣longs to himself, something that demonstrates him to be a better creature. Let him contend in vir∣tue, which alone is capable to put a great diffe∣rence between man and man; and whoever gains the advantage there, has reason to value it, though it will never make him proud.</P>

<P>THE man of shew is vain; the reserved man is proud more properly. The one has greater depth, the other a more lively imagination. Persons of proud yet abject spirits, will despise you for those distresses, for which the generous mind will pity, and endeavour to befriend you; a hint to whom only you should disclose, and from whom you should conceal them.</P>

<HEAD>READING.</HEAD>
<P>READING is to the mind what exercise is to the body, as by one, health is preserved, strenghened and invigorated; by the other, virtue, (which is the health of the mind) is kept alive, cherished and confirmed. There are persons who seldom take a book in their hand, but to discover the faults it may in their opinion contain; and merit of the work is the least of their considera∣tion; they can pass over many sine sentiments, and rhetorical expressions, without the least regard, but to whatever they think obscure, absurd, or imper∣tinent, they are sure to afford no quarter: Many perfections cannot atone for a few imperfections with them, they must have a perfect piece or none; such persons ought not to read at all, they are not fit to judge of what they do read. For
<PB N="205" REF="028841_0205_0FDDDBDA69D025B8"/>
everyman of sense and candour, who reads in order to reap the benefit of reading, will give merit its due, wherever he finds it, and be cautious how he commends. When I meet with a great many beauties in a piece, I am not offended with a few faults, which might have escaped the author through inadvertency, or which the impotence of human nature could not so well provide against. Sometimes too, what is very clear in a book, seems to us obscure, for want of reading it with sufficient attention.</P>
<P>WE should not read a book on purpose to find its faults; but, purely to understand it.</P>
<LG>
<L>Whoever thinks a faultless piece to see,</L>
<L>Thinks what ne'er was, nor is, nor e'er shall be;</L>
<L>In every work regard the writer's end,</L>
<L>Since none can compass more than they intend.</L>
</LG>
<P>OF all the diversions of life, there is none so proper to fill up its empty spaces, as the reading of useful and entertaining authors; and with that the conversation of a well chosen friend.</P>
<P>BY reading we enjoy the dead, by conversation the living, and by contemplation ourselves. Read∣ing enriches the memory, conversation polishes the wit, and contemplation improves the judg∣ment.
<PB N="206" REF="028841_0206_0FDDDBDDD40722E0"/>
Of these reading is the most important, which furnishes both the other.</P>
<P>IT must be allowed, that slow reading is the quickest and surest way to knowledge. A frequent perusal of a few well chosen books, will tend more to the improvement of the understanding, than a multifarious reading of all the superficial writers, who have attempted to acquire literary fame.</P>
<P>IF we would perpetuate our same or reputation, we must do things worth writing, or write things worth reading.</P>
<P>I THINK a person may as well be asleep—for they can be only said to dream—who read any thing, but with a view of improving their morals, or re∣gulating their conduct. Nothing in this life, after health and virtue, is more estimable than know∣ledge—nor is there any thing so easily attained, or so cheaply purchased—the labour only sitting still, and the expence but time, which if we do not spend we cannot save.—In the world, you are subject to every fool's humour.—In a library you can make every wit subject to yours.</P>

WERE the BIBLE but considered impartially and attentively, in its most advantageous lights; as it contains all the written revelation of God's will now extant; as it is the basis of our national relig∣ion, and gives vigour and spirit to all our social laws: as it is the most ancient, and consequently curious collection of historical incidents, moral precepts, and political institutions; as the style of it is, in some places, nobly sublime and poetical, and in others, sweetly natural, plain, and unaffect∣ed. In a word, as being well acquainted with it is highly requisite, in order to make men useful and ornamental in this life, (to say nothing of their happiness in the next.) It is to be hoped that a cool reflection or two of this sort, might induce the more ingenious and rational among them, to let the BIBLE take its turn, their riper years, among those volumes which pass through their hands, either for amusement or instruction. Should such an entertainment once become fashionable, of what mighty service would it be to the interest of religion, and consequently to the happiness of mankind.</P>

<HEAD>RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>RELIGION is a thing much talked of but little understood; much pretended to, but very little practised; and the reason why it is so ill practised, is, because it is so little understood; knowledge, therefore, must precede religion, since it is neces∣sary to be wise, in order to be virtuous, it must be known to whom, and upon what account duty is owing, otherwise it never an be rightly paid. It must therefore be considered, that God is the object of all religion, and that the soul is the sub∣ject wherein it exists and resides. From the soul it must proceed, and to God it must be directed, as to that Almighty Being whose power alone could create a rational soul, and whose goodness only could move him to make it capable of an eter∣nal felicity, which infinite bounty of God has
<PB N="209" REF="028841_0209_0FDDDBE366F655B0"/>
laid a perpetual obligation upon the soul to a con∣stant love, obedience and adoration of him. And to an undoubted assurance, that the same power and goodness that created man, will for ever pre∣serve him and protect him, if he perseveres in the sincere performance of his duty. The body can have no other share in religion, than by its gestures to represent and discover the bent and inclination of the mind, which representations also are but too often false and treacherous, deluding those that be∣hold them, into the opinion of a saint, but truly discovering a notorious hypocrite to God, who fees how distant his intentions are from his preten∣ces. People are as much deceived themselves, as they deceive others, who think to use religion as they do their best clothes, only wear it to church and on sundays, to appear fine, and make a shew, and with them, as soon as they come home again, lay it aside carefully, for fear of wearing it out: That religion is good for nothing that is made of so slight a stuff, as will not endure wearing, which ought to be as constant a covering for the soul, as the skin is to the body, not to be divided from it; division being the ruin of both. Nor must it be thought that religion consists only in bending the knees, which is a sitting posture of humility; but in the servent and humble adoration of the soul
<PB N="210" REF="028841_0210_0FDDDBE68FBF1120"/>
Nor in the lifting up of the hands and eyes, but in the wormth of the affection. Outward gestures and decent behaviour are things very sit and rea∣sonable, being all that the body can pay; but it is inward sincerity alone that can render them both acceptable. Much less does religion consist in dismal looks and sour faces, which only shews that it is very unpalatable to those who make them; and it seems as if they were swallowing of something that went grievously against their stomachs. 'Tis likewise to be considered, the frequency and fer∣vency of prayers gives it acceptance, not the length of them. That one prayer rightly addressed to God from a well disposed mind, is more effica∣cious than ten sermons carelessly heard, and more carelessly practised. But hearing being a much easier duty then praying, because it can often change into sleeping, is therefore preferred to it, by a great many people. But if, in the end, their profound ignorance will not excuse them, I am sure their stupid obstinacy never will. But there are so many virtues required in order to praying rightly, that people think, perhaps, that it would take up too much time and pains to acquire them. And they are much in the right, if they think their prayers will be insignificant without them, and that an ill man can never pray well, and to purpose, for the
<PB N="211" REF="028841_0211_0FDDDBE7F43DFE30"/>
stream will always partake of the fountain. And if the mind, which is the fountain of all our addres∣ses to God, be vitious and impure, the prayers which proceed from it, must needs be sullied with the same polutions. But, on the contrary if the mind be once made virtuous, all that proceeds from it will be pleasing and accepted. And as to dejected looks and a sorrowful countenance, they are no wise graceful in religion, which is so far from being a melancholy thing, that it can never appear displeasing, or tiresome to a mind where wisdom and virtue do not first seem troublesome; for wisdom instructing the soul to act reasonably, instructs it likewise to serve and obey God readily and chearfully; for that which appears reasonable to a wise man, will always appear delightful; and religion is that very same reason and wisdom, whose ways are ways of pleasantness, and all whose paths are peace.</P>
<P>WERE men sensible of the happiness that re∣sults from true religion, the voluptuous man would there seek his pleasure, the covetous man his wealth, and the ambitous man his glory.</P>
<P>MEN who are destitute of religion are so far from being learned philosophers, that they ought not to be esteemed so much as reasonable men.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="028841_0212_0FDDDBE966E0D9B0"/>
RELIGION is so far from debarring men of any innocent pleasure or comfort of human life, that it purifies the pleasures of it, and renders them more grateful and generous. And besides this, it brings mighty pleasures of its own, those of a glorious hope, a serene mind, a calm and undisturbed con∣science, which do far outrelish the most studied and artificial luxuries.</P>
<P>NEITHER human wisdom, nor human virtue—unsupported by religion, are equal to the trying situations that often occur in life.</P>
<P>AS little appearance as there is of religion in the world, there is a great deal of its influence felt in its affairs—nor can any who have been religiously educated, so root out the principles of it, but like nature, they will return again, and give checks and interruptions to guilty pursuits.—There can be no real happiness without religion and virtue, and the assistance of God's grace and Holy Spirit to direct our lives, in the true pursuit of it. Happiness, I contend is only to be found in religion—in the consciousness of virtue—and a sure and certain hope of a better life, which brightens all our pros∣pects, and leaves no room to dread disappointments,—because the expectations of it are built upon a rock, whose foundations are as deep as those of heaven or hell.—So strange and unaccountable
<PB N="213" REF="028841_0213_0FDDDBED0DC41028"/>
a creature is man! he is so framed, that he can∣not but pursue happiness—and yet, unless he is made sometimes miserable, how apt is he to mis∣take the way, which can only lead him to the ac∣complishments of all his wishes.—What pity it is that the sacred name of religion should ever have been borrowed and employed in so bad a work, as in covering over pride—spiritual pride, the worst of all pride—hypocrisy, self love, covetous∣ness, extortion, cruelty and revenge—or that the fair form of virtue should have been thus disguis∣ed, and forever drawn into suspicion, from the un∣worthy uses of this kind, to which the artful and abandoned have often put her.—Some people pass through life, soberly and religiously enough, with∣out knowing why, or reasoning about it—but from force of habit merely.—Again, some think it suf∣ficient to be good Christians, without being good men—To spend their lives in—drinking, cheating—and praying.</P>
<P>TRUE religion gives an habitual sweetness and complacency, which produces genuine politeness, without injury to sincerity; it preserves the mind from every unfair bias, and inclines it to temper justice with mercy in all its judgments upon others.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="028841_0214_0FDDDBEDF190A4F8"/>
RELIGION is the best armour in the world, but the worst cloak.</P>
<P>DIVINE meditations do not only in power sub∣due all sensual pleasures, but far exceed them in sweetness and delight.</P>
<P>To be furious in religion is to be irreligiously religious. Persecution can be no argument to persuade, nor violence the way to conversion.</P>
<P>WERE angels, if they look into the ways of men, to give in their catalogue of worthies, how differ∣ent would it be from that which any of our own species would draw up? We are dazzled with the splendor of titles, the oftentation of learning, and the noise of victories, &amp;c. They, on the contrary, see the philosopher in the cottage, who possesses a soul in thankfulness, under the presure of what little minds call poverty and distress. The even∣ing's walk of a wise man is more illustrious in their sight, than the march of a general, at the head of a hundred thousand men. A contemplation of God's works, a generous concern for the good of mankind, and unfeigned exercise of humility only—denominates men great and glorious.</P>
<P>WHAT can be more suitable to a rational crea∣ture, than to employ reason to contemplate that divine Being, which is both the author of its reason,
<PB N="215" REF="028841_0215_0FDDDBF180B3A830"/>
and noblest object about which it can possibly be employed.</P>
<P>ALL our wisdom and happiness consists summa∣rily in the knowledge of God and ourselves. To know, and to do, is the compendium of our duty.</P>
<P>WE have a great work on our hands, the gospel promises to believe, the commands to obey, temp∣tations to resist, passions to conquer; and this must be done, or we are undone; therefore look to heaven for the power.</P>
<P>RELIGION is exalted reason, refined from the grosser parts of it. It is both the foundation and crown of all virtues. It is morality raised and im∣proved to its height, by being carried nearer to heaven, the only place where perfection resideth.</P>
<P>THE greatest wisdom is, to keep our eye per∣petually on a future judgment, for the direction and government of our lives; which will furnish us with such principles of action, as cannot be so well learned elsewhere.</P>
<P>HOW miserable is that man, that cannot look backward without shame, nor forward without terror! What comfort will his riches afford him in his extremity; or what will all his sensual pleasures, his vain and empty titles, robes, digni∣ties and crowns avail him in the day of his distress.</P>

<HEAD>REPENTANCE.</HEAD>
<P>TRUE repentance is that saving grace wrought in the soul, by the spirit of God, whereby a sinner is made to see, and be sensible of his sin, is grieved and humbled before God on account of it, not so much for the punishment to which sin has made him liable, as that thereby God is dishonoured and offended; his laws violated, and their own soul polluted and defiled: And this grief arises from love to God, and is accompanied with a hatred of sin, a fixed resolution to forsake it, and expectation of favour and forgiveness through the merits of CHRIST; this is evangelical repentance. The
<PB N="217" REF="028841_0217_0FDDDBF6AF414270"/>
insensibility of a sinner, the want of regret and penitence, after having finned provokes God more than the sin itself.</P>
<P>WHEN God is angry with us, it is not through a principle of hatred, that he shews his anger, it is to draw us to him, even in the time of his anger. Salvian gives the following ingenious description of repenting sinners, who, far from conversion are always relapsing into sin.</P>
<P>THEY act every thing in such a manner, that one may say, they do not so much repent of their sins, as they afterwards do of that repentance. They seem by their behaviour, not to be so sorry for their ill life, as that they have promised to live a good one.—How terrible is conviction and guilt, when they come too late for repentance.</P>

<P>THE time present is the only time we have to repent in, to serve God, to do good to men, to improve our knowledge, to exercise our graces, and to prepare for a blessed immortality.</P>
<P>WE may strike up bargains, and make contracts by proxy, but all men must work out their own salvation in person. How irrational is a late re∣pentance. Must the body be besieged with sick∣ness, before the work be done on which eternal life depends.</P>

</LG>
<P>HE who repents truly, is greatly sorrowful for his past sins; not with a superficial sigh or tear,
<PB N="219" REF="028841_0219_0FDDDBFBC09C1120"/>
but a pungeant afflictive sorrow; such a sorrow as hates the sin so much, that the man would rather chuse to die than act it any more. A holy life is the only perfection of repentance, and the firm ground upon which we can cast the anchor of our hopes, in the mercies of God through Jesus Christ. A true penitent must all the days of his life pray for pardon, nor think the work compleated till he dies.</P>

These, which by themselves, constitute a good heart, when joined to a good head, naturally give a greater tendency to virtue than vice: For they are naturally charmed with beauty, and disgusted with every kind of deformity.

<HEAD>SOLITUDE.</HEAD>
<P>SOLITUDE is a rare attainment, and shews a well disposed mind, when a man loves to keep company with himself; and a virtue as well as advantage to take satisfaction, and content in that enjoyment.</P>
<P>SOLITUDE can be well fitted, and sit right, but upon very few persons. They must have know∣ledge enough of the world to see the follies of it, and virtue enough to despise all vanity.</P>
<P>THAT calm and elegant satisfaction which the vulgar call melancholy, is the true and proper de∣light of men of knowledge and virtue. What we take for diversion, is but a mean entertainment, in comparison of knowing ourselves.</P>
<P>SIR Henry Wotton who had gone on several ombassios, and was intimate with the greatest
<PB N="229" REF="028841_0229_0FDDDC15D4792278"/>
princes, chose to retire from all; saying, the ut∣most happiness a man could attain to, was to be at leisure to be, and to do good; never reflecting on his former years, but with tears, he would say, how much have I to repent of, and how little time to do it in.</P>
<P>TRUE happiness is of a retired nature, and an enemy to pomp and noises. It arises, in the first place from the enjoyment of one's self; and, in the next, from the friendship and conversation of a few select companions.</P>
<P>THOUGH the continued traverses of fortune, may make us out of humour with the world; yet nothing but a noble inclination to virtue and phi∣losophy can make us happy in retirement.</P>
<P>I PREFER a private to a public life. For I love my friends, and therefore love but few.</P>
<P>THE late amiable Mr. Shenstone used frequently to say, that he was never more happy than when alone, except when he had his friends about him. There are, says he, indeed, some few whom I properly call my friends, and in whose company I cannot but be more happy than in any solitary in∣dulgences of imagination: But how seldom it is that you will allow me these extraordinary indulg∣ences.</P>

WHEN the heart has long been used to the de∣lightful society of beloved friends, how dreadful is absence, and how irksome is solitude.

<HEAD>SECRECY.</HEAD>
<P>SECRETS are edge tools, and must be kept from children and from fools.</P>
<P>HE who trusts a secret to his servant, makes his own man his master.</P>
<P>SECRECY is the cement of friendship. When Ulysses departed to repair the siege of Troy; in his charge to his friend respecting the care of Tel∣emachus, who was then in his infancy, he, among other things thus entreats them, "above all forget not to render him just, beneficient, sin∣cere, and faithful in keeping secrets." And it is
<PB N="231" REF="028841_0231_0FDDDC1AE8EA3288"/>
afterwards made a great part in the character of Telemachus, that he knew how to keep a secret, without telling any untruths, and yet could lay aside that close mysterious air so common to people that are reserved. He did not seem oppressed with the burden of the secret he kept; he always seem∣ed easy, natural, open, as one that carried his heart upon his lips. But at the same time, that he would tell you every thing that was of no consequence, he knew how to stop just in the proper moment, and without proceeding to those things which might raise some suspicion, and give a hint of his secret. By this means his heart was impenetrable and inaccessible.</P>
<P>A MAN without secrecy is an open letter for every one to read.</P>
<P>THE itch of knowing secrets is naturally attend∣ed with another itch of telling things.</P>
<LG>
<L>Premeditate your speeches, words once flown</L>
<L>Are in the hearers power—not our own.</L>
</LG>
<P>A PROPER secrecy is the only mystery of able men, mystery is the only secrecy of weak and cun∣ning ones. The man who tells nothing, or who tells all, will equally have nothing told him. If a fool knows a secret, he tells it because he is a fool; if
<PB N="232" REF="028841_0232_0FDDDC1E5C28F818"/>
a knave knows one, he tells it wherever it will be his interest to tell it. There are some occasions in which a man must tell half his secret, in order to conceal the rest; but there is seldom one in which a man must tell all. Great skill is necessary, to know how far to go, and where to stop.</P>

<HEAD>SERIOUSNESS.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING excellent can be done without se∣riousness, and he that courts wisdom must be in earnest. A serious man is one that duly and im∣partially weighs the moments of things, so as nei∣ther to value trifles, nor dispise things really excel∣lent; that dwells much at home, and studies to know himself, as well as men and books; that considers why he came into the world, how great his business, and how short his stay; how uncer∣tain

it is when we shall leave it, and whether a sinner shall then betake himself, when both heaven and earth shall fly before the presence of the judge; considers God is always present; and the folly of doing what must be repented of, and of going to hell, when a man may go to heaven. In a word, that knows how to distinguish between a moment and eternity.</P>
<P>NOTHING is more rediculous, than to be seri∣ous about trifles, and to be trifling about serious matters.</P>

<P>SLANDER is a propensity of mind to think ill of all men, and afterwards to utter such senti∣ments in scandalous expressions.</P>
<P>SLANDERERS are a species of creatures, so great a scandal to human nature as scarce to deserve the name of men. They are in general, a composition of the most detestable vices, pride, envy, hatred, lying, uncharitableness, &amp;c▪ and yet it is a la∣mentable truth, these wretches swarm in every town, and lurk in every village; and actuated by these base principles, are ever busy in attacking the characters of mankind; none are too great or too good to escape the level of their envenomed darts. If in high life they find the greatest worth, or a man in a middle station, sober, honest, industrious and aspiring, it is odds that his merit alone imme∣diately excites them to exercise their malignant
<PB N="235" REF="028841_0235_0FDDDC24B09D82C8"/>
tongue, and their souls rest not, 'till their bags of∣poison are quite exhausted. However shocking to the well cultivated mind this assertion may ap∣pear, the truth is too flagrant, and of too easy in∣vestigation to admit of the least doubt. What ac∣count such unhappy creatures will be able to ren∣der hereafter, for so great an abuse of their time and talents, so unpardonable an injury to their neighbour, and so black a violation of the com∣mand of the gospel, "love one another," is not difficult to guess, nor agreeable to think on.</P>

<P>SPENCER in his Fairy Queen, Book IV. cant. 8. after representing slander as an old woman, sitting on the ground, in a little cottage, goes on,
<Q><L>With filthy locks about her scatter'd wide,</L>
<L>Gnawing her nails for fellness and for ire,</L>
<L><PB N="236" REF="028841_0236_0FDDDC25080982A8"/>
And thereout sucking venom, to her parts entire.</L>
<L>A soul, and loathly creature sure in sight,</L>
<L>And in conditions to be loath'd no less:</L>
<L>For she was stuft with rancour and despite</L>
<L>Up to the throat; that oft' with bitterness</L>
<L>It forth would break, and gush in great excess,</L>
<L>Pouring out streams of poison, and of gall,</L>
<L>'Gainst all that truth or virtue do profess;</L>
<L>Whom she with leasings lewdly did miscall,</L>
<L>And wickedly backbite: Her name men slander call.</L>
<L>Her nature is, all goodness to abuse,</L>
<L>And causeless crimes continually to frame:</L>
<L>With which she guiltless persons may accuse,</L>
<L>And steal away the crown of their good name.</L></Q></P>
<P>CALUMNY is a filthy and pernicious infection of the tongue, for it is generally aimed, by the most wicked and abandoned part of mankind, against the most worthy, and most deserving of esteem, and wounds them unexpectedly. And to whom is it pleasing? To the most vile and perfid∣ious, the talkative. But what is its source? From what origin does it proceed? From falshoood for its father, and envy for its mother, and from curi∣osity for its nurse.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="028841_0237_0FDDDC2929E61300"/>
NOR is calumny itself without an offspring; for it not only begets strife and contention, hatred and malice, bloodshed and murder; but nourishes other destructive evils. And now let us enquire, what is the antidote to this disease? Innocence and patience. Innocence enables us to bear it, and patience blunts its edge.—When you hear any one ill spoken of in your company, which happens but too often, mingle not the poison of your malignant reflections, nor bid higher than the rest in the auction of slander, much less be the messenger of such abuses to the person concerned.</P>
<LG>
<L>Those who are given most to railing,</L>
<L>We find have oft the greatest failing.</L>
</LG>
<P>TEN thousand are the vehicles in which the deadly poison of slander is prepared and communi∣cated to the world—and by some artful hands, it is done by so subtle and nice an infusion, that it is not to be tasted or discovered but by its effects. How frequently is the honesty and integrity of a man disposed of, by a smile or shrug.—How many good generous actions have been sunk into obliv∣ion, by a distrustful look—or stamped with the im∣putation of proceeding from bad motives, by a mysterious and seasonable whisper. Look into the
<PB N="238" REF="028841_0238_0FDDDC2D0D47A0B0"/>
companies of those whose gentle natures should disarm them, we shall find little better account.—How large a portion of chastity is sent out of the world by distant hints—nodded away, and cruelly winked into suspicion, by envy. How often does the reputation of a helpless creature, bleed from report—which the party who is at the pains to propagate it—hopes in God it is not true, but in the mean time is resolved to give the report her pass, &amp;c.</P>
<P>THERE are some wounds given to reputation, that are like the wounds of an envenomed arrow; where we irritate and enlarge the orifice while we extract the bearded weapon; yet cannot the cure be compleated otherwise.</P>
<P>WHEN a man of distinguished worth suffers un∣merited calumny, it often has the same effect as an eclipse of the sun; which serves only to make it admired the more. While it shines in unvaried light and splendor, it shines unnoticed; but when it is obscured by some sudden and unexpected darkness, it attracts our attention, and emerges with an unusual and superior eclat.</P>
<P>IN this age, in some companies, there remains nothing, when you have done with public affairs, and public diversions, but private anecdotes—pulling down, or gently undermining characters,
<PB N="239" REF="028841_0239_0FDDDC304AD5B650"/>
sitting in judgment upon those transactions, which, though of a private nature, are, by the newly es∣tablished custom of the times, laid before the pub∣lic—or producing fresh accounts of them from private hands. I hardly ever hear a conversation of this kind carried on for half an hour, without some flagrant instance of slander and injustice. It is amazing to observe the courage with which, upon mere common report, facts are repeated, which tend to the utter ruin of a character, and even motives confidently assigned, which, it was impossible should be known.</P>
<P>THE heaviest misfortune will not shelter you from censure, when the conversation takes this turn. If you have lost your dearest friend, we pity you indeed; but we cannot help observing, either that you have very litte feeling, and do not grieve enough, or that you are highly blameable in feeling too much, and grieving too violently; or else, that there is something very ridiculous in your manner of shewing your griefs, or in some circumstance of your behaviour under it. If you are stripped of your whole fortune, 'tis a terrible thing to be sure, but it can't be dissembled, that your own impudence was in a great measure the cause of it.</P>

<L>When cruel slander takes her impious flight,</L>
<L>What man's secure against her baleful sway?</L>
<L>Virtue herself must sink in shades of night,</L>
<L>And spotless innocence must fall a prey:</L>
<L>With guile elated, and malicious leer,</L>
<L>Her neighbours fame she wantonly destroys;</L>
<L>No cruel treatment seems to her severe,</L>
<L>Vile defamation all her time employs.</L>
<L>How base the bosom whence vile slanders flow,</L>
<L>There sweet content and downy peace ne'er dwell</L>
<L>But all the pangs of misery surprise,</L>
<L>Of torment and remorse the dreadful cell.</L>
</LG>
<P>THE best dispositions have usually the most sen∣sibility. They have also that delicate regard for reputation, which renders them sorely afflicted by the attacks of calumny. It is not an unreasonable and excessive self love, but a regard to that without which, a feeling mind cannot be happy, which renders many of us attentive to every word which is whispered of us in our absence.</P>
<P>NO virtue, no prudence, no caution, no gene∣rosity can preserve us from misrepresentation. Our conduct must be misunderstood by weak intelects, and by those who only see a part of it, and hastily form a judgment of the whole. Every man of eminence has those in his vicinity who hate, who
<PB N="241" REF="028841_0241_0FDDDC348410DCF0"/>
envy, and who affect to despise him. These will see his actions with a jaundiced eye, and will re∣present them to others in the colours in which they themselves behold them.</P>
<P>LET the weak and ill natured enjoy the poor pleasure of whispering calumny and detraction, and let the man of sense display the wisdom and dignity of disregarding them. The dogs bay the moon, but the moon still shines on in its beautiful serenity and lustre, and moves on in its orbit with undisturbed regularity.</P>

<HEAD>SOUL.</HEAD>
<P>LET us duly learn to prize and value our soul; is the body such a valuable piece? what then is the soul? the body is but a husk, or shell; the soul is the kernel; the body is but the cask; the soul is the precious liquor contained in it. The body is but the cabinet, the soul is the jewel. The body is but the dwelling, the soul the inhabitant. The body is but the lanthorn, the soul or spirit the candle of the Lord, that burns in it. And seeing there is such difference between the soul and the body in respect of excellency, sure our better part challen∣ges our greater care and diligence, to make provi∣sion for it. Bodily provision is but half provision; it is but one part, and that the meaner and more ignoble too, if we consider only the time of this life; But if we consider a future state of endless duration after this life, then bodily provision will
<PB N="243" REF="028841_0243_0FDDDC38F67FC070"/>
appear to be but no provision at all, in comparison, there being no proportion between so short a period of time, and the infinite ages of eternity. Our great partiality towards our bodies, and neglect of our souls, shews clearly what part we prefer; we are careful enough in not wounding or maiming our bodies; but we make bold to lash and wound our souls daily. We are industrious enough to preserve our bodies from slavery, &amp;c. but we make nothing of suffering our souls to be slaves and drudges to lust, and to live in the vilest bondage to the most degenerate of creatures, the devil.</P>
<P>WE arm and defend our bodies, and our souls have as much need of armour as they, for the life of a Christian is a continual warfare, and we have potent and vigilant enemies to encounter withal, the devil, the world, and this corrupt flesh we carry about with us. We had need therefore, to put on the whole armour of God that we may be able to stand in the evil day, and having done all may stand, having ourselves girt with truth, and having the breast plate of righteousness; above all, taking the shield of faith, and for a hemlet, the hope of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God.—Ephes. vi. 13, 14.</P>
<P>I NEVER had a sight of my soul, says the empe∣ror Aurelius, and yet I have a great value for it,
<PB N="244" REF="028841_0244_0FDDDC3AB6D6A2A0"/>
because it is discoverable by its operations: And by my constant experience of the power of God, I have a proof of his being, and a reason for my ve∣naration.</P>
<P>I AM as certain that there is a God above, (says Sterne) as that I myself am here below—for how otherwise did I come here?—He must love virtue, and detest vice; consequently, he must both re∣ward and punish.

<P>THERE is but little need to drive away that time by foolish divertisements, which flies away so swiftly of itself, and when once gone, can nev∣er be recalled.</P>
<P>AN idle person is a kind of monster in the cre∣ation; all nature is buisy about him. How wretch∣ed is it to hear people complain, that the day hangs heavy upon them, that they do not know what to do with themselves. How monstrous are such ex∣pressions among creatures, who can apply them∣selves to the duties of religion and meditation; to the reading of useful books; who may exercise themselves in the pursuits of knowledge and vir∣tue, and every hour of their lives, make them∣selves wiser and better.</P>
<P>SHOULD the greatest part of people sit down, and draw a particular account of their time, what a shameful bill would it be? So much extraordinary for eating, drinking and sleeping, beyond what nature requires; so much in revelling and wanton∣ness; so much for the recovery of last night's in∣temperance; so much for gaming, plays and mas∣querades;
<PB N="251" REF="028841_0251_0FDDDC4BB7BB6908"/>
so much in paying and receiving formal and impertinent visits, in idle and foolish prating, in censuring and reviling our neighbours; so much in dressing, and talking of fashions; and so much lost and wasted in doing nothing.</P>
<P>THERE is no man but hath a soul, and, if he will look carefully to that, he need not complain for want of business. Where there are so many corruptions to mortify, so many inclinations to watch over, so many temptations to resist, the graces of God to improve, and former neglects of all these to lament, sure he can never want suffi∣cient employment. For all these require time, and so men at their deaths find; for those who have lived carelessly, and wasted their time, would then give them all to redeem it.</P>
<P>IT was a memorable practice of Vespasian, thro' the whole course of his life; he called himself to an account every night for the actions of the past day, and so often as he found he had skipped any one day without doing some good, he entered upon his diary this memorial, "<HI>I have lost a day.</HI>"</P>
<P>IF time, like money, could be laid by, while one was not using it—there might be some excuse for the idleness of half the world—but yet not a full one; for even this would be such an economy, as the living on a principle sum, with∣out making it purchase interest.</P>

TIME is one of the most precious jewels which we possess; but its true value is seldom known till it is near a close, and when it is not in our power to redeem it. The right improvement of time is of the greatest consequence to mankind. The present moment is only ours. The present moment calls for dispatch; and, if neglected, it is a great chance if ever we get another opportunity. To day we live, tomorrow we may die. Besides, we have a great work to do, and an appointed time in which it must be done. The uncertainty of this time adds much to its brevity; the velocity of it urges its improvement the more. Seneca observes, We all complain of the shortness of time, but spend it in such a manner, as if we had too much.</P>
<P>THE time we live ought not to be computed to by the number of years, but by the use which has been made of it: It is not the extent of ground, but the yearly rent which gives the value to the estate. Wretched and thoughtless creatures! in the only place where covetousness were a virtue, we turn prodigals! nothing lies upon our hands with such uneasiness, nor has there been so many devices for any one thing, as to make time glide away imper∣ceptibly and to no purpose. A shilling shall be hoarded up with care whilst that which is above the price of an estate, is flung away with disregard and contempt.</P>
