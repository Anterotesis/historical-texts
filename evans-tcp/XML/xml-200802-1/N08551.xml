<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT may at first view seem a little presuming in me, to dedicate a plain law-treatise to a polite nobleman, such as your lord∣ship; but this will be easily reconciled, when 'tis considered, the subject of our law, cannot be made too familiar to the greatest personages, as they live under it's protection, and are by it defend∣ed in their rights and properties.</P>
<P>In this address to your lordship, where virtues are so very con∣spicuous, extraordinary encomiums may be well expected; and I fear I shall require your lordship's pardon for my defects; I shall however presume to observe to you, if generosity and greatness of mind, superior sense, learning and judgment, the noblest oeco∣nomy, and finest behaviour, with the most entensive publick spirit, are excellencies which deservedly raise a person to titles and honours, they ever belong to your lordship as their possessor.</P>
<P>These great qualities and accomplishments, my lord, shine forth in you, who are universally known and admired; and that you may live long an ornament to your country, attended with prosperity and every satisfaction, is the real wish of,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE> <SIGNED>Your Lordship's Most Obedient, and Most devoted Humble Servant, <HI>G. J.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN an age of enquiry into things, it is not to be admired that our great legislators should make many new laws well intended for redressing publick evils, however short they may fall of it, in the general execution of them: for there is hardly any fence so strong, but the fertile genius of the present times, by its inventions and stratagems, will easily break through it.</P>
<P>But I do not here pretend to be a particular advocate, either for or against the alteration of our laws, any further than as it makes new books necessary; what I shall now attempt, is to introduce an instructive treatise, writ in the easiest method, and adapted to every capacity, whereby the unskilful, and those who are igno∣rant in practice of the law, may in some measure be their own advisers, and readily avoid the common errors too often happening in the prosecution of suits.</P>
<P>And in this treatise is contained the most useful and requisite learning in the law, for all degrees of persons to acquire and un∣derstand, there being likewise many curious things therein not to be found in any other one law book; so that I may venture to say, the publick will here reap benefit and security to themselves, at the same time attornies and solicitors confess it affords a very just instruction.</P>
<P>Nor will these gentlemen, I hope, make any objection to the popularity of my title, since this work is not designed to defame or abate the profession of the law, tho' it gives some light into it to the ordinary reader.</P>
<P>This edition has been revised and corrected, and many valuable additions inserted from the reports of the late lord chief baron <HI>Comyn;</HI> lord chief justice <HI>Raymond; Strange,</HI> master of the rolls; Mr. justice <HI>Foster, &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> And also from the statute law to the fourth year of the reign of his present Majesty inclusive.</P>

<P>Action of <HI>Debt</HI> is a suit given by law where a man oweth ano∣ther a certain sum of money, by obligation, or bargain for a thing sold, or by contract, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the debtor will not pay the debt at the day agreed; then the creditor shall have this action against him for the same.</P>
<P>If money be due upon any specialty, action of debt only lieth; for no other action may be brought for it: and where a man con∣tracts to pay money for things which he hath bought, and the sel∣ler takes bond for the money, the contract is discharged; so that he shall not have action of debt upon the contract, but on the bond. <HI>Nat. Br.</HI> 268.</P>
<P>The usual action of debt, which consists of divers particular branches, lies in all these cases:
<LIST>
<PB N="2" REF="010935_0004_0F852D3FF72BCF50"/>
<ITEM>1. For money due on bond, or bill.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. For rent due from tenants.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. For goods or money delivered.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. For an attorney's expences.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. For permitting a prisoner to escape.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Upon a judgment, or arbitrament.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. On an act of parliament.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. In a bond where several are bound severally, the obligee may have action of debt against all the obligors together, or all of them apart, and have several judgments and executions; though he shall have satisfaction but once: but when the bond is joint, and not several, all the obligers must be sued that are bound; and one is not obliged to answer without the rest. Also if a bond is made to three to pay money to one of them, they must all join in the acti∣on, for they are but as one obligee. <HI>Dy.</HI> 19, 310. <HI>Yelv.</HI> 177.</P>
<P>If there be several days mentioned for payment of money on a bond, the obligation is no forfeited, nor can be sued until all the days are past: yet in some cases, the obligee may bring action of debt for the money due by the bond presently, though it be not forfeited; and by special wording the condition, an obligee may be able to sue the penalty on the first default. A man is bound to pay 20 <HI>l.</HI> in manner following, that is to say, 10<HI>l.</HI> at one day, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0<HI>l.</HI> at another; debt will not lie till after the last day, because it is an intire duty: but if one binds himself to pay 10 <HI>l.</HI> on one day, and 10 <HI>l.</HI> on another, after the first day action of debt lies for 10 <HI>l.</HI> it being a several duty. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 292. 2 <HI>Danv. Abr.</HI> 501.</P>
<P>In action of debt brought upon a bond against an heir for the debt of his ancestor, it is not good for the heir to say, that the ex∣ecutors have assets in their hands; for the obligee may sue either heir or executor: if an heir hath assets, and the executor also, it is at the obligee's election to have action of debt against the one or the other; but he shall not charge them doubly. Debt lies a∣gainst the heir of an obligor, who has lands by descent, if the ex∣ecutors have not sufficient: and if an heir has made over lands fallen to him by descent, execution shall be had against him to the value of the land, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> if it be not sold <HI>bona fide</HI> before the action brought. <HI>Dy.</HI> 204. <HI>Plowd.</HI> 433. <HI>Ander.</HI> 7. <HI>Stat.</HI> 3 <HI>&amp;</HI> 4 <HI>W. &amp; M. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> 14. perpetuated by 6 <HI>&amp;</HI> 7 <HI>W.</HI> 3. <HI>c.</HI> 14.</P>
<P>Action of debt lieth on a recognizance; so upon a statute mer∣chant, being in the nature of a bond or obligation: but it is other∣wise in case of a statute staple. A man owes another a sum of mo∣ney, and hath his note under hand, without seal, an action of debt on a <HI>mutuatus</HI> lies; but the defendant may wage his law: in action
<PB N="3" REF="010935_0004_0F852D3FF72BCF50"/>
of the case brought upon promise of payment the defendant cannot wage law. 4 <HI>Rep.</HI> 93. 2 <HI>Danv. Abr.</HI> 497.</P>
<P>If debt is brought on a single bill, the defendant may plead pay∣ment, before the action brought, in bar▪ and pending an action on bond, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the defendant may bring in principal, interest and costs; and the court shall give judgment to discharge the defendant, by stat. 4 <HI>Ann. c.</HI> 16. <HI>s.</HI> 13.</P>
<P>Upon application to stay an action of debt upon bond, upon payment of principal, interest and costs: cause shewn and oppo∣sed, unless costs of a suit in the <HI>Exchequer</HI> relating to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he same mat∣ter be paid. Lord Ch. Just. <HI>Hardwicke</HI> said, he believed it had been ruled upon the above clause that it should be done; and that costs and equity relating to suits on bonds have been referred to, and taxed by the master. Rule absolute to stay the proceedings on payment of principal, interest and costs, and of the costs in the <HI>Exchequer.</HI> M.S.S. Cas. <HI>East.</HI> 8 Geo. 2. <HI>Lock</HI> and <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ermer.</HI> See <HI>Gilb.</HI> Cas. 291.</P>
<P>An executor brought error on a judgment against the testator upon bond: and after affirmance moved on stat. 4 <HI>Ann. c.</HI> 16. <HI>sect.</HI> 13. to pay principal, interest and costs, it was insisted, that as he came for a favour to save the penalty, it was but equitable he should pay the costs in error which he had put the plaintiff to; for if plaintiff had taken execution, equity would never punish him for taking those expences out of the penalty.</P>
<P>On the other side were cited <HI>Baynham</HI> v. <HI>Matthews,</HI> 2 <HI>Str.</HI> 871. where an executor discontinued without costs. 2 <HI>Kel.</HI> 70. <HI>pl.</HI> 28. S.P. 2 <HI>Barnard. K. B.</HI> 154. S.C. S.P. and <HI>Sidney</HI> v. <HI>Newinson.</HI> Upon the authority of which case, the court determined, that as by law the executor was not to pay costs upon a writ of error, a court of law could not direct them to be taxed, though there was a penal∣ty. 2 <HI>Str.</HI> 1072.</P>
<P>The case of <HI>Sidney</HI> v. <HI>Newinson</HI> was, That plaintiff had brought an action of debt upon bond against defendant as administrator, and filed a bill in equity to discover assets; and had instituted a suit in the spiritual court, to oblige her to give in an inventory. After judgment for the plaintiff in the action, a writ of error was brought in <HI>K. B.</HI> and the judgment reversed. Then plaintiff brought a new action in <HI>K. B.</HI> and defendant moved to stay proceedings upon stat. 4 <HI>Ann. c.</HI> 16. <HI>sect.</HI> 13. on paying principal, interest, and costs; and now upon motion for the court's direction to the master in tax∣ing the costs, it was insisted for plaintiff, that defendant ought to pay the whole costs of the first suit, proceedings in <HI>Chancery,</HI> and spiritual court.</P>
<P>The court said, that they had nothing to do to order costs for
<PB N="4" REF="010935_0005_0F852D4093D1F1B0"/>
proceedings in another court, which has no power to award costs, if the party is intitled to them; and as to the judgment that is re∣versed, there is no reason for defendant to pay for plaintiff's error and mistake. The court was of opinion, the proceedings in this court must be stayed on payment of the costs of this suit. <HI>Str.</HI> 699.</P>
<P N="2">2. An action of debt lies for rent in arrear, upon a lease for life or years; at common law it lay not on leases for life, but now by statute it may be had. 8 <HI>Ann. c.</HI> 14. If tenant in fee-simple, or fee-tail die, his executor may have action of debt by the stat. 32 <HI>H.</HI> 8. <HI>c.</HI> 37. for arrears of rent incurred in the life-time of such tenants, or he may distrain for the same; but before this act the executor had no remedy. <HI>Cro. Car.</HI> 471.</P>
<P>The remedy by the common law for rent on a lease for life was assise, if the plaintiff had seisin, or by distress; and if tenant for life died, his executors might bring action of debt for the rent in arrear: but a new remedy is given by the above statute, and that is to distrain. 3 <HI>Rep.</HI> 65. 3 <HI>Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k.</HI> 304.</P>
<P>If a rent or lease for years of land is reserved and made payable at four quarter-days, the lessor may have action of debt after the first day of failure; for every quarter's rent is a several debt, and distinct actions may be brought for each quarter. 5 <HI>Rep.</HI> 81. 2 <HI>Vent.</HI> 129. An assignee of rent upon a lease for years, shall have debt for it: and action of debt will lie against a lessee, for rent due after the as∣signment of the lease; for the personal privity of contract continues, though the privity of estate is gone: but it is otherwise, if a landlord once accepts the rent of the assignee, knowing of the assignment. <HI>Lev.</HI> 22. 3 <HI>Rep.</HI> 22, 23.</P>
<P>When the lease is ended, the duty in respect of the rent remains, and debt lieth by reason of privity of contract between lessor and lessee. <HI>Cro. Jac.</HI> 227.</P>
<P N="3">3. Action of debt lieth upon a parol contract by word only, and so doth action on the case: and in some cases, debt will lie, al∣though there be no contract betwixt the party that brings the acti∣on, and him against whom brought; for there may be a duty crea∣ted by law. But action of debt lieth not against executors, upon a simple contract made by the testator: though it lies for the ar∣rearages of an account against executors, of receipts by the testator. 2 <HI>Saund.</HI> 343. 9 <HI>Rep.</HI> 87. <HI>Lil. Abr.</HI> 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3. 2 <HI>Danv. Abr.</HI> 497.</P>
<P>If goods or money are delivered to a third person for my use, I may have action of debt or account for them. And where money is de∣livered to a person, to be re-delivered again, the property is altered, and debt lies: but where a horse, or any goods are thus delivered, there action of detinue lieth. Action of debt lies against the hus∣band, for goods which were delivered or sold to the wife, if they
<PB N="5" REF="010935_0005_0F852D4093D1F1B0"/>
come to the husband's use: and if one delivers meat, drink or clothes to an infant, and he promises to pay for them, action of debt or on the case will be against the infant; but what is delivered, must be averred to be for the necessary use of the infant. 2 <HI>Danv. Abr.</HI> 404. <HI>Nels. Abr.</HI> 603. <HI>Lil. Abr.</HI> 400, 401.</P>
<P>A man agrees with a taylor to make him a suit of clothes, for a certain price; the taylor may bring a general action of debt against him for the money; but if the price is not agreed on, action of the case only lies, or special action of debt on the special contract. <HI>Wood's Inst.</HI> 9th edit. 563.</P>
<P N="4">4. At attorney shall have action of debt against his client, for money which he has paid to any person for such client, for costs of suit, or to his counsel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And an action of bebt, or case, lies for an attorney for his fees against him that retained him in his cause: but attornies are not to demand more than their just fees; nor to be allowed any extraordinary fees to counsel, without tickets signed by them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And it is said to be a good plea to an action brought by an attorney for his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ees, that the plaintiff did not give the de∣fendant any bill of charges, according to the stat. <HI>Lil. Abr.</HI> 142. <HI>Stat.</HI> 3 <HI>Jac. c.</HI> 7. <HI>T. Raym.</HI> 245. 2 <HI>Geo.</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 23. perpetuated by 30 <HI>Geo.</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 19. <HI>s.</HI> 75.

<P>If a client, when his business in court is dispatched, refuseth to pay the officer his court fees; the court on motion will grant an at∣tachment against him, on which he shall be committed until the fees are paid. <HI>Lil. Abr.</HI> 598.</P>
<P>But officers guilty of extortion shall render treble value: and an action may be brought against attornies for extortion, and the party grieved shall have treble damages and costs. 3 <HI>Ed. c.</HI> 26, 27, 30.</P>
<P N="5">5. Action of debt lies against a ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ler permitting a prisoner com∣mitted in execution to escape, for thereupon the law makes the gaoler debtor; and where the party is not in execution, there ac∣tion on the case lieth for damages suffered by the escape. <HI>Saund.</HI> 218.</P>
<P>If a prisoner escapes who was in execution, his creditor may re∣take him by <HI>capias ad satisficiendum;</HI> or bring action of debt on the judgment, or a <HI>scire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acias</HI> against him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for he hath still an in∣terest in the body, as a pledge for the debt. If the prisoner makes a tortious escape, the person at whose suit he was taken in execution, may have an <HI>alias cap.</HI> to take him again; or action of the case a∣gainst the sheriff: but if the sheriff voluntarily permit the escape, debt may be brought against the sheriff. <HI>Ventr.</HI> 269. <HI>Lil.

<P>Debt lieth against a sheriff, for money levied in execution: and if a defendant in execution is rescued, the sheriff is liable for the

And of writs there are divers kinds, in many respects; some are real, concerning the possession of lands, called writs of entry, or of right touching the property, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Some are personal, relating to goods, chattels, and personal inju∣ries;
<PB N="7" REF="010935_0006_0F852D425CBA6E60"/>
and some are mixed, for the recovery of the thing and da∣mages. 2 <HI>Inst.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>The writs, in civil actions are either original, or judicial; origi∣nal writs are issued out of the court of chancery, for the summon∣ing a defendant to appea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> writs issue out of the court where th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> original is returned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> after the suit is begun, to carry on the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se: the originals bear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>te in the name of the king; but judicial writs bear date in the name of the chief justice; and a writ without a teste is not good, for the time may be material when it was ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> out; and if it be out of the common law courts, it must bear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> some day in term (not being <HI>sunday</HI>) but in chancery writs may be issued in the vacation as well as term-time, as that court is always open: also there are to be fifteen days between the teste and return of writs, where the suit is by original; but by statute, de∣lays in actions by reason of fifteen days between the teste and re∣turn in personal actions and ejectments are remedied. <HI>F.

<P>An original writ defective in form, is abateable; but it is allowed to be good by pleadings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and though an original may not be amended, yet a new writ may be taken out, where it is not amend∣able: writs judicial, if erroneous, may be amended; and writs may be renewed every term, until a defendant is arrested, but not after four terms in <HI>B.

<P>The king's writs cannot be denied to the subject; and after the action is fixed on, for a wrong done, or a right detained, as in debt, on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> such a writ must be taken out as is suitable to the action, being grounded upon it: and if in the writ several persons are included, (for four defendants may be put in one writ) there must be several warrants from the sheriff to execute the same. <HI>Wood's Inst.</HI> 581.</P>
<P>Attachment lies against sheriffs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for not executing writs; or for doing it oppressively by force, or not doing it effectually, thro' any corrupt practice.

<P>If your <HI>capias</HI> be in action of the <HI>case,</HI> then say: <HI>To answer to the said</HI> A. B. <HI>according to the custom of our court of Common Bench, in a certain plea of trespass on the case, upon promises; to the damage of the said</HI> A. <HI>twenty pound,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. Bail is security for the appearance of the defendant, at a day and place certain, to answer the plaintiff's suit. And in all cases where process issues forth of <HI>K. B.</HI> to take the defendant's body, if an appearance only, and not special bail is required, there the de∣fendant may appear in court in his proper person, and file common bail. <HI>Lil. Abr.</HI> 85.</P>
<P>There is both common and special bail: Common bail is in ac∣tions of small concernment; being called common, because any sureties, as <HI>John Doe</HI> and <HI>Richard Roe,</HI> in that case are taken; whereas in cases of greater weight<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as actions upon bond or speci∣alty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> where the debt amount to 10<HI>l.</HI> or above, (of which an a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>idavit of the debt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> how to be made) special bail or surety must be taken, such as subsidy-men at least, and they according to the value. 4 <HI>Inst.</HI> 179.</P>
<P>As there are different kinds of bail; so there are divers sorts of bail-pieces, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. A common bail-piece, where the defendant is served with a copy of the process; this is merely to bring the de∣fendant into court, and is in nature of an appearance in the court of Common Pleas. 2. A special bail-piece on a <HI>cepi corpus,</HI> or ar∣rest returned, when the defendant is actually arrested, and the she∣riff hath taken a bail-bond. 3. A bail-piece on an <HI>habeas corpus,</HI> in case a defendant lives at a great distance from <HI>Westminster,</HI> and a cause is removed out of an inferior court. 4. Bail-pieces taken be∣fore commissioners in the country, by virtue of the stat. 4 <HI>W. &amp; M. c.</HI> 4.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="010935_0009_0F852D445967B150"/>
These bail-pieces, if common, are to be filed in the office within six days after the end of the term the attorney appears: and special bail, which is taken before a judge, or by commissioners, when accepted, is to be filed; after 20 days notice given of putting in special bail before a judge on a <HI>cepi corpus,</HI> if there is no exception, the bail shall be filed in four days. Upon a <HI>habeas corpus,</HI> 28 days allowed to except against the bail, and after that, if it be not ex∣cepted against, it shall be filed in four days. <HI>Lil. Abr.</HI> 174. <HI>Salk.</HI> 89.</P>
<P>Bail is not properly such till it is filed; but it shall be accounted good, till the same is questioned and disallowed. And when cog∣nisors of bail are questioned, they must justify themselves in open court by oath of their abilies; or before one of the judges of the court; or by affidavit before the commissioners as took the bail: and the court may adjudge bail sufficient; when the plaintiff will not accept it. Also a defendant, with leave of the court, may de∣posit money in court instead of bail: and the court on motion, or a judge at his chamber, will order a common appearance to be taken, when special bail is not required. <HI>Lil. Abr.</HI></P>
<P>If the defendant doth not find common or special bail, the at∣torney for the plaintiff is to call upon the sheriff for the return of the writ; on default whereof, a rule being made for it, the sheriff shall be amerced, or summoned before a judge to shew cause, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and if on a <HI>cepi corpus</HI> no bail is returned, a rule will be made out to bring in the defendant's body. When a sheriff hath taken good bail of the defendant, he will on a rule return a <HI>cepi,</HI> and assign the bail-bond to the plaintiff; which may be done by indorsement, without stamp, so as it be stamped before action brought thereup∣on; and then if the bail-bond, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> be forfeited, the plaintiff may bring his action on the bond in his own name. <HI>Stat.</HI> 4 <HI>&amp;</HI> 5 <HI>An.</HI> But upon such assignment of a bail-bond and action brought thereon, neither defendant nor bail can be arrested on the bond, but served only with a copy of the process; for otherwise bail might be taken <HI>ad infinitum.</HI></P>
<P>Sheriffs are to let to bail persons arrested, upon reasonable sure∣ties, having sufficient within the county, to keep their days in such place, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as the writs require. 23 <HI>H.</HI> 6. <HI>c.</HI> 10. And the statute 1 <HI>W. &amp; M. s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss.</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 2. provides against excessive bail. By late <HI>Orders</HI> of court, bail shall be liable for so much as is sworn to and indorsed on the process, or for a lesser sum; and not be dis∣charged though the plaintiff declares for more. On exception en∣tered against bail, the defendant must procure them to justify i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> four days, if in term, or on the first day of the next term, if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vacation. <HI>Ord. K. B. East.</HI> 5 <HI>Geo.</HI> 2. Altho' the bail taken by the sheriff on bail bonds is put in above, yet the plaintiff may except
<PB N="13" REF="010935_0009_0F852D445967B150"/>
against such bail: Special bail shall be perfected by the defendant within four days after exception, or in default the plaintiff may proceed on the bail-bond; and the like is to be observed on bail put in upon writs of error, or they may be <HI>non-prossed.</HI> No attor∣ney shall be bail; nor shall any bailiff be permitted to become bail in any action or suit. <HI>Ord. C. P. Mich.</HI> 5 <HI>Geo</HI> 2.</P>
<P>If a plaintiff does not declare against the defendant in two terms after bail is put in, the defendant may <HI>non-pross</HI> the plaintiff, and then the bail are discharged; for in such case the defendant is to go only upon common bail, by the rules of the court. If the defendant render himself to custody in discharge of his bail, upon the day of the return of the second writ of <HI>scire facias,</HI> against the bail, the court sitting, the bail shall be discharged: And the bail may bring in the body of the defendant, at any time before the re∣turn of the <HI>alias scire facias,</HI> and render him up, which will dis∣charge the bail; but care must be taken that the bail-piece be va∣cated in the office. <HI>Rol.

<P N="3">3. The declaration is a shewing in writing of the cause of com∣plaint of the plaintiff against the defendant, wherein the party is supposed to have received some wrong: It is an exposition of the writ, with the addition of time, circumstances, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and must be true, clear and certain; for the court is not to take things in it by implication.</P>
<P>A declaration is grounded upon the writ in the <HI>Common Pleas,</HI> and bill of <HI>Middlesex</HI> or <HI>latitat</HI> in the <HI>King's Bench;</HI> and one may not regularly declare in <HI>K.

If one be in the custody of the marshal of the court, for debt or other cause of Action, any plaintiff may file a declaration against him, and he is obliged to plead thereto; and it is the same when he is out upon bail, any other may declare against him, for he is bound to answer every one's suit, <HI>Lil. Abr.</HI> 413. When a declara∣tion is bad, if the defendant demurs, the plaintiff may set it right in a second action; but if the defendant do not take advantage of it, but pleads in bar, and the plaintiff proceeds to issue thereon; if the right is found for the defendant, the plaintiff is estopped by the verdict from bringing a new action: and so it is if he had de∣murred to the Plea in bar. <HI>Mod. Rep.</HI> 20, 207.</P>
<P>In real actions, the declaration is called a <HI>count;</HI> and in all acti∣ons it is good to lay sufficient damages therein. A plaintiff's attor∣ney may amend his declaration in <HI>K. B.</HI> in matter of form, after the general issue pleaded, before entry the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> without paying costs, or giving imparlance; but if he amends in substance, he must pay costs, or give an imparlance: and if he amend in substance, after a special plea pleaded, although he would give imparlance, he is to pay costs. Where a declaration is defective, it is sometimes aided by the statutes of <HI>Jeofails, &amp;c.</HI> but they help only matters of form, not matters of substance; for uncertainty in a declaration, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> is matter of substance, is not aided by statute after verdict. 5 <HI>Rep.</HI> 35. <HI>Lil. Abr.</HI> 409.</P>
<P>All declarations are to be filed, before which they are not of re∣cord to warrant a judgment: on filing declarations, copies thereof are served on the defendants, or their attornies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and by an <HI>order</HI> of all the judges, 12 <HI>W.</HI> 3. upon delivery or tender of a copy of any declaration, the defendant's attorney shall pay for it after the rate of 4<HI>d. per</HI> sheet, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and if any person refuse to pay for the copy tender'd, the said copy is to be left in the office with the clerk that keeps the files of declarations, and thereupon the plaintiff's attorney giving rules to plead, may for want of a plea sign judgment; and before any plea shall be received, the defen∣dant's attorney is to pay for the copy of the declaration.</P>
<P>If the attorney for the plaintiff does not draw up and deliver a copy of the declaration to the defendant or his attorney, or file the same with the clerk of the declarations, before the end of the next term after the writ is returnable, the plaintiff may be <HI>non-pross'd,</HI> and the defendant shall have costs. So it is where one comes upon an <HI>habeas corpus,</HI> and bail is given thereon; if the plaintiff doth not declare against him within two terms, including the term the defendant was brought in, the action and the bail are to be dis∣charged, and the plaintiff <HI>non-pross'd</HI> with costs. But if a defendant appears in court in person, at the return of the writ, and it be so
<PB N="18" REF="010935_0012_0F852D489E7C13C0"/>
mentioned in the bail-piece, the plaintiff must declare within three days, or a <HI>non-pross</HI> may be entered against him with costs, by the stat. 8 <HI>Eliz. cap.</HI> 2.</P>
<P>It is <HI>ordered,</HI> that where special or common bail is filed, and no∣tice thereof given, a copy of the declaration shall be delivered to the attorney for the defendant, who is to pay for the same, or on refusal, or not knowing where he lives, it may be lest in the office, and notice of it must be forthwith given to the defendant; and such declaration shall be held well delivered from the time of such notice only: and where the cause of action is specially expressed in any writ, by virtue of which the defendant is arrested, and the plaintiff having declared; the defendant shall plead within the usual time, without imparlance, as by original. And if the de∣fendant lives within 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> miles of <HI>London,</HI> the declaration shall be delivered with notice to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in four days after the delivery there∣of; and if he lives above 20 miles off, the declaration is to be de∣livered with notice to plead in eight days after delivery; and on de∣fault of pleading in those times, the plaintiff may sign his judg∣ment. <HI>Ord.

<P>Where the copy of the process is served upon any defendant, and the plaintiff's attorney enters an appearance for him, pursuant to the late act of parliament, a copy of the declaration shall be left in the office, and an <HI>English</HI> notice delivered the defendant, signifying the nature of the action, and in whose office the declaration is left, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that unless the defendant plead within four days, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Judg∣ment will be entered against such defendant by default: and if the defendant does not plead by the time the rules for pleading are out, the plaintiff shall sign judgment, without any further calling for a plea; and thereon notice may be given of executing a writ of in∣quiry, by delivering it to the defendant, or leaving the same at his last or usual place of abode. <HI>Ord.

sum of twenty pounds, or any part thereof, in manner and form as the said</HI> A. <HI>above complains against him: and of this he puts himself upon his country,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>All <HI>pleadings</HI> are either general or spe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> a general plea is drawn on a little piece of 3<HI>d.</HI> stamp'd paper, having only the defendant's attorney's name to it, thus: In debt, <HI>He owes nothing;</HI> or if by bond, <HI>'Tis not his deed, &amp;c.</HI> In case, <HI>He hath not promised:</HI> In tres∣pass, <HI>Not guilty,</HI> &amp;c. And special pleas are drawn up in form, set∣ting forth the matter pleaded at large, with a proper conclusion to the declaration or action; and must be signed by counsel; they are of two sorts, pleas in abatement, and in bar. A plea in abatement begins, <HI>That the defendant ought not to answer the bill,</HI> &amp;c. And <HI>it</HI> concludes in this form: <HI>Whereupon he prays judgment of the bill, or declaration aforesaid,</HI> &amp;c. The plea in bar begins; <HI>That the plaintiff ought not to have or maintain his action:</HI> And concludes to the action, viz. <HI>He prays judgment if he ought to have or maintain his action a∣gainst him,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>When a defendant hath pleaded, the plaintiff answers the de∣fendant's plea, which is called a <HI>replication:</HI> This must contain certainty, and not vary from the declaration, but must pursue and maintain the cause of the plaintiff's action; otherwise it will be a departure in pleading. The defendant answers the plaintiff's repli∣cation by <HI>rejoinder;</HI> and it ought to be a sufficient answer thereto, and enfore the matter of the bar pleaded; if he departs from the plea, the rejoinder is not good. The plaintiff may answer the re∣joinder by a <HI>surrejoinder;</HI> also sometimes, though seldom, plead∣ings come to <HI>rebutter</HI> in answer to the surrejoinder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> A faulty plea in bar, in some cases is made good by a replication; and the replication may be allowed good by a rejoinder; but not where they want substance. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 304.</P>
<P>After all the above pleadings, there may be a <HI>demurrer</HI> in law: And where the defendant has pleaded in abatement, before he pleads directly in bar, he may demur to the plaintiff's declaration; and refer the points of law that arise thereupon to the judgment of the court, which determines all questions arising on such demurrers. A demurrer is to be signed, and argued on both sides by counsel; and when it is joined the plaintiff enters it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and paper books are delivered to the judges: And on a general demurrer, the party confesseth all matters of fact, that are well pleaded. These de∣murrers alledge insufficiency in law in the other party's declaration, plea, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and if special, say, <HI>That it ought not to be answered, be∣cause,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and therefore prays judgment:</HI> And if the matter be found insufficient, judgment is against him that joined in the de∣murrer;
<PB N="21" REF="010935_0013_0F852D48DC5F36D0"/>
but if it appear sufficient, judgment is given against the demurrant. Where the points on a demurrer are apparent and easy to determine, the court will proceed to give judgment upon it presently; but if it be doubtful or difficult, they will take time to consider thereof, and give a day to the parties: And sometimes all the judges of <HI>England</HI> are consulted.</P>
<P>By statute, no dilatory plea shall be received in any court of re∣cord, unless the truth of it be proved by affidavit, or probable matter is shewn: And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he causes of demurrer are to be specially set down, or the judges shall give judgment without regarding im∣perfections in any writ, pleading, &amp;c. so as sufficient matter ap∣pears. <HI>Stat.</HI> 4 <HI>Ann. c.</HI> 16.</P>

An action of account may be brought against a factor, who sells goods and merchandizes; and if a man have a servant, whom he orders to receive money, the master shall have account against him, if he were his receiver: but an apprentice is not chargeable in action of account. <HI>Co.

<P>Where a person receives money due to me upon a bond or obli∣gation; or for rents owing to me, I may have account against him as my receiver; or action of debt, or on the case, as owing me so much money that he hath received.

<P><HI>Action of covenant</HI> is brought where a man is bound by covenant in a deed, entered into by two or more persons to do, or not to do some act or thing agreed betwixt them, when he hath broke the same: and is divided into,
<LIST>

<ITEM>2. Covenant real concerning lands.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. A covenant between persons must be to do what is lawful and possible, or it will not be binding: and in such case where there is any agreement under hand and seal, action of covenant may be brought on it; and if one is party to a deed, his agreement to pay amounts to a covenant. 2 <HI>Mod.</HI> 91.</P>
<P>Upon a bond action of covenant lies, it proving an agreement; and if a person covenants to pay another a certain sum of money at a day, tho' he may bring action of debt for it, yet may writ of covenant be had at his election: but when only a hand is to a writ∣ing, and not a seal, covenant lieth not, but action of the case upon breach of the agreement.

<P>If a man covenant with one to pay him money on a time to come, and do not say to his executors, &amp;c. If the covenantee die before the day, his executors or administrators shall have action of covenant for the money, and recover the same: also in every case where a testator is bound by a covenant, the executor shall be lia∣ble, if it be not determined by the testator's death. Not only par∣ties to deeds, but their executors and administrators, may take ad∣vantage of covenants: but there may be an agreement and cove∣nant, only to be performed by the parties themselves. <HI>Dy.</HI> 12. 5 <HI>Rep.</HI> 16. <HI>Cro.

<P>In deeds and articles of covenant, sometimes a clause for per∣formance, with a penalty, is inserted; and other times, and more frequently bonds are given for the performance, with a sufficient pe∣nalty, separate from the deed; which last being sued, the jury must find the penalty, but on covenant the damages only. And commonly the party damnified in this action shall recover nothing but damages for the breach; except in real actions. <HI>F. N. B.</HI> 145.</P>
<P N="2">2. Where it is agreed, that one man shall pay 100<HI>l.</HI> to another for lands in such a place, this is a mutual real covenant; and acti∣on of covenant lies, if the other party refuses to convey, &amp;c. And when covenants are distinct and mutual, several actions may be brought against parties; but if there be mutual covenants, and the one not to be performed before a covenant precedent, there the

<P>A person covenants expresly to repair a house, and it is burnt down by lightning, or any other accident, yet he ought to repair it, or action of covenant lies against him; for it was in his power to have guarded against it by his contract, by exception, &amp;c. tho' a tenant is not so bound, by covenant in law. But where the use of a thing is demised, and it runs to decay, so that the lessee or te∣nant cannot have the benefit of it; for this no action of covenant lieth for the lessee: and if the lease, &amp;c. is not good, there can be no covenant, or any breach. <HI>Lil.

<P>If a man makes a lease of lands for years, and then turns out the lessee, he shall have covenant against the lessor, tho' there be no express covenant in the deed: but in case a stranger enters be∣fore such lessee, the lessee shall not have an action of covenant upon the ouster, because he was never a lessee in privity to have the action; yet a stranger to the deed may not take advantage of a covenant. <HI>Yelv.</HI> 18.</P>
<P>A covenant for the lessee to enjoy against all men, extends not to tortious acts and entries, &amp;c. for which the lessee hath his pro∣per remedy against the aggressors. If a person covenants in a deed, that he hath good right to grant, &amp;c. and he hath no right, it is breach of covenant, for which action of covenant lieth: and where a man by his own act disables himself to perform a covenant, it is a breach thereof; and no duty or cause of action arises upon any covenant, till it be broken. <HI>Vaugh.</HI> 123. 5 <HI>Rep.</HI> 21. 2 <HI>Bulst.</HI> 12.</P>

<P>The thing detained must be once in the possession of the de∣fendant; which is not to be altered by act of law, as seizure in ex∣ecution, &amp;c. and the nature of the thing must continue without alteration, to intitle this action; so that if leather be made into shoes, or timber be used in building, &amp;c. the writ of detinue will not lie. In case of delivery of goods, if a person to whom a thing is delivered dieth, detinue may be brought against his executors, or against any person to whom the same comes; as if things be de∣livered to be kept, whether by the party, or his father, ancestor, &amp;c. he may bring this action, if detained. 11 <HI>Rep.</HI> 89. 4. <HI>Rep.</HI> 83.</P>

<P>A general action of detinue lies against one that finds a man's goods; though if I deliver any thing to a person, to re-deliver to me, and he loses it, if another finds the thing, and delivers it to one who has right to the same, he is not chargeable to me in deti∣nue: but where any goods are delivered to a man, and he delivers them to another, action of detinue may be had against the second person; and if he deliver the goods to a party having right there∣to, yet 'tis said he is answerable. 9 <HI>H.</HI> 6. 58. 2 <HI>Danv.

<P><HI>Action of trover</HI> and conversion is a special action of the case, lying where a man having found goods refuseth to deliver them to the owner upon demand.

<P>An action of trover, or detinue may be brought for goods de∣tained; for the party shall have his goods detained, if they may be had, or damages to the value for the detaining and conversion of them: after the goods are demanded, if the person having them denies the delivery thereof, detinue or this action lies; and a de∣nial to deliver is a conversion in law: also trespass or trover lies for the same thing; and the alledging the conversion of the goods in trespass, is to aggravate damages.

<P>The action of trover and conversion lieth for goods, altho' they come into the possession of the plaintiff before the action brought, which doth not satisfy for the detainer, or purge the wrong: in case a person takes the horse of another, and rides him, and then delivers the same to the party, he may notwithstanding have tro∣ver, it being a conversion, and re-delivery is no bar: but where a defendant generally tenders the goods, if the plaintiff refuse to receive them, that will go in mitigation of damages; though the plaintiff may bring trover still. <HI>Danv.

<P>If a man finds goods, he ought not to abuse or use them, for therein lies the offence, to found this action, the point of which is the conversion; in this case, the party finding is to deliver them on demand, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> though he may answer, that he knows not whe∣ther the plaintiff is the true owner.

<P><HI>Action of slander</HI> lieth for defaming a person in his reputation; being no more than an action on the case for words, &amp;c. And when words spoken affect a man's life, or liberty, office, trade, or tend to loss of preferment in marriage, service, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or to his dis∣inheritance, or which occasion any particular damage, this action may be brought. There are several divisions of actions of slander as follow:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. For charging a man with particular crimes.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Slander of persons in their offices and professions.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Slandering a man's title to an estate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Of defamation by libels.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. Where any words are maliciously spoken of another, for which, if true, they would touch his life, or he might be punish∣ed, action of slander lies; as to call a man traitor, robber, felon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or charge him with the committing any of these crimes; or to say of one, if he might have his will, he would do such a thing, which thing is actionable. 10 <HI>Rep.</HI> 130. <HI>Dy.</HI> 19.</P>
<P>To reproach a person with a henious crime, as that he lay in wait to rob or murder any one; to charge a man with a rape, that he did ravish or was guilty of ravishing a certain woman; or say he should have been hanged for a rape, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and charging one with so∣domy or buggery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> being very penal by the law, for these acti∣on lieth. The charging a person with stealing things, or as a re∣ceiver of stolen goods, are actionable; tho' the words must import a certain charge of felony, and not be of cutting and taking away standing corn, apples from trees, &amp;c. This action of slander may be had for calling a person a thief; unless something of qualifica∣tion be coupled to prove the thing no felony: and for conspiring to indict a man falsly and maliciously of felony, or other offence, on his acquittal, &amp;c. but not if it appears on the trial there was pro∣bable cause for the indictment. <HI>Rep.</HI> 589. <HI>Bulst.</HI> 112.</P>
<P>For saying of another, that he hath killed, or concealed the murder of a such a man, action lies; but the defendant may shew that the party is or was alive at the speaking of the words, and then no action will lie thereon. To say of one formerly that he
<PB N="41" REF="010935_0023_0F852D50C3A336A0"/>
was a witch, and did bewitch a certain person, &amp;c. was action∣able; tho' not for calling a woman witch, without more words importing that she had bewitched some body, or his goods, &amp;c. For saying one is a pirate, or maintainer of pirates, action of slan∣der lieth; and so it is to say of a man, that he did burn a dwelling-house, or a barn with corn, &amp;c. <HI>Dy.</HI> 236. <HI>Brownl.</HI> 15. 2 <HI>Bulst.</HI> 134. <HI>Yelv.</HI> 154.</P>
<P>Such words as charge a person with forgery of false deeds, or with perjury, bribery, extortion, maintenance, &amp;c. all which are punishable by the common and statute laws, and affect a man's li∣berty and estate; for these words an action of slander may be bro't. If one say of a person, that he could prove him perjured in a court of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cord; or call him perjur'd knave, action lies; so where a man says he gave another money for forswearing himself; and when the words charge the party with subornation of perjury. <HI>Brownl.</HI> 18. 3 <HI>Inst.</HI> 163. <HI>Danv. Abr.</HI> 87.</P>
<P N="2">2. To say of a member of parliament, or a bishop, &amp;c. that he is a papist, is actionable: and for saying a parson preaches lies in the pulpit, action of slander lieth; not if words are, he is a preacher of false doctrine. If one call a justice of peace false justice, &amp;c. A doctor of physick fool, ass, empirick and mountebank; or say that a counsellor is no lawyer; call an attorney rogue and knave in his profession; or to say of him that he is not fit to be an attorney; and calling a clerk in court a corrupt man, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in these cases action lies. 2 <HI>Brownl.</HI> 166. <HI>Danv. Abr.</HI> 119, 113. 4 <HI>Rep.</HI> 15.</P>
<P>An action of slander will lie for words spoke against a sheriff, receiver, steward of a court, mayor, constable, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but the words spoken must relate to the office, and the person be an officer at that time. For saying of a merchant or tradesman, that he is a beggarly fellow, and not able to pay his debts; or to call him bankrupt, or say he will be a bankrupt shortly; and saying of any other, that he is a runaway, and dares not shew his face: that a man is a cheat∣ing knave in his trade; or that he keeps a false book in his shop, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whereby he is injured, action lies. But words of heat, as where a person in passion calls another rogue, knave, or villain, un∣less he apply the words, by saying villain to such man, or knave in such an affair. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> will bear no action. 10 <HI>Rep.</HI> 61. <HI>Danv. Abr.</HI> 114. <HI>Hob.</HI> 93 <HI>T. Raym.</HI> 184.</P>
<P>If one say, that an alehouse-keeper keeps a bawdy-house, action lieth; but to say an inn-keeper harbours rogues, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is not action∣able, for his house is common to all guests. For calling a man▪ whore-master, or a woman whore, except in <HI>London</HI> by the custom of the city, no action lieth: tho' to say of a man that he is a com∣mon whore-master, and lay with a certain woman, and is a drunken
<PB N="42" REF="010935_0024_0F852D53D6A9ECF8"/>
fellow, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Or that a woman hath a bastard, or is with child, and lay with such a man, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whereby either of them lose their mar∣riage, are actionable; but not without special damage on action at common law. <HI>Cro. Eliz.</HI> 582. 2 <HI>Rol. Rep.</HI> 136. 4 <HI>Rep.</HI> 16. 2 <HI>Salk.</HI> 696. 2 Lord <HI>Raym.</HI> 959.</P>
<P>Where a man is courting a woman, if another say of him, that he hath the <HI>French</HI> disease, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or for saying of a person, he hath the pox, leprosy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by reason of which he ought by law to be separated from society, action of slander lies: but 'tis otherwise if the words are that he had the pox, after cured. The saying of one who stands for a place, that he is an ignorant man, and not qua∣lified; or of a parson, that he is an excommunicate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> if there∣by he loseth his preferment, and the servant his service, 'tis acti∣onable. <HI>Cro. Jac.</HI> 430. <HI>Danv. Abr.</HI> 87, 103. <HI>Lev.</HI> 248.</P>
<P N="3">3. Slandering the title of another person is actionable; as to say he has no right to such a house or lands, or that he hath no good estate therein, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> when he is about to sell or let the same, and by this slander the chapman falls off. And for calling a man bastard, that is heir to an estate, action lieth; tho' he be not about to sell it, and he have no particular loss by speaking the words, for there∣by the title of the land may be drawn into question: but 'tis said, if he be an heir apparent, the action lies not till he is disinherited or prejudiced by it; and if he who spoke the words claim the estate as next heir, the action will not lie, which may be set forth by way of bar. <HI>Rep.</HI> 77. 4 <HI>Rep.</HI> 18. <HI>Danv. Abr.</HI> 83.</P>
<P>As to slander of persons, tho' scandalous words are spoken before a man's face, or behind his back, by way of affirmation, or report, in jest or earnest, when sober or drunk, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they are actionable; and so it is if the words are spoke directly or indirectly, or obliquely; and tho' they are pronounced in any language, if understood: but where they can have a double interpretation, they shall be taken in the mildest sense, that no action shall lie. 4 <HI>Rep.</HI> 14. <HI>Hob.</HI> 236. <HI>Cro. Jac.</HI> 438.</P>
<P>If one say that another said a third person did a certain scandalous thing, such third person may have his action of slander against the first man, with an averment that the second never said so, whereby the first is the author of the scandal. In case the slander proceeds from a man's wife, the husband and wife must be sued for it, and not she alone; and for any scandal against the wife, he and she are to bring the action; but for words against both a man and his wife, the husband may prosecute one action for his slander, and he and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e wife may afterwards sue another action for hers. <HI>Cro. Jac.</HI> 406. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</P>
<P>When th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are utterly incertain, no <HI>innuendo</HI> or averment
<PB N="43" REF="010935_0024_0F852D53D6A9ECF8"/>
can make them good; and to these actions the defendant may plead the general issue, Not guilty; or if the plaintiff declares on some of the words only, when all together are not actionable, he may set them forth at large as he spoke them, and traverse or justify the whole <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Also if the defendant can make proof of the words, he may plead special justification; but if the plea be not made good, da∣mages will be aggravated. <HI>Styles</HI> 70. <HI>T. Raym.</HI> 61. <HI>Co. Ent.</HI> 26.</P>
<P N="4">4. Defamation by libel, as by scandalous writing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is like∣wise actionable; and printing or writing may be libellous, if the scandal is not charged in direct terms, but ironically, or tho' there be only the first and last letter of the name, if the jury will find it to point at a particular person: and the person who is the author or contriver, and the procurer, and publisher of a libel, knowing it to be such, are all punishable; as are booksellers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who sell li∣bels, altho' they know not the contents thereof. 5 <HI>Rep.</HI> 125. <HI>Moor</HI> 862. 5 <HI>Mod.</HI> 167.</P>
<P>And a libeller shall be punished, though the party of whom the words be spoken is dead; and notwithstanding the matter of the libel is true, for it is not material whether it be true or false, if the prose∣cution be by way of indictment or information; but in an action of the case, one may justify that it is true. <HI>Hob.</HI> 253. <HI>Hardr.</HI> 470.</P>
<P>But scandalous matter in legal proceedings, alledged in a court of justice, amounts not to any libel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Action of assault and battery</HI> is an action for a trespass against a man's person, where any injury is done to another in a violent manner; as by striking or beating of a man, pushing, jolting, filliping upon the nose, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and as in indictment for this offence
<PB N="46" REF="010935_0026_0F852D55993195C0"/>
for a breach of the peace, the party shall be fined; so on an action he shall render damages. <HI>Dalt.</HI> 282.</P>
<P>If a man in anger lift up or stretch forth his arm, and offer to strike or menace another; or hold up any weapon to strike at him, being within his reach; or shall thrust or push a person; cast a stone at him, tho' he be not struck therewith; throw wine in an∣other's face, or upon his clothes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> These are trespasses and as∣saults in law, for which action lies: and if one threaten to beat or do me some bodily mischief, or lieth in wait to do it; if I dare not follow my business as at other times, and I have any loss thereby, I may have this action. <HI>Bro. Tresp.</HI> 236. <HI>Finch</HI> 29. 18 <HI>Ed.</HI> 4. 28.</P>
<P>To hold a person by the arm is an assault, if not battery; and to strike one, al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho' he is not hurt with the blow; and striking at him, if he be neither hit nor hurt, have been held an assault: for it does not always imply a hitting or blow, because in trespass for as∣sault and battery, a defendant may be found guilty of the assault, and excused of the battery. But if any one strike at another, at a great distance; or if it be near, or he throw stones at him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> merrily or accidentally, and not purposely, no action will lie. 22 <HI>Ass.</HI> 60. <HI>Finch</HI> 40.</P>
<P>It is said the least touching of another in anger is a battery; and tho' battery may not be committed by attempting to beat, but ge∣nerally a stroke must be actually given; yet if one comes to the assistance of another who is beating a third person, tho' he do not touch him, he is guilty of battery; and he who commands or pro∣cures a battery to be done, may be charged as a principal in this action. And spitting in a man's face, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is battery, if not done by accident. <HI>Hob.</HI> 176. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 57. 6 <HI>Mod.</HI> 149, 172.</P>
<P>If two or more persons meet in a narrow passage, and without any violence or design of harm, the one touches the other gently, it will be no battery: though if any of them use violence to force his way in a rude manner, or any struggle is made about the pas∣sage to that degree as to do hurt; it will be a battery, for which action of assault and battery lieth. 6 <HI>Mod.</HI> 149.</P>
<P>To lay hands gently on another, not in anger, is no battery to found an action; the law will not presume any damage: and in this case the defendant may justify <HI>molliter manus imposuit.</HI> Also a man may justify an assault, in defence of his person or goods; or of his wife, father, mother, master, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and for the maintenance of justice: and when a person is beaten by another, he may re∣turn it, and plead that the other's battery was occasioned by his own assault. <HI>Cro. Eliz.</HI> 77<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>Kel.</HI> 64. 2 <HI>Inst.</HI> 316.</P>
<P>A man and his wife may have this action together, for any the least beating of the wife; in case it be such a battery, as thereby he
<PB N="47" REF="010935_0026_0F852D55993195C0"/>
loses her company or service, he alone may bring it: and actions for loss and injury done to the husband, in depriving him of the conversation and service of his wife, are generally laid for assault∣ing and detaining the wife, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whereupon large damages are given. 3 <HI>Rep.</HI> 113. 10 <HI>Rep.</HI> 130. <HI>Cro.

<P>For the assault and battery of a man's wife, child or servant, the husband, father and master shall have action of trespass: but a hus∣band himself may by law moderately correct his wife; a master his servant or apprentice, a schoolmaster his scholar, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and it will not be battery. 2 <HI>Rol.

<P><HI>Action of trespass</HI> lies generally for any wrong or damage, which is done with force and arms by one private man to another; sometimes against the person of a man, and sometimes against his goods and lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And I shall here divide this action into,

<P><HI>Action of ejectment</HI> is brought to recover possession of lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> illegally kept from the right owner: and it partakes of the nature both of a real and personal action; for the land and damages are recovered thereon.</P>
<P>And this action lieth where one makes a lease to another for a term of years, and a third ousts the lessee, then such lessee shall bring ejectment against the person that ousted him, and recover his term and damages: also ejectment may be brought by a lessor against the lessee holding over his term; or on non-payment of rent, &amp;c. But this is now become the common action for trial of
<PB N="51" REF="010935_0028_0F852D572DE87100"/>
titles to lands; yet where entry is taken away by descent, fine, disseisin, &amp;c. ejectment must not lie, so that all titles cannot be tried by it. <HI>Reg. Orig.</HI> 227. <HI>F. N. B.</HI> 220.</P>
<P>Ejectment must be broought for a thing that is certain: as of the manor of <HI>A.</HI> and so many messuages, cottages, acres of arable land, meadow, &amp;c. with the appurtenances, in the parish of, &amp;c. for the nature of the land must be set forth, and be distinguished how much of one sort and how much of another. If a person brings ejectment of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>word acre of land, in two parishes, and the whole is in one, he shall recover; so where ejectment is of an acre of land in <HI>A.</HI> and part of it lieth in <HI>B.</HI> he may recover for such part as lies in <HI>A.</HI> And if a man hath title to a fourth part only, and he bring his action for the whole, he shall recover his fourth part of his lands. <HI>Cro.

<P>In this Action no arrest is to be made, as commonly prosecuted; only a declaration in ejectment, &amp;c. And if it appears that the plaintiff was ejected after the lease made, it is sufficient, tho' no certain day be alledged in which it was done; the day is not ma∣terial, being before the Action brought: but the time of entry of plaintiff must be shewn, that it may appear he was not a diss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isor, by entering on the lands before the commencement of his term, &amp;c. Also where lands in the lease or other deed differ from those in the declaration, and are not exactly the fame; or the term is different, altho' one hath a verdict in ejectment, he cannot have judgment. <HI>Cro. Jac.</HI> 311. 2 <HI>Lutw.</HI> 963.</P>
<P>The action of ejectment is now made short and easy; for there is no occasion for a lease to be made and delivered upon the pre∣mises to the lessee, and ouster and ejectment of him as formerly, unless there be no tenants in possession, &amp;c. but instead of the old way of sealing a lease on the premises, the course is to draw a de∣claration, feigning a lease for years to him that would try the title, and a casual ejector or defendant, who is generally some friend of the plaintiff's; the declaration is delivered to the ejector named, and he serves a copy of it on the tenant in possession, or his wife, and give notice at the bottom for him to appear and defend his title, or that he the feigned defendant will suffer judgment by de∣fault; whereby the true tenant will be turned out of possession: to this declaration, the tenant appears by attorney, and consents to a rule to be made defendant, in the place of the asual ejector, and to confess lease, entry and ouster, and at the trial stand upon the title only; and then the new defendant is put into the declaration, and his attorney pleads not guilty; whereupon the cause proceeds to issue, &amp;c. But if the tenant doth not appear in due time, and enter into such rule, on affidavit of service of the declaration, the
<PB N="52" REF="010935_0029_0F852D57F9199590"/>
court will order judgment to he enter'd against the casual ejector, and the tenant is thereby ousted of his possession. 1 <HI>Lil. Abr.</HI> 498, 499. 1 <HI>Danv.</HI> 665.</P>
<P>A plaintiff in this action recovers according to the right which he hath at the time of bringing the action; and one that hath title to the land in question, may on motion be made a defendant with the tenant in possession, to defend his title: and the landlord may be made defendant by the tenant, with consent of such landlord. For as the possession of the land is primarily in question, and to be recovered, that concerns the tenant; and the title of the land, which is tried collaterally, is concerning some other, who may be admitted a defendant with such tenant: though none other shall be admitted, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat hath been in possession, or receives the rents of the lands. <HI>Nels.

<P>Where there is a recovery by verdict in ejectment, action may be brought for the mesne profits of the land from the time of the defendant's entry, laid in the declaration: and if there be a judg∣ment against the plaintiff, he may bring another action of trespass and ejectment for the lands, it being only to recover the possession, &amp;c. wherein judgment is not final; and 'tis not like a writ of right, where the title alone is tried. <HI>Trin.</HI> 23 <HI>Car.

<P>Tenants to whom declarations in ejectment are delivered by strangers, for any lands, &amp;c. are to give their landlords notice thereof on pain of forfeiting three years rent, to be recovered by action of debt; and the court shall suffer the landlord to make himself defendant with the tenant, if he appears; but if not, judgment shall be signed against the casual ejector, for want of such appearance. Though in case the landlord desires to appear by himself, and consents to enter into the like rule, that the tenant, if he had appeared ought to have done; the court may permit it, and stay execution 'till further order, &amp;c.

<P>And it is ordained, that tenants of lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> fraudulently car∣rying away their goods, to prevent distress for rent; the landlords in thirty days after may distrain them wherever they are, as if upon the premises; and such tenants, and other persons assisting in the fraud, shall forfeit double the value of the goods, recover∣able by action of debt, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And where the goods are under 50 <HI>l.</HI> value, two justices of peace may examine into it, and order such of∣fenders to pay the forfeiture, leviable on their goods and chattles, or for default, to be committed to the house of correction for six months. 11 <HI>Geo.</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 19.</P>
<P>Order made by two justices, reciting that a complaint had been made to them in writing, by <HI>A. Clavey</HI> against <HI>J. Bissex,</HI> that he the said <HI>Clavey</HI> demised his estate in the parish of <HI>Shelly,</HI> in the county of <HI>Somerset,</HI> to <HI>Willam Thatcher,</HI> at the yearly rent of 44 <HI>l.</HI> and that there was due and in arrear from <HI>Thatcher</HI> to him for rent of the said estate, on the 5th day of <HI>April</HI> last, 24 <HI>l.</HI> 15 <HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d.</HI> ½; and that he the said <HI>Clavey</HI> would have distrained the goods and chat∣tles of the said <HI>W. Thatcher</HI> upon the said estate in order to obtain satisfaction of the said rent; but to prevent him from so doing, the said <HI>Bissex,</HI> on or about the 27th, 28th, and 29th days of <HI>Au∣gust</HI> last, did knowingly and wilfully aid and assist the said <HI>Thatcher</HI> in fraudulently conveying and carrying off from the said estate his the said <HI>Thatcher'</HI>s goods and chattles, and also in concealing the same, being under the value of 50 <HI>l.</HI> that is to say, two cows, one heifer, ten hundred weight of cheese, of the value of 20 <HI>l.</HI> where∣by the said <HI>Clavey</HI> was prevented from distraining the same, in or∣der to obtain satisfaction for the said rent, and contrary to the sta∣tute 11 <HI>Geo.</HI> 2. and therefore praying us to grant him our warrant of summons, requiring you the said <HI>J. Bissex</HI> to appear before us, and that we would examine the facts, and thereupon make such order therein for his relief, as the said statute directs and requires, and as should be agreeable to justice: whereupon we the said jus∣tices, residing near the said estate from whence the said goods and cattle were removed, and neither of us any way interested in the said estate, did issue our warrant of summons, requiring you the said <HI>J. Bissex</HI> to attend us thereon to answer the said complaint; and you having attended accordingly, and we in your presence having
<PB N="65" REF="010935_0035_0F852D5F74FB0CA0"/>
examined the witnesses produced by the said <HI>A. Clavey</HI> upon oath' and heard what was alledged by you in your defence, do adjudge that the said complaint is true; and that the said goods and cattle of the said <HI>W. Thatcher,</HI> in which you so aided and assisted in conveying and carrying off from the said estate, and also in con∣cealing the same, were of the value of 20 <HI>l.</HI> and that you have thereby forfeited double of the value of the said goods and cattle, being the sum of 40 <HI>l.</HI> to the said complainant <HI>A. Clavey,</HI> by vir∣tue of the statute: we therefore in pursuance of the said statute, do adjudge, order, and require you the said <HI>J. Bissex</HI> within the space of three days from the date hereof, to pay to the said <HI>A. Clavey</HI> the sum of 40 <HI>l.</HI> which if you shall neglect to do, such further pro∣ceedings will be then had against you to inforce the payment there∣of, as the said statute directs and requires. Given under our hands and seals this 5th day of <HI>January</HI> 1756. This order was affirm∣ed by the sessions upon appeal. Both the orders were removed by <HI>certiorari</HI> into the King's Bench. It was moved to quash the same. Objections taken: 1. The complaint is said to be taken in wri∣ting, but not upon oath. 2. It is only said, that he demised to <HI>W. Thatcher;</HI> but not said for what estate or term. 3. It is stated, so much due for rent, but not said for what term: it might be due twenty years ago. It is not stated to be due when <HI>Thatcher</HI> moved the goods. 4. The words of the order are, goods and <HI>cattle;</HI> of the statute goods and <HI>chattels.</HI> 5. No certain time is alledged when the defendant aided and assisted; only said on or about the 26th, 27th, or 28th of <HI>August.</HI> 6, Not stated that <HI>Thatcher</HI> did carry off his goods: only that <HI>Bissex</HI> did aid and assist him in carry∣ing them off. 7. They adjudge the complaint true, but do not state the evidence, and this is a conviction, not an order: and for any thing that appears, it might be upon <HI>Clavey'</HI>s evidence a∣lone. 8. It is not stated that the goods were under the value of 50 <HI>l.</HI> which is the ground of the justices jurisdiction. 9. The words of the statute are, if any person shall be a tenant of any lands, tenements, or hereditaments: the word used in the order is estate, which may be a thing incorporeal, or may mean the in∣terest in the land, and so not within the statute. 10. It shall ap∣pear, whether the landlord has a right to distrain: by 8 <HI>An. c.</HI> 14. the landlord may distrain at any time within six months after the expiration of the term: it doth not appear these six months were not expired, and if they were, this is no offence. After considera∣tion, Mr. Justice <HI>Denison</HI> delivered the resolution of the court: I think the most material objection is, whether this is an order or a conviction. If a conviction, the evidence ought to have been set out. And there has been no doubt (notwithstanding the case of
<PB N="66" REF="010935_0036_0F852D60769ADDD8"/>
<HI>K.</HI> and <HI>Pullein<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Salk.</HI> 369.) that in a conviction the evidence must be set out, that the court may judge upon it. So it was held by Lord <HI>Hardwicke</HI> in the case of <HI>K.</HI> and <HI>Lloyd.</HI> 2 <HI>Stra.</HI> 996. 2 <HI>Barnard K. B.</HI> 302, 310, 338, 466. <HI>Sess. Cas.</HI> 223 <HI>pl.</HI> 190. and in that case it was objected, that as it subjectd the party to a pe∣nalty, though in the statute it was called an order, yet it should be construed as a conviction: but the court said, every act of the justices, which subjects the party to a penalty, shall not be con∣strued as a conviction. <HI>K.</HI> and <HI>Venables. Stra.</HI> 630. 2 Ld. <HI>Raym.</HI> 1406. <HI>Fortesc. Rep.</HI> 325. <HI>Sess. Cas.</HI> 267. <HI>pl.</HI> 210. <HI>Cas. of Set. and Rem.</HI> 163. upon the statute for licensing alehouses, considered as an order. <HI>K.</HI> and <HI>Blackwell. M.</HI> 4 <HI>Geo.</HI> which the court said was a strong case, and must be considered as an order. I understood from my Lord <HI>Hardwicke,</HI> in the case of <HI>K.</HI> and <HI>Lloyd,</HI> that his ground of the difference was founded upon the expressions of the statute, and not upon the penalty; as where the words of the statute are, "of which he shall be convicted," it is to be con∣strued as a conviction. Here it is extremely strong; the statute calls it an order: and in the nature of it, it is an examination upon a complaint. If the party was never summoned, this court upon affidavit will grant information against the justices: but the sum∣mons need not be set out; and the court will intend the justices have done right, in case the contrary does not appear upon the face of the order. As to the first objection: this is not an infor∣mation, but a complaint: when the party is summoned, the wit∣nesses are to be examined upon oath, but the complaint need not be upon oath. In answer to the second objection: as the order has followed the words of the statute, we will not intend it a case wherein the justices had not a jurisdiction. The court will not, in case of an order, intend that the justices have done wrong. As to the third objection: it is sufficiently alledged in an order; his assisting the tenant to carry away the goods, as it is here alledged, is sufficient, the rent continued then to be in arrear; and the rather as the defendant might have availed himself of the rent paid, by proving it before the justices. I much doubt, whether in a decla∣ration it would not be sufficient to say, the rent was in arrear at such a day; and I think it would lie upon the defendant to prove that the rent does not remain in arrear. As to its not being said, for what time the rent was due; this is mere matter of form. As to the fifth objection: <HI>about,</HI> in common parlance, means in this case three days or near it. They might be three days in carrying the goods away. The days are not material, even in legal pro∣ceedings. Ld. <HI>Raym.</HI> 581. and in the case of <HI>K.</HI> and <HI>Simpson, H.</HI> 3 <HI>Geo. Stra.</HI> 46. the day and hour in a conviction are not material.
<PB N="67" REF="010935_0036_0F852D60769ADDD8"/>
By this statute no time is limited, when the complaint shall be made: it may be made at any time. Suppose the defendant had paid the penalty on a different complaint made, he might easily have shewn it. As to the sixth, the answer is obvious; if <HI>Thatcher</HI> had not carried his goods away, the defendant could not have aided in carrying them. The statute makes two offences, one carrying the goods away; the other, aiding in carrying them a∣way. It is only necessary here to state the offence which the de∣fendant had been guilty of, which this order does in the words of the statute. In the case of <HI>K.</HI> and <HI>Monk, M.</HI> 13 <HI>Geo.</HI> 2. there was a conviction for aiding and assisting in killing a buck. It was ob∣jected, that it was not charged the buck was killed. But the court held, that as the conviction was in the words of the statute, it was sufficient; and the court held they were all principals, as well those that killed the buck, as those that assisted. And this was the case of a conviction. All the other objections may have this general answer; that in the case of orders, where the justices have jurisdiction, we will intend they have acted right; and if they have done wrong, they may be punished by an information. Let the orders be confirmed. <HI>Burn. Just.</HI> 4<HI>to.</HI> 304.</P>
<P>Landlords may take and seize goods concealed in any house, or out-house, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and in case of a dwelling house, on oath made before a justice of reason to suspect that the goods are therein, may with the assistance of a constable break open such house to di∣strain. Stat. 11 <HI>Geo.</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 19.</P>
<P>But except it be in this case where the goods are clandestinely conveyed, it may seem from what has been said, that the landlord hath no mean to come at the goods in order to make a distress, if the tenant shall think fit to lock up his gates and shut the doors: which matter may seem to require consideration. <HI>Burn's Justice,</HI> 4<HI>to. pag.</HI> 307.</P>
<P>And any cattle feeding on commons; or corn, grass, or other things growing on the land, shall and may be distrained for rent; and when ripe, cut and cured, a week's notice being given to the tenant where lodged, may be appraised and disposed of towards sa∣tisfaction of the landlord, if the tenant do not before pay the rent and charges. 11 <HI>Geo.</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 19.

<P N="2">2. <HI>Replevin</HI> is grounded upon a distress, and is a re-deliverance of it, that the thing distrained may remain with the first possessor, on surety given by him to try the right with the distrainer, and answer the same at law: and if he do not pursue his action, or it be judged against him, then he that took the distress shall have it again, by the writ <HI>retu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>no habendo.

<P>If notice be not given in writing, on taking a distress, of the things distrained, and for what you distrain them, they may not be sold by the statute 2 <HI>W. &amp; M.</HI> but the distress is to be detained till replevin, or satisfaction: and replevins are by writ at common law; or on plaint by statute, for the party's more speedy having again of his cattle and goods distrained. Here the sheriff ought to take two sorts of pledges, one by the common law, to prose∣cute; and another by the statute, to return the distress, if the taking be judged lawful; and if the sheriff deliver a distress with∣out th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se pledges he must answer the price thereof. <HI>Co.

hundred-court, and court-baron. The most usual method <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o obtain a replevin is by plaint; and the sheriff may take a plaint by statute, and make a replevin presently, and enter it in the county-court afterwards: also sheriffs of counties shall depute four deputies to make replevins, not dwelling above twelve miles di∣stant from one another, under a certain penalty. <HI>Dy.</HI> 246. <HI>Co.

<P>If the defendant in replevin claims the property of the goods, the sheriff cannot proceed till it is decided before him by writ <HI>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> proprietate probanda;</HI> and if found for the plaintiff, the sheriff is to make replevin or deliverance; but if for the defendant he is to do nothing further: though the plaintiff may replevy by writ after∣wards; and if the sheriff returns the property claimed, it shall be put in issue and tried in the Common Pleas. <HI>Finch</HI> 316, 317.</P>
<P>Where cattle or goods are not delivered upon a first replevin, the party distrained may have an <HI>alias,</HI> and a <HI>pluries</HI> replevin, in the general prosecution of it; and if the cattle are put into any strong place, the sheriff may take the <HI>posse comitatus,</HI> and break into it, to make the replevin: when they are driven out of the county, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> so that the sheriff cannot make replevin, a writ of <HI>Withernam</HI> shall go to take so many of the distrainer's cattle, till the party make deliverance of the first distress, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and in this case, the cattle taken shall be to the value of those that were first taken and detained. 52 <HI>H.</HI> 3. <HI>c.</HI> 21. 1 <HI>P.</HI> &amp; <HI>M.</HI> 2 <HI>Inst.</HI> 140. 13 <HI>Ed.</HI> 1.</P>
<P>On bringing a replevin, it must be certain in setting forth the number and kinds of cattle distrained; that the sheriff may know how to make deliverance of the cattle, if a writ be directed to him to do it; and the time and place are to be named in the declarati∣on: if the plaintiff in replevin makes default, or is nonsuit, or judgment be given against him, the defendant may have his writ <HI>retorno habendo</HI> of the goods taken in distress. And when the plaint is removed into <HI>C. B. &amp;c.</HI> and the plaintiff nonsuited, before or after avowry made, the defendant may distrain again for the same cause; but the plaintiff may sue a writ of <HI>second deliverance</HI> upon the same record, to revive the first suit; upon which writ, the sheriff is to take security for the suit, and so make a return of the cattle or price of them, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the return shall be adjudged. <HI>Hob.</HI> 16. <HI>T.

<P>And after this second deliverance and trial thereon; or if the plaintiff be again nonsuit upon a declaration, there must be award∣ed a <HI>returnum irreplegiabile</HI> to the defendant; and then he may make his avowry, or plea in justification of his distress, to ground a writ of inquiry of damages; or hold the beasts till he is satisfied:

in case the defendant make default, the plaintiff shall have judgment to recover all in damages; as well the value of the cattle, as da∣mages for the taking of them, and his costs.

<HEAD>How controversies are determined, without action at law, by award, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AWARD is the judgment and arbitration of one or more persons, at the request of two parties at variance, for end∣ing the matter in dispute, without public authority: and this is done by arbitrators chosen by the parties, on a bond to submit themselves to their judgment.</P>
<P>And arbitrators are generally where parties think it more safe to refer the matters in controversy to the determination of friends, than to venture a trial at law; they proceed at their own discretion, without solemnity of process, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to hear and determine the con∣troversy refered to them: and they have as great power as other judges, though they are not tied to the formalities of law; and if they observe the submission, their award is definitive. <HI>Dy.</HI> 356.</P>
<P>The submission to arbitrators may he general, of all demands, &amp;c. or special, of some matters in dispute: and the award must be made of the thing submitted, according to the submission; it must be equal between the parties, and not on one side only; and the performance of it is to be lawful and possible; also the award must be certain and final: if an award is of things not submitted, or to pay money to a stranger, &amp;c. it will be void. <HI>Co.

<P>Where arbitrators award a thing against law, it is void; so if more is awarded than should be: but on a general submission, the award may be of part, without the residue, and be good. An award may be void for some part, and good in another part, if it makes an end of all the differences submitted; and if the award is good in part, and void in part thereof, the good shall be per∣formed.
<PB N="75" REF="010935_0040_0F852D6315101700"/>

<P>If all debts and demands are submitted to arbitration, the arbi∣trators may award a release of bonds, specialties, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by which the debts and demands are due: and where the award is according to the submission by bond, though it be void in law, if it is not per∣formed, the obligation will be forfeited. Things relating to free∣holds, leases, debts due on certain contract, matters concerning matrimony, and criminal offences, are not arbitrable by awards. <HI>Danv. Abr.</HI> 513, 515.</P>
<P>Sometimes matters are refered by the judges at the assises to the three foremen of the jury,<NOTE PLACE="marg">10 Mod. 332. Stra. 1. 2 Stra. 1024. 9 Mod. 232.</NOTE> in na∣ture of arbitrators; and after their award is made, the plaintiff may have an attachment, &amp;c. to oblige performance: and attachment lies for not perform∣ing an award made a rule of court; after personal demand of per∣formance. <HI>Salk.</HI> 83, 84. Submissions to awards, by agreement of the parties, may be made a rule of any of his majesty's courts of record; and on a rule of court thereupon, the parties shall be fi∣nally concluded by such arbitrament: and in case of disobedience thereto, the party refusing to perform the same shall be subject to the penalties of contemning a rule of court, &amp;c. except it appears on oath, that such award was unduly procured, when it shall be set aside: but this extends only to personal matters, for which there is no other remedy but by personal action, or by suit in equity. <HI>Stat.</HI> 9 <HI>&amp;</HI> 10 <HI>W.</HI> 3. <HI>c.</HI> 15.</P>
<P>When there is but one arbitrator, which happens where the matter is referred to two, and if they cannot agree in the award, it is left to a third person, this is called an <HI>umpirage;</HI> and the um∣pire has the same power as the arbitrators, if they do not agree in their award.

<P N="1">1. The <HI>court of Chancery</HI> is the highest court of judicature in this kingdom next to the parliament, and of very ancient institu∣tion. Its jurisdiction is of two kinds; ordinary or legal; and extraordinary, or absolute: The ordinary court is that wherein the lord chancellor in his proceedings and judgments, observes the order and method of the common law; and in such cases, the proceedings are filed or inrolled in the <HI>Petty-Bag</HI> office.</P>
<P>This court holds plea of recognizances acknowledged in Chan∣cery; writs of <HI>scire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acias</HI> for repeal of letters patent, writs of partition, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and also of all personal actions, by or against any

officer of the court; and by acts of parliament, of several offen∣ces and causes: all original writs, commissions of bankrupts, cha∣ritable uses, of ideots and lunacy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> issue out of this court, for which it is always open; one from hence may have an <HI>habeas corpus,</HI> prohibition, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the vacation, which are to be had out of the other courts only in term-time; and here a <HI>subpoena</HI> may be issued to force witnesses to appear in other courts, when they have no power to call them. But in prosecuting causes, if the par∣ties descend to issue, this court cannot try it by jury; but the re∣cord is to be sent into the King's Bench, and try'd there, and af∣terwards remanded into the Chancery: though if there be a de∣murrer in law, it shall be argued and adjudged here. Upon a judgment given in this court, a writ of error lies returnable in <HI>B. R.</HI> 4 <HI>Inst.</HI> 78, 80, <HI>&amp;c. Danv. Abr.</HI> 776.</P>
<P>The extraordinary or unlimited court exercises jurisdiction in cases of equity, by way of <HI>English</HI> bill and answer in abating the rigour of the common law, and where the courts of law are de∣fective to give remedy: it gives relief for and against infants, not∣withstanding their minority; and for or against married women, called fem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> coverts, notwithstanding their coverture; all frauds and deceits are here relievable, as also all accidents to mortgagors, obligors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> against penalties and forfeitures, where the intention was to pay the debt; all breaches of trust, unreasonable engage∣ments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This court may force unreasonable creditors to com∣pound debts; make executors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> give security, and pay interest for money long in their hands; and here executors may sue one another, or one executor alone be sued without the rest: order may be made for performance of a will; decree made who shall have the tuition of a child; and this court may relieve copyholders against the ill usage of their lords; confirm title to land, where the deeds are lost; make conveyances, defective thro' fraud or mistake, good and perfect; oblige men to come to account with each other; avoid the bar of actions, by the statute of limitations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 4. <HI>Inst.</HI> 84. <HI>Rol.

<P>But in all cases, where the plaintiff can have his remedy at law, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e ought not be relieved in Chancery; and long leases, as for 1000 years; naked promises; verbal agreements not executed: estates derived under concealed titles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> have been refused relief in this court: mortgages are not relievable in equity after twenty years, where no demand has been made: or interest paid, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Also this court will not retain a suit for any thing under 10 <HI>l.</HI> va∣lue, except it be in cases of charity; nor for lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> under 40 <HI>s. per annum;</HI> and it refuses to relieve persons in suits where the substance of them tends to the overthrow of any fundamental

<P>And altho' the power of the court of Chancery, in its equita∣ble proceedings, is so great in the foregoing particulars, yet it is no court of record; and therefore 'tis said can bind the person only, and not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he estate of the defendant; and if the party will not obey the decree of this court, he must be committed until he does: in this case, if there be an order that one shall stand com∣mitted to the <HI>Fleet,</HI> for breach of a decree, in pursuance of the order, there must be a writ awarded for taking and imprisoning him. 4 <HI>Inst.</HI> 84. <HI>Danv.</HI> 749, 776.</P>
<P>It is ordained by the <HI>stat.</HI> 36 <HI>Ed.</HI> 3. That whosoever shall find himself grieved with any statute, he shall have his remedy in the Chancery.

In ancient times this court was ordinarily exercised only in cri∣minal matters, and pleas of the crown: and it awards execution against persons attainted or condemned by parliament, or any other court, when the record is removed, and their persons brought thither by <HI>habeas corpus;</HI> and there pardons of offenders are allow∣ed, on removing the records and prisoners, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This court may bail any person whatsoever; grants <HI>habeas corpus's</HI> to relieve per∣sons wrongfully imprisoned; restores freemen unjustly disfranchi∣sed; and grants prohibitions to keep other courts within their proper jurisdictions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 4 <HI>Inst.</HI> 70. 2 <HI>Danv.

<P>The court of <HI>B. R.</HI> regulates all the courts of law in the king∣dom, so that they do not exceed their jurisdictions, nor alter their forms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and may grant an attachment against any infe∣rior court usurping a jurisdiction not belonging to it; but general∣ly a writ of prohibition is first issued to such court. The judges of this court are the sovereign justices and coroners of the land: and their jurisdiction is general over all <HI>England,</HI> which, when the king hath appointed them, they have from the law. 4 <HI>Inst.</HI> 74.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>court of Common Pleas</HI> is one of the king's courts held in <HI>Westminster-hall,</HI> or other certain place: it is not to follow the king and his court, but to be held at some place certain; nor shall be removed without warning by adjournment. <HI>Stat.</HI> 9 <HI>H.</HI> 3. <HI>c.</HI> 12. <HI>&amp;</HI> 2 <HI>Ed.</HI> 3. <HI>c.</HI> 11.</P>
<P>All actions belonging to this court come here either by original, as on arrests and outlawries; or by privilege or attachment, for or against privileged persons; or out of inferior courts not of record: and all civil causes, real, personal, or mixed, are here brought and determined; tho' regularly this court cannot hold plea in any ac∣tion real or personal, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but by writ out of Chancery, return∣able here; unless it be by bill for or against an officer, or other privileged person of the court. 4 <HI>Inst.</HI> 99, 100.</P>
<P>The Common Pleas is said to have been the only court for real causes concerning lands; and in personal and mixed actions, it hath a concurrent jurisdiction with the King's Bench: but it hath no cognizance of pleas of the crown; and common pleas are all pleas that are not such. It's jurisdiction, like that of the other courts at <HI>Westminster,</HI> is general, and extends throughout <HI>Eng∣land:</HI> and hither suits are removed out of other courts by divers writs; as by <HI>pone, recordare,</HI> writ of false judgment, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 4 <HI>Inst.</HI> 118. <HI>Fortescue</HI> 50, 51.</P>

up to order and determine the rights and revenues, debts and dutie due to the crown, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And in the Exchequer there are diver courts, consisting of many branches; but according to the usual division, it is divided into two parts only, for dispatch of business. 4 <HI>Inst.</HI> 112, 115.</P>
<P>This is the last of the four courts at <HI>Westminster;</HI> and the lord chief baron and barons are the sovereign auditors of <HI>England,</HI> and hear and determine all causes in law or equity: for the judicial part of the Exchequer is a court both of law and equity; the court of law being in the office of Pleas, after the course of the common law, <HI>coram baronibus;</HI> and the court of equity held in the Exchequer-chamber, before the lord treasurer, chancellor or under-treasurer, and barons: but generally before the barons only, the lord chief baron being the chief judge. 4 <HI>Inst.</HI> 118.</P>
<P>Here the proceedings are according to the practice of the Chan∣cery, by bill and answer; but the plaintiff must set forth in his bill, that he is debtor or accountant to the king, though whe∣ther it be so or not, is not material: in this court the clergy usu∣ally exhibit their bills for recovery of tithes; and here the attor∣ney general brings bills against persons for any matters concerning the king; also any person grieved with any prosecution on behalf of the king, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may bring his bill against the attorney general, and be relieved therein. <HI>Ibid.</HI></P>
<P>In the court of law, all the officers, and clerks, the king's te∣nants and farmers, all debtors and accountants of the Exchequer, are privileged to sue and implead one another, or any stranger, in like manner as in the King's Bench and Common Pleas; and the writs of <HI>subpoena,</HI> and <HI>quo minus</HI> go into <HI>Wales,</HI> where no process of the courts of <HI>B.

<P>There is a court of <HI>Exchequer-chamber,</HI> being the assembly of all the judges of <HI>England,</HI> for difficult matters in law; into which causes are adjourned when there are two judges against two, that they cannot be determined in other courts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

Of <HI>nisi prius,</HI> directed to the judges and clerk of assise, by which civil causes grown to issue in the courts above are tried in the vacation by a jury of 12 men of the county where the cause of action arises; and on return of the verdict of the jury to the court above, the judges there give judgment. 5. A commission <HI>of the peace,</HI> in every county of the circuits; and all justices of peace of the county are bound to be present at the assises; and sheriffs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> shall also give their atten∣dance on the judges, or they shall be fined. 4 <HI>Inst.</HI> 158. <HI>Bacon's Elem.</HI> 15, 16, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1. The <HI>County-Court</HI> is a court kept by the sheriff of every county, and divided into two sorts; one retaining the general name, as the county-court held every month, before the sheriff or his deputy: the other called the turn, held twice in every year, <HI>viz.</HI> within a month after <HI>Easter</HI> and <HI>Michaelmas.</HI> Cromp. Jurisd. 241.</P>
<P>By the Common law, every sheriff ought to make his turn or circuit throughout all the hundreds in his county, in order to hold a court in every hundred for the redressing of common grivances, and preservation of the peace, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the turn is the king's leet thro' all the county; it being a court of record, of which the sheriff is judge: also before the courts at <HI>Westminster</HI> were erected, the coun∣ty-courts were the chief courts of the kingdom. <HI>Glanvil, lib.</HI> 1. <HI>cap.</HI> 2, 3. <HI>Fleta, lib.</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 62.</P>

<P N="2">2. The <HI>Court-leet</HI> is a court of record incident to a hundred, or∣dained for punishing offences against the crown; it is derived out of the sheriff's turn, and inquires of all offences under treason; but those, which are to be punished with loss of life or member, are only inquirable and presentable there; and must be certified over to the justices of assise. 4 <HI>Inst.</HI> 261. <HI>Stat.</HI> 1 <HI>Ed.</HI> 3.</P>
<P>And this court is called the <HI>view of frank-pledge,</HI> for that the king is to be there certified by the view of the steward, how many people are within every leet, and have an account of their good manners and government; and all persons above twelve years of age, which have remained there for a year and a day, may be sworn to be faithful to the king, and the people are to be kept in peace, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Also every one, from the age of twelve to sixty years, that dwells within the leet, is obliged to do suit in this court; ex∣cept peers clergymen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 4 <HI>Inst.</HI> 261, 263.</P>
<P>In the court-leet, or view of frank-pledge, formerly all persons were bound with sureties or pledges for their truth to the king: the steward is here the judge, as the sheriff is in the turn; and this court is to be kept twice a year, one time in a month after <HI>Easter,</HI> and the other within a month after <HI>Michaelmas,</HI> at a cer∣tain place within the precinct: and the steward hath power to e∣lect officers, as constables, tithing-men, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as well as punish offenders. The usual method of punishment in the leet is by fine and amercement, and a presentment here subjects the party to them; the former is assessed by the steward, and the latter by the jury; for both of which, the lord may have an action of debt, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake a distress. <HI>Kitch.</HI> 70. <HI>Co.

<P N="3">3. The <HI>Court-Baron</HI> is that court which every lord of a manor, (who in antient times were called barons,) hath within his own precinct: and a court-baron is an inseparable incident to a manor; it must be held by prescription, for it cannot be created at this day, and is to be kept on some part of the manor. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 58. 4 <HI>Inst.</HI> 268.</P>
<P>This court is of two natures, 1. By the Common law, which is the barons or freeholders court, of which the freeholders being suitors are the judges. 2. By custom, which is called the custom∣ary court, and concerns the customary tenants and copyholders, whereof the lord or his steward is judge: the court-baron may be of this double nature, or one may be without the other. The freeholders court hath jurisdiction for trying actions of debt, tres∣pass, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> under 40 <HI>s.</HI> and may be held every three weeks; being something like the county-court: but on recovery in debt, they have not power to make execution, only to distrain the defendant's goods, and retain them till satisfaction is made. The other court-baron, is for taking and passing of estates; surrenders, admittances, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and is kept but once or twice in a year, (usually with the court-leet) unless it be on purpose to grant an estate, and then it may be holden as often as required. 4 <HI>Rep.</HI> 26. 6 <HI>Rep.</HI> 12. 2 <HI>Inst.</HI> 119.</P>
<P>In this court the homage jury are to inquire that the lords do not lose their services, duties, or customs; but that the tenants make their suits of court; pay their rents, heriots, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and keep lands and tenements in repair, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and every public trespass may be pu∣nished here by amercement on presenting the same. <HI>Stat.</HI> 4 <HI>Ed.</HI> 1.</P>

<P N="1">1. Attornies at law are those persons as take upon them the busi∣ness of other men, by whom they are retained: and in respect of
<PB N="85" REF="010935_0045_0F852D67B5065358"/>
the several courts, there are attornies at large; and attornies speci∣al, belonging to this or that court only. <HI>Rol. Abr.</HI> 17.</P>
<P>By order of all the judges, attornies are to be admitted into some of the inns of court of chancery, and take chambers there or near, (except house-keepers in <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster, &amp;c.</HI>) and none shall be sworn an attorney until he is thus admitted: no attorney shall put himself out of the society that he is of, till he is admitted of some other society, and deliver a certificate thereof; all attornies are to be in commons the times ordered by the society to which they belong, and offending therein shall be put out of the roll of attornies. Attachments have been granted against those that have disobeyed this order, in not being admitted of some inn of court, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and attornies may be committed for any ill practices. <HI>Ord. Mich.</HI> 3 <HI>Ann, Lil. Abr.</HI> 129, 130.</P>
<P>Action lies for a client against his attorney, if he appear for him without warrant; and if he pleads a plea, for which he hath not his warrant: but in case the attorney appears without warrant, and judgment is had against his client, the judgment shall stand, if the attorney be responsible; otherwise if the attorney be not re∣sponsible. Action lies against an attorney for suffering judgment against his client by <HI>nil dicit,</HI> when he had given him a warrant to plead the general issue; though this is understood where it is done by covin. Action lies not for what any attorney does generally, although he knows the plaintiff has no cause of action; he only acting as a servant in way of his profession. <HI>Danv. Abr.</HI> 185. 4 <HI>Inst.</HI> 117. <HI>Mod.</HI> 209. <HI>Salk.</HI> 88.</P>
<P>He, that is attorney at one time, is attorney at all times pending the plea: and the plaintiff or defendant may not change his attor∣ney, while the suit is depending, without leave of the court, which would reflect on the credit of attornies; not until the at∣torney's fees are paid; and attornies and solicitors may detain writ∣ings which come to their hands by way of business, till their just fees are satisfied: if there be no fees due, the court will compel the delivery of them on motion, without forcing the party to an action. A cause shall proceed notwithstanding the death of an at∣torney therein, and not be delayed on that account. <HI>Lil. Abr.</HI> 148. 2 <HI>Keb.</HI> 273.</P>

An attorney shall not be allowed any fees laid out for counsel, or otherwise, unless he have tickets thereof signed by them who receive such fees; and attornies shall give in true bills to their clients of all the charges of suits, under their hands, before the clients shall be charged with the payment there∣of; if they delay their clients suits for gain; or demand by their bills more than their due fees and disbursements, the clients shall recover costs and treble damages against them; and they shall be for ever after disabled to be attornies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 3 <HI>Jac. c.</HI> 7. 13 <HI>W.</HI> 3. <HI>c.</HI> 6.</P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>Jury</HI> signifies a certain number of men, sworn to inquire of matter of fact, and declare the truth upon such evidence as shall be delivered them in a cause.

Also besides the common jury in civil cases; there is a <HI>special jury,</HI> in causes of consequence tried at the bar, when the court makes a rule for the secondary to name forty-eight free∣holders, and each party is to strike out twelve, one at a time, and the remainder to be the jury for the trial.

<P>Jurors are not to meddle with any matters which are not in issue; they are finable if unlawfully dealt with to give their verdict; tho' they are not fineable for giving a verdict contrary to the evidence, or against the direction of the court; for the law supposes the jury may have some other evidence than what was given in court; and they may not only find things of their own knowledge, but they go according to their consciences: but in a civil cause, an attaint will lie against them, if they give a false or corrupt verdict. 3 <HI>Leon.</HI> 147. <HI>Vaugh.</HI> 144, 149, 153.</P>
<P>If the jury take upon them the knowledge of the law, and give a general verdict, it is good; but in cases of difficulty they may find the special matter, and leave it to the judges to determine what law is upon the fact. And after the evidence is given, the jury are to be kept together till they bring in their verdict, with∣out meat, drink, fire, or candle, otherwise than with leave of the court; and the court may not give them leave to eat or drink, out of court: if jurors after sworn eat or drink, tho' the verdict be good, they are fineable; and if it be at the charge of either party, the verdict is void. When a juror is sworn, he may not go from the bar until the evidence is given, for any cause whatso∣ever, without leave of the court, and having a keeper with him: and when the jury are gone from the bar, a witness may not be called by them to repeat the same evidence he gave in court. <HI>Co.

<P>In capital cases a verdict must be actually given by jurors; and if the jury do not agree upon it, they may be carried round the cir∣cuits, and shall not be discharged till they do: in civil cases it is otherwise, as where there are nonsuits, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and oftentimes in a civil case, when the evidence hath been heard, the parties doubt∣ing of the verdict do consent that the jury shall be drawn or dis∣charged.

A judge who is to try the person, may give testimony, going off from the bench: and a juror may be a witness, as to his particular knowledge; but then it must be on exmination in open court, not before his bro∣ther jurors. Members of corporations will not be generally ad∣mitted to be witnesses in a cause that concerns the corporation; though inhabitants that are not freemen will be allowed: a coun∣sellor, attorney, or solicitor, is not to be examined as a witness against their clients, being obliged to keep their secrets; but of their own knowledge before retained, not as counsel, attorney, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they may be examined. <HI>Co.

But in criminal cases, as of robbery on the highway, in action against the hundred; in rapes of women, or where a woman is married by force, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> a man or woman may be witness in their own cause; so in private notorious cheats, where no persons else can be witnesses, but those who suffer. 2 <HI>Lil.

Although judgment of the pillory infers infamy at common law; by the civil and canon law it is no infamy, unless the cause for which the person was con∣victed was infamous: and it hath been adjudged, that 'tis not stand∣ing in the pillory, disables a person to give evidence; but the stand∣ing there upon a judgment for some infamous crime, as forgery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> If for a libel, a man may be a witness; and so in other cases, when he is pardoned. 3 <HI>Inst.</HI> 219. 3 <HI>Lev.</HI> 426, 427. 5 <HI>Mod.</HI> 16, 74. 3 <HI>Nels.

1. Trial, in its common definition, is the examination of a cause civil or criminal, before a judge, who has jurisdiction to try it according to the laws of the land. And the most general rule has been, that every trial shall be out of that town, precinct, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with∣in which the matter of fact triable is alledged, or the nearest thereunto, for the better cognizance of the fact committed. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 125.</P>
<P>All trials for murder must be had in the county where the fact was done: but if the stroke is in one county, and the death in ano∣ther, the indictment may be found by the jury of the county where the party died; and there the matter be tried as well as if the stroke had been in the same county: and when an indictment is found against a person in the proper county, it may be heard and determined in any other county by special commission, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In a civil case, if a foreign issue which is local should happen, it may be tried where the action is laid; and for that purpose the plaintiff may enter a suggestion on the roll, that such a place in such a county is next adjacent; and it shall be tried in the court of <HI>B. R.</HI> by a jury from that place, according to the laws of that country, which may be given in evidence. 3 <HI>Inst.</HI> 27. <HI>Cro. Car.</HI> 247. 5 &amp; 6 <HI>Ed.</HI> 6. 2 <HI>Salk.</HI> 651.</P>
<P>Where civil causes are grown to issue, if they are to be tried in <HI>London</HI> or <HI>Middlesex,</HI> and the defendant lives not forty miles from <HI>London,</HI> in that case eight days notice of trial must be given the defendant; and if he live that distance from <HI>London,</HI> or further off, he must have fourteen days notice from the plaintiff, before he try his cause. But at the <HI>assizes</HI> eight days notice of trial is good, let the defendant live where he will; and if the defendant go to trial without sufficient notice given him, the trial is not binding. A defendant, on due notice given, must go to trial, or judgment will pass against him by default: and where the plaintiff will not try his cause in such time as he ought to do, by the rules of the court; the defendant may give a rule and notice for trying the cause by <HI>proviso,</HI> and so discharge himself of the action. 2 <HI>Lil. Abr.</HI> 613. <HI>Stat.</HI> 23 <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. <HI>c.</HI> 15.</P>
<P>In case the court sees that one of the parties is surprised, through some casualty, without any fault of his own, they may at their discretion put off the trial to another time, until such party is bet∣ter prepared: also if a defendant is not ready to try his cause, on pe∣tition, and affidavit of the reasons, the judge will order it to be stay∣ed till another day the same assizes; and in <HI>London</HI> until the next term, on payment of costs. A cause is to be entered in the judge's book two days before the time of trial, or it shall not be set down to be try'd that term; and if the issue is not joined between the plain∣tiff
<PB N="97" REF="010935_0051_0F852C80941E5C30"/>
and defendant, which consists of an affirmative on the one part and a denial of the charge on the other part, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it will not be a good trial. 2 <HI>Lil. Abr.</HI> 609.</P>
<P N="2">2. To proceed to trial in the courts at <HI>Westminster,</HI> after the till or writ issued and executed against the defendant, and appear∣ance thereupon made by him, the declaration is to be drawn and delivered with an imparlance to the defendant's attorney; and it must be entered that term on the prothonotary's roll, and docquet∣ted: the term following the plaintiff's attorney gives a rule with the secondary for the defendant to plead by such a day, or the plain∣tiff to have judgment; and the defendant having pleaded to the plaintiff's action and declaration, according to the case, so that the parties are at issue, the attorney for the plaintiff makes a co∣py of the issue, and gives it to the defendant's attorney, with notice of trial; in order to which, the <HI>venire facias</HI> must be made out and returned by the sheriff, and after is sued forth the <HI>habeas corpora</HI> to bring in the jury, and the record is made up; whereupon a trial is had, and a verdict being brought in by the jury, judgment is given accordingly, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But if the defendant do not plead, but lets it go by default, then upon entering judgment, a writ of inquiry of damages is to be award∣ed, returnable the next term, of the execution, whereof notice is to be given the defendant's attorney; which being executed, with the damages inserted in a schedule annexed to the writ, and re∣turned by the sheriff to the prothonotary's office, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and on a rule being given upon it, he taxes costs: then it is carried to the clerk of the judgments, and on giving him the number, roll, and term that the judgment was entered, he will make out a writ of execution, either a <HI>capias ad satisfaciendum</HI> or <HI>fieri facias,</HI> for the damages and costs.</P>
<P N="3">3. In the proceedings to trial at the <HI>assises,</HI> when any cause comes on, a <HI>distringas</HI> of the jury is to be first returned by the she∣riff, and then the record must be delivered to the judge's marshal; upon which, the counsel being instructed with their briefs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and all parties ready, the marshal gives the record to the judge, and the cryer calls over the names of the jury, and when they are sworn, being first elected by ballot, they are bid to stand together, and hear their charge; which done, the counsel on both sides open the case, first of the side of the plaintiff, as the proof lies on him, and looking over their <HI>Breviates</HI> argue the matter in contest, pro∣ducing the witnesses to prove what they aledge; and then the judge sums up the evidence, and gives it in charge to the jury, to do impartially therein: at which time the clerk of assise, or his associate, files the writ, panel and record together, and makes a

copy of the jury's names, and of the issue they are to try, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> delivers to the jury; and a bailiff being sworn to keep them with∣out meat, drink, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they are then kept together till they all agree on the verdict.</P>
<P>The jury, when they are agreed, return to give in their verdict▪ and the plaintiff is then called; and if he do not appear, a nonsuit shall be recorded, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but if he appears, the clerk asks the jury who they find for, and what costs, and damages, and so enters it on the back of the panel, and repeats it to the jury, which finished the trial: and after that is over, the associate delivers to the plain∣tiff's attorney the record with the <HI>distringas,</HI> and the names of the jury annexed, on the back of which he writes the substance of the verdict; then upon the back of the record is ingrossed the <HI>postea,</HI> (that afterwards the plaintiff and defendant came before such a judge, and the jury was elected and sworn, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and found such verdict and costs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) and after it is to be carried to the clerk of the <HI>postea's</HI> to be marked, and then 'tis delivered to the clerk of the rules, and he makes a four-days rule for judgment; which rule be∣ing out, if judgment be not arrested, the record is to be carried to the master of the office, who will tax further costs, when the judgment is fit to be entered, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And in trials at the assises, the record and <HI>distringas</HI> are generally kept by the associate till the next term, and he indorses the <HI>postea,</HI> receiving his fee for it at the trial; and then he is to be called upon for the same, and you proceed to have it marked, take out a rule, and sign judgment, as before is directed, and the judgment must be entered on a roll: also if a trial is had the last day of term, or at the sittings after, or the assises, judgment cannot be given thereupon until the first day of the next term; and judgment being entered, execution is awarded, and writs of <HI>capias ad satisfaciendum, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. There may be new trials granted, in several cases; as where sufficient notice was not given the defendant of the former trial; if excessive damages are assessed by the jury; or a verdict is given against evidence; and when there was any fraud, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But gene∣rally a new trial shall not be had for two small damages, except action of covenant is brought for a sum certain, and the jury give damages under that, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and it should not be granted for want of any evidence at a former trial, that the party might then have pro∣duced, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 2 <HI>Salk.</HI> 647.</P>

you cause to be done full and speedy justice to the said parties, which of right, and according to the laws and customs of our kingdom, you shall see ought to be done. Witness, &amp;c.</P></Q>
<P>By <HI>statute,</HI> persons charged in execution for any sum not ex∣ceeding 100 <HI>l.</HI> in any goal or prison being minded to deliver up all their effects to their creditors towards satisfaction of their debts, may exhibit a petition to the court from whence the process issued, certifying the cause of their imprisonment, and an account of their estate, &amp;c. and thereupon the court is by order or rule to cause the prisoner to be brought up, and the creditors to be summoned to appear at a day appointed, when the court shall in a summary way examine the matter, and hear what shall be alledged on both sides, for or against the discharge of such prisoner, tendering to the prisoner an oath, that the account delivered in is a full and true account of all his estate, (except wearing apparel and bedding, &amp;c. not exceeding 10 <HI>l.</HI> value;) and if thereupon the creditors are sa∣tisfied, the court may order the lands, goods and effects contained in the account to be assigned to the creditors, by indorsement on the back of the petition signed by the prisoner; and upon such assign∣ment executed, the prisoner shall be discharged out of prison, with∣out paying any see, by order of court: but in case the creditors shall not be satisfied with the oath, the court shall remand the prisoner, and order him and his creditors to appear at another day; and then if the creditors cannot discover any estate or effects of the prisoner omitted, &amp;c. the court shall immediately cause the prisoner to be discharged, unless any creditor insists upon his being detained, and agree to pay him <HI>2s. 4d. per</HI> week, and on failure of any payment, he shall be discharged. 32 <HI>Geo.</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 28.</P>
<P>The Person so discharged out of prison shall never after be ar∣rested for the same debt; but the judgment against him is to stand in force, and execution may be taken out thereon against his lands or goods, &amp;c. afterwards: and if any prisoner shall be convicted of perjury in his oath, he shall suffer the pains inflicted for such of∣fences, and may be retaken, and charged again in execution. <HI>Stat. ibid.</HI></P>
<P>And prisoners in execution as aforesaid, in any prison (except in <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster</HI>) before they petition the court to be discharged, &amp;c. are to give notice to their creditors at whose suit they were charged, that they design to petition, with a true copy of the account of their whole estates intended to be delivered in to the court, &amp;c. and then on such petition, the prisoner shall have a rule of court to be brought to the next assises for the coun∣ty; and the creditors shall be summoned to appear there thirty days before, and at the assises the judges on examination shall de∣termine

<HEAD>Of Estates in Lands and Goods, and how ac∣quired; Ancestors, heirs, Executors, and Administrators.</HEAD>
<P>ESTATE is that title or interest which a man hath in lands tenements, or other things. And estates are real, of lands and tenements; or personal, of goods and chattels; other∣wise distinguished into freeholds, that descend to the heir, and chattels which go to the executors: also some estates are made by words, and others implied by law; and the word <HI>estate</HI> in deeds and grants generally comprehends the whole in which the party hath an interest or property, and will pass the same.</P>
<P>The estates and lands we have in this kingdom, are obtained and held in divers manners:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. By discent and right of blood.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Conveyance, or grant from one man to another.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Antient tenures and holdings of lands.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><HI>Discent</HI> is where a man hath land or other estate of inheritance in fee-simple, and dieth without making any disposition thereof, but leaveth it to go (as the law calleth it) to the heir; it is a means whereby lands or tenements are derived to a man, as heir and by right of blood, from an ancestor; and this is the worthiest means whereby lands can be acquired. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 13, 237.</P>
<P>In discents, the next and most worthy of blood shall inherit; as the male and all descendants from him, before the females; and the elder brother and his posterity, before any younger bro∣ther, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> A sister of the whole blood shall be preferred before the younger brother of the half blood: but such younger brother may be heir to his father or uncle; though not to a brother, for want of the whole blood. And a person to have land in fee-simple, by discent, must be Heir of the whole blood: by which rule, where lands descend to the son from the father, and he enters and dies seised, without issue, this land shall go to the heirs of the part of the father; and if there be none such, it shall escheat. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 14. 3 <HI>Rep.</HI> 4.</P>
<P>And discent is lineal, or collateral; lineal is downwards in a right line, from grandfather to father, father to son, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the lineal heirs shall first inherit: collateral is a discent which springeth out of the side of the whole blood; as the grandfather's brother, father's brother, and so downwards: so that if a man purchase lands in fee-simple,
<PB N="109" REF="010935_0057_0F852C8B1CE1C898"/>
and dies without issue, for default of the right line, he who is next of kin in the collateral line of the whole blood, shall have the land, by discent as heir to him. In case of discents, when land descends on the part of the father, the heirs of the mother shall not inherit; and where lands descend on the part of the mo∣ther, the heirs of the father shall not inherit: 'tis otherwise in case of purchase, where a son purchases lands, and dies without leaving issue; if there be no heirs on the part of the father, those on the mother's side shall inherit the lands. 1 <HI>Inst.</HI> 10, 11, 13. 1 <HI>Vent.</HI> 415.</P>
<P>Inheritances may lineally descend, but not ascend; and in the right line, children shall inherit their ancestors without limitation; but the ancestors may not take from the children, for the father can never come to the lands which his son hath purchased by li∣neal ascent; though he may by collateral ascent, where the land of the son comes to his uncle, and then to his father: in the colla∣teral line, the uncle inherits the nephew, and the nephew the un∣cle. The elder brother of the whole blood shall have land by dis∣cent, that is purchased by a middle or younger brother, if they die without issue: and when there is no brother or sister, the un∣cle shall have it as heir; but it may afterwards descend to the fa∣ther, as heir to the uncle; and if after the discent to the uncle, the father hath issue another son or daughter, that issue shall enter upon the uncle, and hold the estate. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 11. 3 <HI>Rep.</HI> 40. <HI>Vaugh.</HI> 244.</P>
<P>There is a difference between discents from father and mother to their ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ldren, and between brothers and sisters; a son or daugh∣ter need be only of the blood either of father or mother, which hath the inheritance: but the brothers and sisters must be of the same father and mother, to inherit one another. From this it is, that if a man hath issue two sons by divers venters, the younger brother of the half blood shall not have the land purchased by the elder brother, on his dying without issue; but the elder brother's uncle or next cousin. If a man hath two wives, and by one wife he has a son and a daughter, and a son by the other, and then dies seised of land in fee-simple; here, if the elder son die with∣out any issue, before actual seisin, the land shall descend to the younger brother; but if the elder brother had entered, then the sister shall have the land as heir to him. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 14, 15. 3 <HI>Rep.</HI> 41. <HI>Noy</HI> 68.</P>
<P>As in discents one must be heir to him that was last actually seised; so none can inherit lands as heir, but the blood of the first purchaser. Though the law takes no notice of the disability of the father in case of discent, relating to brothers and sisters, as to
<PB N="110" REF="010935_0058_0F852C8BDE424EB0"/>
their estates: a man, who had issue a son and a daughter, was attainted of treason, the son having purchased lands, and died with∣out issue; and it was held, that notwithstanding the attainder of the father, the daughter shall take by descent from her brother, because the estate between them was immediate, and therefore the father's inability shall not hinder it. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 12. <HI>Lit.</HI> 8. 4 <HI>Leon.</HI> 5.</P>
<P>By discent, lands in fee-simple shall go, 1. To the eldest son as heir, and to his issue; the sons first, in order of birth, and for want of sons, to all the daughters equally, who are called parce∣ners, and all of them inherit as one heir. 2. If the eldest son hath no issue, then to his next eldest brother, of the whole blood, and his issue: and for want of a brother, to a sister or sisters of the whole blood, and her and their issue. 3. If there be no brother or sister, then to the uncle, and his issue; and for want of an uncle, to an aunt or aunts, and their issue. 4. And if there be no uncles or aunts, then to cousins, in the nearest degree of consanguinity. And where lands are purchased by <HI>brethren;</HI> after uncles and aunts, the land shall go to the father, and the half blood, and their issue; and for want of uncle, aunt, father and half blood, to the next of kin in the collateral line: here the half blood come in after the father, as being of the whole blood to him; tho' not to their bre∣thren. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 163, 12, <HI>&amp;c. Wood's Inst.</HI> 221. In discent of <HI>estates tail</HI> half blood is no hindrance; for the issue are in <HI>per for∣mam doni,</HI> and always of the whole blood to the donee. 3 <HI>Rep.</HI> 41.</P>
<P>Sometimes discent is by custom of fee-simple lands to all the sons, or to all the brothers, where one dies without issue, as in <HI>Gavelkind</HI> in the county of <HI>Kent:</HI> all the sons shall inherit, like unto sisters at common law; and the heir at the age of fifteen years may give and sell his lands, and tho' his father be attainted of treason or felony he shall inherit. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 140.</P>
<P>And there is a customary discent of lands in some antient bo∣roughs and manors, to the youngest son, and sometimes to the eldest daughter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as in <HI>Borough English;</HI> and by other customs: but where the youngest son dies, having no issue, the eldest son is heir to him. <HI>Kitch.</HI> 102.</P>
<P>As to discents of <HI>Borough English</HI> lands, the custom goes with the land, and guides the discent to the youngest son; altho' there be devises, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to the contrary. 2 <HI>Lev.</HI> 138.</P>
<P>In the learning of discents in general, there are some things further to be taken notice of:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Where parties are in by discent, or purchase.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Where discents toll an entry.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. Discent being created by law, and the most ancient title, an heir is in by that, before a grant, or devise. If a man gives fee-simple
<PB N="111" REF="010935_0058_0F852C8BDE424EB0"/>
lands by will to one who is heir at law, the devise is void, and he shall take by discent: and where a father devises his land to his wife for life, and after her decease to his eldest son; tho' the son doth not take the estate presently on the death of the fa∣ther, he shall be in by discent, and not by purchase, and the de∣vise shall be void as to him. <HI>Dy.</HI> 126. <HI>Style</HI> 148.</P>
<P>When the heir takes that which his ancestor would have taken if living, he shall take it by discent; and not by purchase: but generally where an estate is devised to the heir at law, attended with a charge, as to pay money, debts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in such case he takes by purchase, and not by discent. And a man can have lands no other way than by discent or purchase. 2 <HI>Danv. Abr.</HI> 557. <HI>Lutw.</HI> 593.</P>
<P N="2">2. A discent which takes away an entry is where one dies seised of lands, in which another hath right to enter, and it descends to his heir; such discent shall take away the other's right of entry, and put him to his action for recovery thereof: but a discent shall not take away the entry of lessee for years, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who hath no freehold; and if it be of such things as lie in grant; as advow∣sons, rents, commons in gross, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it puts not him that hath right to his action. And tho' where a desseisor dieth seised, and the law casteth the lands upon his heir, this is a discent which tolls an entry at common law; by statute, it is only where the disseisor had peaceable possession five years. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 237, 238. <HI>Stat.</HI> 32 <HI>H.</HI> 8. <HI>c.</HI> 33.</P>
<P>The heir is to enter into lands descended to him, to intitle him to the profits, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1. Feoffment is a grant or conveyance of any manors, messuages, lands or tenements to another in fee, to him and his heirs for ever, by the delivery of seisin and possession of the thing granted: and in every feoffment the grantor is called the feoffor, and he that re∣ceives by virtue thereof is the feoffee. And the livery and seisin is made in the presence of witnesses, all persons being removed from the
<PB N="112" REF="010935_0059_0F852C8D0EC70138"/>
lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> when the feoffee or his attorney makes an entry on the premisses. <HI>Lit. lib.</HI> 1.</P>
<P>The deed of feoffment is our most ancient conveyance of lands; and is said to excel the conveyance by fine and recovery: for it clears all disseisins, abatements, intrusions, and other wrongful estates, which no other conveyance doth; and for that it is so so∣lemnly and publickly made, it has been of all others the most ob∣served. It bars the feoffor of all present and future right, and col∣lateral benefit, as conditions, power of revocation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and de∣stroys contingent uses: but feoffment may not be of such things whereof livery of seisin cannot be made; the livery being a cere∣mony used by which the common people may see the passing or al∣teration of the estate; and if either of the parties die before livery and seisin, the feoffment will be void. <HI>West. Symb.</HI> 235. <HI>Plowd.</HI> 554, 214. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 5.</P>
<P>As a feoffment is a common law conveyance, and executed by li∣very, it makes a transmutation of estate; but a conveyance on the statute of uses, such as a covenant to stand seised, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> makes only a transmutation of possession, and not of estate. If a feoff∣ment in fee be inrolled, but no livery made; it is no good feoffment, but the inrolment shall conclude the person to say that it was not his deed: but where a bargain and sale of lands is not inrolled, and the bargainor delivers livery and seisin of the land, according to the form of the deed, it has been held a good feoffment. 2 <HI>Lev.</HI> 77. <HI>Poph.</HI> 6. 2 <HI>Ander.</HI> 68.</P>
<P>Where a man makes a feoffment, without any consideration; by that the estate passes, but not the use, which shall descend to the heir. A feoffment in fee, made by tenant in tail, doth not give the inheritance of the tail, to the feoffee, nor is he thereby te∣nant in tail; for none shall be such but he who is comprehended in the gift made by the donor: but it gives away all the imme∣diate estate the feoffor had: though if lessee for life, and the <HI>reve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sioner</HI> in fee, make a feoffment by deed, each grants his estate; the lessee his by livery, and the fee from him in remainder. <HI>Leon.</HI> 182. <HI>Plowd.</HI> 562. <HI>Hob.</HI> 335. 6 <HI>Rep.</HI> 15.</P>
<P>A deed of feoffment is always applied to a corporeal and im∣moveable thing; as a house, or land, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And a feoffment of lands, to hold to the feoffee and his heirs, after the death of the feoff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, though livery be made upon it, yet it is a void feoffment; for an estate of freehold in lands cannot begin at a day to come: but a lease for life in reversion, after the death of another, is a good estate in reversion. <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b.</HI> 171. 2 <HI>Nels.

2. Lease and release is the most common deed of conveyance now in use; to convey any right or interest in lands or tenements, to another who hath the possession thereof. And this conveyance by lease and release amounts to feoffment, the use drawing after it the possession, and supplying the place of livery and seisin, required in that deed.</P>
<P>In the making of it, a lease or bargain and sale for a year, or such like term, is first prepared and executed; to the intent that by virtue thereof the lessee may be in possession of the lands in∣tended to be conveyed by the release, and thereby, and by force of the statute 27 <HI>H.</HI>8. <HI>c.</HI> 10. for transferring of uses into posses∣sion, be enabled to take a grant of the reversion and inheritance of the said lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to the use of himself and his heirs for ever: upon which, the release is made, reciting the lease for a year, and declaring the uses. And in these cases, a pepper-corn rent in the lease for a year is a good reservation, and sufficient to raise an use, to make the lessee capable of a release. 2 <HI>Vent.</HI> 35.</P>
<P>The lease for a year must have the words <HI>bargain and sell</HI> for money; and 5<HI>s.</HI> or any other sum, although never paid, will be a good consideration; whereupon the bargainee for a year is im∣mediately in possession, on the executing the deed, without actual entry: but if only the words <HI>demise, grant, and to farm let,</HI> are used, in that case the lessee cannot accept of a release of the in∣heritance until he hath actually entered, and is in possession. 2 <HI>Lil. Abr.</HI> 435.</P>
<P>A lease and release make but one conveyance, being in the na∣ture of one deed: and to the perfection of this deed, it is required that he who makes the release have an estate in himself, out of which the estate may be derived to the relessee; the relessee is to have an estate in possession, in deed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in law, in the land where∣of the release is made, as a foundation for the release; and there must be sufficient words in law, not only to make the release, but to create and raise a new estate, or the release will not be good. It is necessary in all cases where a release of lands is made, that the estate be turned to a right, and there are two rights to the estate and also to the possession: or else there must be privity of e∣state between the tenant in possession and relessor, without which a release will not operate. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 22. <HI>Mod.</HI> 252. 2 <HI>Lil. Abr.</HI> 435.</P>
<P>In case a release be made by one, that at the time of the making thereof had no right; or to a man that at that time had nothing in the lands, such release is void, because he ought to have a freehold, or a possession, or privity. But if a man make a lease for life, re∣mainder for life, and the first lessee dieth; and then the lessor re∣leases to him in remainder, before entry, this is a good release to
<PB N="116" REF="010935_0061_0F852C8E2263C5A0"/>
enlarge his estate; he having an estate in law capable of enlarge∣ment by release before entry had. <HI>Noy Max.</HI> 74. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 270.</P>
<P>A release to a man and his heirs, will pass a fee-simple; and if made to a person and the heirs of his body, by this the relessee hath an estate-tail. And where a man releases to another all his right which he hath in the land, without using any more words, as to hold to him and his heirs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the relessse hath only an e∣state for life. <HI>Dy.</HI> 263.</P>
<P>These releases, that enure by way of passing away an estate, may be made upon condition, or with a defeazance; so as the con∣dition, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> be contained in the release, or delivered at the same time with it: and there may be in this deed a recital, covenant, warranty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>A confirmation is in nature of a release, where one having right unto lands makes a deed to him who has possession of them, to enlarge his estate, or make his possession perfect. And it is likewise a means whereby a voidable estate is made sure and unavoidable. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 295.</P>
<P>And this confirmation which is often joined to lease and release, may be for perfecting an estate, by making a conditional estate absolute; or for increasing it; as where an estate for years is made lease for life, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or it may be for diminishing, by confirm∣ing the estate of a tenant at a less rent: but the prior estate must not be void; for a confirmation will have no effect upon an estate that is void in law, or determined. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 301.</P>
<P>If tenant for life grant a rent-charge, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to one and his heirs, he in reversion is to confirm it; otherwise it is good only for the life of tenant for life. <HI>Lit.</HI> 529.</P>

A <HI>fine sur con∣cessit</HI> is where the cognisor is seised of the lands, and the cognisee hath no freehold therein, but it passeth by the fine; it is used to grant away estates for life, or years, and is also executory, so that the cognisee must enter, or have a writ of <HI>habere facias seismam</HI> to obtain possession, if the party to whom the estate is limited, be not in possession at the time of levying the fine. 2 <HI>Inst.</HI> 513. 2 <HI>Rep.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 5 <HI>Rep.</HI> 38. <HI>Plowd.</HI> 268.</P>
<P>Fines are likewise with proclamations or without; a fine with∣out proclamation is a fine at the common law; and the fine with proclamations is termed a fine according to the statutes, and this is the best fort, and most used: and if there be error in the pro∣clamations, it shall be a good fine at common law.

<P>A <HI>recovery</HI> is <HI>fictio juris,</HI> or a formal act by consent, used where a man is desirous to cut off an estate-tail, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and for the better assurance of lands and tenements, upon which uses may be limited and raised. It is much of the same nature of a fine, though bet∣ter in regard it bars remainders and reversions: and recoveries are much favoured by the law, many of the inheritances of the king∣dom depending upon these assurances. 5 <HI>Rep.</HI> 40.</P>
<P>This common recovery supposes a recompence in value, to all persons that lost the estate: and it is either with single, double or treble voucher. The recovery with single voucher is used to bar the tenant in tail, and his heirs, of such estate-tail which is in his possession, with the remainders depending upon it, and the rever∣sion expectant thereon which others have; and of all leases and incumbrances derived out of such remainder or reversion. The re∣covery with double voucher is to bar the first voucher, and his heirs, of every estate at any time in him, or any of his ancestors, whose heir he is of such estate; and all others of right to remain∣ders and reversions dependant and expectant upon the same, and all leases and incumbrances derived out of them; also it will be a bar of the estate whereof the tenant was then seised in reversion or remainder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The recovery with treble voucher is to make a perpetual bar of the estate of the tenant, and of every such estate of inheritance that at any time had been in the first or second vouchee, or their ancestors, whose heirs they are; and as well of every re∣version thereupon depending, as of all leases, estates, charges and incumbrances, derived out of any reversion or remainder. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 102. 10 <HI>Rep.</HI> 37. 2 <HI>Rol. Abr.</HI> 204. <HI>Noy</HI> 81.</P>
<P>In prosecuting recoveries there is a colourable suit; wherein there is a demandant, and a tenant, and one called to warrant upon a supposed warranty, who is the common vouchee; the de∣mandant is supposed to come into court, and the common vouchee to make default; and withdraw in contempt of the court; whereupon judgment is had, that the demandant, against whom there is no defence, shall recover the land. And in a recovery with single voucher, the writ of entry must be brought against te∣nant in tail in possession, and he is to vouch the common vouchee: but if the recovery be with double or treble voucher, then by fine, feoffment or lease and release, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> you are to discontinue the e∣state, and make a tenant of the freehold of the land; and there∣upon bring the writ against that tenant, and he is to vouch the te∣nant in tail, and he the common vouchee; and then judgment is
<PB N="127" REF="010935_0066_0F852C91F1E09DA0"/>
given for the demandant against the tenant, and for the tenant to recover in value against the vouchee, and so the first vouchee a∣gainst the second, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as the recovery is brought. 10 <HI>Rep.</HI> 39, 42. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 224. <HI>Wood's Inst.</HI> 252.</P>
<P>To every recovery there must be a good tenant to the <HI>praecipe,</HI> or it will be void: a recovery has been held good where a stranger that had nothing in the land was made tenant to the <HI>praecipe</HI> with the tenant in tail; for the supposed recompence in value shall go to him who lost the estate. If tenant for life, and he in remain∣der in tail suffer a common recovery, and both vouch the common vouchee; it is no good recovery to bar the issue in tail, because he in remainder was not tenant to the <HI>praecipe,</HI> being not in possession. But where there is tenant for life, the remainder in tail, with re∣version, or remainder in fee; if the tenant for life is impleaded by agreement, and he vouch the tenant in tail, and he vouch over the common vouchee; this will bar the remainder and reversion in fee, though he in remainder or reversion did never assent to the recovery. 2 <HI>Lil. Abr.</HI> 425. <HI>Vent.</HI> 358. <HI>Co. Rep.</HI> 15. 3 <HI>Rep.</HI> 60.</P>
<P>In case tenant for life surrenders to him in remainder in tail, he may bind the remainder and reversion expectant upon his estate: though if tenant for life alone suffer a recovery, without the con∣sent of him in remainder, the recovery is void. And here if te∣nants in tail after possibility of issue extinct, tenants by the curte∣sy, or for life, suffer a common recovery by covin, without the assent, and to the prejudice of him in remainder or reversion; not only the recovery shall be void, but it will be a forfeiture of the estate of such tenants. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 362. <HI>Stat.</HI> 14 <HI>Eliz. c.</HI> 8.</P>
<P>It was formerly a question, if there was a tenant in tail, re∣mainder for years, and tenant in tail suffers a recovery, whether the lease for years be barred or not? because it was insisted, that no recompence can go to this, being a chattle: but the court ad∣judged, that this lease should be barred, and so the constant ex∣perience had been. 2 <HI>Lev.</HI> 30. <HI>Mod. Rep.</HI> 110. A recovery suf∣fered by tenant in tail, after he himself hath made a lease of the lands, or entered into a statute, will make the lease or charge, that before was voidable, good against the issue in tail, and him in remainder or reversion; and the recoveror shall hold the lands charged, and subject to the lease made by tenant in tail. <HI>Co. Rep.</HI> 25.</P>
<P>A common recovery is the best assurance a man can have, so as to sell or dispose of his estate as he pleases; except an act of par∣liament. But a recovery bars only where there is a privity in law; as the issue of tenant in tail, and he in remainder, reversion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Strangers are not barred by a recovery and non-claim, as they are
<PB N="128" REF="010935_0067_0F852C92950689B0"/>
by a fine: nor shall it bar the heir, who claims as a purchaser, and not by discent; or when there is an executory estate, which depends upon a contingency; nor a rent granted by the tenant in tail, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And recoveries may be avoided if suffered by fraud, to deceive purchasers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> like any other fraudulent conveyance. 3 <HI>Rep.</HI> 5. <HI>Carter</HI> 53. <HI>Lutw.</HI> 1224. <HI>Cro.

<P>These recoveries are suffered in the Common Pleas, by the te∣nants and vouchers personally in court, or by attornies; and sometimes by attorney in the country on a <HI>dedimus potestatem, &amp;c.</HI> And most errors in a recovery are amendable the first time after the recovery had; but for gross error in the proceedings in matter of substance, a recovery may be made void, either by writ of er∣ror, or by pleading; or by motion in court, praying a <HI>vacat</HI> of the judgment. 8 <HI>Rep.</HI> 162. <HI>Co.

<P>A surrender is a deed or instrument testifying that the particular tenant, for life or years, of lands and tenements, doth yield up
<PB N="134" REF="010935_0070_0F852C96F2863440"/>
his estate to him who hath the immediate reversion or remainder, that he may have the present possession thereof; and where the e∣state for life or years may merge or drown, by the mutual agree∣ment of the parties. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 337.</P>
<P>The usual surrender at common law is of two sorts, a surrender in deed or by express words in writing, when the words of the lessee to the lessor prove a sufficient assent to give him his estate back again; and a surrender in law, being that which is wrought by operation of law, and not actual; as if lessee for life or years take a new lease of the same land during their term, it will be a surrender in law of the first lease: and in some cases this surrender is of greater force than the surrender in deed; for if a man make a lease for years to begin at a day to come, the future interest can∣not be surrendered by deed, because there is no reversion wherein it may drown: but if the lessee before the day takes a new lease of the same thing, 'tis a good surrender in law of the former lease. Also this kind of surrender by taking a new lease holds good, though the second lease is for a less term than the first, <HI>&amp;c. Co.

<P>To make a good surrender in deed of lands, the following things are required; the surrenderor is to be a person able to make the surrender, and the surrenderee capable to receive and take it; the surrenderor must have an estate in possession of the thing sur∣rendered, and not a future right; and the surrender is to be made to him that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath the next estate in remainder or reversion, without any estate coming between; the surrenderee must have a higher or greater estate in his own right, and not in the right of his wife, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> than the surrenderor hath in the lands, so that the surrender∣or's estate may be drown'd therein; there is to be privity of estate between the surrenderor and surrenderee; and the surrenderee must be sole seised of his estate in remainder, not in jointenancy; and agree to the surrender, <HI>&amp;c.

<P>A surrender may be of any thing grantable, either absolute or conditional; and may be made to an use, being a conveyance tied and charged with the limitation of an use: but it may not be of an estate in fee; nor of rights or titles only to estates for life or years; or for part of any such estate; nor may one termor regu∣larly surrender to another, If lessee for life surrender to him in re∣mainder for years, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it is a void surrender: though it has been held, that if a tenant for life, and one in remainder for life, sur∣render to him in reversion, it shall pass as several surrenders; first of him in remainder to the tenant for life, and then by the tenant

<PB N="136" REF="010935_0071_0F852C97134238B8"/>
either of those purposes, where there is no bargain and sale. And a gift is of a larger extent than a grant, extending to things move∣able and immoveable: though as to things immoveable, when taken strictly, it is applicable only to lands and tenements given in tail; but gifts and grants are often confounded. <HI>Wood's Inst.</HI> 263.</P>
<P>In this deed the person as gives is called the donor, and he to whom the thing is given is called the donee, and in like manner there is grantor and grantee, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The deed must have apt words to describe and set forth the persons of the donor and donee, that they be duly named, and also the thing given, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and all necessa∣ry circumstances, as sealing and delivery, and livery of seisin are to be observed; and if a deed of gift, or any other deed, be pro∣cured by duress of imprisonment of the party that makes it, for this it may be made void. <HI>Perk. Sect.</HI> 16. <HI>F. N. B.</HI> 202.</P>
<P>A deed of gift is good without any consideration; and a gift may be upon condition: but great care must be taken that there be no fraud in the case; for if a deed of gift and conveyance of lands is made with intent to defraud a purchaser upon good consideration, as against such purchaser it shall be void, and parties justifying the same to be <HI>bona fide</HI> made, shall forfeit a year's value of the lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And so it is if any deed of gift or grant, be made to defeat creditors of their just debts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The statute makes the deed void, against such creditors; but not against the party himself, his exe∣cutors or administrators, against whom it remains good. <HI>Co.

<P>The words give and grant, in deeds of gift, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of things which lie in grant, will amount unto a grant, a feoffment, a gift, re∣lease, confirmation or surrender, and may be pleaded, as a gift, or grant, release, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> at the election of the party: and the deeds of gift and grant are said to be alike in nature, and equal in power. 1 <HI>Inst.</HI> 301.</P>
<P><HI>Grant</HI> signifies a conveyance in writing of incorporeal things, not lying in livery; as of reversions, advowsons, tithes, services, rent, common in gross, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And grants are made by such persons as cannot give but by deed. <HI>West. Symb.</HI> 234.</P>

grantee may come upon the grantor's ground to cut and carry them away. Where the principal thing is granted, the incident shall pass with it; but not the principal by the grant of the inci∣dent. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 56, 152. 2 <HI>Inst.</HI> 309. <HI>Plowd.</HI> 15.</P>
<P>If lands are granted by deed, the houses which stand thereon will pass; for houses and mills pass by the grant of all lands, as land is the most durable thing on which they are built. By grant of all the lands the woods will pass: if a man grants all his trees in a certain place, this passeth the soil; tho' an exception of wood extends to the trees only, and not the soil of the land: and the trees in boxes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> pass not by the grant of land, because they are separated from the freehold. When a first description of lands, in a grant is true, if the second be false, this grant is good; but if the first be false, notwithstanding the second be true, nothing will pass by it. 4 <HI>Rep.</HI> 86. 5 <HI>Rep.</HI> 11. 3 <HI>Rep.</HI> 10. 6 <HI>Mod.</HI> 170.</P>
<P>Grants are to be of, things certain: and the law will not allow of a grant of imperfect interests, or of such as are merely future: in all grants there must be a foundation of interest, or they will not be good: the thing granted must be what is grantable; and it is to be granted in that manner the law requires; also there must be an acceptance of the grant, by him to whom made. One at∣tainted of treason or felony may make a grant; and be good a∣gainst all persons but the king, and the lord of whom the lands are held: grants made by persons <HI>non san<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e memori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> are voidable by their heirs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but good against themselves; and though infants, and feme coverts are not capable to be grantors, yet they may be grantees, subject to disagreement of the husband, and the infant at his full age. <HI>Perk.

<P>Deeds of grant may be void by incertainty, impossibility, being against law, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But where the grant is impossible, according to the letter, the law may make such construction as by possibility it may take place: and constructions of grants shall be agreeable to the intent of the parties. <HI>Co.

<P>Tenant in tail, remainder to the defendant in fee, lease for years, and dies without issue a week before the day of payment of the half year's rent; the lessee at the day pays all the half year's rent to the defendant; the executor of the tenant in tail brings his bill for apportionment of the rent. By the lord chancellor <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣wicke:</HI> This point has never been determined; but this is so strong a case, that I shall make it a precedent. There are in it two grounds for relief in equity; the first arises on the statute of the 11 <HI>Geo.</HI> 2. the second arises on the tenant's having submitted to pay the rent to the defendant; the relief arising upon the statute, is either from the strict legal construction, or equity founded upon the reason of it: and here it is proper to consider what the mis∣chief was before the act, and what remedy is provided at common law; if tenant for life, or any who had a determinable estate, died but a day before the rent reserved on a lease of his became due, the rent was lost, for no one was intitled to recover it; his represen∣tatives could not, because they could only bring an action for the use and occupation; and that would not lie where there was a lease, but debt or covenant; nor could the remainder man, because it did not accrue in his time. Now this act appoints the apportioning the rent, and gives the remedy. But there are two descriptions of the person, to whose executors the remedy is given; in the preamble, it is one having only an estate for life; in the enacting part, it is tenant for life; now tenant in tail comes expresly within the mis∣chief. I do not know how the judges at common law would con∣strue it; but I should be inclined in this court to ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd it to them; I should make no doubt, were this the case of tenant in tail after possibility of issue extinct, for he is considered in many respects as tenant for life only; he cannot suffer a recovery; he may be injoined from committing waste, such as hurts the inheri∣tance, as selling timber; tho' not for committing common waste, being considered as to that as tenant in tail; were it the case of tenant for years determinable on lives, he certainly must be includ∣ed within the act, tho' it says only tenant for life: it would be playing with the words to say otherwise; the cases shew the ne∣cessity of construing this act beyond the words; tenant in tail has certainly a larger estate than a mere tenant for life, for he has the inheritance in him, and may when he pleases turn it into a fee; but it he does not, at the instant of his death he has but an in∣terest for life: such too is the case of a wife tenant in tail <HI>ex pro∣visione ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iti:</HI> upon this point I give no absolute opinion. As to the equity arising from this statute, I know no better rule than
<PB N="142" REF="010935_0074_0F852C9E9A092940"/>
this, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>equitas sequitur legem:</HI> where equity finds a rule of law a∣greeable to conscience, it pursues the sense of it to analogous cases; if it does so as to maxims of the common law, why not as to the reasons of acts of parliament? nay, it has actually done so, on the statute of forcible entry; upon which, this court grounds bills, not only to remove the force, but to quiet the possession; that act requires a legal estate in possession: this court extends the reason to equitable interest, but I ground my opinion in this case upon the tenants having submitted to pay the rent; he has h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld himself bound in conscience to pay it, for the use and occupation of the land the last half year; he paid it to the defendant, which he was not bound to do in law; and in such a case, the person he pays it to shall be accountable, and considered as receiving it for those who are in equity intitled to it. The division must be that pre∣scribed by the statute, and then the plaintiff is intitled to such a proportion of the rent as accrued during the testator's life, and ac∣cordingly it was decreed. <HI>Burn's Just. qua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>to</HI> 313.</P>

<P>This clause also proceedeth upon a supposition, which perhaps may not be true, namely, that the tenant is a man of substance; it is more likely, that if he were able to live elsewhere, he would not chuse to hold over under such circumstances, nor perhaps would the landlord want to be rid of him: the putting him out of possession by some expeditious and easy method, seemeth the more adequate remedy in this case also, in like manner as is provided in the case where the tenant deserteth the premisses. <HI>ibid.</HI> 312.</P>

A feoffment in fee, or lease for life or years, may be made with proviso, that if the feoffor or grantor, their heirs or

<P>Although a lessee make an assignment over of his term, yet ac∣tion of debt lies against him for the rent, by the lessor or his heir, (not having accepted rent from the assignee:) but where a lessee assigns his term, and the lessor his reversion, the privity is deter∣mined, and action of debt doth not lie for the reversioner against the first lessee. On an assignment of the lessee, before acceptance of rent from the assignee, the lessor may charge either the lessee or assignee with the rent, at his election; tho' if he once accepts the rent from the assignee, knowing of the assignment, he cannot afterwards bring debt against the lessee for rent. As the rent issues out of the land, the assignee generally who has the land, and is privy in estate, is debtor in respect thereof: yet if an assignment be made by an assignee, to any one whatever, the first assignee is not suable for any rent; here, if he be accepted by the lessor, the admission of one assignee is the admission of twenty. <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> 472. 3 <HI>Rep.</HI> 23, 32.</P>
<P>An assignee is he who hath the whole estate of the assignor: and there is assignee in deed, being such person to whom a lease or estate is assigned by deed; and assignee in law, whom the law makes so without deed; as an executor appointed by will is in law assignee to the testator: but if there be assign in deed, the assign in law is not allowed. Where a grant is made to a man and his heirs, though the word <HI>Assigns</HI> be not expressed, he may assign at his pleasure; for the word <HI>Assigns</HI> is included in heirs: and as∣signees may take advantage of forfeitures on conditions, when they are incident to the reversion, as for rent, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and regularly every assignee of the land may have advantage of inherent covenants; also assigns are bound by such covenants, as a covenant to repair, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for the benefit of the estate, although not named. <HI>Co.

<P>But when a covenant concerns a thing not in being, at the time of the demise, as to make a new edifice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the assignee is not bound, except he be named in express words; nor is he when
<PB N="152" REF="010935_0079_0F852CA25BBC5B68"/>
named, if the thing to be done, doth not concern the thing demi∣sed; or in contracts merely personal. A lessee covenanted for himself and his assigns, to rebuild a house before such a time, which he did not do, but after the time expired he assign'd the term; and it was held that this covenant would not bind the as∣signee, because it was broken before the assignment. <HI>Rol.

<P N="10">10. A will is the declaration of a man's mind and intent, as to the disposition of his lands or goods, of what he would have done after his death. The common law calls that a will, when lands and tenements are devised; and where it concerns chattels alone, it is termed a testament. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 111.</P>
<P>In a will made of goods there must be an executor named; but not of lands only, without goods, for executors have nothing to do with the freehold. If lands are given by will, 'tis called a devise, and goods and chattels a legacy; and there is this diver∣sity between lands and goods given by a will, that when lands are devised in fee, or for life, the devisee shall enter without any ap∣pointment of others: but in case of goods, there must be the as∣sent of the executor, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Where lands or tenements only are
<PB N="154" REF="010935_0080_0F852CA34508A688"/>
devised by will, the will ought to be proved in the chancery; if of goods and chattels it must be done in the spiritual court: and a will both of lands and goods may be proved in that court. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 111. <HI>Swinb.</HI> 24.</P>
<P>All persons, who have a sole estate in fee-simple of any lands, tenements or hereditaments, may give and devise the same by last will and testament, at their free will and pleasure; so as such per∣sons are not feme coverts, infants, persons <HI>Non san<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e memori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, &amp;c.</HI> whose wills shall not be good in law: and by the Stat. 29 <HI>Car.</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 3. perpetuated by 1 <HI>Jac.</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 17. <HI>s.</HI> 5. for prevention of frauds, all devises of lands or tenements are to be in writing, signed by the devisor, or some by his express directions, in the pre∣sence of three credible witnesses, at least; and no devise in writ∣ing shall be revoked, but by some other will in writing, or by cancelling the same by the testator himself, or by his direction, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And where nuncupative wills, by word of mouth, are made for the disposition of chattels above 30 <HI>l.</HI> value, they must be de∣clared in presence of three witnesses, bid to bear witness, in the last sickness of the party, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the substance of them must be reduced into writing, within six days after the making <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Lands entailed are not deviseable by will; only fee-simple lands, and goods and chattels. 32 <HI>H.</HI> 8. <HI>c</HI> 1. 29 <HI>Car.</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 3. 3 <HI>Rep.</HI> 31. <HI>Co.

<P>The construction of wills is more favoured in law than any o∣ther deed or conveyance, to fulfil the intent of the testator: be∣cause the testator is supposed to be <HI>inops consilii,</HI> and in a hurry, and a devise is not a conveyance by common Law, but by the sta∣tute: the devises before the statute were by custom, and as custom enabled men to dispose of their estates contrary to the common law; so it exempted this kind of conveyance from the regularity and propriety required in other conveyances; and thus it came to pass that wills upon the statute, in imitation of those by custom, gained such favourable construction. Words in wills are always construed according to the intention of the parties that make them, as near as can be collected: but the words and intent must agree with the law; and if the words are insensible and repug∣nant, they are void. 3 <HI>Salk.</HI> 127, 128. <HI>Co.

<P>An infant makes his will for lands, and when of age he declares it as his will, yet it is void; but an infant at fourteen years old may make a will of his goods and chattels.

A person, when he makes his will, ought not only to have his memory to answer questions, but to have perfect mind and memory: and one must have as good disposing memory when he revokes his will, as when he makes it: but if there be any disagreement of wit∣nesses therein, their testimony is to be preferred, which depose that the testator was of sound memory, for the support of the tes∣tament. <HI>Co.

<P>If a man bid another make his will, and before it is done he dies, the will is not good: though if it be drawing up in his pre∣sence, it may be good for the devises finished. A will was made since the statute 29 <HI>Car.</HI> 2. by which lands were devised, but no name subscribed to it, being sealed in the presence of three witnes∣ses, was adjudged a good will; the will being written by the party himself, and his name in the will, which was held a sufficient signing: and a will may be good to convey lands, altho' it be not sealed; the statute of wills speaking nothing of sealing. <HI>Plowd.</HI> 10, 343. 3 <HI>Lev.</HI> 1. 2 <HI>Danv.

<P>A testator devised by will all his lands, tenements and estate whatsoever, whereof he should be possessed at the time of his death; and after this he purchased lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and it was held, that a devise of personal things was good, tho' the testator had them not at the time of the will; but a chattel real, as a lease for years, doth not pass: and a devise of lands is not good, if the testator at that time had nothing in them. By devise of all a man's lands and tenements, all the lands he hath in possession, and also in reversion, do pass: but where a person, having lands in fee, and other lands for years, devises all his lands and tenements, the fee-simple lands only pass; tho' if he hath only leases for years, by such devise, those leases shall pass to the devisee. <HI>Goulsb.</HI> 93. <HI>Salk.</HI> 237. 2 <HI>Danv.

<P>The devise of all a man's inheritance carries a fee-simple: also lands given to a person to dispose of at pleasure, makes a fee.

<P N="1">1. A bill of sale is an instrument used for transferring the pro∣perty of goods and chattels: and it can never be without a con∣sideration.</P>
<P>A person may at any time sell his goods, even though an exe∣cution be coming out against him; unless there is a private trust between the parties, and the writ of execution is delivered to the sheriff, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And where a bargain is, that one shall give me so much for a horse, and he gives one shilling or a penny in earnest, which I accept, this is a perfect sale. <HI>Noy Max.</HI> 87.</P>
<P>Where one agrees for goods sold, the buyer must not carry them away before paid for; except a day of payment is allowed him by the seller. The seller of things is to keep them for a rea∣sonable time, for delivery: but where no time is appointed for the delivery thereof, or for payment of the money, it is generally implied that delivery be made immediately; and payment on the delivery. And on sale of goods in a shop, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the seller may not bring an action for the money agreed, 'till the goods are delivered. <HI>Noy</HI> 87. 3 <HI>Salk.</HI> 61.</P>
<P>It hath been held, that on sale of goods, if earnest be given to the seller, and part of them is taken away by the buyer, he must pay the residue of the money upon fetching away the rest, because no other time is appointed; and the earnest binds the bargain, and gives the buyer a right to demand the goods, but a demand with∣out paying the money is void: and if the buyer doth not take a∣way the goods, and pay the money, the seller ought to require him so to do; and then if he doth not do the same in convenient time, the bargain and sale is dissolved, and the seller may dispose of them to any other person. <HI>Salk.</HI> 113.</P>
<P>A sale of goods upon a <HI>Sunday,</HI> tho' in a fair or market, will not alter the property: and in markets, all contracts for any thing sold there, to make them binding, are to be made as follows: the sale is to be in a place that is open, and in a proper place for such goods; it must be a sale for valuable consideration, and the buyer is not to know that the seller hath a wrongful possession; the sale not to be fraudulently betwixt two, to bar another; there is to be a sale and a contract, by persons able to contract, and the

sale may not be in the night, but between sun and sun; and toll must be paid, where required by statute, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Also there are toll-takers or book-keepers, who enter the names of buyers and sellers of, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are to be rid or stand in the open fair or market one hour; and all the parties to the contract must be present with the horse: the sellers shall likewise produce vouchers of the sale to them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 2 <HI>Inst.</HI> 713. 5 <HI>Rep.</HI> 83. <HI>Stat.</HI> 2 &amp; 3 <HI>P.</HI> &amp; <HI>M. c.</HI> 7. 31 <HI>Eliz.</HI> 12.

<P>By statute, a contract for the sale of goods for 10 <HI>l.</HI> or upwards, shall not be good, except the buyer receive part of the goods sold; or gives something in earnest to bind the bargain; or some note thereof to be made in writing, signed by the party to be charged with the contract, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And where contracts are not to be per∣formed in a year, they must be in writing, or no action can be brought on them; so that a contract for goods under 10 <HI>l.</HI> value, if not to be had in a year, must be in writing, or shall be void: but if no day is set, or the time is uncertain, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they may be good without. 29 <HI>Car.</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 3. perpetuated by 1 <HI>Jac.</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 17. <HI>s.</HI> 5.</P>
<P>If a man affirms things sold are of such a value, when they are not, this is not actionable; tho' it is, if he actually warrants them: but where one warrants any thing sold, after the time of sale, it is not good; for 'tis to be at the time of the sale to be binding. <HI>Cro.

<P N="2">2. A gift of goods is made either by deed, by word, or in law: and all goods and chattels personal may be given without deed, ex∣cept in some special cases. <HI>Perk.</HI> 57.</P>
<P>But a general gift of all a man's goods without any exception, though this be by deed, it is liable to suspicion as fraudulent, to deceive creditors: and therefore whenever any gift shall be made, in satisfaction of debt, it is good to make it in a publick manner before neighbours; that the goods and chattels be appraised to the value, and the gift expresly made in satisfaction of the debt; and that on the gift of the goods the donee take possession of them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 4 <HI>Rep.</HI> 80. <HI>Hob.</HI> 230.</P>
<P>As to gifts by word, if a man intending to give a jewel to one, say to him, here I give you my ring, with the ruby in it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and with his own hand delivers it to the party; it would be a good gift, notwithstanding the ring should bear any other jewel, being delivered by the party himself to the party to whom given. Here a gift of any thing without consideration, will be good; but it is revokable before the delivery to the donee of the thing given: and in case I give to you one of my horses in my stable, there you shall have your election to chuse which you will. <HI>Bac. Max.</HI> 87. <HI>Jenk. Cent.</HI> 109. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 145.</P>
<P>The gift in law is when a man is married to a woman, the law gives all the goods of the wife to the husband by the mar∣riage; and if a person be made executor of a will, on his taking upon him the executorship, the law gives and transfers the pro∣perty of the testator's goods to such executor: though in these cases, it is as it were conditional; for the husband is liable to the debts of the wife, and the executor to the debts of the testator. <HI>Co.

<P>It is the same where one takes my goods as a trespasser, and I in action recover damages for them; the law gives him the pro∣perty of the goods, he having paid for them. 2 <HI>Shep. Abr.</HI> 266.</P>

<P N="3">3. Agreement is the mutual consent of parties, or joining toge∣ther of two or more minds, in any thing done, or to be done. A contract is a bargain between two persons, where one thing is given for another, which is called <HI>quid pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> quo;</HI> and if there be not one thing for another, or some consideration, it is a nude contract and void in law. A covenant is an agreement made by deed in writing, between two or more, to do or not to do some act agreed upon betwixt them. <HI>Terms de Ley</HI> 32, 459.</P>
<P>Agreements are either executed already at the beginning, or executory, to be performed <HI>in futuro;</HI> and are governed by the intention of the parties: they ought to be perfect, full and com∣pleat, so as to be executed with a recompence; or give an action or other remedy for it. An agreement without satisfaction is as no∣thing; and a forced agreement of the party is accounted no agree∣ment; therefore he that did agree to the thing shall not be com∣pelled to perform it. <HI>Plowd.</HI> 290. 2 <HI>Mod.</HI> 8. <HI>Cro. Car.</HI> 193. <HI>Lil. Abr.</HI> 48.</P>
<P>Any thing under hand and seal, which imports an agreement, will amount to covenant; and a <HI>proviso</HI> by way of agreement amounts
<PB N="164" REF="010935_0085_0F852CA6D923C2B0"/>
to covenant. And a covenant is either in fact, or in law: in fact is that which is expresly agreed between the parties, and in∣serted in the deed; and in law is that covenant which the law in∣tends and implies, though it be not expressed in words. A servant covenants and agrees to serve me a year, and I covenant to pay him a sum of money for it; here he may have an action against me, although he do not serve me; but then I may oblige him to serve out the time. <HI>Lev.</HI> 155. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 204.</P>
<P>A covenant is no duty 'till broken: in covenants the last words, that are general, shall be expounded by the first words which are special and particular: and if some covenants in a deed are good and lawful, and others not; those against law are void, and the other shall stand good. 2 <HI>Ventr.</HI> 218. <HI>Plowd.</HI> 287. 11 <HI>Rep.</HI> 27.</P>
<P>There can be articles of agreement made, to be performed only by the parties; or by them and their executors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> wherein both of them are obliged to do something, according to the mat∣ter agreed upon.</P>

<P N="4">4. Bond or obligation is a deed in writing obligatory, whereby one doth bind himself to another, under his hand and seal, to pay a sum of money, or do some other act: a bond contains an obli∣gation with a penalty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and a condition, which expresly men∣tions what money is to be paid, or other thing to be performed, and the limited time for performance thereof; for which the obli∣gation is peremptorily binding. And a bond differs from a bill, which is generally without a penalty or condition, tho' a bill may be obligatory. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 172.</P>
<P>A bond or obligation may be made from one to one, or two,
<PB N="165" REF="010935_0085_0F852CA6D923C2B0"/>
three or more; or be from two persons or more, to one, two, three, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> If a bond hath not a date, or hath a false or impossible date, if it be sealed and delivered, it is a good obligation from the delivery: and if one binds himself to pay twenty pounds, but doth not say when it shall be paid, the bond is good, and money due presently. Also in case <HI>A.</HI> binds himself to <HI>B.</HI> in thirty pounds to be paid to <HI>A.</HI> whereas it should be to <HI>B.</HI> the obligation will be good, and the <HI>Solvendum</HI> void. 2 <HI>Rep.</HI> 5. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 108, 209. 3 <HI>Lev.</HI> 21, 137.</P>
<P>All conditions of bonds must be to do things lawful and possible: and when the matter or thing to be done, or not to be done by a condition, is unlawful or impossible; or the condition is repug∣nant, insensible or incertain, the condition is void, and in some cases the obligation likewise.

If a duty be uncertain at first, to be made certain after, being in the mean time but a mere possibility, it can't be released: but a duty

<P>The word <HI>Heirs</HI> makes the inheritance: and an estate granted, to hold a man for ever, or to him and his assigns for ever, is only for life, the words <HI>his heirs</HI> being wanting. A gift to one and his children, and their heirs, in a fee-simple to all jointly that are a∣live: though if lands be given to a man and his heir, in the sin∣gular number, it is but for life; and the heir cannot take by discent, he being but one, and therefore shall take nothing. Where lands are given or granted to a man and his successors, this creates no fee-simple; except it be to a corporation, when it doth. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 8, 9.</P>
<P>A fee-simple determinable upon a contingency is a fee to all in∣tents;
<PB N="173" REF="010935_0089_0F852CACCFBEE240"/>
tho' not so durable as an absolute fee: and there are said to be three sorts of fee-simple: fee absolute to a man and his heirs for ever; fee-simple conditional, when the estate is defeasible by not performing a condition; and a qualified fee, which may be defeated by a limitation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But a fee conditional or qualified are not properly fee-simple.

<P>At the common Law, all estates were fee-simple; and all other estates are derived out of it, so that there must be a fee at last in some body: but a fee-simple cannot be limited upon a fee-simple; nor may any remainder, as it is an absolute estate, and nothing can be after it.

<P>All lands of inheritance, and inheritances favouring of the realty, may be entailed; rents, profits, uses, offices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which concern lands, or certain places, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But where the grant of an inheri∣tance is meerly personal, or exercised with chattels, and not is∣suing out of land, no entail may be made: and a lease for years to a man and the heirs of his body, will be void; because the chattel cannot be turned into an inheritance; but it may be assign'd in trust to permit the issue in tail, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to receive the profits. It is in∣cident to the estate of tenant in tail, to be dispunishable of waste; that the wife of the donee shall be endowed; and the husband of of a feme donee be tenant by the curtesy; that the tenant in tail may suffer a common recovery; and that such tenants may levy a fine to bar issues, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> also they may make leases according to the sta∣tute 32 <HI>H.</HI> 8. and by custom grant lands by copy <HI>&amp;c.

In the first case, whatever woman the man takes to wife, or whatever man the woman takes to husband, the issue by any of them may inherit one after ano∣ther;

<P>Where lands are given to the husband and wife, and the heirs of their bodies, both of them have an estate in special tail: if lands and tenements are given to a man and his wife, and to the heirs of the body of the man, the husband hath an estate in gene∣ral tail, and the wife an estate for life; because the word <HI>Heirs</HI> re∣lates generally to the body of the husband. And if the estate is made to the husband and wife, and to the heirs of the body of the wife, there the wife hath an estate in special tail, and the husband for term of life only; the word <HI>Heirs</HI> relating to the body of the wife to be begotten by that particular husband.

<P>If a woman tenant in tail general takes a husband, and hath issue by him, which issue dieth, and the wife also some time after∣wards dies in the life time of the husband, without having any further issue, here the husband shall be tenant by the curtesy: for though the estate-tail be determined, yet the husband is intitled by the first issue before the estate was spent. And four things are re∣quisite to estate by the curtesy; marriage, seisin, issue and death of the wife: and this ought to begin by the issue, and be consum∣mate by the wife's death; and the estate of tenant by the curtesy should avoid the immediate discent. <HI>Terms de Ley</HI> 206. <HI>Co.

<P>Copyhold land cannot be made at this day; for the pillars of a copyhold estate are, That it hath been demised time out of mind by copy of court-roll; and that the tenements are parcel of or within the manor. A manor is lost where there are no customary tenants or copyholders: and if a copyhold comes into the hands of the lord, and he leases it for one year, or half a year or for any cer∣tain time, it can never be granted by copy after; and if a copy∣holder bargains and sells his copyhold to a lessee for years, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> his copyhold is extinguished. <HI>Co.

<P>The grant of copyhold estates regularly passeth by surrender and admittance: a copyholder cannot transfer his interest to a stranger, otherwise than by surrender to the lord, to the use of him that is to have the estate. By the common custom of copyhold estates, copyholders may surrender in court, and need not alledge any par∣ticular custom for it: though if they surrender out of court, into the hands of the lord by customary tenants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> particular custom must be pleaded; surrenders may be made by attorney, but not admittances. Copyholder for life pleaded a custom, that every co∣pyholder for life might in the presence of two other copyholders appoint who should have his estate after his death, without any sur∣render to his use; and that those copyholders might assess a fine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and it was adjudged a good custom.

<P N="1">1. Ancestor signifies as much as a predecessor, or one that has gone before in a family: but the law makes a difference between what we commonly call an ancestor, and a predecessor; the one being applied to a natural person and his ancestors, and the other to a body politick and their predecessors.</P>
<P>A prepossessor of an estate hath been called ancestor; and there is homage ancestrel, and some writs that are called ancestrel, <HI>&amp;c. Homage Auncestrel</HI> is where a man and his ancestors have time out of mind held their land of the lord by homage, or service of submis∣sion; and such lord is obliged to acquit the tenant against all other lords above him, and if the tenant is impleaded, shall warrant the land, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But there must be a double prescription for it; so that the same tenant and his ancestors, whose heirs he is, to hold the same land of the same lord and his ancestors also, whose heir the lord is, time out of memory, <HI>&amp;c.

Orig.</HI> 223, 30.</P>
<P N="2">2. An heir is one that succeeds by discent, to lands, tenements and hereditaments, being an estate of inheritance: and a person cannot be heir 'till after the death of the ancestor; for in his life-time, he is only heir apparent, or at law. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 8.</P>
<P>The word <HI>Heirs</HI> comprehends heirs of heirs <HI>in infinitum:</HI> if lands are given to a man and his heirs, all his heirs are so totally in him, that he may give his lands to whom he will. But a bas∣tard; an alien, though born in lawful wedlock; persons attainted of treason or felony, whose blood is corrupted, may not be heirs. An ideot or lunatick, one excommunicated, an outlaw in debt, trespass, persons attainted in a <HI>Praemunire, &amp;c.</HI> may be heir to a man. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 9, 21.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="010935_0095_0F852CB52C6BF2C0"/>
An ancestor could not by the common law, convey away lands by will from his heirs at law, without consent of the heir; but by the Stat. 32 <HI>H.</HI> 8. of wills, the law is altered in that point. The heir being very much favour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> at law, dubious words in a will ought to be interpreted for his benefit; and not to disinherit him: an heir shall enfore an administrator to pay debts with the personal estate, to preserve the inheritance: he is not bound in the bond of his ancestor, unless expresly bound; if in a bond a man binds his heirs, but not himself, it is void. A man shall never bind his heir to warranty, where he himself was not bound: a grant of an annuity must be for a man and his heirs, to bind the heir, though there be assets; and if named, an heir shall not be bound, except there be assets, as lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by discent. 2 <HI>Lil.

<P>Where <HI>Cestuy que Trust</HI> dies, leaving a trust in fee-simple to descend to the heir; this trust will be assets by discent in the heir's hands, and be liable to the obligation of his ancestors: and 'tis said, when assets descend, a <HI>Scire facias</HI> for debt lies against the heir of an heir, to the tenth degree. Heirs and executors are both chargeable upon specialties: but if the heir is sued for the debt of his ancestor and pays it; he shall be reimbursed by the ex∣ecutor of the obligor, who hath personal assets. 29 <HI>Car.</HI> 2, 3. perpetuated by 1 <HI>Jac.</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 17. <HI>s.</HI> 5. <HI>Noy</HI> 56. <HI>Dy.</HI> 303. <HI>Chanc.

<P>An heir may bring an action against one that injures the monu∣ment, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of his ancestor.

<P N="3">3. Executor is he to whom the execution or performance of a man's will is committed after his death. All persons that are ca∣pable of making a will may be executors; and so may some others; as an infant may be executor, but not act till seventeen years of age; a woman covert may be appointed executor; so may an ex∣communicate or outlawed person, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But popish recusants con∣vict cannot be executors. 4 <HI>Inst.</HI> 335. 5 <HI>Rep.</HI> 29. 6 <HI>Rep.</HI> 67.</P>
<P>If a man, who is neither executor or administrator, acts as an executor; as when he takes into his hands the goods of the de∣ceased, and converts them to his own use, or alters the property by sale, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or if he deliver the goods to creditors or legatees; receive any debt due to the deceased, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> he is executor in his own wrong, and shall be sued as executor: but every taking of the deceased's goods, is not an acceptance to make one charge∣able▪
<PB N="186" REF="010935_0096_0F852CB76A642470"/>
for if a man take away his own goods in the house of the deceased; or use some of the goods of the deceased in the necessa∣ry occasions of his family; bury the deceased, and sell his goods for that purpose, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> these will not make a man executor in his own wrong. 5 <HI>Rep.</HI> 31. 8 <HI>Rep.</HI> 135. 9 <HI>Rep.</HI> 39. <HI>Dy.</HI> 166. <HI>Noy's Max.</HI> 103.</P>
<P>Executors legally appointed may accept or refuse executorship: and if there are many, and one proves the will, and takes upon him the executorship, it will do for all; but the rest may at any time after join with him, and intermeddle with the estate; but in case they all refuse, none of them ever after will be admitted: here the ordinary, or where an executor dies before the will is proved, grants administration with the will annexed. In the eye of the law all, who take upon them executorship, are but as one execu∣tor; and most acts done by or to any one of them, are acts done by or to all: actions are to be brought by executors, in the name of all of them, altho' some refuse the executorship: though he or those only that administer shall be sued, in actions against them. 9 <HI>Rep.</HI> 37. <HI>Perk.</HI> 485. <HI>Co.

<P>As an executor hath his power wholly by the will, he may take the goods himself, or authorize another to seize them for him; or may release an action, debt or duty, or do any thing as executor, before probate of the will, so as he afterwards proves it; unless it be bringing of actions for debts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to maintain which, he must shew the testament proved. His office is to bury the testator in a decent manner, according to his rank, and with regard to the e∣state left: he is to make an inventory of all goods and chattels of the deceased, with their value, and all debts due to the testator; then prove the will in common form before the ordinary, by his own oath, or by witnesses, if required; and being exhibited in the register's office of the ecclesiastical court, a copy in parchment is delivered the executor, under the ordinary's seal, which is the probate: and when all this is done, an executor must pay all debts, before legacies, in the order following, <HI>viz.</HI> After the funeral charges, the king's debt is to be preferred; then debts on judg∣ments and statutes; debts on mortgages, bonds and other speci∣alties; rent, servants wages, debts on shopbooks, &amp;<HI>c.

<P>Amongst debts of equal degree, the executor may pay himself first: but if he pays the debts in any other order, he is answerable for the debts of a higher degree, altho' it be out of his own estate. Those debts, that are first sued for, shall be first paid; and where no suit is begun, the executor may pay the whole debt to any one creditor in equal degree, though there be no assets left to satisfy an∣other

any part of his debt. Where there are two executors, and one dies, debt is to be brought against the surviving executor; not the survivor and the executor of the deceased: but in equity, the testator's goods are liable in whosoever hands they are. And by statute, executors of executors shall answer for goods, as th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> first executor: also they may bring actions of debt, account, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and executors shall have the like writs, actions and process, as the testator might have had, and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>espass and damages for wrong done to him. <HI>Noy Max.</HI> 104. <HI>Leon.

<P>After the debts are paid by the executor, he is to pay the lega∣cies; in payment whereof he may prefer a legacy to himself: then he may pay what legacies he pleases first; or pay each legatee a part in proportion, if there be not enough to pay every one his whole legacy; and he is not bound to order, as in case of debts due from the testator. But if there be a specifick legacy, as of a silver tankard, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> this must be delivered before any other lega∣cy; if there be assets: and where there is enough to pay all the legacies, they shall be paid; but where there is not enough to pay debts, or more, the legatees must lose their legacies.

<P N="1">1. Marriage was instituted in a state of innocence, for preser∣vation thereof, and is one of the rights of human nature; and as to the solemnization of marriage, this is a civil right, regulated by the laws and customs of the kingdom or country where we re∣side; and every state allows such privileges to the parties as it deems expedient, and denies legal advantages to those who refuse to solemnize their marriage in the manner it requires: but they cannot dissolve a marriage celebrated in another manner, marri∣age being of divine institution, to which only a full and free con∣sent of the mind is necessary. <HI>Moor</HI> 170.</P>
<P>There is a marriage in right or in possession; and marriage <HI>de facto,</HI> or in reputation, as among quakers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which is allowed to be sufficient to give title to a personal estate: tho' in the case of a <HI>Dissenter,</HI> who was married to a woman by a minister of the congregation, not in orders, it was held, that when a husband de∣mands a right due to him as husband by the ecclesiastical law, he ought to prove himself a husband by that law to intitle him to it: yet this marriage was not a meer nullity, because by the law of na∣ture the contract is binding.

<P>To guard against private marriages, it is ordained, that parsons, vicars or curates, marrying any persons, or employing other mini∣sters to do the same, without publishing the banes of matrimony according to law, or without a licence for the marriage first had and obtained, shall forfeit 100 <HI>l.</HI> the persons so married 10 <HI>l.</HI> and parish-clerks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> assisting, knowing it to be so, 5 <HI>l.</HI> by the sta∣tute 7 &amp; 8 <HI>W.</HI> 3. <HI>c.</HI> 35.

<P>By the ordinances of our church, when persons are to be marri∣ed, the banes of matrimony shall be published in the parish-church where they dwell three several sundays or holidays, in the time of divine service; and if at the day appointed for their marriage, any man do alledge any impediment, as precontract, consanguinity, or affinity, parents not consenting, where under age, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> why they should not be married, and become bound with sufficient sureties to prove his allegation; then the solemnization must be deferred, untill such time as the truth is try'd: and no minister shall cele∣brate matrimony between any persons without a faculty or licence, except the banes have been first published, as directed by the book of common prayer, upon pain of suspension for three years; nor shall any minister, under the like pain, join any persons in marri∣age who are so licensed, at any unseasonable times, or in a private place, &amp;<HI>c.

<P>And on granting of licences for marriage, <HI>Affidavit</HI> or oath is to be first made before one of the doctors of the commons, by the man, that he and the woman live at such a place, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and are willing to marry each other; that there is no impediment of pre∣contract, consanguinity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or any suit depending in any eccle∣siastical court, touching any contract of marriage of either of the parties with any other, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And then a <HI>Bond</HI> is entered into, to the like effect, as to there being no impediment of precontract, or

<P>Upon a promise of future marriage, if the parties afterwards lie together, it has been adjudged, the contract passes thereby into a real marriage, in construction of law: and by <HI>Holt</HI> Ch. Just. If a contract be in words of future time, as, <HI>I will take thee,</HI> &amp;c. and the man does take her accordingly, and cohabit with her, 'tis a marriage, and the spiritual court cannot punish them for fornica∣tion.

<P>When the words of a contract of marriage are, <HI>I will take thee from henceforth,</HI> &amp;c.

And it is not necessary that both parties use the same words; for if one say, I will marry thee, and the other answers, I am content, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> hereby spousals <HI>de futuro</HI> are con∣tracted: also where a man says to a woman, I promise to marry thee, and if thou art contented to have me, kiss me, or give me thy hand; if the woman do kiss, or give her hand, by this spousals will be contracted between them. <HI>Swinb.</HI> 220.</P>

consent to the contract: and where the promise of a man is proved, but no actual promise on the woman's side; if she carry herself as one consenting and approving the promise of the man, it is evi∣dence that the woman likewise promised. I case a ring be solemnly delivered by a man, and put on the woman's fourth finger; if she accepts and wears the ring, without any words, they are presumed to have mutually consented to marriage; here, as his consent appears, so her's is implied. <HI>Swinb.</HI> 69, 210. 3 <HI>Salk.</HI> 16.</P>
<P>In marriage contracts, it is not absolutely required, that the par∣ties do it at the same instant, by answering one another; but if there be some distance of time betwixt the promise of the man and the woman, the contract may be good, if the party first promis∣ing continues in the same mind until the other party hath promised: but where the parties are under age to consent, it is not matrimo∣ny, but spousals, if it be either; and when the words of contract are only conditional on one side, and on the other absolute; or if spoken in jest, they are not obligatory.</P>
<P>A contract of marriage may be made by absent parties, by their proctors, by messengers, or letters; when by proxy, it is by spe∣cial power of attorney, to contract matrimony or spousals for the party in his name, with such a woman, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And in this case, the proctor says, <HI>That such a man doth contract matrimony with thee, by me his proctor,</HI> &amp;c.

</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. Elopement is where a woman that is married of her own ac∣cord goes away and departs from her husband, and lives with an adulterer.</P>
<P>A woman thus leaving her husband is said to elope; and in this case the husband is not obliged to allow her any alimony or main∣tenance out of his estate; nor shall he be chargeable for necessa∣ries for her, as wearing apparel, diet, lodging, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And where the same is notorious, whoever gives her credit, doth it at his pe∣ril: but on an elopement, the putting a wife in the <HI>Gazette,</HI> or other news papers, is no legal notice to persons in general not to trust her; though personal notice to particular persons given by the husband will be good, not to be chargeable to them. <HI>Rol. Abr.</HI> 350. <HI>Vent.</HI> 42.</P>
<P>If a woman elopes, and the husband gives publick notice of it, and declares he will not pay any debts of hers she contracts; it hath been held, that if persons trust her afterwards the husband is not liable to satisfy the debt: yet according to the opinion of chief justice <HI>Holt,</HI> if a wife run away from her husband, and contract debts, and afterwards the husband comes after her and lies with her, though but for a night; that will make him chargeable for the debts of the wife. <HI>Sid.</HI> 109. <HI>Mod. Rep.</HI> 124. 6 <HI>Mod.</HI> 171.</P>
<P>Where the wife goes away from her husband, and liveth in adultery with another, she shall lose and forfeit her dower; unless the husband of his own free will suffer her to cohabit with him, and be reconciled to his wife. But to prove the reconciliation, on such an elopement, lying together several nights, at several places, it is said shall not avail; if they are not resident or abiding in one house together, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> If after the elopement of the wife, her hus∣band

and she demean themselves as husband and wife, it is evidence of reconciliation. <HI>Dy.</HI> 270, 196.</P>
<P>If a man gran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s his wife with her goods to another man, and the wife by virtue of the grant lives with the grantee during the life of the husband, this shall incur forfeiture of dower; for she lived in adultery, notwithstanding the grant. 2 <HI>Inst.</HI> 435. 2 <HI>Danv. Abr.</HI> 662.</P>
<P N="2">2. Divorce is a separation of two persons married together, made by law: and there are many divorces mentioned in our books, but they are usually of two kinds, <HI>i. e. a Mensa &amp; Thoro,</HI> from bed and board; and <HI>a Vinculo Matrimonii,</HI> from the very bond of marriage. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 235.</P>
<P>The divorce <HI>a Mensa &amp; Thoro</HI> dissolves not the marriage; for the cause of it is subsequent, and supposes the marriage to be law∣ful: it may be by reason of adultery in either of the parties, for cruelty of the husband, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and as it doth not dissolve the marri∣age, so it debars not the woman of her dower; nor bastardizes issue; or makes void any estate for the life of husband and wife, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> A woman under this divorce may sue her husband in her own name for alimony, and others by her next friend, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The di∣vorce <HI>a Vinculo Matrimonii</HI> absolutely dissolveth the marriage, and makes it void from the beginning, the causes thereof being prece∣dent to the marriage; as precontract with some other person, con∣sanguinity or affinity, impotency, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> On this divorce dower is gone: and if by reason of precontract, consanguinity or affinity, the children begotten between them are bastards. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 235. 3 <HI>Inst.</HI> 89. 2 <HI>Inst.</HI> 93. 7 <HI>Rep.</HI> 43.</P>
<P>In these last kind of divorces, the wife, 'tis said, shall receive all again that she brought with her, because the nullity of the marri∣age arises through some impediment, and the goods of the wife were given for her advancement in marriage, which now c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aseth: but here it is where the goods are not spent, and in case the hus∣band gives them away during the coverture, it shall bind her. If she knows her goods unspent, she may bring action of detinue for them; and for money, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which cannot be known, she must sue in the spiritual court: by this divorce an estate-tail of baron and feme, it has been held, may be extinct. <HI>Dy.</HI> 62. <HI>Nels. Abr.</HI> 675. <HI>Godb.</HI> 18.</P>
<P>If after a divorce <HI>a Mensa &amp; Thoro,</HI> either of the parties marry again, the other being living, such marrige is merely void; and as in this case the marriage continues, marrying again hath been adjudged within the statute 1 <HI>Jac.</HI> 1. of felony; where a woman was so divorced, and inhibited, by the sentence not to marry du∣ring her husband's life: On a divorce <HI>a Vinculo Matrimonii,</HI> the
<PB N="214" REF="010935_0110_0F852C06650B13F8"/>
parties may marry again; and in divorces for adultery, several acts of parliament have allowed the innocent party to marry again. 2 <HI>Leon.</HI> 137. <HI>Cro. Car.</HI> 333.</P>
<P>If a marriage is voidable by divorce, yet if the husband dies be∣fore any divore, the wife <HI>de facto</HI> shall be endowed: and where there is a divorce, the children of a second marriage may inherit until the sentence is repealed. Sentence of divorce must be given in the Spiritual Court, in the life of the parties, and not after∣wards; but it may be repealed there after their deaths. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 33. 2 <HI>Leon.</HI> 207.</P>
<P N="3">3. Where any persons married do marry any other person, the former husband or wife being alive, it is felony: but if a husband or wife are abroad beyond sea, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> seven years, the one not know∣ing the other to be living; or there be a divorce of the husband and wife, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they are excepted out of the act. As the latter marriage makes this crime; if the first marriage were beyond sea, and the second in <HI>England,</HI> the party may be indicted for it here: though if the first marriage be in <HI>England,</HI> and the latter beyond sea, the offender cannot be indicted there. <HI>Stat.</HI> 1 <HI>Jac. c.</HI> 11. <HI>Kel.</HI> 79, 80. <HI>Sid.</HI> 171. <HI>H.

<P>To steal or take away any woman, having an estate in lands or goods, or that is heir apparent, against her will, and marry or defile her, is felony by statute: and it is the same, if the taking be against her will, though the marriage was with her consent. And not only the takers, but the procurers, abetters and receivers of the woman before the fact, so taken away, knowing the same, shall be deemed principal felons. 3 <HI>H.</HI> 7. <HI>c.</HI> 2. 39 <HI>Eliz. c.</HI> 9.</P>

<P N="1">1. Bastardy signifies a defect of birth, objected to one born out of wedlock: for a bastard is he that is born of any woman not married, so that his father is not known by the order of law; and therefore he shall not be heir, or of kin to any person; he being
<PB N="215" REF="010935_0110_0F852C06650B13F8"/>
the first of his family; nor shall he have heirs, but of his own body.</P>
<P>A woman is with child by a man, who afterwards marries her, and then the child is born; the child is not a bastard: but if a man hath issue by a woman before marriage, and after they marry, the issue is a bastard by our law; but legitimate by the civil law. In case one marries a wowan grosly big with child by another, and within three days after she is delivered, in our law the issue is no bastard; 'tis otherwise by the spiritual law: and where a child is born within a day after marriage between parties of full age, if there be no apparent impossibility that the husband should be the father of it, the child is not a bastard, but supposed to be the husband's child. 2 <HI>Inst.</HI> 96. <HI>Danv. Abr.</HI> 729. <HI>Rol. Abr.</HI> 358.</P>
<P>But if the husband be but eight or nine years of age, or if he be within the age of fourteen, the issue is a bastard: so where a husband is gelt, or hath lost his genitals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which shews an im∣possibility to get a child; but it must be by special matter. By the common law, if the husband be within the four seas, so that by intendment he may converse with his wife, and the wife hath is∣sue, the child will not be a bastard: but he is a bastard who is born of a woman when her husband is over sea, at and from the time of the begetting to the birth of such child. Where a woman lives in adultery with another, her children by such other are ba∣stards; for they are born out of the limits of matrimony; though if husband and wife consent to live separate, the children born after such separation shall be taken to be legitimate, and not ba∣stards, because the access of the husband shall be presumed. Issue of a second wife or husband, the first being living, is a bastard. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 244. <HI>Danv. Abr.</HI> 729. <HI>Salk.</HI> 122. 2 <HI>Salk.</HI> 483.

<P>It hath been held, that if a woman hath a child forty weeks and eight days after the death of her husband, it shall be legitimate; the law having appointed no exact certain time for the birth of le∣gitimate issues. And here, if a woman great with child by a for∣mer husband, shall marry another man after his death, the child shall be the lawful child of the first husband; but if the woman be privily with child, it shall belong to the second husband. Where any woman says she is with child by a deceased husband, and with∣holds lands from the heir, a writ <HI>Ventre inspiciendo</HI> is to be granted to search her, and try it by a jury of women; and if it be found,
<PB N="216" REF="010935_0111_0F852C071E6572C8"/>

<P>Bastards having gotten names by reputation, may purchase by such names to them and their heirs: and a limitation to them when <HI>in esse,</HI> and known, is good, but not before they are born: they may not take by the name of issue, which must be lawful; nor shall a use be raised to such a reputed son, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Special bastar∣dy is triable by the country, in the temporal courts: but general bastardy, whether a person is a bastard or not, and was born in lawful matrimony, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> upon some question of inheritance, is try'd by the bishop's certificate; after issue joined in a court of law, it is to be transmitted to the ecclesiastical court, to be examin∣ed and certified, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But the judges shall not award a writ to the ordinary to certify bastardy, 'till proclamation is issued for all persons having interest therein to make their objections before him against the party, <HI>&amp;c.

<P>By statutes the two next justices of peace may take order for punishing of the mother and father of a common bastard, and for relief of the parish where born, by a weekly payment, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And the father and mother not obeying the order, shall be imprisoned. And where a bastard child is born, churchwardens may seize goods of the reputed father and mother, to discharge the parish: the justices are to send lewd women, having bastards, to the house of correction; but persons able to keep them are not within the sta∣tute; and a mother discharging the parish shall no be punished.

<HEAD>The Hebeas Corpus statute made in the 31st year of K. Charles II.</HEAD>
<Q><P>THERE having been great delays used by sheriffs, gaolers, and other officers, to whose custody the king's subjects had been committed, in making returns of writs of <HI>Habeas Cor∣pus,</HI> &amp;c. whereby many persons had been long detained in pri∣son, in such cases where by law they were bailable; for preventi∣on thereof, and the more speedy relief of all persons imprisoned for any criminal matters, it is enacted,</P>
<P>I. That whensoever any writ of <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> shall be brought and served upon any officer, or other person for any one in his custody, or shall be left at the gaol with any of the under-offi∣cers, the said officers or their keepers or deputies, within three days after that, (unless the commitment were for treason or fe∣lony plainly expressed in the warrant of commitment) on pay∣ment of the charges of bringing the prisoner, or tender thereof, to be ascertain'd by the judge or court that awarded the writ, and endorsed on the same, not exceeding 12<HI>d. per</HI> mile, and upon security given by the prisoner's own bond to pay charges of carrying him back, if he be remanded by the court, and that he will not make any escape by the way, shall make return of such writ of <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> and bring the body of the party

committed before the judges or barons of the court from whence the writ shall issue, or to such persons before whom the writ is returnable; and shall certify the true causes of his detainer or imprisonment: but if the place of imprisonment, be beyond twen∣ty miles, and not above one hundred miles off, then ten days is allowed for the same; and if further, it shall be within twen∣ty days, and no longer.</P>
<P>II. And persons committed or detained for any crime (unless for treason or felony expressed in the warrant as aforesaid) in the va∣cation-time, may complain to the lord chancellor or keeper, or any judge, who upon view of the copy of commitment, or oath of its being denied, shall upon request by such persons, or any in their behalf, attested and subscribed by two witnesses, grant a <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> under the seal of their respective courts, returnable im∣mediately; and on service thereof, the officer within the times before limited is to bring up such prisoner before the said lord chan∣cellor or judges, before whom the writ is made returnable, with the causes of his commitment; and thereupon, within two days after he shall be brought up, the prisoner shall be discharged from his imprisonment, on entering into recognizance with one or more sureties, to appear in the court of king's bench the term following, or at the next assises, sessions or general gaol delivery, or such other court for the county where the offence is cogniza∣ble; into which court the writ, return and recognizance afore∣said, shall be certified; unless it shall appear that the party is detained upon a legal process or warrant, for such matters or of∣fences which are not bailable by law.</P>
<P>III. Provided always, that if any person shall neglect to pray a <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> for his inlargement, by the space of two terms after he is committed, he shall not have any such writ in time of vacation, in pursuance of this act.</P>
<P>IV. If any officer or officers shall refuse to make their returns, or to bring the body of the prisoner as aforesaid, according to the command of the writ, within the times aforesaid; or upon demand made by the prisoner, or any in his behalf, shall refuse to deliver a true copy of the warrant of commitment, within six hours after demanded, such officers, gaolers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in whose cus∣tody the prisoner shall be detained, shall forfeit for the first offence 100 <HI>l.</HI> and for the second offence 200 <HI>l.</HI> to the party grieved, and be rendered incapable to hold their offices: the penalties to be recovered by action of debt, bill, plaint or information, in any of the king's courts at <HI>Westminster,</HI> wherein no essoin, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or stay of prosecution shall be admitted or allowed.</P>
<P>V. And no person, who shall be delievered and set at large by
<PB N="235" REF="010935_0120_0F852C0DDA6EA9A0"/>
<HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> shall be again imprisoned for the same offence, by any person other than by legal order and process of such court, wherein he shall be bound by recognizance to appear, or other court having jurisdiction of the cause: and if any other persons shall knowingly imprison again the person delivered or set at large, they shall forfeit to the prisoner 500<HI>l.</HI> to be reco∣vered as aforesaid.</P>
<P>VI. Persons committed for high treason or felony, plainly and especially expressed in the warrant, upon prayer in open court the first week of the term, or first day of the sessions of <HI>Oyer</HI> &amp; <HI>Terminer</HI> or gaol-delivery, to be brought to trial; if they are not indicted the next term, sessions of <HI>Oyer</HI> &amp; <HI>Terminer,</HI> or gaol-delivery after such commitment, the judges, upon motion made in court the last day of the term or sessions, shall set them at liber∣ty upon bail, unless it appear upon oath, that the king's witnesses could not be produced that term or sessions: and if any such persons committed as aforesaid, upon such prayer aforesaid, shall not be indicted and tried the second term or sessions after com∣mitment, they shall be discharged from their imprisonment.</P>
<P>VII. But nothing in this act shall extend to discharge out of prison any person charged in debt or other action, or with process in any civil cause, but that after his acquittal for his crime, he shall be kept in custody for such other suits.</P>
<P>VIII. If any person or persons, subjects of this realm, shall be committed to any prison, or be in custody of any officer, for any criminal matter, the said person shall not be removed from the said custody into the custody of any other officer; unless it be by <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> or some other legal writ, or where the prisoner is delivered to the constable to be carried to gaol, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or when any person is sent by order to the house of correction, or removed from one prison to another in the same county, in or∣der to a trial or discharge; or in case of sudden fire, infection or other necessity. And persons making out and signing any war∣rants for removal, contrary hereto, or counter-signing the same, and the officers obey or executing them, shall incur the forfei∣tures before mentioned, both for the first and second offence, to the party grieved.</P>
<P>IX. And any prisoner may move for and obtain his <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> as well out of the <HI>Chancery</HI> or <HI>Exchequer,</HI> as out of the courts of <HI>King's Bench</HI> or <HI>Common Pleas;</HI> and if the lord chan∣cellor or any judge or baron, shall deny any writ of <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> required to be granted as aforsaid, they shall forfeit to the party grieved 500<HI>l.</HI> recoverable in manner aforesaid.</P>
<P>X. And it is declared, that writs of <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> may run

into any county palatine, the cinque ports, and other privileged places of <HI>England,</HI> and into the isles <HI>Jersey</HI> or <HI>Guernsey.</HI></P>
<P>XI. No subject of this realm shall be sent prisoner into <HI>Scot∣land, Ireland,</HI> or into any parts beyond the seas, which are or may be within or without the dominions of his majesty, his his heirs or successors: and if any of the said subjects be so im∣prisoned, it is illegal, and every such person shall for such im∣prisonment have an action of false imprisonment against him by whom he shall be committed, detained, imprisoned, sent prisoner or transported, and against all persons that shall frame, contrive, write, seal or countersign any warrant for such commitment, or shall be advising, aiding or assisting in the same; and shall have judgment to recover treble costs, besides damages, which da∣mages shall not be less than 500<HI>l.</HI> in which action no delay or stop of proceedings, nor no injunction, protection or privilege, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> shall be allowed; and the person or persons so offending as afore∣said, being lawfully convicted thereof, shall be disabled to bear any office of trust or profit within the realm, or dominions thereunto belonging, and incur the pains, penalties and forfeitures ordained by the statute of <HI>Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emunire</HI> made in the 16th year of <HI>Richard</HI> II. and be incapable of any pardon from the king, his heirs or successors.</P>
<P>XII. This act shall not extend to any person who by contract in writing shall agree with any merchant or owner of a plantati∣on, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to be transported, and shall have received earnest upon such agreement: nor to persons convicted of felony, and pray∣ing to be transported beyond the seas, who may be so transported into any parts notwithstanding this statute; nor to the imprison∣ment of any person before the time limited for the commence∣ment of the act, or any thing thereto relating; nor to persons resident in this realm, that shall have committed any capital crime in <HI>Scotland</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI> &amp;c. but that such persons may be sent to receive trial as before this act.</P>
<P>XIII. And persons offending against this act shall not be im∣pleaded for any offence, unless the same be done within two years at most after the offence was committed, in case the party griev∣ed shall not be then in prison; and if he shall be in prison, then within two years after his delivery out of prison or decease.</P>
<P>XIV. After the assizes proclaimed for any county, no person shall be removed from the common gaol upon any <HI>Habeas Cor∣pus,</HI> pursuant to this act, but shall be brought thereupon before the judge of assize in open court: but after the assizes are end∣ed, any person detained may have a <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> according to the direction and intention of the act.</P>

XV. If any information, suit or action, he brought against any person or persons for offences against this law, the defendants may plead the general issue, and give the special matter in evi∣dence; and the said matter shall be as available to all intents, as if they had pleaded or alledged the same matter in bar or dis∣charge of such information, suit or action.</P>
<P>XVI. Persons appearing to be committed as accessary before the fact, to any petit treason or felony, or upon suspicion there∣of, which shall be specially expressed in the warrant of commit∣ment, shall not be removed or bailed by virtue of this act, or in any other manner than they might have been before the making of the same.</P></Q>
<P>Two things I shall observe upon this statute:</P>
<P N="1">1. That altho' the constable by his own authority, without any warrant of commitment, may carry an offender to gaol, and this was the method of securing prisoners, before that there were any justices of the peace; yet since the institution of that magistrate, it is better that they be carried before him, to be sent by him to gaol by warrant of commitment; otherwise they have a right to be bailed upon this act, whatever the offence may be.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the warrant of commitment ought to set forth the cause specially: that is to say, not for treason or felony in general, but treason <HI>for counterfeiting the king's coin,</HI> or felony <HI>for stealing the goods of such a one to such a value,</HI> and the like; that so the court may judge thereupon, whether or no the offence is such, for which a prisoner ought to be admitted to bail. <HI>Burn's Just. qto.</HI> 104.</P>

<P>Coroners are to be men of good ability, and have lands in see in the county where chosen, to answer all people; and if insuffi∣cient, the county shall answer for them: there are also special coroners, within divers liberties, as well as the ordinary officers in every county; as the coroner of <HI>the Verge,</HI> which is a certain compass about the king's court, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and some corporations and colleges are licensed by charter to appoint their coroners within their own precincts. 2 <HI>Inst.</HI> 174. 4 <HI>Inst.</HI> 271.</P>

<P>A justice of peace has no need to shew his commission, when he justifieth the doing things as a justice; for the commission re∣mains with the <HI>Custos Rotulorum</HI> of the county, and he is called by commission in open assise, or sessions.

<P>Justices in their sessions, might originally hear and determine fe∣lonies; but they at this time only try petty larcenies, other felo∣nies being of course tried at the assises: but out of sessions they commit all felons in order to trial; and it is incident to the office of justices of peace, to commit offenders; they also bind over pro∣secutors, to the assises, take and certify examinations and informa∣tions, recognizances, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and if they neglect their duty herein, they shall be fined. A justice may commit a person that doth a fe∣lony in his own view, without warrant; but if it be on the infor∣mation of another, he must make a warrant under hand and seal for that purpose: and if a justice issues his warrant to arrest a fe∣lon, tho' the accusation be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alse, the justice is excused where a fe∣lony is committed; but in case there be no accusation, action will lie against the justice. <HI>Dalt. c.</HI> 11. 2 <HI>Leon.</HI> 187.</P>

<P N="5">5. A constable is an officer over a hundred or in a parish, for preservation of the peace; there being two sorts of these officers, high constables, and petty constables.</P>
<P>The statute of <HI>Winchester,</HI> 13 <HI>Ed.</HI> 1. <HI>c.</HI> 6. appoints for conser∣vation of the peace, two constables in every hundred, called high constables; and continuance of time, and increase of people and

offences, hath under these made others necessary in every town, called petty constables; which are of like nature, but of inferior authority to the others, and are as it were assistants to them: also there are other officers in towns and parishes, as headboroughs, tithingmen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and where there is no constable, their duty is the same; but they seem generally to be for particular boroughs, tith∣ings and villages. <HI>Dalt.</HI> 3.</P>
<P>It is said, constables were conservators of the peace before jus∣tices of the peace were made; but some of our law books mention that constables were only subordinate officers to the conservators of the peace, as they are now to the justices. In places where head∣boroughs are appointed, they are a kind of constables, though constables are the principal officer; and there are some things which a constable has power to do, that headboroughs and tith∣ingmen cannot intermeddle with: indeed in the absence of the constable, they are chiefly to attend the service of the office; and in a town or parish, having no other parish officer, the tithing∣man, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is in effect the constable of the place. <HI>Dalt.</HI> 3. <HI>Owen</HI> 105.</P>
<P>Anciently high and petty constables were appointed by the she∣riff in his tourn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and sworn there, as well as in the leet: a con∣stable of common right is to be chosen by the jury in the court-leet; and if he be present, and refuse to be sworn in his office, the steward may fine him: if he is absent when elected, he shall be sworn before justices of peace; and then if such constable re∣fuse to be sworn, and to take upon him the office, the homage must present his refusal at the next court, and there he shall be a∣merced. At the court-leet a high constable may be chosen by the steward, on presentment of the jury, where custom warrants it; but where such courts are not kept, or there is a neglect in chu∣sing him, the justices at their quarter-sessions may chuse and swear a high constable: and he may be sworn out of sessions, by war∣rant from thence. <HI>Salk.</HI> 175.</P>
<P>If constables, headboroughs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> die, or go out of the parish, or in case of refusal to serve the office, two justices of peace are to swear new ones, 'till the lord of the manor hold a court-leet, or until the next quarter sessions, and then the steward or justices may either approve of them, or appoint others to continue in for one year; and if any of them continue above a year, the justices of peace may discharge them, and put in others until the lord of the manor holds a court. <HI>Stat.</HI> 13 <HI>&amp;</HI> 14 <HI>Car.</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 12.</P>
<P>All constables are appointed yearly: the high constables are now generally chosen and sworn by the justices at their sessions; and petty constables and tithingmen, in each town, parish or vill,
<PB N="260" REF="010935_0133_0F852C1E5BEC0A70"/>
and choice of them properly belongs to the court-leet; but they may be elected by the parishioners, and sworn by a justice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who on just cause may remove them. A village having no constable, the justices of peace, by order of sessions, appointed one to serve there: for justices have always exercised a power of appointing constables: and they are officers to the justices of peace, as the sheriff is to the court of King's Bench. 4 <HI>Inst.</HI> 267. <HI>Salk.</HI> 175, 176.</P>
<P>The persons elected to this office ought to be men of honesty, knowledge and ability; not infants, lunaticks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and they are to be men of substance, and not of the meaner sort, also shall be resident where chosen; and if they be not thus qualified, upon complaint, two justices may appoint other persons. But physici∣ans, apothecaries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are excused by statute from bearing the office of constable, or other parish offices; and justices of peace, attornies and officers of the courts at <HI>Westminster,</HI> barristers at law, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are privileged from serving this office; and poor, old, sick and decrepit persons, are exempted from it. 8 <HI>Rep.</HI> 41. 5 <HI>Mod.</HI> 96. 2 <HI>Hawk.

<P>A constable may make a deputy; but the constable is answer∣ble for him, and the deputy must be sworn: and constables may appoint a deputy, or person to execute a warrant▪ when by reason of sickness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they cannot do it themselves. Dissenters chosen to the office of a constable, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> scrupling to take the oaths, are to make deputies for the execution of the office, who shall com∣ply with the law in this behalf: and a woman made constable, by virtue of a custom, that the inhabitants of a town shall serve by turns, on account of their estates or houses, may hire one to exe∣cute the office for her, and the custom is good. <HI>Sid.</HI> 355. 2 <HI>Hawk.</HI> 63. 1 <HI>W. &amp; M. c.</HI> 18.</P>

<P>The duty and office of <HI>Petty Constables,</HI> in their several towns, parishes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is generally much the same as the high constable's in his hundred: these officers are to keep the peace; and as con∣servators thereof, they may command affrayers to depart, &amp;c. and not ceasing, but making resistance may put them in the stocks, 'till they can carry them before some justice, or to the gaol; and may break into a house to see the peace kept; make fresh pursuit into another county, &amp;c. They may command all persons to assist them, to prevent a breach of the peace; justify beating another, if as∣saulted; and if they happen to be killed, doing their duty, it will be taken to be premeditated murder: they may without any war∣rant from a justice of peace, take into custody any persons whom they see committing a felony, or breach of the peace; tho' if it be out of their sight, as where a person is seized by another, &amp;c. they may do it without a justice's warrant.

of the county; and a constable by his original authority, for breach of the peace, and some misdemeanors that are not felony, may imprison a man. But 'tis safest and best, to bring offenders to a justice, who, as the cause shall require, will either bail or commit them to prison. Constables may not lawfully take up night-walkers, on bare suspicion only of their being of ill fame; if they are not found breaking the peace, or doing some unlawful act, &amp;c.

<P>One part of the office of constables is attendance upon judges of assize, justices of peace at their general and special sessions, and other meetings, to execute warrants, and present offences upon oath; and they must attend at courts-leet, and on coroners, for executing warrants, &amp;c. Petty constables are to execute the warrants of justices, and not dispute it where the justices hath jurisdiction, and the warrant is lawful: and being sworn officers, they need not shew their warrants when they come to arrest any one. But if the justice's warrant doth not set forth the special matter therein, it is unlawful; and if a justice of peace sends a warrant to a constable to take up one for slander, &amp;c. the justice having no jurisdiction in such cases, the constable ought not to execute it; if he does, he is liable to action of false imprison∣ment. 10 <HI>Rep.</HI> 76. 2 <HI>Inst.</HI> 291. 2 <HI>Danv.

<P>As the constable is the proper officer to a justice of peace, and bound to execute his lawful warrant; if a warrant be directed to any constable by name, commanding him to execute the same, though he is not compellable to go out of his own parish, yet he may if he will, and execute it in any place in the county, and shall be justified by the warrant for his so doing; but if the war∣rant is directed to all constables, &amp;c. generally, no constable can make execution of it out of his precinct. <HI>Salk.</HI> 175.</P>
<P>By warrant from a justice, a constable shall sell the goods of an offender apprehended to discharge the expence of carrying him to gaol: if he hath no goods, then the town, where he was taken, must be at the expence, and the constable, with three or four of the principal inhabitants, may impose a tax on every inhabitant, &amp;c. which being allowed by a justice of peace, the constable by his warrant may levy it: and if the inhabitants refuse to make a <HI>Rate,</HI> two justices may by their warrant compel them to it. <HI>Stat.</HI> 3 <HI>Jac. c.</HI> 10.</P>

<P><HI>Treason</HI> is defined to be an offence committed against the secu∣rity of the king and kingdom: at common law there were different opinions concerning high treason, and before the statute 25 <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d.</HI> 3. it was a very uncertain crime; for the killing of the king's brother or even his messenger, was taken to be included in it; so when acts tended to diminish the dignity of the crown, and where a man grew popular, this was construed to be incroaching royal power, and held to be treason: but since the making that act, there can be no constructive treason. <HI>Hawk.

To compass or imagine the death of the king, queen or their eldest son and heir, is high treason: though it must be manifested by some overt act; as by providing arms to do it, consulting to levy war against him, writ∣ing letters to excite others to join therein, assembling persons in order to imprison or depose the king, or to get him into their power, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> these acts are sufficient to prove that one compassed or imagined the death of the king, and to a man guilty of high treason. 3 <HI>Inst.</HI> 6, 12.</P>
<P>It was formerly held that compassing by bare words, is not an overt-act to make this crime treason; but it hath been adjudged, that words are an overt-act: such deliberate words as shew a di∣rect purpose against the king's life, will amount to an overt-act of compassing or imagining the king's death; for as the compassing or imagining the death of the king is the treason, words are the most natural way of expressing the imagination of the heart, and may be good evidence of it: and any external act, which may be a manifestation of such imagination, is an overt-act. But if words are set down in writing, and kept privately in a man's closet, they are no overt-act of treason, except the words are published. <HI>Cro. Car.</HI> 242. <HI>Hawk. P. C.</HI> 40, 41. <HI>Kel.</HI> 20.</P>
<P>Words of persuasion to kill the king, are overt-acts of compas∣ing his death; and it is held, that he who intendeth by force to prescribe laws to the king, and to restrain him of his power, doth intend to deprive him of his crown and life: that if a man be ig∣norant of the intention of those who take up arms against the king, if he joins in any action with them, he is guilty of treason: and that the law judges every rebellion to be a plot against the king's life, and a deposing him; because a rebel would not suffer that king to reign and live, who will punish him for rebellion. <HI>Moor</HI> 620.</P>
<P>Under the head of compassing and imagining the king's death, intention of treason proved by circumstances is punished as high treason: and men's actions are governed by their intentions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 5 <HI>Mod.</HI> 206.</P>

<P>Persons raising forces for any publick end or purpose, and put∣ting themselves in a posture of war, by chusing leaders, and re∣sisting constables, or the guards, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is high treason: and those who make an insurrection in order to redress a publick grievance, whether it be a real or pretended one, are said to levy war against the king, though they have no direct design against his person. Where great numbers by force endeavour to remove certain per∣sons from the king, or to lay violent hands on a privy counsellor, or revenge themselves against a magistrate for executing his office; or to deliver men out of prison or reform religion or the law, to pull down all bawdy-houses, or throw down all inclosures in gene∣ral, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> these acts will be high treason: But where a number of men rise to remove a grievance to their private interest; as to pull down a particular inclosure, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they are only rioters. <HI>Sid.</HI> 358. 5 <HI>Inst.</HI> 9. <HI>Kel.</HI> 75. <HI>Hawk.

<P>If two or more conspire to levy war and one of them alone raises forces; this shall be adjudged treason in all. And not only such as directly rebel and take up arms against the king; but also those who in a violent manner withstand his lawful authority, or attempt a reformation of his government, do levy war against him: and therefore to hold a fort or castle against the king's forces; to keep together armed men in great numbers, against the king's express commands, have been held treason. <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> 98. 3 <HI>Inst.</HI> 10.</P>
<P>But if where a rebellion is broke out, persons join themselves to rebels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for fear of death, and return the first opportunity, they are not guilty of this offence. <HI>Kel.</HI> 76.</P>
<P N="3">3. To adhere to the king's enemies within his realm, or give them aid in the realm, or elsewhere, is treason by the statute: here adherence may be proved by giving the king's enemies com∣fort or relief, or being in counsel with others to levy any seditious wars; and the delivery or surrender of the king's castles or forts, by the captains thereof, to the king's enemy, within the realm or without, for reward, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is an adhering to the king's enemies, and high treason by 25 <HI>Ed.</HI> 3.</P>
<P>It has been adjudged, that adhering to the king's enemies is an adhering against him; and this adhering to the enemies of the king out of the realm will be treason: one who was beyond sea, having solicited a foreign prince to invade the kingdom, was held guilty of high treason, and triable by the Stat. 35 <HI>H.</HI> 8. <HI>c.</HI> 2.

king's enemies, but traitors; and if a subject join with a foreign enemy, and come into <HI>England</HI> with him; if he be taken prisoner, he shall not be ransomed, or proceeded against as an enemy, but as a traitor to the king: but an enemy coming in open hostility into this kingdom and taken, shall be either executed by martial law, or ransomed; for he cannot be indicted of treason, because he never was within the allegiance of the king. 3 <HI>Inst.</HI> 11.</P>
<P>When one knows that another hath committed treason, and doth not reveal it to the king, or his privy council, or some magistrate, that the offender may be secured, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it is high treason by our ancient law: but there must now be an assent to some outward act, to make concealing it treason. 3 <HI>Inst.</HI> 138.</P>
<P N="4">4. To violate and deflower the king's wife, or eldest daughter unmarried, or the wife of the king's eldest son, are treason within the statute of king <HI>Edw.</HI> III. Also violating the queen's person, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> was high treason at common law, because it destroyed the certainty of the king's issue, and consequently raised contention about the succession. <HI>H. P. C.</HI> 16.</P>
<P>Not only violating the queen consort is high treason, but also her yielding and consenting to it is treason in her; but this doth not extend to a queen dowager: so likewise violating the wife of the prince, is treason only during the marriage. And the eldest daughter of the king is such a daughter as is eldest not married at the time of the violation, which will be treason, altho' there was an elder daughter than her, who died without issue; for now the elder alive has a right to the inheritance of the crown, upon a fai∣lure of issue male. 3 <HI>Inst.</HI> 9.</P>
<P>The treason against the queen's life, mentioned in the statute, must be also during the coverture; and it extendeth not to a dow∣ager queen. <HI>Ibid.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. To counterfeit the king's great seal, privy seal or his money; or bring false money into this kingdom, counterfeited like the money of <HI>England,</HI> to make payment therewith in deceit of the king and his people, these are high treason by the statute of <HI>Ed.</HI> 3.</P>
<P>As to counterfeiting the king's seal, it was treason by the com∣mon law; and the statute 25 <HI>Ed.</HI> 3. mentions only the great seal and privy seal; for the counterfeiting of the sign manuel, or privy signet, is not treason within that act; but by 1 <HI>&amp;</HI> 2 <HI>P. &amp; M. c.</HI> 11. Those who aid and consent to the counterfeiting of the great seal, are equally guilty with the actors; but an intent or going about to counterfeit the great seal, if it be not actually done, is not trea∣son; there must be an actual counterfeiting, and it is to be like the king's great seal. 3 <HI>Inst.</HI> 15. <HI>H. P. C.</HI> 18.</P>
<P>And the fixing the great seal to a patent, without warrant, or

rasing any thing out of a patent, and adding new matter therein; or taking off the wax impressed by the great seal from one patent, and fixing it to another, are not within this law: but here, tho' this be not a counterfeiting, it has been adjudged a misprision of treason of the highest degree. 3 <HI>Inst.</HI> 16. <HI>Kel.</HI> 89.</P>
<P>At common law, <HI>Forging of the king's money</HI> was treason; as counterfeiting it is by the Stat. 25 <HI>Ed.</HI> 3. And forging or coun∣terfeiting foreign money made current here by proclamation, is high treason by 1 <HI>Mar. sess.</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 6. And as those persons that coin money without the king's authority, are guilty of treason; so are those who have authority to do it, if they make it of greater alloy, or less weight, than they ought. In case of bringing coun∣terfeit money into this kingdom, it must be actually counterfeited, according to the likeness of <HI>English</HI> money, and is to be knowing∣ly brought over from some foreign nation, not from any place subject to the crown of <HI>England,</HI> and must be uttered in payment. 3 <HI>Inst.</HI> 17. <HI>H.

<P><HI>Petit Treason</HI> is where one out of malice takes away the life of a subject to whom he owes special obedience; and is called petit treason, in respect to high treason, which is against the king: it may be committed where a servant kills his master, a wife her husband, or a sucular or religious person killeth his prelate or su∣perior. And aiders, abettors and procurers are within the act: but if the killing is upon a sudden falling out, or <HI>se defendendo, &amp;c.</HI> it is not petit treason. 25 <HI>Ed.</HI> 3. <HI>st.</HI> 5. <HI>c.</HI> 2. 3 <HI>Inst.</HI> 20. <HI>H.

<P>This is a crime committed against the head, tho' not against the supreme head; and if a servant kills his mistress or the wife of his master, she is master within the letter of the statute, and it will be petit treason.

<P>If a wife and a stranger kill the husband, it is petit treason in the wife, and murder in the stranger: and where a wife and her servant conspire to kill the husband, and the servant alone in the wife's absence killeth him, it shall be petit treason in both. If the wife procure a servant to kill her husband, both are guilty of petit treason; and if a stranger procures a wife or servant to kill the husband or master, he may be indicted as accessary to petit treason. <HI>Dalt.</HI> 337. <HI>Cromp.</HI> 41. <HI>Dyer</HI> 128, 332.</P>
<P>A maid servant and a stranger conspired to rob the mistress, and in the night the servant opened the door, and let in the stranger into the house, who killed her mistress, she lighting him to her bed, but neither saying nor doing any thing, only holding the candle; and this was held murder in the stranger, and petit treason in the servant. <HI>Dyer</HI> 128.</P>
<P>By our law petit treason implies murder, and is the highest de∣gree thereof: and it is said that in petit treason two witnesses are required to the indictment; but not to the trial of it, for it is not within the statute 7 <HI>W.</HI> 3. <HI>c.</HI> 3. 2 <HI>Hawk. Pl. Cr.</HI> 258.</P>
<P><HI>Murder</HI> is a wilful and felonious killing of a man upon malice forethought; so as the party wounded or hurt die within a year and a day: and if one dies in that time, through disorderly living, it shall be no excuse, the wounds will be judged the principal cause of his death. 3 <HI>Inst.</HI> 53. <HI>H.

He who doth a cruel and voluntary act, whereby death ensues, doth it of malice prepensed and forethought, in the esteem of the law: and if a person in cool blood maliciously and deliberately beats another in such a manner, beyond any apparent intent of

chastisement, that he dieth; it is murder by express malice.

<P>If one lays poison to kill a certain person, and another takes it, and dies; or if having malice to a man, strikes or shoots at him; but misseth him and kills another person; these are murder: and by poisoning, and where one killeth another without provocation, malice is implied. If one resolves to kill the next man he meets, and does kill him, it is murder, though he knew him not; here malice is implied against mankind. Where two persons meet and fight on a precedent quarrel, and one is killed; or if a person upon a sudden quarrel appears to be master of his temper, and kills another, it will be murder: for when persons fight after a former quarrel, it shall be presumed to be out of malice; and if two men fall out in the morning and meet and fight in the after∣noon, if one of them be killed, this is murder; their after-meet∣ing is of malice. If two persons fight a <HI>Duel,</HI> upon some quarrel precedent; and one of them be killed, both principal and seconds are guilty of murder. 3 <HI>Inst.</HI> 51, 52. <HI>Kel.</HI> 27. <HI>Plowd.</HI> 578. <HI>H.

<P>A man being provoked by words or gestures, makes a push at a person before his sword is drawn, and thereupon a fight ensues, wherein he who made the assault kills the other, this will be mur∣der; but if he had made no push, 'till the other's sword was drawn, it would have been only manslaughter in the person killing. And if one upon a quarrel with another tell him that he will not strike first, but will give such other a pot of ale to strike him, and there∣upon the other strikes him, and he kills the other, he is guilty of murder; this being only a covert to his malicious intention. <HI>Kel.</HI> 55, 61. <HI>H P.

And if one upon angry words assault another, by pulling him by the nose, and he that is assaulted draws his sword, and immediately kills the other party, this is only manslaughter; for the peace was first broken by the party killed, and here an indignity was offered to the slayer, from whence he might apprehend that there might be some farther design against him.

2. Larceny is a private felony, against the goods of a man, in his absence; and in respect of the thing stolen, is either great or small: grand larceny is a felonious taking and carrying away the personal goods of another, above the value of 12<HI>d.</HI> not from the person, or by night, in the house of the owner; and petit larce∣ny is when the goods stolen do not exceed the value of 12<HI>d. H. P. C.</HI> 69.</P>
<P>The difference between grand and petit larceny is only the value of the goods: and if two persons steal goods to the value of 13<HI>d.</HI> it is grand larceny in both; and in case one at different times steals divers parcels of goods from the same person, which together ex∣ceed the value of 12<HI>d.</HI> they may be put together in one indict∣ment, and the offender found guilty of grand larceny; tho' this is very seldom done: but on the contrary, the jury sometimes, where it is an offender's first offence, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> find it specially, as they may, that the goods are but 10<HI>d.</HI> value; so as to be only petit larceny, though the offender be indicted for stealing things of the value of 30 or 40<HI>s.</HI> 3 <HI>Inst.</HI> 109. <HI>H. P. C.</HI> 70. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>etl. Rep.</HI> 66.</P>
<P>To make the crime of larceny, there must be a felonious tak∣ing, or an intent of stealing the thing, when it comes first to the hands of the offender, at the very time of the receiving. If a man hath possession of goods once lawfully, though he afterwards carry them away with an ill attention, it is no larceny: where a taylor imbezils cloth delivered to him, to make a suit of clothes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it is no felony; nor is it where a servant goes away with his master's goods delivered to him, which is only a breach of trust, by reason of the delivery; (but by statute they are to be under 40<HI>s.</HI> value:) and if I lend a man a horse to go to a certain place, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> goes there, and then rides away with the horse, it is not larceny. 3 <HI>Inst.</HI> 107. <HI>Dalt.</HI> 367, 369. 5 <HI>Rep.</HI> 13. <HI>H P. C.</HI> 61.</P>
<P>As in these cases, there is a lawful possession by the delivery of the goods, that extenuates the offence; but if one intending to steal goods, get possession of them by ejectment, replevin, or other process at law unduly obtained, by false oath, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it is a felonious taking. And a man may commit larceny, by taking away his own goods, in the hands of another; where the owner delivers goods to a carrier, and afterwards secretly steals them from him, with an intent to charge him for them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> because the carrier had a special property for a time. 3 <HI>Inst.</HI> 108, 64, 110. <HI>Kel.</HI> 43, 44. <HI>Dalt.</HI> 373.</P>

And so when a thief takes the purse of a person, which in a fright he cast into a bush; and where a man endeavouring to escape from a robber drops his hat, &amp;c. which the highwayman takes up, it is a taking from the per∣son: and in case a thief cuts a man's pocket, whereby his purse falls to the ground, if he takes up the same, though he lets it fall again, it is robbery. 3 <HI>Inst.</HI> 60. <HI>Dalt.</HI> 363. <HI>H.

<P>If a robber having taken a person's purse, finding little in it, delivers it back with all the money to the party; 'tis notwithstand∣ing a felonious taking, because he had it in his possession; and the continuance of his possession is not required by law. A person who hath assaulted me, drives my cattle in my presence out of my pasture; or robs my servant of my money or other thing before my face, he may be indicted as having taken such things from my person; for when a servant is robbed, in the sight of his master, of his master's goods, it is adjudged a robbery of the master. Not only the taking away a horse, which a man is actually riding, is robbery; but if the horse be standing by him, and taken against his will, it is in law a taking from the person; and a claim of pro∣perty, without colour for it, will not excuse it: but if one leaves his horse tied, and steps aside; or if a carrier follows his horses at a distance, and they are taken away, this is not such a taking to

<P><HI>Rape</HI> is an unlawful and carnal knowledge of a woman, by force and against her will: a ravishment of the body, and violent deflowering her, which is felony by the common and statute law.

<P>In rapes, it is no excuse or mitigation of the crime, that the woman at last yielded to the violence, and consented either after the fact or before, if such her consent was forced by fear of death, or of imprisonment; or that she was a common strumpet, for she is still under the protection of the law, and may be forced: but it is said by some to be evidence of a woman's consent, that she was a common whore.

<P>It was formerly adjudged not to be rape to force a woman, who conceived at the time; because if she had not consented, she could not conceive: though this opinion hath been since questioned, by reason the previous violence is no way extenuated by such a subse∣quent consent.

<P>Tho' a woman ravished may prosecute, and be a witness in her own cause; yet a woman's positive oath of a rape, without con∣curring circumstances, is seldom credited: if a man can prove himself to be in another place, or in other company, at the time she charges him with committing the fact, this will invalidate her oath: so if she is wrong in the description of the place where done, or swears the fact to be committed in such place, to which it was impossible the man could have access at that time; as if the room was then locked up, and the key in the keeping of another person, &amp;c. 3 <HI>Rep.</HI> 37. <HI>Dalt.</HI> 107.</P>
