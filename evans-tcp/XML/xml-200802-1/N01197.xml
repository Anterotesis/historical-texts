<P>JEREMIAH was <HI>One</HI> of those <HI>Many</HI> Prophets, whom God because he had Compassion on his People and Dwelling-place, sent to his People <HI>Israel</HI> grown very Corrupt and Degenerate, to discover their sinful Miscarriages to them, and to urge the Reformation of them, as a means of preventing those fearful Desola∣tions which would otherwise overtake them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Chron.</HI> 36<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>. As his Name, <HI>Jeremiah</HI> signifies, <HI>The Exaltation of the Lord,</HI> So he takes frequent occasion, throughout his Sermons to them, to lay before them an Heart-affecting discovery of the Glo∣rious dispensations of God's Covenant Grace, Mercy, Truth and Faithfulness towards them; and to represent to them
<PB N="2" REF="001429_0004_0FB2F484292C9E70"/>
their abominable transgressions, base, and more than brutish regardlessness of the merciful conduct of God's Providence toward them their slighting, despising, and trampling un∣der foot the repeated Act<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of his favour and kindness, per∣sisting, not withstanding all Warnings, Admonitions and Judgments, spent in vain upon them, in an immorigerous disobedient rebellious and incorrigible frame, proceeding still from worse to worse, hating to be Reformed and re∣fusing to turn unto God, from whom they had so deeply revolted; upon the account whereof, in Obedience to hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lord and Masters Command, he is enforced to Menace them with, and to denounce against them the final and fatal Doom, God had determined upon them; The destruction of their Temple, and City, the dissolution of their Ecclesiasti∣cal, and Civil Polity, the whole issuing in a Miserable and Shameful Captivity, for Seventy years together, the deser∣ved fruit of their incorrigible, and incurable impieties.</P>
<P>The last thing mentioned is the great business the Pro∣phat insists on in this Thirteenth Chapter. The whole Sum of his Excellent Sermon herein contained, may be re∣duced unto three heads.</P>
<P><HI>I.</HI> He threa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ns <HI>Judah</HI> and <HI>Jerusalem</HI> with a fearful de∣struction and doom, which would put an end to those Pro∣batory Methods, God had for a long season been using with them; from the 1<HI>st.</HI> to the 15<HI>th. v.</HI></P>
<P><HI>II.</HI> He earnestly adviseth, and importunes them, by a speedy Repentance and Reformation; the only thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at would Effect it, to prevent and divert the hideous S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>m, of Wrath impending and hanging over their heads, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eady to break forth upon them; from <HI>v.</HI> 15. to 22.</P>
<P><HI>III.</HI> He stands up in the Vindication of the Spotless, and untainted Righteousness of God, Assuring them, they had no reason in the World to dispute the case with God, or to look upon it an unreasonable or unjust thing, for him to threaten them with such a Judgment, as would put a period to the time of their tryal and probation, during the whole of which, all Methods of Grace and Favour, all lesser, and lighter Stroaks of divine Judgments, had proved ineffectu∣al
<PB N="3" REF="001429_0005_0FB2F4866F411F48"/>
to win them over to a Sense of Duty, and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them from their Sinful and Abominable Courses, to which alone, not to a want of Grace, Mercy, Truth, or Faithful∣ness in God, not only all former heats of God's anger they had f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lt, or were still under the Effects, and Tokens of, but also this present threatned destruction were to be re∣puted as wholly owing: from <HI>v.</HI> 22. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI></P>
<P>The Destruction the Prophet in God's Name <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heatens this People with, he is commanded to Exhibit to them by two Types or Emblem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P>The first Type is that of <HI>A Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n Girdle,</HI> which he is Commanded to get, and put upon his Loins; and some time after to hide in the Hole of a Rock, by the River <HI>Eu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rates;</HI> Many days after this, he is Commanded to go to <HI>Eu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rates</HI> to take the Girdle thence. The Prophet performs the En∣joyned Service, whether really, only Visionally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s not determined; but whether the one way or the other<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it comes to one; the Girdle he finds Marr'd and Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yled and good for nothing: this we have from the 1. to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>v-Jeremiah</HI> receives from God himself the Explication of the Type, with a Commission to declare both the Type, and its Explication to the People▪ they must be instructed that God's design by this Type or Emblem, was to le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> know, that God had put a Special Honour and Respect upon them; the like he had not done to any Nation; he had taken them into Covenant with himself; they were made a People hear to God, no wonder then if he Expect Honour and Service from them. They were a People whom God had formed for Himself, and therefore ought to have been for a Name, Praise and Glory to him; but they failed his just Expectation, answered not his design. He is there∣fore resolved to pluck them from his L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ins, and suffer them to consume and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot, and become as that Marred Girdle which was rendred wholly Useless and Unserviceable: from <HI>v. 8. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d 12. v.</HI></P>
<P>The second Type is that of <HI>Bottles filled with Wine.</HI> This the Prophet is ordered to propound to them, <HI>v.</HI> 12. Their Sensual Lusts had no small hand in pulling down Ruin and
<PB N="4" REF="001429_0006_0FB2F487F1B8A728"/>
Destruction upon them. They were a People who lov'd <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons of Wine, H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</HI> 3. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Those were the best Prophets, in their Esteem, who would Prophecy to them of Wine, and Strong Drink, <HI>Mica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> 2. 11. Our Prophet is therefore commanded to tell them, that God had prepared Bottles for them; Bottles▪ every-of which, too, should be filled with Wine. What News could be more pleasing to the Drunk∣ard than this? But alas, the Wine would not be grateful to their Palate; It would be wine of Astonishment and Confusion; all Ranks, Orders and Degrees among them, from him that S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t on the Throne, to the meanest Inhabi∣tant in the Kingdom, must drink of it, and feel the fatal and ruining, and intoxicating consequences of it. The destroying Judgments of Heaven to be Executed upon them by the <HI>Caldeans,</HI> that hasty, and bitter Nation; this was the Wine, They themselves the Bottles to be filled with it; Bottles that must be broken, and dasht in pieces▪ by the hands of divine &amp; righteous Vengeance <HI>v.</HI> 12, 13, 14.</P>
<P>The destruction of this People, we see, is resolved upon, and, in Gods Name, peremptorily denounced; but because in all such threatenings there is a Condition to be under∣stood. <HI>i. e.</HI> Unless Sinners do Repent, and Turn from the Evil of their ways, <HI>Jer.</HI> 18 7, 8. Therefore the Prophet, in the Words of our Text, Subjoyns a Serious and Patheti∣cal Exhortation to stir them up, and quicken them to Con∣fession of, Humiliation for, and to a Speedy Reformation of all the God provoking Evils, in the midst of them, as the only means to divert the fatal Ruin which would otherwise overwhelm them.</P>
<P><HI>Give Glory to the Lord your God, before he cause darkness, and before your feet stumble on the dark Mountains, and while ye look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross darkness.</HI></P>
<P>In the Words; which I shall not stand upon a Critical Analysis of, Two things may be briefly Observed.</P>
<P><HI>I.</HI> An Exhortation. <HI>Give Glory to the Lord,</HI> &amp;<HI>c.</HI> By their giving Glory to the Lord, the Prophet intends their free and full Confession, and Sincere bewailing all their Sins, and
<PB N="5" REF="001429_0007_0FB2F48C7A95E108"/>
all the fearful Aggravations attending them, their Re∣penting of and Turning from all their Iniquities. A bare Confession of Sin, without hearty Sorrow, Repentance, and utmost indeavour to Return and Forsake it, will stand the Sinner in little stead, and will not turn to his advantage: Prov. 28. 13. <HI>He that Covereth his Sins shall not prospe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, but whose confesseth, and forsaketh them, shall have Mercy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>II.</HI> The Illustration of the Exhortation. Divers things claim to be considered here; As▪</P>
<P>I. The Person Exhorting; The Prophet <HI>Jeremiah.</HI> God's Prophets and Ministers must denounce the Judgments of Heaven, against Heav'n daring &amp; offending Sinners. They must cry aloud, and not spare, lift up their Voices like Trumpets, and shew the Lords People their transgressions, and the House of Jacob their Sins, <HI>Isa.</HI> 58. 1. A neglect herein, would argue them of Unfaithfulness to God, and of falseness to their own Souls; and would bring upon them the guilt of the Blood of the Souls of others, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 33. 7, 8. But yet it becomes them to manage this Service, in the most Affectionate and Winning way &amp; manner imaginable. They should indeavour to make Sinners sensible, that altho' they must out of Faithfulness to God, and their precious Souls, denounce the Judgments of God against them, yet they are far from desiring the woful day. It would be the greatest Joy, Pleasure, and Satisfaction to them in the World, might they be made Instrumental to promote their Repentance and Reformation, whereby the anger of God might be appeased, and the final Execution of threatened Judgments diverted.</P>
<P><HI>II.</HI> The Persons concerned in the Exhortation. All Ranks, Orders and Degrees of Men among them. Their Kings, Priests, Prophets, and all the Inhabitants of Jerusa∣lem, <HI>v.</HI> 13. All had been guilty of Provoking God to dis∣pleasure, and therefore it was requisite they should <HI>All</HI> joy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in that necessary duty of Confessing▪ Bewailing, Repenting, and Reforming of their Sins, whereby Gods anger might be Averted, and their final doom Prevented.</P>
<P><HI>III.</HI> The Arguments by which the Exhortation is pressed upon them.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="001429_0008_0FB2F48F4505A8E8"/>
<HI>I.</HI> God was still their God. They might look upon, acknowledge, and plead with God, as a God yet theirs by Covenant. <HI>Give Glory to the Lord your God.</HI> O astonishing and amazing Consideration! O the inconcievable Depths of Covenant Mercy! will God own a Covenant Relation to such a fearful degenerate People? A People whose deeds had over-passed the deeds of the wicked, <HI>Jer</HI> 5. 28. A People who had forsaken the fountain of Living Waters, <HI>Jer.</HI> 2. 13. A Sottish and Foolish People, who were only wise to do Evil, but to do good had no understanding, <HI>Jer.</HI> 4. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>2. A People that were become Brass and Iron, grievous Revolters and Backsliders, <HI>Jer.</HI> 6. 28. A People slidden back by a perpetual backsliding, that held fast de∣ceit, and refused to return, <HI>Jer.</HI> 8, 5. O the surprizing Charms of such an heart affecting and melting Considera∣tion! And this, doubtless our Prophet had in his Eye. His mentioning of this Consideration, was with design to insinuate the Obligation deriving from it. God is as yet your God, and would you have him to continue such; You must then Repent of your Sins, Reform your Evil Ways, humble your selves under his high and mighty Hand▪ Live &amp; Walk in all manner of Obedience to his Holy and Righteous commands; In which way alone you may Expect to have the blessings of the Everlasting Covenant continued and secured to you, and the present Storm of impending wrath diverted from you.</P>
<P><HI>II.</HI> Though the Sentence was pronounced, yet the Execu∣tion was respited. <HI>Before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e cause darkness and before your feet stumble on the dark Mountains. q. d.</HI> Dark dispensations you are threatened with. A dark and black day is hasten∣ing on you; it is coming, it is coming apace, but through the wonderful and astonishing Patience of God it is not yet come; Nothing can prevent its coming but your Repen∣tance, and Reformation. Set about this work therefore with all imaginable speed, for although it be not yet too late, you know not how soon it may. This argument is the same with that the Prophet <HI>Zephaniah</HI> used with his People: Zeph, 2. 1, 2. <HI>Gather your selves together, gather your
<PB N="7" REF="001429_0009_0FB2F49024181CC0"/>
selves together, O Nation not desired. Before the decree bring forth, before the day pass as the Chaff, before the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erce anger of the Lord come upon you, before the day of the Lords Anger come upon you.</HI> And this day he tells them, as our Prophet here, would be a day of Darkness and Gloominess, a day of Clouds and thick darkness, <HI>Zeph.</HI> 1. 15.</P>
<P><HI>III.</HI> It would be a Vain thing for them to hope, this duty neglected, that they should ever emerge out of their pre∣sent Evil Circumstances, or escape the present threatned Storm of Wrath coming upon them. Their false Pro∣phets, indeed, flattered them to presume and lot upon this, and they were but too ready to hug and embrace the de∣ception. But he leaves them to consider what a terrible aggravation of their approaching destruction it would be, to find, as assuredly they would, were not his advice com∣plied with; all such their delusive and ill grounded pre∣sumptions, and expectations, issue in fearful frustrations▪ and astonishing disappointments. This is the purport of that expression in our Text; <HI>And while ye <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ook for Light, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e turn it into the Shadow of death, and make it gross darkness.</HI></P>
<P>Our way is now cleared to a very weighty and awaken∣ing,</P>
<P><LABEL>DOCTRINE</LABEL>
<HI>It is the high concernment of all Orders of Men, among a Professing People, with whom God hath been long, to little purpose, pleading a Controversy, &amp; who on that account have rea∣son to expect more terrible out-breakings of divine Wrath upon them; to endeavour, in their several Capacities, A Speedy &amp; thorough</HI> REFORMATION <HI>of all GOD</HI>-Provoking Evils <HI>in the midst of them.</HI></P>
<P>This People to whom our Prophet mins<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tred, were a
<PB N="8" REF="001429_0010_0FB2F493EF2751D0"/>
People upon whom the Signs &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>okens of Gods wrath were very discernable, God had been for a long time pleading a Controversy with them: He had melted and tryed them in many a Furnace, and yet their dross was not purged away; The Judgments God had spent upon them were to little purpose: They continued a Stubborn Rebellious and Disobedient People. The Prophet assures them their abiding unreformed under the reiterated Strokes of divine displeasure, by which God had been Essaying their Amend∣ment and Recovery, out of their Sinful State and Conditi∣on, was displeasing to God, and would be of the last disad∣vantage to themselves: for this God would make Jerusa∣lem heaps, A den of dragons, their Cities should become desolate, and without Inhabitant; for this God would feed them with Wormwood, and give them the water of Gall to drink, <HI>Jer.</HI> 9 11, 15. He would dash them one a∣gainst another, Even the Fathers, and the Sons together, he would not pity, nor spare, nor have Mercy, but destroy them, <HI>Chap. 13, 14. v.</HI> And yet he improves these severe threatenings, and denunciations as a Stock suitable, and proper enough to graff this Serious and Awakening Ex∣hortation unto Speedy Repentance▪ and Reformation upon, as being the only way and means left to them, by which they might prevent the more terrible out-breakings of divine Vengeance, with the which they were menaced.</P>
<P>But I come to a more distinct Consideration of the Doctrine, in Four Propositions.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>I. PROPOSITION.</HEAD>
<P>GOD Sometimes hath, and for a long time pleads a Controversy with a <HI>Professing People.</HI> Three Conclusions will give us what may be needful to be spoken on this head.</P>
<P><HI>I.</HI> Concl. <HI>GOD Sometimes hath a Controversie with a Pro∣fessing People.</HI></P>
<P>It is a Singular favour of God unto any People, to bring them near, and take them into a Visible Covenant Relation
<PB N="9" REF="001429_0011_0FB2F498CDF89D48"/>
with himself. A favour, which a People are as far from meriting and deserving▪ as they are of improving and ob∣serving with due thankfulness, and proper returns of gra∣titude. It is by his Covenant that God makes over him∣self to a People, and undertakes to be their God, and the God of their Children after them. 'Tis this makes an Eter∣nal God to become their Refuge▪ and puts everlasting arms underneath them. Hither is owing, and to be referred the Lords revealing, making known, and preserving to a People the gracious and glorious discoveries of his will, relating to the way wherein they may expect all outward, spiritual and eternal blessings▪ according to the terms and conditions of the Everlasting Covenant, ratified and confir∣med in Christ, the Great and Alsufficient Mediator of it. It is because God is a God in Covenant with a People, that he vouchsa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es to them the injoyment of his Word, Wor∣ship, Ordinances and Institutions; the whole of the means of Gracè, the which God, by his Spirit, is pleased to bless unto the Conviction, Conversion, &amp; Regeneration of Souls▪ in order to their fellowship with Him, and Enjoyment of him, both in a State of Grace, and Glory. Well therefore might the holy <HI>Moses</HI> break forth into that rapturous Ex∣clamation, Deut. 33. 29. <HI>Happy art thou O Israel: who is like unto thee, O People Saved by the Lord, the shield of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> help, and who is the Sword of thy Excellency!</HI> But as the Priviledges of a People, who are in Covenant with God, are confessedly, and inexpressibly great, so also are their Duties and Obliga∣tions. Such a People are under Sacred and inviolable En∣gagements to Love, Fear, Serve, Worship, Believe in, rely &amp; de∣pend on, &amp; walk before God in all the ways of the Covenant. Thus we find God stating the Case betwixt himself, and his Covenant People Israel: Deut. 10. 12, 13 <HI>And now, Israel, what d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to Love him, and to Serve the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul; to keep the Commandments of the Lord, and his Statutes, which I command thee this Day for thy Good.</HI> A Covenant People are not left at their Liberty, whether they will Love, Fear, Serve
<PB N="10" REF="001429_0012_0FB2F49C9AFBAF30"/>
and Obey the Voice of God in his Commands, or not. They are under the highest, and most awful Obligations imaginable to the whole of Covenant duty; not only from Gods express Command and Precept, who is their King, Lord, and Lawgiver; but also, by virtue of their own Professed Subjection unto God, which is absolutely ne∣cessary in order to their maintaining a well grounded hope, and expectation of receiving from God the benefits, and blessings of the Covenant. The whole of this is well expressed by <HI>Moses</HI> in that Pathetical Address to Israel, Deut. 26. 16, 17, 18, 19. <HI>This day the Lord thy God hath Com∣manded Thee to do these Statutes, and Judgments: Thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thine heart, &amp; with all thy Soul. Thou hast avouched the Lord this day to be thy God; and to walk in his ways, and to keep his Statutes, and Command∣ments, and his Judgments, and to hearken unto his Voice. And ▪the Lord hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar People, as he hath promised thee, and that thou shouldest keep all his Commandments: And to make thee high above all Nations which he hath made, in Praise, and in Name, and in Honour, and that thou mayst be an holy People unto the Lord thy God as he hath spoken.</HI> They are therefore most Solemnly cau∣tioned to take heed to themselves, and beware, left they should forget and forsake the Lord, his Worship, Fear and Service; because by this means they would assuredly forfeit all those desirable blessings, which a course of Obe∣dience would crown them with, and pull down upon themselves the just rebukes, and terrible revenges of Heaven <HI>Deut 28. 15, ad <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inem.</HI> Both of these the holy <HI>Moses,</HI> excellently represents to Israel, as a means to en∣gage unto a diligent discharge of Covenant duties. Deut. 30. 15, 16, 17, 18. <HI>See, I have set before thee this day, life and good, and death and evil: In that I Command thee this day, to Love the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his Commandments, his Statutes, and his Judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply; and the Lord thy God shall bless thee in the Land whither thou go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st to possess it. But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hear, but shalt

Doth God then take a People into Covenant with him∣self? Are such a People under Obligations to Serve him? Is he graciously pleas'd to allow them all just and due encouragement to allure and bind them to his Service? Has he been wanting to caution, and antidote them against a forgetfulness of him, and the duties they owe him? Has he plainly assured them what fearful Calami∣ties a course of disobedience will bring upon them? Surely then if they rebelliously renounce the fealty &amp; ho∣mage they owe to God, wickedly withdraw themselves from his Reasonable Service, abandon themselves to those base and vile Practices, which are the abominable things his Soul hates, he has just reason to resent the wrong and injury done Him, to controvert with and testify against them that their sinful ways are highly displeasing to him; and altogether unanswerable to the Obligations he has laid upon them But this is sometime the state of the case betwixt God and his Covenant People. It was so with respect to that People of whom we read, Judg. 2. 11, 12. <HI>And the Children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and served B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alim: And they forsook the Lord God of their Fathers, which brought them out of the Land of Egypt, and followed other gods of the People that were round about them, and bowed themselves to them, and provoked the Lord to anger.</HI> This was the ground of the Lords Contro∣versy with them, a Controversy pleaded to the astonish∣ment of themselves, and the Nations round about them.

That his eyes behold, and his eye▪lids try the Children of Men, <HI>Psal.</HI> 11. 4. This is the purport of that Address of the Prophet <HI>Azariah</HI> to King <HI>Asa:</HI> a Chron. 15. 2. <HI>The Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s with you while ye are with him, and if ye seek him, he will be found of you, but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.</HI> When Sin abounds among a Professing People, they may not think that God will wink at it; or suffer them to persist therein without a sufficient discovery of the displeasure he concieves at it; he will let them know he resents the injury, and will plead with them for it, and lay open his controversy before them in all the parts and pleas of it. Thus the Prophet assured that Peo∣ple: Isai 3▪ 13, 14. <HI>The Lord standeth up to plead, and stand∣eth to judge the People: He will enter into judgment with the ancients of his People.</HI> 'Tis a Metaphor taken from Per∣sons that rise up, and stand before a Judge, while they are pleading their controversy, endeavouring to make the best of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>use. The Lord declares he is not in the least unwilling to have an <HI>Hearing,</HI> and refuseth not to stand a <HI>Tryal,</HI> no, he is earnestly desirous of it, and makes them the Offer: Isa 43. 26. <HI>Put me in remembrance, Let us</HI> plead <HI>together, declare thou that thou mayest be justifyed.</HI> God then will plead his Controversy with his People, and there are two ways, especially, by which he pleads it.</P>
<P>I. <HI>By His Word.</HI> Not by an audible voice from Hea∣ven, but by his word in the Mouths of his holy Ambas∣sadors whom for this End, as well as others▪ he dele∣gates, and sends to them. Upon this Errand the Prophets of old were sent, 'Twas their business and duty to carry the Lords Messages to his People, to acquaint them that the Lord knew, and was angry with them for their Sins. God gives them the State of the case betwixt Himself and his People, Commissions and Commands them to tell them of it, and to let them know who it was

Therefore now amend your ways, and your doings, and obey the Voice of the Lord your God, and the Lord will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you.</HI> 'Tis true, God hath long since desisted the calling forth, and improvement of persons in such an extraordinary way and manner; but the methods used by them in pleading the Lords controversy with a professing People, are transferred by him into the circumstances of the Gospel Ministry, whose work it is as wise Stewards of the Mysteries of God, to give unto all their portion in Season; to observe the way, frame, temper and conversations of all that are un∣der their care and inspection, and to hand forth to them, the counsels and advices which their condition, and neces∣sities require.

And indeed what other way hath God left, or what otherwise can he do for his People? Jer. 9 7. <HI>Therefore thus saith the Lord of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, I will melt them and try them, for how shall I do for the daughter of my People?</HI></P>
<P><HI>III.</HI> Concl. <HI>GOD insists upon his Controversy with his People, and continues to plead it for a long time.</HI> When God enters the lists with his declining People, he continues to dis∣ceptate with them, until he bring the quarrel of his Co∣venant to an issue. This God doth not, has not been wont to do speedily; He has ever taken a Considerable time to do it in. The Posterity of <HI>Seth</HI> before the Flood, in which the Line of the Church continued, were grown Extraordinarily Sinful and Degenerate: Thus we read, Gen. 6. 5. <HI>And God saw the Iniquity of Man was great in the Earth;</HI> Yet the Controversy God pleaded with them lasted no less than One hundred and Twenty years, <HI>v.</HI> 3. How long did God plead with his <HI>Israel,</HI> by a continued Series of Mercies and Judgments, before he brought the Quar∣rel of the Covenant to an issue, and put an End to it by the <HI>Babylonish</HI> Captivity? And doth not this course excel∣lently serve to illustrate the Covenant, Grace and Mercy of God to his People? He delights in Mercy, and is the inexhaustible fountain of Grace and Goodness: His Grace and Mercy are Essential Properties of his Nature, and no small part of the Letters of his Name. The long-suffer∣ing and patience God expresseth towards his People, whilst he is pleading his Controversy with them, do abundant∣ly demonstrate him to be Merciful and full of Compassion. It is indeed a part of his Covenant to visit their trans∣gressions with a rod, and their iniquity with stripes: But yet when he proceeds to this necessary piece of dis∣cipline, he delights to represent himself under the most agreeable Character of a Tender hearted Parent, who though he sometimes is forced to hearden his heart, and stop his ears against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Crys of his rebellious Children, knowing there is a folly in them, which must be driven out by

the rod of Correction; yet at another time, throws the assumed rod out of his hands, being overcome by the er∣resistible force of his bowel Compassions. Thus the case is represented, <HI>Hos. 11. 8, 9. &amp; Psal.</HI> 78. 38, 39. It is his long-suffering Grace and Mercy that puts him to wait upon his People, and to see how they will behave them∣selves under, and what impressions and dispositions the rod will work upon them. Thus we r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad, <HI>Jer.</HI> 8. 6. <HI>I hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright, no man repented of his wickedness, saying, What have I done?</HI> Besides, the longer God waits upon and is pleading the quarrel of his Covenant with his People, tho more, if they continue im∣peditent and unreformed, will they ripen themselves for the ruin which the putting a final issue to it will bring upon them. God waits on those who are not in Covenant with him, until they are ripe for ruin. Gen, 15. 16. <HI>The Iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.</HI> Much more will he do thus by those whom he hath taken near to himself. And to shut up this Conclusion, will not this course ren∣der a People more abundantly ine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cusable, when a period shall be put to the date of divine Patience, and Forbear∣ance; and Judgment to the uttermost is brought upon them, upon whom God has been so long waiting, and with whom he has been using in the Course of his holy Providence all proper means to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eclaim, and reduce them to a sense of their duty, without gaining the Expected point upon them? <HI>Jer. 25. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, v.</HI></P>

This is the Language of that queru∣lous Expostulation, <HI>Isa.</HI> 1. 2, 3, 4, 5. 'Tis possible, whilst the Correcting Rod lyes heavy on them, we may find them pretending to humble themselves, to turn to him that smites them, asking forgiveness, and promising A∣mentment: but no sooner <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the bitter smart relax't, and the Judgment remov'd, but they are just the men they were before, and make it appear that they flattered God with their Mouths, and lyed to him with their Tongues, <HI>Psal.</HI> 78 35, 36, 37.

<P><HI>It is the high concernment of all Orders amongst a People, with wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> the case thus stands, in their several Stations and Capa∣cities, to indeavour the Speedy</HI> Reformation <HI>of the God pro∣voking Evils in the midst of them.</HI> I shall briefly propose a few things for the illustration of the Proposition.</P>
<P N="1">1. Nothing less than such a <HI>Reformation</HI> will suffice to put an End to Gods Controversy with such a People, and Secure them from justly expected and deserved Judg∣ments. It is true, God hath given encouragement to a reforming People, to hope and believe for his return to them in a way of Mercy and Favour, and that he will repent him of the Evils he hath threatned to bring upon them. Jer. 18. 7, 8. <HI>At what instant I shall speak concerning a Nation, and concerning a Kingdom to pull down, and destroy it; if that Nation against whom I have pronounced turn from their Evils, I will repent of the Evil I thought to do unto them.</HI> This duty God recommends unto, and urgeth upon a degenerate People, threat'ned with the Effects of his sorest displeasure, Jer. 7. 3. <HI>Thus saith the Lord of Hosts the God of Israel, Amend your ways, and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.</HI> For such a People God hath appeared in a way of Covenant Compassion, recovering them out of those depths of Misery and distress into which, by their Sins, they have plunged themselves. Judg. 10. 16. <HI>And they put away the strange gods from among them, and Served the
<PB N="21" REF="001429_0023_0FB2F4BEE735B458"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> was grieved for the miseries of Israel.</HI> But without such a Reformation a Professing People have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o reason <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o look for, or expect the returns of Gods favour; he hath threatened them, and will be as good as his word, That if they walk contrary unto him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he will walk con∣trary unto them, and continue them under the smarting Rod of divine Corrections, <HI>Levit,</HI> 26. 21.</P>
<P N="2">2. When the Wrath of God hath been poured out upon a People, and the more terrible Out-breakings of it threat∣ned, and justly Expected, they can never be too speedy in their applications unto the only means of safety and security. In no case can delays be supposed to breed, and bode greater hazzard and danger. For if the Reformation of every thing that is provoking to God amongst such a People be not speedily pursued, whence can the neglect be supposed to flow, but from a perverse resolvedness to persist in their Sinful Courses, and a wretched insensi∣bility of, and stupid unconcernedness about the miseries consequential hereupon? And surely this cannot be ima∣gined an Omen for good to them! The Language of such a negligent People (for Actions Speak as well as Words) is nothing less than a bold and daring challenge unto the Almighty to do his worst; and informs the World, they are equally regardless of his frowns and favours. What can the meaning of such an inadvertent conduct be but this, <HI>Let Him make speed, and hasten his work that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e may see it Isai.</HI> 5. 19? Will not God then take up such a Resolution as this, <HI>As the fire devoureth the Stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff, so their Root shall be rottenness, and their blossoms go up as the dust,</HI> Isai. 5. 24.</P>
<P N="3">3. All Orders of Men amongst such a People, should indeavour, in their several Stations, and Capacities to pro∣mote this Reformation. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. When God is pleading a Controversy with a degene∣rate People, all orders▪ among them have reason enough to conclude, they have Some way or other contributed to∣wards it, and should there▪upon take themselves concerned to indeavour and put forward the Reformation, whereby
<PB N="22" REF="001429_0024_0FB2F4C0311E3418"/>
the divine Anger may be appeased. It is possible that those who lead a People may cause them to err, and de∣stroy the way of their paths, <HI>Isai.</HI> 3. 12. A culpable in-advertency in them, a careless slackenning the reins of Government, may give a silent, and powerful growth to those impieties which will cause the anger of the Lord to smoke against a People. Their Secular Interest may possibly dispose them to wink and connive at, or to be less active than is meet, for Persons in their circumstances, in their appearances against and withstanding those corrupt practices, which ripen a People for ruin and destruction. A burning Zeal in them, for the Glory of God may be under too great damps and abatements. A Spirit of fear, timorousness, and cowardize may, possibly, surprize and indispose them to a vigourous and steady Execution of those Laws, by which bold transgressors ought to be severe∣ly reflected on, that Others might hear, and fear, and be discouraged from doing so wickedly. Whatever of this nature the Rulers of a People may have to charge upon themselves, the consideration thereof should doubtless be improved to invigorate their indeavour to pursue a Re∣formation. Amongst the body of a degenerate People incentives to engage them in the work of Reformation, can never be wanting, if the share they have had in the Sins and Transgressions, which call for and demand it, be duely weighed and considered. They will indubitably, upon their inquiry, find reason sufficient to look upon themselves, as God accounts of them, <HI>A Sinful Nation, a People laden with Iniquities.</HI> Cause they have to charge upon themselves, bold transgressions against, and frequent violations of the wholesome Laws by which their Conver∣sations should be squared and ordered. Is it not the Custom of such a People to neglect and despise the Orders and Calls of their Godly Rulers, to Repent of and Reform their Immoralities? Are they not Arraigned for pulling a∣way the Shoulder, stopping their Ears, and making their hearts harder than the Adamant and the nether Milestone, that they might not hear the Voice of God speaking to

them, by the Ministers of his Word, who are labouring their Amendment and Reformation? Surely then it is their concernment to indeavour the Reformation by which the heats of Gods anger may be allayed, and the returns of his Favour and Mercy Secur'd?</P>
<P N="2">2. It cannot be reasonably expected, that a <HI>Reformation</HI> will be produced unless all Orders among a People engage in it▪ Godly Rulers should look upon it their Place to lead the way, and go before the People in the Work of Reformation; they should arise therefore, and be of good Courage, for the matter belongeth unto them, <HI>Ez<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> 9. 4. The Ruled amongst a People should account it their duty, to follow the Encouraging Examples of their Godly Ru∣lers.

<P N="3">3.

<P N="1">1. The Doctrine discovers to us the reason why God is sometimes pleased, to alter the course of his Providence to∣ward a Professing People. If they be not continued under

<P N="2">2. The Doctrine exposeth the Sin and Folly of a Profes∣sing People in <HI>Forsaking God,</HI> his Fear, Worship, and Service, and in giving themselves up to a way and course of Disobe∣dience to his holy and righteous commands. A Professing People are under the most Sacred and indispensible Obliga∣tions to Love, Fear, Serve and Worship God, and Obey the voice of all his Commandments, and have the highest and greatest Encouragements imaginable, to dispose them to a discharge of Covenant duty. They may promise them∣selves the injoyment of Gods presence and blessing, while they walk with him in the Commanded Path of Duty and Obedience. But if they renounce the fealty and homage they owe him, will not this open a fearful Gap for Miseries and Evils of all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orts to break in upon, &amp; overwhelm them? And are they able to stand &amp; stout it out against him? can they ward off the blows of his furious hand, when he shall stretch it out to lay hold on Judgment, &amp; resist the impressi∣ons of his anger &amp; displeasure? Surely then it is their Sin and Folly to provoke &amp; displease him, since they cannot but be assured, that in so doing their own wickedness will correct them, and their backslidings reprove them; and that God will sooner or later, make them to know and see what an Evil thing and bitter it is, that they have forsaken him; and that his fear hath not been in them, <HI>Jer. 2. 19</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The Doctrine gives us abundant reason to conclude it a matter of sad thought, and awful consideration, when
<PB N="25" REF="001429_0027_0FB2F4C7E81ACCC8"/>
the Lord removes, by Death, many out of every Order a∣mongst a degenerate People, who were men well-quali∣fied and spirited to promote a work of Reformation. This is spoken of as a solemn token of Gods anger and displea∣sure against a People, <HI>Isa.</HI> 3. 1. These are the Chariots of Israel, and the Horsemen thereof: and the removal of such is a terrible Prognostick of fearful Calamities ready to break in upon a People. When God intends to bring aw∣ful Judgments upon a People, he is wont to remove such, whose earnest Prayers and Supplications would prevail to stay his hands, and interrupt the course of his Judicial proceedings with them. What cause then hath <HI>New-Eng∣land</HI> of deep humiliation, and lamentation, from whom God hath removed so many of every Order, whose Abili∣ties, Holiness, Zeal and Faithfulness, together with their great interest in Heaven had rendered them very choice, useful and desirable blessings? Time would fail me should I Essay the Enumeration of all those, who deserve to be taken notice of under such a Character. But yet it might be deservedly accounted piacular, not to make a particular mention of those, Excellent and Eminent Persons, the Re∣verend Mr. <HI>Samuel Torrey,</HI> and the Reverend Mr. <HI>Samuel Wil∣lard,</HI> whose great multifarious Services for God and this his People, as they ought never to be forgotten, so can they never be duely remembred, without a just Tribute of Thankfulness to God, who lent them so long unto us, and a becoming Sorrow of heart, that they were so soon and at so critical a juncture removed from us. The year past hath called from us an Honourable, Useful, and Aged Counsellour; and given us the occasion of lamenting the Funeral of that Eminently holy, and aged Servant of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Reverend Mr. <HI>John Higginson,</HI> by whom, many years since (from the Place where I now stand) the Cause of God and this his Wilderness People was so Judiciously stated and asserted. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>New-England</HI> how wide are thy <HI>Breaches</HI> grown?

<PB N="26" REF="001429_0028_0FB2F4C92A2F4548"/>
how little are such awful stroaks regretted, and laid to heart by us! And is not this the more Ominous and Por∣tenous, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith we have but too much reason to conclude, God hath taken away such Righteous ones from the Evil to come? <HI>Isai. 57. 1.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The Doctrine intimates to us that it is accounted a Singular Mercy of God, and an Omen for good, when there are many in all Orders amongst a degenerate People who are well qualified and spirited, to promote the Work of <HI>Re∣formation.</HI> This is a Sign that God is not designed sud∣denly to break up house, and make quick dispatch with them. Such will not only Mourn for, but resolvedly put to an helping hand toward the <HI>Reformation</HI> of what ever is amiss amongst them. Their Tears, Cares &amp; Prayers and Assistances will be ever imployed as a means to stay the Lords hand, and to remove, as much as possibly they can, the known Occasions of his anger and displeasure. When God designed to bring about the Reformation of Israel, he advanced <HI>David</HI> to the Throne. This was the Godly man whom God, in this respect, as well as others, set a part for himself, <HI>Psal 4 3.</HI> And you see the early Resoluti∣ons of that Excellent Person, <HI>Psal. 75. 2, 4. When I shall re∣cieve the Congregation, I will judge uprightly, I said to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ools deal not Foolishly, and to the Wicked lift not up the horn.</HI> It was his fixed resolve to Set no wicked thing before his Eyes, and to hate the work of them that turned aside: Wicked Persons had no reason to expect any favour or shelter from him, No, A froward heart, he was determin'd should depart from him: The faithful in the Land whose Spirits had been discouraged, damp't and cow'd out, whilst a vile Person had been Exalted amongst them, might now promise themselves and Expect all manner of Encouragement from him; for his Eyes, he resolv'd, should be upon the faithful in the Land, that they might dwell with him, and serve him. 'Twas by these he knew he should be assisted in the Execution of the Noble design he had in his heart, to destroy all the wicked out of the Land, and to cut them off from the City of the Lord, <HI>Psal. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>01.

per totum.</HI> Amongst the many things which offer a Melan∣cholly prospect to us, the consideration of this, that there are so many in Civil and Sacred Order, and of the body of this declining People who are Persons of an Excellent and Eminent Character, for practical Piety and Godliness, proposeth to us matter of singular Hope and Expectation. No doubt their care, and thoughts are continually imploy∣ed, in Studying and devising by what means, the true in∣terests of Religion may be subserved; this People reco∣vered out of their declining State, and the terrible out∣breakings of the Divine Wrath averted from us. What gratitudes and acknowledgments then, are there owing to God, on this account, who hath not permitted our condition to be such, That there should not be a man left amongst us to stand in the Gap; or who might hopefully labour to make up the breach?</P>
<P N="5">5. The Doctrine calls upon all Orders of Men, to indea∣vour in their several Stations and Capacities, a speedy Re∣formation of the God Provoking Evils amongst us.</P>
<P>And,</P>
<P><HI>First the Exhortation is Proposed to the Fathers of the Country, Political and Spiritual.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Our Political Fathers are called upon to do all that lie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in their power, that this People, under their Conduct, may become a Reformed People.</HI> Can encouragements be wanting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o in∣vigourate their utmost Application, unto an affair of such grand and necessary importance? Are they not the keep∣ers of both Tables? Are they not arm'd with a Suffici∣ency of Power and Authority, to demand and enforce the steady Observation of Holiness and Vertue? Should they not be a Terrour to Evil Works, and a Praise to those that do Well? Has not the Work of <HI>Reformation</HI> a great dependance, under God, who hath the hearts of all men in his hands, upon their Courage, Prudence, Zeal, and Activity? We never read, in Sacred, or Ecclesiastical Hystory, of any notable general Reformation amongst a People, except the Magistrate did Countenance, and help it forward? Would <HI>Judah</HI> have ever been Reformed if
<PB N="28" REF="001429_0030_0FB2F4CCE44CADC8"/>
those Excellent Princes. <HI>Asa, Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah,</HI> and <HI>Jo∣siah</HI> had not bestowed their indefatigable care, and pains in producing their Reformation? Most sure it is, that Reli∣gious and Reforming Magistrates have all the reason in the World to expect, that their steady Engagement in a Work so pleasing and grateful to Heaven, will secure to them the presence of a Gracious, and Almighty God, and Entail his lasting blessing on them.</P>
<P>Should not many things be Essayed by the Civil Autho∣rity, toward the putting a stop to the growth of those Im∣moralities, which will assuredly bring the terrible Reven∣ges of Heaven upon the People under their Conduct? Can they not do much this way by being Exemplary to them in all manner of holy and circumspect Conversation? Is it not to be hop'd that their Religious Examples will be attended with Potent Charms, and powerful Incentives? Will not the Godly in the Land readily fall in, and com∣ply with the Encouraging Precedent; and Iniquity for shame stop her Mouth?</P>
<P>Should not Laws be Enacted for the Suppressing of Vice and Impiety? And if Experience testifies the insufficiency of such as are already made to reach the End intended by them, must not Others be Contrived and Established which will offer a greater probability of Success? But will this answer the designs of Reformation, if when all is done they be not duely, strictly, and impartially Executed? To what End is the naked Sword in State born before the Ma∣gistrate, but to signify his readiness to be a revenger, and to Execute Wrath upon him that doth Evil? Should not the Persons into whose hands the Executive Part of the Law is betrusted, be Men of Prudence, Piety, Zeal &amp; Cou∣rage, and should not their attendance to their duty be Prudently look't into and observed? Will not the Im∣provement of Persons of a contrary Temper and Character be altogether disserviceable to the desired, and pleaded for Reformation? Ought not the Law to be vigorously Urged and Executed, in which Provision is made for the Supply of all Places, by a Learned Orthodox &amp; Faithful Ministry,
<PB N="29" REF="001429_0031_0FB2F4D0A8D3C458"/>
especially such as have from the very first of the Settlement lived in a way of defi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nce to Gospel Order? Is it not ne∣cessary that every good thing be carefully cherished, up∣held, and promoted, and the things strengthened that are ready to dye?</P>
<P><HI>May it, therefore Please your</HI> EXCELLENCY!</P>
<P>The Unerring Providence of GOD, and the favour of the best of QUEENS, have placed your Excellency at the Helm of Government over this Province: You will therefore SIR, Account it your Honour &amp; Duty to resemble the Deity in all acts of Piety &amp; goodness; and to copy after the illustri∣ous Example of Her most Excellent Majesty, whose repeated PROCLAMATIONS against Vice, &amp; Immoralities, have abundantly convinced the World, that Her Majesty is at an irreconcilable Enmity with every thing that has a tendency to draw down the Wrath of an Almighty, and Sin hating GOD, on the Kingdoms and Plantations over whom She Sways Her Imperial Scepter. GOD hath adorned your Ex∣cellency with admirable Accomplishments, and uncommon Talents: Your Excellency will give us leave to expect, that they shall all be improved for the Glory &amp; Honour of God, and the Reformation of a People labouring under the just rebukes &amp; displeasure of Heaven, on the score of their Mul∣tiplied Transgressions and Provocations.</P>
<P>Permit me SIR, to Observe, That your Excellencies very Honourable Father was One of those Noble Patriots, under whose Religious &amp; Auspicious Conduct were laid the Foun∣dations of our <HI>New-England</HI> Heavens &amp; Earth, I mean, their Sacred &amp; Civil Constitution, on which account, his Name is Worthy an Everlasting Remembrance. It went well with that Generation, in whose stead is risen up ano∣ther Generation, who have in a great measure forsaken God, and Sinned away much of his gracious Presence from them. How agreable a thing will it be that your Excellency by Powerful Example, and Proper Influence, on all who move under you in a lower Sphere, should Endeavour the bringing back this People to the Lord God of their Fathers? Thus doing God will be with own, bless and prosper you;
<PB N="30" REF="001429_0032_0FB2F4D31CC0AC08"/>
And your Excellencies Name will not only be hereby ren∣dered dear and honourable to the latest Posterity, but af∣ter, SIR, You have here Served your Generation by the will of God, a safe Retreat will be Secured for you into the Arms of Eternal Mercy.</P>
<P>AS for those <HI>Honourable persons</HI> that are, or may this day be Chosen to assist his Excellency in Council; It is the ear∣nest hope and expectation of those by whom you are Chosen into that Post of Honour and Trust, and of all the God-fear∣ing Souls in the Province, that you will carefully intend and promote the Speedy Reformation, of all that is pro∣voking to God in the Land. Your Honours are well ac∣quainted with the Way, Humour, Frame, Temper, Temp∣tations and Provocations of this People, and will not be thereby discouraged from attempting whatever is necessary to be done, for promoting a Work so desireable and neces∣sary. Whatever Oppositions, or Obstructions may lye in the way, the Presence of God will easily remove, or help you to Surmount them. Will your Honours then be pleased to Arise, and Buckle to the Work with a renewed Application. God we trust, will own and crown your En∣deavours with Success. However it prove, your Honours will have comfort and Satisfaction in this, That you have faithfully Endeavoured the discharge of the trust Commit∣ted to you by God and Man, and may be sure to obtain a Proportionable Reward.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Worthy Gentlemen of the House of Representatives,</HI> who have called me (the unworthiest of all the Servants of the Lord in the Ministry) to Speak on such, and so great an Occasion as this, will allow me the freedom of putting them in mind, that they have a great Opportunity, Privilege and Advantage in their hands, unto the doing of what is very considerable toward the promoting the necessary Reforma∣tion, I am pleading for▪ You have the Privilege of Assist∣ing, at least, in the choice of those Worthy Persons, who are to be chosen to assist his Excellency in Council, and to help manage the Affairs of the Publick in this Stormy and diffi∣cultly circumstanced Season; what care and conscience

ought you take that your Suffrages be given for those, who in the best of your Judgment are duely qualified for so great a trust, and will be most likely to address themselves, with an indefatigableness of Application, to the Opposing &amp; Dis∣countenancing whatever is a ground of Gods Controversy with his People, by whom you are betrusted. You will doubtless look upon it your duty and concern, to consent unto the Laws which are yet necessary to be Made and E∣nacted, for the Promoving and Securing the Religious; or Temporal Interests of the Country. Your Prudence, Piety, Zeal for the Glory of God, and your Country's good, are greatly relied on, and you will not fail to give signal proofs and demonstrations of them. You forget not that the Country's Purse is in your hands; you will be careful to Husband it to the best Advantage, considering it's very low and reduced Circumstances; but yet will in no sort be wanting to supply the Treasury, with what is necessary for the safety and defence of the Country, and the honou∣rable Support of the Government.</P>
<P N="2">2. Here is a call to our Spiritual Fathers in the Churches▪ They will permit One of the Meanest and Unworthiest of their Order to put them in mind, how greatly they are concerned to do all they can to promove a Work of <HI>Refor∣mation</HI> amonst this People.</P>
<P><HI>Reverend and Highly Esteemed:</HI> The Lord Jesus Christ, the great Shepherd and Bishop of Souls, hath called us forth and set us apart to bear His Name before this Generation of his People. We are under most Sacred, Solemn &amp; Awful Obligations unto a constant, careful, and conscionable im∣provement of all the Talents &amp; Abilities, the glorious head of Influences hath furnished us with, in order unto our Subserving their best and eternal interests. Our Endea∣vours must not, and I trust, thro Grace assisting, will not be wanting to lay before them, plain, clear, full and awa∣kening discoveries of the whole will of God concerning them. Altho' we ought to acknowledge, with great Humi∣lity, and Thankfulness the Lords Singular Mercy &amp; Favour to us, in rendering us Instrumental unto the Saving good
<PB N="32" REF="001429_0034_0FB2F4D6C3864860"/>
of Many, thro' the Almighty Efficacy &amp; Influence, of his holy Spirit, that he hath vouchsaf't to us so many Seals of our Ministry, who truly fear, serve, and endeavour to glo∣rify God by an holy, useful, and Exemplary Conversation; Yet the dull, dead, careless, worldly, sensual &amp; inexemplary Conversations of many who make a Profession of Godliness, the manifest Tokens of an Impenitent, irregenerate Spirit upon many of the Standing and Uprising Generation; not∣withstanding all Care and Pains taken with them, to dispose them to a sense of their Eternal Concernments, afford us matter of very trembling, and humbling consideration, and ought to awaken us unto a Studious Thoughtfulness upon the properest Methods may be used with them, by a blessing on which they may be rendered the glorious Instances of Sparing and Saving Mercy. Great care must be taken that we do not give way to discouragement: With a Sincere reliance on the Victorious Grace of God, which alone is Sufficient to change and convert, the otherwise unconque∣rable, hearts of Sinners. Let us resolve to persist in an En∣deavour of making full proof of our Ministry, Preaching the Word in Season and out of Season, reproving, rebuking, exhorting with all long-suffering and doctrine: Mainly insisting on those Truths, which tend to lay open the Na∣ture and Necessity of Conversion, and the danger of conti∣nuing in a Christless, and Impenitent State and Condition. A due level must be taken at the Prevailing Sins &amp; Vices of the Times, and the present duty of them urged with a repeatedness of inculcation. Alluring addresses are to be made unto Sinners, to invite them, unto a forsaking the foolish, that so they may live; and a glorious Saviour Set before and offered to them, as the only way of obtaining Pardon, and blessedness. We must never forget to be car∣rying our Flocks in the Arms of our Faith and Prayers to the Merciful Throne; nor forbear to be wrestling with the God and Father of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e would pour out his Spirit upon them, and attend the dispensations of the Word of his Grace, with a divine blessing, and an irresistible Influence. An holy Discipline
<PB N="33" REF="001429_0035_0FB2F4DC37577718"/>
must be constantly used, and improv'd upon the proper Oc∣casions that call for it. Our more private Personal In∣structions, Exhortations, Cautions, Counsels. Warnings and Admonitions, as Opportunity may be offered; would on a tryal be found some of the best Expedients, by which the designs of practical Godliness would be wonderfully Sub∣served. The Lambs of the Flock must be tenderly regard∣ed; it is necessary we make them the Subjects of our cares, and repeated Instructions; it is criminal to exclude them from the watch and discipline, their being a part of the Flo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>akes owing to them.

How altogether necessary should we sup∣pose it to be, that our Families be preserved under the exactest Order and Regulations, and a due distance kept by all under the wing of our domestical Government, from every thing which in others bespeak our just Reproofs and Reprehensions? Would not a strict and cordial Union a∣mongst our Selves, the more Orderly practice of the Con∣sociation of Churches, and Upholding and Preserving the just Authority of Councils, without the least infringement of the Liberties and Privileges by divine appointment be∣longing to particular Churches; and the making due Pro∣vision for the tryall of the Abilities and Conversation of Such as are to be improved for Gospel Service, in the Churches of the faithfull, tend much to the Stengthening our hands, and be of Singular advantage to us in the Pur∣suing of those things whereby the best Good of this Peo∣ple may be hopefully Subserved?</P>
<P><HI>Secondly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Here is a Call to the whole Body of this People;</HI> To endeavour a speedy <HI>Reformation,</HI> of all the God Provoking Evils amongst them.</P>

pleading with them: they are too apt to take up and con∣cieve a better Opinion of themselves than they deserve: and thus it was with that People, tho' a very Sinful and Wicked People. Jer. 2. 35. <HI>Yet thou sayest because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn from me.</HI> And hence it came to pass, when the Prophet denounced against them terrible threatenings by the Command of God, they boldly de∣mand, <HI>Wherefore hath the Lord pronounced all this great Evil against us, Or what is our iniquity? Or what is our Sin that we have committed against the Lord our God?</HI> Jer. 16. 10. Un∣til a People are convinced of the causes of Gods anger and displeasure against them, there is no Expectation or hope of their Humiliation and Reformation. That God hath been pleading and still continues to plead a Controversy with <HI>New-England,</HI> is too plain and evident to be denied. It is, indeed generally own'd and confessed, and were it not, yet the awfull and terrible Judgements by which God hath been contending with us, are incontestible de∣monstrations of it. How greatly then are we concerned to be Seriously inquisitive into the grounds and causes of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Elders</HI> and <HI>Messengers</HI> of these Churches, assembled in this Town, in a Synod, almost thirty years since, have Solemnly declared to the World, what the Sins were which they concluded to be the Causes of Gods heavy Judgments on the Land. The Publick have an account of it in their hands. A great part of that Assembly of good, holy Men, are gathered to their Fathers, but their Testi∣mony Survives, and will be a lasting and speaking Wit∣ness for God against us. For do not these Sins yet remain Unreformed? Do they not still continue the Causes of Gods anger against us? Is there not yet cause to Com∣plain, that there is a great and visible decay of the Life and Power of Religion amongst us? Are not many guilty of Heart Apostasy from God? Has not the Glorious Gos∣pel of the Son of God been dispised; A precious Saviour, and the Offers of Eternal Salvation in and thro' Him re∣jected, by Multitudes amongst us? Do not many make it
<PB N="35" REF="001429_0037_0FB2F4E2B9F20BA0"/>
Evident that they are under the Power &amp; Working of a Spirit of Unbelief and Irregeneracy? Are not Church fellow∣ship and other divine Institutions, for the sake of which our Fathers in a special manner followed the Lord into this Wilderness, greatly Rejected? Do not many Places live without the Setled Enjoyment of the Means of Grace? Are not Execrable Oaths, and vain Swearing, by which the glorious Name of God is fearfully Profaned, become a matter of too common Practice? Is not the Rest of Gods holy Sabbath, by Multitudes horribly Profaned and Polluted? Do not ill governed Ignorant Profane, and Prayerless Families abound in the Land? Are not this People too generally guilty of irreverend, and irrespectful behaviour towards those whom God hath Set over them in Church and State? Are not <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> the Sub∣jects still of their Complaints and Murmurings? What a Prodigious discovery will an ordinary Observation make to us of the Inordinate Passions, Sinful Hearts, Hatreds, Evil Surmisings, Uncharitable Censures, Opprobrious Re∣flections, Reviling Expressions, Backbitings and Slanders, whereby the holy Religion we make a Profession of, is fearfully defiled; and the anger of the Lord most terribly excited? Doth not the Pride of <HI>New-England</HI> testify to her face; and is there not too general an affectation of such a slanting Garb, Mode and Dress, as is highly Unbecoming a People under such sensible &amp; continued rebukes of Hea∣ven? Doth not the Shameful and worse than Bruitish Sin of Drunkenness, like an irresistible Inundation threaten to carry all before it? And may not the formidable growth of this Impiety, be supposed in no small degree owing to the just revenges of Heaven upon us, for debauching the <HI>Indian Natives</HI> of the Land, in defiance to that truely No∣ble and Glorious Undertaking on foot, to bring home these lost and bewildred Creatures, to the great Shepherd and Bishop of Souls? Are not hainous, and fearful breaches of the Seventh Commandment, and temptations thereunto become exceeding frequent, in the Land, notwithstanding the Care is taken to prevent them? Doth not a Worldly

Spirit prevail upon us? And are not the—of a Pub∣lick Spirit, Truth and Faithfulness, and the Oppressions, Ex∣tortion, Fraud, Cheats and Cousenages so much and so fre∣quently complained of, the undeniable indications of it? Do we not live in the neglect of a due and right improve∣ment, of the Liberties and Priviledges we are permitted to enjoy, which might greatly subserve the interests and de∣signs of Religion amongst us? How careless are Multi∣tudes, in managing the Choice of those that are to Represent them in the Great and General Assembly? how many neg∣lect to improve the Liberty allow'd em, and how many abuse it as unto the Serving of a Party, or as a tool and instrument to gratify their Corruptions? Is it not a thing would greatly conduce to the Service of Religion, and the Promoting its Interests, if such were chosen for <HI>Grand-jurors</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>thingmen,</HI> as are Men of Piety, Zeal so God, and make Conscience of and fear an Oath; but how careless are many Places as to this, nay are there not sometimes such Chosen as discover an Intreague to defeat the good intentions they are designed to pursue? How little care is there generally taken, especially in Country Towns, to promote the Liberal Education of Children? How much is it become the Practice of many Towns, so Study Tricks and Shifts whereby the Laws of the Land obliging to the upholding and maintaining of Schools, may be wholly evaded and lose its Efficacy? And is not this Provoking to God▪ and disserviceable to the interest of Poste∣rity? Have not all the Judgments whereby God hath been for so long a time contending with us, been ineffectu∣al to reclaim us? And what but a Perverse and Impeni∣tent Spirit, hating to be Reformed, and refusing to Return can be supposed the Ground and Reason of it? And do not these things give us reason to conclude, that the un∣comfortable Shadows of a dark Evening are ready to spread their Sable Wings over us? Behold! Behold, O <HI>New-Eng∣land,</HI> the Cause thy God hath to be angry with Thee! And wilt thou not wash thine heart from Uncleanness that thou mayst be Saved?</P>

2. <HI>Seriously Ponder the Progress God hath made in Pleading his Controversy with us.</HI> Have we not been under a long con∣tinued Series of Judicial Dispensations? Hath not the Rain of our Land been frequently turn'd to Powder and Dust? Have not our Husbandmen been call'd to howl? Have not devouring Insects, consuming Droughts, and pinching Frosts repeated the Tokens of Gods anger upon us? How often have Pestilential Diseases received a Com∣mission to March thro' the Land? And have not Multi∣tudes hereby encreased the number of our Dead amongst us? Have not ruining and impoverishing losses by Sea been multiplied upon us? Hath not the Lord drawn out the Sword of the Covenant against us? Has it not for al∣most four and thirty years, with little Intermission de∣voured much Flesh, and increased the number of the Lords slain in the Land? Are not many of our Sons &amp; Daugh∣ters in Captivity? How many Towns lye wast and deso∣late without Inhabitant, and this by the Lords moving us to Jealousy with those who are not a People, and provo∣king us to anger with a foolish Nation? Are not our Frontiers, notwithstanding all means to relieve and sup∣port them, in a wasting, consuming and miserable Condi∣tion? Has not the Stink of our Camps been sent into our Nostrils, and our hopefulest Expeditions frowned upon and disappointed, so that our Enemies laugh amongst them∣selves, and those that hate us clap their hands? Have not <HI>Spiritual Flagues</HI> been poured on us? Is not the Word to many become Penal, Blinding and Judicial? Is not the Spirit of Grace, as to its Converting and Regenerating In∣fluences under powerful Restraints? Do not the terrible and amazing tokens of a Perverse, Refractory, Unyielding, Insensible Spirit appear upon us, notwithstanding all the terrible dispensations of Gods Wrath against us? And are not all these things a sure and undeniable Evidence, that God hath made a Considerable Progress in pleading his Con∣troversy with us? And what can the United Voice of all these Judgments be, But this, <HI>Be instructed</HI> O New-England <HI>lest my Soul depart from Thee?</HI> But what shall be attempted

to put a stop to the terrible Out-breakings of Gods Ang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and Displeasure, which these things are the assured so runners of? A REFORMATION! A REFORMATION And what must be done that it may be produced?</P>
<P><HI>I must but briefly touch on the things that claim a Consideration by us.</HI></P>
<P>Should you not then, O ye Covenant People of the Lord, with deepest Penitential Mourning and Humiliation, fall down before a justly irritated and offended God, and with ut-most brokenness of heart own, &amp; acknowledge all your mighty Sins and multiplied transgressions, and all their highly aggravated Circumstances, as being Commit∣ted against so much Light, Love, Merciful dispensations, Repeated Convictions, Warnings, Cautions, Confessions, Vows and Promises of Amendment? Should you not humbly accept the Punishment of your Sins, and Confess that God is Righteous in all his dispensations of humbling Providences, by which he hath testified his anger and dis∣pleasure against you? And that in the midst of his Judg∣ments, He hath remembred Mercy, Punishing you less than you have deserved? Is it not duty to repent of, hate, abhor, turn from, forsake, and loath your selves for all the high handed Provocations, whereby you have in∣censed the Divine Majesty against you, and so far caused Him to become, and act toward you as an Enemy? Is not the Pardoning Grace and Mercy of God thro' the Al∣mighty Redeemer, to be humbly and earnestly implored, and sincerely relied on? Should you not Endeavour a full purpose of heart, to renounce all the ways of Sin and Folly, and walk uprightly with God in all the duties of the Covenant? And can any of these duties be performed by you, unless the Lord by the irresistible Grace of his Spirit turn, change and make a victorious Conquest upon your hearts, taking away the heart of Stone, and giving you an heart of Flesh? Is it not then your high con∣cernment, by earnest Prayers and Supplications, to implore this Mercy from the Hands of a God hearing Prayer, that

Should not all that are truly Godly Stir up themselves to lay hold on God, and humble themselves under a Soul awakening sense of their deadness, dulness, carnal Mindedness; want of due Watch∣fulness over themselves, their hearts and wayes? That they have Maintained no more of Fellowship and Com∣munion with God, been no more Circumspect and Ex∣emplary in their Lives and Conversations, Shown no more Zeal for God, and given so little Obstruction to the growth of Sin and Profaness?

Are any possible En∣couragements wanting? Is not the Lord yet treatable? As yet he owns a Covenant Relation to us; and has a considerable Interest amongst us. The Decree has not yet brought forth.
