<HEAD>NARRATIVE.</HEAD>
<P>AS the late scene in Bennington, which has closed with my dismission, is not only in∣teresting to my friends, who are fellow-sufferers with me, but it is imagined that the knowledge of it may be useful to others, who have at least a curiosity to know, I would humbly request the candour of the public, while I exhibit a summary view of it for the satisfaction of inquirers.</P>
<P>This office, which I have accepted at the instance of many whom I much esteem, I am not insensible is as delicate as it is difficult for me to perform, as the innocent feelings of each one concerned are to be preserved unhurt, while truth and charity require that I deal faithfully with all.</P>
<P>To open the scene, then, to the greater advantage, I would beg leave to acquaint the reader, that the ground on which it has been acted was, no longer ago than twenty three years, an entirely uncultivated and howling wilderness; lying about forty miles north-east of Albany. The soil being rich and luxu∣riant, the situation high and sightly, in a pure and healthy air, was nevertheless very inviting to settlers. From small beginnings this town has arisen to consi∣derable eminence and importance, in regard both of the number of its inhabitants and wealth; and in regard of military prowess, Bennington is thought to be second to none on the continent.</P>
<P>The original proprietors were chiefly Congregati∣onal Separates, from different parts of New-Eng∣land,
<PB N="6" REF="017823_0004_0FA31997044D3240"/>
who being weary of the restraints of authority, and in fear of dwindling to nothing in their scattered situation, were willing to embody together, that they might act out their principles without restraint, and exhibit to the world the light of their religion.</P>
<P>This favorable spot was then chosen as the thea∣tre of their glory. While they were few in number and feeble in their circumstances, they were remarka∣ble for their love of one another. Besides this there have been seasons of especial awakening and attenti∣on here; and in the judgment of charity a happy number have been renewed and added to the Lord. This circumstance has contributed not a little to the gaining them respect and even fame abroad, as a re∣ligious people.</P>
<P>As a number of professors, not of the separate or∣der, have become inhabitants of the town, and have had great respect for the personal and ministerial en∣dowments of the Rev. Mr. DEWEY, who was of catholic and liberal principles, they have, at dif∣ferent periods joined the communion here.—And it is to be hoped that, by conversing with chris∣tians of other distinctions, and by a more liberal train of thinking, these walls of jealousy, shyness and se∣peration, which now divide professors, will soon be demolished; and gospel union and affection be re∣stored in the house of Christ's friends.</P>
<P>My worthy predecessor, who held his office here about fifteen years, was no sooner gathered to his fathers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">DEC, 21, 1778.</NOTE>, than the united attention of this people was turned upon me to become his successor. Ac∣cordingly I made them a visit in January 1780, when I was received with great warmth of affection. This visit I continued until the last of February, when the people were pleased to give me a call for settlement,
<PB N="7" REF="017823_0005_0FA3199800B993D0"/>
with only one dissentient in the church, and one in the congregation.</P>
<P>From this great union and good agreement, after they had had a fair opportunity of knowing my sen∣timents on religion, I was induced to think that here was laid a happy foundatson for my living in the af∣fections of the people, and for my being useful in this part of the vineyard, where labourers are very much needed. And being willing to make a sacri∣fice of other views and prospects, for the sake of doing this people good, I did, on the tenth of April, accept their invitation to settle here.</P>
<P>It being not my intention to descend to many mi∣nute circumstances in this narration, I should gladly pass the following one in silence, did it not claim par∣ticular notice, as it shows the nature, as well as the beginning of our confusions. The incident is this: That when, upon giving my answer to the people's call, I proposed that they would be pleased to appoint a day and a council for my instalment,—The Hon. JOHN FASSET, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who had objected against sending for me in the first place, and who had been uniformly against me all along, was pleased to object against its being done at present, it being cold and late in the day. And notwithstanding the appointment might have been made in less time than was consumed in shuffling it off, it was postponed from Monday until Friday.</P>
<P>And when the Friday-meeting came on, there appeared the strongest jealousy—That all was not right—that I held dangerous sentiments in my heart, which I was unwilling now to bring out, and that the people were taking a hasty step, which they might have occasion to tread back at a future period. This will be truly surprizing, when it shall be known, that as yet I had broached no one senti∣ment
<PB N="8" REF="017823_0006_0FA319992E097DF0"/>
different from what I had clearly discussed, to the entire satisfaction of the church, previous to their call. The consequence of all was, that after much had been done to give content and to save the credit of the church, five brethren were against my instal∣ment, and two or three professed to be neuters.</P>
<P>The incivility and the indeceney of this usage of a minister of Christ, and the interruption of the peace and harmony of the town, met with deserved rebuke from men of feeling here. And while this manoeuvre failed of gaining the conductors of it that applause, which it might have gained them if they had not over-acted their part, they had difficulty in retreating so as wholly to cover a design,—and to support their profession as "Israelites indeed, in whom is no guile."</P>
<P>This manoeuvre was no sooner over, and the heat of men's spirits abated, than the people very amica∣bly agreed in making the necessary appointments for the installation without opposition.</P>
<P>The third day of May was the time of our attend∣ing this solemnity. And when there appeared be∣fore the council but three dissenters in the church, and only one in the congregation, the opposition was so small that I made no scruple to renew my answer: which as it will give the reader an idea of my views, as well as of the manner of my induction, I beg leave to present him with it here.</P>

<HEAD>"To the church of Christ in Bennington.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>"Dear brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"INASMUCH as it hath pleased the great Head of the church to turn your early attention to me, in your destitute circumstances; and inasmuch as, af∣ter a full and fair trial of my ministerial qualifica∣tions
<PB N="9" REF="017823_0007_0FA319994EC16F70"/>
and endowments, you have very unanimously and very cheerfully invited me to take the pastoral watch and care of you, under the great Shepherd of the sheep, for your spiritual edification and comfort; and finally, inasmuch as this day of fasting and pray∣er is, by mutual consent, appointed for our uniting as pastor and church: I do now, in the presence of the living God, of the holy angels and of these wit∣nesses, most cheerfully espouse you as a church of visible believers; and I do hereby publish and de∣clare my hearty compliance with your invitation and call to become your pastor.</P>
<P>And inasmuch as I have heretofore been duly or∣dained an officer in Christ's kingdom, by "the lay∣ing on of the hands of the presbytery," whereby I am invested with full power and authority to admi∣nister sealing ordinances, and to do all the duties of a minister in God's house; and inasmuch as I can receive no new, nor even any accession of power by a re-ordination; I do now, without some of the u∣sual ceremonies of an instalment, thus publicly ac∣knowledge and declare myself to be under the most sacred vows to exercise my office, and to do all the duties of the pastor of this church, according to the tenor of the charge given to Timothy or Titus, or to any other pastor of new testament description, so long as God in his providence shall continue me with you. And, in reliance on divine grace, I do engage to exercise this my office for your edification and not destruction, that I may hope to present you as a chosen virgin to Christ, to whom I am to give account, that you and I may rejoice together at his appearing.</P>
<P>Upon this occasion, I hope that your goodness, my brethren, will suffer me to mention to you that I have great confidence in your zeal and faithfulness,
<PB N="10" REF="017823_0008_0FA3199A0653EF20"/>
that you will concur with me in every prudent mea∣sure for the reviving and supporting of church dis∣cipline, to the end that the erroneous may be cor∣rected, the vicious and the impenitent may be ex∣cluded, and that the just may be vindicated and en∣couraged; or, to speak in the language of the Apos∣tle Jude, "Of some have compassion, making a dif∣ference; and others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garments spotted by the flesh." In this way will you become conspicu∣ous as a city on a hill; and in this way will the "KING greatly desire your beauty."</P>
<P>Finally, my brethren, as you regard your own advancement, the best interest and good of others, and the glory of God in the kingdom of redemption, you will afford me the christian charity of your prayers, that I may be guided by the spirit of truth; that I may have fortitude and strength for every en∣counter; that I may defend the gospel against all opposers; that I may stand in an evil day; that I may make full proof of my ministry; that I may turn many to righteousness; and that at last I may meet the approbation of my Judge—"to whom be glory in the church by Christ Jesus, throughout all ages, world without end." Amen.</P>
<P>In the next place I would turn my address to the people of the congregation, who usually meet for public worship with the church here.</P>
<P>My dear friends,</P>
<P>Your cheerful and unanimous concurrence with the church, in calling me to labour in this part of the vineyard, hath been no small inducement to me to settle amongst you.</P>
<P>Inasmuch as the holy scriptures, and indeed the very nature of the thing, do manifestly make a dis∣tinction between an evangelist and a pastor; the lat∣ter
<PB N="11" REF="017823_0009_0FA3199AC5215AC0"/>
having relation to church, lead in the discipline of it, and the former having no such charge, I beg leave to avail myself of this distinct on now.</P>
<P>Upon this principle would I proceed therefore to declare, in the witnessing view of heaven and of this assembly, that I do very cordially accept your invitation to me to become your minister. And I do hereby engage to exercise my office as a preacher of the gospel amongst you, to notice your morals, to seek your best interest, and to watch for your souls and the souls of your children, as one who must give account to God.</P>
<P>And give me leave, my people, to assure you, in this public manner, that I have great pleasure in the thought that you will give your constant attend∣ance on my ministry; and that you will, in honour∣able and effectual ways, exert yourselves, with spirit, to encourage my heart and to strengthen my hands, in this good work which I have now undertaken for your benefit and salvation.</P>
<P>And, Oh! that my labours may not be in vain, as to any of you, my precious charge! While I shall be continued your minister, it will, I trust, be the af∣fectionate prayer of my heart, that you may be giv∣en me as the seal of my ministry, and as the crown of my rejoicing in the day of the Lord Jesus.</P>
<CLOSER>Amen and Amen."</CLOSER>

<P>When the eyes of the people thus saw their teach∣er, there was visibly a great and general joy, as might naturally be expected upon such an occasion. The noise and clamour, which before had been so great, being now husht to silence, and my opposers seeming unwilling to appear in arms, the people fe∣licitated themselves much in prospect of increasing delight in my ministry.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="017823_0010_0FA3199B86536A50"/>
But as bright and halcyon days seldom continue long without a cloud, so it was not long before this tranquility was greatly interrupted, when a rencoun∣ter commenced, in a way little expected by one un∣acquainted with such operations.</P>
<P>Some time in June, the head of the opposing par∣ty presented, to the church, a small list of grievan∣ces, arising from my preaching, which he desired might be accepted as a sufficient apology for his withdraw from the worship of God where I guided the assembly.</P>
<P>This gentleman pleaded, that although he could not and dared not say that my doctrines were un∣scriptural, yet, as he could not see them to be right, he judged that he ought not to be compelled to hear that which he deemed not for edification. Besides, he wished that, if he were in an error about my doc∣trines, or did not rightly apprehend my sentiments, the church would bear with his weakness and afford him help by conference; that he and they might yet walk together in love.</P>
<P>Although the church had no idea that this apolo∣gy ought to have been accepted by them, yet be∣ing willing to gratify a brother, in a case that re∣spected faith and conscience, they readily complied with the motion for a conference.</P>
<P>In managing this interview, the church were very particular in explaining the grounds and reasons of their belief in those points which were so stumbling to their brother. But their explanation was so far from yielding him satisfaction, that it appeared only to give an edge to his feelings. Hence there com∣menced a long and tedious dispute. But after a distressing trial of this expedient, Mr. Fasset was more dissatisfied, and more burdened, about my principles than before. But this was not all—by
<PB N="13" REF="017823_0011_0FA3199C44C23360"/>
this time, a number of others had collected courage enough to come out, and declare themselves dissatis∣fied with the same points that had been the ground of dispute now in the church.</P>
<P>While this conference made work and made way for one or two more, there was found no be∣nefit arising from it, except it was to see under whose banners one and another would appear. And the same may be said of almost every conference on the subject of grievances. For as the dissenting interest began now to gain credit and to lift up its head, so, at almost every conference, some new re∣cruit would be found paraded on the opposite side. And thus the church appeared to be daily dividing against itself, and to threaten a general convulsion.</P>
<P>In the mean time, if town fame is true, the leaders in the opposition sounded the feelings of many from house to house, thereby exciting the sympathy of weakness in their favour, because of their burdens and great distresses. So that there was little now to be heard, from any quarter, but the cry of grievances.</P>
<P>At length, being weary, by hearing the dolorous sound of uneasiness and discontent, and willing to make their patience and condescension as conspicu∣ous as their love of order, the church did, notwith∣standing confering had hitherto been quite unavail∣ing, so far yield to the dint of importunity as to con∣sent to meet them once more in conference. Ac∣cordingly, very early in January following, the church assembled to see if any thing more could be done, in this way, towards giving content to their troubled brethren. Care being had to the aggrieved's sense of the articles of their burden; and it being found that, in case the church should fail in clearing them up to their liking and acceptance, they would
<PB N="14" REF="017823_0012_0FA3199D060C7258"/>
continue still to absent themselves from my ministry, our situation became truly alarming; and we began now to apprehend danger from the very measures which we were pursuing with our brethren, who were bound to the same observance, of rule and or∣der as we were.</P>
<P>The church, upon this, needed very little time to consider that these articles of grievance, as they were stiled, were properly to be deemed articles of charge and complaint against the pastor, for mal∣administration. And by this time, their eyes were opened to see that they were going upon enchanted ground, while they were suffering charges to be brought thus against a brother, and especially against an elder, under the fallacious cloak of grievances, when there had been no private labour with the brother complained of, as a necessary and an indispensible pre-requisite to a public hearing of a case, of such nature and degree as to be made the ground of separation amongst brethren.</P>
<P>Accordingly, considering that no one hath right to be grieved with his brother, except for transgres∣sion—that, in case of transgression, it is antichristian and cruel to prosecute a brother publicly, before private influence has been exerted betwixt the par∣ties alone—that a church hath no right to hear a case of transgression debated, except in the appoint∣ed way of discipline:—Considering also, that the practice of telling grievances, which are real charges, is an abusive way of prosecuting a brother, contra∣ry to the dictates both of humanity and revelation—and that it hath a direct tendency to create fears, suspicions, jealousies, heart burnings, and alienati∣ons of affection, the bane and ruin of all intercouse, communion and happiness in a church—and finally being determined to support the credit of religion
<PB N="15" REF="017823_0013_0FA3199DC3FB93B8"/>
and the honor of their own profession:—the church, at last, very wifely resolved, that they would allow of this usage no more.</P>
<P>How painful, and how confounding to the views and schemes of our great advocates for the practice, now laid aside by the church, this resolution was, is hard to say. The most piteous out-cry was now made, that could well have been made, had the church voted against one of the first privileges of the kingdom of heaven. And notwithstanding the popular cry of tyranny and intolerance, the church have done themselves the honour hitherto to support, with fortitude, their good resolution.</P>
<P>The way being thus prepared, I urged upon my opposers, with great solemnity, that they should treat me according to Christ's law of discipline, in case I had transgressed, in my preaching, on the ac∣count of which they were so much offended as to turn their backs upon my ministry—to the end that they might appear to regard the divine authority, and that I might know my crime and repent.</P>
<P>But, being persuaded that they could not make a chargelye against me, and unwilling to hazard a le∣gal trial, in which, if they should fail, they must abide the consequences, they excused themselves from this irksome task, by saying that they did not know, and so did not choose to say, that I had transgressed, or that my preaching, in the least, erred from the divine word.</P>
<P>When they were reminded of what had been re∣peated to them times out of mind, that they could not be justified, in their withdrawing from the wor∣ship, and interrupting the communion by treating the pastor as an offender, for his preaching, unless they could shew that the pastor had erred, and that his preaching was corrupt; and that, in such case,
<PB N="16" REF="017823_0014_0FA3199E84C11250"/>
they could not be excused from so plain and so binding a duty as that of discipline—they replied, that inasmuch as the preaching was of public no∣toriety and exposed to every one's remark, the pri∣vate steps of discipline might lawfully be dispensed with.</P>
<P>But when they were reminded of the principles of the church on this head, that Christ's law of disci∣pline is not to be restricted to private offences and trespasses, but that it respects trespasses, as well pub∣lic as private, and may, in no case of trespass, be dis∣pensed with—and that every one who is guilty of trespass is entitled to the priviledge of being dis∣ciplined according to law—and that, they ought, therefore, to extend this privilege to the pastor, would they keep themselves in countenance, even if it were only their opinion that he had erred in his preaching:—they had the sagacity to avail them∣selves of a method, as extraordinary as their case now required to help them out of a pinch, which was, to deny that they considered me as a member of the church, over whom they were to exercise bro∣therly watch. This was their reasoning to make it out: That I was not a member unless a pastor of the church—that I was not a pastor unless ordain∣ed—that I was not ordained legally unless by the power of the brotherhood;—but inasmuch as my ordination was by the presbytery, by virtue of their own office-power without any investiture from the brotherhood—they could not see that I was an offi∣cer, nor that I belonged to their communion. And when they were reminded that as the subject of my ordination had been largely considered by the church and by themselves too, not only previous to my instalment but to their giving their call, and that my denying the right of ordination in the brother∣hood,
<PB N="17" REF="017823_0015_0FA3199F43FDCA20"/>
by no means invalidated my ordination by the presbytery, much less destroyed it, or made it out that it was no ordination: they answered that they had not so well considered this matter before, as they had since my introduction.</P>
<P>The principal actor being now struck off from the stage, the scene suddenly shifted, and assumed a new form, much to the surprize of the spectators, when the whole train of grievances was now brought in against the church, for their receiving me and my doctrines. Lay ordination, allowed by Cambridge platform and practised by many great and good men, and which is one of the principal bulwarks of the separate interest—the danger of sur∣rendering the privileges of the church into the hands of those who explode the power of the bro∣therhood in ordination—That by receiving a minis∣ter who does not fellowship the doctrine of lay or∣dination is building the things which they once de∣stroyed, and thereby making themselves transgress∣ors—were popular themes to harp upon, and like a vade-mecum, were always at command when occasi∣on called for them.</P>
<P>The church having now become the declared ob∣ject of our brethren's grief and uneasiness; and as it was proper that they should be allowed an oppor∣tunity of telling us ought that they had against us; the second day of March was appointed for a full audience, when every article, to be considered, should be stated in writing. The church met ac∣cordingly.</P>
<P>But when it was found that our brethren would not say that they were aggrieved, on the account of any transgression of the church; and that they were unwilling to treat those articles as grounds of disci∣pline; notwithstanding they could not walk with the
<PB N="18" REF="017823_0016_0FA319A00514E358"/>
church as they now were—considering also that bringing these articles against the church, when they had no iniquity to lay to their charge, was in reali∣ty, though under cover, obliquely prosecuting the pastor, as he was the mark to which all their arrows were still pointed; the church judged it not their duty to consume time in hearing complaints against themselves, any sooner than they would against a brother, unless they were for some bad conduct, ei∣ther real or supposed; and that it would be early enough for them to confer with the aggrieved when they should declare themselves aggrieved on the ac∣count of sin, either real or supposed.</P>
<P>However, considering that, by the unwarrantable measures now pursued, the doctrines of Christ were daily growing into disrepute; that the dignity of the ministerial office was hereby degraded and brought down to the dust of men's feet; and that the breach of friendship was constantly spreading itself like fire, and threatening general ruin to the church:—we proposed, in much condescension to our brethren, to call in the aid of mutual council, if peradventure they might do ought to save us, before our case should become incurable. The conditions were, that each party should chuse whom they pleased, and no one should fault his brother's choice. This motion was very readily agreed to, and a council appointed. The church appointed ministers of the standing or∣der, and the aggrieved ministers of the strict congre∣gational order, as the separates are stiled.</P>
<P>Our disputes being now referred to an enlighten∣ed and judicious board, in whom we placed great confidence, we enjoyed, for a moment, a little cessa∣tion; and we fondly felicitated ourselves on the prospect of our receiving much satisfaction from the gentlemen. But, in the mean time, the sending of
<PB N="19" REF="017823_0017_0FA319A0C65402A8"/>
our letters missive was unexpectedly delayed, for some weeks, when there were found plausible objec∣tions against our sending for the council at present. However, the church were quite happy in finding themselves able so far to surmount those huge diffi∣culties as to agree, the second time, to send for the men, whom they, according to accepted proposals, had chosen for counsellors.</P>
<P>But when the much wished for time for the session of council had arrived<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">25<HI>th of May</HI> 1781</NOTE>, we were made to know, by a very affecting providence, that it was not the de∣sign of Christ that there should yet be an end put to our troubles. For inasmuch as all the gentlemen ap∣pointed by the aggrieved failed, the other could do little more than to behold our misery and return, leaving us, like ship wrecked mariners, still buffet∣ed by the waves. A double gloom was now cast upon the face of our affairs; and indeed we walked in darkness and had no light!</P>
<P>The church, hitherto unwilling to cross the incli∣nations, the humours and prejudices of the aggriev∣ed, in any thing which they could with any colour avoid, lest they might seem to be inattentive to their comforts and delights, so far allowed them to rule as to omit the celebration of the Lords sup∣per untill now. But finding, upon trial, that this conformity to them was as fruitless as it was unwar∣rantable, it being turned into wantonness by them, the church felt themselves approved for their own folly, and on the first of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them communed toge∣ther, in this ordinance, for the first time since my in∣stalment.</P>
<P>But, notwithstanding the church professed to have communed with Christ, at his table,—to have sat under his shadow with great delight,—and to have
<PB N="20" REF="017823_0018_0FA319A186173058"/>
found his fruit sweet to their taste,—our aggrieved brethren took great umbrage at our conduct, stig∣matising it with the opprobrious epithets of prema∣ture, rash and unwarrantable, as well publicly as privately from house to house. However, had we waited longer for a settlement of the grievances, pre∣sented only in a way of complaining of certain things which they did not like, we might have left our gift at the altar until now, without know∣ing, in a legal way, that they had ought against us: For their telling us, not in a way of discipline, that they could not believe as the church did, re∣specting my introduction and doctrines; when at the same time they declared, that they were not grieved with the church on the account of sins; what was there for us to remember that our bre∣thren had against us? The truth is, that a church should never neglect a plain duty that good might come. The way of duty is the way of safety—and we are to expect light and comfort only in the way of the keeping of Christ's commandments. And "they who observe lying vanities, forsake their own mercy."<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Jonah ii. 8.</NOTE></P>
<P>Despairing now of the church's turning from the stedfastness of their purpose not to take cognizance of grievances, which were not on the account of sing our brethren judged it time to turn their at∣tention to other measures for redress. Accordingly, very early in autumn, they moved for a council of separate churches only, as the church had never professed to be in fellowship with any but those of this order.</P>
<P>But, considering that the time was now past for a council to prevent a rupture; that discipline ought to precede the dernier resort to council; that as
<PB N="21" REF="017823_0019_0FA319A245F90D80"/>
there had been made no complaint of error, nor of sin, we had no business proper for a council, as yet; and that, according to the proposal for having none but separates, our election could not be free, and so, af∣ter all, the council could not be mutually chosen: the church thought it not their duty to gratify them in their request.</P>
<P>But this denial having given no conviction to our brethren, either of the impropriety of their motion, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of their duty to be in subjection to the church, with whom they were bound to walk in charity, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all humility and reverence; they had the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of their own heads, to appoint and exparte <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of such churches as they had proposed for <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and appointment.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> scheme, however, they were far from <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> according to their wishes. For their coun∣cil <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of knowledge and integrity, and being <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> conviction that the rules of decency <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in church affairs, ought not to be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, to savor any private or party views, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to come at their call.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, the Rev. Mr. Palmer, at the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his brethren in the exparte appointment, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a visit to see how we did, and to know if <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> members had any reason or occasion <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> council's coming. And to gratify this gentleman, who had expressed so much love and concern for us, we spent a day in relating to him the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and progress of our disputes, from my first coming amongst this people, until then. And af∣ter a full hearing, on both sides, M. Palmer told the aggrieved plainly that he saw no reason why they should send for a council. This disappoint∣ment was as grievous, it may be presumed, as it was unexpected. However, like every thing else on
<PB N="22" REF="017823_0020_0FA319A376D4B288"/>
this subject, it unhappily failed in affording that conviction, which was fervently prayed it might af∣ford, to check their fiery ambition; although they were not a little mortified that their own measures had so unfortunately turned against their darling views.</P>
<P>The season following was remarkable for nothing more than the production of two additional articles of grievance, though not on account of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the church. These were made the pretext for calling the church together, some time in May, when, a∣vailing themselves of them, together with all the o∣ther articles, which still disturbed the peace of their conferences as much as ever, our zealous brethren, with great warmth, renewed their application for a council. But being unwilling to countenance a motion, which now savoured strongly of a desire in them, not so much to gain light as to be availed of in∣fluence, by which they might hope to have their own measures sanctified and they themselves placed a∣bove the reach of blame; although we had no un∣easy apprehensions from that quarter; and consi∣dering that there still existed the same objections a∣gainst our sending now for a council, as there did last fall when we rejected this motion; and indeed being filled with a sense that our own dignity, that propriety and decency would not allow us to treat the ordinance of councils with so great disrespect, as to send for one, when it had been already judged, that we had nothing prepared to be laid before any board from abroad: the church was obliged, upon principle, once more to deny them.</P>
<P>Finding themselves foiled and baffled in all their attempts for a council, our brethren had now but little hope of succeeding in the course which they held; and, it seems that, they would have been
<PB N="23" REF="017823_0021_0FA319A3EA76E150"/>
quite in despair, had not the supposed goodness of their cause been to them as a reviving cordial to keep up their spirits, while they imagined that God would yet appear for them, and bring light out of present darkness.</P>
<P>Of this desponding countenance was a request, as absurd as it was extraordinary, which they made to the church, in the beginning of fall, that we would dismiss them in regular standing and in chris∣tian fellowship, that they might be a church by them∣selves. The impropriety, if not the impossibility, of our granting this request to those, who had virtually if not formally renounced our fellowship, and whose only reason for this motion was, that the church held to such a faith and practice as that they could not commune with us, appears evidently at first blush. For if they could not hold fellowship with us when we were related to each other as members of one body; how could they do it when we should be divided in∣to two? Besides, we were persuaded that the laws of God's house make no provision for a church's di∣viding on points which prevent, not only the higher acts of communion at the table, but even their pray∣ing and worshiping together, either upon the sab∣bath or any other day; except by regular discipline; but then not in fellowship. To suppose the contrary would be to make professors covenant breakers ac∣cording to law. But this is both absurd and im∣possible.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding all this, so intent had the church hitherto been on making their patience, their forbearance and their condescension as great, as was their brethren's want of these virtues, they would have attended to any arguments which might have been offered on the subject, had not their own con∣duct rendered it inadmissible. For as one of the
<PB N="24" REF="017823_0022_0FA319A484D30028"/>
signers of their request was under public discipline, in a very heavy charge of heresy and scandal, their petition carried in it a request that we would acquit him of this charge when he had done nothing to sa∣tisfy it. And when they were reminded of this in∣delicacy and impropriety, so far were they from a disposition to expunge his name, and leave his case to be decided in the church without them, that they chose rather to stand or fall together, as the die might be cast.</P>
<P>In the mean time, as they allowed the sentiments to be just which their brother was charged with broaching and maintaining; although they granted that he had been imprudent in declaring them; they were not a little interested in the trial depending, and repeatedly urged the bringing of it on. This indeed was necessary in order to their knowing what step to take next.</P>
<P>The trial of this brother was no sooner issued, in the church, than it was judged that there must be issued other measures besides those on which they had hitherto placed dependence. Accordingly they instantly circulated, through the church, a subscrip∣tion, requesting a meeting "to see if the church would agree to call a council of churches, known by the name of strict congregational churches, to look into the difficulties then subsisting in this church, and to give their advice agreeable to Cam∣bridge platform and our covenant."</P>
<P>After this paper had obtained the names of one half of the church, it was brought to me, for my direction. And, passing unnoticed the indignity of this low ceremony of jealousy, I warned a meeting according to orders; but with less cheerfulness, than I should have done the same business, had only one or two made this request.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="017823_0023_0FA319A54490A7C8"/>
It being now found, when the church came toge∣ther, that my friends were overpowered by numbers, and considering that disputing would be more likely to stir up wrath, than to convince those who could show a majority, the council was appointed, accord∣ing to desire, without indecorum.</P>
<P>Although I saw no necessity, nor any regularity or propriety in this appointment, as our affairs were circumstanced—and although no one was under any obligation to plead, in defence, before the council, as there had been no legal process to lay any under such obligations:—Yet being willing to embrace so favourable an opportunity for propagating light, as well for the satisfaction of the spectators as of the council: I complied with the desire of my friends so far as to give a stating of facts, as they had happened, and to correct such mistakes and misrepresentations as might be made, in handling the several points set up, by our aggrieved brethren.</P>
<P>That which has been improved as the occasion of so much uneasiness and debate, and of interrupting the communion here; and been the occasion of so great a noise through the country; to the no small disadvantage of the gospel, and to the wounding of religion, may be seen, as it is judiciously drawn up in the following result of council, which now in∣vites the reader's attention.</P>

The council chose the Rev. E. Wright mode∣rator, and J. Spalding for be.</P>
<P>The council being opened with prayer, proceeded to hear the Rev. Mr. Avery give a narration of the various steps, by which the differences have arisen which now subsist in the church. Several articles of grievance were then laid before the council, by a number of the brethren of the church, and the day being spent, the council adjourned until eight o'clock the next morning.</P>
<P>May 27th, the council met, according to adjourn∣ment, opened with prayer, and proceeded to hear discussed the article of grievance respecting the church's departing from their covenant and plat∣form, in receiving the Rev. Mr. Avery as their minister.</P>
<P>The council having carefully attended to this ar∣ticle of complaint or grievance, are of the opinion that the church have not departed from their cove∣nant or platform, in receiving the Rev. Mr. Avery as their minister; and that there is no just cause of grievance on that account.</P>
<P>Secondly, The council proceeded to hear the fol∣lowing articles of grievance or complaint against the church, for their receiving certain doctrines, de∣livered by Mr. Avery, as sound and orthodox, which they the aggrieved members look upon as er∣roneous: which doctrines, for substance, are as follows—</P>
<P N="1">1. That whatever an unregenerate man does, as a moral agent, is sin.</P>
<P N="2">2. That Christ's intercession, in the court of heaven, is such as now operates against all the views, schemes, and evil designs of the wicked, and will at last terminate in the utter ruin and overthrow of finally impenitent sinners.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="27" REF="017823_0025_0FA319A6C645A6E0"/>
3. That a man can do all that God requires of him, if he is but willing: or, in other words, that moral ability consists in the will.</P>
<P>The council having carefully examined what has been said for and against these doctrines, are of opi∣nion that they are agreeable to divine revelation.</P>
<P>Thirdly, The council attended to the general run of the doctrines received by the church, as being mere speculation.</P>
<P>As to this, we are of the opinion that those who make this complaint are blameable!</P>
<P>Fourthly, The complaint relative to the church's receiving Leonard Robinson to their communion, after he had been set by for several years, although there had been no charge against him, was laid before the council.</P>
<P>Careful attention being paid to this article, we are of the opinion that the church did right in their re∣ceiving Mr. Robinson again to their communion.</P>
<P>Fifthly, The Rev. Mr. Avery was accused to the council, as saying—To make our appeal to creeds and confessions of faith, as tests of orthodoxy, in∣stead of making it to the bible, in any cause respect∣ing revelation, is more becoming papists than pro∣testant christians.</P>
<P>The council having heard Mr. Avery explain himself, as to this matter, are of the opinion that there was, in this, no just cause of offence.</P>
<P>Sixthly, The discipline of the church, respecting Mr. Simeon Sears, was submitted to the council for their opinion.</P>
<P>This being considered, we are of the opinion that the church's procedure against Mr. Sears was just.</P>
<P>We would now address ourselves to the pastor and brethren of this church.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="017823_0026_0FA319A78417B6D8"/>
Reverend and Beloved,</P>
<P>It is with the greatest sensibility that we feel for you, in your trials. You cannot but be sensible that sin is the cause of all the troubles into which you are plunged. And from a conviction that sin is the cause of these evils, let every one examine his own heart and say, what have I done?</P>
<P>It seems that the design of the instituted means of grace is much frustrated amongst you—gospel ordi∣nances brought into contempt—the heart of the righteous made sad—and the bands of the wicked strengthened—through your divisions; which will prove bitterness to you in the latter end.</P>
<P>We would therefore earnestly recommend to you to put away all sinful strife and contentions; and each one, for himself, walk with God, in the tem∣per of his heart, and tenor of his life, as the only way that will bring you to walk together in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>Furthermore, considering the embarrassments, the disadvantages and discouragements, that must ne∣cessarily attend the Rev. Mr. Avery, in prosecuting his ministry in this place, and the little prospect that you or Mr. Avery can have, of his being instrumen∣tal of uniting this people—we would recommend it to you, as our advice, that, if Mr. Avery shall re∣quest the same, you would dismiss him from his pastoral charge over you; that he may be at liberty to serve God in his generation, in the work of the ministry, where he may have a greater prospect of doing good than he has with you—and you also may be at liberty to seek for yourselves another pastor, in whom you can be better agreed.</P>
<P>We would also take this method to declare our esteem for Mr. Avery, as a minister of Jesus Christ;
<PB N="29" REF="017823_0027_0FA319A843E93880"/>
and, as such, we do freely recommend him to the acceptance of all God's people.</P>

<P>The moderator then, in the presence of the coun∣cil, delivered the following admonition, to which they all gave consent. A copy has since been giv∣en us for the press.</P>
<Q><P>"I think it my duty, before I take my leave of you, to address myself, in a particular manner to the aggrieved brethren, as they are called.</P>
<P>Beloved brethren,</P>
<P>From what I have seen and heard, in the course of the trials which have been depending before this council, I am very deeply concerned for you and for the church in this place. I hope you will allow me to express my concern for you, in dealing plainly and faithfully with you. It may be this will be the last opportunity that I shall ever have to see you or to speak to you; and I am unwilling to go away without leaving my testimony with you.</P>
<P>In the first place, then, I have to tell you, that those doctrines exhibited to the council, which you deny to be doctrines according to godliness, I esteem to be some of the great truths revealed in the word of God. I have believed them, and preached them for many years; and I have known them to be owned and blest of God for the awakening, and I trust for the conversion of many souls, especially in the place where I live.</P>
<P>In your opposing these doctrines, it appears to me that, you are opposing some of the great truths, on which the faith and hope of the people of God depend. If we give up these doctrines, we do, in effect, give up the whole system of divine truths.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="017823_0028_0FA319A9045F4B10"/>
And notwithstanding you may thing yourselves honest and upright, in opposing Mr. Avery in these doctrines, I earnestly beseech you to consider whe∣ther you are not really doing the devil's work. Sa∣tan is endeavouring, various ways, and by any means that he can make use of, to root up the gos∣pel to destroy it from off the face of the earth: and what must the unhappiness of those be that serve him herein?</P>
<P>Furthermore, consider, I pray you, whether, by your means, the gospel will not be driven away from Bennington; and this people be deprived of the means and ordinances of grace, whereby many poor souls may perish eternally, and their blood be required at your hands.—I really think, my brethren, that you have reason to fear that this may be the case.—I therefore seriously entreat you not to think light of it.</P>
<P>In the next place, your neglecting your duty as members of this church, your not attending the or∣dinances, the order and rule of God's house, fills me with painful apprehensions for you. I have known several churches, that were as flourishing for a sea∣son as any, perhaps, in the land, that by letting in such disputes and contentions, and indulging a spirit of division and seperation, have gone on to bite and devour one another, till they have been consumed one of another, and not the least appearance of a visible church left.</P>
<P>While I have these things in view, and consider∣ing the circumstances that this church is in, at pre∣sent, I have the greatest reason to fear that this may be your case here in Bennington; and that you will become like Shiloh of old, when the ark was taken from them. God is with his people while they hearken to his voice and obey his word: but if they
<PB N="31" REF="017823_0029_0FA319A9C3D20AE8"/>
walk contrary to him, he will walk contrary to them, and repent of the good wherewith he said he would benefit them.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Lev. xxvi. 23, 24. Jer. xviii. 10.</NOTE></P>
<P>Be entreated therefore, my brethren, to stop and consider your ways, lest, if you go on as you have done, you may repent when it will be too late!</P>
<P>Thus, brethren, I must take my leave of you, praying that God, of his sovereign grace and mercy, would direct and preserve you in the way that you should go."</P></Q>
<P>When, upon this occasion, the moderator put to vote the doings of council, my friends accepted of every article; but the aggrieved brethren accepted of none but the first.</P>
<P>Now finding that, notwithstanding my opposers were thus confounded by their own measures, they still maintained, in full strength, their aversion to my doctrines and discipline; and that their ear could not be gained by all the eloquence and persuasion of the worthy council of their own choice, the appoint∣ment of which they had obtained with so much ad∣dress, I could not long hesitate what part to act.</P>
<P>Accordingly, being persuaded of the truth of the wiseman's maxim, as well in regard of the people as of myself, that "Better is a dry morsel, and quiet∣ness therewith, than a house full of sacrifices with strife,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Prov. xvii 1.</NOTE> I resigned my office here the 17th of June; but not without the liveliest sense of grief for the very unhappy necessity which compelled me to do it.</P>

Master to support the dignity of my office, and to preserve my usefulness in his kingdom: Inasmuch as my engagements are such as do not forbid a discharge from my pastoral care of you, when it is deemed, by a proper board, that my usefulness is obstructed beyond the rational prospect of its being recovered amongst you: inasmuch as the late ecclesiastical council, from a survey of our affairs, have, of their own ac∣cord, judged that there are such embarrassments, dis∣advantages and discouragements attending the pro∣secuting my ministry here, that neither you nor I can have much prospect of my uniting this divided people: inasmuch at the council, from these consi∣derations, have advised that I might be dismist from my present connexions, in case I shall request it: inasmuch as one half of this church are divided from me, without any prospect of my recovering them; and there is found here a very surprising inattention to my settlement and salaries, by many of those who have covenanted to pay them; whereby, as effec∣tually as by any other means, my studies and my usefulness are not a little interrupted: and inasmuch as the divine glory and my highest duty call upon me to request that I may be at liberty to serve God, in the gospel, where I may have a greater prospect of doing good than I have with you: I do now, in the fear of God, resign my pastoral charge of you in∣to the hands of the Chief Shepherd, who, for a little <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> than three years past, hath seen fit to entrust me <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it. And I do hereby request, that you will henceforward consider the relation between us as dissolved and void.</P>
<P>Allow me, my brethren, upon this occasion, to assure you, that as your good <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> special has always lain very near my heart while I have had the charge of this church: so now, at resigning it, I am mov∣ed

with the tenderest compassion for you and for your children. The hardships which I have endured for your sakes, and the trials which I have suffer∣ed, by reason of your divisions, your disputes, your contentions, your emulations, your strifes and your disorders, in the course of there three years past, truly exceed description—One day will reveal how ready I have been to spend and to be spent for you; and that in me you have had a friend.</P>
<P>Allow me, hence, to indulge in the pleasure of the hope, that those of you who respect my minis∣try will still remember the great doctrines of grace, which I have constantly taught you; and that you will act upon that plan of christ an discipline which I have ever urged and stedfastly maintained, at the no small expence of character and case. And let us pray one for another, and prepare to meet in that better world where brethren dwell together in unity.</P>

<P>IT has been in my heart to live and to die with you. This I should still be free to do, were there now a prospect of the continuance of my usefulness, as there was when I first came amongst you. But the bright and promising prospects, which we con∣templated with so much pleasure at first, being now obscured and cut off, I am compelled by the severest necessity to relinquish my connexions here, that I

<P>As you have been constant spectators and even actors in the affecting scene in which I have shared such a variety of misfortunes, you are not ignorant of the embarrassments and discouragements which attend my ministry here. And I cannot but do you the justice to suppose that you are of the same opi∣nion with the late council, that the end of my mi∣nistry is so much frustrated, that it is beyond my power to do you that good, which you need to have done you by a minister of Christ. In this view of things, I am persuaded that you will justify me, when I resign my ministerial watch over you, and request you to consider the relation between us as null and void.</P>
<P>Upon this occasion, I beg leave to return my best thanks to you, for all that attention and respect which you have been pleased to show me, in the course of my connexions with you. And, from the feelings of my own heart, I am ready to hope that a remembrance of mutual good offices will be reciprocal and perpetual between us. Above all, allow me to hope, my dear friends, that you will never dispute nor reject those interesting doctrines which you have been taught from my lips, and which have been so much discredited by my mis∣judging brethren; that so I may not be "the savour of death unto death to you!"<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2.

<P>PERMIT us to assure you that the sad occa∣sion of this address, in answer to the resignation of your ministerial watch over us, affects us in the most tender manner.</P>
<P>We have anxiously felt for you, in your embar∣rassments and perplexities; and it has been with great grief and concern, that we have been witnes∣ses of those dissentions, in the church, which neces∣sitate you to be at liberty from us.</P>
<P>But when we consider these unhappy divisions—that inattention to the very solemn reproof and ad∣monition of the late council which is observable in the opposing party; and that the measures used for uniting them in the bonds of christian love are with∣out effect—we are persuaded, Sir, that the great duties of your office justify your departure from us. And while we lament the causes which have led to

<P>Notwithstanding, should it seem good in the eyes of the Lord to soften the hearts of those who have risen up against you without a cause, so that your usefulness and comfort might be preserved and pro∣moted amongst us, nothing can give us a greater satisfaction, than the continuance of your ministry in this place.</P>
<P>It give us pain when we reflect upon the wretch∣ed circumstances into which we shall be involved, by our being deprived of a regular ministry, and the danger there is, that our children and others amongst us will be led away to hearken to men for teachers, destitute of those virtues which form the christ an and the real ministers of God; whereby they will be rendered unamiable in life, and exposed to misery in the world to come. In consequence of these our apprehensions, we do earnestly entreat you to continue the exercise of your ministry with us, in case the measures of the church shall be such as comport with your duty.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, if you shall judge it not your duty to continue with us, it is our earnest desire that the divine blessing may attend you and your labours, wherever you may be called; that the Lord of hosts will hold you as a polished shaft in his quiver; and still promote your usefulness in his church.</P>
<P>Upon this occasion, we beg leave to return you our sincere thanks for the painful and laborious ex∣ecution of your office with us, for more than three years past. At the same time we assure you that whatever arrearages remain unpaid for your services,

<P>Thus has closed a scene which has made as dis∣agreeable, as it has an unusual display, on the chris∣tian theatre. While the actors on one part have been intent on a favourite point, those on the other part have contended earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints. Who has acted a part worthy of imi∣tation, is left to the reader's judgment—and whose eye has been single, in conducting this scene, is humbly refered to the judgment of the great day.</P>
<P>I have now only to make a remark or two, and then I shall put an end to this writing.</P>
<P N="1">1. I cannot but be of the opinion, that a princi∣pal occasion of our confusions has been a neglect of church discipline.</P>
<P>Had discipline been seasonably and duly observ∣ed, it would, without doubt, have blasted, in the bud, those evils which have brought forth so much cor∣rupt fruit. This would have prevented our bre∣thren's taking up a cause of uneasiness with my preaching, unless they had against it reasons suf∣ficient to justify a public declaration. And, in such case, they would not have made any public declara∣tion
<PB N="38" REF="017823_0036_0FA319AF04306728"/>
before they had used private influence to re∣cover me from error. In this way, communion would not have been interrupted, and the peace and union of the church would have remained.—And I beg leave to add, that had the church turned their forbearance into discipline, they would either have gained their brethren, or else have excluded them from their communion according to law; and so have preserved the dignity and order of God's house.—But, alas, the day in which we live is a day when it is imagined that church discipline savours rather of a hard and unchristian disposition, than of that love and faithfulness which constitute the bro∣ther of Christ. Hence, honest men, who know their duty, are too much inclined to neglect this ordi∣nance through fear of offence. But this is their weakness, and it calls for mourning, as well as it does that it should be shrewdly given out, in vari∣ous ways, that the great law of brotherly love is dangerous to the union and peace of churches.</P>
<P>When churches put up with evils, which require discipline, thinking thereby to get along, some how, as it is often exprest, would do well to consider that there is no getting along, in Christ's kingdom, but by keeping his commandments; and that when these are neglected, churches ly still, or rather go back, and are making work for repentance. Should the instance before us convince the reader of the truth of this remark, it will be found that he has read our affecting story not in vain.</P>
<P N="2">2. To revive and support the established order of God's house, is an object of the first importance to command the attention and the zeal of christians.</P>
<P>Every one ought to "mark well, and behold with his own eyes, and hear with his ears all that
<PB N="39" REF="017823_0037_0FA319AFC4400728"/>
God says unto him concerning all the ordinances of the house of the Lord, and all the laws thereof, and mark well the entering in of the house, with every going forth of the sanctuary."<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xliv. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE> And the word of God, in all cases, is to be obeyed, as the only rule of conduct in his house. This being regarded will raise up the church from her low state, and make her shine in all the beauties of holiness. Adopting any other system, and acting upon any other max∣ims, however plausible, and however celebrated they may be, will utterly fail in reducing men to the or∣der of the house. To the law and to the testimony, therefore; "if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them."<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Isa. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iii <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE> Let every matter of faith and practice be decided by this standard, and the church cannot fail in the uni∣formity and goodness of her profession. And when∣ever this shall be done, all iniquity will stop its mouth, and the church will keep herself pure, as a chaste virgin, for Christ. And then it will be found to be a divine PRIVILEGE to be a member of the church, when every member will be treated ac∣cording to law, without fear from brethren, when they have no sin to lay to his charge,—for "in that day there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the Lord of hosts."<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> The church being composed of such as shall be saved, she will keep the unity of the Spirit, in the bond of peace, and seek those things whereby one may edify another. When the Lord shall thus "beautify the place of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sanctuary, and shall make the place of his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> glorious, then the sons of them that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the church shall come bending unto her, and all <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that despise her shall bow themselves down at the

soles of her feet; and they shall call her The city of the Lord, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isa. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x. 13, 14.</NOTE> Who then can withhold his hand from a work so interesting and so important as the raising up the church in her order and glory! In this great de∣sign many hands are employed—the wisdom of the learned, and the eloquence of the orator. And in this work is displayed the unparrallelled love and zeal of the Lord himself. This is his own decla∣ration. "For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, un∣till the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth."<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isa lxii. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>Having this glorious object in view, how can christians sit with folded hands and take their rest, when "the hedges" of Zion "are broken down, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?"<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Psal. lxxx. 12.</NOTE> Without discipline a church soon becomes like "the field of the slothful, and the vineyard of the man void of understanding,—all grown over with thorns, and nettles covering the face of it, and the stone wall thereof broken down."<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Prov xxiv. 30, 31.</NOTE> And indeed it is hard for us to see that physic is more necessary for the body, or regulations for an army, than dis∣cipline for a church. For without the former, dis∣order will prey upon the constitution, exhaust na∣ture and terminate in death. And without the lat∣ter, all the distinction which we give to the idea of an army is confounded and even lost in con∣fusion, mutiny, desertion, obstinacy, uproar, and a wild ungovernable mob; utterly unfit for service, affording no defence to any nation, state or king∣dom. In this view, I must say that discipline is even essential to the well being of a christian church.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="017823_0039_0FA319B144402668"/>
And as a church is especially different from wordly society only by her discipline, she must sus∣tain character amongst men accordingly as she sup∣ports or neglects this ordinance. And thus shall there be found a difference "between him that serveth God, and him that serveth him not"<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Mal. iii. 18.</NOTE> And when professors of religion shall gain the noble dis∣tiction of serving God in this way, they may with confidence look up and say unto him—"Thou shalt arise and have mercy upon Zion; for the time to fa∣vour her, yea, the set time is come. For thy ser∣vants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof."<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Psal. cii. 13, 14.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>ADDRESS To those who have stedfastly adhered to my minis∣try in Bennington.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS you have a joint interest with me in the sceene now described, I beg leave to address you, in particular, on the subject, at my parting with you.</P>
<P>My heart being filled with the tenderest sympathy, I do sincerely condole with you, in your present af∣fliction. By matters being brought to this crisis. I am sensible that your views and expectations are cut off equally as my own. And notwithstanding peo∣ple are wont to feel little concern in affairs foreign to them, yet I am persuaded that the history of your troubles, as it is a history of human nature, will not fail to excite in persons of sensibility the liveliest pity and compassion for you; especially if they themselves have experienced the like misfortune. But that which is most needful for you is to make a wise improvement of the dispensation which so
<PB N="42" REF="017823_0040_0FA319B275021568"/>
much affects you. I hope that you will, therefore, allow me to testify my love to you, in that frank∣ness which becomes the friend and the christian, by giving you such advice as your circumstances make me think will be not improper for you.</P>
<P N="1">1. Adore that holy hand which hath effected those events by which we are obliged to part.</P>
<P>This is the believer's challenge; "Shall there be evil in a city, and the Lord hath not done it?" And not only revelation, but even nature itself teacheth the same doctrine. "Ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee: or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee; and the fishes of the sea shall de∣clare unto thee: who knoweth not in all these, that the hand of the Lord hath wrought this."<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Job xii. 7—9.</NOTE></P>
<P>While you consider that you have to do with God in these concerns, you will be happily guarded against fretting at second causes. Second causes are in his hand, as instruments of discipline and correc∣tion; and great good may come to you by them. "The Lord's voice crieth unto the city, and the man of wisdom shall see his name; hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it."<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Micah vi. 9.</NOTE> Hence say with Eli, in his affliction, "It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.."<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. iii. 18.</NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. Consider the reason you have to be humbled under this rebuke.</P>
<P>It has been easy to foresee that a rupture must have been the consequence of the spirited measures which have uniformly operated against my continu∣ance here, unless checked by discipline, and opposed as well by a manly neglect as by reasoning. But while your charity, and reluctance to put forth such
<PB N="43" REF="017823_0041_0FA319B2C427D7C0"/>
exertion, have been conspicuous, the opposition has constantly gained ground, and supported itself with courage. And now we may well say with Jeremiah in his lamentations; "Certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen it."<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lam. ii. 16.</NOTE> And if this chastening brings to your remembrance any inattention to your duty, in the course of your troubles, allow me to hope that you will admit the conviction, and be humbled under the rod.</P>
<P N="3">3 Be patient under God's hand.</P>
<P>"Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy."<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">James v. 11.</NOTE> The day may come when you will see good come out of this evil, and the glory of God greatly promoted by it. And if you walk in darkness and have no light about the issue and event of this providence, yet remember that there is sufficient reason for you to trust in the name of the Lord, and to stay upon God.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Isa. 1. 10</NOTE> "Then be ye followers of them who through faith and pa∣tience inherit the promises."<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Heb. vi. 12.</NOTE> They have with one voice said, "We glory in tribulation, knowing that tribulation worketh patience."<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Rom. v. 3.</NOTE> "If when you do well and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God."<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. ii. 20.</NOTE></P>
<P>Consider that the time has not yet come, when satan shall be bound, and he make havock of the church no more. But as the time fixed upon by the prophets when his influence shall be destroyed, draweth nigh, "he has come down unto the inha∣bitants of the earth and of the sea, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time."<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rev. xii. 12.</NOTE> The rapid increase of discord amongst bre∣thren—
<PB N="44" REF="017823_0042_0FA319B38490CED8"/>
the sly measures used to shun the rules of God's house▪ the spirit of division and contention, of emulation and strife—the corrupt principle em∣braced and supported against the plain sense of the scriptures the perverseness, the willfulness and the unreclaimableness of men's tempers—the growth of vice, the abounding of lust, the spread and preva∣lence of infidelity, of heresy and hardness of heart—the airs of insult assumed over conscientious men, the friends of the antient faith and manners—the unbridled covetousness which is now arrayed in all its terrors against the gospel, which so signally mark the men of this generation—all loudly proclaim that little rest may be enjoyed, at present, except you become conformed to this world, and court their friendship. But you had better suffer all the terrors that antichrist <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> than do that And as things are now taking place, it becomes you to gird on the harness and prepare for war. Arm yourselves, therefore, with patience, that you may endure to the end. "Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him, fret not" yourselves "because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass."<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal. lxxxvii. 7.</NOTE></P>
<P N="4">4. Be aware of a separateing spirit.</P>
<P>From the many awful displays of this spirit, made before your eyes, in the course of a few years past, as well before as since I came amongst you, there is more reason why you should fear it, than there is that you should fear "the pestilence that walketh in darkness, or the destruction that wasteth at noon∣day."<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Psal. xci. 6.</NOTE> This spirit always feels independent of its neighbours; and is intent only upon its own inte∣rest and humour. It never esteems another better
<PB N="45" REF="017823_0043_0FA319B446653CD0"/>
than itself; and it seldom blushes to make its own goodness a standard for its brother. Hence it is not uncommon for this spirit to affect great compas∣sion for the blindness and the small experiences of its fellow-professors. In various ways it calls upon beholders to admire its shining excellencies; and in as many ways it is wont to show displeasure if they withhold their applause. It "loves the up∣permost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the market,"<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Luke ii. 43.</NOTE> as though these of right belonged to it. It assumes, with airs, the dictator's chair; and is not unwilling to give laws to inferiors. And if you dispute this prerogative, it scruples not to adopt that all-convincing reasoning, "I am holier than thou."<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Isa. lxv. 5.</NOTE> And the least disobedience to this evil spirit is, at any time, a sufficient reason for its withdraw∣ing from you, as though you were unworthy of its communion. And then the discipline of shyness, jealousy, murmuring, unsociableness, surliness, sour∣ness, unkindness, unmercifulness, and complaining, is the ordinance of your reformation. As this spi∣rit never gathers with Christ, it always scatters abroad, contrary to the whole strain of the scriptures. And what is surprising is, that it delights in being alone, when it can exclude all others as not necessa∣ry to its happiness.</P>
<P>When I consider that the spirit of the gospel is a uniting spirit <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that it is the desire of Christ that all his people "may be one, that they may be made perfect in one;" and that this union made manifest in life is designed as the great mean of conviction to the world that his mission was from heaven▪ when I consider also the great stress which is laid upon the doctrine of union, in the scriptures, as, "Be
<PB N="46" REF="017823_0044_0FA319B5063B5A28"/>
of one mind." "Be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment." "Let us stand fast in one spirit." "Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity." "Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences, contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them." I say, when I consider these things, and how great a stress is laid upon this doctrine, which all believers receive in the love of it—I hesitate not to pronounce upon a separating spirit, that it is an∣tichristian spirit, and ought to be avoided as the bane of churches.</P>
<P>You cannot, therefore, my friends, have too great an abhorrence of this spirit, in whomsoever it may, at any time, appear. You ought to guard against it with diligence, and crush the first risings of it amongst you. If it be let alone very long, it will become head-strong, and utterly unmanageable, like the wild Gadarene, whom no man could tame.</P>
<P>Introduced with this unholy and dangerous spirit is a train of evils of the foulest character. Its na∣tural and constant attendants are, "debates, envy∣ings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swel∣lings, tumults." And whenever you shall see this troop of furies arise, stand in awe and dread the consequences. For if every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation: and if no city or house divided against itself shall stand: know you for certain, that when a spirit of division shall have dominion over you, then destruction will be even at your door. "If ye bite and and devour one another, saith the apostle, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another."</P>
<P N="5">5. Seek after gospel order and walk in it.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="017823_0045_0FA319B5C4701FA8"/>
The blessings of order are so numerous, so great, and so precious, that it is truly astonishing that it does not more command the attention of believers. Its lines are drawn with so much clearness and pre∣cision; and its distinguishing marks are so plain and easy to be seen; that it seems to require invention to avoid it. To every humble and honest disciple, the way of duty is obvious enough: so that "the way-faring men, though fools, shall not err therein." Hence young children, and persons of very scanty capacities may easily be convicted of perverseness, and wilful blindness when they refuse to walk in it. This is the covenant.</P>
<P>"Thine eyes shall see thy teachers: and thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left." "The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way. All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies." And as "God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of saints:" so his peculiar people are distinguished from others by their love and practice of peace and order.</P>
<P>Indeed this is an article of such estimation in the scriptures, that "in this the children of God are ma∣nifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that lov∣eth not his brother." Of your duty on this head, this is the sum: "Thou shall not hate thy brother in thine heart; thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him." "If thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. But if he will not
<PB N="48" REF="017823_0046_0FA319B68578E100"/>
hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican." "Withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly. If any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be a∣shamed" "Mark them which cause divisions, con∣trary to the doctrine which ye have learned, and a∣void them." "I have written to you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolator, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner—with such an one, no not to eat.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">If any reader shall imagine that we are prohibited eating with an excommunicant, at the Lord's table only—let him consider—that we are to have NO company with him—surely then, not the HIGHEST and MOST HONORABLE kind of company. Otherwise we shall make our apostle read thus absurdly—with such an one NO, not even to eat the Lord's supper, as that is the GREATEST act of communion that christians ever perform on earth.—Besides, this restriction respects our treatment of a man, cal∣led a brother, when he is cast out of the church. With others, even the fornicators of this world, we may eat: but if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator—with such an one, no not to eat. But while he was in the church, every brother might eat with him.</NOTE>"</P>
<P N="6">6. Display, upon all occasions, true greatness of mind.</P>
<P>This is necessary in order to your shining in that religion which will make you the light of the world. And it is to be wished, that you may appear to the best advantage, that others beholding "your good works may glorify your Father who is in heaven."</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="017823_0047_0FA319B745AD56B0"/>
Narrowness and contraction are not more un∣aimiable or even contemptible in the eyes of men, than they are unfavourable to a religious character. Hence, under the reign of righteoussness, when there will be light sufficient to exhibit and to distinguish characters with clearness,—</P>
<P>"The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl said to be bountiful. For the vile person will speak villainy, and his heart will work iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and to utter error against the Lord, to make empty the soul of the hun∣gry, and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail. The instruments of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked devices, to destroy the poor with lying words, even when the needy speaketh right." And yet this same vile person, this churl, the enormity of whose villainy and covetousness exceeds even the liveliest description, would fain be thought to be liberal, bountiful, manly, honorable. He seems not to see any reason in his "depart in peace, by ye warmed and filled"—not being accepted in lieu of "those things which are needful to the body." And should any have the confidence, from the churl's 'making empty the soul of the hungry, and his causing the drink of the thirsty to fail,' to scruple the goodness or the nobleness of his heart, it will be much if he is not deemed uncharitable and severe. Hence hy∣pocritical and lying professions of a good disposition, of good intentions, of full resolutions,—to do some∣thing clever, something honorable and noble, are always to supply the gaping vacancy of something clever, honorable and noble. And after all his study and care to save appearances, while he rebels against righteousness, and against his duty; his speaking villainy, his heart's working iniquity, his practising hypocrisy, his uttering error against the
<PB N="50" REF="017823_0048_0FA319B803D94A60"/>
Lord, his making empty the soul of the hungry, his causing the drink of the thirsty to fail, his evil in∣struments, his wicked devices, his destroying the poor with lying words, will all appear without a covering and without excuse, and procure him the heavy curses due to his little soul. He shall no longer then be ranked amongst good and honourable men—he shall be called, and treated as, a vile churl.</P>
<P>"But the liberal deviseth liberal things."—This man can look on great and generous designs with noble pleasure and a heart-felt satisfaction; and in this, as well as in every other respect, he is superior to a man of a narrow mind, in that he can behold the solicitor of a charity, without turning pale. It is not his character to treat the good of others with cold indifference; for he knows by experience that "it is more blessed to give than to receive." And as he enjoys the pleasure of diffusing happiness amongst men, so he is "satisfied from himself." With him it is not sufficient barely to be just—he delights in being bountiful. And since he hath this promptitude, it is no marvel that he prefers the pub∣lic to any private interest. His "charity seeketh not her own." The amassing of wealth, and laying up riches, he knows not whether for a wise man or a fool, is not an object of so much importance in his estimation, as his being "eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame; a father to the poor, and a searcher out of the cause that he knows not, his breaking the jaws of the wicked, and plucking the spoil out of his teeth." The cry of the poor, of the fatherless, and of him who hath none to keep him, more readily reacheth his feelings, than the moving eloquence of the ablest orator; and the widow's heart singing for joy affords him a nobler entertainment, than even a band of the best performers. And so odd is he in
<PB N="51" REF="017823_0049_0FA319B8C5B0C1B0"/>
his notion, that he really prefers "the blessing of him who was ready to perish," to all the praises of cringing sycophants, and the loud huzzas of lazy dependents, or even the degrading encomium—He is a very rich man.</P>
<P>To recommend this excellence of temper yet more to your acceptance, I beg leave only to add, that it will help you to pass by affronts and to pardon abuses. You may have much need of this, in the midst of such a provoking generation as this, who think it becoming men of spirit readily to resent, at least with the sword of the tongue, every usage of their neighbours, that is so unfortunate as not to agree with their nice sentiments of dignity and honor. It is the glory of a great mind to pass unnoticed such abuse; "not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrary wise blessing; knowing that he is thereunto called, that he should inherit a blessing.'</P>
<P>Should this divine greatness, therefore, swell and enoble all your breasts, and prompt and regulate all your views, give me leave to assure you, my friends, that it will make you the ornament of religion, the pillars of society, and the beast and glory of good men. This will acquire you a name that is better than precious ointment; and the fruits of it will be "an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God."</P>
<P>"And by liberal things shall he stand." 'For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men." Although these liberal things are not the meritorious ground of our stand∣ing in the divine favour, yet they shall be produced as the necessary vouchers of our righteousness, when we shall be judged according to our works. "Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom
<PB N="52" REF="017823_0050_0FA319B9862DBDC8"/>
prepared for you from the foundation of the world: for I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: naked, and ye cloathed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</P>
<P>Be not afraid, then, my friends, to be truly libe∣ral, and truly great. So far are you from losing your money by lending it unto the Lord, that you lose even all that you do not lend to him. In this dispo∣sing of your interest you lay up for yourselves trea∣sures in heaven, which you shall enjoy hereafter. "He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord; and that which he hath given will he pay him again." "There is that scattereth, and yet increateth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty. The liberal soul shall be made fat; and he that watereth shall be wa∣tered also himself."</P>
<P N="7">7. Reprove and avoid a levelling disposition.</P>
<P>If you receive my advice under the last head, sure∣ly you will under this. Your religious character, and your highest interest depend upon it. As a le∣velling disposition is not only dangerous to society, but is expressly forbidden in God's word, I beseech you not to speak lightly of it: for in this matter you have a mighty concern with your maker. The divine law, on this subject is—"In lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves." "Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honor prefering one another." "Render to all their dues: fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour" "Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them."</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="017823_0051_0FA319BA43D03628"/>
This law you need to have well written in your hearts, that you may display it in all your deport∣ment towards others. Christians in nothing appear more like the great Pattern of humility, of meekness and of philanthropy, than they do in a strict confor∣mity to this rule And I am free to say, that it is owing to nothing but pride and arrogancy that any are not in subjection to it.</P>
<P>As a levelling spirit ever envies the superiority of its neighbours; so it does not scruple to adopt any measures to clip the wings of those who fly, or to depress those who attempt to rise. This demon of envy can never endure its equal, much less its rival, in either interest or fame. And indeed, such is the nature of this disposition, that it cannot rest without degrading other characters below the level, that it may enjoy the pleasure of thinking itself es∣teemed above them. Its language is—I am not in∣ferior to any one—men were made to serve me! Hence it confounds the distinctions which nature has made, and which time immemorial has sanctified, between members of society, on the account either of their age or rank. Men of this stamp "despise government, presumptuous are they, self willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of DIGNITIES."</P>
<P>And this evil disposition is as destructive to society, as it is ungracious and degrading. For as it dis∣robes public characters of that dignity and honour which God has confered upon them for the good of others; so it renders useless their administrations, whether it be in church or state, exactly in propor∣tion as they are brought down from that eminence in which their offices place them above others. Would you then, my friends, desire to have the ci∣vil magistrate "a terror to evil doers, and a praise to such as do well," hold him up in the light of

DIGNITY. And would you wish to have the mi∣nisters of the gospel "save them who hear them," hold them up in the light of DIGNITY. And since this daring, levelling spirit of the times has pervaded all our land, and shakes even the pillars of church and state, from both extremities of the con∣tinent, and more than legions of veterans is threat∣ening ruin to our liberties and to our religion—let me conjure you to awake, and to be upon your guard against this fiend, this offspring of pride, this enemy of all righteouness, this pest and plague of society. Now is the time for you to rouse, when the effects of a levelling spirit have become so alarming. Lift up then a standard against this enemy, and make the tyrant flee—make the tyrant die! Crush, with spi∣rit, the first risings of his power, before he gains strength amongst you—You can more easily con∣quer him in the cradle, than in the field—"I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say."</P>
<P>Finally, as family-religion—family-government—the education of children—and the promoting of learning in this young and rising state—are subjects of high importance to you, I would gladly discant upon each of them, were it not that it will swell this address to too great a size. Nevertheless, allow me to indulge in the pleasure of the hope that my pain∣ful instructions on these topics will be kept in lasting remembrance, and will be carried forth in practice, by you.</P>
<P>And now, I must take my leave of you—it may be that with some it will be for ever. I hope you will allow me to remind you, that the opportunities which we have had together, in the course of my mi∣nistry here, will sensibly affect us hereafter. The great doctrines of grace which I have invariably preached to you are of the first excellence and im∣portance.

And accordingly as these doctrines have been receieved or rejected, so will the happiness or the misery of the hearers be. Be advised then to take heed to what you have heard and learned, and hold fast. Be careful to make these doctrines shine in all your conversation, that you may shine hereafter in the kingdom of your Father.</P>
<P>"Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you. If there be therefore any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the spirit, if any bowels and mercies, fulfill ye my joy, that ye be like-minded, having the same love, being of one ac∣cord, of one mind." My address concludes with the blessing of Israel:</P>
<P>"The Lord bless thee, and keep thee: the Lord make his face to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace."</P>
