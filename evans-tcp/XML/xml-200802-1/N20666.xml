<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>PSALM LXXXVII.2.</BIBL>
<P>THE LORD LOVETH THE GATES OF ZION, MORE THAN ALL THE DWELLINGS OF JACOB.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE heaven of heavens cannot contain the Almighty: Yet he condescendeth to dwell with man on earth, with him that is of a humble and contrite spirit: He look∣eth down from the habitation of his holiness, with grace and goodness, on every humble supplicant of his mercy: He acknowledges a temple, in every heart, that truly worships him: He hears the most secret prayer of retire∣ment: And accepts, as a pleasing sacrifice, even the hidden devotion of the inmost soul.</P>
<P>Real piety, however, is not confined to the bosom where it resides. And though, in the view of him who desireth truth in the inward part, that service only is ac∣ceptable, that is offered with a disposition which can be discerned by none but God; yet genuine religion will not conceal itself from the public eye. Like the lamp that giveth light to every part of the house, it will shine in all our deportment; and be visible through every part of our character, as men, and as creatures of the living God.</P>
<P>From a general conviction of this truth, probably hath arisen the general consent of mankind, to the obligations of public and social worship.</P>
<P>However this may be, we find it to have been the prac∣tice of all nations, from the earliest periods, to cultivate some public institutions of religion▪ in which, in a social manner, they presented the sacrifices of devotion to the Deity.</P>
<P>It is our privilege, who enjoy the light of revelation. to know, that what men have generally esteemed the first
<PB N="4" REF="027135_0003_0FD495620A5A2198"/>
duty of society, is a duty of the first importance, and most highly acceptable in the eye of God himself: As it is expressed in our text, "The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob."</P>
<P>It is not necessary to enter on a critical examination of this Psalm, in order to throw light upon these words. The reason of so honorable a preference given to Zion, was that there was the seat of the temple. There, in a peculiar manner, dwelt the divine presence. Thence it pleased God to deliver the divine oracles, and to send forth his prophets. And there was the place, appointed for the assembling of all Israel, to present their united offerings to the Lord.</P>
<P>The christian dispensation, it is true, enlarges and ex∣tends our privilege. God is not now confined to temples made with hands: And neither the mountain of Samaria, nor yet Jerusalem, is entitled to the peculiar honor of his sacred presence. The promised hour is come, when the true worshippers worship the Father in spirit and in truth. In every place where men call upon the Lord, where two or three are gathered together in the name of Christ, he is there in the midst of them. We immediately perceive, however, on contemplating these circumstances, how friendly an aspect they have towards the public worship of christian societies: And we naturally infer from them, that if it pleased God to honor with the peculiar tokens of his favor, the costly rites and laborious forms of the Mosaic institutions, much more will he accept the simple and unadorned, but spiritual worship of the gospel. In this view how animating and encouraging is such a declaration as this in the text, to every undertaking for the promotion of public worship in the gospel church: "The Lord loveth the gates of Zion, more than all the dwellings of Jacob." The import of this is, that God is pleased indeed with the sacrifice of an humble mind, with the secret worship of the heart▪ and with the retired offerings of the individual; but will more especially bless and honor the public assem∣blies of his saints.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="027135_0004_0FD49565D2F4C498"/>It is my intention in considering this subject, a little more particularly to point out to you the benefits of public wor∣ship, and then to direct to some suitable application of the discourse. And,</P>
<P N="1">1st. It is an important benefit of public worship, that it promotes the improvement of human nature, in the most useful and valuable attainments; inspires and cultivates those dispositions and habits, which enable men to act their part with propriety, in the present world, and fits and prepares them for future happiness.</P>
<P>It is obvious that the christian worship, of which we are now speaking, is calculated to enlarge the sphere of the human understanding, presents to its consideration many new objects of infinite importance to the happiness of mankind, and if duly attended to, must accelerate the advancement of the rational powers towards their highest state of perfection. Those pure and exalted conceptions which the gospel worship inspires of the great God, as the creator of the universe, the kind and gracious parent of his intelligent creatures, the righteous governor of the world, who disposeth all things, relating to men, for the promotion of the virtue, the wisdom, and the happiness of mankind: Those glorious and sublime ideas, under which the divine perfections are presented to us, as the objects of our adoration: That humbling impression of our own condition, which is enforced on our hearts, as in a state of apostacy and revolt from God; and that illustrious display of mercy towards fallen man, in the redemption, by which alone we can draw nigh to our Maker in hope: Must at once enkindle the devout affections, inspire with the love of virtue, and arm the soul with fortitude in the pursuit of divine attainments.</P>
<P>At the same time the frequent recollection of these great ideas, especially with a view to the devout expression of our reverence and regard to God, cannot but raise the mind to a degree of elevation, far above what it is capa∣ble of by any other means.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="027135_0005_0FD4956745332188"/>Doth the knowledge of human sciences improve the understanding? Is the soul enlarged by an acquaintance with the works of nature, with history and philosophy? How inferior are the highest attainments in these, to those just apprehensions of the divine perfections, and of the mystery of salvation which we are taught in our holy re∣ligion! Even in this view, the christian worship presents us with a source of knowledge, the most improving and sublime. But while, by these means, it sets before our eyes the perfections, the government, and the grace of God, in a light the most amiable and captivating, in a light the most encouraging to every truly pious and devout mind: There is a grandeur and solemnity in the principles of the gospel worship, which must at once awaken in the heart, a respect for the divine administration and a dispo∣sition suitable to our condition as lapsed, but redeemed creatures.</P>
<P>What an awful and affecting circumstance is it, for in∣stance, when a whole assembly prostrate their souls at the foot-stool of sovereign mercy: Where none presumes to claim acceptance, but on the principles of repentance and faith in the atonement of the redeemer! What an idea doth it give us of the sanctity of the divine laws, of the strictness of his justice, and of the wonders of his love, when we contemplate that astonishing method of salvation which is frequently presented to our consideration, and ought always to be kept in recollection in our solemn approaches to the Deity. How strongly are the obliga∣tions of piety and virtue enforced by the consideration of the respect which these solemn transactions have to futurity. While in public worship we stand, as it were, on the con∣fines of both worlds, an unbounded prospect opens upon us into eternity, and marks, with peculiar emphasis, the importance of our station and character here on earth. We are led to consider ourselves as probationers for a future state of existence, in which we are to be fixed in everlasting abodes of happiness or punishment, agreeably
<PB N="7" REF="027135_0006_0FD49568BB0632F0"/>
to our improvement or neglect of the advantages and duties of the present state.</P>
<P>Who that familiarises these sentiments to his soul, by a regular attendance on the duties of social worship, will not experience some happy influence of them on his heart! At least, as far as religious principles can, in the nature of things, be effectual, he must be rendered by them a wiser and better man.</P>
<P>In proportion to the sincerity of his belief of them, they must not only humble him in the dust, as a sinner who hath forfeited the favor of heaven; and impress upon his heart a thankful sense of his obligations to redeeming grace: But dispose him, in all things, to maintain a con∣science void of offence both towards God and towards man.</P>
<P>I shall only add, under this head, that a stated atten∣dance on the ordinances of public worship hath a ten∣dency to fit and prepare the soul for future happiness.</P>
<P>As it improves and enlarges the understanding, as it inspires with sentiments of devotion, as under the divine blessing, it is highly instrumental in purifying the heart, and promoting the habits of godliness and virtue; it assi∣milates the mind to that blest society, who have already arrived at a state of perfection. But as it consists in itself, of a series of devout employments, it may be considered, in some sense, as heaven already enjoyed on earth. The same gratitude and love, that animate the songs and in∣flame the hearts of the redeemed in glory; the same unity of spirit that binds them in everlasting bonds of angelic affection, are already in some measure in exercise, in every pure gospel church on earth; and by means most proper for the purpose, are in the way of improvement towards perfection.</P>
<P>While, therefore, we unite in the devout employments of gospel worship, we are in the practice of those habits which constitute the employments of the heavenly state; of those habits which tend to imprint upon our soul a sense
<PB N="8" REF="027135_0007_0FD4956C822CB3A0"/>
of our obligations to every moral virtue; of those habits which refine and purify the heart, and fit and prepare us for eternity.</P>
<P N="2">2d. It is an interesting advantage of public <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>ip, that it prepares the mind for those trials to which human nature is unavoidably exposed; and furnishes it with ar∣mour against the ills and distresses of life.</P>
<P>It would be easy to expatiate on the forlorn and helpless state of a man, without the benefits and consolations of religion. He finds himself, by the very constitution of his nature, in many respects, a child of sorrow. Through all the various stages of his being, his way is marked with unexpected vicissitudes. The blandishments of childhood and youth are succeeded by the woes of riper years. The prosperity of the morning is eclipsed by the afflictions which suddenly arise to darken his horizon; and the sha∣dows of the evening descend upon him thickened with the gloom of melancholy disappointment. Untaught in reli∣gious truths, he perceives nothing in the ways of providence but mysterious darkness. He is lost in a labyrinth of in∣explicable events. He knows not what to look for from present appearances; whether he may hope in the divine protection on the tempestuous sea of life; or what is to be the final issue of those perplexing circumstances with which he is surrounded.</P>
<P>In this situation, what a source of light, of comfort and support are the ordinances of religion? In the gospel we are instructed in those ways of providence, which philo∣sophy and reason have attempted to investigate in vain. We here learn, that the occasion of those calamities which happen alike to the good and the wicked, is the universal guilt of human nature: That in the midst of the days of our vanity, however, God is the father and the friend of them that fear him: That he conducts the dispensations of his providence with an eternal regard to order, truth and virtue: That, however complex our present situation may appear, he hath ordained an happy issue to every event, in
<PB N="9" REF="027135_0008_0FD49570C6F7B100"/>
which the children of his mercy are concerned: That he hath opened a way for the deliverance of his fallen crea∣tures, from all the inconveniencies which they are liable to on account of sin, by Jesus Christ his beloved son: And hath secured to them that return to him and accept his grace, a present benefit in all their sorrows, and in future, a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</P>
<P>It would be a pleasure to reflect on these truths—It would at least, inspire the suffering mind with hope, were it only probable he might become a partaker in such bles∣sings. But how much more cheering is it, in a distressed hour, to know that God himself, hath appointed the means by which these blessings flow to every creature, who seeks them according to his gospel: That for this end he hath "given some apostles, and some prophets, and some evan∣gelists, and some pastors and, teachers, for the perfecting the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying the body of Christ."</P>
<P>How supporting, how encouraging is it in the most try∣ing seasons of adversity, to be permitted to approach to the Almighty in those sealing ordinances, in which he ratifies the promises of his grace; in which he admits the claim of the children of his covenant on his favor and protec∣tion: in which he renews and confirms the declarations of his grace and kindness towards them that hope in his salvation, and are obedient to his word.</P>
<P>Do we derive support from religion in the silent hours of retirement? How much more may we expect it in the use and enjoyment of those pledges of unchanging goodness, to which we are invited, in the assemblies of his saints! <HI>That</HI> furnishes a recollection of the grounds of peace and tran∣quility, and of a better hope, and more substantial enjoy∣ments hereafter: But <HI>these</HI> are the evidences, that enstamp with a sacred authority all the promises of God, become a visible security, on the part of heaven for the accomplishment of his word, and add strong consolation to the confidence of these, who have fled for refuge, to the hope of the gospel.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="027135_0009_0FD48ECAA8BD5DF8"/>In the</P>
<P N="3">3d Place; it is a high advantage of public worship, that it is one of the best means of promoting and strengthen∣ing the benevolent and social affections in the human heart.</P>
<P>There is no situation in which men can possibly appear in so endearing a point of light to one another, as when they are assembled in one society, to adore the God and Father of the universe. No circumstance so effectually calls every generous affection into exercise, as when they offer their united praises, join in one common supplication before the mercy seat of heaven; and express their earnest hope and expectation of living together forever in the enjoyment of undivided blessings in the kingdom of God.</P>
<P>Here all distinctions die. All animosities and contentions cease. In the presence of God we stand all on one com∣mon level. As sinners we are naturally alike; in the same state of condemnation, entitled to the same hopes, liable to the same fears, with an equal interest in the benefits of pardoning mercy, and equally concerned in the worthy performance of the duties we are employed in.</P>
<P>How much is it to the interest of mankind, that those seasons, which habituate them to consider one another in so pleasing a point of view, return as frequently as possible! These are the most effectual means of softening and human∣izing the heart; and of promoting those noble and gene∣rous dispositions, which are the highest ornament of human nature.</P>
<P>It may be thought, that moral virtue may subsist equally well independent of religion. Articles of religious belief it may perhaps be said, are mere points of speculation, which have little influence on the morals of mankind. But the observances we are pleading for, have an indispu∣table effect on the sentiments of the heart; and in propor∣tion, must have a sensible influence on the life and manners of the sincerely conscientious. In them, at least, they must promote a generous philanthropy; and will become a strong security for their performance of all the duties
<PB N="11" REF="027135_0010_0FD49576773DC4F8"/>
which they owe to society. Nay, even the inconsiderate and unthinking, who have not experienced the sublime influence of religion in so effectual a manner, may never∣theless be restrained by them in their career, and become better members of the community.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This appears to me to be a most important consideration, in a young country, rising by a swift progress to opulence and power. As a nation advances in these, the sources of luxury and pleasure are multiplied, and generally produce a corruption and licentiousness of morals: And this by a natural consequence leads the way to disorder and destruction No sufficient guard has ever yet been devised by human wisdom against this fatal process. In many respects it does not lie within the reach of social regulations; but a sense of God and religion naturally restrains the excesses which grow out of a state of prosperity, and teaches men to correct in themselves, many of those levities, which, however pernicious their tendency in society, cannot be suppressed by its laws. The reader is referred on this subject, to an Essay on the influence of Religion in Civil Society, by the Rev. Thomas R<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se.</NOTE> While many it is to be expected, may be recovered from sin and folly, and reinstated in the favor of heaven.</P>
<P>For the application of this subject:</P>
<P>What hath been said on the advantages of public worship, may be considered as an argument of our obligation to encourage and promote it.</P>
<P>You have well done, my brethren, who have entered on this useful, necessary and interesting undertaking in this place. The success, which hath thus far followed your endeavours, and enabled you to repair a building for the worship of God, which hath so long lain useless and in ruins, is a pleasing intimation of the favor of Providence on the design. What hath already been effected, ought to evince to you, with what facility you may accomplish any pious and useful undertaking, when you act in concert and with a willing mind. With equal ease, I doubt not, you will be able to proceed in the fulfillment of your plan, in establishing amongst you, the ministry of the word of God. Considerable and persevering exertions may still be requisite for that purpose.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="027135_0011_0FD49577C5911068"/>Permit me, however, to remind you, that the object you have in view is well worthy of all your attention. When obtained, it will bring with it a reward, which will be of growing value to them that enjoy it, through all the changing scenes of this mortal state, and which will shine with inextinguishable lustre in the world to come.</P>
<P>In this building you have opened a fountain from which, with the blessing of God, will flow some of the most invaluable benefits to yourselves, to your children, and to society. The word of truth, dispensed from this place, like a river that enriches the soil, while it beautifies and adorns the country through which it passes, will diffuse those streams of religious knowledge which shall improve the heart and better the understanding, and add the beauty of virtue to the life of many. No design could be better calculated to promote individual or social happiness; for, while Christianity forms a man for the enjoyment of him∣self, while it furnishes his mind with useful and interesting sentiments, while it refines his soul, administers comfort to him in adversity, and heightens his enjoyment in pros∣perity; while thus it multiplies and enlarges his means of personal satisfaction, it renders him a more useful mem∣ber of the community. The example of a good man is a public benefit; religion sheds a lustre on his conduct which makes it venerable; his virtues command the re∣spect, and recommend themselves to the imitation of all around him; his presence chases away vice and folly; and his conversation, generally, is promotive of sound and useful knowledge.</P>
<P>In all the social characters men are improved by reli∣gion. The magistrate and the private citizen, the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ther, the husband, the brother, the friend, the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>, and even the servant, is enabled to act his part with more propriety, and to fulfil the duties of his situation with integrity, in proportion as he is under the influence and direction of the doctrines of Christianity. Religion is the first bond of the social compact, the only tie of union among
<PB N="13" REF="027135_0012_0FD4957950696E68"/>
mankind, which can preserve that harmony, good order, and decorum, which are essential to the common good. We find that this formed the basis of those systems of policy by which men have, from the earliest ages, been reduced to a state of society; and if religion, darkened with ignorance and error, and burdened with superstition, was so precious an instrument in the hands of the wisest legislators and sovereigns, how much more may be ex∣pected from it when illustrated and explained in the purity and under the authority of the gospel?</P>
<P>After all the parade that hath been made of philosophy, of the light of reason, and of natural virtue, it is to the influence of Christianity that we are indebted for the great∣est part of the refinement and purity of morals that is to be found amongst men at this day. As Christianity hath spread her light around, learning and the liberal arts have been more cultivated and improved; men have acquired a better knowledge of the general rights of human nature, have framed wise and liberal systems of civil government, and are advancing towards that state of light and purity when they shall no more hurt nor destroy, and the
<Q>earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.</Q>
But, above all, by the light of Christianity many are conducted in the paths of truth and virtue, are instructed in the knowledge of eternal life, and prepared for the everlasting blessings and felici∣ties of the kingdom of Heaven.</P>
<P>Such are the benefits you are obtaining, such the ad∣vantages which, by divine goodness, you are enabled to promote in society; and you have the greater reason to expect to succeed in it, when you recollect that it is a de∣sign on which the divine approbation is pronounced, in such expressions as those in the text—
<Q>The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.</Q>
Private methods of instruction and improvement may ob∣tain his blessing, and be attended with advantage; but it is to public worship, and to the social use of divine or∣dinances,
<PB N="14" REF="027135_0013_0FD4957B229D7B10"/>
that his favour is peculiarly promised. This auspicious day places you, in that respect, in a situation the most eligible and promising. Many motives arise from this consideration, to induce your stedfastness and perseverance in promoting the cause which you have so seasonably and so judiciously undertaken.</P>
<P>By these means you will contribute towards the ad∣vancement of the best interests of society. You will pro∣vide for the dissemination of religious and useful know∣ledge; you may probably have the satisfaction of reclaim∣ing many from the error of their ways; the benefit of your pious care will descend to the latest posterity; and the blessing of millions, that were ready to perish, will come upon you.</P>
<P>Go on, therefore, with the resolution and unanimity with which you have begun; endeavour to strengthen amongst you the bonds of peace, and to be yourselves living examples of that virtue, benevolence and justice, which are the ornaments of human nature, and which it is the design of all religious institutions to promote. Above all, endeavour to obtain those saving benefits by the gospel, which, as they will add a lustre to your cha∣racter, and render you a blessing to mankind, will also fit and prepare you for future happiness. Use your ad∣vantages with a view to the renovation of your nature, and for your improvement in all holy and godlike attain∣ments; that while, in the gospel, you behold the glory of the Lord, as in a glass, you may be changed into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the spirit of the Lord; and may the God of all grace shine upon you and bless you. In a peculiar manner may he own and prosper this pious work, and cause
<Q>the sun of righteous∣ness to arise upon it with blessings in his rays! Then shall your light go forth as the morning, and your judgment as the noon day.</Q>
AMEN.</P>
