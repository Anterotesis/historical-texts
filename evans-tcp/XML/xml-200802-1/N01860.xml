<HEAD>Some Account of Inoculating or Transplanting the Small Pox; And of the Benefit and Safety of the Practice.</HEAD>
<P>THE Publick having been lately enter∣tained with a very dark and partial Account of this <HI>New Method</HI> of receiving the <HI>Small Pox;</HI> and this Account being given as is pretended, from the very Letters of Dr. <HI>Timonius</HI> and <HI>Pylarinus;</HI> it is thought rea∣sonable and fitting to lay before the Publick this following <HI>Abstract</HI> of what those <HI>Learned Gentlemen</HI> have said of this Practice. But because the <HI>Gentleman</HI> who only hath these Letters by him, refuses now to lend them; the Account here following is chiefly taken from a known <HI>Letter</HI> written by a Learned Gentleman of <HI>Boston</HI> to the Worthy Physicians of the Town.</P>

<HEAD>A Faithful Abridg∣ment of Two Ac∣counts in the Philoso∣phical Transactions.</HEAD>
<P>I. OUR first Communication comes from Dr. <HI>Emanuel Timonius,</HI> a Renowned Fellow of the <HI>Royal Society</HI> at <HI>London,</HI> (well known to some in <HI>Boston,</HI> who also actually knew the Truth of the matter of Fact now going to be related,) who writes from <HI>Constantinople</HI> in <HI>December</HI> 1713. And he informs to this Effect; The practice of procuring the <HI>Small Pox</HI> by a sort of <HI>Inoculation,</HI> has been introduced among the <HI>Constantinopolitans</HI> by the <HI>Circassians,</HI> and <HI>Georgians,</HI> and other <HI>Asiaticks</HI> for about Forty Years. At the first the People were cautious and afraid; but the <HI>Happy Success</HI> on <HI>Thou∣sands</HI> of Persons for Eight Years now past has <HI>put it out of all suspicion.</HI> The Operation
<PB N="2" REF="002206_0004_0FDACBFB9830EAB8"/>
has been performed on Persons of all Ages, both Sexes, differing Temperaments, &amp; even in the worst Constitution of the Air; and <HI>none that have used it ever died of the Small Pox,</HI> tho' at the same time, it were so malignant, that at least <HI>half the People died,</HI> that were infected with it in the Common way.</P>
<P>They that have this <HI>Inoculation</HI> practised on them (he says) are subject unto very <HI>Slight Symp∣toms,</HI> and hardly sensible of any Sickness, nor do what <HI>Small Pox</HI> they have, ever leave any Scars or Pits behind them.</P>
<P>They make choice of as Healthy a Young Person as they can find, that has the <HI>Small Pox</HI> of the best sort upon him, on the Twelfth or Thirteenth Day of his Decumbiture. With a Needle they prick some of the larger <HI>Pustules,</HI> and press out the Matter coming from them into some convenient Vessel of Glass (or the like) to receive it, which ought first of all to be washed very clean with warm Water. A convenient quantity of this Mat∣ter being thus collected, is to be stop'd close, and kept warm in the bosom of the Person that carries it (who ought rather to be some <HI>other Person,</HI> than what visited the Sick Chamber for it, lest the Infection of the <HI>Small Pox</HI> be convey'd in the <HI>Garment,</HI> as well as in the <HI>Bottle,</HI> and the intended Ope∣ration be hurt by the <HI>Infection</HI> being first con∣veyed
<PB N="3" REF="002206_0005_0FDACBFD1C5A8798"/>
another way, and so it should be con∣veyed as soon as may be to the Person that is waiting to be the Patient.</P>
<P>The Patient being in a warm Chamber, is to have several small Wounds made with a Surgeon's Three edged Needle, or with a <HI>Lancet,</HI> in two or more Places of the Skin (the best Places are in the Muscles of the <HI>Arm</HI>) till some drops of Blood follow: And Immediately let there be dropt out a drop of the Matter in the Glass, on each of the Places; and mix'd well with the Blood that is issuing out. The Wound should be covered with half a Walnut shell, or any such con∣cave Vessel, and bound over that the matter may not be rub'd off by the Garments for a few Hours; And now let the Patient (having Fillets on the Wounds,) keep House, and keep warm, and be careful of his Diet; The Custom at <HI>Constantinople</HI> is to abstain from Flesh and Broth for Twenty Days or more. They chuse to perform the Operation either in the beginning of <HI>Winter</HI> or <HI>Spring.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Small Pox</HI> begins sooner in some than others, and with lesser Symptoms in some than others; but with <HI>happy Success in all.</HI> Commonly Ten or Twenty <HI>Pustules</HI> break out; here and there One has no more than two or three; Few have a <HI>Hundred.</HI> There are some, in whom no <HI>Pustules</HI> rise, but in the
<PB N="4" REF="002206_0006_0FDAC8B992C396C0"/>
Places where the Incision was made: And here the <HI>Tubercles</HI> will be purulent: Yet even <HI>These</HI> have never had the <HI>Small Pox</HI> afterwards, tho' they have Cohabited with Persons hav∣ing of it. No small Quantity of Matter will run for several Days from the Places of the <HI>Inscision.</HI> The <HI>Pocks</HI> arising from this Opera∣tion are dried up in a short time; and fall off, partly in thin Skins, and partly vanishing by an insensible wasting.</P>
<P>The Matter is hardly so thick a <HI>Pus</HI> as in the common <HI>Small Pox,</HI> but a thinner kind of <HI>Sanies,</HI> whence it rarely Pitts, except at the Place of the Inscision, where the <HI>Cicrtrices</HI> are never worn out, and where the matter is more of the common sort.</P>
<P>If an <HI>Apostem</HI> should break out in any (which is more frequent in Infants) yet there is no fear, for 'tis heal'd safely by Suppura∣tion.</P>
<P>They scarce ever use the matter of the Inscitious Small Pox to serve the Designs of a new Inscition. The <HI>Inoculation</HI> being tryed on such as have had the <HI>Small Pox</HI> before, it had no effect at all on them. Dr. <HI>Timonius</HI> affirms, that he <HI>never yet observed any bad Consequence</HI> of the Practice, which now so many do come into.</P>

<P>II. SINCE this Communication from Dr. <HI>Timonius,</HI> there came to the ROYAL SOCIETY a further, from an Eminent Person whose Name is <HI>Jacobus Pylarinus;</HI> the <HI>Vene∣tian</HI> Consul at <HI>Smyrna;</HI> and who appears to have had no knowledge, of what had been written by the former. It is Entituled, <HI>A New and Safe Method of Exciting the Small-Pox by Transplantation.</HI></P>
<P>This Gentleman observes, That this <HI>Won∣derful Invention</HI> was first found out, not by the Learned Sons of Erudition, but by a Mean, Coarse, Rude sort of People, for the <HI>Succour of Mankind</HI> under and against one of the most <HI>Cruel Diseases</HI> in the World. It was rarely if ever used among People of Quality, until after the beginning of the present Cen∣tury. A Noble <HI>Groecian</HI> then in distress for his Four little Sons, lest the <HI>Small Pox</HI> might bereave him of them, consulted with him about using the <HI>Inoculation</HI> upon them. At first, his Ignorance of the Matter, made him decline giving any Advice upon it; But a <HI>Groecian Woman</HI> who was a notable <HI>Inocula∣trix,</HI> happening to come in, while they were discoursing of the Matter, told them so much about it, that the Experiment was resolved on. The Woman managed in her way, upon all the Four Sons. The Three Younger, all of which were under Seven Years of Age, felt
<PB N="6" REF="002206_0008_0FDACC0197BB68B0"/>
a very <HI>gentle Illness,</HI> had very <HI>few Pustules,</HI> and in about a Week all Fever and Hazard was over with them. The Eldest, about Eight Years old, was taken with a malignant Fe∣ver: and (tho' he had not many Pustules) narrowly escaped with his Life. <HI>Pylarinus</HI> imputes this, to an <HI>Atrabiliarious,</HI> and other∣wise Humourous &amp; Unhealthy Constitution of the Lad, and a neglect of using such <HI>Pre∣paratory Expiation</HI> of his Body, as they had been advised unto. But upon this <HI>Happy Success,</HI> it was wonderful to see, what a <HI>Mul∣titude of People of Fashion</HI> presently followed the Example. So that at this Day <HI>every one does</HI> without any Hesitation, and with all the security imaginable, practice the <HI>Trans∣plantation;</HI> except here and there a few Cowards that are afraid of their Shadows. Indeed, the <HI>Turks</HI> whose Faith in Fate, is as we know, and who are a more Indocible sort of Animals, <HI>do not yet</HI> much come into it.</P>
<P><HI>Pylarinus,</HI> instructed by his Greek Opera∣trix, directs to take, a <HI>Proper Season</HI> for the Inscition. She would use it only in the Win∣ter, but he thinks the <HI>Spring</HI> may do as well.</P>
<P>The Fermenting <HI>Pus</HI> must be taken from the mature Pustules of a good Sort, in a Young Person of a good Constitution, kept Warm in a close Vial, and hastened unto the Applica∣tion.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="002206_0009_0FDACC031A1C6AF0"/>
The Air of the Chamber must be kept very Temperate. The Greek <HI>Operatrix,</HI> prick't more places, and less fleshy ones than <HI>Pylari∣nus</HI> approved of; with an oblique stroke pricking the Places, with an Iron, or Golden Needle dropping, and thrusting the <HI>Pus</HI> into the Wound; and so binding all with Fillets. Her way was thus to prick the <HI>Forehead,</HI> the <HI>Chin,</HI> both <HI>Cheeks,</HI> both <HI>Wrists,</HI> both <HI>Insteps.</HI> This was doubtless overdoing. <HI>Pylarinus</HI> affirms that some have done the Business, with <HI>no more than One</HI> little Inscision in the Arm, and it has done very well. [So it has been with such <HI>Africans,</HI> as have shown us the Marks of their Inoculation.]</P>
<P>They must not keep their Beds more than is necessary. <HI>Wine, Flesh</HI> and <HI>Broth</HI> must be laid aside.</P>
<P>The Ferment comes into Action in some sooner than in others. Usually the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> (as far as it may be called so,) appears on the <HI>Seventh-Day;</HI> sometimes on the very <HI>First.</HI></P>
<P>The Symptoms prove <HI>Remiss</HI> or <HI>Intense</HI> ac∣cording to the various Constitutions of the Bo∣dies. The <HI>Small Pox</HI> proves of the <HI>Distinct Sort;</HI> and there will be but few of them; it may be Ten, or Twenty; rarely a <HI>Hundred.</HI></P>
<P>In some <HI>few</HI> the <HI>Inscision</HI> has produced no <HI>Small Pox</HI> at all; but the Persons have after∣wards
<PB N="8" REF="002206_0010_0FDACC04973CD270"/>
in the common way been taken and handled with it like other People. The Wounds made for the <HI>Inscision,</HI> prove often very sore. And with some they degenerate into <HI>Apostems.</HI> Yea, These do swell some∣times, and rise, and fall, and rise again▪ There has also happened on this Occasion an <HI>Abscess</HI> with Suppuration, in some Emunctory of the Body: But this is a very rare <HI>Occur∣rence.</HI></P>
<P>In Fin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <HI>Pylarinus</HI> affirms; It was hardly ever known, that there was any <HI>Ill Conse∣quence</HI> of this <HI>Transplantation,</HI> But the Bu∣siness being well and wisely managed, &amp; the Body being by a skilful Physician Well-pre∣pared, you may depend upon it <HI>(he says)</HI> in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n ordinary way, there can be <HI>nothing but a Good Issue of it.</HI></P>

<HEAD>REMARKS.</HEAD>
<P>I. LET it be considered, That these Com∣munications come from Great Men, and Persons of Great Erudition and Reputa∣tion, and are address'd unto very Eminent Persons. Let it be also considered, that with the Approbation of the ROYAL SOCIETY (as Illustrious a Body as are in the World) their Secretary the celebrated Dr. <HI>Halley,</HI> has publish'd these things, as worthy to come into the notice of Mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="002206_0011_0FDACC0617DCCB90"/>
II. There is at this Time a considerable Number of <HI>Africans</HI> in this Town, who can have no Conspiracy or Combination to cheat us. No body has instructed them to tell their Story. The more plainly, brokenly, and blunderingly, and like Ideots, they tell their Story, it will be with reasonable Men, but the much more credible. For <HI>that these</HI> all agree in <HI>one Story;</HI> <Q>That abundance of poor Negro's die of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> till they learn this <HI>Way;</HI> that People take the Juice of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> and <HI>Cut the Skin,</HI> and put in a drop; then by'nd by a little <HI>Sick,</HI> then few <HI>Small Pox;</HI> and no body dye of it: no body have <HI>Small Pox</HI> any more.</Q></P>
<P>Here we have a clear Evidence, that in <HI>A∣frica,</HI> where the Poor Creatures dye of the <HI>Small Pox</HI> in the common way like Rotten Sheep, a Merciful GOD has taught them a <HI>wonderful Preservative.</HI></P>
<P>It is a <HI>Common Practice,</HI> and is is attended with <HI>Success.</HI> I have as full Evidence of this, as I have that there are <HI>Lions</HI> in <HI>Africa.</HI> And I don't know why 'tis more unlaw∣ful to learn of <HI>Africans,</HI> how to help against the <HI>Poison</HI> of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> than it is to learn of our <HI>Indians,</HI> how to help against the <HI>Poison</HI> of a <HI>Rattle-Snake.</HI></P>
<P>III. Is it possible to conceive, that this Prac∣tice should continue among People <HI>Forty Years</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="002206_0012_0FDACC079A890B88"/>
together, and grow more and more into re∣pute, and at last be put out of all <HI>Suspicion,</HI> and yet that there should be any Truth in the Reports of People's <HI>dying</HI> under the <HI>Ope∣ration,</HI> or being liable to the <HI>Small Pox</HI> after it? Had Peoples Limbs perished, or had they been liable to the Small Pox after it, we may be sure, a few Examples would have put an end to the Practice <HI>Forty Years</HI> ago. Good Readers, Judge calmly, and like reasonable Men.</P>
<P>IV. The Author of these <HI>Abridgments</HI> ad∣dress'd them unto those, who had the <HI>Origi∣nals</HI> in their Hands; and therefore it cannot be thought, that it was not as <HI>Faithful a Re∣port</HI> as he could make of the matter; But it having been insinuated, that there might be a more full and perfect Relation, The Author desires it, and I desire it my self, That the Accounts given in the <HI>Philosophical Transactions</HI> be permitted by the Owner to come abroad, and be publish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>Word for Word,</HI> that <HI>impar∣tial Men</HI> may see <HI>with their own Eyes,</HI> the true state of the Case.</P>
<P>V. It might be easy for me to make Answers to the Scurrilous things lately Published a∣gainst me, and satisfy the Publick of the <HI>Falshood</HI> and <HI>Basen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss</HI> in them. But I think it rather becomes a considerate Man to de∣cline <HI>foolish Contentions;</HI> especially at a time, when there is <HI>a grievous Calamity</HI> upon us,
<PB N="11" REF="002206_0013_0FDACC0965E825B8"/>
that calls us (instead of railing at one ano∣ther) to Unite in Prayers to Almighty GOD, for His Mercies to us. And therefore if any think to go on with their <HI>Calumnies &amp; Foole∣ries,</HI> I shall not think fit to take any Notice of them. What I do (I hope as it has hi∣therto done) will <HI>vindicate it self</HI> with Peo∣ple of Thought and Probity.</P>
<P>VI. I have made my <HI>Experiments</HI> with all the <HI>Disadvantages</HI> that can be imagined, on <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>Young,</HI> on <HI>Strong</HI> and <HI>Weak,</HI> on <HI>Male</HI> and <HI>Female,</HI> on <HI>White</HI> and <HI>Black,</HI> and in the <HI>worst Season</HI> of the Year; and on <HI>greater Numbers,</HI> than I judge proper (considering the unaccountable Rage of unadvised People) to mention; But more than <HI>twice Seven,</HI> I can assure you; and it has succeeded well in all, even beyond Expectation.</P>
<P>VII. We are yet but <HI>Learners;</HI> and hope through Experience to grow more expert in our Practice. In <HI>some</HI> of my <HI>Experiments</HI> hitherto, I have found the <HI>Fever</HI> somewhat more <HI>intense</HI> for a few Hours before the <HI>E∣ruption,</HI> and the Number of the <HI>Pustles</HI> to be somewhat more than usual in the <HI>Levant.</HI> Whether this be from the <HI>Season of the Year,</HI> or our <HI>Different Climate,</HI> or our <HI>high way of Living,</HI> or our want of more <HI>Experience</HI> I cannot say, till I see further. But Experi∣ence declares things to fall out <HI>for the main,</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="002206_0014_0FDACC0A9743CF80"/>
just as the Renowned TIMONIUS and PYLARINUS have related. And I have hitherto by the Blessing of GOD been able with ease to manage what <HI>Fever</HI> my Patients have had, and have never done any thing, but what every body knows is done in other common Fevers. Upon the first <HI>Eruption</HI> this <HI>Fever</HI> abates and goes off, the Patients grow so easy, that one has much ado to keep them in the condition of Patients. They have not the least Touch of that <HI>Second Fever,</HI> which People generally dye of in the com∣mon way. The <HI>Pustules</HI> are <HI>very few</HI> in some; in others, they are two or three <HI>Hundred,</HI> but at the worst, nothing to what is usual in the ordinary way of Infection. They quickly dry away. The Patients are abroad again, sooner than they who are infected in the common way; and they are on all ac∣counts as well as they were before.</P>
<P>The Sores of the Incision digest and heal as well as any other common Sores do, and if they should grow angry or trouble∣some, a very little Skill and Medicine will serve to cure them. From all I have hither∣to seen, there can be no more ill consequence of them, than from a sore Finger neglected.</P>
<P>We are informed that there is now and then, but very rarely, a little Abscess in some Emunctory of the Body: but we have met with no such thing in our Practice, and we
<PB N="13" REF="002206_0015_0FDACC0C16566240"/>
think when such did, or may happen, that it was, or may be from neglect or want of Skill in the Practitioner: nor have our Patients hitherto had the Boils or other Swellings which are common in the ordinary Small Pox, so much less is the Blood and other Jui∣ces corrupt in this, than the ordinary way. Now to form a Cry of the <HI>Plague</HI> on this occasion, as if the Practi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e would bring the <HI>Plague:</HI> This is so excessively ridiculous, that it is a wonder any People can think, much less, talk <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o. Are there not a Thousand People in Town and Country, that have had such Swellings and Sores as <HI>Timonius</HI> and <HI>Pylarinus</HI> mention, that come from Colds, ill Habits of Body, or other causes as well as from the <HI>Plague?</HI> And was it ever known that the <HI>Plague</HI> was produc'd in this way of Practice? They that have hitherto been under the Operation among us, agree in de∣claring, that they have suffered in a manner <HI>nothing;</HI> and that they would rather under∣go it <HI>several times,</HI> tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so much as once undergo the <HI>Small Pox</HI> is 'tis generally suf∣fered in the common way <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> they should be sure of surviving it. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> them (who are very <HI>religious People</HI>) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> publish'd to the World, their Thanks to Almighty GOD for shewing them th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> escape Death and Misery. Indeed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any thing
<PB N="14" REF="002206_0016_0FDACC0DA4EC7808"/>
that yet appears, here is a Discovery, that is a great <HI>Blessing</HI> to <HI>Mankind,</HI> and should be thankfully receiv'd: A way to defend our selves against a dreadful and a deadly Dis∣ease, by <HI>over ruling the way</HI> of it's coming at us, when we see 'tis coming. Many <HI>Lives</HI> might be saved, some <HI>Time</HI> also, and some <HI>Charge,</HI> (which <HI>some it may be, consider</HI>) and the Health of the Town much sooner restored; if the Practitioners and the People in the Town would come more into this Practice.</P>
<P>The other <HI>Clamours</HI> and <HI>Bugbears</HI> having been conquered, all that now remains is this: The <HI>People</HI> will <HI>have the Small Pox again.</HI> The only Answer that need be given is this; we have never yet <HI>credibly heard any Instance</HI> thereof. And those, who have passed under the <HI>Inoculation</HI> or <HI>Transplantation,</HI> are every Day visiting, and attending the Sick; with all the assurance and safety that can be. Some will confidently affirm, that to their Knowledge a Man may have the <HI>Small Pox a Second Time</HI> in the common way. And yet this hinders not the Encouragement of them who have had it once to be no more afraid of catching it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Case of Conscience</HI> distresses many wor∣thy Good People. The Case in short we take to be this. <Q>Almighty GOD in His great Mercy to Mankind, has taught us a <HI>Remedy,</HI> to be used when the dangers of the <HI>Small
<PB N="15" REF="002206_0017_0FDACC0F16903AD8"/>
Pox</HI> distress us; upon the use of which <HI>Medicine,</HI> they shall in an ordinary way be sure not to have it so severely as in the other way, and consequently not to be in such danger from this dreadful Distemper, and also to be delivered from the terrible <HI>Cir∣cumstances</HI> which many of them who reco∣ver of the Distemper do suffer for it.</Q></P>
<P>Whether a Christian may not employ this <HI>Medicine</HI> (let the matter of it be what it will) and humbly give Thanks to God for His <HI>good Providence</HI> in discovering of it to a miserable World; and humbly look up to His Good Pro∣vidence (as wedoin the use of any other Medi∣cine) for the success of it? It may seem strange, that any wise Christian cannot answer it.</P>
<P>And how strangely do Men that call them∣selves <HI>Physicians</HI> betray their <HI>Anatomy,</HI> and their <HI>Philosophy,</HI> as well as their <HI>Divinity</HI> in their invectives against this Practice? For in the First place, they make a mighty bustle about <HI>Malignant filth</HI> infus'd into the Mass of Blood, &amp;c. as if there were no Difference between injecting a quantity of some poiso∣nous Matter in some large <HI>Blood Vessel,</HI> and that of applying a <HI>Drop</HI> outwardly to the <HI>Scarified Skin,</HI> which when we consider ap∣pears to be only a drop of that which our Skins are fill'd with when we are full of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> and a considerable part of which
<PB N="16" REF="002206_0018_0FDACC1096BC34A8"/>
is return'd into the Blood again, and yet the Sick does very well. And further, when this Drop is apply'd to a Person who has had the <HI>Small Pox</HI> before, and altho' it enters, and is receiv'd by Nature in such, as well as others, as I have experienc'd, yet nature is able to cast it off without the Physicians help; and that agrees with what our Author <HI>Timo∣nius</HI> tells us; that when it has been try'd on such as have had it before, it has had no effect. Secondly, And as to their <HI>Philosophy,</HI> that the People <HI>will have it again,</HI> this is a wonder to me; when I see the Fever produc'd as is necessary to seperate and cast out the <HI>Pocky matter,</HI> and that they have a fair <HI>Pock</HI> or <HI>Pustule,</HI> and this capable of Infecting and producing the <HI>Small Pox</HI> in the ordinary way on others, and to the same Degree, this renders it with me beyond all doubt, that they who have had it once thus in this way, are as well secur'd from having it again, as those who have had it favourably in the other way, which hath been prov'd by those that have had but one or two Pustules. Con∣stant Experience has also confirmed it in ma∣ny thousands of Instances. But what makes this Practice so valuable to us, in my Opinion is, that we shall escape the Violence, Rage and Hazard that we are expos'd to in the <HI>common way;</HI> except we are infected before,
<PB N="17" REF="002206_0019_0FDACC12187B0F30"/>
as we are certain poor Mrs. <HI>Esther Webb</HI> was—And even <HI>there</HI> we may hope that the Sores of the Inscisions may help to carry off the Morbifick matter, and save the Patient; for this Person is recovered, altho' she had one of the worst Sort that ever was known. And much more on this Head might be said, why this way of <HI>Infection</HI> is more safe and easy, than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat of the <HI>Common way,</HI> but this may suffice for the present.</P>
<P>And as to the <HI>Divinity,</HI> they would limit God in His Blessing of some one or other particular part, or particle of His lower Creation, us'd by the Physician or Surgeon to prevent, moderate, alter, or cure a Disease in their Patient; the which I never yet heard was denied the Physician or Surgeon to use as aforesaid by God or Man.</P>
<P>But for this I refer my self to the fol∣lowing Quaeries.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> As to the spiteful and scurrilous things written against me and this Practice, at present I shall take no further No∣tice of them, but remind the Writers of the ill natur'd Dog in the Fable, that would neither eat the Oats himself, nor let the Horse eat them: So neither will these use a true and certain way to save the Peoples Lives, nor are they willing to let any one else use it to save them.</P>

<HEAD>A Few Quaeries humbly Offered.</HEAD>
<P>I. IF it should be so that the Compassion of GOD to His Creatures, should Enlighten us with the Knowledge of a <HI>Sweat</HI> or a <HI>Purge,</HI> that would <HI>Certainly,</HI> or but <HI>Probably</HI> secure us from ever taking the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> I <HI>Enquire,</HI> Whether any People would be so very foolish, as to judge it <HI>Unlawful</HI> to take such a Remedy. Or, would not every Wise Man think, that all the <HI>Days of a whole Year,</HI> were too few to be turn'd into <HI>Days of Thanksgiv∣ing,</HI> for the Discovery of such a Blessing to a Miserable World? Let the matter of the <HI>Sweat</HI> or <HI>Purge</HI> be what they will; 'Tis all one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or <HI>that.</HI> Suppose it the Powder of <HI>Trade,</HI> or the Powder that <HI>Johannes Anglicus</HI> cured Agues with; or let it be a <HI>Succus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>:</HI> 'Tis all one for <HI>that!</HI></P>
<P>II. Physicians have very often given their Patients <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Salivation,</HI> to remove, yea, and sometimes to <HI>Prevent</HI> grievous Diseases. Thousands have Died in and from that O∣peration; yet because Thousands have got Good by it, the Operation is every Day re∣peated. There is no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y so Impertinent as to call this, a <HI>Tempting of Providence.</HI> I <HI>Enquire,</HI> Why a <HI>Despumation,</HI> or, An Opera∣tion that will, we must not say, <HI>Salivate,</HI> but we may say, <HI>Despumate,</HI> the matter that
<PB N="19" REF="002206_0021_0FDACC151DB88D10"/>
would be fuel for the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> at proper Orifices, can be more liable to Exceptions; Especially, when it was never yet known, that <HI>One Person has died</HI> under it or by it? Or, why may not the <HI>Succus Variolatus</HI> be used, as well as <HI>Mercury?</HI></P>
<P>III. It is Objected, That you <HI>Presume upon Providence</HI> in this Essay for the Prevention of the <HI>Small Pox;</HI> for <HI>you don't know whe∣ther you shall ever have the Small Pox, or no.</HI> I Answer, But what if it be as likely that I shall have it, as it is that my House will take Fire, when my Neighbours an Inch and half off, is in Flames. <HI>Pray, sit still, my Neighbour, your House is not yet on Fire: The Almighty can preserve it.</HI> But I Enquire, whether this Objection will not lie against all the <HI>Preventive Physick</HI> in the World? I don't Infallibly know, that I shall ever <HI>suffer</HI> the Disease I am going to <HI>prevent.</HI></P>
<P>IV. The Objection here is, I <HI>make my self Sick, when I am Well.</HI> But I again say, Will any Man decry all <HI>Preventing Physick,</HI> as Unlawful? Why do our Physicians encou∣rage People every <HI>Spring</HI> and <HI>Fall</HI> to take it? Don't People take the <HI>Poison</HI> of a <HI>Vomit</HI> into their very <HI>Stomachs,</HI> to <HI>prevent</HI> a Sickness a thousand times less to be feared, than the <HI>Small Pox?</HI> Why may not I as well take a <HI>Poison</HI> into my <HI>Arm,</HI> or my Leg, to prevent
<PB N="20" REF="002206_0022_0FDACC1698B3C6B8"/>
such a Malady. Many have Died of a <HI>Vomit.</HI> It is not yet known, that any <HI>one ever Died</HI> of the Operation, that is now so cavil'd at. To say that our SAVIOUR's words, <HI>The whole need not a Physician,</HI> forbid all <HI>preventing Physick,</HI> is a gross abuse of them. Besides, I am not whole, while I have the <HI>Fuel</HI> of the <HI>Small Pox</HI> lodging in me.</P>
<P>V. Meerly to prevent a little <HI>Headach,</HI> or some such sleight Malady, may not I apply such a <HI>Poison,</HI> as an <HI>Epispastic</HI> of <HI>Spanish Flies</HI> to my Arm; A <HI>Poison</HI> which will set the Hu∣mours of my Body all a working, and pene∣trate unto the very <HI>Bladder,</HI> and produce even a <HI>Bloody Urine</HI> there?</P>
<P>VI. But an <HI>Anxious Fear</HI> of the <HI>Small Pox;</HI> is not this an <HI>Evil Disease?</HI> Especi∣ally when I have it so near me, that 'tis next to a Miracle if I escape it? If I take <HI>Phy∣sick</HI> only to <HI>Remove</HI> and <HI>Prevent</HI> this <HI>Fear,</HI> it can't be said, that <HI>I make my self Sick before I have any Disease.</HI></P>
<P>VII. The Celebrated <HI>Sydenham</HI> advises, That <HI>Purges</HI> be used, before the Infection of the <HI>Small Pox</HI> be taken, which hopefully prepare the Body, to feel <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> and of the <HI>better <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪</HI> Will any be so Ridiculous as to count this Unlawful, under a frivilous pretence that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>know</HI> whether they shall have the <HI>Small Pox</HI> or no.</P>
<P>VIII. I humbly Enquire, whether the <HI>Sixth Commandment</HI> has not required us to
<PB N="21" REF="002206_0023_0FDACC18161C6298"/>
use Means that may be Lawfully used for the <HI>Preservation of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> &amp; others?</HI> And what is there Unlawful in what is nowproposed?</P>
<P>IX. There is a silly Cavil; <HI>We pray that the Small Pox may not spread; and yet we do our selves by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ansplantation spread it.</HI> But I <HI>Enquire</HI> whether People know what they Pray for? Our <HI>Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yers</HI> are that a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rous</HI> and <HI>Destructive Small Pox</HI> may not Spread. We do not Pray, that the use of an <HI>Effectual means</HI> to save our Lives from the Danger of <HI>Destruction</HI> by the Small Pox, may not be Revealed, Practiced &amp; Prospered.</P>
<P>X. It is <HI>Cavilled</HI> for to say <HI>Objected,</HI> would be too easy a w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd for such Impertinence) that this <HI>Now Way</HI> comes to us from the <HI>Heathen,</HI> and we Christians must not <HI>Learn the Way of the Heathen</HI> I Enquire, whether our Hippocrates were not an Heathen? And whether our <HI>Galen</HI> were not an <HI>Heathen?</HI> And whether we have not our <HI>Mithradate</HI> from the Heathen? And whether the first Inventer of our <HI>Tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> were not <HI>Nero's</HI> Physician? And whether we have not learnt some of our very Good Medicines from our <HI>Indians?</HI> But this <HI>New Way</HI> has been used by many Thou∣sands of <HI>Christ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ns;</HI> And it is from <HI>Christians</HI> we have the Communications of this New Way which we most rely upon. But are there none who pass for <HI>Cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Chris<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ns▪</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat are <HI>worse th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> And, Gentlemen Smoa∣kers, I pray w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m did you learn to Smoke of?</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="002206_0024_0FDACC1B420DD160"/>
XI. If it should be so, that a <HI>Despumation</HI> of the Blood made by applying the <HI>Succus Variolatus,</HI> would (by the Blessing of GOD) <HI>generally save the Lives</HI> of them that come under it, I Enquire, <HI>What they will have to Answer for,</HI> that by their Menaces and Out∣rages put a stop to such a <HI>General benefit?</HI> And I Enquire whether a Physician, who makes the <HI>Experiment upon Himself,</HI> that so many Thousands of precious Lives may (if it suc∣ceed well) be brought into a likely way of being preserved, &amp; prolonged, shall deserve to be treated as a <HI>Murderer;</HI> or not rather esteemed a <HI>General Benefactor.</HI></P>
<P>XII. Were not the <HI>Physicians</HI> a Great Body of them, up in Arms, against the use of the <HI>Cold Bath?</HI> But since it has cured a vast Varie∣ty of Diseases, and saved Thousands of Lives, has not the use of it now obtained, <HI>whither they will or no?</HI> And now they also recommend it.</P>
<P>When the use of the <HI>Jesuits Bark</HI> was first introduced, was there not as loud a Cry a∣gainst it, as can be imagined? Yea, Do not many to this Day ruine themselves by the use of it, with an indiscreet and preposterous ma∣nagement? But since Hundreds of Thousands of Lives have been saved by it, are not they generally counted very <HI>odd Physicians,</HI> who do not use it, as often as they have occasion!</P>
<P>I Enquire, whether any sort of Practice in the whole Art of Physick ever came to us with a stronger Recommendation than this of Inocu∣lation or Transplantation.</P>
