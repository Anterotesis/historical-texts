<HEAD>FRONTISPIECE OF VOL. I.</HEAD>
<P>PRESENTS the inside view of a church—the floor, the pillars, and the walls, are interspersed with sepulchral stones, and funeral in∣scriptions—on one side, is the monument of an infant, adorned with an urn, with a weeping statue, and inscribed with the following Epi∣taph—NASCENTES MORIMUR—<HI>No sooner born, than dead</HI>—on a more elevated tomb, and under an assemblage of military weapons, is portrayed a warrior, supposed to be mortally wounded, expiring in the attitude of adoration, and with the spirit of that noble line,
<Q>"O! save my Country, Heav'n!"—shall be thy last.</Q>
A youth, beholding the representation of this gallant patriot, seems to be struck with admiration, and charmed with delight. A minis∣ter diverts his attention to an object of infinitely higher dignity, and greater wonder. If the hero died—PRO PATRIA, <HI>In defence of his country,</HI> CHRIST died—PRO INIMICIS, <HI>For the salvation of his enemies.</HI> An instance this, of such disinterested, diffusive, and di∣vine benevolence; as makes all that heroes have achieved, and patri∣ots suffered, dwindle into nothing, and scarce deserve our notice.</P>

<L>The shepherds' cottages, the rural folds:</L>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THESE reflections, the one on the <HI>deepest,</HI> the other on the <HI>gayest</HI> scenes of nature, when they proceeded privately from the <HI>pen,</HI> were addressed to a lady of the most valuable endowments; who crown∣ed all her other endearing qualities, by a fervent love of CHRIST, and an exemplary conformity to his divine pattern. She, alas! lives no longer on earth; unless it be in the honours of a distinguished character, and in the bleeding remembrance of her acquaintance.</P>
<P>It is impossible, Madam, to wish you a richer blessing, or a more substantial happiness, than that the same spirit of unfeigned <HI>faith,</HI> the same course of undefiled <HI>religion,</HI> which have enabled her to triumph over death, may both animate and adorn your life. And you will per∣mit me to declare, that my chief inducement in request∣ing your acceptance of the following meditations, now they make a publick appearance from the <HI>press,</HI> is, that they are designed to cultivate the same sacred <HI>principle,</HI> and to promote the same excellent <HI>practice.</HI></P>
<P>Long, Madam, may you <HI>bloom</HI> in all the vivacity and amiableness of youth, like the charming subject of one of these contemplations. But at the same time remember,
<PB N="18" REF="021885_0017_0FB5EFD583FEC420"/>
that, with regard to such inferiour accomplishments, you must one day <HI>fade,</HI> (may it prove some very remote pe∣riod!) like the mournful objects of the other. This consideration will prompt you to go on, as you have be∣gun, in adding the <HI>meekness</HI> of <HI>wisdom,</HI> and all the <HI>beauties</HI> of <HI>holiness,</HI> to the graces of an engaging person, and the refinements of a polite education.</P>
<P>And might—O! might the ensuing hints furnish you with the least assistance, in prosecuting so desirable an end; might they contribute, in any degree, to establish your faith, or elevate your devotion; they would then administer to the author such a satisfaction, as applause cannot give, nor censure take away: A satisfaction which I should be able to enjoy, even in those awful moments, when all that captivates the eye is sinking in darkness, and every glory of this lower world disappear∣ing forever.</P>
<P>These wishes, Madam, as they are a most agreeable employ of my thoughts, so they come attended with this additional circumstance of pleasure, that they are also the sincerest expression of that very great esteem, with which I am.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE first of these occasional meditations, begs leave to remind my readers of their <HI>latter end;</HI> and would invite them to set, not their houses only, but, which is inexpressibly more needful, their souls, in order: That they may be able, through all the intermediate stages, to look forward upon their approaching exit, without any <HI>anxious apprehen∣sions;</HI> and, when the great change commences, may bid adieu to terrestrial things, with all the <HI>calmness</HI> of a cheerful resigna∣tion, with all the <HI>comforts</HI> of a well grounded faith.</P>
<P>The other attempts to sketch out some little traces of the <HI>all suf∣ficiency</HI> of our <HI>Redeemer,</HI> for the grand and gracious purposes of everlasting salvation: That a sense of his unutterable dig∣nity, and infinite perfections, may incite us to regard him, with sentiments of the most profound <HI>veneration;</HI> to long for an as∣sured interest in his merits, with all the ardency of <HI>desire;</HI> and to trust in his powerful mediation, with an <HI>affiance</HI> not to be shaken by any temptations, not to be shared with any perform∣ances of our own.</P>
<P>I flatter myself, that the thoughts conceived among the <HI>tombs</HI> may be welcome to the <HI>serious</HI> and <HI>humane</HI> mind. Because, as there are few who have not consigned the remains of some dear <HI>relations,</HI> or honoured <HI>friends,</HI> to those silent repositories; so there are none but must be sensible, that this is the <HI>house ap∣pointed for all living;</HI> and that they themselves are shortly to remove into the same solemn mansions.—And who would not
<PB N="20" REF="021885_0019_0FB5EFDE4B7939B0"/>
turn aside, for a while, from the most favourite amusements, to view the <HI>place</HI> where his once loved <HI>companions</HI> lie? Who would not sometimes survey those <HI>apartments</HI> where he <HI>him∣self</HI> is to take up an <HI>abode,</HI> till time shall be no more?</P>
<P>As to the other little essay, may I not humbly presume, that the very subject itself will recommend the remarks? For, who is not delighted with the prospect of the blooming creation, and even charmed with the <HI>delicate attractions</HI> of flowers? Who does not covet to assemble them in the garden, or wear them in a nosegay? Since this is a passion so universal, who would not be willing to render it productive of the sublimest improvement? —This piece of <HI>holy frugality,</HI> I have ventured to suggest, and endeavoured to exemplify, in the second letter; that, while the hand is cropping the transient beauties of a flower, the attentive mind may be enriching itself with solid and lasting good.—And I cannot but entertain some pleasing hopes, that the nicest taste may receive and relish <HI>religious impressions,</HI> when they are conveyed by such <HI>lovely monitors;</HI> when the instructive les∣sons are found, not on the leaves of some formidable <HI>folio,</HI> but stand legible on the fine <HI>sarcenet</HI> of a <HI>Narcissus;</HI> when they savour, not of the <HI>lamp</HI> and <HI>recluse,</HI> but come breathing from the fragrant bosom of a <HI>Jonquil.</HI></P>

righteous; the rest of their bodies; the calmness of their depar∣ture; the safety of their disembodied souls; their delightful situation till the judgment day—Monument of a warrior, slain in battle; reflections on the death of CHRIST, that it was voluntary, foreseen, undergone for enemies; was most tortu∣rous, lingering, and ignominious—The meanness of being o∣bliged to a monument for perpetuating our names; author's wish for himself; true method of eternizing our characters—The vault; its awful aspect; grandeur in abasement; the vanity of pleasures, honours, and riches—The clock strikes; a warning to redeem the time—The wonderful change which takes place in the tomb, displayed in several particulars—Solil∣oquy of a lover; admonition to the ladies; true beauty of the fair sex—Sin the cause of our dissolution—Subject of mortality brought home to our own case; incitement to improve life; this the best embalming—View of our Saviour's sepulchre; his lying in the grave has softened it for his people; faith in his dying love disarms death—The resurrection of the righteous; their meeting the judge; their acceptance at the great tribunal— Sickness, sin, and death, destroyed; bliss or misery unchangea∣ble; observations on eternity—The wicked; the anguish of their last sickness.

<HEAD><HI>REFLECTIONS</HI> on a <HI>FLOWER GARDEN.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WALK in the garden; summer morning; a soaring lark; invitation to early rising—Vastness of the heavens; greater ex∣tent of divine mercy—The sun; its rising glories; emblem of CHRIST, in its enlightening, fructifying, cheering, and exten∣sive influences—Dews; their transient brightness; their refresh∣ing nature; their immense number—Difficult passage in the Psalms cleared up—The various, but harmonious, procedure of Providence and Grace—View of the country, and its principal productions; particularly of an orchard and kitchen garden; chiefly characterized as useful—CHRIST made and recovered,
<PB N="23" REF="021885_0022_0FB5EFE222B671B0"/>
upholds and actuates all; address to mankind on this occasion—Observations contracted to the garden; fields of literature left for the study of the Bible—Fragrance of flowers; its fugi∣tive nature, another motive to shake off sloth; the delightful sen∣sation it creates, faint representation of CHRIST's sacrifice; all our performances polluted, this the cause of our acceptance—Colours of flowers, how perfect in every kind; with what skill disposed; fineness of the flowery texture; inducement to trust in Providence—The folly of pride in dress; our true orna∣ments displayed—Flowers naturally inspire delight; what pleasure must arise from the beatifick vision—<HI>Solomon</HI> pictures out the blessed JESUS by the most delicate flowers; beauties in the creature lead us to the Creator—Diversity of flowers, in their airs, habits, attitudes, and lineaments; wisdom of the Almighty Maker; the perfection and simplicity of his operations—Differ∣ence between individuals of the same species; emblem of the smaller differences among protestants—Regular succession of flowers; some of the choicest sets described; pleasing effects pro∣duced by this economy; a benevolent Providence apparent in conducting it—This beautiful disposition, and all that is admira∣ble in the creation, referred to CHRIST as the author; to con∣sider the things that are made, in this view, has excellent influ∣ence on our faith and love—The structure of flowers so correct, could not be altered, but to their prejudice; the time of their ap∣pearing, chosen with the nicest precaution; these circumstances, a striking argument for resignation to the disposals of Heaven— Quotations from <HI>Casimir</HI> and <HI>Juvenal</HI> translated—A favour∣ite tenet of Mr. <HI>Pope's</HI> rightly stated—The brute creatures un∣affected with flowers; their fine qualities peculiarly intended to delight mankind; all things constituted with a particular regard to our advantage; this, an endearing obligation to gratitude; but a more engaging motive, is the gift of an im∣mortal soul—Remark on the notion of a great poet—The culti∣vated garden an image of a well nurtured mind; address to persons concerned in the education of youth—Flowers in the bud, figurative of a niggard; flowers in full expansion, expressive of a benevolent disposition—Sun flower; its remarkable attach∣ment to the sun; such should be our adherence to the Saviour—Passion flower; its description; with a religious improvement—Sensitive plant; shrinks from every touch; such should be our solicitous care to avoid sin—The delicacy of flowers, and coarse∣ness of their roots; the ennobling change of our bodies at the resurrection; this should reconcile us to the thoughts of dissolution—Passage from <HI>Theocritus;</HI> the perfections of flowers soon decay; the charms of complexion scarce more lasting—Instances of transitory continuance in the noblest flowers; the honours of the future state unfading—All the delights of the flowery season pass away; the celestial entertainments know no end—Not flow∣ers only, but the most durable things in nature, are perishing;

their felicity stable, who have GOD for their portion—Retreat into an arbour; practice of St. <HI>Augustine,</HI> pattern for our im∣itation—Coolness of this shady situation; the insufferable heat that rages abroad; our safety in all the dangers of life, and amidst the terrours of eternal judgment, if sheltered by the Re∣deemer's protection, and interested in his merits—The bees; their ingenuity; their industry; set an example for the author —A distant prospect of the whole scene, with its various deco∣rations, reminds the beholder of Heaven; its glories not to be described, but most passionately desired.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">In a LETTER to a LADY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>RAVELLING lately into <HI>Cornwall,</HI> I happened to alight at a considerable Village, in that county: Where, finding myself under an unexpected necessity of staying a little, I took a walk to the <HI>Church.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I had named, in some former editions, a particular church, <HI>viz.</HI> KILKHAMPTON; where several of the monuments, described in the following pages, really exist. But as I thought it convenient, to mention some cases <HI>here,</HI> which are not, according to the best of my remembrance, referred to in any inscriptions <HI>there</HI>; I have now omitted the name. That imagination might operate more freely, and the im∣provement of the reader be consulted, without any thing that should look like a variation from truth and fact.</NOTE> The doors, like the heaven to which they lead, were wide open; and readily ad∣mitted an unworthy stranger. Pleased with the op∣portunity, I resolved to spend a few minutes under the sacred roof.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="021885_0025_0FB5EFE80E198328"/>In a situation so retired and awful, I could not avoid falling into a train of meditations, <HI>serious</HI> and <HI>mournfully pleasing.</HI> Which, I trust, were in some degree profitable to <HI>me,</HI> while they possessed and warmed my thoughts; and, if they may administer any satisfaction to <HI>you,</HI> Madam, now they are recollected, and committed to writing, I shall receive a fresh pleasure from them.</P>
<P>It was an ancient pile; reared by hands, that, ages ago, were mouldered into dust.—Situate in the centre of a large <HI>burial ground;</HI> remote from all the noise and hurry of tumultuous life.—The body spacious; the structure lofty; the whole magnificently plain. A row of regular pillars extended themselves through the midst; supporting the roof with simplicity, and with dignity.— The light, that passed through the windows, seemed to shed a kind of <HI>luminous Obscurity;</HI> which gave every ob∣ject a grave and venerable air.—The deep <HI>Silence,</HI> added to the gloomy aspect, and both heightened by the lone∣liness of the place, greatly increased the solemnity of the scene.—A sort of <HI>religious Dread</HI> stole insensibly on my mind, while I advanced, all pensive and thought∣ful, along the inmost aisle. Such a dread, as hushed every ruder passion, and dissipated all the gay images of an alluring world.</P>
<P>Having adored that Eternal Majesty, who, far from being confined to temples made with hands, has Heaven for his throne, and the Earth for his foot∣stool—I took particular notice of a handsome <HI>Altar piece</HI>; presented, as I was afterwards informed, by the master builders of <HI>Stow</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Name of a grand seat, belonging to the late Earl of <HI>Bath</HI>; remarkable formerly for its excellent workmanship, and elegant fur∣niture; once the principal resort of the quality and gentry of the West; but now demolished, laid even with the ground, and scarce one stone left upon another.—So that corn may grow, or nettles spring, where <HI>Stow</HI> lately stood.</NOTE>; out of gratitude, I presume, to that gracious GOD, who carried them through their work, and enabled them to
<Q>bring forth their topstone with joy.</Q></P>
<P>O! HOW amiable is <HI>Gratitude!</HI> especially when it has the supreme Benefactor for its object. I have al∣ways
<PB N="3" REF="021885_0026_0FB5EFEE52816188"/>
looked upon gratitude as the most exalted princi∣ple that can actuate the heart of man. It has some∣thing noble, disinterested, and (if I may be allowed the Term) generously devout. <HI>Repentance</HI> indicates our nature fallen, and <HI>Prayer</HI> turns chiefly upon a regard to one's self. But the exercises of gratitude subsisted in paradise, when there was no fault to deplore; and will be perpetuated in Heaven, when
<Q>GOD shall be all in all.</Q></P>
<P>The language of this sweet temper is,
<Q>I am un∣speakably obliged: What return shall I make?</Q>
— And, surely, it is no improper expression of an unfeign∣ed thankfulness, to decorate our Creator's courts, and <HI>beautify</HI> "the <HI>place</HI> where his honour dwelleth." Of old, the habitation of his feet was glorious: Let it not, now, be sordid or contemptible. It must grieve an in∣genuous mind, and be a reproach to any people, to have their own houses wainscotted with cedar, and painted with vermillion; while the temple of the Lord of hosts is destitute of every decent ornament.</P>
<P>Here I recollected, and was charmed with <HI>Solomon</HI>'s fine address to the almighty, at the <HI>dedication</HI> of his famous temple. With immense charge, and exquisite skill, he had erected the most rich and finished struc∣ture, that the sun ever saw. Yet, upon a review of his work, and a reflection on the transcendent perfections of the Godhead, how he exalts the one and abases the other!—The building was too <HI>glorious,</HI> for the mightiest monarch to inhabit; too <HI>sacred</HI> for unhallowed feet even to enter; yet infinitely too <HI>mean,</HI> for the Deity to reside in. It was, and the royal worshipper acknow∣ledged it to be, a most marvellous vouchsafement in un∣created excellency, to "put his name there."—The whole passage breathes such a delicacy, and is animated with such a sublimity of sentiment, that I cannot per∣suade myself to pass on, without repeating it. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Kings,</HI> viii.27. <HI>But will</HI>—A fine abrupt beginning, most sig∣nificantly describing the amazement and rapture of the royal pro∣phet's mind!—<HI>GOD:</HI> He uses no epithet, where writers of infe∣riour discernment would have been found to multiply them: But speaks of the Deity, as an incomprehensible Being, whose perfections and glories are exalted above all praise.—<HI>Dwell:</HI> To bestow on sinful creatures a propitious look; to favour them with a transient visit of kindness; even this were an unutterable obligation. Will he then vouchsafe to fix his abode among them, and take up his stated resi∣dence with them?—<HI>Indeed:</HI> A word, in this connexion, peculiarly emphatical; expressive of a condescension, wonderful and extraordinary almost beyond all credibility. <HI>Behold:</HI> intimating the continued, or rather the increasing surprise of the speaker, and awakening the attention of the hearer. <HI>Behold! the Heaven:</HI> The spacious concave of the firmament; that wide extended azure circumference, in which worlds unnumbered perform their revolutions, is too scanty an apartment for the Godhead.—Nay, <HI>The Heaven of Heavens:</HI> Those vastly higher tracts, which be far beyond the limits of human survey; to which our very thoughts can hardly soar: even these (unbounded as they are) cannot afford an adequate habitation for JEHOVAH; even these dwindle into a point, when compared with the infinitude of his essence; even these
<Q>are as nothing before him.</Q>
—<HI>How much less</HI> proportionate is this poor diminutive speek (which I have been erecting and embellishing), to so august a Presence, so immense a Majesty!</NOTE><HI>But will
<PB N="4" REF="021885_0027_0FB5EFEF903DB700"/>
GOD indeed dwell on earth? Behold! The Heaven, and Heaven of Heavens, cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded!</HI>—Incomparable saying! worthy the wisest of men. Who would not choose to possess such an elevated devotion, rather than to own all the glittering materials of that sumptuous edifice?</P>
<P>We are apt to be struck with admiration at the state∣liness and grandeur of a masterly performance in archi∣tecture. And, perhaps on a sight of the ancient Sanc∣tuary, should have made the <HI>superficial</HI> observation of the disciples;
<Q>What manner of stones, and what build∣ings are here!</Q>
—But what a <HI>nobler</HI> turn of thought, and <HI>juster</HI> taste of things, does it discover; to join with <HI>Israel</HI>'s king, in celebrating the condescension of the Di∣vine Inhabitant! That the High and Lofty One, who fills immensity with his glory, should, in a peculiar manner, fix his abode there! Should <HI>there</HI> manifest an extraordinary degree of his benedictive presence; per∣mit sinful mortals to approach his Majesty; and promise "to make them joyful in his house of prayer!—<HI>This</HI> should more sensibly affect our hearts, than the most cu∣rious arrangement of stones can delight our eyes.</P>
<P>Nay, the everlasting GOD does not disdain to dwell in our <HI>souls</HI> by his holy spirit; and to make even our
<PB N="5" REF="021885_0028_0FB5EFF2A6B27A98"/>
<HI>bodies</HI> his temple.—Tell me, ye that frame critical judg∣ments, and balance nicely the distinction of things; "Is this most astonishing or most rejoicing?"—He hum∣bleth himself, the scripture assures us, even to behold the things that are in Heaven<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. cxiii.6.</NOTE>. 'Tis a most condescend∣ing favour, if HE pleases to take the least approving no∣tice of Angels and Archangels, when they bow down in homage from their celestial thrones. Will he then gra∣ciously regard, will he be united, most <HI>intimately united</HI> to poor, polluted breathing dust?—Unparallelled honour! invaluable privilege! Be this my portion, and I shall not covet crowns, nor envy conquerors.</P>
<P>But let me remember, what a <HI>sanctity</HI> of disposition, and <HI>uprightness</HI> of conversation, so exalted a relation de∣mands: Remember this, "and rejoice with trembling." —Durst I commit any iniquity, while I tread these hallow∣ed courts? could the <HI>Jewish</HI> high priest allow himself in any known transgression, while he made that solemn yearly entrance<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. ix.7.</NOTE> into the Holy of Holies, and stood before the immediate presence of <HI>JEHOVAH?</HI> No, truly. In <HI>such</HI> circumstances, a thinking person must shudder at the most remote solicitation, to any wilful of∣fence.

<P>The next thing, which engaged my attention, was the <HI>lettered floor.</HI> The pavement, somewhat like <HI>Ezekiel</HI>'s roll, was written over from one end to the other. I soon perceived the comparison to hold good, in another re∣spect; and the inscriptions to be matter of
<Q>Mourning, lamentation, <HI>and</HI> woe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ezek. ii.10.</NOTE>.</Q>
They seemed to court my observation; silently inviting me to read them. And what would these dumb monitors inform me of?—
<Q>That, beneath their little circumferences, were deposited such and such pieces of clay, which once <HI>lived,</HI> and <HI>moved,</HI> and <HI>talked:</HI> That they had received a charge to preserve their names, and were the remaining trus∣tees of their memory.</Q></P>

<P>Examining the records of mortality, I found the memorials of a <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mista senum ac juvenum densantur funera. <BIBL><HI>HOR.</HI></BIBL></NOTE> <HI>promiscuous</HI> multitude. They were hud∣dled, at least they rested together, without any re∣gard to rank or seniority. None were ambitious of the uppermost rooms, or chief seats, in this house of mourn∣ing. None entertained fond and eager expectations of being honourably greeted, in their darksome cells. The man of years and experience, reputed as an Oracle in his generation, was content to lie down at the feet of a babe. In this house appointed for all living, the ser∣vant was equally accommodated, and lodged in the same story with his master. The <HI>poor indigent</HI> lay as softly, and slept as soundly, as the most <HI>opulent possessor.</HI> All the distinction that subsisted, was, a grassy hillock, bound with ofiers; or a sepulchral stone, ornamented with imagery.</P>
<P>Why then, said my working thoughts, O! why should we raise such a mighty stir, about <HI>superiority</HI> and
<PB N="8" REF="021885_0031_0FB5EFFAD12B9588"/>
<HI>precedence;</HI> when the next remove will reduce us all to a state of equal meanness? Why should we exalt our∣selves, or debase others; since we must all, one day, be upon a common level, and blended together in the same undistinguished dust? O! that this consideration might humble my own, and others pride; and sink our imag∣ination as low, as our habitation will shortly be!</P>
<P>Among these confused relicks of humanity, there are, without doubt, persons of <HI>contrary</HI> interests, and <HI>contra∣dicting</HI> sentiments. But Death, like some able days∣man, has laid his hand on the contending parties; and brought all their differences to an <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><L>Hi motus animorum, atque haec certamina tanta,</L>

Perhaps, their crumbling bones <HI>mix</HI> as they <HI>moulder:</HI> and those who, while they lived, stood aloof in irreconcilable variance; here fall into mutual embraces, and even incorporate with each other in the grave.

<P><PB N="10" REF="021885_0033_0FB5EFFDD517D760"/>At the same time, let <HI>survivors,</HI> doomed to <HI>bear the heat and burden of the day,</HI> for their encouragement re∣flect—That it is more honourable to have entered the lists, and to have fought the good fight, before they come off conquerors. They who have bore the cross, and submitted to afflictive providences, with a cheerful resignation; have girded up the loins of their mind, and performed their Master's will, with an honest and persevering fidelity:—These, having glorified their Redeemer on earth, will, probably, be as stars of the <HI>first magnitude</HI> in heaven. They will shine with bright∣er beams, be replenished with stronger joys, in their LORD's everlasting kingdom.</P>
<P>Here lies the grief of a fond mother, and the blast∣ed expectation of an indulgent father.—The <HI>youth</HI> grew up, like a well watered plant; he shot deep, rose high, and bid fair for manhood. But just as the <HI>cedar</HI> began to tower, and promised, ere long, to be the pride of the wood, and prince among the neighbouring trees—Be∣hold! the <HI>ax</HI> is laid unto the root; the fatal blow struck; and all its branching honours tumbled to the dust.— And did he fall alone? No: The hopes of his father that begat him, and the pleasing prospects of her that bare him, fell, and were crushed together with him.</P>
<P>Doubtless, it would have pierced one's heart, to have beheld the tender parents, following the breathless youth, to his long home. Perhaps, drowned in tears, and all overwhelmed with sorrows, they stood, like weep∣ing statues, on this very spot.—Methinks, I see the deeply distressed mourners attending the sad solemnity. How they wring their hands, and pour floods from their eyes!—Is it fancy? or do I really hear the passionate <HI>mother,</HI> in an agony of affliction taking her final leave of the darling of her soul? dumb she remained, while the awful obsequies were performing; dumb with grief, and leaning upon the partner of her woes. But now the inward anguish struggles for vent; it grows too big to be repressed. She advances to the brink of the grave▪ all her soul is in her eyes. She fastens one more look upon the <HI>dear doleful</HI> object, before the pit shuts its mouth upon him. And as she looks, she cries;—in broken ac∣cents,
<PB N="11" REF="021885_0034_0FB5F0030DDEE358"/>
interrupted by many a rising sob, she cries—
<Q>Fare∣wel, my son! my son! my only beloved! Would to GOD I had died for thee!—Farewel, my child! and farewel all my earthly happiness!—I shall never more see good, in the land of the living.—Attempt not to comfort me, I will go mourning, all my days, till my grey hairs come down, with sorrow, to the grave.</Q></P>
<P>From this affecting representation, let parents be con∣vinced, how highly it concerns them to cultivate the <HI>morals,</HI> and secure the <HI>immortal</HI> interests of their children. —If you really love the offspring of your own bodies; if your bowels yearn over those amiable pledges of conju∣gal endearment; spare no pains; give all diligence, I intreat you, to
<Q>bring them up in the nurture and ad∣monition of the LORD.</Q>
Then, may you have joy in their life, or consolation in their death. If their span is <HI>prolonged</HI>; their unblamable and useful conduct, will be the staff of your age, and a balm for declining na∣ture. Or, if the number of their years be cut off in the <HI>midst;</HI> you may commit their remains to the dust, with much the same comfortable expectations, as you send the survivors to places of genteel education. You may com∣mit them to the dust, with cheering hopes of receiving them again to your arms, <HI>inexpressibly improved</HI> in every noble and endearing accomplishment.</P>
<P>'Tis certainly a <HI>severe trial</HI>; and much more afflictive, than I am able to imagine; to resign a lovely blooming creature, sprung from your own loins, to the gloomy recesses of corruption. <HI>Thus</HI> to resign him, after having been long dandled upon your knees; united to your affections by a thousand ties of tenderness; and now become, both the delight of your eyes, and the support of your family!—To have such a one torn from your bo∣som, and thrown into darkness; doubtless, it must be like a dagger in your hearts.—But O! how much more cutting to you, and confounding to the child, to have the soul separated from GOD; and, for <HI>shameful ignorance,</HI> or <HI>early impiety,</HI> transmitted to places of eternal torment! How would it aggravate your distress, and add a distract∣ing <HI>Emphasis</HI> to all your sighs, if you should follow the pale corpse with these bitter reflections!—
<Q>This dear creature though long ago capable of knowing good
<PB N="12" REF="021885_0035_0FB5F00CF3BD2DA0"/>
from evil, is gone <HI>out</HI> of the world before it had learned the great disign of coming <HI>into</HI> it. A short lived momentary existence, it received from me; but no good instructions, no holy admonitions, nothing to further its well being in that everlasting state, upon which it is now entered. The <HI>poor body</HI> is consigned to the coffin, and carried out to consume away, in the cold and silent grave. And what reason have I to sup∣pose, that the <HI>precious soul</HI> is in a better condition? May I not justly fear, that, sentenced by the righteous judge, it is going, or gone away, into the pains of endless punishment?—Perhaps, while I am <HI>bewailing</HI> its untimely departure, it may be <HI>cursing,</HI> in outer darkness, that ever to be deplored, that most calami∣tous day, when it was born of such a careless, ungodly parent, as I have been.</Q></P>
<P>Nothing, I think, but the gnawings of that worm which never dies, can equal the anguish of these self-condemning thoughts. The tortures of a rack must be an easy suffering, compared with the stings and hor∣rour of such a remorse.—How earnestly do I wish, that as many as are intrusted with the management of children, would take timely care to prevent these scourges of con∣science; by endeavouring to conduct their minds into an early <HI>knowledge</HI> of Christ, and a cordial <HI>love</HI> of his truth!</P>
<P>On this hand is lodged one, whose sepulchral stone tells a most pitiable tale indeed! Well may the <HI>little images,</HI> reclined over the sleeping ashes, hang down their heads with that pensive air! None can consider so mourn∣ful a story, without feeling some touches of sympathiz∣ing concern.—His <HI>age</HI> twenty eight; his death, <HI>sud∣den</HI>; himself cut down in the prime of life, amidst all the vivacity and vigour of manhood; while
<Q>his breasts were full of milk, and his bones moistened with marrow.</Q>
—Probably he entertained no appre∣hensions of the evil hour. And indeed who could have suspected, that so bright a sun should go down at noon? To human appearance, his hill stood strong. Length of days seemed written in his sanguine countenance. He solaced himself with the prospect of a long, long series of earthly satisfactions.—When, lo! an unexpected stroke

Unto this he must be conveyed, not with a splendid procession of <HI>joyous attendants</HI>; but stretched in the <HI>gloomy hearse,</HI> and followed by a train of mourners. On this he must take up a lonely lodging, nor ever be released, "till the heavens are no more."— In vain does the consenting <HI>fair one</HI> put on her ornaments, and expect her spouse. Did she not, like <HI>Sisera</HI>'s moth∣er, look out of the lattice; chide the delays of her beloved; and wonder
<Q>why his chariot was so long in coming?</Q>
Little thinking, that the <HI>intended</HI> bridegroom had forever done with transitory things; that now ever∣lasting cares employ his mind, without one single re∣membrance of his lovely <HI>Lucinda</HI>!

<P>Hitherto, one is tempted to exclaim against the king of terrours, and call him <HI>capriciously cruel.</HI> He seems, by beginning at the wrong end of the register, to have inverted the laws of nature.

passing bells, inculcate loudly our LORD's admonition;
<Q>Take ye heed, watch and pray; for ye know not, when the time is.</Q>
—We nod, like intoxicated crea∣tures, upon the very verge of a most tremendous preci∣pice. These astonishing dispensations, are the kind mes∣sengers of Heaven; to <HI>rouse</HI> us from our <HI>supineness,</HI> and quicken us into timely circumspection. I need not, sure∣ly, accommodate them with language, nor act as their in∣terpreter. Let every one's conscience be awake, and this will appear their awful meaning—
<Q>O! ye sons of men, in the midst of life you are in death. No state, no cir∣cumstances, can ascertain your preservation a single moment. So <HI>strong</HI> is the tyrant's arm, that nothing can resist its force; so <HI>true</HI> his aim, that nothing can elude the blow. <HI>Sudden</HI> as lightning, sometimes, is his arrow launched; and wounds, and kills, in the twinkling of an eye. Never promise yourselves safe∣ty in any expedient, but constant preparation. The fatal shafts fly so promiscuously, that none can guess the next victim. Therefore, <HI>be ye always ready: For in such an hour as ye think not,</HI> the final summons cometh.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Be ye always ready: For in such an hour as ye think not</HI>— Important admonition! methinks, it reverberates from sepulchre to sepulchre; and addresses me with line up∣on line, precept upon precept.—The reiterated warn∣ing, I acknowledge, is too needful; may cooperating grace, render it effectual! The momentous truth, though worthy to be <HI>engraved,</HI> on the tables of a most tenacious memory; is but shightly <HI>sketched,</HI> on the transient flow of passion. We see our neighbours fall; we turn pale at the shock: and feel, perhaps, a trembling dread. No sooner are they removed from our sight; but, driven in the whirl of business, or lulled in the languors of pleasure, we forget the providence, and neglect its errand. The impression made on our unstable minds, is like the trace of an arrow, through the penetrated air; or the path of a keel, in the furrowed wave.— Strange stupidity! To cure it, another monitor bespeaks me, from a neighbouring stone. It contains the narra∣tive of an unhappy mortal, snatched from his friends,
<PB N="16" REF="021885_0039_0FB5F018D4797868"/>
and hurried to the awful bar; without leisure, either to take a <HI>last farewel</HI> of the one, or to put up so much as a <HI>single prayer</HI> preparatory for the other: killed, accord∣ing to the usual expression, by a sudden stroke of cas∣ualty.</P>
<P>Was it then a random stroke? Doubtless, the blow came from an <HI>aiming</HI> though invisible hand. GOD presideth over the armies of heaven; GOD ruleth a∣mong the inhabitants of the earth; and GOD conduct∣eth what men call <HI>chance.</HI> Nothing, nothing comes to pass through a blind and undiscerning fatality. If acci∣dents happen; they happen according to the exact fore∣knowledge, and conformably to the determinate counsels, of eternal wisdom. The LORD, with whom are the issues of death, signs the <HI>warrant,</HI> and gives the high commission. The seemingly fortuitous disaster is only the <HI>agent,</HI> or the <HI>instrument,</HI> appointed to execute the supreme decree. When the king of <HI>Israel</HI> was mortally wounded, it seemed to be a casual shot. <HI>A certain man drew a bow at a venture</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Kings xxii.34.</NOTE>.—<HI>At a venture,</HI> as he thought. But his hand was strengthened, by an omnipotent aid; and the shaft levelled, by an unerring eye. So that, what we term <HI>casualty,</HI> is really <HI>providence;</HI> accomplishing delibe∣rate designs, but concealing its own interposition.—How comforting this reflection! Admirably adapted, to sooth the throbbing anguish of the mourners, and compose their spirits into a quiet submission! Excellently suited, to dissipate the fears of godly survivors, and create a calm intrepidity even amidst innumerable perils!</P>
<P>How <HI>thin</HI> is the partition, between this world and another! How <HI>short</HI> the transition, from time to eter∣nity! The partition, nothing more than the breath in our nostrils; and the transition may be made in the twink∣ling of an eye. Poor <HI>Chremylus,</HI> I remember, arose from the diversion of a card table, and dropt into the dwellings of darkness. One night, <HI>Corinna</HI> was all gaiety in her spirits, all finery in her apparel, at a magnificent ball. The next night, she lay pale and stiff, an extended corpse, and ready to be mingled with the mouldering dead. Young <HI>Atticus</HI> lived to see his ample and commo∣dious

seat completed; but not to spend one joyous hour, under the stately roof. The sashes were hung, to ad∣mit the day; but the master's eyes are closed in endless night. The apartments were furnished, to invite so∣ciety, or administer repose; but their lord rests in the lower parts of the earth, in the solitary, silent chambers of the tomb. The gardens were planned, and a thou∣sand elegant decoratious designed; but alas! their in∣tended possessor, is gone down to "the place of skulls;" is gone down to the valley of the shadow of death.</P>
<P>While I am recollecting, many, I question not, are experiencing the same tragical vicissitude. The eyes of that sublime being—who sits upon the circle of the earth, and views all its inhabitants with one comprehensive glance—even now behold many tents in affliction. Such affliction as overwhelmed the <HI>Egyptians</HI> in that fatal night, when the destroying angel sheathed his ar∣rows in all the pride of their strength.—Some, sinking to the floor from their <HI>easy chair;</HI> and deaf even amidst the piercing shrieks of their distracted relations.—Some giving up the ghost, as they sit retired, or lie reclined under the <HI>shady arbour,</HI> to taste the sweets of the flowery scene.—Some, as they sail, associated with a <HI>party</HI> of <HI>pleasure,</HI> along the dancing stream, and through the laughing meads. Nor is the grim intruder mollified, though wine and musick flow around. Some <HI>intercepted,</HI> as they are returning home; and some <HI>interrupted,</HI> as they enter upon an important negotiation.—Some ar∣rested, with the gain of <HI>injustice</HI> in their hands; and some surprised in the very act of <HI>lewdness,</HI> or the attempt of <HI>cruelty.</HI></P>
<P>Legions, legions of disasters, such as no prudence can foresee, and no care prevent, lie in wait to accom∣plish our doom.

Even a single <HI>tile,</HI> dropping from the roof, may be as fatal as the fall of the whole structure.—So frail, so very attenuated is the thread of life, that it not only bursts before the <HI>storm,</HI> but breaks even at a <HI>breeze.</HI> The most common occurrences, those
<PB N="18" REF="021885_0041_0FB5F0234F44D040"/>
from which we suspect not the least harm, may prove the weapon of our destruction, a grape stone, a despi∣cable fly, may be more mortal than <HI>Goliath,</HI> with all his formidable armour.—Nay, if GOD give command, our very <HI>comforts</HI> become <HI>killing.</HI> The air we breathe, is our bane; and the food we eat, the vehicle of death.— That last enemy has unnumbered avenues for his ap∣proach. Yea; lies intrenched in our very bosom, and holds his fortress in the seat of our life. The crimson fluid, which <HI>distributes health,</HI> is impregnated with the seeds of death. Heat may inflame it, or toil oppress it; and make it destroy the parts, it was designed to cher∣ish. Some unseen impediment may obstruct its passage, or some unknown violence may divert its course; in either of which cases, it acts the part of a poisonous draught, or a deadly stab.</P>
<Q><L>Ah! in what perils is vain life engag'd!</L>
<L>What slight neglects, what trivial faults destroy</L>
<L>The hardiest frame! Of indolence, of toil</L>
<L>We die; of want, of superfluity.</L>
<L>The all surrounding heav'n, the vital air,</L>

<P>Since then we are so liable to be dispossessed of this earthly tabernacle, let us look upon ourselves only as <HI>tenants at will</HI>; and hold ourselves in perpetual readi∣ness, to depart at a moment's warning. Without such an <HI>habitual</HI> readiness, we are like wretches, that sleep on the top of a mast, while a horrid gulph yawns, or furious waves rage, below. And where can be the peace, what the satisfaction, of such a state?—Whereas, a pre∣pared condition will inspire a cheerfulness of temper, not to be dismayed by any alarming accident; and create a firmness of mind, not to be overthrown by the most threatening dangers. When the city is fortified with walls, furnished with provision, guarded by able and res∣olute troops; what have the inhabitants to fear? what may they not enjoy? So, just so, or rather by a much surer band, are connected the <HI>real</HI> taste of life, and the <HI>constant</HI> thought of death.</P>
<P>I said, <HI>our very comforts may become killing.</HI>—And see the truth inscribed by the hand, sealed with the
<PB N="19" REF="021885_0042_0FB5F029B84A0CA8"/>
signet of fate. The marble, which graces yonder pillar, informs me, that, near it, are deposited the re∣mains of <HI>Sophronia</HI>; the much lamented <HI>Sophronia,</HI> who died in <HI>childbed.</HI>—How often does this calamity happen! The branch shoots; but the stem withers. The babe springs to light; but she that bare him, breathes her last. She gives life, but gives it (O pitiable considera∣tion!) at the expense of her own; and becomes, at once, a <HI>mother,</HI> and a <HI>corpse.</HI>—Or else, perhaps, she expires in severe pangs, and is herself a tomb for her infant; while the melancholy complaint of a monarch's woe, is the epitaph for them both; <HI>the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isa. xxxvii.3.</NOTE>—Less to be lamented, in my opinion, <HI>this</HI> misfortune than the <HI>other.</HI> Better, for the tender stranger, to be stopped in the porch; than to enter, only to converse with afflic∣tion. Better, to find a grave in the womb, than to be exposed on a hazardous world without the guardian of its infantile years, without the faithful guide of its youth.</P>
<P>This monument is distinguished by its finer mate∣rials, and more delicate appendages. It seems to have taken its model from an affluent hand; directed by a generous heart; which thought it could never do enough for the deceased.—It seems, also, to exhibit an <HI>emble∣matical</HI> picture of <HI>Sophronia</HI>'s person and accomplishments. Is her beauty, or, what is more than beauty, her white∣robed innocence, represented by the snowy <HI>colour?</HI> The <HI>surface,</HI> smoothly polished, like her amiable temper, and engaging manners. The <HI>whole</HI> adorned, in a well judg∣ed medium between extravagant pomp, and sordid negli∣gence; like her undissembled goodness, remote from the least ostentation, yet in all points exemplary.—But ah! how vain, were all these endearing charms! How vain, the lustre of thy sprightly eye! How vain, the bloom of thy bridal youth! How vain, the honours of thy su∣periour birth! How unable to secure the lovely possessor, from the <HI>savage violence</HI> of death!—How ineffectual, the universal esteem of thy acquaintance; the fond∣ness of thy transported husband; or even the spotless in∣tegrity
<PB N="20" REF="021885_0043_0FB5F02AF4EC2C08"/>
of thy character; to prolong thy span, or pro∣cure thee a short reprieve!—The concurrence of all these circumstances reminds me of those beautiful and tender lines—
<Q><L>How lov'd, how <HI>valu'd</HI> once, avails thee not;</L>
<L>To whom related, or by whom begot:</L>
<L>A heap of dust alone remains of thee:</L>
<L>'Tis all <HI>THOU</HI> art!—and all the <HI>PROUD</HI> shall be! <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>These verses are inscribed on a small, but elegant monument, lately erected in the great church at <HI>Northampton.</HI> Which, in the <HI>Hieroglyphical</HI> decorations, corresponds with the description intro∣duced above. In this circumstance particularly, that it is dedicated to the memory of an amiable woman, Mrs. ANNE STONHOUSE; the excellent wife of my worthy friend Dr. STONHOUSE. Who has seen all the powers of that healing art, to which I, and so many others have been <HI>greatly</HI> indebted, failing in their attempts to preserve a life <HI>dearer</HI> to him than his own.
<Q><LG>

In the midst of this tender distress, he has sought some kind of con∣solation, even from the sepulchral marble. By teaching it to speak, at once, his esteem for <HI>her memory</HI>; and his veneration for <HI>that re∣ligion,</HI> which she so eminently adorned. Nor could this be more sig∣nificantly done, than by summing up her character, in that concise, but comprehensive sentence, A SINCERE CHRISTIAN. <HI>Concise</HI> enough, to be the motto for a mourning ring; yet as <HI>comprehensive,</HI> as the most enlarged sphere of personal, social, and religious worth. For, whatsoever things are pure; whatsoever things are lovely; whatsoever things are of good report; are they not all included in that grand and noble aggregate, <HI>a sincere Christian?</HI></P>
<P>The first lines, considered in such a connexion, are wonderfully plaintive and pathetick—
<Q><L>How lov'd, how <HI>valu'd</HI> once, avails thee not;</L>
<L>To whom related, or by whom begot.</L></Q>
They sound, at least in <HI>my</HI> ears, like the voice of sorrow, mingled with admiration. The speaker seems to have been lost, for a while, in melancholy contemplation; suddenly breaks out into this abrupt encomium; then melts into tears, and can proceed no farther. Yet, in this case, how eloquent is silence! While it hints the univer∣sal esteem which attended, and the superiority of birth which dis∣tinguished, the deceased <HI>wife</HI>; it expresses, beyond all the pomp of words, the yearning affection, and heartfelt affliction of the surviving <HI>husband.</HI>—Amidst the group of monumental marbles, which are lavish of their panegyrick; <HI>this,</HI> I think, resembles the incomparable address of the painter—who, having placed, round a beautiful expiring virgin, her friends in all the agonies of grief; represented the <HI>unequalled</HI> anguish of the <HI>father,</HI> with far greater liveliness▪ and strength, or rather with an inexpressible emphasis, by drawing a veil over <HI>his</HI> face.</P>
<P>If the last lines, are a wide departure from the beaten track of our modern epitaphs, and the very reverse of their highflown com∣pliments—
<Q><L>A heap of dust alone remains of thee!</L>
<L>'Tis all <HI>THOU</HI> art!—and all the <HI>PROUD</HI> shall be!</L></Q>
they are not without a precedent, and one of the most consummate kind. Since they breathe the very spirit of that sacred elegy, in which all the heart of the hero and the friend, seems to be dissolved; <HI>How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!</HI> 2 Sam. i.27.—They remind the reader, of that awful lesson, which was originally dictated by the supreme wisdom—<HI>dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return,</HI> Gen. iii.19.—They inculcate, with all the force of the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> convincing evidence, that solemn admonition, de∣livered by the prophet—<HI>Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nos∣trils; for wherein is HE to be accounted of?</HI> Isa. ii.22.</P>
<P>That no reader, however inattentive, might mistake the sense and design of <HI>this</HI> part of the <HI>fourth</HI> line—
<Q>'Tis <HI>ALL</HI> thou art!—</Q>
it is guarded above and beneath.—<HI>Above,</HI> is an expanded book, that seems to be waved, with an air of triumph, over the emblem of death. Which we cannot but suppose to be the volume of inspira∣tion, as it exhibits a sort of <HI>abridgement</HI> of its whole contents, in those animated words; BE YE NOT SLOTHFUL, BUT FOLLOW∣ERS OF THEM, WHO THROUGH FAITH AND PATIENCE IN∣HERIT THE PROMISES, <HI>Heb.</HI> vi.12.—<HI>Beneath,</HI> that every part might be pregnant with instruction, are those striking reflections; worthy the consideration of the <HI>highest</HI> proficient in knowledge and piety, yet obvious to the understanding of the most <HI>untaught</HI> reader; LIFE, HOW SHORT; ETERNITY, HOW LONG!—May my soul learn the forcible purport of this short lesson, in her contracted span of time! and all eternity will not be too long, to rejoice in having learned it.</P></NOTE></L>

With a sickly appetite, we often lothe what is whole∣some, and hanker after our bane. Where <HI>imagination</HI> dreams of unmingled sweets; there, <HI>experience</HI> fre∣quently finds the bitterness of woe.</P>
<P>Therefore, may we covet immoderately, nei∣ther this nor that form of earthly felicity; but refer the whole of our condition, to the choice of unerring wis∣dom. May we learn to renounce our own will; and be ready to make a sacrifice of our warmest wishes, when∣ever they run counter to the good pleasure of GOD. For, indeed, as to obey his laws, is to be perfectly free; so, to <HI>resign</HI> ourselves to his disposal, is to <HI>establish</HI> our own happiness, and to be secure from fear of evil.</P>
<P>Here, a small and plain stone is placed upon the ground. Purchased, one would imagine, from the lit∣tle fund, and formed by the hand, of frugality itself. Nothing costly: Not one decoration added: Only a very short inscription; and that so effaced, as to be scarcely in∣telligible.—Was the depository unfaithful to its trust? Or were the letters worn by the frequent resort of the surviving family; to mourn over the grave of a most valuable and beloved relative?—For I perceive, upon a closer inspection, that it covers the remains of a father. A <HI>religious father</HI>; snatched from his growing offspring, before they were settled in the world, or so much as their principles fixed by a thorough education.</P>
<P>This, sure, is the most complicated distress, that has hitherto come under our consideration, The <HI>solem∣nities</HI> of such a <HI>dying chamber,</HI> are some of the most melting and melancholy scenes imaginable.—There lies the affectionate husband; the indulgent parent; the faithful friend; and the generous master. He lies in the last extremities, and on the very point of dissolution. Art has done its all. The raging discase mocks the power of medicine. It hastens, with resistless impetu∣osity, to execute its dreadful errand; to rend asunder the silver cord of life, and the more delicate tie of so∣cial attachment, and conjugal affection.</P>
<P>A <HI>servant</HI> or two, from a revering distance, cast many a wishful look, and condole their honoured master in the language of sighs. The condescending mildness of

The re∣membrance of both imbitters their grief, and makes it trickle plentifully down their honest cheeks.—His <HI>friends,</HI> who have so often shared his joys, and gladdened his mind with their enlivening converse, now are miserable com∣forters. A sympathizing and mournful pity, is all the relief, they are able to contribute; unless it be aug∣mented by their silent prayers for the divine succour, and a word of consolation suggested from the scriptures.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Texts of scripture, proper for such an occasion; containing promises—of support under affliction, <HI>Lam.</HI> iii.32. <HI>Heb.</HI> xii.6. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> iv.17.—of pardon, <HI>Isai.</HI> liii 5. <HI>Isai.</HI> i.18. 1 <HI>John</HI> ii.1, 2. <HI>Acts</HI> x.43.—of justification, <HI>Rom.</HI> v.9. <HI>Rom.</HI> viii.33, 34. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> v.21.—of victory over death, <HI>Psalm</HI> xxiii.4. <HI>Psalm</HI> lxxiii.26. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xv.56, 57.—of a happy resurrection, <HI>John</HI> vi.40. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> v.1. <HI>Rev.</HI> vii.16, 17.</NOTE> Those poor innocents, the <HI>children,</HI> crowd around the bed; drowned in tears, and almost frantick with grief, they sob out their little souls, and passionately cry;

<P>These separate streams are all united in the distressed <HI>spouse,</HI> and overwhelm her breast with an impetuous tide of sorrows. In her, the lover weeps; the wife mourns; and all the mother yearns. To her, the loss is beyond measure aggravated, by months and years of delightful society, and exalted friendship.—Where, a∣las! can she meet with such unsuspected fidelity, or re∣pose such unreserved confidence? Where find so discreet a counsellor; so improving an example; and a guardian so sedulously attentive, to the interests of herself, and her children?—See! how she hangs over the languish∣ing bed; most tenderly solicitous to prolong a life, important and desirable far beyond her own. Or, if that be impracticable, no less tenderly officious to sooth the last agonies of her <HI>dearer self.</HI>—Her hands, trembling under direful apprehensions, wipe the cold dews from the livid cheeks; and sometimes stay the sinking head on her gentle arms, and sometimes rest it on her compassionate bosom.—See! how she gazes, with a speechless ardour, on the pale countenance, and meagre features. Speechless

her tongue; but she looks unutterable things. While all her soft passions throb with unavailing fondness, and her very soul bleeds with exquisite anguish.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sufferer,</HI> all patient and adoring, submits to the divine will; and, by submission, becomes superiour to his affliction. He is sensibly touched with the disconsolate state of his attendants; and pierced with an anxious concern, for his wife and his children. His wife, who will soon be a <HI>destitute widow</HI>; his children, who will soon be <HI>helpless orphans.</HI>
<Q>Yet, though cast down, not in despair.</Q>
He is greatly refreshed by his trust in the everlasting covenant, and his hope of approaching glory. Religion gives a dignity to distress. At each interval of ease, he comforts his very comforters; and suffers with all the majesty of woe.</P>
<P>The soul, just going to abandon the tottering clay, collects all her force, and exerts her <HI>last</HI> efforts. The good man raises himself on his pillow; extends a kind hand to his servants, which is bathed in tears; takes an affecting farewel of his fri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ds; clasps his wife in a fee∣ble embrace; kisses the dear pledges of their mutual love; and then pours all that remains of life and of strength, in the following words;—
<Q>I die, <HI>my</HI> dear <HI>children;</HI> but GOD, the everlasting GOD, will be with you.—Though you lose an earthly parent; you have a father in heaven, who lives for evermore.—Nothing, nothing but an unbelieving heart, and irreligious life, can ever separate you, from the regards of his prov∣idence—from the endearments of his love.</Q></P>
<P>He could proceed no farther. His heart was full; but utterance failed. After a short pause, with difficulty, great difficulty, he added;—
<Q>You, the dear <HI>partner</HI> of my soul, you are now the only protector of our orphans.—I leave you under a weight of cares.—But GOD, who defendeth the cause of the widow—GOD, whose promise is faithfulness and truth—GOD hath said, <HI>I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb, xiii.5.</NOTE>—This revives my drooping spirits—let this support the wife of my bosom—and now, O father of compassions, into thy hands I commend my spirit—encouraged by thy promised goodness, <HI>I leave my fatherless</HI>—</Q></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="021885_0049_0FB5F04107F47020"/>Here, he fainted; fell back upon the bed; and lay, for some minutes, bereft of his senses. As a <HI>taper,</HI> upon the very point of extinction, is sometimes suddenly re∣kindled, and leaps into a quivering flame: So <HI>life,</HI> be∣fore it totally expired, gave a parting struggle, and once more looked abroad from the opening eyelids.—He would fain have spoke; fain have uttered the sentence, he began. More than once he assayed; but the organs of speech were become like a broken vessel; and nothing but the obstructing phlegm, rattled in his throat. His <HI>as∣pect,</HI> however <HI>spoke</HI> affection inexpressible. With all the father, all the husband still living in his looks; he takes one more view of those <HI>dear children,</HI> whom he had oft∣en beheld with a parental triumph. He turns his dy∣ing eyes on that <HI>beloved woman,</HI> whom he never beheld but with a glow of delight. Fixed in this posture, a∣midst smiles of love, and under a gleam of heaven, they shine out their last.</P>
<P>Upon this, the silent sorrow bursts into loud laments. They weep, and refuse to be comforted. Till some length of time, had given vent to the excess of pas∣sion; and the consolations of religion; had staunched their bleeding woes. Then, the afflicted family search for the sentence, which fell <HI>unfinished</HI> from those loved, those venerable, and pious lips. They find it recorded by the prophet <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> containing the direction of in∣finite wisdom, and the promise of unbounded goodness; <HI>Leave thy fatherless children; I will preserve them alive; and let thy widows trust in me.</HI><NOTE PLACE="foot">Jerem. xlix.11.</NOTE> This, now, is the com∣fort of their life, and the joy of their heart. They treasure it up in their memories. It is the best of <HI>lega∣cies,</HI> and an <HI>inexhaustible</HI> fund. A fund, which will sup∣ply all their wants, by entailing the blessing of heaven, on all their honest labours.—They are rich, they are happy, in this sacred pledge of the divine favour.

<P>This is the season, which stands in need of <HI>comfort</HI>; and is very improper to enter upon the <HI>conflict.</HI> The husbandman should now be putting in his sickle, or eat∣ing the fruit of his labours; not beginning to break up the ground, or scatter the seed.—Nothing, it is true, is impossible with GOD; He said, <HI>Let there be light, and there was light:</HI> Instantaneous light, diffused, as quick as thought, through all the dismal dominion of prime∣val darkness.

knowledge, and saving faith; treasures of atoning blood, and imputed righteousness.</P>
<P>Here <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Some, I know, are offended at our burying corpses within the church; and exclaim against it, as a very great <HI>impropriety</HI> and <HI>inde∣cency.</HI> But this, I imagine, proceeds from an excessive and mistaken delicacy. If proper care be taken to secure from injury, the <HI>foun∣dations</HI> of the <HI>building</HI>; and to prevent the exhalation of any <HI>noxious effluvia,</HI> from the putrefying flesh; I cannot discover any inconve∣niences, attending this practice.</P>
<P>The notion, that noisome carcasses (as they are called) are very unbecoming a place consecrated to religious purposes, seems to be de∣rived from the <HI>antiquated Jewish</HI> canon. Whereby it was declared, that a dead body imparted defilement to the person who touched it; and polluted the spot, where it was lodged. On which account, the <HI>Jews</HI> were scrupulously careful, to have their sepulchres built at a distance from their houses; and made it a point of conscience, not to suffer burial places to subsist in the city. But as this was a rite purely <HI>ceremonial</HI>; it seems to be entirely superseded by the <HI>gospel</HI> dis∣pensation.</P>
<P>I cannot forbear thinking, that, under the christian economy, there is a propriety and usefulness in the custom.—<HI>Usefulness,</HI> be∣cause it must render our solemn assemblies more venerable and awful. For when we walk over the dust of our friends, or kneel upon the ashes of our relations; this awakening circumstance must strike a lively impression of our own mortality. And what consideration can be more effectual, to make us serious and attentive in hearing; earnest and importunate in praying?</P>
<P>As for the <HI>fitness</HI> of the usage, it seems perfectly suitable to the design of those sacred edifices. They are set apart for GOD; not only to receive his worshippers, but to preserve the furniture for holy ministrations, and what is, in a peculiar manner, appropriated to the divine majesty. Are not the bodies of the saints the Almighty's property? Were they not once the objects of his <HI>tender love?</HI> Are they not still the subjects of his <HI>special care?</HI> Has he not given com∣mandment concerning the bones of his elect; and charged the ocean, and enjoined the grave, to keep them until <HI>that day?</HI> When rocks bright with <HI>gems,</HI> or mountains rich with <HI>mines,</HI> are ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndoned to the devouring flames; will not <HI>these</HI> be rescued from the fiery ruin? Will not <HI>these</HI> be translated into JEHOVAH's kingdom, and, conjointly with the soul, made "his jewels;" made "his peculiar treasure;" made to shine as the brightness of the firmament, and as the stars for ever and ever?</P>
<P>Is not CHRIST <HI>the LORD of our bodies?</HI> Are they not bought with a price? bought, not with corruptible things, silver and gold, but with his divinely precious blood. And, if the blessed JESUS ob∣tained the redemption of our bodies, at so infinitely dear a rate; can it enter into our hearts to conceive, that he should dislike to have them reposed, under his own habitation?—Once more; are not the bodies of the faithful <HI>temples of the Holy Ghost?</HI> And is there not upon this supposition, an apparent <HI>propriety,</HI> rather than the least <HI>in∣decorum,</HI> in remitting these temples of flesh to the temples made with hands? They are vessels of honour; instruments of righteous∣ness; and, even when broken by death, like the fragments of a golden bowl, are valuable; are worthy to be laid up in the safest, most honourable repositories.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, since the LORD JESUS has purchased them, at the expense of his blood; and the blessed spirit has honoured them, with his indwelling presence: since they are right dear in the sight of the adorable Trinity, and undoubted heirs of a glorious immor∣tality, why should it be thought a thing improper, to admit them to a transient rest, in their heavenly father's house? Why may they not lie down and sleep in the <HI>outer courts,</HI> since they are soon to be introduced, into the <HI>inmost mansions</HI> of everlasting honour and joy?</P></NOTE> lie their bodies in
<Q>peaceable habitations, and quiet resting places.</Q>
Here, they have thrown off every <HI>burden,</HI> and are escaped from every <HI>snare.</HI> The head aches no more; the eye forgets to weep; the flesh
<PB N="33" REF="021885_0056_0FB5F057730DE688"/>
is no longer racked with acute, nor wasted with lingering distempers. Here, they receive a final release from pain, and an everlasting discharge from sorrow. Here, dan∣ger never threatens them with her terrifying alarms; but <HI>tranquillity</HI> softens their couch, and <HI>safety</HI> guards their repose.—Rest then, ye precious relicks, within this hos∣pitable gloom.

<P>To these, how <HI>calm</HI> was the <HI>evening</HI> of life! In what a smiling serenity, did their sun go down! when their flesh and their heart failed, how reviving was the remembrance of an all sufficient redeemer; once dying for <HI>their</HI> sins, now risen again for <HI>their</HI> justifica∣tion! How cheering the well grounded hope of pardon for their transgressions, and peace with GOD, through JESUS CHRIST our LORD! How did this <HI>asswage</HI> the agonies, and <HI>sweeten</HI> the bitterness of death?—Where now is wealth, with all her golden mountains? Where is honour, with her proud trophies of renown? Where are all the vain pomps of a deluded world? Can they

<P>And now they are gone.—The struggles of reluctant nature are over. The body sleeps in death: The soul launches into the invisible state.—But, who can imagine the delightful surprise, when they find themselves sur∣rounded by <HI>guardian angels,</HI> instead of <HI>weeping friends?</HI> How securely do they wing their way, and pass through unknown worlds, under the conduct of those celestial guides!—The vale of tears is quite lost.

<P>Here, then, let us leave the spirits and souls of the righteous; escaped from an entangling <HI>wilderness,</HI> and re∣ceived into a <HI>paradise</HI> of delights!

That prince of heaven resigned his royal person, not barely to the hazard, but to the inevitable stroke; to death, certain in its approach, and armed with all its hor∣rours.—And for <HI>whom?</HI> Not for those who were in any degree deserving, but for his own <HI>disobedient creatures</HI>; for the pardon of condemned malefactors; for a band of rebels, a race of traitors, the most obnoxious and in∣excusable of all criminals.

<P>The one, 'tis probable, died <HI>expeditiously</HI>; was sud∣denly wounded, and soon slain.

<P>Yonder entrance leads, I suppose, to the <HI>Vault.</HI> Let me turn aside and take one view of the habita∣tion, and its tenants.—The sullen <HI>door</HI> grates upon its hinges: Not used to receive many visitants, it admits me with reluctance and murmurs.—What meaneth this <HI>sudden trepidation,</HI> while I descend the steps, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> visiting the pale nations of the dead?—Be composed, my spirits, there is nothing to fear in these quiet chambers.
<Q>Here, even the wicked cease from troub∣ling.</Q></P>
<P>Good heavens! what a solemn scene!—How dismal the <HI>gloom!</HI> Here is perpetual darkness, and night even at noonday.—How doleful the <HI>solitude!</HI> Not one trace of cheerful society; but sorrow and terrour seem to have made this their dreaded abode.—Hark! how the hollow dome resounds at every tread. The <HI>echoes,</HI> that long have slept are awakened, and lament, and sigh, along the walls.</P>
<P>A beam or two, finds its way through the grates, and reflects a feeble glimmer, from the nails of the
<PB N="41" REF="021885_0064_0FB5F06F6DD978F8"/>
<HI>coffins.</HI> So many of those sad spectacles, half concealed in shades, half seen dimly by the baleful twilight, add a deeper horrour to these gloomy mansions.—I pore upon the inscriptions and am just able to pick out, that these are the remains of the rich and renowned. No vulgar dead are deposited here. The <HI>Most Illustrious,</HI> and <HI>Right Honourable</HI> have claimed this for their last retreat. And, indeed, they retain somewhat of a shadowy preeminence. They lie ranged in a mournful order, and in a sort of a silent pomp under the arches of an ample sepulchre: While meaner corpses, without much ceremony,
<Q>go down to the stones of the pit.</Q></P>
<P>My apprehensions recover from their surprise. I find here are no phantoms, but such as fear raises.— However, it still amazes me to observe the wonders of this nether world. Those who received vast revenues and called whole lordships their own, are here reduced to half a dozen feet of earth, or confined in a few <HI>sheets</HI> of <HI>lead.</HI> Rooms of state, and sumptuous furni∣ture are resigned, for no other ornament than the <HI>shroud,</HI> for no other apartment than the darksome <HI>niche.</HI> —Where is the star, that blazed upon the breast; or coronet that glittered round the temples? The only remains of departed dignity are, the weatherbeaten hatchment and the tattered escutcheon. I see no splen∣did retinue, surrounding this solitary dwelling. The lordly equipage hovers no longer about the lifeless mas∣ter. He has no other attendant than a dusty <HI>statue,</HI> which, while the regardless world is as gay as ever, the sculptor's hand has taught to weep.</P>
<P>Those who gloried in high born ancestors, and <HI>noble pedigree,</HI> here drop their lofty pretensions. They acknowledge kindred with creeping things, and <HI>quarter arms</HI> with the meanest reptiles. <HI>They say to corruption, thou art my father; and to the worm, thou art my moth∣er and my sister.</HI>—Or, should they still assume the stile of distinction, ah! how impotent were the claim! how apparent the ostentation! Is it said by their monument? HERE LIES THE GREAT. How easily is it replied by the spectator!
<Q><L>—False marble! where?</L>
<L>Nothing but poor and sordid dust lies here.</L></Q>

Mortifying truth! Sufficient, one would think, to wean the most sanguine appetite, from this transitory state of things; from its sickly satisfactions, its fading glories, its vanishing treasures.</P>
<Q><L>For now, ye <HI>living vanities</HI> of life!</L>

<L>Where are ye NOW? And what is your amount?</L></Q>
<P>What is all the world to these poor breathless be∣ings?—What are their <HI>pleasures?</HI> A bubble broke.— What their <HI>honours?</HI> A dream that is forgotten.—What the sum total of their <HI>enjoyments</HI> below? Once, perhaps, it appeared to inexperienced and fond desire, something considerable. But, now death has measured it with his line, and weighed it in his scale, what is the upshot? Alas! it is shorter than a span, lighter than the dancing spark, and driven away like the dissolving smoke.</P>
<P>Indulge, my soul, a serious pause. Recollect all the <HI>gay things,</HI> that were wont to dazzle thy eyes and inveigle thy affections. Here examine those baits of sense. Here form an estimate of their <HI>real value.</HI> Sup∣pose thyself first among the favourites of fortune, who revel in the lap of pleasure; who shine in the robes of honour; and swim in tides of inexhausted riches. Yet, how soon would the passing bell proclaim thy exit! And, when once that iron call has summoned thee to thy fu∣ture reckoning; where would all these gratifications be? At that period, how will all the pageantry of the most affluent, splendid, or luxurious circumstances, vanish into empty air!—And is <HI>this</HI> a happiness so passionately, to be coveted?</P>
<P>I Thank you, ye relicks of sounding titles and magnificent names. Ye have taught me more of the littleness of the world than all the volumes of my library. Your nobility arrayed in a winding sheet; your grandeur mouldering in an urn; are the most in∣disputable proofs of the <HI>nothingness</HI> of created things. Never, surely, did Providence write this important point in such legible characters, as in the ashes of <HI>my Lord,</HI> or on the corpse of <HI>his Grace.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><L>—Mors sola fatetur</L>

My thoughts shall often resort, in pensive contemplation, to the sepulchres of their sires, and learn from their sleeping dust—to <HI>moderate</HI> my expectations from mor∣tals—to stand <HI>disengaged</HI> from every undue attachment to the little interests of time—to get above the delusive, amusements of honour; the gaudy tinsels of wealth; and all the empty shadows of a perishing world.</P>
<P>Hark! what <HI>sound</HI> is that!—In such a situation, every noise alarms.—Solemn and slow, it breaks again upon the silent air.—'Tis the striking of the clock, designed, one would imagine, to ratify all my serious meditations. Methinks it says <HI>Amen,</HI> and sets a seal to every improving hint. It tells me that another portion of my appointed time is elapsed. One calls it, "the knell of my departed hours." 'Tis the watch∣word to vigilance and activity. It cries in the ear of reason,
<Q>Redeem the time. Catch the favour∣able <HI>gales</HI> of <HI>opportunity:</HI> O! catch them, while they breathe; before they are irrecoverably lost. The span of life shortens continually.

<P>I have often walked beneath the impending prom∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntory's craggy cliff; I have sometimes trod the vast spaces of the lonely desert, and penetrated the inmost recesses of the dreary cavern; but never, never beheld nature louring with so <HI>tremendous</HI> a form; never felt such impressions of <HI>awe,</HI> striking cold on my heart, as under these black browed arches, amidst these mouldy walls, and surrounded by such rueful objects.

and shades of death! Gladly I revisit the realms of day.</P>
<P>Having cast a <HI>superficial</HI> view, upon these recepta∣cles of the dead; curiosity prompts my inquiry to a more <HI>intimate</HI> survey. Could we draw back the covering of the tomb; could we discern what those are now, who once were mortals—O! how would it surprise, and grieve us; <HI>surprise</HI> us, to behold the prodigious transforma∣tion, which has taken place on every individual; <HI>grieve</HI> us, to observe the dishonour done to our nature in gen∣eral, within these subterraneous lodgments!</P>
<P>Here, the sweet and winning <HI>aspect,</HI> that wore per∣petually an attractive smile, grins horridly a naked, ghastly skull. The <HI>eye,</HI> that outshone the diamond's brilliancy, and glanced its lovely lightning into the most guarded heart: Alas! where is it? Where shall we find the rolling sparkler? How are all its sprightly beams eclipsed! totally eclipsed! The <HI>tongue,</HI> that once commanded all the power of eloquence, in this strange land has "forgot its cunning." Where are now those strains of harmony which ravished our ears? Where is that flow of persuasion which carried captive our judg∣ments. The great master of language and of song, is become silent as the night that surrounds him. The pampered <HI>flesh,</HI> so lately clothed in purple and fine linen, how is it covered rudely with clods of clay! There was a time when the timorously nice creature would scarce

but is now enwrap∣ped in clammy earth, and sleeps on no softer a pillow than the ragged gravel stones. Here
<Q>the <HI>strong men</HI> bow themselves.</Q>
The nervous arm is unstrung; the brawny sinews are relaxed; the limbs, not long ago the seats of vigour and activity, lie down motionless; and the bones, which were as bars of iron, are crum∣bled into dust.</P>
<P>Here the <HI>man</HI> of <HI>business</HI> forgets all his favourite schemes, and discontinues the pursuit of gain. Here is a total stand to the circulation of merchandise, and
<PB N="45" REF="021885_0068_0FB5F07E2A534808"/>
the hurry of trade. In these solitary recesses, as in the building of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s temple, is heard no sound of the hammer and axe. The winding sheet and the coffin, are the utmost bound of all earthly devices.
<Q>Hitherto may they go, but no farther.</Q>
—Here the <HI>sons</HI> of <HI>Pleas∣ure</HI> take a final farewel of their dear delights. No more is the sensualist; anointed with oil, or crowned with rose buds. He chants no more to the melody of the viol, nor revels any longer at the banquet of wine.

<P>Could the <HI>lover</HI> have a sight of his once enchanting fair one, what a startling astonishment would seize him! —
<Q>Is this the object I not long ago so passionately ad∣mired! I said she was divinely fair, and thought her somewhat more than mortal.

<P>Lie, poor <HI>Florella!</HI> lie deep, as thou dost, in obscure darkness. Let night, with her impenetrable shades, always conceal thee. May no prying eye be witness to thy disgrace; but let thy <HI>surviving sisters</HI> think upon thy state, when they contemplate the idol in the glass.— When the pleasing image rises gracefully to view, sur∣rounded with a world of charms, and flushed with joy at the consciousness of them all—Then, in those minutes of temptation and danger, when vanity uses to steal into the thoughts—Then let them remember, what a <HI>veil</HI> of <HI>horrour</HI> is drawn over a face which was once beautiful and brilliant as theirs. Such a seasonable re∣flection might regulate the labours of the toilet, and create a more earnest solicitude to polish the <HI>jewel</HI> than to varnish the <HI>casket.</HI> It might then become their highest ambition to have their mind decked with divine virtues, and dressed after the amiable pattern of their Redeemer's holiness.</P>
<P>And would this prejudice their persons, or depreciate their charms?—Quite the reverse. It would spread a sort of heavenly glory over the finest <HI>set of features,</HI> and heighten the loveliness of every other engaging accom∣plishment.—What is yet a more inviting consideration, these flowers would not wither with nature, nor be tar∣nished by time; but would open continually into richer beauties, and <HI>flourish</HI> even in the <HI>winter</HI> of age.—But, the most incomparable recommendation of these noble qualities, is, That, from their hallowed relicks, as from the fragrant ashes of the <HI>Phoenix,</HI> will ere long arise an illustrious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orm, bright as the wings of angels, lasting as the light of the new <HI>Jerusalem.</HI></P>
<P>For my part, the remembrance of this sad revolution shall make me <HI>ashamed</HI> to pay my devotion to a shrine of perishing flesh; and <HI>afraid</HI> to expect all my happi∣ness from so brittle a joy. It shall teach me not to think too highly of well proportioned clay, though formed in the most elegant mould, and animated with the sweetest soul.

<PB N="47" REF="021885_0070_0FB5F08BD0D1E880"/>
with <HI>love,</HI> as a most valuable blessing, not worshipped with the incense of flattery, and strains of fulsome ad∣oration, as a goddess.—It will cure, I trust, the <HI>dot∣age</HI> of my <HI>eyes,</HI> and incline me always to prefer the substantial "ornaments of a meek and virtuous spirit," before the transient decorations of white and red on the skin.</P>
<P>Here I called in my roving medi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tions from their long excursion on this tender subject. Fancy listened a while to the soliloquy of a lover. Now judgment re∣sumes the reins and guides my thoughts to more near and self interesting inquiries.—However, upon a review of the whole scene, crowded with <HI>spectacles</HI> of <HI>mortality,</HI> and <HI>trophies</HI> of <HI>death,</HI> I could not forbear smiting my breast, and fetching a sigh, and lamenting over the no∣blest of all visible beings, laid prostrate under the feet of "the pale horse, and his rider."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. vi.8.</NOTE> I could not for∣bear repeating that pathetick exclamation—"<HI>Oh! thou</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Esdr. vii.41.</NOTE><HI>Adam, what hast thou done!</HI>" What desolation has thy disobedience wrought in the earth!—See the malig∣nity, the ruinous malignity of <HI>sin</HI>! Sin has demolish∣ed so many stately structures of flesh: Sin has made such havock among the most excellent ranks of GOD's lower creation: And sin (that deadly bane of our na∣ture) would have plunged our better part into the exe∣crable horrours of the nethermost hell, had not our merciful Mediator interposed, and given himself for our ransom. Therefore what grateful acknowledgments does the whole world of <HI>penitent</HI> sinners owe; what ardent returns of love will a whole heaven of <HI>glorified</HI> believers pay, to such a friend, benefactor, and deliv∣erer!</P>
<P>Musing upon these melancholy objects, a faithful re∣membrancer suggests from within—

Nothing is more certain. A decree much surer than the laws of the <HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>Persians,</HI> has irrevocably determined the doom.</P>
<P>Should one of these ghastly figures burst from his confinement, and start up, in frightful deformity, before me—should the <HI>haggard skeleton</HI> lift a clattering hand, and point it full in my view—should it open the stif∣fened jaws, and, with a hoarse tremendous murmur, break this profound silence—should it accost <HI>me,</HI> as <HI>Samuel</HI>'s apparition addressed the trembling king—

Yet, there is abun∣dantly greater reason to be alarmed, by that express decla∣ration of the LORD GOD Almighty, "<HI>Thou shalt sure∣ly die.</HI>"—Well then, since sentence is passed, since I am a condemned man; and know not when the dead warrant may arrive, let me die to <HI>sin,</HI> and die to the <HI>world,</HI> before I die beneath the stroke of a right∣eous GOD. Let me employ the little uncertain interval of respite from execution, in preparing for a happier state, and a better life.

here below, I may open them again, to see my Saviour in the mansions above.</P>
<P>Since this body, which is so fearfully and wonder∣fully made, must fall to pieces in the grave; since I must soon resign all my bodily powers to darkness, inactivity, and corruption, let it be my constant care to use them well, while I possess them!—Let my <HI>hands</HI> be stretched forth to relieve the needy; and always be more
<Q>ready to give than to receive.</Q>
—Let my <HI>knees</HI> bend in deep∣est humiliation, before the throne of grace; while my <HI>eyes</HI> are cast down to the earth in penitential confusion, or devoutly looking up to heaven for pardoning mer∣cy!—In every friendly interview, let the
<Q>law of kind∣ness dwell on my <HI>lips</HI>;</Q>
or rather, if the seriousness of my acquaintance permits, let the Gospel of peace flow from my tongue. O! that I might be enabled, in every publick concourse, to lift up my voice like a trum∣pet, and pour abroad a more joyful sound than its most melodious accents, in proclaiming the glad tidings of free salvation!—But shut my <HI>ears,</HI> resolutely shut, a∣gainst the malevolent whispers of slander, and the con∣tagious breath of filthy talking. But be swift to hear the instructions of wisdom; be all attention when your Redeemer speaks; imbibe the precious truths, and con∣vey them carefully to the heart.—Carry me, my <HI>feet,</HI> to the temple of the LORD, to the beds of the sick, and houses of the poor. May all my members, devoted en∣tirely to my divine Master, be the willing instruments of promoting his glory!</P>
<P>Then, ye embalmers, you may spare your pains. These works of faith and labours of love; these shall be my <HI>spices</HI> and <HI>perfumes.</HI> Enwrapped in these, I would lay me gently down, and sleep sweetly in the blessed JE∣SUS, hoping that GOD will

<P>Resurrection! That cheering word eases my mind of an anxious thought, and solves a most momentous question. I was going to ask;

But, with how much greater demonstrations of kindness, are they <HI>both</HI> re∣ceived, by their compassionate Redeemer! The ancient of days, who comes in the clouds of heaven, is their friend, their father, their bridegroom.

<P>Hark! the thunders are hushed. See! the light∣nings cease their rage. The angelick armies stand in silent suspense. The whole race of <HI>Adam,</HI> is wrapped up in pleasing, or anxious expectation.—And now, that adorable person, whose favour is better than life; whose acceptance is a crown of glory; lifts up the light of his countenance upon the righteous. He speaks, and what ravishing words proceed from his gracious lips! What ecstasies of delight they enkindle in the breasts of the faithful!—
<Q>I accept you, O my people! Ye are they, that believed in my name. Ye are they, that renounced <HI>yourselves,</HI> and <HI>are complete in me.</HI> I see no spot or blemish in you; for ye are washed in my blood, and clothed with my righteousness.

<P>What a pleasing, yet awful thought is this! Full of delight, and full of dread. O! may it alarm our <HI>fears,</HI> quicken our <HI>hopes,</HI> and animate all our <HI>endeav∣ours</HI>!

The fatal sentence, once passed, is never to be repealed. No hope of exchanging their doleful habitations. But all things bear the same dismal aspect forever and ever.</P>
<P>The <HI>wicked</HI>—My mind recoils,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><L>—Animus meminisse borret, luctuque refugit.</L>

It has studiously waved the fearful subject, and seems unwilling to pursue it, even now.— But 'tis better to reflect upon it for a few minutes, than to endure it to eternal ages. Perhaps, the considera∣tion of their aggravated misery, may be <HI>profitably terri∣ble</HI>; may teach me more highly to prize the Saviour, who "delivers from going down into the bottomless pit;" may drive me like the avenger's sword, to this only city of refuge, for obnoxious sinners.</P>
<P>The wicked seem to lie here like malefactors, in a deep and strong dungeon, reserved against the day of trial.—"<HI>Their departure</HI> was without peace." Clouds of horrour sat louring upon their closing eyelids; most sadly foreboding the "blackness of darkness forever." When the last sickness seized their frame, and the in∣evitable

What horrible dread overwhelmed them! How did they stand shuddering and aghast, upon the tremen∣dous precipice! Excessively afraid to plunge into the abyss of eternity, yet utterly unable to maintain their standing on the verge of life.</P>
<P>O! what pale reviews, what startling prospects, conspire to augment their sorrows!—They look <HI>backward,</HI> and behold a most melancholy scene! Sins unrepented of; mercy slighted; and the day of grace ending!— They look <HI>forward,</HI> and nothing presents itself, but the righteous judge; the dreadful tribunal; and a most sol∣emn reckoning.—They roll <HI>around</HI> their affrighted eyes, on attending friends. If accomplices in debauchery; it sharpens their anguish, to consider this farther aggra∣vation of their guilt; that they have not sinned alone, but drawn others into the snare. If religious acquaint∣ance; it strikes a fresh gash into their hearts, to think of never seeing them any more, but only at an unap∣proachable distance, separated by the unpassable gulf.</P>
<P>At last, perhaps, they begin to <HI>pray.</HI> Finding no other possible way of relief, they are constrained to ap∣ply unto the Almighty. With trembling lips, and a faltering tongue, they cry unto that sovereign Being, "who kills and makes alive."—But why have they <HI>de∣ferred,</HI> so long deferred their addresses to GOD? Why have they <HI>despised</HI> all his counsels; and stood incorrigible under his incessant reproofs? How often have they been forewarned of these terrours; and most importunately intreated, to <HI>seek the LORD, while he might be found?</HI>— I wish, they may obtain mercy at the eleventh, at the last hour. I wish they may be snatched from the jaws, the opened, the gaping, the almost closing jaws of dam∣nation But, alas! Who can tell, whether affronted majesty, will lend an ear to their complaint? Whether the holy One will work a miracle of grace, in behalf of such transgressors? He may, for aught any mortal knows,
<Q>laugh at their calamity, and mock when their fear cometh.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="021885_0080_0FB5F0AB0A1033D0"/>Thus they lie, groaning out the poor remains of life; their limbs bathed in sweat; their heart strug∣gling with convulsive throes; pains unsupportable throb∣bing in every pulse; and innumerable darts of agony transfixing their consicience.</P>

Then GOD, the GOD to whom vengeance belongeth, will draw the arrow to the very head, and set them as the mark of his inexorable displeasure.</P>
<P>Resurection will be no privilege to them; but im∣mortality itself, their everlasting curse.—Would they not bless the grave,
<Q>that land where all things are for∣gotten;</Q>
and wish to lie eternally hid, in its deepest gloom? But the dust refuses to <HI>conceal</HI> their persons; or to draw a <HI>veil</HI> over their practices. They also must awake; must arise; must appear at the bar; and meet the judge. A judge, before whom

A Judge, once long suffering and very compassionate; but now un∣alterably determined, to teach stubborn offenders—What it is to <HI>provoke</HI> the omnipotent Godhead; what it is to <HI>trample</HI> upon the blood of his son: And offer <HI>despite</HI> to all the gracious overtures of his spirit.</P>
<P>O! the perplexity! the distraction! that must seize the impenitent rebels, when they are summoned to the great tribunal!—What will they do, in this day of se∣vere visitation? This day of final decision?—Where? How? Whence, can they find help?—To which of the saints will they turn? Whither betake themselves for shel∣ter or for succour?—Alas! 'tis all in vain, 'tis all too late. —Friends and acquaintance know them no more. Men and angels abandon them to their approaching doom.

<P>Behold! the books are opened. The secrets of all

How empty, how ineffectual <HI>now,</HI> are all those refined <HI>artifices</HI>; with which hypocrites im∣posed upon their fellow creatures, and preserved a char∣acter in the sight of men!—The jealous GOD, who has been about their path, and about their bed, and espied out all their ways, sets before them the things that they have done.

<P>What were all the realms of the world, but a <HI>dun∣geon</HI> of <HI>darkness,</HI> without the beams of the sun? All their fine scenes, hid from our view; lost in obscuri∣ty. —In vain, we roll around our eyes, in the midnight gloom. In vain, we strive to behold the features of ami∣able nature. Turn whether we will, no form or come∣liness appears. All seems a dreary waste; an undistin∣guished chaos. Till the returning hours, have unbarred the gates of light, and let forth the morn.—Then, what a prospect opens! The heavens are paved with azure, and strewed with roses. A variety of the liveli∣est verdures array the plains. The flowers put on a glow of the richest colours. The whole creation stands forth, dressed in all the charms of beauty.

<P>And what had been the condition of our intellectual nature, without the great redeemer, and his <HI>divine rev∣elation?</HI> —Alas! what absurd and unworthy apprehen∣sions, did the <HI>Pagan</HI> sages form of GOD!

to obtain peace and reconciliation with their offend∣ed JEHOVAH! Till JESUS arose upon our benighted minds and brought life and immortality to light; till HE arose, <HI>to enlighten the wretched Gentiles, and to be the glory of his people Israel.</HI></P>
<P>Now we no longer cry out, with a restless impatience, <HI>where is GOD my maker?</HI> For we are allowed to con∣template the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, <HI>in the face of JESUS CHRIST.</HI>— Now, we no longer inquire, with an unsatisfied solici∣tude, "which is the way to bliss?" Because JESUS has marked the <HI>path,</HI> by his shining example; and left us an unerring <HI>clue,</HI> in his holy word.—Now we have no more reason to proceed with misgiving hearts, in our journey to eternity; or to ask anxiously, as we go;
<Q>who will roll away the stone and open the everlasting doors? Who will remove the flaming sword, and give us ad∣mission into the delights of paradise?</Q>
For it is done, all done, by the captain of our salvation. Sin he has <HI>ex∣piated,</HI> by the unblemished sacrifice of himself. The law he has <HI>fulfilled,</HI> by his perfect obedience. The sinner he <HI>transforms,</HI> by his sanctifying SPIRIT.—In a word; he hath both presented us with a <HI>clear discovery</HI> of good things to come; and administered to us an <HI>abundant en∣trance,</HI> into the final enjoyment of them.</P>
<P>Whenever, therefore, we bless GOD for the circling seasons, and revolving day; let us adore, thankfully adore him, for the <HI>more precious</HI> appearance of the sun of righteousness, and his glorious gospel. Without which, we should have been groping, even to this hour, in spir∣itual darkness, and the shadow of death. Without which, we must have wandered in a maze of inextricable uncertainties; and have

It penetrates the beds of metal, and finds its way to the place of the sapphires. It tinctures the seeds of gold, that are ripening into ore; and throws a brilliancy into the water of the diamond, that is hardening on its rock.—In short; the beneficial agency of this magnificent luminary, is inexpressible. It <HI>beautifies</HI> and <HI>impregnates,</HI> universal nature.
<Q>There is nothing hid from the heat thereof.</Q></P>
<P>Just in the same manner, were the rational world <HI>dead in trespasses and sins,</HI> without the reviving energy of JESUS CHRIST. He is the "resurrection and the life:" The overflowing fountain of the one, and the all pow∣erful cause of the other. The second <HI>Adam</HI> is a <HI>quicken∣ing spirit,</HI> and all his saints live through him. He shines upon their affections; and they shoot forth into heavenly graces, and abound in the fruits of righteousness. Faith unfeigned, and love undissembled, those noblest pro∣ductions of the renewed nature, are the effect of <HI>his</HI> operation on the mind.

insects awake into existence, and bask in his rays. The birds start from their slumbers, and pour their de∣lighted souls in harmony. The flocks, with bleating ac∣cents hail the welcome blessing. The herds in lowing mur∣murs express their hoarser acclamations. The valleys ring with rural musick; the hills echo back the artless strains. All that is vocal, joins in the general choir; all that has breath exults in the cheering influence.—Whereas, was that radiant orb extinguished, a tremendous gloom would ensue, and horrour insupportable. Nay, let it only be <HI>eclipsed,</HI> for a few minutes, and all nature assumes an air of <HI>sadness.</HI> The heavens are wrapt in sables, and put on a kind of mourning.

Our GOD seems to be a consuming fire, and our sins cry loudly for ven∣geance. The thoughts bleed inwardly; the christian walks heavily.

But what a sovereign restorative, are these <HI>cooling distillations</HI> of the night! How they gladden, and invig∣orate the languishing herbs! Sprinkled with these re∣viving drops, their verdure deepens; their bloom is new flushed; their fragrance, faint or intermitted, becomes potent and copious.—Thus does the ever blessed SPIRIT <HI>revive</HI> the drooping troubled conscience of a sinner. When that almighty comforter sheds his sweet influence on the soul; displays the all sufficient sacrifice of a di∣vine Redeemer, and "witnesses with our spirit," that we are <HI>interested</HI> in the Saviour, and, by this means, are <HI>children of GOD</HI>; then, what a pleasing change ensues! Former anxieties are remembered no more. Every un∣easy apprehension vanishes. Soothing hopes, and delight∣ful expectations succeed. The countenance drops its dejected mein; the eyes brighten with a lively cheerful∣ness; while the lips express the heart felt satisfaction, in the language of thanksgiving, and the voice of mel∣ody.—In this sense, merciful GOD, <HI>be as the dew unto Israel!</HI>
<Q>Pour upon them the continual dew of thy bless∣ing.</Q>
And O! let not my fleece be dry, while heav∣enly benediction descends upon all around.</P>
<P>Who can number these pearly drops? They hang on every hedge; they twinkle from every spray; and adorn the whole herbage of the field. Not a blade of grass, not a single leaf, but wears the watry pendants. So <HI>vast</HI> is the <HI>profusion,</HI> that it baffles the arithmetician's art.— Here, let the benevolent mind contemplate and admire that emphatical scripture; which, from this elegant si∣militude, describes the <HI>increase</HI> of the <HI>Messiah</HI>'s kingdom. The royal prophet, speaking of CHRIST, and foretell∣ing the success of his religion, has this remarkable ex∣pression;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Psalm</HI> cx.3. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. The most exact translation of this difficult passage is, I apprehend, as follows; <HI>Prae rore uteri aurorae, tibi est rosjuventutis vel prolis tuae.</HI> The dew of thy birth is larger, more copious, than the dew which proceeds from the womb of the morning.—I cannot acquiesce in the new version; be∣cause that disjoins <HI>the womb of the morning,</HI> from <HI>the dew of thy birth.</HI> Whereas, they seem to have a clear affinity, and a close con∣nexion. The womb of the morning is, with the utmost pertinen∣cy, applied to the conception and production of dews; agreeably to a delicate line, in that great master of just description, and lively painting, Mr. <HI>Themson</HI>:
<Q><P>The meek ey'd morn appears, mother of dews.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Summer.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P>We meet with a fine expression in the book of <HI>Job,</HI> which may serve to confirm this remark; may illustrate the propriety of the phrase, used in this connexion.
<Q>Hath the rain a father, or who hath <HI>begotten the drops of dew?</HI></Q>
It seems, the oriental writers delighted to represent the dew, as a kind of birth, at the offspring of the morning. And if so, surely there could be no image in the whole compass of the universe, better adapted to the psalmist's purpose; or more strongly significant of those multitudes of proselytes, which were <HI>born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of GOD</HI>; by the powerful energy of his word and spirit.—Upon this supposition, the whole verse describes

<ITEM>And the vast number, of Christ's converts.</ITEM>

q. d. <HI>In the day of thy power,</HI> when thy glorious gospel shall be pub∣lished in the world, and accompanied with marvellous efficacy—In that memorable period, <HI>thy people,</HI> discontinuing the former oblations, commanded under the <HI>Mosaick</HI> law; shall devote <HI>themselves,</HI> as so many living sacrifices to thy honour. Not constrained by force, but charmed with thy excellency, they shall come in <HI>volunteers</HI> to thy ser∣vice, and be <HI>free will offerings</HI> in thy church.—Neither shall they be "empty vines," or bare professors; but shall walk in all the <HI>beauties of holiness,</HI> and bring forth such amiable fruit, as will adorn the doctrine they embrace.—What is still more desirable, they shall be as <HI>numerous</HI> as they are willing and holy. Born to thee in numbers, immense and inconceivable; exceeding even the countless myriads of dew drops, which are begotten by the night, and issue from the womb of the recent morning.</P>
<P>By this interpretation, the text, I think, is cleared of its obscurity and appears both truely sublime, and perfectly just.</P>
<P>May I be pardoned the <HI>digression,</HI> and acquitted from <HI>presumption,</HI> if, on this occasion, I take leave to animadvert upon what seems harsh and unnatural in the common exposition of the last verse of this Psalm? All the commentators (as many, at least, as I have con∣sulted) inform their readers, that to <HI>drink of the brook in the way,</HI> signifies <HI>to undergo sufferings and death.</HI> Which, in my opinion, is a construction extremely forced, and hardly supportable; altogether remote from the import of such poetical forms of diction, cus∣tomary among the eastern nations. In those sultry climes, nothing could be more welcome to the traveller, than a brook streaming near his paths. To quench his thirst, and lave his feet, in the cool∣ing current, was one of the greatest refreshments imaginable, and re∣animated him to pursue his journey. For which reason, among others, brooks are a very favourite image with the inspired penmen; used to denote a situation <HI>fertile</HI> and <HI>delightful,</HI> or a state of <HI>pleasure</HI> and <HI>satis∣faction</HI>; but never, that I can recollect, to picture out the contrary condition of tribulation and distress.</P>
<P>The <HI>water floods,</HI> indeed, in the sacred writings, often represent some imminent danger, or grievous affliction. But then they are not <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—Streams so <HI>calm,</HI> that they keep within their banks, and glide quietly by the traveller's footsteps; so <HI>clear,</HI> that they are fit for the wayfaring man's use, and invite his lips to a draught; both which notions are plainly implied in the text.—They are rather— <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—<HI>boisterous billows</HI>; bursting over a ship or dashing themselves, with dreadful impetuosity, upon the shore: Or—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—<HI>sweeping in∣undations</HI>; which bear down all before them, and drown the neighbour∣ing country.—Besides, in these instances of horrour, we never find the word—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—<HI>He shall drink</HI>; which conveys a pleasing idea (un∣less when it relates to a cup, filled with bitter, intoxicating, or im∣poisoned liquors; a case quite different from that under consideration) but either—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—which imports <HI>terrour</HI> and <HI>astonishment,</HI> or else— <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—which signify to <HI>rush upon,</HI> to <HI>overwhelm,</HI> and even to <HI>bury</HI> under the waves.</P>
<P>Upon the whole: May not the passage more properly allude to the <HI>influences</HI> of the <HI>Holy Ghost?</HI> Which were communicated, in unmeas∣urable degrees, to our great high priest; and were, in fact, the cause of his surmounting all difficulties.—These are frequently represented by <HI>waters</HI>;
<Q>Whoso beleiveth on me, out of his belly shall flow rivers of <HI>living waters.</HI></Q>
The enjoyment of them is described by <HI>drinking</HI>;
<Q>He that <HI>drinketh</HI> of the water that I shall give him, shall never thirst.</Q>—Then, the sense may run in this well con∣nected and perspicuous manner. Is it asked, How shall the Redeem∣er be able to execute the various and important offices, foretold in the preceding parts of the psalm? The prophet replies, <HI>he shall drink of the brook in the way.</HI> He shall not be left barely to his human nature, which must unavoidably sink under the tremendous work of recovering a lost world. But through the whole course of his incarnate state, through the whole administration of his mediatorial kingdom, shall be sup∣ported with ominipotent succours. He shall drink at the brook of al∣mighty power, and travel on in the greatness of an uncreated strength. —<HI>Therefore shall he lift up his head.</HI> By this means, shall he be equal to the prodigious task, and superiour to all opposition. By this means, shall he be thoroughly successful, in whatever he undertakes; and greatly triumphant, over all his enemies.</P></NOTE> <HI>The dew of thy birth is of the womb of the

<PB N="74" REF="021885_0097_0FB5F0E7FA9252E0"/>
the surface of the earth: <HI>So shall thy seed be,</HI> O thou everlasting Father! By the preaching of thy word, shall such an innumerable race of regenerate children be born

unto thee; and prove an ornament and a blessing to all ages, millions, millions of willing converts, from every nation under heaven, shall crowd into thy family, and replenish thy church. Till they become like the stars of the sky, or the sands of the sea for multitude; or even as <HI>numberless</HI> as these fine <HI>spangles,</HI> which now cover the face of nature.—Behold then, ye obstinately wick∣ed, though you
<Q>are not gathered, yet will the Saviour be glorious.</Q>
His design shall not miscarry, nor his labour prove abortive; though you render it of none effect, with regard to yourselves. Think not, that IMMANUEL will want believers, or heaven inhabitants, because <HI>you</HI> continue incorrigible. No; the Lamb that was slain, will "see of the travail of his soul, and be satisfied;" in a never failing series of faithful people below, and an immense choir of glorified saints above. Who shall form his retinue, and surround his throne, in shining and triumphant armies, such as no man can number.</P>
<P>Here, I was reminded of the various expedients which providence, unsearchably wise, uses, to <HI>fructify</HI> both the material and intellectual world.—Sometimes, you shall have <HI>impetuous</HI> and heavy <HI>showers,</HI> bursting from the an∣gry clouds. They lash the plains, and make the rivers foam. A storm brings them, and a deluge follows them. —At other times, these <HI>gentle dews</HI> are formed, in the serene evening air. They steal down by slow degrees, and with insensible stillness. So subtle, that they deceive the nicest eye; so silent, that they escape the most deli∣cate ear: And when fallen, so very light, that they nei∣ther bruise the tenderest, nor oppress the weakest flower. —Very <HI>different</HI> operations! Yet each concurs in the <HI>same</HI> beneficial end, and both impart fertility to the lap of nature.</P>
<P>So, some persons have I known, reclaimed from the un∣fruitful works of darkness, by <HI>violent</HI> and severe means. The Almighty addressed their stubborn hearts, as he ad∣dressed the <HI>Israelites</HI> at <HI>Sinai,</HI> with lightning in his eyes, and thunder in his voice. The conscience, smitten with a sense of guilt, and apprehensive of eternal vengeance, trembled through all her powers; just as that strong mountain tottered to its centre. Pangs of remorse, and
<PB N="76" REF="021885_0099_0FB5F19BF265EAA0"/>
agonies of fear, preceded their new birth. They were reduced to the last extremities, almost overwhelmed with despair, before they found rest in JESUS CHRIST.— Others have been recovered from a vain conversation, by methods more <HI>mild</HI> and attractive. The Father of spirits applied himself to their teachable minds, in
<Q>a still and small voice.</Q>
His grace came down, as the rain in∣to a fleece of wool; or as these softening drops, which now water the earth. The kingdom of GOD took place in their souls, without noise or observation. They passed from death unto life, from a carnal to a regenerate state, by almost imperceptible advances. The transition re∣sembled the growth of corn; was very visible, when effected; though scarce sensible, while accomplishing.— O thou author and finisher of our faith, recal us from our wanderings, and reunite us to thyself! Whether thou <HI>alarm</HI> us with thy terrours, or <HI>allure</HI> us with thy smiles; whether thou drive us with the scourge of con∣viction, or draw us with the cords of love; let us, in any wise, return to thee.

<P>Before I proceed farther, let me ascend the <HI>terrace,</HI> and take one survey of the neighbouring <HI>country.</HI>—What a prospect rushes upon my sight! How vast; how vari∣ous; how "full and plenteous with all manner of store!" Nature's whole wealth!—What a rich and inexhaustible magazine is here: Furnishing subsistence for every crea∣ture! Methinks, I read, in the spacious volumes, a most lively comment, upon that noble celebration of the divine beneficence; <HI>He openeth his hand, and filleth all things living with plenteousness.</HI></P>

<P>The <HI>fields</HI> are covered deep, and stand thick, with corn. They expand the milky <HI>grain</HI> to the sun; while the gales, now inclining, now raising each flexile stem, open all their ranks to the agency of his beams. Which will soon impart a firm consistence to the grain, and a glossy golden hue to the ear. That they may be quali∣fied,

'Tis stocked, no doubt, with variety of <HI>fish</HI>; which afford a solitary diversion to the angler, and nourish for his table a delicious treat. Nor is it the only merit of this liquid element, to maintain the finny nations; it also carries <HI>cleanliness,</HI> and dispenses <HI>fruitfulness,</HI> whereever it rolls the crystal current.</P>
<P>The <HI>pastures,</HI> with their verdant mounds, chequer the prospect; and prepare a standing repast for our cattle. There,
<Q>our oxen are made strong to labour; and our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands.</Q>
There, the horse acquires vigour, for the dispatch of our business, and speed to expedite our journeys. From thence, the kine bring home their udders, distended with one of the richest, and healthiest liquors in the world.</P>
<P>On several spots, a <HI>grove</HI> of trees, like some grand colonnade, erects its tow'ring head. Every one projects a friendly shade, for the beasts; and creates an hospitable lodging for the birds. Every one stands ready, to fur∣nish <HI>timber</HI> for a palace; <HI>masts</HI> for a navy; or, with a more condescending courtesy, <HI>fuel</HI> for our hearths.—One of them seems skirted with a wild uncultivated <HI>heath</HI>; which, like well disposed shades in painting, throws an additional lustre on the more ornamented parts of the landscape. Nor is its usefulness, like that of a foil, relative only, but real. There, several valuable creatures are produced, and accommodated; without any expense, or care of ours. There likewise, spring abundance of those <HI>herbs,</HI> which assuage the smart of our wounds,

<P>Nearer the houses, we perceive an ample spread of branches; not so stately as the oaks, but more amiable for their annual services. A little while ago, I beheld them; and all was one beauteous, boundless waste of <HI>blossoms.</HI> The eye marvelled, at the lovely sight; and the heart rejoiced, in the prospect of autumnal plenty. But now, the blooming maid is resigned, for the useful matron. The flower is fallen, and the <HI>fruit</HI> swells out on every twig.—Breathe soft, ye winds! O, spare the tender fruitage, ye surly blasts! Let the <HI>pear tree</HI> suckle her juicy progeny, till they drop into our hands, and dis∣solve in our mouths. Let the <HI>plum</HI> hang unmolested upon her boughs; till she fatten her delicious flesh, and cloud her polished skin with blue. And as for the <HI>apples,</HI> that staple commodity of our <HI>orchards,</HI> let no injurious shocks precipitate them immaturely to the ground; till revolv∣ing suns, have tinged them with a ruddy complexion, and concocted them into an exquisite flavour.

Some to present us with an early entertainment, and refresh our palates amidst the sultry heats. Some to borrow ripe∣ness from the falling snows, and carry autumn into the depths of winter.

<P>I hope, this little excursion into the country, will not be looked upon as a <HI>departure</HI> from my subject. Because, a rural view, though no essential part of a garden, is yet a desirable appendage, and nec∣essary to <HI>complete</HI> its beauty.—As usefulness is the most valuable prop∣erty which can attend any production; <HI>this</HI> is the circumstance chiefly touched upon in the survey of the landscape▪ Though every piece of this extensive and diversified scene, is cast in the most elegant mould; yet nothing is calculated merely for shew and parade. You see nothing formed in the taste of the ostentatious obelisk, or insignif∣icant pomp of the pyramid. No such idle expenses were admitted into that consummate plan, which regulated the structure of the uni∣verse. All the decorations of nature are no less <HI>advantageous,</HI> than <HI>ornamental</HI>; such as speak the MAKER infinitely beneficent, as well as incomparably magnificent.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>Methinks, the view of this profuse munificence inspires a <HI>secret delight,</HI> and kindles a <HI>disinterested good will.</HI>—While the "little hills clap their hands," and the luxuriant "valleys laugh and sing;" who can for∣bear catching the general joy? Who is not touched with lively sensations of pleasure?—While the everlasting Fa∣ther is scattering blessings through his whole family, and crowning the year with his goodness; who does not feel his breast overflowing, with a diffusive benevolence?— My heart, I must confess, beats high with satisfaction; and breathes out <HI>congratulatory wishes,</HI> upon all the ten∣ants of these rural abodes:
<Q>Peace be within your walls, as well as plenteousness around your dwell∣ings.</Q>
Live, ye highly favoured; live sensible of your benefits, and thankful to your benefactor. Look round upon these prodigiously large incomes of the fruit∣ful soil, and call them (for you have free leave) all your own.—Only let me remind you of one very important truth. Let me suggest, and may you never forget, that you are <HI>obliged</HI> to CHRIST JESUS, for every one of these

accommodations, which sprung from the teaming earth, and the smiling skies.</P>
<P N="1">1. CHRIST <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>When I ascribe the work of creation to the SON, I would by no means be supposed, to withhold the same honour, from the eternal FATHER, and ever blessed SPIRIT. The acts of those inconceiva∣bly g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rious persons are, like their essence, undivided and one. But I choose to state the point in this manner, because this is the manifest doctrine of the new testament; is the express belief of our church; and a most noble peculiarity of the gospel revelation.—I choose it also, because I would take every opportunity of inculcating, and celebrating the <HI>divinity</HI> of the REDEEMER. A truth, which imparts an unut∣terable dignity to christianity: A truth, which lays an immoveable foundation, for all the comfortable hopes of a christian: A truth, which will render the mystery of our redemption, the wonder and delight of eternity: And with this truth, every one will observe, my assertion is inseparably connected.</P>
<P>If any one questions, whether this be the doctrine of our church; let the <HI>creed,</HI> which we repeat in our most solemn devotions, deter∣mine his doubt: "I believe," says that form of sound words,
<Q>in one LORD JESUS CHRIST, very God of very GOD, <HI>by whom all things were made.</HI></Q>
—If it be farther inquired, from whence the <HI>Nicene</HI> fathers derived this article of their faith? I answer, from the writings of the beloved desciple, who lay on the Saviour's bosom; and of that great apostle, who had been caught up into the third heaven.</P>
<BIBL><HI>John</HI> i.3. <HI>Coloss.</HI> i.16.</BIBL></NOTE> <HI>made</HI> them, when they were not.— He fetched them up from utter darkness; and gave them both their being, and their beauty. He created the ma∣terials, of which they are composed; and moulded them into this endless multiplicity, of amiable forms, and useful substances. He arrayed the heavens, with a ves∣ture of the mildest blue; and clothed the earth in a livery of the gayest green. His pencil streaked, and his breath perfumed, whatever is beautiful or fragrant in the universe. His strength set fast the mountains; his goodness garnished the vales; and the same <HI>touch</HI> which healed the <HI>leper,</HI> wrought the whole visible <HI>system</HI> into this complete perfection.</P>
<P N="2">2. CHRIST <HI>recovered</HI> them, when they were forfeit∣ed.—By <HI>Adam</HI>'s sin, we lost our right to the comforts of life, and fruits of the ground. His disobedience was the most impious and horrid <HI>treason,</HI> against the KING of kings. Consequently, his whole patrimony became <HI>confiscated</HI>; as well the portion of temporal good

things, settled upon the human race during their minor∣ity; as that everlasting heritage reserved for their en∣joyment, when they should come to full age.

<P>We learn from hence, in what a peculiar and endearing light, the <HI>christian</HI> is to contemplate the things that are seen. <HI>Heathens</HI> might discover an eternal power, and infinite wisdom, in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> structure of the universe: Heathens might acknowledge a most stupendous liber∣ality, in the unreserved grant of the whole fabrick, with all its furni∣ture, to the service of man.

He should recieve the gifts of indulgent providence, as the <HI>Israelites</HI> re∣ceived their law, from the hand of a Mediator.

<P>I beg leave to subjoin St. <HI>Chrysostom</HI>'s pertinent and beautiful note, upon the passage; by which it will appear, that the sen∣timent of these sections, is not merely a private opinion, but the avowed belief of the primitive church. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, says the eloquent father, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P></NOTE> His finger rolls the seasons round, and presides over all the celestial revolutions.

than they could create themselves. <HI>Start</HI> they would into instant <HI>confusion</HI>; or <HI>drop</HI> into their primitive <HI>nothing</HI>; did not his power support, and his wisdom reg∣ulate them, every moment.

<P>Having surveyed the spacious sky, and sent a glance round the inferiour creation, it is time to descend from this eminence, and confine my attention to the <HI>beautiful spot</HI> below—Here nature, always pleasing, every where lovely, appears with peculiar attractions. Yonder, she seems dressed in her dishabille; grand, but irregular. Here, she calls in her hand maid art; and shines in all the delicate ornaments, which the nicest cultivation is able to convey. <HI>Those,</HI> are her common apartments, where she lodges her ordinary guests; <HI>This,</HI> is her cabi∣net of curiosities, where she entertains her intimate ac∣quaintance.—My eye shall often expatiate over those scenes of universal fertility: My feet shall sometimes brush through the thicket, or traverse the lawn, or stroll along the forest glade: But to this delightful retreat, shall be my chief resort. Thither, will I <HI>make excur∣sions</HI>; but here, will I <HI>dwell.</HI></P>
<P>If, from my low procedure, I may form an allusion to the most exalted practices; I would observe upon this occasion, that the celebrated <HI>Erasmus,</HI> and our judicious <HI>Locke,</HI> having trod the circle of the sciences, and ranged through the whole extent of <HI>human</HI> literature, at length betook themselves solely to the <HI>Bible.</HI> Leaving the sages of antiquity, they sat incessantly at the feet of JESUS. Wisely they withdrew, from that immense multiplicity of learning; from those endless tracts of amusing erudi∣tion, where noxious weeds are mixed with wholesome herbs; where, is generally a much larger growth of prickly shrubs, than of fruitful boughs. They spent their most mature hours, in those hallowed gardens, which GOD's own wisdom planted; which GOD's own spirit watereth; and in which GOD's own son is continually
<PB N="86" REF="021885_0109_0FB5F1BB4EC693D8"/>
walking. Where, he meeteth those that seek him; and revealeth to them the glories of his person, and the riches or his goodness.</P>
<P>Thus would I finish the remainder of my days! Having just <HI>tasted</HI> (what they call) the politer studies; I would now devote my whole <HI>application</HI> to the lively ora∣cles. From other pursuits, I might glean, perhaps, a few scattered fragments of low, of lean, of unsatisfactory instruction. From this, I trust to reap a harvest of the sublimest truths▪ the noblest improvements; and the purest joys.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quicquid docetur, veritas; quicquid, praecipitur, bonitas; quicquid promittitur, felicitas.</NOTE>—Wast me then, O! wast my mind to <HI>Sion</HI>'s consecrated bowers.

Here grow those heaven born plants, the trees of <HI>life</HI> and <HI>knowledge</HI>; whose ambrosial fruits we now may
<Q>take and eat, and live forever.</Q>
Here, flow those prec∣ious streams of <HI>grace</HI> and <HI>righteousness</HI>; whose living wa∣ters "whosoever drinks, shall thirst no more." And what can the fables of <HI>Grecian</HI> song, or the finest pages of <HI>Roman</HI> eloquence—what can they exhibit, in any de∣gree comparable to these matchless prerogatives of reve∣lation?—Therefore, though I should not dislike to pay a <HI>visit</HI> now and then to my heathen masters, I would <HI>live</HI> with the prophets and apostles. With those, I would carry on some occasional correspondence; but these should be my bosom friends; my inseparable companions; "my delight, and my counsellors."</P>
<P>What <HI>sweets</HI> are these, which so agreeably salute my nostrils? They are the breath of the flowers; the in∣cense of the garden.—How liberally does the jessamine dispense her odoriserous riches? How deliciously has the woodbine embalmed this morning walk? The air is all perfume.—And is not this, another most engaging ar∣gument, to forsake the bed of <HI>sloth?</HI> Who would lie dis∣solved in senseless slumbers; while so many breathing sweets, invite him to a feast of fragrancy? Especially considering, that the advancing day will exhale the vol∣atile dainties. A <HI>fugitive treat</HI> they are, prepared only for the wakeful and industrious. Whereas, when the

<P>With this very <HI>motive,</HI> heightened by a representa∣tion of the most charming pieces of morning scenery, the parent of mankind awakes his lovely consort. There is such a delicacy in the choice, and so much life in the description of these rural images, that I cannot excuse myself, without repeating the whole passage.—Whisper it, some friendly <HI>genius</HI> in the ear of every one, who is now sunk in sleep, and lost to all these refined gratifi∣cations!</P>

<P>In a grove of tulips, or a knot of pinks, one per∣ceives a difference in almost every individual. Scarce any two, are turned and tinctured exactly alike. Each allows himself a little <HI>particularity</HI> in his <HI>dress,</HI> though all be∣long to one family; so that they are various, and yet the same.—A pretty emblem this, of the <HI>smaller differences</HI> between protestant christians. There are modes in re∣ligion, which admit of variation, without prejudice to sound faith, or real holiness. Just as the drapery, on these pictures of the spring, may be formed after a va∣riety of patterns, without blemishing their beauty, or al∣tering their nature.—Be it so then, that, in some points of inconsiderable consequence, several of our brethren dissent; yet, let us all live amicably and sociably togeth∣er; for we harmonize in <HI>principles,</HI> though we vary in <HI>punctilios.</HI> Let us join in conversation, and intermingle interests; discover no estrangement of behaviour, and cherish no alienation of affection. If any strife subsists, let it be to follow our Divine Master most closely, in hu∣mility of heart, and unblameableness of life. Let it be to serve one another most readily, in all the kind offices of a cordial friendship. Thus shall we be <HI>united,</HI> though <HI>distinguished</HI>; united in the same grand fundamentals, though distinguished by some small circumstantials; unit∣ed in one important bond of brotherly love, though dis∣tinguished by some slighter peculiarities of sentiment.</P>
<P>Between christians, whose judgments disagree only about a form of prayer, or manner of worship, I appre∣hend there is no more <HI>essential</HI> difference, than between flowers which bloom from the same kind of seed, but happen to be somewhat diversified in the mixture of their colours. Whereas, if <HI>one</HI> denies the divinity of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, and degrades the incarnate GOD to the meanness of a mere creature; if <HI>another</HI> cries up the worthiness of human works, and depreciates the alone meritorious righteousness of the glorious Mediator; if a <HI>third</HI> addresses the incommunicable honours to a finite be∣ing,

and bows to the image, or prays to the saint—These are errours, extremely derogatory to the REDEEMER's dignity, and not a little prejudicial to the comfort of his people: Against these to remonstate; against these to urge every argument, and use every dissuasive, bespeaks not the censorious bigot, but the friend of truth, and the lover of mankind. Whereas, to stand neuter and silent, while such principles are propagated, would be an instance of criminal remissness, rather than of christian modera∣tion. For the <HI>persons,</HI> we will not fail to maintain a ten∣der compassion; we will not cease to put up earnest in∣tercessions; we will also acknowledge and love, whatever is excellent and amiable in their character. Yet, we dare not subscribe their <HI>creed;</HI> we must not secrete our strong reasons; we cannot remit our assiduous, but kind endeav∣ours, if by any means we may reconcile them to a more <HI>scriptural</HI> belief, and a <HI>purer</HI> worship.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In some former editions, I expressed myself on this point, <HI>un∣w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rily</HI> and <HI>harshly.</HI> But my meaning, and real sentiments, were no other than those represented above.—The reader, from such unguard∣ed intimations, might too naturally be led to conclude, that the au∣thor avows, and would stir up a spirit of <HI>persecution.</HI> But, this is a method of dealing with opponents in religious doctrines, which he disclaims, as absurd; and abhors, as iniquitous. He is for no force, but that of rational conviction; for no constraint, but that of affec∣tionate persuasion. <HI>Thus,</HI> if you please, <HI>compel them to come in,</HI> Luke xiv.23.</NOTE></P>
<P>Another circumstance, recommending and endear∣ing the flowery creation, is their <HI>regular succession.</HI> They make not their appearance all at once, but in an orderly rotation. While a proper number of these obliging re∣tainers are in waiting, the others abscond; but hold them∣selves in a posture of service, ready to take their turn, and fill each his respective station, the instant it becomes vacant. The <HI>snowdrop,</HI> foremost of the lovely train, breaks her way through the frozen soil, in order to pre∣sent her early compliments to her Lord. Dressed in the robe of innocency, she steps forth, fearless of danger; long before the trees have ventured to unfold their leaves, even while the icicles are pendent on our houses. Next, peeps out the <HI>crocus;</HI> but cautiously, and with an air of timidity. She hears the howling blasts, and skulks close to her low situation. Afraid she seems, to make large

excursions from her root; while so many ruffian winds are abroad, and scouring along the aether. Nor is the <HI>violet</HI> last, in this shining embassy of the year, which, with all the embellishments, that would grace a royal garden, condescends to line our hedges, and grow at the feet of briars. Freely, and without any solicitation, she distributes the bounty of her emissive sweets; while herself, with an exemplary humility, retires from sight; seeking rather to administer pleasure, than to win admi∣ration.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prodesse quam conspici.</NOTE> Emblem, expressive emblem, of those <HI>modest</HI> vir∣tues, which delight to bloom in obscurity; which extend a cheering influence to multitudes, who are scarce ac∣quainted with the source of their comforts! Motive, en∣gaging motive, to that <HI>ever active</HI> beneficence; which stays not for the importunity of the distressed, but antic∣ipates their suit, and prevents them with the blessings of its goodness! The poor <HI>polyanthus,</HI> that lately adorn∣ed the border with her sparkling beauties, and, trans∣planted into our windows, gave us a fresh entertainment; is now no more. I saw her complexion fade; I perceived her breath decay, till at length she expired, and dropt in∣to her grave.—Scarce have we sustained this loss, but in comes the <HI>auricula,</HI> and more than retrieves it. Ar∣rayed she comes, in a splendid variety of amiable forms; with an eye of crystal, and garments of the most glossy sattin; exhaling perfume, and powdered with silver. A very distinguished procession this! The favourite care of the florist! Scarce one among them, but is dignified with a character of renown; or has the honour to represent some celebrated toast. But these also, notwithstanding their illustrious titles, have exhausted their whole stock of fra∣grance, and are mingled with the meanest dust.—Who could forbear grieving at their departure, did not the <HI>tu∣lips</HI> begin to raise themselves on their fine wands, or state∣ly stalks? They flush the paterre with one of the gayest dresses that blooming nature wears. Did ever <HI>beau</HI> or <HI>belle</HI> make so gaudy an appearance, in a birth night suit?

her, were I to call her a <HI>coquet;</HI> because, she plays her lovely changes, not to enkindle dissolute affections, but to display her Creator's glory.—Soon arises the <HI>anemone;</HI> encircled at the bottom, with a spreading robe; and rounded at the top, into a beautiful dome. In its loose∣ly flowing mantle, you may observe a noble negligence; in its gently bending tufts, the nicest symmetry. I would term it, the <HI>fine gentleman</HI> of the garden; because, it seems to have learned the singular address, of uniting simplic∣ity with refinement, of reconciling art and ease.— The same month has the merit of producing the <HI>ranun∣culus.</HI> All bold and graceful, it expands the riches of its foliage; and acquires, by degrees, the lovliest enamel in the world. As persons of intrinsick worth, disdain the superficial arts of recommendation, practised by <HI>fops;</HI> so, this lordly flower scorns to borrow any of its excel∣lence, from powders and essences. It needs no such at∣tractives, to render it the darling of the curious; being sufficiently engaging from the elegance of its figure, the radiant variety of its tinges, and a certain superiour dignity of aspect.—Methinks, nature improves in her operations. Her latest strokes are most masterly. To crown the collection, she introduces the <HI>carnation.</HI> Which captivates every eye, with a noble spread of graces; and charms another sense, with a profusion of exquisite o∣dours. This single flower has centered in itself, the per∣fections of all the preceding. The moment it appears, it so commands our attention, that we scarce regret the ab∣sence of the rest.—The <HI>gilly flower,</HI> like a real friend, at∣tends you through all the vicissitudes and alterations of the season. While others make a transient visit only, this is rather an inhabitant, than a guest in your gar∣dens; adds <HI>fidelity</HI> to <HI>complaisance.</HI></P>
<P>It is in vain to attempt a catalogue of these amiable gifts. There is an endless <HI>multiplicity,</HI> in their charac∣ters; yet an invariable <HI>order,</HI> in their approaches. Every month, almost every week, has its peculiar ornaments; not servilely copying the works of its predecessor, but forming, still forming, and still executing some new de∣sign. So lavish is the fancy, yet so exact is the process, of nature!</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="021885_0125_0FB5F1F44E2E9D80"/>Here, let me stand a while, to contemplate this <HI>dis∣tribution</HI> of flowers, through the several periods of the year.—Were they all to blossom together, there would be at once a promiscuous <HI>throng,</HI> and at once a total <HI>pri∣vation.</HI> We should scarce have an opportunity, of advert∣ing to the dainty qualities of half; and must soon lose the agreeable company of them all.

We can view and review their forms; enter into a more intimate acquain∣tance with their charming accomplishments; and receive all those pleasing services, which they are commissioned to yield.—This remarkable piece of economy, is pro∣ductive of another very valuable effect.

<P>These, O my soul, are the regulations of that most adorable, that most beneficent being, who bowed the Heavens; came down to dwell on earth; and united the <HI>frailty</HI> of thy mortal nature, to all the <HI>glories</HI> of his God∣head. All the honour of this admirable establishment, belongs to thy ransom, thy surety, thy Saviour. To Him it belongs, who sustained the <HI>vengeance,</HI> which thou hadst deserved, and wast doomed to suffer; who fulfilled the <HI>obedience,</HI> which thou wast obliged, but unable, to perform; and who humbled himself (stupendous, ineffa∣ble loving kindness!) humbled himself to death, even the death of the cross.—He formed this vast machine, and adjusted its nice dependencies. The pillars, that sup∣port it; the embellishments, that adorn it; and the laws, that govern it; are the result of his unsearchable coun∣sels. O! the <HI>heights</HI> of his majesty, and the <HI>depths</HI> of his abasement!</P>
<P>Which shall we admire most, his essential <HI>greatness,</HI> or his free <HI>grace?</HI> He created the exalted seraph, that sings in glory; and every the minutest insect, that flutters in air, or crawls in dust. He marks out a path, for all those globes of light, which travel the circuit of the skies; and disdains not to rear the violet from its lowly bed, or to plait the daisy which dresses our plains.

Other senses of the passage, I acknowl∣edge, may be assigned with equal propriety.

When, struck with astonishment, we consider their grandeur, beauty, and consummate perfections; let us, in justice to their author, apply the exalted reflection of this sacred ode:
<Q>In all these <HI>is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iding,</HI> rather an adequate display, <HI>of his</HI> matchless <HI>power.</HI> Though they challenge our praise, and surpass our comprehension; yet they are by no means the utmost exertions, but rather some slighter essays, of omnipotent skill.</Q>
—<HI>Milton,</HI> relating the overthrow of the fallen angels, introduces a gran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> circumstance, not much unlike the preceding. <HI>Messiah,</HI> unaided and alone, had routed an innumer∣able host of apostate spirits. This was great and marvellous. But to create a juster idea of the illustrious conqueror, our poet beautifully adds;
<Q>Yet half his strength he put not forth.</Q>
If we forget to make the same remark, when we contemplate GOD in his works; we must necessarily form very scanty conceptions of that SUPREME BEING, before whom all nations are as a

<P>Thus, I think, we should always view the visible system; with an evangelical <HI>telescope</HI> (if I may be al∣lowed the expression) and with an evangelical <HI>micro∣scope.</HI> Regarding CHRIST JESUS, as the great pro∣jector and architect; who planned, and executed, the amazing scheme. Whatever is magnificent or valuable tremendous or amiable; should ever be ascribed to the redeemer. This, is the christian's <HI>natural philosophy.</HI>
<PB N="105" REF="021885_0128_0FB5F201D987C440"/>
With regard to this method of considering the things that are seen; we have an inspired apostle for our pre∣ceptor and precedent. Speaking of CHRIST, he says;
<Q>Thou, LORD, in the beginning, hast laid the foun∣dation of the earth; and the heavens are the work of thy hands.</Q>
—Did we carefully attend to this leading principle, in all our examinations of nature; it would, doubtless, be a most powerful means of <HI>enkindling</HI> our love, and <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The apostles, I observe, delight to use this method of dis∣playing the <HI>honours</HI> of the Redeemer, and establishing the <HI>faith</HI> of his people—The beloved disciple, teaching that most precious doc∣trine, "of a Lamb slain to take away the sins of the world;" in order to evince the sufficiency of CHRIST's sacrifice for this blessed purpose, affirms, that <HI>all things were made by him: And without him was not any thing,</HI> no, not so much as one single being, <HI>made,</HI> John i.3.—St. <HI>Paul,</HI> preaching the same glad tidings to the <HI>Colossians,</HI> and expressly maintaining, that we have redemption through his blood; seems to foresee an objection of this kind.
<Q>To expiate transgressions against an infinite majesty, is a most prodigious act. It must cost vastly more than any common surety can pay, to redeem a sinful world. What reason have we to believe, that JESUS, is equal to this mighty undertaking?</Q>
All possible reason, replies the apostle, from the dignity of his person, for he is <HI>the image of the invisible</HI> GOD; and from the greatness of his works, for <HI>by him all things were made.</HI> Consider the operations of his hands, and you cannot doubt the atoning efficacy of his death, <HI>Col.</HI> i.15, 16.—The author of the epistle to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> falls exactly into the same train of arguing. Declaring, that CHRIST JESUS has purged our sins, by the sacrifice of himself; he proves his ample ability for this tremen∣dous office, from his essential excellence because he is the <HI>brightness of his father's glory</HI>; and from his admirable works, because <HI>he made the worlds, and upholdeth all things by the word of his power,</HI> Heb. i.2, 3.—Which truth, as it is so important in itself; of such signal comfort to christians; and so particularly insisted on, by the in∣spired writers; I hope, I shall need no apology, for an attempt to illustrate and enforce it, in a kind of evangelical <HI>Descant</HI> on <HI>Creation,</HI> annexed to these reflections.</NOTE> <HI>strengthening</HI> our faith. When I look round upon millions of noble substances, and carry with me this transporting reflection,

how can I remain any longer indifferent? Must not the <HI>coldest</HI> heart, begin to glow with gratitude?—When I survey an immensity of the finest productions imaginable; and remember, that the author of them all, is my

<PB N="106" REF="021885_0129_0FB5F2035080ABA0"/>
how can I choose but repose the most <HI>cheer∣ful</HI> confidence, in such a Mediator?</P>
<P>Let me add one more remark, upon the admirable <HI>ad∣justment</HI> of every particular, relating to these fine colo∣nies planted in the paterre.—With such accuracy and correctness is their structure finished, that any the least conceivable alteration, would very much impair their per∣fection. Should you see, for instance, the nice disposi∣tion of the <HI>tulip</HI>'s attire fly abroad, disorderly and irreg∣ular, like the flaunting <HI>woodbine</HI>: Should the <HI>jessamine</HI> rear her diminutive head on those grand columns which supports the <HI>hollihock</HI>: Should the erect and manly aspect of the <HI>piony,</HI> hang down with a pensive air, like the flex∣ile bells of the <HI>hyacinth</HI>: Should that noble plainness, which distinguishes the <HI>lily,</HI> be exchanged for the glitter∣ing fringes which edge the <HI>pink,</HI> or the gaudy stains which bedrop the <HI>iris</HI>: Should those tapering pillars, which arise in the middle of its vase, and, tipt with golden pen∣dants, give such a lustre to the surrounding pannels of ala∣baster—Should those sink and disappear, like the chives which cover the heart of the <HI>anemone</HI>:—In many of these cases, would not the transposition be fantastical and aukward? In all, to the apparent <HI>prejudice</HI> of every indi∣vidual?</P>
<P>Again; with regard to the <HI>time</HI> of their appearing; this circumstance is settled, by a remarkable foresight and precaution. What would become of the <HI>sailor,</HI> if in very stormy weather, he should raise a lofty mast, and crowd it with all his canvas! Such would be the ill effect; if the most stately species of flowers, should presume to come abroad in the blustering months. Ah! how would they rue the imprudent boldness! Therefore, those only that shoot the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>test stems, and display the smallest spread of leaves, or (if you please) carry the least sail, are launched amidst the blowing seasons.

His decrees, are the re∣sult of infinite discernment; and his dispensations, the issues of unbounded benevolence.—But man, fallen man, is hurried away, by his lusts, into a thousand irregularities; which are deplorably evil <HI>in themselves,</HI> and attended with <HI>consequences</HI> manifestly perni∣cious to society.—Let the sentiment, therefore, be restrained to the disposals of Heaven, and I most readily subscribe it. But, if it be extended to the conduct of men, and the effects of their folly, I think myself obliged to enter my protest against it. For, whatever kindles the divine indignation—is cause of final ruin to the author —is strictly forbidden by GOD's holy word—is contrary to the whole design of his revealed will, and the very reverse of his essential attri∣butes—<HI>This,</HI> cannot possibly be right. <HI>This,</HI> is most undoubtedly wrong. Omnipotence, indeed, can overrule it, and educe good from it. But the very notion of <HI>overruling,</HI> supposes it to be absolutely <HI>wrong</HI> in itself.</NOTE> <HI>is right,</HI> is best.</P>
<P>Among all the productions of the third creating day, this of flowers seems to be peculiarly designed for man.

See the <HI>tuberose,</HI> delicate and languishingly fair! See all the pomp and glory of the parterre, where paint and perfume do wonders. Yet the inferiour animals are neither smit with their beau∣ties, nor regaled with their odours. The horse never stands still to gaze upon their charms; nor does the ox turn aside to browse upon their sweets. Senses they have, to discern these curious objects in the <HI>gross,</HI> but no taste, to <HI>distinguish</HI> or relish their fine accomplishments.—Just so▪ carnal and unenlightened men may understand the literal meaning of scripture, may comprehend the evi∣dences of its divine inspiration; yet, have no <HI>relish</HI> of the heavenly truths it teaches, no ardent <HI>longing</HI> for the spiritual blessings it offers; and see

in the Saviour it describes, so as to render him the <HI>supreme</HI> desire of their souls.</P>

Let their praises become vocal in thy songs.—Adore the Supreme Benefactor for the bles∣sings he showers down upon every order of beings.

obliged to a generous friend, who should <HI>build</HI> a stately edifice, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I cannot persuade myself, that the comparison is stretched be∣yond proper bounds, when carried to this pitch. It is my stedfast opinion, that the world, at least this lower world, with its vari∣ous appurtenances, was intended <HI>purely</HI> for man; that it is <HI>appro∣priated</HI> to him; and that he (in subordination to GOD's glory) is the <HI>end</HI> of its creation.—Other animals, it is true, partake of the Creator's benefits; but then, they partake, under the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>otion of man's domesticks, or on the foot of retainers to him; as crea∣tures which bear some relation to his service, and some way or other contribute to his good. So that, still, he is the <HI>centre</HI> of the whole; or, as our incomparable <HI>Milton,</HI> equally master of poetry and divinity, expresses himself, <HI>All things live for man. Par. Lost,</HI> B. XI.161.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> in his ethick epistles, is pleased to explode this tenet, as the height of <HI>pride,</HI> and a gross <HI>absurdity.</HI>—For my part, I see no reason for such a charge. With all submission to so superiour a genius, it seems very remote from pride, to be duly sensible of fa∣vours vouchsafed; to contemplate them in all the extent of their munificence, and acknowledge them accordingly. I should rather imagine, that to contract their size, when they are immensely large; to stint their number, when they are altogether innumerable; that such a procedure favours more of <HI>insensibility,</HI> than our hypothesis of pre∣sumption; and has more in it of <HI>ingratitude,</HI> than that of arrogance.</P>
<P>And how can it be deemed an absurdity, to maintain that GOD gave us <HI>a world</HI> for our possession, when it is our duty to believe, that he gave us his <HI>only son,</HI> for our propitiation? Sure, it can be neither difficult, nor extravagant to suppose, that he designed the habitable globe, with its whole furniture, for our present use, since he withheld not his holy child JESUS, but freely delivered him up, for our final salvation.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I cannot but conclude, that the attempt of our famous poet is neither <HI>kind,</HI> with regard to his fellow creatures —nor <HI>grateful,</HI> with regard to his Creator—neither is his scheme, in fact, <HI>true.</HI> The attempt not <HI>kind,</HI> with regard to man; because, it robs him of one of the most delightful and ravishing contempla∣tions imaginable. To consider the great author of existence, as hav∣ing <HI>me</HI> in his eye, when he formed universal nature; as contriving all things, with an immediate view to the exigencies of my par∣ticular state; and making them all in such a manner, as might be most conducive to my particular advantage: This must occasion the strongest satisfactions, whenever I cast a glance on the objects that surround me—Not <HI>grateful,</HI> with regard to GOD; because it has the most direct tendency to diminish our sense of his kindness, and by that means to throw a damp upon our gratitude. It teaches us to look upon ourselves, as almost lost among a croud of other beings, or regarded only with an occasional and incidental beneficence. Which must certainly weaken the disposition, and indeed slacken the ties to the most adoring thankfulness.—To which, I apprehend, we may justly add, Neither is the scheme, in fact, <HI>true.</HI> For, not to mention what might be urged from the sure word of revelation, this one argument appears sufficiently conclusive. The world began with man; the world must cease with man; consequently, the grand use, the principal end of the world, is, to subserve the interest of man. It is on all sides agreed, that the edifice was erected, when man was to be furnished with an habitation; and that it will be demolished, when man has no farther need of its accommodations. When he enters into the house not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens, "the earth, and all the works that are therein, shall be burnt up." From which it seems a very obvious and fair deduction, that man is the <HI>final cause</HI> of this inferiour creation.</P>
<P>So that I think my readers and myself <HI>privileged</HI> (not to say, on the principles of gratitude, <HI>obliged</HI>) to use those lovely lines of our author, with a propriety and truth equal to their elegance and beauty:

<P>Yonder tree, which faces the south, has something too remarkable to pass without observation.—Like the fruitful though feeble vine, she brings forth a large family of branches; but, unable to support them herself, commits them to the tuition of a sunny wall.

<P>There is another subject of the verdant kingdom, which, on account of its very uncommon qualities, de∣mands my particular notice: One so extremely diffident in her disposition, and delicate in her constitution, that she dares not venture herself abroad in the open air, but is nursed up in the warmth of a <HI>hot bed,</HI> and lives clois∣tered in the cells of a <HI>green house</HI>; but the most curi∣ous peculiarity is, that, of all her kindred species, she alone partakes of <HI>perceptive</HI> life, at least advances near∣est to this more exalted state of being, and may be look∣ed upon as the link which connects the animal and the vegetable world. A stranger, observing her motions, would almost be induced to suspect, that she is endued with some inferiour degrees of consciousness and cau∣tion. For, if you offer to handle this <HI>sensitive plant,</HI> she immediately takes an alarm, hastily contracts her fibres, and, like a person under apprehensions of vio∣lence, <HI>withdraws</HI> from your finger, in a kind of precip∣itate <HI>disorder.</HI> Perhaps the beauty of her aspect might be fullied, or the niceness of her texture discomposed, by the human touch. Therefore, like a coy virgin, she
<PB N="124" REF="021885_0147_0FB5F2460DAA5250"/>
recedes from all unbecoming familiarities, and will admit no such improper, if not pernicious, freedoms.</P>
<P>Whatever be the cause of this unusual effect, it suggests an instructive admonition to the christian. <HI>Such</HI> should be our apprehensive timorous care, with regard to sin, and all, even the most distant approaches of vice. <HI>So</HI> should we avoid the very appearance of evil, and stand aloof from every occasion of falling.—If sin∣ners entice, if forbidden pleasures tempt, or if oppor∣tunity beckon, with the gain of injustice in her hand, O! turn from the gilded snare, touch not the beauteous bane; but fly, fly with haste, fly without any delay, from the bewitching ruin.—Does <HI>anger</HI> draw near with her lighted torch, to kindle the flame of resentment in our breasts? Does <HI>flattery</HI> ply our ears, with her enchant∣ing and intoxicating whispers? Would <HI>discontent</HI> lay her leaden hand upon our temper, and mould into our minds her sour leaven, in order to make us a burden to ourselves, and unamiable to others? Instantly let us di∣vert our attention from the dangerous objects, and not so much endeavour to <HI>antidote,</HI> as to <HI>shun</HI> the moral con∣tagion. Let us revolve in our meditations, that wonder∣ful <HI>meekness</HI> of our distressed master, which, amidst the most abusive and provoking insults, maintained an uni∣form tenour of unshaken serenity. Let us contemplate that prodigious <HI>humiliation,</HI> which brought him from an infinite height above all worlds, to make his bed in the dust of death. Let us soothe our jarring, our uneasy passions, with the remembrance of that <HI>cheerfulness</HI> and <HI>resignation,</HI> which rendered him, in the deepest poverty, unfeignedly thankful; and, under the heaviest tribula∣tions, most submissively patient.</P>
<P>Harbour not, on any consideration, the betrayer of your virtue. Always maintain a <HI>holy sensibility</HI> of soul. Be deaf, inflexibly deaf, to every beguil∣ing solicitation. If it obtrude into the unguarded heart, give it entertainment, no, not for a moment. To par∣ley with the enemy, is to open a door for destruction.

In such a case, none would stand a moment to consider, or to debate with himself the expe∣diency of the thing.

As the roots even of our choicest flowers, when deposited in the ground, are rude and ungraceful, but, when they spring up into blooming life, are most elegant and splendid; so the flesh of a saint, when committed to the dust, alas! what is it? A heap of corruption; a mass of putrefying clay. But, when it obeys the great Archangel's call, and starts into a new existence, what an astonishing change ensues! What a most ennobling improvement takes place!—That which was sown in <HI>weakness,</HI> is raised in all the vivacity of <HI>power.</HI> That which was sown in <HI>deformity,</HI> is raised in the bloom of celestial <HI>beauty.</HI> Exalted, refined, and glorified, it will shine "as the brightness of the firmament," when it darts the inimitable blue, through the fleeces—the snowy fleeces of some cleaving cloud.</P>
<P>Fear not then, thou faithful christian; fear not, at the appointed time, to descend into the tomb. Thy <HI>soul</HI> thou mayest trust with thy omnipotent Redeemer, who is LORD of the unseen world;
<Q>Who has the keys of hell and of death.</Q>
Most safely mayest thou trust thy better part in those beneficent hands, which were pierced with nails, and fastened to the ignominious tree, for thy salvation.—With regard to thy <HI>earthly tabernacle,</HI> be not dismayed. It is taken down, only to be rebuilt upon a diviner plan, and in a more heavenly form. If it retires into the shadow of death, and lies immured in the gloom of the grave, it is only to return from a short confinement, to endless liberty. If it falls into dissolution, it is in order to rise more illustrious from its ruins, and wear an infinitely brighter face of perfec∣tion and of glory.</P>

<P>To <HI>know the love of</HI> CHRIST; to have such a deep apprehension of his unspeakable kindness, as may pro∣duce in our hearts an adoring gratitude, and an unfeigned faith: This, according to St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s estimate, is the highest and happiest attainment in the sacred science of Chris∣tianity.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. iii.19.</NOTE> What follows, is an attempt to assist the atten∣tive mind, in learning a line or two of that best and greatest lesson.

<P>Can there be a more powerful incentive to devout <HI>gratitude,</HI> than to consider the magnificent and delicate scenes of the universe, with a particular reference to CHRIST, as the Creator?—Every object, viewed in this light, will surely administer incessant recruits to

<P>Can any thing impart a stronger <HI>joy</HI> to the believer, or more effectually confirm his <HI>faith</HI> in the crucified JE∣SUS, than to behold the Heavens declaring his glory, and the firmament shewing his handy work?—Surely, it must be matter of inexpressible consolation to the poor sinner, to observe the honours of his Redeemer, written with sun beams, over all the face of the world.</P>
<P>We delight to read an account of our incarnate JE∣HOVAH, as he is revealed in the books of <HI>Moses</HI> and the prophets, as he is displayed in the writings of the evangelists and apostles.

<P>Should any be inclined to suspect the solidity of the following observations, or to condemn them, as the voice of rant, and the lawless flight of fancy; I must intreat such persons to recollect, that the grand doc∣trine, the hinge on which they all turn, is warranted and established by the unanimous testimony of the inspired penmen, who frequently celebrate IMMANUEL, or CHRIST JESUS, as the great Almighty cause of all; assuring us, that <HI>all things were created by him, and for him; and that in him all things consist.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Col.</HI> i.16, 17.

While CHRIST was the Prince of peace, and came not to destroy men's lives, but to save. Because, any madman on earth, or fury from Hell, is capable of venting his rage. But who, amidst such unsufferable provocations and barbarities; who, having in his own hand, the power to rescue himself, the power to avenge himself; could submit to all, with an unruffled serenity of patience; and not only not be exasperated, but <HI>overcome,</HI> in so triumphant a manner, <HI>evil with good?</HI> None but CHRIST!

<P>The author, having acknowledged his crimes to be beyond mea∣sure heinous, and almost beyond forgiveness provoking;—so provoking as to render tears from such eyes offensive, and prayers from such lips abominable;—composes himself to submit, without the least re∣pining sentiment; to submit, even with praise and adoration, to the most dreadful doom. Accordingly, he stands in resigned expectation of being instantly struck by the bolts of vengeance; but—with a turn of thought equally surprising and sprightly; with a faith properly sounded, and happily firm; he adds,
<Q><L>Yet where! O where! <HI>can</HI> ev'n thy thunders fall?</L>

Tell the sinful wretch, what pity yearns in IMMANU∣EL's bowels; what blood he has spilt, what agonies he has endured, what wonders he has wrought, for the sal∣vation of his enemies. Invite the indigent to become rich; entreat the guilty to accept of pardon; because, with the crucified JESUS is plenteous redemption, and all sufficiency to save—While you, placed in conspicu∣ous stations, pour the joyful sound; may I, as I steal through the vale of humble life, catch the pleasing ac∣cents!

<P>But, when men and angels raise the grand hymn; when all worlds, and all beings, add their <HI>collective</HI> ac∣clamations; this full, fervent, and universal chorus, will be so <HI>inferiour</HI> to the riches of the REDEEMER's grace; so disproportionate to the magnificence of his glory, that it will seem but to <HI>debase</HI> the unutterable subject it at∣tempts to exalt.

<HEAD>TO PAUL ORCHARD, OF STOKE ABBEY, in DEVONSHIRE, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS your honoured father was pleased to make choice of me to answer in your name at the font, and to exercise a sort of <HI>guardianship</HI> over your spiritual interests; permit me, by putting these little treatises into your hand, to fulfil some part of that solemn obligation.</P>
<P><HI>Gratitude</HI> for many signal favours, and a conscientious regard to my sacred engagement, have long ago inspired my breast with the warmest wishes, both for your true <HI>dignity,</HI> and real <HI>happiness.</HI> Nor can I think of a more endearing, or a more effectual way, of advancing either the one or the other, than to set before you a sketch of your excellent <HI>father's</HI> character.—Illustrious examples are the most winning incitements to virtue. And none can come attended with such particular recommendations to YOU, Sir, as the pattern of that worthy person, from whom you derive your very being.</P>
<P>A most cordial, and reverential esteem for the <HI>Divine Word,</HI> was one of his remarkable qualities. Those, or∣cles of Heaven were his principal delight, and his insep∣arable
<PB N="6" REF="021885_0187_0FB5F2D9A78B94B8"/>
companions. Your gardens, your solitary walks, and the hedges of your fields, can witness,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Josh. xxiv.27.</NOTE> with what an unwearied assiduity he exercised himself in the law of the LORD. From hence he fetched his maxims of wisdom, and formed his judgment of things. The sacred <HI>precepts,</HI> were the model of his temper, and the guide of his life; while the precious <HI>promises</HI> were the joy of his heart, and his portion for ever.</P>
<P><HI>Improving company</HI> was another of his most relishing pleasures. Few gentlemen were better furnished, either with richness of fancy, or copiousness of expression, to bear a shining part in conversation. With these talents, he always endeavoured to give some <HI>useful,</HI> generally some <HI>religious,</HI> turn to the discourse. Nor did he ever reflect, with greater complacency on his social hours, than when they tended to glorify the Eternal Majesty; and to awaken, in himself and others, a more lively spir∣it of devotion.</P>
<P>To project for the good of others, was his frequent study; and to carry those benevolent contrivances into execution, his favourite employ. When visited by the young persons of the neighbourhood, far from taking an ungraceful pride to initiate them in debauchery, or con∣firm them in a riotous habit, it was his incessant aim, by finely adapted persuasives, to encourage them in <HI>in∣dustry,</HI> and establish them in a course of <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>briety;</HI> to <HI>guard</HI> them against the allurements of vice, and <HI>animate</HI> them with the principles of piety. A noble kind of hospi∣tality this! which will probably transmit its beneficial influence to their earthly possessions; to their future families; and even to their everlasting state.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="021885_0188_0FB5F2DB68C7CDD8"/>A conviction of human indigence, and a thorough persuasion of the divine all sufficiency, induced him to be <HI>frequent in prayer.</HI> To prostrate himself, in profound adoration, before that infinitely exalted being, who dwells in light inaccessible, was <HI>his glory;</HI> to implore the continuance of the Almighty favour, and the increase of all christian graces, was <HI>his gain.</HI> In those moments, no doubt, he remembered you, Sir, with a particular ear∣nestness; and lodged many an ardent petition in the court of Heaven, for his infant son. Cease not to sec∣ond them with your own devout supplications, that they may descend upon your head, "in the fulness of the blessings of the Gospel of peace."</P>
<P>To give their genuine lustre to all his other endow∣ments, he was careful to maintain an <HI>humble mind.</HI> Though his friends might admire his superiour abilities, or his acquaintance applaud his exemplary behaviour, he saw how far he <HI>fell short</HI> of the mark of his high call∣ing; saw, and lamented his defects; saw, and renounced himself; relying, for final acceptance, and endless felicity, on a <HI>better righteousness</HI> than his own; even on the tran∣scendently perfect righteousness, and inconceivably prec∣ious death, of JESUS the Redeemer. This was the rock of his hope, and the very crown of his rejoicing.</P>
<P>These, Sir, are some of the <HI>distinguished</HI> characteristicks of your deceased parent. As you had the misfortune to lose so valuable a relative, before you was capable of form∣ing any acquaintance with his person; I flatter myself, you will the more attentively observe his picture. This his <HI>moral picture</HI>; designed, not to be set in gold, or spar∣kle

in enamel, but to breathe in your spirit, and to live in all your conduct.—Which, though it be entirely your own, calculated purely for yourself, may possibly (like the family pieces in your parlour, that glance an eye upon as many as enter the room) make some <HI>pleasing and useful</HI> impression on every beholder.—May every one, charmed with the beautiful image, catch its resemblance; and each, in his respective sphere, "go and do likewise."</P>
<P>But you, Sir, are peculiarly concerned to copy the a∣miable original. As the order of an indulgent Providence has made you heir of the <HI>affluent circumstances</HI>; let not a gay and thoughtless inadvertence, cut you off from the <HI>richer inheritance</HI> of these noble qualifications.—These will be your security, amidst all the glittering dangers, which are inseparable from blooming years, and an ele∣vated situation in life. These are your path, your sure and only path, to true greatness, and solid happiness.— Tread in these steps, and you cannot fail to be the dar∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng or your friends, and the favourite of Heaven. Tread in these steps, and you will give inexpressible joy to one of the best of mothers; you will become an ex∣tensive blessing to your fellow creatures; and which, af∣ter such most engaging motives, is scarce worthy to be mentioned, you will be the delight, the honour, and the boast of,</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WE have already exercised out specula∣tion, on the tombs and flowers; surveying nature, covered with the deepest horrours, and arrayed in the richest beauties. <HI>Al∣legory</HI> taught many of the objects, to speak the language of vir∣tue; while <HI>imagination</HI> lent her colouring, to give the lessons an engaging air.—And this with a view of imitating that <HI>Divine</HI> Instructor, who commissioned the <HI>lily,</HI><NOTE N="* * *" PLACE="foot">Matt. vi.26, 28, 29, 30.</NOTE> in her silver suit, to re∣monstrate in the ear of unbelieving reason; who sent his disci∣ples (men ordained to <HI>teach</HI> the universe) to <HI>learn</HI> maxims of the last importance, from the most <HI>insignificant</HI> birds,<NOTE N="* * *" PLACE="foot">Matt. vi.26, 28, 29, 30.</NOTE> that wander through the paths of the air; from the very <HI>meanest</HI> herbs,<NOTE N="* * *" PLACE="foot">Matt. vi.26, 28, 29, 30.</NOTE> that are scattered over the face of the <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Celebrated writers, at <HI>Demosthenes</HI> and <HI>Cicero, Thucydides</HI> and <HI>Livy,</HI> are observed to have a style peculiar to themselves.—Now, whoever considers the discourses of <HI>Christ,</HI> will find him distinguishing himself by a style, which may properly be called <HI>HIS OWN.</HI> Majestick, yet familiar; happily uniting dignity with condescension; it consists, in teaching his followers the <HI>sublimest</HI> truths, by spiritualizing on the most <HI>common</HI> occur∣rences. Which, besides its being level to the lowest apprehensions; and admirably adapted to steal into the most inattentive heart; is accompanied with this very singular advantage, that it turns even the <HI>sphere of business</HI> into a <HI>school of instruction</HI>; and renders the most ordinary objects a set of monitors, ever soliciting our regard, because ever present to our senses.—So that I believe, it may be said of this <HI>amiable method,</HI> in which, our LORD conveyed, as well as of that <HI>powerful energy,</HI> which attended his doctrines, that <HI>never man spake like this man.</HI>—The <HI>harvest</HI> approaching, he reminds his disci∣ples of a far more important harvest, <HI>John</HI> iv.35. <HI>Matt.</HI> xiii.39. when immortal beings shall be <HI>reaped</HI> from the grave, and <HI>gathered in</HI> from all the quarters of the earth; when every human creature shall sustain the character of valuable <HI>wheat,</HI> or despicable <HI>tares</HI>; and accordingly be lodged in mansions of everlasting security, or consigned over to the rage of unquenchable fire.—In his charge to <HI>fishermen,</HI> when they are commencing preachers, <HI>Matt.</HI> iv.19, he exhorts them, conformably to the nature of their late occupation, to use the same <HI>assiduity</HI> and <HI>address</HI> in winning souls, as they were wont to exer∣cise in catching the finny prey.—For the farther illustration of this no less useful, than curious subject, I would refer my reader to a valuable note in Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>'s observations on the prophecies, p. 148.4 to edition.</NOTE> ground.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="021885_0191_0FB5F2E14CB831F0"/>Emboldened by the kind acceptance of the preceding sketches, I beg leave to confide in the same <HI>benevolence</HI> of <HI>taste,</HI> for the pro∣tection and support of the two remaining essays; which exhibit a prospect of <HI>still li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> and <HI>grand operation;</HI> which moralize on the most composed and most magnificent appearances of things:—In which, <HI>fancy</HI> is again suffered to introduce her imagery; but only as the handmaid of <HI>truth;</HI> in order to dress her person, and display her charms; to engage the attention, and win the love, even of the <HI>gay,</HI> and of the <HI>fashionable;</HI> which is more likely to be effected, by forming agreeable pictures of nature, and deriv∣ing instructive observations, than by the laborious method of long deduced arguments, or close connected reasonings.—The contemplation of the heavens and the earth, of their admirable properties and beneficial changes, has always afforded the most exalted gratification to the human mind. In compliance with this prevailing taste, I have drawn my serious admonitions from the stupendous theatre, and variegated scenery, of the universe; that the reader may learn his duty, from his very pleasures—may gather <HI>wisdom,</HI> mingled with <HI>virtue,</HI> from the most refined <HI>en∣tertainments,</HI> and noblest <HI>delights.</HI></P>

<Q><L>—Then is the time,</L>
<L>For those, whom wisdom, and whom nature charm,</L>
<L>To steal themselves from the degen'rate crowd,</L>
<L>And soar above this little scene of things;</L>

<L>To soothe the throbbing passions into peace;</L>

<P>The favour I would solicit for the <HI>first</HI> of the following com∣positions, is, that it may be permitted to attend, in such retired and contemplative excursions; to attend, if not under the char∣acter of a friend, at least, in the humble capacity of a servant, or a page;—as a <HI>servant,</HI> to open the door of meditation, and remove every impediment to those best exercises of the mind, which blend advantage with amusement, and improve while they delight;—as a <HI>page,</HI> to gather up the unstable, fluctuating train of fancy; and collect her fickle powers into a consistent, reg∣ular, and useful habit of thinking.</P>
<P>The <HI>other,</HI> conversant among the <HI>starry regions,</HI> would had the imagination through those beautiful tracts of unclouded azure; and point out to the judgment some of those astonishing particu∣lars, which so eminently signalize the celestial worlds. A prospect this, to which curiosity attracts our eyes, and to which scripture itself often directs our study, A prospect beyond all others most excellently calculated, to <HI>inlarge</HI> the soul, and <HI>ennoble</HI> its concep∣tions;—to give the grandest apprehensions of the <HI>everlasting</HI> GOD, and create sentiments of becoming superiority, with rela∣tion to all <HI>transitory</HI> interest; in a word, to farnish <HI>faith</HI> with the surest foundation for a steady affiance, and true magnanim∣ity of spirit; to afford <HI>piety</HI> the strongest motives, both for a lively gratitude, and profound veneration.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="021885_0193_0FB5F2ED08990108"/>While <HI>Galileo</HI> lifts his tube, and discovers the prodigious mag∣nitude of those radiant orbs;—while <HI>Newton</HI> measures their amazing distances, and unites the whole system, in harmonious order, by the subtle influences of attraction;—I would only, like the herald before that illustrious <HI>Hebrew,</HI><NOTE PLACE="foot">Gen. xli.4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> proclaim at every turn,

and, what is still more surprising, for the space of</HI> hundreds <HI>or</HI> thousands <HI>of years to come.—As this is a matter of fact, absolutely indisputable; it is also a very obvious, yet solid demonstration, that the principles of science, on which those calculations proceed, are not mere conjecture, or pre∣carious supposition; but have a</HI> real, <HI>a</HI> certain foundation, in the nature and constitution of things.</P>

<HEAD>HERVEY's CONTEMPLATIONS ON THE NIGHT.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE business of the day dispatched, and the sultry heats abated, invited me to the recreation of a walk. A walk, in one of the <HI>finest recesses</HI> of the country; and in one of the most <HI>pleasant evenings,</HI> which the summer season produced.</P>
<P>The limes and elms, uniting their branches over my head, formed a <HI>verdant canopy,</HI> and cast a most refreshing shade. Under my feet lay a <HI>carpet</HI> of nature's <HI>velvet</HI>; grass intermingled with moss, and embroidered with flowers. Jessamines, in conjunction with woodbines, twined around the trees; displaying their <HI>artless beau∣ties</HI> to the eye, and diffusing their <HI>delicious sweets</HI> through the air. On either side, the boughs, rounded into a set of regular arches, opened a view into the <HI>dis∣tant fields,</HI> and presented me with a prospect of the <HI>bend∣ing skies.</HI> The little birds, all joyous and grateful for the favours of the light, were paying their acknowledg∣ments in a <HI>tribute</HI> of <HI>harmony,</HI> and soothing themselves to rest with songs▪ while a French horn, from a neighbouring seat, sent its melodious accents, softened by the length of their passage, to complete the <HI>concert</HI> of the <HI>grove.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="021885_0199_0FB5F3B29844FF58"/>Roving in this agreeable manner, my thoughts were exercised on a subject still more agreeable than the sea∣son, or the scene. I mean, our late <HI>signal victory</HI> over the united forces of intestine treason, and foreign in∣vasion. A victory, which pours joy through the present age, and will transmit its influence to generations yet unborn.—Are not all the blessings, which can endear so∣ciety, or render life itself desirable, centred in our pres∣ent happy constitution, and auspicious government? Were they not <HI>all</HI> struck at, by that impious and horrid blow, meditated at <HI>Rome</HI>; levelled by <HI>France</HI>; and sec∣onded by factious spirits at <HI>home?</HI> Who then can be sufficiently thankful, for the gracious interposition of Providence; which has not only averted the impending ruin, but turned it, with aggravated confusion, on the authors of our troubles?</P>
<P>Methinks, every thing <HI>valuable,</HI> which I possess; every thing <HI>charming,</HI> which I behold; conspire to en∣hance this ever memorable event. To this it is owing, that I can ramble unmolested along the vale of private life, and taste all the innocent satisfactions of a <HI>contem∣plative</HI> retirement.—Had rebellion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Referring to the rebellion set on foot in the year 1745;— which, for several months, made a very alarming progress in the north—but was happily extinguished by the glorious and decisive vic∣tory at <HI>Culloden.</HI></NOTE> succeeded in her detestable designs, instead of walking with security and complacence in these flowery paths, I might have met the <HI>assassin</HI> with his <HI>dagger</HI>; or have been obliged to abandon my habitation, and
<Q>embrace the rock for a shelter.</Q>—Farewel then, ye fragrant shades; seats of meditation, and calm repose! I should have been driven from your loved retreats, to make way for some barba∣rous, some <HI>insulting victor.</HI>—Farewel then, ye pleasing toils, and wholesome amusements of my rural hours! I should no more have reared the tender flower to the sun; no more have taught the espalier to expand her boughs; nor have fetched, any longer, from my kitchen garden, the purest supplies of health.</P>
<P>Had rebellion succeeded in her detestable designs, instead of being regaled with the <HI>musick</HI> of the <HI>woods,</HI> I might have been alarmed with the sound of the trumpet,
<PB N="19" REF="021885_0200_0FB5F3B450C75190"/>
and all the thunder of war. Instead of being entertained with this <HI>beautiful landscape,</HI> I might have beheld our houses ransacked, and our villages plundered; I might have beheld our fenced cities encompassed with armies, and our fruitful fields "clothed with desolation;" or have been shocked with the more frightful images, of "garments rolled in blood," and of a ruffian's blade reeking from a brother's heart. Instead of peace, with her cheering olives, sheltering our abodes; instead of justice, with her impartial scale, securing our goods; <HI>persecution</HI> had brandished her sword, and <HI>slavery</HI> clanked her chains.</P>
<P>Nor are these miseries imaginary only, or the crea∣tures of a groundless panick. There are, in a neighbour∣ing kingdom, who very lately experienced them in all their rigour.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a pamphlet entitled, <HI>Popery always the same.</HI>—Which con∣tains a narrative of the <HI>persecutions</HI> and severe hardsh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ps, lately suffered by the <HI>Protestants,</HI> in the southern parts of <HI>France</HI>; and closes with a most seasonable, alarming, and spirited address to the inhabitants of <HI>Great britain.</HI> Printed 1746.</NOTE> And, if the <HI>malignant</HI> spirit of <HI>popery</HI> had forced itself into our church; if an <HI>abjured pretender</HI> had cut his way to our throne; we could have no rea∣son to expect a mitigation of their severity, on our be∣half.—But, supposing the tender mercies of a bigotted usurper to have been somewhat less cruel; where, alas! would have been the encouragement, to cultivate our little portion; or what pleasure could arise, from an im∣proved spot; if both the one and the other lay, every moment, at the mercy of <HI>lawless</HI> power? This imbit∣tering circumstance would spoil their relish; and by ren∣dering them a <HI>precarious,</HI> would render them a <HI>joyless</HI> ac∣quisition.—In vain might the vine spread her purple clusters; in vain be lavish of her generous juices; if <HI>tyranny,</HI> like a ravenous harpy, should be always hover∣ing over the bowl, and ready to snatch it from the lip of industry, or to wrest it from the hand of liberty.</P>
<P><HI>Liberty,</HI> that dearest of names; and <HI>property,</HI> that best of charters; give an additional, an inexpressible charm to every delightful object—See, how the declining sun has beautified the <HI>western clouds</HI>; has ar∣rayed them in crimson, and skirted them with gold. Such a refinement of our domestick bliss, is property;
<PB N="20" REF="021885_0201_0FB5F3B5AD3EA828"/>
such an improvement of our publick privileges, is liberty. —When the lamp of day shall withdraw his beams, there will still remain the same collection of floating va∣pours; but O! how changed, how gloomy! The car∣nation streaks are faded; the golden edgings are worn away; and all the lovely tinges are lost, in a <HI>leade<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> coloured louring</HI> sadness. <HI>Such</HI> would be the aspect of all these scenes of beauty, and all these abodes of pleas∣ure, if exposed continually to the caprice of arbitrary sway, or held in a state of abject and cringing depend∣ence.</P>
<P>The sun has almost finished his daily race, and hastens to the goal. He descends lower and lower, till his char∣iot wheels seem to hover on the utmost verge of the sky. What is somewhat remarkable, the orb of light, upon the point of setting, grows considerably <HI>broader.</HI> The shadows of objects, just before they become blended in undistinguishable darkness, are exceedingly <HI>lengthened.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Majoresque cadunt altis de montibus umbrae. <BIBL><HI>VIRG.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>
—Like blessings, little prized, while <HI>possessed,</HI> but highly esteemed, the very instant they are preparing for their flight, bitterly regretted when once they are gone, and to be seen no more.</P>
<P>The radiant globe is, now, half immersed beneath the dusky earth; or, as the ancient poets speak, is shooting into the ocean, and sinks in the western sea:— And could I view the <HI>sea,</HI> at this juncture, it would yield a most amusing and curious spectacle. The rays, striking horizontally on the liquid element, give it the appearance of floating glass; or, reflected in many a different direction, form a beautiful multiplicity of col∣ours.—A stranger, as he walks along the sandy beach, and, lost in pensive attention, listens to the murmurings of the restless flood, is agreeably alarmed by the <HI>gay dec∣orations</HI> of the surface: With entertainment, and with wonder he sees the curling waves, here glistering with white, there glowing with purple; in one place, wear∣ing an azure tincture; in another, glancing a cast of undulating green; in the whole, exhibiting a piece of <HI>fluid scenery,</HI> that may vie with yonder pensile tapestries, though wrought in the loom, and tinged with the dyes of Heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="021885_0202_0FB5F3BFA7C28B08"/>While I am transported by fancy to the shores of the ocean, the great luminary is sunk beneath the hori∣zon and totally disappears. The whole face of the ground is overspread with shades, or with what one of the finest painters of nature calls a <HI>dun obscurity.</HI> Only a few very superiour eminences are tipt with streaming silver. The tops of groves and lofty towers catch the <HI>last smiles</HI> of day,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this remarkable appearance delicately described, and wrought into a comparison, which, in my opinion, is one of the most just, beautiful and noble pieces of imagery to be found in modern poetry; <HI>Night Thoughts,</HI> No. 11.</NOTE> are still irradiated by the depart∣ing beams.—But, O! how transient is the distinction! how momentary the gift! Like all the blessings which mortals enjoy below, it is <HI>gone</HI> almost as soon as <HI>granted.</HI> See! how languishingly it trembles on the leafy spire, and glimmers, with a dying faintness, on the mountain's brow. The little vivacity that remains, decays every moment: It can no longer hold its station: While I speak it expires, and resigns the world to the gradual approaches of night.</P>

<P>Every object, a little while ago, glared with light; but now all appears under a more qualified lustre. The animals harmonize with the insensible creation; and what was <HI>gay</HI> in those, as well as <HI>glittering</HI> in this, gives place to an universal <HI>gravity.</HI> In the meadows all was jocund and sportive; but now the gamesome lambs are grown weary of their frolicks, and the tired shepherd has imposed silence on his pipe. In the branches all was sprightliness and song; but now the lively green is wrapt in the descending glooms, and no tuneful airs are heard, only the plaintive stockdove cooing mourn∣fully through the grove.—Should I now be vain and trifling, the heavens and the earth would rebuke my unseasonable levity. Therefore, be these moments de∣voted to thoughts <HI>sedate</HI> as the closing day, <HI>solemn</HI> as the face of things. And, indeed, however my social hours are enlivened with innocent pleasantry, let every e∣vening,
<PB N="22" REF="021885_0203_0FB5F3C0CFCA01E8"/>
in her sable habit, toll the bell to serious con∣sideration. Nothing can be more proper for a person who walks on the borders of eternity, and is hasting continually to his final audit; nothing more proper than daily to slip away from the circle of amusements, and frequently to relinquish the hurry of business, in order to consider and adjust
<Q>the things that belong to his peace.</Q></P>
<P>Since the sun is departed, from whence can it pro∣ceed that I am not involved in pitchy darkness? Whence these remainders of <HI>diminished brightness,</HI> which, though scarcely forming a refulgence, soften and soothe the hor∣rours of night? I see not the shining ruler, yet am cheer∣ed with a real, though faint communication of his splen∣dour.—Does he remember us in his progress through other climes? Does he send a <HI>detachment</HI> of his rays to <HI>escort</HI> us during his personal absence, or to <HI>cover</HI> (if I may use the military term) our <HI>retreat</HI> from the scene of action? Has he bequeathed us a dividend of his beams, sufficient to render our circumstances easy, and our situation agreeable, till sleep pours its soft oppres∣sion on the organs of sense; till sleep suspends all the operations of our hands, and entirely supersedes any far∣ther occasion for the light?</P>
<P>No: It is ill judged and unreasonable to ascribe this beneficent conduct to the sun. Not unto him, not un∣to him, but unto his <HI>Almighty Maker</HI> we are obliged for this pleasing attendant, this valuable legacy. The gracious Author of our being has so disposed the collec∣tion of circumambient air, as to make it productive of this fine and wonderful effect. The sunbeams, falling on the higher pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts of the aërial fluid, instead of passing on in straight lines, are bent inwards and conducted to our sight. Their natural course is overruled, and they are bidden to wheel about, on purpose to favour us with a welcome and salutary visit: By which means, the blessing of light and the season of business are consider∣ably prolonged: And, what is a very endearing circum∣stance, prolonged most considerably, when the vehe∣ment heats of summer incline the <HI>student</HI> to postpone his walk till the temperate evening prevails; when the im∣portant
<PB N="23" REF="021885_0204_0FB5F3C261191560"/>
labours of the harvest call the <HI>husbandman</HI> abroad, before the day is fully risen.</P>
<P>After all the ardours of the sultry day, how reviving is this <HI>coolness!</HI>—This gives new verdure to the fading plants, new vivacity to the withering flowers, and a more exquisite fragrance to their mingled scents.—By this the <HI>air</HI> also receives a new force, and is qualified to exert itself with greater activity; qualified to brace our limbs, to heave our lungs, and cooperate, with a brisker impulse, in perpetuating the circulation of our blood.— This I might call the grand <HI>alembick</HI> of nature, which distils her most sovereign <HI>cordial,</HI> the refreshing <HI>dews.</HI> Incessant heat would rob us of their beneficial agency, and oblige them to evaporate in imperceptible exhala∣tions. Turbulent winds, or even the gentler motions of <HI>Aurora</HI>'s fan, would dissipate the rising vapours, and not suffer them to form a coalition: But, favoured by the stillness, and condensed by the coolness of the night, they unite in pearly drops, and create that <HI>finely tempered</HI> humidity which cheers the vegetable world, as sleep ex∣hilarates the animal.</P>
<P>Not unlike to these are the advantages of <HI>solitude.</HI> The world is a troubled ocean; and who can erect sta∣ble purposes on its fluctuating waves? The world is a school of wrong; and who does not feel himself warp∣ing to its pernicious influences?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nunquam a turba m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>res, quos extuli, refer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

Some sacred <HI>truth,</HI> which was struck in lively characters on our souls, is obscured if not obliterated. Some worthy <HI>reso∣lution,</HI> which Heaven had wrought in our breasts, is shaken if not overthrown. Some inticing <HI>vanity,</HI> which we had solemnly renounced, again practises its wiles, and again captivates our affections. How often has an un∣wary glance kindled a fever of irregular desire in our hearts? How often has a word of applause dropt lus∣cious poison into our ears; or some disrespectful ex∣pression raised a gust of passion in our bosoms? Our
<PB N="24" REF="021885_0205_0FB5F3C3CC6078E8"/>
innocence is of so <HI>tender</HI> a constitution, that it suffers in the promiscuous crowd. Our purity is of so <HI>delicate</HI> a complexion, that it scarce touches on the world without contracting a stain. We see, we hear, with peril.</P>
<P>But here <HI>safety</HI> dwells. Every meddling and intru∣sive avocation is secluded. Silence holds the door a∣gainst the strife of tongues, and all the impertinences of idle conversation. The busy swarm of vain images, and cajoling temptations which beset us, with a buzzing im∣portunity, amidst the gaieties of life, are chased by these thickening shades.—Here I may, without disturbance, commune with my own heart, and learn that best of sciences, to <HI>know myself.</HI> Here the soul may rally her dissipated powers, and grace recover its native energy. This is the opportunity to rectify every evil impression, to expel the poison, and guard against the contagion of corrupting examples. This is the place where I may, with advantage, apply myself to subdue the <HI>rebel within,</HI> and be master, not of a sceptre, but of myself.—Throng then, ye ambitious, the levees of the powerful; I will be punctual in my assignations with solitude. To a mind intent upon its own improvement, solitude has charms incomparably more engaging than the <HI>entertain∣ments</HI> presented in the theatre, or the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onours</HI> conferred in the drawing room.</P>
<P>I said, solitude.—Am I then <HI>alone?</HI>—'Tis true my acquaintance are at a distance. I have stole away from company, and am remote from all <HI>human</HI> observation. But that is an alarming thought,
<Q><L>Millions of <HI>spiritual</HI> creatures walk the earth,</L>

<P>Perhaps there may be numbers of those <HI>invisible be∣ings</HI> patrolling this same retreat, and joining with me in contemplating the Creator's works. Perhaps those <HI>ministering spirits,</HI> who rejoice at the conversion of a sinner, and hold up the goings of the righteous, may fol∣low us to the lonely recess, and, even in our most soli∣tary moments, be our constant <HI>attendants.</HI>—What a pleas∣ing awe is awakened by such a reflection! How vene∣rable
<PB N="25" REF="021885_0206_0FB5F3CDDD4360F8"/>
it renders my retired walks! I am struck with reverence as under the roof of some <HI>sacred edifice,</HI> or in the <HI>presence chamber</HI> of some mighty monarch. O! may I never bring any pride of imagination, nor indulge the least dissolute affection, where such refined and exalted intelligences exercise their watch!</P>
<P>'Tis possible that I am encompassed with such a cloud of witnesses; but it is certain that GOD, the <HI>infinite eter∣nal</HI> GOD, is now and ever with me. The great JEHO∣VAH, before whom all the angelick armies bow their heads and veil their faces, surrounds me, supports me, pervades me.
<Q>In HIM I live, move, and have my being.</Q>—The whole world is his august temple, and, in the most sequestered corner, I appear before his a∣dorable majesty, no less than when I worship in his house, or kneel at his altar. In every place, therefore, let me pay him the homage of a heart cleansed from idols, and devoted to his service. In every circumstance, let me feel no <HI>ambition</HI> but to <HI>please</HI> him, nor covet any <HI>happiness</HI> but to <HI>enjoy</HI> him.</P>
<P>How sublime is the description, and how striking the sentiment in that noble passage of the psalms! <HI>Whither shall I go from thy spirit, or whither shall flee from thy pres∣ence?

Life and activity exerted themselves in a thousand busy forms: The city swarmed with passing and repassing multitudes: All the country was sweat and dust: The air floated in perpetual agitation, by the flitting birds, and humming bees. <HI>Art</HI> sat prying with her piercing eyes; while industry plied her restless hands.—But see,
<PB N="32" REF="021885_0213_0FB5F3DF90800F60"/>
how all this fervent and impetuous bustle is fled with the setting sun. The beasts are slunk to their grassy couch; and the winged people are retired to their downy nests. The hammer has resigned its sounding task, and the file ceases to repeat its flying touches. Shut is the well frequented shop, and its threshold no longer worn by the feet of numerous customers. The village swain lies drowned in slumbers, and even his trusty dog, who, for a considerable time stood centry at the door, is extended at his ease, and snores with his master.—In every place <HI>toil</HI> reclines her head, and <HI>ap∣plication</HI> folds her arms.

But then his strength fails, his spirits flag, and he stands in need, not only of some respite from toil, but of some kindly and sovereign re∣freshments.—What an admirable provision for this pur∣pose is <HI>sleep!</HI> Sleep introduces a most welcome vacation, both for the soul and the body. The exercises of the brain, and the labours of the hand, are at once discontinued. So that the weary limbs repair their exhausted vigour, while the <HI>pensive</HI> thoughts drop their load of sorrows, and the <HI>busy</HI> ones rest from their fatigue of application.—Most reviving cordial! Equally beneficial to our animal and intellectual powers. It supples the fleshy machine, and keeps all its nice movements in a proper posture for easy play. It animates the thinking faculties with fresh alac∣rity, and rekindles their ardour for the studies of the dawn.

How many, sick with <HI>dis∣quietude,</HI> and restless, even on their downy pillows, would purchase this transient oblivion of their woes, almost at any rate!—That which wealth cannot procure, which multitudes sigh for in vain, thy GOD has bestowed on thee, times out of number.

<P>Since sleep is so absolutely necessary, so inestimably valuable, observe, what a <HI>fine apparatus</HI> Almighty Good∣ness has made, to accommodate us with the balmy bless∣ing.

<P><HI>Reason</HI> now resigns her sedate office, and <HI>fancy,</HI> extravagant fancy, leads the mind through a maze of vanity.

Others, quite insensible of their rooms of state, are mourning in a doleful <HI>dungeon,</HI> or struggling with the raging billows: Perhaps, with hasty steps, they climb the craggy cliff; and, with real anxiety, fly from the imaginary danger: Or else, be∣numbed with sudden fear, and finding themselves unable to escape, they give up at once their hopes and their efforts; and, though reclined on a couch of ivory, are sinking, all helpless and distressed, in the furious whirl∣pool.

<P>But is this the only season when absurd and incoherent irregularities play their magick on our minds?

and no longer be imposed upon by fantastick appearances, which, however <HI>pompous</HI> they may seem, will prove more <HI>empty</HI> than the visions of the night, more <HI>transient</HI> than the dream that is forgotten.</P>
<P>Having mentioned sleep and dreams, let me once again consider those remarkable incidents of our frame; so very remarkable, that I may venture to call them a kind of experimental <HI>mystery,</HI> and little less than a stand∣ing <HI>miracle.</HI>—Behold the most <HI>vigorous constitution,</HI> when stretched on the bed of ease, and totally resigned to the slumbers of the night. Its activity is oppressed with fetters of indolence; its strength is consigned over to a temporary annihilation; the nerves are like a bow un∣strung, and the whole animal system is like a motionless log.—Behold a person of the most <HI>delicate sensations,</HI> and <HI>amiable dispositions.</HI> His eyes, though thrown wide open, admit not the visual ray; at least, distinguish not ob∣jects. His ears, with the organs unimpaired, and artic∣ulate accents beating upon the drum, perceive not the sound; at least, apprehend not the meaning. The senses, and their exquisitely fine feelings, are overwhelmed with an unaccountable stupefaction. You call him a <HI>social</HI> creature; but where are his social affections? He knows not the father that begat him, and takes no notice of the friend that is as his own soul. The wife of his bosom may expire by his side, and he lie more uncon∣cerned than a barbarian. The children of his body, may be tortured with the severest pangs, and he, even in the same chamber, remain untouched with the least commiseration.—Behold the most <HI>ingenious scholar,</HI> whose judgment is piercing, and able to trace the most intricate difficulties of science; his taste refined, and quick to relish all the beauties of sentiment and composition: Yet, at this juncture, the thinking faculties are unhing∣ed, and the intellectual economy quite disconcerted. In∣stead of close connected reasonings, nothing but a dis∣jointed huddle of absurd ideas; instead of well digested principles, nothing but a disorderly jumble of crude con∣ceptions. The most palpable delusions impose upon his imagination. The whole night passes, and he fre∣quently
<PB N="46" REF="021885_0227_0FB5F413027103E8"/>
mistakes it for a single minute; is not sensible of the transition, hardly sensible of any duration.</P>
<P>Yet, no sooner does the morning dawn, and day∣light enter the room, but this strange enchantment van∣ishes. The man awakes, and finds himself <HI>possessed</HI> of all the valuable endowments, which, for several hours, were suspended, or lost. His sinews are braced, and fit for action. His senses are alert and keen. The roman∣tick visionary brightens into the master of reason. The frozen or benumbed affections, melt with tenderness, and glow with benevolence. And, what is beyond meas∣ure surprising, the intoxicated mind works itself sober, not by <HI>slow degrees</HI>; but, in the <HI>twinkling</HI> of an eye, recovers from its perturbation.—Why does not the stu∣por, which deadens all the nice operations of the animal powers, hold fast its possession? When the thoughts are once disadjusted, why are they not always in confusion? How is it, that they are rallied in a moment, and, from the wildest irregularity, reduced to the most orderly ar∣ray?—From an inactivity, resembling death, how is the body so <HI>suddenly</HI> restored to vigour and agility? From extravagances bordering upon madness, how is the understanding <HI>instantaneously</HI> reestablished in sedateness and harmony?—Surely,
<Q>this is the LORD's doing, and it should be marvellous in our eyes;</Q>
should awaken our gratitude, and inspirit our praise.</P>
<P>This is the time in which <HI>ghosts</HI> are supposed to make their appearance. Now the <HI>timorous imagination</HI> teems with phantoms, and creates numberless terrours to itself.

He does not mention <HI>dreams,</HI> though <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>somnia,</HI> would have suited the verse (if the book be in metre) altogether as well as <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>visiones.</HI>—It could not surely be a <HI>wind,</HI> as some translate the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; because, the circum∣stance of <HI>standing still,</HI> is not so compatible with the nature of a wind; and a wind would have passed <HI>above</HI> him, all <HI>around</HI> him, as well as <HI>before</HI> him. Not to add, how low a remark it is, and how unworthy of a place in so august a description, that he <HI>could not discern the form</HI> of a wind.—It seems, therefore, to have been a real spirit; either <HI>angelical</HI> as were those, which presented themselves to <HI>Abraham</HI> resting at the door of his tent, and to <HI>Lot</HI> sitting in the gate of <HI>Sodom</HI>; or else, the spirit of some <HI>departed saint,</HI> as in the case of <HI>Samuel</HI>'s apparition, or the famous appearance of <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Elijah</HI> on the mount of transfiguration.—A spirit, assuming some <HI>vehicle,</HI> in order to become visible to the human eye; which, accordingly, <HI>Eliphaz</HI> saw, exhibiting itself as an object of sight: But saw so ob∣scurely and indistinctly, that he was not able, either to describe its <HI>aspect,</HI> or to discern <HI>whom</HI> it resembled.</NOTE> on some <HI>very extraordinary</HI> emergences; while it discountenances those legions of idle tales, which superstition has raised, and credulity received. Since it teaches us, that if, at any time, those visitants from the unknown world, render themselves perceivable by mortals, it is not upon any errand of frivolous conse∣quence;

<P>'Twas in the <HI>dead of night.</HI> All nature lay shrouded in darkness. Every creature was buried in sleep. The most profound silence reigned through the universe. In these solemn moments, <HI>Eliphaz</HI> alone, all wakeful and solitary, was musing upon sublime and heavenly subjects. —When, lo! an awful being from the invisible realms, burst into his apartment.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have given this solemn picture a <HI>modern</HI> dress, rather for the sake of variety and illustration, than from any apprehension of im∣proving the admirable original. Such an attempt, I am sensible; would be more absurdly vain, than to lacquer gold, or paint the diamond. The description, in <HI>Eliphaz</HI>'s own language, is awful and affecting to the last degree. A <HI>night piece,</HI> dressed in all the cir∣cumstances of the deepest horrour. I question, whether <HI>Shakespeare</HI> him∣self, though so peculiarly happy for his great command of terrifying images, has any thing superiour or comparable to this.

It made a solemn pause, to prepare his mind for some momentous message.—Af∣ter which a voice was heard; a voice, for the import∣ance of its meaning, worthy to be had in everlasting re∣membrance; for the solemnity of its delivery, enough to alarm a heart of stone. It spoke; and this was the purport of its words—

Not, <HI>Shall man be more just than GOD?</HI> But, <HI>Shall man be just before,</HI> or <HI>in the sight of GOD?</HI> The passage, thus rendered, speaks a truth incomparably more weighty, and needful to be inculcated: A truth, exactly parallel to that humbling confession of the prophet, <HI>We are all as an unclean thing</HI>; and to that solemn declaration of the psalmist, <HI>In thy sight shall no man living be justified.</HI></NOTE>

The crowds that flock together, instead of diminishing, in∣crease the dread. They catch contagion from each other's looks and words; while fear is in every eye, and every tongue speaks the language of terrour. Some see <HI>hideous shapes</HI>; armies mixed in fierce encounter, or fields swimming with blood.

You was pleased with the lovely visitants that brought beauty on their wings, and melody in their throats. But could you insure the <HI>continuance</HI> of this agreeable entertain∣ment? No, truly. At the least disturbing noise, at the least terrifying appearance, they start from their seats; they mount the skies; and are gone in an instant, are gone forever. Would you choose to have a happiness which bears date with their arrival, and expires at their departure? If you could not be content with a portion, enjoyable only through such a <HI>fortuitous term,</HI> not of years, but of moments, O! take up with nothing earth∣ly; set your affections on things above; there alone is "no variableness or shadow of turning."</P>
<P><HI>Job</HI> is not a more illustrious pattern of patience, than an eminent exemplification of this remark.—View him in his <HI>private estate.</HI> He heaps up silver as the

<Q>a very great household.</Q>
—Never was human felicity so con∣summate; never was <HI>disastrous revolution</HI> so sudden. The lightning which consumed his cattle, was not more terrible, and scarce more instantaneous. The joyful parent is bereft of his offspring, and his

The man of affluence is stripped of his abundance; and he who was clothed in scarlet em∣braces the dunghill. The venerable patriarch is the derision of scoundrels; and the late darling of an in∣dulgent Providence, is become

—Nor need we go back to former ages for proofs of this afflicting truth. In our times, in all times, the wheel continues the same in∣cessant whirl.

<P>Methinks, in this ever varying sphere, I see a representation, not only of our temporal advantages, but also of our <HI>spiritual accomplishments.</HI> Such, I am sure, is what the kind partiality of a friend would call <HI>my righteousness:</HI> And such, I am apt to suspect,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I would not be understood, as measuring, in this respect, <HI>others</HI> by <HI>myself</HI>; but as taking my estimate, from the unerring standard of scripture.

<Q>there is not a <HI>just</HI> man upon earth, that doeth good, and <HI>sinneth not,</HI></Q>
says the spirit of inspiration by <HI>Solomon (Eccles.</HI> vii 20.) —Nay, such is the purity, and so extensive are the demands of the divine law, that an apostle makes a still more humbling acknowl∣edgment; "in <HI>many</HI> things we offend <HI>all." (James</HI> iii.2)— And the unerring teacher, who most thoroughly knew our frame, directs the most advanced, most astablished, and most watchful chris∣tians, to pray daily for the forgiveness of their <HI>daily trespasses.</HI>—To which testimonies, I beg leave to add an elegant passage from the <HI>Canticles</HI>; because it not only expresses the sentiment of this paragraph, but illustrates it by the very same similitude. <HI>She</HI> (the church) <HI>is fair as the moon; clear as the sun.</HI> Fair as the moon, the lesser and changeable light, in her <HI>sanctification:</HI> Clear as the sun, the greater and invariable luminary, in her <HI>justification.</HI> The inherent holiness of believers being imperfect, and subject to many inequalities, while their imputed righteousness is every way complete, and constantly like itself. <HI>Cant.</HI> vi.10.</NOTE> is the righteousness of every man living. Now we exercise it, in some few instances, in some little degrees. Anon sin revives, and leads our souls into a transient, though unwilling captivity. Now we are <HI>meek</HI>; but soon a ruf∣fling accident intervenes, and turns our composure into a fretful disquietude. Now we are <HI>humble</HI>; soon we reflect upon some inconsiderable or imaginary superiority over others, and a sudden elatement swells our minds. Now, perhaps we possess a clean heart, and are warm with holy love. But O! how easily is the purity of our affections sullied; how soon the fervour of our gratitude cooled! And is their not something amiss, even in our

best moments? Something to be <HI>ashamed</HI> of, in all we <HI>are;</HI> something to be <HI>repented</HI> of, in all we <HI>do?</HI></P>
<P>With what gladness, therefore, and adoring thank∣fulness, should we

and <HI>receive,</HI> as a divine gift, what cannot be <HI>acquired</HI> by human works!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. v.17.—x.3.</NOTE> A writer of the first distinction, and nicest discernment, styles the obedience of our glorious surety, an <HI>everlasting right∣eousness</HI>;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dan. ix.24.</NOTE> such as was subject to no interruption, nor obscured by the least blemish; but proceeded always i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the same uniform tenour of the most spotless perfec∣tion.—This righteousness, in another sense, answers the prophet's exalted description, as its beneficial and sove∣reign efficacy knows no end; but lasts through all our life; lasts in the trying hour of death; lasts at the de∣cisive day of judgment; lasts through every generation; and will last to all eternity.</P>
<P>Sometimes I have seen that resplendent globe <HI>stripped</HI> of her <HI>radiance</HI>; or, according to the emphatical language of scripture, "turned into blood." The earth, interposing with its opake body, intercepted the solar rays, and cast its own gloomy shadow on the moon. The malignant influence gained upon her sickening orb; extinguished, more and more, the feeble remainders of light; till at length, like one in a <HI>deep swoon,</HI> no come∣liness was left in her countenance; she was totally over∣spread with darkness.—At this juncture, what a multi∣tude of eyes were gazing upon the rueful spectacle! Even of those eyes, which disregarded the empress of the night, or beheld her with indifference, when, robed in glory, and riding in her triumphal chariot, she shed a softer day through the nations. But now, under these circumstances of disgrace, they watch her motions with the most <HI>prying attention.</HI> In every place, her misfor∣tune is the object of general observation; and the pre∣vailing topick of discourse, in every company.</P>
<P>Is it not thus with regard to <HI>persons</HI> of <HI>eminence,</HI> in their respective spheres? Kings, at the head of their subjects; nobles, surrounded with their dependents; and (after names of so much grandeur, may I be allowed
<PB N="73" REF="021885_0254_0FB5F46D74F6FD90"/>
to add?) ministers labouring among their people,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill, cannot be hid. <BIBL><HI>Matt. v.14.</HI></BIBL></NOTE> are each in a conspicuous station. Their conduct in its <HI>minutest</HI> step, especially in any <HI>miscarriage,</HI> will be nar∣rowly surveyed, and critically scanned. Can their be a louder call to ponder the paths of their feet, and to be particularly jealous over all their ways?—Those who move in inferiour life, may grossly offend, and little alarm be given, perhaps no notice taken. But it is not to be expected, that the least slip in their carriage, the least flaw in their character, will pass undiscovered. <HI>Malice,</HI> with her eagle eyes, will be sure to discern them; while <HI>censure,</HI> with her shrill trumpet, will be as far from concealing them, as <HI>calumny,</HI> with her treacher∣ous whispers, from extenuating them. A planet may sink below the horizon; or a star, for several months, withdraw its shining; and scarce one in ten thousand perceive the loss. But, if the moon suffers a transient eclipse, almost half the world are spectators of her dishonour.</P>
<P>Very different was the case, when, at this late hour, I have taken a solitary walk on the <HI>western cliffs.</HI> At the foot of the steep mountain, the sea, all clear and smooth, spread itself into an immense plain, and held a watery mirror to the skies. Infinite heights above, the firmament stretched its azure expanse, bespangled with unnumbered stars, and adorned with the moon,
<Q>walk∣ing in brightness.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Job xxxi.26.</NOTE></Q>
She seemed to contemplate her∣self, with a peculiar pleasure; while the <HI>transparent sur∣face,</HI> both received and returned her <HI>silver image.</HI> Here, instead of being covered with sackcloth, she shone with double lustre; or rather, with a lustre multiplied in proportion to the number of beholders, and their various situations.</P>
<P>Such, methinks, is the effect of an exemplary be∣haviour, in persons of exalted rank. Their course, as it is nobly distinguished, so it will be happily <HI>influen∣tial.</HI> Others will catch the diffusive ray; and be ambi∣tious to resemble a pattern so attracting, so commanding. Their amiable qualities will not terminate in them∣selves;
<PB N="74" REF="021885_0255_0FB5F478863AF880"/>
but we shall see them <HI>reflected</HI> from their families, their acquaintance, their retainers: Just as we may now behold another moon, trembling <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><L>Splendet tremulo sub Lumine Pontus.</L>
<BIBL><HI>VIRG.</HI></BIBL></NOTE> in the stream, glittering in the canal, and displaying its lovely im∣press, on every collection of waters.</P>
<P>The moon, philosophy says, is a sort of <HI>sovereign</HI> over the <HI>great deep.</HI> Her orb, like a royal sceptre, sways the ocean, and actuates the fluid realms. It swells the tides, and perpetuates the reciprocal returns of ebb and flow. By which means, the liquid element purges off its filth, and is preserved from being putre∣fied itself, and from poisoning the world.—Is the moon thus <HI>operative</HI> on the vast abyss? And shall not the faith of eternal and infinite delights to come, be equally effi∣cacious on this soul of mine?—Far above her argent fields, are treasures of <HI>happiness,</HI> unseen by mortal eye, by mortal ear unheard, and unconceived by any human imagination. In that desira<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le world, the most dis∣tinguished and exalted <HI>hono<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> also are conferred; in comparison with which, the thrones and diadems of earthly monarchs, are empty pageants, and childish toys.—Yonder arch of sapphire, with all its spangles of gold, is but the floor of those divine abodes. What then are the apartments; what is the palace? How bright with glories; how rich with bliss?</P>
<P>O! ye mansions of blessedness; ye beauties of my Father's kingdom; which far outshine these lamps of the visible heaven; transmit your sweet and winning in∣vitations to my heart. <HI>Attract</HI> and <HI>refine</HI> all my affec∣tions. Withdraw them from <HI>stagnating</HI> on the sordid shores of flesh; never suffer them to settle upon the impure lees of sense; but impress them with <HI>emotions</HI> of restless desire after sublime and celestial joys:—Joys that will proceed, still proceed in a copious and everlast∣ing flow, when seas shall cease to roll:—Joys, that will charm every faculty with unimaginable pleasure, when the moon, with her waxing splendours, shall cheer our sight no more.</P>
<P>Enough for the present evening. My thoughts have been sufficiently exercised, and my steps begin to
<PB N="75" REF="021885_0256_0FB5F47B8AE3CFB0"/>
be attended with weariness. Let me obey the admoni∣tion of nature, and give respite to my meditations, slumber to my eyes.—But stay.—Shall I retire to the bed of sleep, with as little ceremony, and with as much in∣attention as the brutes to their sordid lairs? Are no <HI>ac∣knowledgments</HI> due to that Divine Being, who is the sup∣port of my life, and the length of my days? Have I no farther need of his <HI>protecting</HI> care; no more occa∣sion for the blessings of his goodness?—<HI>Lepidus,</HI> per∣haps, may laugh at the bended knee, and have a thou∣sand darts of raillery ready to discharge on the practice of devotion. The wits, I know, are unmercifully se∣vere on what <HI>they</HI> call the drudgery of prayer, and the fantastical rant of praise. These they leave to the illit∣erate labourer, and the mean machanick; or treat them, with a contemptuous sneer, as the parson's ignoble trade.</P>
<P>Is it then an instance of <HI>surperstitious</HI> blindness, to dis∣tinguish; or of <HI>whimsical</HI> zeal, to celebrate, the most supereminent excellency and merit? Is it an <HI>ungraceful</HI> business, or does it argue a <HI>grovelling</HI> disposition, to magnify goodness transcendently rich and diffusive?— What can be so truly becoming a <HI>dependent state,</HI> as to pay our adoring homage to the Author of all perfection, and profess our devoted allegiance to the Supreme Almighty Governour of the universe?—Can any thing more significantly bespeak an <HI>ingenuous temper,</HI> or adminis∣ter a more real satisfaction to its finest feelings, than the exercises of penitential devotion: By which we give vent to an honest anguish, or melt into filial sorrows, for our insensibility to the best of friends, for our dis∣obedience to the best of parents?—In a word, can there be a more <HI>sublime pleasure,</HI> than to dwell, in fixed con∣templation, on the beauties of the Eternal Mind; the ami∣able Original of all that is fair, grand, and harmonious; the beneficent Giver of all that is convenient, comforta∣ble, and useful?—Can there be a more <HI>advantageous em∣ploy,</HI> than to present our requests to the Father of mercies; opening our minds to the irradiation of his wisdom, and all the faculties of our souls to the communications of his grace?—It is strange, unaccountably strange, that the notion of <HI>dignity</HI> in sentiment, and the pursuit of
<PB N="76" REF="021885_0257_0FB5F47ED030BAC8"/>
<HI>refined</HI> enjoyment, should ever be disunited from devo∣tion: That persons who make pretensions to an im∣proved taste, and exalted genius, should neglect this most ennobling intercourse with the wisest and best of beings, the inexhaustible source of honour and joy.</P>
<P>Shall I be deterred from approaching this source of the purest delight? Deterred from pursuing this highest improvement of my nature? Deterred from all by a <HI>formidable</HI> banter, or confuted by one <HI>irrefragable</HI> smile?—No: Let the moon, in her resplendent sphere; and yonder pole, with all its starry train; witness, if I be silent even or morn; if I refrain to kindle in my heart and breathe from my lips, the reasonable incense of praise. Praise to that great and glorious GOD, who formed the earth, and built the skies; who poured from his hand the watery world, and shed the all surround∣ing air abroad.—
<Q>Thou also madest the night, Maker omnipotent! and thou, the day! which I, though less than the least of all thy mercies, have passed in safety, tranquillity, and comfort.—When I was lost in the extravagance of dreams, or lay immersed in the insensibility of sleep, thy hand recovered me from the temporary lethargy: Thy hand set a new, a delicately fine edge, on all my blunted <HI>senses</HI>; and strung my sinews with recruited vigour. When my thoughts were benumbed and stupefied, thy quickening influence roused them into activity; when they were disconcerted and wild, thy regulating influence re∣duced them into order: Refitted me at once to rel∣ish the innocent entertainments of an <HI>animal,</HI> and to enjoy the sublime gratifications of a <HI>rational</HI> capaci∣ty: When darkness covered the creation, at thy command, the <HI>sun</HI> arose; painted the flowers, and distinguished every object; gave light to my feet, and gave nature, with all her beautiful scenes, to my eye.—To thee, O thou GOD of my strength, I owe the <HI>continuance</HI> of my being, and the <HI>vivacity</HI> of my constitution. By thy sacred order, without any consciousness of mine, the wheels of life move, and the crimson fountain plays. <HI>Overruled</HI> by thy exquisite <HI>skill,</HI> it transforms itself, by the nicest opera∣tions of an inexplicable kind of chymistry, into a
<PB N="77" REF="021885_0258_0FB5F4801A596C20"/>
variety of the finest secretions; which glide into the muscles, and swell them for action; or pour them∣selves into the fluids, and repair the incessant decays; which cause cheerfulness to sparkle in the eye, and health to bloom in the cheek.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Disastrous accidents,</HI> injurious to the peace of my mind, or fatal to the welfare of my body, beset my paths. But thy faithfulness and truth, like an im∣penetrable shield, guarded me all around. Under this divine protection, I walked secure, amidst legions of <HI>apparant</HI> perils; and passed unhurt through a far greater multiplicity of unseen evils. Not one of my bones was broken; not a single shaft grazed upon my ease; even when the eye that watched over me, saw, in its wide survey, <HI>thousands falling beside me,</HI> in ir∣recoverable ruin; <HI>and ten thousands</HI> deeply wounded, <HI>on my right hand.</HI>—If sickness has, at any time, sad∣dened my chamber, or pain harrowed my flesh, it was a <HI>wholesome</HI> discipline, and a <HI>gracious</HI> severity. The chastisement proved a sovereign medicine, to cure me of an immoderate fondness, for this imper∣fect troublesome state; and to quicken my desires, after the unembittered enjoyments of my eternal home. —Has not thy munificence, unwearied and unbound∣ed, spread my <HI>table</HI>; and furnished it with the finest wheat; replenished it with marrow and fatness? While temperance sweetened the bowl; appetite sea∣soned the dish; contentment and gratitude crowned the repast.—Has not thy kindness, O GOD of the families of <HI>Israel!</HI> preserved my affectionate <HI>relations</HI>; who study, by their tender offices, to soften every care, and heighten every joy? Has not thy kindness given me valuable <HI>friends</HI>; whose presence is a cordial to cheer me in a dejected hour; and whose conversa∣tion mingles improvement with delight?</Q></P>
<P><Q>When sin lay disguised amidst flowery scenes of pleasure; enlightened by thy wisdom, I <HI>discerned</HI> the latent mischief; made resolute by thy grace, I <HI>shunned</HI> the luscious bane. If, through the impulse of sensuali∣ty, or the violence of passion, I have been hurried into the snare, and stung by the serpent, thy faithful admonitions have <HI>recalled</HI> the foolish wanderer;
<PB N="78" REF="021885_0259_0FB5F481914C63F8"/>
while the blood of thy Son has healed his deadly wounds.—Some, no doubt, have been cut off in the midst of their iniquities, and transmitted from the thrillings of polluted joy, to the agonies of eternal despair. Whereas I have been distinguished by long-suffering mercy; and, instead of lifting up my eyes in torments, to behold a heaven irrecoverably lost, I may lift them up under the pleasing views of being admitted, ere long, into those abodes of endless felic∣ity.—In the mean time, thou hast vouchsafed me the <HI>revelation</HI> of thy will; the influences of thy <HI>spirit</HI>; and abundance of the most effectual <HI>aids,</HI> for advanc∣ing in knowledge, and growing in godliness; for becoming more conformable to thy image, and more meet for thy presence; for tasting the pleasures of re∣ligion, and securing the riches of eternity.</Q></P>
<P><Q>How various is thy benificence, O thou Lover of souls! It has unsealed a thousand sources of good; opened a thousand avenues of delight; and heap∣ed blessings upon me, with a ceaseless liberality. If I should attempt to declare them, they would be more than the <HI>starry</HI> host, which glitter in this unclouded sky; more than the <HI>dewy</HI> gems, which will adorn the face of the morning.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And shall I <HI>forget</HI> the GOD of my salvation, the Author of all my mercies? Rather let my pulse for∣get to beat!—Shall I render Him <HI>no</HI> expressions of thankfulness? Then might all nature reproach my ingratitude.—Shall I rest satisfied with the <HI>bare</HI> ac∣knowledgment of my lips? No: Let my life be vocal, and speak his praise, in that only genuine, that most emphatical language—the language of devout obe∣dience. Let the <HI>bill</HI> be drawn upon my very heart; let all my affections <HI>acknowledge</HI> the draught; and let the whole tenour of my actions, in time and through eternity, be continually <HI>paying</HI> the debt—the ever pleasing, ever growing debt of duty, veneration, and love.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And can I, O thou Guide of my goings, and Guard∣ian of all my interests—can I <HI>distrust</HI> such signal, such experienced goodness? <HI>Thou hast been my helper,</HI> through all the busy scenes of day, <HI>therefore, under the
<PB N="79" REF="021885_0260_0FB5F48861F1CDD8"/>
shadow of thy wings</HI> will I repose myself, during the darkness, the danger, and deathlike inactivity of the night. Whatever defilement I have contracted, wash it thoroughly away, in redeeming blood; and let neither the sinful stain, nor the sinful inclination, ac∣company me to my couch!—Then shall <HI>I lay me down in peace, and take my rest</HI>; cheerfully referring it to thy allwise determination, whether I shall open my eyes in <HI>this</HI> world, or awake in the unknown regions of <HI>another.</HI></Q></P>

<HEAD>HERVEY's CONTEMPLATIONS ON THE STARRY HEAVENS.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HIS evening, I exchange the nice re∣treats of art for the noble theatre of na∣ture: Instead of measuring my steps under the <HI>covert</HI> of an arbour, let me range along the <HI>summit</HI> of this gently rising hill.—There is no need of the leafy shade, since the sun has quitted the horizon, and withdrawn his scorching beams. But see, how advantages and inconveniences are usually linked, and chequer our affairs below! If the <HI>annoying heat</HI> ceases, the <HI>landscape,</HI> and its pleasing scenes, are also removed.—The majestick castle, and the lowly cottage, are vanished together. I have lost the aspiring moun∣tain, and its russet brow; I look round, but to no pur∣pose, for the humble vale, and its flowery lap. The plains whitened with flocks, and the heath yellow with furze, disappear. The advancing night has wrapt in darkness the long extended forest, and drawn her mantle over the windings of the silver stream. I no longer be∣hold that luxuriant fertility in the fields; that wild mag∣nificence of prospect, and endless variety of images; which have so often touched me with delight, and struck me with awe, from this commanding eminence.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="021885_0262_0FB5F4911321EB30"/>The loss, however, is scarcely to be regretted, since it is amply compensated by the opening beauties of the sky. Here I enjoy a free view of the whole hemisphere; without any obstacle from below, to confine the explor∣ing eye; or any cloud from above, to overcast the spa∣cious concave. 'Tis true, the lively vermilion which so lately streaked the chambers of the west, is all faded. But the <HI>planets,</HI> one after another, light up their lamps; the <HI>stars</HI> advance in their glittering train; a thousand and a thousand luminaries, shine forth in successive splendours; and the wole firmament is kindled into the most beautiful glow. The blueness of the ether, height∣ened by the season of the year, and still more enlivened by the <HI>absence</HI> of the <HI>moon,</HI> gives those gems of heaven the strongest lustre.</P>
<P>One pleasure more, the invading gloom has not been able to snatch from my sense. The night rather im∣proves, than destroys, the fragrance which exhales from the <HI>blooming beans.</HI> With these, the sides of this sloping declivity are lined; and with these, the balmy zephyrs perfume their wings. Does <HI>Arabia,</HI> from all her spicy groves, breathe a more liberal, or a more charming gale of sweets? And, what is a peculiar recommenda∣tion of the rural entertainments, presented in our happy land, they are alloyed by no apprehensions of danger. No poisonous serpent lurks under the blossom; nor any ravenous beast lies ready to start from the thicket.— But, I wander from a far more exalted subject. My thoughts, like my affections, are too easily diverted from the heavens, and detained by inferiour objects. Away, my attention, from these little blandishments of the earth; since all the <HI>glories</HI> of the <HI>sky</HI> invite thy regard.</P>
<P>We have taken a turn among the <HI>tombs,</HI> and viewed the solemn memorials of the dead, in order to learn the vanity of mortal things, and to break their soft en∣chantment.—We have surveyed the <HI>ornaments</HI> of the <HI>gar∣den</HI>; not that the heart might be planted in the parterre, or take root among the flowery race; but that these del∣icacies of a day might teach us to aspire after a better paradise, where beauty never fades, and delight is ever in the bloom.—A third time we lighted the candle of

among the celestial bodies, bring back advices of a most astonishing import. Let me just recollect the most material of those <HI>stupendous discoveries,</HI> in order to furnish out proper subjects for contemplation. And let the un∣learned remember, that the scene I am going to display, is the workmanship of that incomprehensible GOD, who is "perfect in knowledge, and mighty in power:" Whose name, whose nature, and all whose operations, are "great and marvellous:" Who summons into being, with equal ease, a single grain, or ten thousand worlds.—To this if we continually advert, the assertions, though they will certainly excite our <HI>admiration,</HI> need not transcend our belief.</P>
<P>The earth is, in fact, a round body; however it may seem, in some parts, to be sunk into vales, and raised into hills;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A learned writer, I think Dr. <HI>Derbam,</HI> has somewhere an ob∣servation to this purpose▪—That the loftiest <HI>summits</HI> of hills, and the most enormous <HI>ridges</HI> of mountains, are no real objection to the <HI>globular</HI> or round form of the earth.

Without this expedient, one part of its regions would, during half the great revolution, be scorched with ex∣cessive heat, or languish under an unintermitted glare; while the other, exposed to the contrary extremes, would be frozen to ice, and buried under a long oppression of dismal and destructive darkness.</P>
<P>I cannot forbear taking notice, that, in this com∣pound motion of the earth, the one never <HI>interferes</HI> with the other, but both are perfectly <HI>compatible.</HI> Is it not thus with the precepts of religion, and the needful af∣fairs of the present life; not excepting even the innocent gratifications of our appetites?—Some, I believe, are apt to imagine, that they must renounce society, if they devote themselves to CHRIST; and abandon all the satisfactions of <HI>this</HI> world, if they once become zealous candidates for the felicity of <HI>another.</HI>—But this is a very mistaken notion, or else a very injurious representation, of the doctrine which is according to godliness. It was never intended to drive men into deserts; but to lead them, through the peaceful and pleasant paths of wis∣dom, into the blissful regions of life eternal. It was never intended to strike off the wheels of business, or cut in sunder the sinews of industry; but rather, to make men industrious from a principle of <HI>conscience,</HI> not from the instigations of <HI>avarice;</HI> that so they may promote their immortal happiness, even while they provide for their temporal maintenance. It has no design to extirp∣ate our passions, but only to restrain their irregularities; neither would it extinguish the delights of sense, but prevent them from evaporating into vanity, and subsiding into gall.—A person may be cheerful among his friends, and yet joyful in GOD.

The <HI>pa∣rent</HI> may lay up a competent portion for his children, and not forfeit his title to the treasures, either of grace or of glory.—So far is christianity from obstructing any valuable interest, or withholding any real pleasure; that it improves the one, and advances the other. Just as the diurnal and annual motions are so far from <HI>clashing,</HI> that they entirely <HI>accord</HI>; and instead of being destructive of each other, by mutually blending their effects, they give proportion and harmony to time, fertility and in∣numerable benefits to nature.</P>
<P>To us who dwell on its surface, the earth is by far the <HI>most extensive</HI> orb that our eyes can any where be∣hold. It is also clothed with verdure; distinguished by trees; and adorned with a variety of beautiful decora∣tions.

To beings who dwell at still greater distances, it entirely disappears.—That which we call alternately, the morning and the evening star; as in one part of her orbit, she rides foremost in the pro∣cession of night; in the other, ushers in and anticipates the dawn; is a <HI>planetary world</HI>: Which, with the four others, that so wonderfully vary their my stick dance, are in themselves dark bodies, and shine only by reflection; have fields, and seas, and skies of their own: Are fur∣nished with all accommodations for <HI>animal</HI> subsistence, and are supposed to be the abodes of <HI>intellectual</HI> life.

<P>How vast is that debt, which all the wealth of both the <HI>Indies</HI> cannot discharge! How vitiated that habit of body, which all the drugs produced by nature herself, cannot rectify!

Since nothing less than the sufferings and death of Messiah, the Son of GOD, and radiant image of his glory, could effect thy recovery, or cancel thy iniquity. —Though perhaps thou art not sunk so very deep in pollution as some of the most abandoned profligates, yet remember the inestimable ransom paid to redeem thee from everlasting destruction.

If my heart was humbled at the consideration of its excessive guilt; how do all my drooping powers revive at this delightful thought? The poor criminal, that seemed to

be <HI>tottering</HI> on the very brink of the infernal pit, is <HI>rais∣ed,</HI> by such a belief, even to the portals of paradise.

But I hope a more mature consideration will acquit me from <HI>both</HI> these charges.—For what has the author said? Only, that at some <HI>peculiarly happy</HI> moments, when the Holy Ghost bears witness of CHRIST in his heart, and he is favoured with a glimpse of the Redeemer's matchless excellency—that, in these <HI>brighter intervals</HI> of life, his trembling fears, with regard to the de∣cisive sentence of the great tribunal, are turned into pleasing expecta∣tions. And what is there in such a declaration offensive to the <HI>strictest</HI> modesty, or dispiriting to the <HI>weakest</HI> believer? Instead of creating discouragement, it points out the way to obtain a settled tranquillity. Its natural tendency is, to engage the serious mind in a more constant and attentive meditation on the unknown merits of the Divine MEDIATOR. And were we more <HI>thoroughly</HI> acquaint∣ed, more <HI>deeply</HI> affected, with his unutterable dignity, I am persuad∣ed, our uneasy apprehensions would <HI>proportionably</HI> vanish, our faith <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e established, our hopes brightened, and our joys enlarged.</NOTE> I do not, I cannot, doubt the efficacy of this propitiation. <HI>While I see a</HI> glimpse of its matchless ex∣cellency, and <HI>verily believe</HI> myself interested in its mer∣its, I know not what it is to feel any misgiving suspi∣cions; but am stedfast in faith, and joyful through hope.</P>
<P>Be my iniquities like debts of millions of talents, here is more than full payment for all that prodigious sum. Let the enemy of mankind, and accuser of the brethren, load me with invectives; this one plea—<HI>A di∣vine Redeemer died,</HI> most thoroughly quashes every indict∣ment. For, though there be much turpitude, and man∣ifold transgressions,
<Q>there is no condemnation to those that are in CHRIST JESUS.</Q>
—Nay, were I chargeable with all the vilest deeds which have been c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmitted in every age of the world, by every nation of men; even in this most deplorable case, I need not sink into despair.

<P>I have often been struck with wonder at that al∣mighty skill, which <HI>weighed</HI> the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance; which <HI>proportioned</HI> the waters in the hollow of its hand, and <HI>adjusted</HI> the dust of the earth <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Isa.</HI> xl.12.</BIBL> <HI>The dust of the earth,</HI> in this sublime scripture, signifies the dry land, or <HI>solid</HI> part of our globe; which is placed in contradistinction to the whole collection of <HI>fluid</HI> matter, mentioned in the preceding clause.—Perhaps this remarkable expression may be intended to intimate, not only the extreme niceness which stated the dimensions of the world <HI>in general,</HI> or in the gross; but also that <HI>particular exactness,</HI> with which the very smallest materials that con∣stitute its frame, (not excepting each individual atom) were calcu∣lated and disposed.—<HI>q. d.</HI> It is a small thing to say, no such enor∣mous redundancies, as unnecessary ridges of mountains, were suffered to subsist.

is that magnificent economy, which <HI>poised</HI> the stars with inexpressible nicety, and <HI>meted</HI> out the heavens with a span!

<P>Behold yonder countless multitude of globes; con∣sider their amazing magnitude; regard them as the sovereigns of so many systems, each accompanied with his planetary equipage. Upon this supposition, what a multiplicity of mighty spheres must be perpetually run∣ning their rounds, in the upper regions! Yet none mistake their way, or <HI>wander</HI> from the goal, though they pass through trackless and unbounded fields. None <HI>fly off</HI> from their orbits, into extravagant excursions; none <HI>press in</HI> upon their centre with too near an ap∣proach.

<P>On a careless inspection, you perceive no accuracy or uniformity in the position of the heavenly bodies.

What carries a show of negligence, is really the result of the most masterly contrivance.

<P>So, what wears the <HI>appearance</HI> of calamity, in the allotments appointed for the godly, has really the <HI>na∣ture</HI> of a blessing.

He rejoices at his return from extravagance and vice, as he form∣erly rejoiced on the day of his nativity.—When this companion of harlots opens his mouth, <HI>before he speaks, the father hears.</HI> He interrupts him in the midst of his intended speech. The overflowings of his compassion∣ate heart can brook no delay.

While he requests no other indulgence, than only to be treated as the <HI>meanest servant,</HI> he is clothed with the <HI>best robe</HI>; he is feasted with the <HI>fatted calf</HI>; he is caressed as the dearest of children.—Was there ever so bright and win∣ning a picture of the tenderest mercy, most freely vouch∣safed, even to the most unworthy of creatures?

catched a <HI>glimpse</HI> of the Almighty's glory, from the lustre of innumerable stars.

<Q>the soul that sinneth, shall die?</Q>
These awful attributes are set in terrible array, and, like an impenetrable battalion, oppose the salvation of apostate mankind. Who can suggest a method to <HI>absolve</HI> the traiterous race; yet vindicate the honours of almighty sovereignty? This is an intricacy, which the most exalted of finite intelligences are un∣able to clear.—But behold the <HI>unsearchable secret</HI> re∣vealed! revealed in the wonderful redemption, accom∣plished by a dying Saviour!

By this means, the threatened <HI>curse</HI> is executed in all its rigour, and free <HI>grace</HI> is exercised in all its riches. Justice maintains her rights, and, with a steady hand, administers im∣partial vengeance; while mercy dispenses her pardons, and welcomes the repentant criminal into the tenderest embraces.

When his hands were riveted with irons to the bloody tree, he disarmed death of its sting, and plucked the prey from the jaws of Hell.

Even then, he spoiled principalities, tri∣umphed over the powers of darkness, and led captivity captive.—Now he is exalted to his heavenly throne, with what a prevailing efficacy does his grace go forth, "conquering, and to conquer!"—By this, the <HI>slaves</HI> of sin are rescued from their bondage, and restored to the <HI>liberty</HI> of righteousness.

<P>Is not such the <HI>rise,</HI> and such the <HI>progress</HI> of a true <HI>conversion,</HI> in the prejudiced infidel, or inattentive sin∣ner? During the period of his vainer years, a thousand interesting truths lay utterly undiscovered; a thousand momentous concerns were entirely disregarded. But when divine grace dissipates the delusive glitter which dazzled his understanding, and beguiled his affections; then he begins to discern, dimly to discern the things which belong unto his peace. Some admonition of scripture darts conviction into his soul, as the glim∣mering of a star pierces the gloom of night.—Then, perhaps, another awful, or cheering text, impresses ter∣rour, or diffuses comfort. A <HI>threatening</HI> alarms his fears, or a <HI>promise</HI> awakens his hopes. This, possibly, is suc∣ceeded by some <HI>afflictive</HI> dispensation of Providence, and improved by some edifying and <HI>instructive</HI> conversa∣tion: All which is established as to its continuance, and enlarged as to its influence, by a diligent study of the sacred word.—By this means, new truths con∣tinually pour their evidence. Scenes of refined and ex∣alted, but hitherto unknown delight, address him with their attractives: New desires take wing; new pur∣suits are set on foot: A new turn of mind forms his temper; a new habit of conversation regulates his life.

Though every one is incomparably bigger than the globe we inhabit, yet they dwindle, upon our survey, into the most diminutive forms.

But alas! even our most <HI>exalted</HI> ideas are vastly <HI>below</HI> the truth: As much below the truth, as the report which our eyes make of those celestial edifices, is inferiour to their real grandeur.—Should we take in all the <HI>magnify∣ing</HI> assistances which art has contrived, those luminous bodies would elude our skill, and appear as <HI>small</HI> as ever.

<P>If those stars are so many inexhaustible magazines of fire, and immense <HI>reservoirs</HI> of light, there is no reason to doubt, but they have some very <HI>grand uses,</HI> suitable to the magnificence of their nature. To specify, or ex∣plain the particular purposes they answer, is altogether impossible in our present state of distance and igno∣rance. This, however, we may clearly discern; they are disposed in that very manner, which is most <HI>pleasing</HI> and most <HI>serviceable</HI> to mankind.—They are not placed at an <HI>infinite remove,</HI> so as to lie beyond our sight; neither are they brought <HI>so near</HI> our abode, as to annoy us with their beams. We see them shine on every side. The deep azure, which serves them as a ground, height∣ens their splendour. At the same time, their influence is gentle, and their rays are destitute of heat. So that we are surrounded with a multitude of fiery globes, which beautify and illuminate the firmament, without any risque, either to the <HI>coolness</HI> of our night, or the <HI>quiet</HI> of our repose.—Who can sufficiently admire that wonderous benignity, which, on our account, strews the <HI>earth</HI> with blessings of every kind, and vouchsafes to make the <HI>very heavens</HI> subservient to our delight?</P>
<P>It is not solely to adorn the roof of our palace with costly gildings, that GOD commands the celestial lu∣minaries to glitter through the gloom. We also reap considerable benefits from their ministry.—They <HI>divide</HI> our <HI>time,</HI> and fix its solemn periods. They settle the <HI>order</HI> of our <HI>works,</HI> and are, according to the destina∣tion mentioned in sacred writ,

The returns of heat and cold alone, would have been too precarious a rule. But these radiant bodies, by the <HI>variation,</HI> and

<P>Why should not the christian, the probationer for eternity, learn from the same monitors, to <HI>number</HI>—for nobler purposes, to number his <HI>days</HI>; and duly to transact the grand, grand affairs of his everlasting salvation? Since GOD has appointed so many bright measures of our time, to determine its larger periods, and to min∣ute down its ordinary stages, sure, this most strongly inculcates its <HI>value,</HI> and should powerfully prompt us to <HI>improve</HI> it.—Behold! the supreme LORD marks the prog∣ress of our life, in that most conspicuous calendar a∣bove. Does not such an ordination tell us, and in the most emphatical language, that our life is given for <HI>use,</HI> not for <HI>waste?</HI> That no portion of it is delivered, but under a strict account; that all of it is entered as it passes, in the divine register; and, therefore, that the stewards of such a talent, are to expect a future reck∣oning?—Behold! the very heavens are bidden to be the <HI>accomptants</HI> of our years, and months, and days. O! may this induce us to manage them with a vigilant frugality; to part with them as misers with their <HI>hoarded treasure,</HI> warily and circumspectly; and, if possible, as merchants with their <HI>rich commodities,</HI> not without an equivalent, either in personal improvement, or social usefulness!</P>

But, when this auspicious star broke through the gloom, it dissipated the anxiety of his mind, and cleared up his dubious passage.

In all <HI>difficulties,</HI> those sacred pages shed an encouraging ray; in all <HI>uncertainties,</HI> they suggest the right determination, and point out the proper pro∣cedure. What is still a more inestimable advantage, they, like the star which conducted the eastern sages, make plain the way of access to a <HI>Redeemer.</HI> They dis∣play his unspeakable merits; they discover the method of being interested in his great atonement; and lead the weary soul, <HI>tossed</HI> by troubles, and <HI>shattered</HI> by tempt∣ations, to that only harbour of peaceful repose.—Let us, therefore, attend to this <HI>unerring</HI> directory, with the same constancy of regard, as the seafaring man observes his compass.

Yet <HI>all</HI> are beautiful; all have their peculiar lustre, and dis∣tinct use; all tend, in their different degrees, to enamel the cope of heaven, and embroider the robe of night— This circumstance is remarked by an author, whose sentiments are a source of wisdom, and the very stand∣ard of truth.

<P>While I am considering the heavenly bodies, I must not entirely forget those fundamental laws of our mod∣ern astronomy, <HI>projection</HI> and <HI>attraction.</HI> One of which is the all combining cement, the other is the ever ope∣rative spring of the mighty frame.—In the beginning, the allcreating FIAT impressed a proper degree of mo∣tion on each of those whirling orbs; which, if not controlled, would have carried them on, in strait lines, and to endless lengths, till they were even lost in the abyss of space. But, the <HI>gravitating</HI> property, being added to the <HI>projectile</HI> force, determined their courses to a <HI>circular</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I am aware the planetary orbits are not strictly circular, but rather <HI>elliptical.</HI> However, as they are but a small remove from the perfectly round figure, and partake of it incomparably more than the trajectories of the comets, I choose to represent the thing in this view. Especially, because the notion of a circle is so much more intelligible to the generality of readers, than that of an ellipsis; and because I laid it down for a rule, not to admit any such <HI>abstruse</HI> sentiment, or <HI>difficult</HI> expression, as should demand a painful attention, instead of raising an agreeable idea. For which reason, I have avoided <HI>technical</HI> terms; have taken no notice of <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s satellites, or <HI>Saturn</HI>'s ring; have not so much as mentioned the names of the planets, nor attempt∣ed to wade into any depths of the science; lest, to those who have no opportunity of using the telescope, or of acquainting themselves with a system of astronomy, I should propound riddles, rather than display <HI>entertaining</HI> and <HI>edifying</HI> truths.</NOTE> form, and obliged the reluctant rovers to perform their destined rounds.—Were either of those causes to suspend their action, all the harmoniously mov∣ing spheres would be disconcerted—would degenerate into sluggish inactive masses; and, falling into the central

fire, be burnt to ashes: Or else would exorbitate into wild confusion; and each, by the rapidity of its whirl, be <HI>dissipated</HI> into atoms. But, the impulsive and attrac∣tive energy, being most nicely attempered to each other, and, under the immediate operation of the Almighty, exerting themselves in perpetual concert, the various globes run their radiant races, without the least inter∣ruption or the least deviation; so as to create the alter∣nate changes of <HI>day</HI> and <HI>night,</HI> and distribute the use∣ful vicissitudes of <HI>succeeding</HI> seasons; so as to answer all the great ends of a gracious Providence, and procure every comfortable convenience for universal nature.</P>
<P>Does not this constitution of the material, very nat∣urally lead the thoughts to those grand principles of the moral and devotional world, <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>love?</HI>— These are often celebrated by the inspired apostle, as a comprehensive summary of the Gospel.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Col. i.4. Philem. ver. 5.</NOTE> These inspirit the breast, and regulate the progress of each private christian. These unite the whole congregation of the faithful to GOD, and one another. To GOD, the great centre, in the bonds of gratitude and devotion; to one another, by a reciprocal intercourse of brotherly affec∣tions, and friendly offices.—If you ask, Why is it im∣possible for the true believer to live at all adventures? to <HI>stagnate</HI> in sloth, or habitually to <HI>deviate</HI> from duty? —We answer, It is owing to
<Q>his faith, working by love.</Q>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gal. v.6.</NOTE> He assuredly trusts, that CHRIST has sustained the infamy, and endured the torment due to his sins. He firmly relies on that divine propitiation, for the pardon of all his guilt; and humbly expects ever∣lasting salvation, as the purchase of his Saviour's merits. This produces such a spirit of gratitude, as refines his inclinations, and animates his whole behaviour. He cannot, he cannot run to excess of riot; because love to his adorable Redeemer, like a strong, but silken <HI>curb,</HI> sweetly restrains him. He cannot, he cannot lie lulled in a lethargick indolence; because love to the same infi∣nite Benefactor, like a pungent, but endearing <HI>spur,</HI> pleasingly excites him.—In a word, faith supplies the powerful impulse, while love gives the determining bias,
<PB N="151" REF="021885_0331_0FB5E514CE0B2B48"/>
and leads the willing feet through the whole circle of GOD's commandments. By the united efficacy of these <HI>heavenly graces,</HI> the christian conduct is preserved in the uniformity and beauty of holiness; as by the blendid power of those <HI>Newtonian principles,</HI> the solar system re∣volves in a steady and magnificent regularity.</P>
<P>How admirable, how extensive, how diversified is the force of this single principle, <HI>attraction!</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I mean, the attraction both of <HI>gravitation</HI> and <HI>cohesion.</HI></NOTE>—This penetrates the very essence of all bodies, and diffuses it∣self to the remotest limits of the mundane system.—By this, the worlds, impressed with motion, hang <HI>self bal∣anced</HI> on their centres; <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ponderibus librata suis.</NOTE> and, though orbs of immense magnitude, require nothing but this amazing property, for their support.—To this we ascribe a phenomenon, of a very different kind, the <HI>pressure</HI> of the atmos∣phere; which, though a yielding and expansive fluid, yet, constipated by an attractive energy, surrounds the whole globe, and incloses every creature, as it were, with a tight bandage. An expedient this, abso∣lutely necessary to preserve the texture of our bodies; and indeed, to maintain every species of animal exist∣ence.—Attraction! Urged by this wonderful impetus, the <HI>rivers</HI> circulate, copious and unintermitted, among all the nations of the earth: Sweeping with rapidity down the steeps, or softly ebbing through the plains. Impelled by the same mysterious force, the <HI>nutritious juices</HI> are detached from the soil; and, ascending the trees, find their way through millions of the finest meanders, in order to transfuse vegetative life into all the branches. —This confines the <HI>ocean</HI> within proper bounds. Though the waves thereof roar; though they toss themselves with all the madness of indignant rage; yet, checked by this potent, this inevitable curb, they are unable to pass even the slight barrier of sand. To this the <HI>moun∣tains</HI> owe that unshaken firmness, which laughs at the shock of careering winds, and bids the tempest, with all its mingled horrours, impotently rave.—By virtue of this invisible mechanism; without the aid of crane or pulley, or any instrument of human device, many

thousand tons of water are <HI>raised,</HI> every moment, into the regions of the firmament. By this, they continue <HI>suspended</HI> in thin air, without any capacious cistern to contain their substance, or any massy pillars to sustain their weight. By this same variously acting power, they return to the place of their native residence; <HI>distilled</HI> in gentle falls of dew, or <HI>precipitated</HI> in impetuous show∣ers of rain. They <HI>slide</HI> into the fields in fleecy flights of snow, or are <HI>darted</HI> upon the houses in clattering storms of hail.—This occasions the strong <HI>cohesion</HI> of solid bodies. Without which, our large machines could exert themselves with no vigour; and the nicer utensils of life, would elude our expectations of service. This affords a foundation for all those delicate or noble me∣chanick arts, which furnish mankind with numberless conveniences, both of ornament and delight.—In short, this is the prodigious <HI>ballast,</HI> which composes the equilibrium, and constitutes the stability of things: This, the great <HI>chain</HI> which forms the connexions of universal nature; and the mighty <HI>engine</HI> which prompts, facilitates, and, in good measure, accomplishes all her operations.—What <HI>complicated</HI> effects, from a <HI>single</HI> cause! <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See another remarkable instance of this kind, in the <HI>Reflections on a Flower Garden,</HI> vol. I. page 97—together with a fine observation, quoted in the corresponding note.</NOTE> What profusion, amidst frugality! An un∣known profusion of benefits, with the utmost frugality of expense!</P>
<P>And what <HI>is</HI> this attraction? Is it a quality, in its existence, inseparable from matter▪ and, in its acting, independent on the DEITY!—Quite the reverse. It is the very <HI>singer</HI> of GOD: The constant impression of divine power: A principle, neither innate in matter, nor intelligible by mortals.—Does it not, however, bear a considerable analogy to the <HI>agency</HI> of the HOLY GHOST, in the christian economy?

If this be <HI>secured,</HI> thou art greatly rich, and wilt be un∣speakably happy: If this be <HI>lost,</HI> a whole world acquir∣ed, will leave thee in poverty; and all its delights en∣joyed, will abandon thee to misery.</P>
<P>I have often been charmed and awed at the sight of the nocturnal heavens, even before I knew how to con∣sider them in their proper circumstances of majesty and beauty. <HI>Something</HI> like <HI>magick</HI> has struck my mind, on a transient and unthinking survey of the ethereal vault, tinged throughout with the purest azure, and decorated with innumerable starry lamps. I have felt, I know not what, powerful and aggrandizing impulse, which seemed to snatch me from the low entanglements of vanity, and prompted an ardent sigh for <HI>sublimer ob∣jects.</HI> Methought I heard, even from the silent spheres, a commanding call, to spurn the abject earth, and pant after unseen delights.—Henceforward I hope to imbibe

more copiously, this <HI>moral emanation</HI> of the skies; when, in some such manner as the preceding, they are rationally seen, and the sight is duly improved. The stars, I trust, will <HI>teach</HI> as well as <HI>shine</HI>; and help to dispel both na∣ture's gloom, and my intellectual darkness. To some people they discharge no better a service, than that of holding a flambeau to their feet, and softening the hor∣rours of their night. To me and my friends, may they act as ministers of a superiour order; as counsellors of wisdom, and guides to happiness! Nor will they fail to execute this nobler office, if they gently light our way into the knowledge of their adored Maker; if they point out, with their silver rays, our path to his beatifick presence.</P>
<P>I gaze, I ponder; I ponder, I gaze; and think inef∣fable things. I roll an eye of awe and admiration. Again and again I repeat my ravished views, and can never satiate either my curiosity or my inquiry. I spring my thoughts into this immense field, till even fancy tires upon her wing. I find wonders <HI>ever new</HI>; won∣ders more and <HI>more amazing</HI>;—yet, after all my present inquiries, what a mere <HI>nothing</HI> do I know—by all my future searches, how <HI>little</HI> shall I be able to learn—of those vastly distant suns, and their circling retinue of worlds! Could I pry with <HI>Newton</HI>'s piercing sagacity, or launch into his extensive surveys, even then my appre∣hensions would be little better than those dim and scanty images, which the <HI>mole,</HI> just emerged from her cavern, receives on her seeble optick.—This, sure, should repress all impatient or immoderate ardour to pry into the secrets of the starry structures, and make me more particularly careful to cultivate my heart. To fathom the depths of the divine essence, or to scan universal nature with a critical exactness, is an attempt which sets the <HI>acutest philosopher</HI> very nearly on a level with <HI>the idiot</HI>; since it is almost, if not altogether, as impracticable by the former, as by the latter.</P>
<P>Be it then my chief study, not to pursue what is absolutely unattainable, but rather to seek what is ob∣vious to find, easy to be acquired, and of inestimable advantage when possessed. O! let me seek <HI>that charity</HI>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is true, in the delightful seasons, HIS tenderness and HIS love are most eminently displayed.—In the <HI>vernal</HI> months, all is beauty to the eye, and musick to the ear. The clouds drop fatness; the air softens into balm; and flowers, in rich abundance, spring whereever we tread, bloom whereever we look.—Amidst the burning heats of <HI>summer,</HI> He expands the leaves, and thickens the shades. He spreads the cooling arbour to receive us, and awakes the gentle breeze to fan us.

winter then, for a while, our theme.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A sketch of this nature▪ I must acknowledge, is quite different from the subject of the book; and, I cannot but declare, was as far distant from the thoughts of the author. But the desire of <HI>several</HI> acquaintance, together with an intimation of its usefulness, by a very <HI>polite letter</HI> from an <HI>unknown</HI> hand, prevailed with me to add a few descriptive touches, and improving hints, on what is so often ex∣perienced in these northern regions. I hope the attempt I have made to oblige these gentlemen, will obtain the <HI>approbation,</HI> or at least the <HI>excuse,</HI> of my other readers.</NOTE> Perhaps those <HI>barren</HI> scenes may be <HI>fruitful</HI> of intellectual improvement. Perhaps that rigorous cold, which binds the earth in icy chains, may serve to enlarge our hearts, and warm them with holy love.</P>
<P>See! how the day is <HI>shortened!</HI>—The sun, detained in fairer climes, or engaged in more agreeable services, rises, like an unwilling visitant, with tardy and reluctant steps. He walks, with a shy indifference, along the edges of the southern sky; casting an oblique glance, he just looks upon our dejected world, and scarcely scat∣ters light through the thick air. Dim is his appear∣ance, languid are his gleams, while he continues. Or, if he chance to wear a brighter aspect, and a cloudless brow; yet, like the young and gay in the house of mourning, he seems uneasy, till he is gone; is in haste to depart.—And let him depart. Why should we wish for his longer stay, since he can shew us nothing but the creation in distress? The slowery families lie dead, and the tuneful tribes are struck dumb. The trees, stript of their verdure, and lashed by storms, spread their naked arms to the enraged and relentless heavens. Fragrance no longer floats in the air; but chilling damps hover, or cutting gales blow. Nature, divested of all her beautiful robes, sits, like a forlorn disconsolate widow, in her weeds. While winds, in doleful accents howl; and rains, in repeated showers, weep.</P>
<P>We regret not, therefore, the speedy departure of the day. When the room is hung with <HI>funeral black,</HI> and dismal objects are all around, who could desire to have the <HI>glimmering taper</HI> kept alive, which can only
<PB N="167" REF="021885_0346_0FB5E55FD77BB418"/>
discover spectacles of sorrow; can only make the hor∣rour visible?—And, since this mortal life is little better than a continual conflict with sin, or an unremitted struggle with misery, is it not a <HI>gracious</HI> ordination, which has reduced our age to a <HI>span?</HI> Fourscore years of trial, for the virtuous, are sufficiently long; and more than such a term, allowed to the wicked, would render them beyond all measure vile. Our way to the kingdom of Heaven lies through tribulations. Shall we then <HI>accuse,</HI> shall we not rather <HI>bless</HI> the providence which has made the passage short? Soon, soon we cross the vale of tears, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd then arrive on the happy hills, where light forever shines, where joy forever smiles.</P>
<P>Sometimes the day is rendered shorter still; is almost blotted out from the year.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><L>Involvere diem nimbi, et <HI>nox humida</HI> coelum</L>

<BIBL>VIRG.</BIBL></NOTE> The vapours gather; they thicken into an impenetrable gloom, and obscure the face of the sky. At length the <HI>rains</HI> descend: The sluices of the firmament are opened, and the low hung clouds pour their congregated stores: Copious and unintermitted, still they pour, and still are unex∣hausted. The waters drop incessantly from the eaves, and rush in rapid streams from the spouts: They roar along the channelled pavements, and stand in foul shal∣lows amidst the village streets. Now, if the inatten∣tive eye, or negligent hand, has left the roof but scanti∣ly covered, the insinuating element finds its way into every flaw, and oozing through the ceiling, at once upbraids and chastises the careless inhabitant. The ploughman, soaked to the skin, leaves his half tilled acre. The poor poultry, dripping with wet, crowd into shel∣ter. The tenants of the bough fold up their wings, afraid to launch into the streaming air. The beasts, joyless and dispirited, ruminate under their shades. The roads swim, and the brooks swell.—The <HI>river,</HI> amidst all this watery ferment, long contained itself within its appointed bounds: But, swollen by innumerable cur∣rents, and roused at last into uncontrollable rage, bursts over its banks, shoots into the plain, bears down all op∣position,
<PB N="168" REF="021885_0347_0FB5E56154AC28F8"/>
spreads itself far and wide, and buries the meadow under a brown, sluggish, soaking <HI>deluge.</HI></P>
<P>How happy for man, that this inundation comes, when there are no flowery crops in the valley, to be overwhelmed; no fields standing thick with corn, to be laid waste! At <HI>such</HI> a juncture, it would have been <HI>ruin</HI> to the husbandman and his family: But, <HI>thus</HI> timed, it yields <HI>manure</HI> for his ground, and promises him <HI>riches</HI> in reversion.—How often, and how long, has the Di∣vine Majesty bore with the most injurious affronts from sinners! His goodness triumphed over their perverse∣ness, and graciously refused to be exasperated. But, O presumptuous creatures! multiply no longer your provo∣cations: Urge not, by repeated iniquities, the Almighty arm to strike; lest his long suffering cease, and his fierce anger break forth; break forth like a <HI>flood of waters,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hos. v.10.</NOTE> and sweep you away into irrecoverable and everlasting perdition.</P>
<P>How mighty! how majestick! and O how mysteri∣ous are thy works, thou GOD of Heaven, and LORD of Nature! When the air is calm, where sleep the <HI>stormy winds?</HI> In what chambers are they reposed, or in what dungeons confined, till thou art pleased to awak∣en their rage, and throw open their prison doors? Then, with irresistible impetuosity, they fly forth, scattering dread, and menacing destruction.</P>
<P>The atmosphere is hurled into the most tumultuous confusion. The aërial torrent bursts its way over mountains, seas, and continents. All things feel the dreadful shock. All things tremble before the furious blast. The <HI>forest,</HI> vexed and tore, groans under the scourge. Her sturdy sons are strained to the very roof, and almost sweep the soil they were wont to shade. The stubborn oak, that disdains to bend, is dashed headlong to the ground; and, with shattered arms, with prostrate trunk, blocks the road.—While the flexile reed, that springs up in the marsh, yielding to the gust (as the <HI>meek</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pliant temper to injuries, or the <HI>resigned</HI> and patient spirit to misfortunes), eludes the force

of the storm, and survives amidst the wide spread havock.</P>
<P>For a moment, the turbulent and outrageous sky seems to be asswaged; but it intermits its wrath, only to increase its strength. Soon the sounding squadrons of the air return to the attack, and renew their ravages with redoubled fury. The stately dome rocks amidst the wheeling clouds. The impregnable tower totters on its basis, and threatens to overwhelm whom it was in∣tended to protect. The ragged rock is rent in pieces;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Kings, xix.11.</NOTE> and even the hills, the perpetual hills, on their deep foundations, are scarcely secure.—Where now is the place of safety? When the <HI>city</HI> reels, and houses be∣come heaps! Sleep affrighted flies. Diversion is turned into horrour. All is uproar in the elements; all is con∣sternation among mortals; and nothing but one wide scene of rueful devastation through the land.—Yet, this is only an <HI>inferiour</HI> minister of divine displeasure; the executioner of <HI>milder</HI> indignation. How then, O! <HI>how will the lofty looks of man be humbled, and the haughtiness of men be bowed down,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><L>— Mortalia corda</L>
<L>Per gentes humilis stravit pavor.—</L>
<P>One would almost imagine, that <HI>Virgil</HI> had read <HI>Isaiah,</HI> and borrow∣ed his ideas from chap. ii. ver. 11. The <HI>humilis</HI> and <HI>stravit</HI> of the one▪ so exactly correspond with the <HI>humbled—bowed down</HI>—of the other. But, in one circumstance, the prophet is very much supe∣riour to the poet. The prophet, by giving a striking <HI>contrast</HI> to his sentiments, represents them with incomparably greater energy. He says not, <HI>men</HI> in the gross, or the <HI>human heart</HI> in general; but men of the most <HI>elated</HI> looks, hearts big with the most <HI>arrogant</HI> imaginat∣ions. Even <HI>these</HI> shall stoop from their supercilious heights; even <HI>these</HI> shall grovel in the dust of abasement, and shudder with all the extremes of an abject pusillanimity.</P></NOTE> when the LORD GOD Omnipotent shall <HI>meditate</HI> terrour—when he shall set <HI>all</HI> his terrours in array—when he arises to judge the nations, and to <HI>shake terribly</HI> the earth!</P>
<P>The <HI>ocean</HI> swells with tremendous commotions. The ponderous waves are heaved from their capacious bed, and almost lay bare the unfathomable deep. Flung into the most rapid agitation, they sweep over the rocks; they lash the lofty cliffs, and toss themselves into the
<PB N="170" REF="021885_0349_0FB5E564533E21D8"/>
clouds. Navies are rent from their anchors; and, with all their enormous load, are whirled, swift as the arrow, wild as the winds, along the vast abyss.—Now they climb the rolling mountain; they plough the frightful ridge; and seem to skim the skies. Anon they plunge into the opening gulf; they lose the sight of day; and are lost themselves to every eye. How vain is the pilot's art! how impotent the mariner's strength! They reel to and fro, and stagger in the jarring hold; or cling to the cordage, while bursting seas foam over the deck. <HI>Despair</HI> is in every face, and <HI>death</HI> sits threatening on every surge.—But why, O ye astonished mariners, why should you abandon yourselves to despair? Is the LORD's hand <HI>shortened,</HI> because the waves of the sea rage horribly? Is his ear <HI>deafened</HI> by the roaring thun∣ders, and the bellowing tempest? Cry, cry unto HIM, who
<Q>holdeth the winds in his fist, and the waters in the hollow of his hand.</Q>
HE is all gracious to hear, and almighty to save. If HE command, the storm shall be hushed to silence; the billows shall subside into a calm; the lightnings shall lay their fiery bolts aside; and, instead of sinking into a watery grave, you shall find yourselves brought to the desired haven.</P>
<P>Sometimes, after a joyless day, a more dismal night succeeds.—The lazy, louring vapours had wove so thick a veil, as the meridian sun could scarcely penetrate. What gloom then must overwhelm the nocturnal hours! The moon withdraws her shining. Not a single star is able to struggle through the deep arrangement of shades. All is <HI>pitchy darkness,</HI> without one enlivening ray. How solemn! how awful! It is like the shroud of nature, or the return of chaos. I do not wonder, that it is the parent of terrours, and so apt to engender melancholy.—Lately, the tempest marked its rapid way with <HI>mischief</HI>; now the night dresses her silent pa∣vilion with <HI>horrour.</HI></P>
<P>I have <HI>sometimes</HI> left the beaming tapers, withdrawn from the ruddy fire, and plunged into the thickest of those sooty shades, without regretting the change, rather exulting in it as a welcome deliverance. The very gloom was pleasing, was exhilarating, compared
<PB N="171" REF="021885_0350_0FB5E56F6D78CEE0"/>
with the conversation I quitted. The speech of my companions (how does it grieve me, that I should <HI>even</HI> once have occasion to call them by <HI>that</HI> name!) was the language of darkness—was horrour to the soul, and torture to the ear. <HI>Their teeth were spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword,</HI> to stab and assassinate their neighbour's character: <HI>Their throat was an open sepulchre,</HI> gaping to devour the reputation of the inno∣cent, or tainting the air with their virulent and polluted breath. Sometimes their licentious and ungovernable discourse, shot arrows of <HI>profaneness</HI> against Heaven it∣self; and, in proud defiance, challenged the resent∣ment of Omnipotence. Sometimes, as if it was the glory of human nature to cherish the <HI>grossest</HI> appetites of the brute, or the mark of a gentleman to have served an apprenticeship in a brothel, the filthiest jests of the stews (if low <HI>obscenity</HI> can be a jest) were nau∣seously obtruded on the company. All the <HI>modest</HI> part were offended and grieved, while the other besotted creatures laughed aloud, though the leprosy of un∣cleanness appeared on their lips.—Are not these persons <HI>prisoners</HI> of <HI>darkness,</HI> though blazing sconces pour arti∣ficial day through their rooms? Are not their souls im∣mured in the most baleful shades, though the noon tide sun is brightened by flaming on their gilded chariots?— They discern not that great and adorable Being, who fills the universe with his infinite and glorious presence; who is <HI>all eye</HI> to observe their actions▪ <HI>all ear</HI> to exam∣ine their words: They know not the all sufficient Re∣deemer, nor the unspeakable blessedness of his heavenly kingdom: They are groping for the prize of happiness, but will certainly grasp the thorn of anxiety: They are wantonly sporting on the brink of a precipice, and are every moment in danger of falling headlong into <HI>irretrievable</HI> ruin, and <HI>endless</HI> despair.</P>
<P>They have forced me out, and are, perhaps, deriding me in my absence; are charging my reverence for the ever present GOD, and my concern for the dignity of our <HI>rational</HI> nature, to the account of humour and singularity; to narrowness of thought, or sourness

of temper. Be it so. I will indulge no indignation against them: If any thing like it <HI>should</HI> arise, I will convert it into prayer.—<Q>Pity them, O thou Father of mercies! Shew them the madness of their pro∣faneness! Shew them the baseness of their vile rib∣aldry!—Let their dissolute rant be turned into silent sorrow and confusion, till they open their lips to adore thine <HI>insulted</HI> majesty, and to implore thy gracious pardon. Till they devote to thy service, those social hours, and those superiour faculties, which they are now abusing, to the dishonour of thy name—to the contamination of their own souls—and (unless timely repentance intervene) to their everlasting in∣famy and perdition.</Q></P>
<P>I ride home amidst the gloomy void. All darkling and solitary, I can scarce discern my horse's head, and only guess out my blind road. No <HI>companion</HI> but danger; or, perhaps "destruction ready at my side."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job xviii.12.</NOTE> But, why do I fancy myself <HI>solitary?</HI> Is not the Father of lights; the GOD of my life; the great and everlast∣ing friend; always at my right hand? Because the day is excluded, is his omnipresence vacated? Though I have no earthly acquaintance near, to assist in case of a misfortune, or to beguile the time, and divert un∣easy suspicions, by entertaining conferences, may I not lay my help upon the Almighty, and converse with GOD by humble supplication? For this exercise, no place is improper, no hour unseasonable, and no imposture in∣commodious. This is <HI>society,</HI> the best of society, even in solitude;—this is a fund of delights, easily porta∣ble, and quite inexhaustible;—a <HI>treasure</HI> this of un∣known value; liable to no hazard from wrong or rob∣bery; but perfectly secure to the lonely wanderer, in the most darksome paths.</P>
<P>And why should I distress myself with apprehensions at <HI>peril?</HI> This access to GOD, is not only an indefeasi∣ble privilege, but a kind of <HI>ambulatory garrison.</HI> Those who make known their requests unto GOD, and rely upon his protecting care, he gives his angels charge over their welfare.

and <HI>unwholesome</HI> damps:—The raw hazy influence spreads wide, sits deep, hangs heavy and oppressive on the springs of life. A listless languor clogs the ani∣mal functions, and the purple stream glides but faintly through its channels. In vain the ruler of the day exerts his beaming powers: In vain he attempts to dis∣perse this insurrection of vapours: The sullen, malignant cloud refuses to depart: It envelopes the world, and <HI>in∣tercepts</HI> the <HI>prospect.</HI> I look abroad for the neighbouring village; I send my eye in quest of the rising turret, but am scarce able to discern the very next house.—Where are the blue arches of Heaven? Where is the radiant countenance of the sun? Where the boundless scenes of creation?—Lost, lost are their beauties; quenched their glories. The thronged theatre of the universe, seems an empty void, and all its elegant pictures, an undis∣tinguished blank.—Thus would it have been with our intellectual views, if the <HI>Gospel</HI> had not come in to our relief. We should have known neither our true good, nor real evil: We had been a riddle to ourselves; the present state all confusion, and the future impenetrable darkness.—But, the Sun of righteousness, arising with potent and triumphant beams, has dissipated the inter∣posing cloud; has opened a prospect more beautiful than the blossoms of spring; more cheering than the treasures of autumn; and far more enlarged than the extent of the visible system;—which, having led the eye of the mind through fields of grace, over rivers of righteousness, and hills crowned with knowledge, ter∣minates at length in the heavens; sweetly losing itself in regions of infinite bliss, and endless glory.</P>
<P>As I walk along the fog, it seems, at some little dis∣tance, to be almost solid gloom; such as would shut out every glimpse of light, and totally imprison me in ob∣scurity. But, when I approach and enter it, I find myself agreeably mistaken, and the mist much <HI>thinner</HI> than it <HI>appeared.</HI>—Such is the case with regard to the sufferings of the present life; they are not, when ex∣perienced, so dreadful as a timorous imagination sur∣mised. Such also, is the case with reference to the <HI>grat∣ifications</HI> of <HI>sense</HI>; they prove not, when enjoyed, so substantial as a sanguine expectation represented. In
<PB N="175" REF="021885_0354_0FB5E5788E185660"/>
both instances we are graciously disappointed. The keen edge of the calamity is blunted, that it may not wound us with incurable anguish; the exquisite relish of the prosperity is palled, that it may not captivate our affections, and enslave them to inferiour delights.</P>
<P>Sometimes the face of things wears a more pleasing form; the very reverse of the foregoing. The sober evening advances to close the shortlived day: The firmament, clear and unsullied, puts on its brightest blue: The stars, in thronging multitudes, and with a peculiar brilliancy, glitter through the fair expanse; while the <HI>frost</HI> pours its subtle and penetrating influence all around. Sharp and intensely severe, all the long night, the rigid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther continues its operations.—When, late and slow, the morning opens her pale eye, in what a curious and amusing disguise is nature dressed! The icicles, jagged and uneven, are pendent on the houses: A whitish film incrusts the windows, where mimick landscapes rise, and fancied figures swell. The fruitful fields are hardened to iron; the moistened meadows are congealed to marble; and both resound (an effect un∣known before) with the peasant's hasty tread. The stream is arrested in its career, and its ever flowing surface chained to the banks: The fluid paths become a solid road; where the finny shoals were wont to rove, the sportive youth slide, or the rattling chariots roll.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><L>Concrescunt subito currenti in fiumini <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rustae;</L>

<P><PB N="176" REF="021885_0355_0FB5E57DAC55F1F0"/>The air is all serenity;—refined by the nitrous par∣ticles, it affords the most distinct views, and extensive prospects. The seeds of <HI>infection</HI> are killed, and the <HI>pestilence</HI> destroyed, even in embryo: So the cold of <HI>affliction</HI> tends to mortify our corruptions, and subdue our vicious habits. The crowding atmosphere con∣stringes our bodies, and braces our nerves: The spirits are buoyant, and sally briskly on the execution of their office. In the summer months, such an unclouded sky, and so bright a sun, would have melted us with heat, and softened us into supineness: We should have been ready to throw our limbs under the spreading beach, and to lie at ease by the murmuring brook. But now, none loiters in his path; none is seen with folded arms: All is in motion; all is activity: Choice, prompted by the weather, supplies the spur of necessity. Thus the <HI>rug∣ged</HI> school of misfortune, often trains up the mind to a vigorous exertion of its faculties. The <HI>bleak</HI> climate of <HI>adversity,</HI> often inspirits us with a manly resolution; when a soft and downy affluence, perhaps, would have relaxed all the generous spring of the soul, and have left it enervated with pleasure, or dissolved in indolence.</P>
<P>"<HI>Cold</HI> cometh out of the north." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job xxxvii.9</NOTE> The winds, hav∣ing swept those deserts of snow, arm themselves with millions of frozen particles, and make a fierce descent upon our isle. Under black and scouling clouds, they drive, dreadfully whizzing, through the darkened air: They growl around our houses, assault our doors, and, eager for entrance, fasten on our windows. Walls can scarce restrain them; bars are unable to exclude them; through every cranny they force their way. Ice is on their wings; they scatter agues through the land; and winter, all winter, rages as they go.

Let not the corn venture to peep too freely from the en∣trenchment of the furrow; let not the fruit bearing blos∣soms dare to come abroad from their lodgment in the bark, lest these murderous blasts intercept and seize the unwary strangers, and destroy the hopes of the advancing year.</P>
<P>O, 'tis severely cold! Who is so hardy, as not to shrink at this <HI>excessively pinching</HI> weather? See! every face is pale. Even the blooming cheeks contract a gelid hue, and the teeth hardly forbear chattering.—Ye that sit easy and joyous, amidst your commodious apartments, solacing yourselves in the diffusive warmth of your fire, be mindful of your brethren, in the cheerless tenement of poverty. <HI>Their</HI> shattered panes are open to the piercing winds; a tattered garment scarcely covers their shivering flesh; while a few faint and dying em∣bers on the squalid hearth, rather mock their wishes, than warm their limbs.—While the generous juices of <HI>Oporto</HI> sparkle in your glasses; or the streams, beauti∣fully tinged and deliciously flavoured with the <HI>Chinese</HI> leaf, smoke in the elegant porcelain; O remember, that many of your fellow creatures, amidst all the rigour of these inclement skies, are emaciated with sickness, be∣numbed with age, and pining with hunger. Let
<Q>their loins bless you,</Q>
for comfortable clothing. Restore them with medicine; regale them with food; and baffle the raging year. So may you never know any of their distresses, but only by the hearing of the ear, the see∣ing of the eye, or the feeling of a tender commisera∣tion!—Methinks the bitter blustering winds plead for the poor indigents. May they breathe pity into <HI>your</HI> breasts, while they blow hardships into <HI>their</HI> huts!— Observe those blue flames, and ruddy coals, in your chimney: Quickened by the cold, they look more lively, and glow more strongly. Silent, but seasonable admo∣nition to the gay circle, that chat and smile around them! <HI>Thus,</HI> may your hearts, at such a juncture of need, kin∣dle into a peculiar benevolence! Detain not your super∣fluous piles of wood. Let them hasten to the relief of the starving family. Bid them expire in many a willing blaze, to mitigate the severity of the season, and cheer the bleak abodes of want. So shall they ascend, mingled
<PB N="178" REF="021885_0357_0FB5E582822316B0"/>
with thanksgivings to GOD, and ardent prayers for your welfare—ascend, more grateful to Heaven, than columns of the most costly incense.</P>
<P>Now the winds cease. Having brought their load, they are dismissed from service. They have wasted an immense cargo of clouds, which empty themselves in <HI>snow.</HI> At first, a few scattered shreds come wandering down the saddened sky. This slight skirmish is succeed∣ed by a general onset. The flakes, large and numerous, and thick wavering, descend. They dim the air, and hasten the approach of night. Through all the night, in softest silence, and with a continual flow, this fleecy shower falls. In the morning, when we awake, what a surprising change appears!—Is this the same world? Here is no diversity of colour! I can hardly distinguish the trees, from the hills on which they grow. Which are the meadows, and which the plains? Where are the green pastures, and where the fallow lands? All things lie blendid in bright confusion. So bright, that it heightens the splendour of day, and even dazzles the or∣gans of sight.—The lawn is not so fair, as this snowy mantle which invests the fields; and even the lily, was the lily to appear, would look tarnished in its pres∣ence. I can think of but <HI>one</HI> thing, which <HI>excels</HI> or equals the glittering robe of winter. Is any person de∣sirous to know my meaning? He may find it explained in that admirable hymn,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Can any thing be whiter than snow? Yes, saith <HI>David</HI>—If GOD be pleased to wash me from my sins in the blood of CHRIST, <HI>I shall be even whiter than snow.</HI> Psal. li.7. See page 97.</NOTE> composed by the royal peni∣tent. Is any desirous to possess this matchless ornament? He will find it offered to his acceptance in every page of the Gospel.</P>
<P>See! (for the eye cannot satisfy itself, without view∣ing again and again the curious, the delicate scene) see! how the hedges are habited, like spotless vestals! The houses are roofed with uniformity and lustre. The meadows are covered with a carpet of the finest ermine.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This animal is milk white. As for those <HI>black spots</HI> which we generally see in linings of ermine, they are added by the furrier, in order to diversify the appearance, or heighten the beauty of the na∣tive colour.</NOTE> The groves bow beneath the lovely burden, and all,

all below, is one wide, immense shining waste of white· —By deep snows, and heavy rains, GOD <HI>sealeth up the hand of every man.</HI> And for this purpose, adds our sa∣cred philosopher, <HI>that all men may know his work.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job xxxvii.7.</NOTE> He confines them within their doors, and puts a stop to their secular business, that they may consider the things which belong to their spiritual welfare. That, having a vaca∣tion from their ordinary employ, they may observe the works of his power, and become acquainted with the mysteries of his grace.</P>
<P>And worthy, worthy of all observation, are the works of the great Creator. They are prodigiously various, and perfectly amazing. How pliant and ductile is na∣ture under his forming hand! At his command, the self same substance assumes the most different shapes, and is transformed into an endless multiplicity of figures. If HE ordains, the water is <HI>moulded</HI> into hail, and dis∣charged upon the earth like a volley of shot; or it is <HI>consolidated</HI> into ice, and defends the rivers,
<Q>as it were with a breast plate.</Q>
At the bare intimation of his will, the very same element is scattered in hoar frost, like a sprinkling of the most <HI>attenuated</HI> ashes; or is spread over the surface of the ground, in these couches of swelling and <HI>flaky</HI> down.</P>
<P>The snow, however it may carry the appearance of cold, affords a <HI>warm</HI> garment for the corn; screens it from nipping frosts, and cherishes its infant growth. It will abide for a while, to exert a protecting care, and exercise a fostering influence. Then, touched by the sun, or thawed by a softening gale, the furry vesture melts into genial moisture; sinks deep into the soil, and saturates its pores with the dissolving nitre; replenish∣ing the glebe with those principles of vegetative life, which will open into the bloom of spring, and ripen into the fruits of autumn.—Beautiful emblem this, and com∣fortable representation of the divine <HI>word,</HI> both in the successful and advantageous issue of its operation! <HI>As the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and re∣turneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it

bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater: So shall my word be, that goeth forth out of my mouth: It shall not return unto me void, but shall ac∣complish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereunto I sent it.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isa. lv.10.11.</NOTE></P>
<P>Nature, at length, puts off her lucid veil. She drops it in a trickling <HI>thaw.</HI> The loosened snow rolls in sheets from the houses. Various openings spot the hills; which, even while we look, become larger, and more numerous. The trees rid themselves, by degrees, of the hoary incumbrance.—Shook from the springing boughs, part falls heavy to the ground, part flies abroad in shining atoms. Our fields and gardens, lately bur∣ied beneath the drifted heaps, rise plain and distinct to view.—Since we see nature once again, has she no verdant traces, no beautiful features left? They are, like real friends, very rare; and therefore the more par∣ticularly to be regarded, the more highly to be valued. —Here and there, the <HI>holly</HI> hangs out her glowing ber∣ries; the <HI>laurustinus</HI> spreads her graceful tufts; and both under a covert of unfading foliage.—The plain, but hardy <HI>ivy</HI> clothes the decrepid, crazy wall; nor shrinks from the friendly office, though the skies frown, and the storm roars.—The <HI>laurel,</HI> firm, erect, and bold, expands its leaf of vivid green. In spite of the united, the repeated attacks of wind, and rain, and frost, it preserves an undismayed lively look; and maintains its post, while withering millions fall around. Worthy, by vanquishing the rugged force of winter, worthy to adorn the triumphant conqueror's brow.—Nor must I forget the <HI>baytree,</HI> which scorns to be a mean pensioner on a few transient sunny gleams; or, with a servile obsequi∣ousness, to vary its appearance, in conformity to the changing seasons. By such indications of sterling worth, and staunch resolution, reading a lecture to the poet's genius, while it weaves the chaplet for his temples. —These, and a few other plants, clad with native ver∣dure, retain their comely aspect, in the bleakest climes, and in the coldest months.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="021885_0360_0FB5E58FA1EF7830"/>Such, and so durable are the accomplishments of a <HI>refined</HI> understanding, and an <HI>amiable</HI> temper. The tawdry ornaments of dress, which catch the unthinking vulgar, soon become insipid and despicable. The rubied lip and the rosy cheek fade. Even the sparkling wit,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>How little does GOD esteem the things that men count great; the endowments of <HI>wit</HI> and eloquence that men admire in some! Alas! how poor are they to him! He respecteth not any who are wise in heart: They are nothing, and less than nothing in his eyes. Even <HI>wise</HI> men admire how little it is that men know; how small a matter lies under the sound of these popular wonders, a learned man, a great scholar, a great statesman. How much more doth the allwise GOD meanly account of these? He often discovers, even to the world, their meanness. He <HI>befools</HI> them. So valour, or birth, or worldly greatness, these he gives, and gives as things he makes no great reckoning of, to such as shall never see his face; and calls to the inheritance of glory, poor despised creatures, that are looked on as the <HI>offscourings</HI> and <HI>refuse</HI> of the world.</Q></P>
<P>—<HI>Thus</HI> says an excellent author, who writes with the most amiable spirit of benevolence; with the most unaffected air of humility; and, like the sacred originals, from which he copies, with a majestick simplicity of style. Whose <HI>select works</HI> I may venture to recommend, not only as a treasure, but as a <HI>mine</HI> of genuine, sterling, evangelical piety.—See page 520, of Archbishop LEIGHTON's <HI>Select Works,</HI> the <HI>Edinburgh</HI> edition, octavo: Which it is necessary to specify, because the <HI>London</HI> edition does not contain that part of his writings, which has supplied me with the preceding <HI>quotation.</HI></P></NOTE> as well as the sparkling eye, please but for a moment;— but the virtuous mind has charms which survive the decay of every inferiour embellishment—charms which add to the fragrancy of the flower, the <HI>permanency</HI> of the <HI>evergreen.</HI></P>
<P>Such likewise, is the happiness of the sincerely re∣ligious; like a tree, says the inspired moralist,
<Q>whose leaf shall not fall.</Q>
He borrows not his peace from external circumstances; but has a fund within, and is "satisfied from himself."<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Prov. xiv.14.</NOTE> Even though impoverished by calamitous accidents, he is rich in the <HI>possession</HI> of <HI>grace,</HI> and richer in the <HI>hope</HI> of <HI>glory.</HI> His joys are in∣finitely superiour to, as well as nobly independent on, the
<PB N="182" REF="021885_0361_0FB5E59090DA3D50"/>
transitory glow of sensual delight, or the capricious sa∣vours of what the world calls fortune.</P>

How it rebounds from the frozen ground, and rattles on the resounding dome! It attenuates the rivers into smoke, or scourges them into foam. It crushes the infant flowers, cuts in pieces the gardener's early plants, and batters the feeble fortification of his glasses into shivers. It darts into the traveller's face;—he turns with haste from the stroke, or feels on his cheek for the gushing blood. If he would retreat into the house, it follows him even thither; and, like a determined enemy, that pushes the pursuit, dashes through the crackling panes. But the fierce attack is quickly over. The clouds have soon spent their shafts—soon unstrung their bow. Happy for the inhabitants of the earth, that a sally so dreadfully <HI>furious,</HI> should be so remarkably <HI>short!</HI> What, else, could endure the shock, or escape destruction?</P>
<P>But, behold a <HI>bow,</HI> of no hostile intention!

Elegant its form, and rich its tincture; but more delightful its sacred significancy. While the vio∣let and the rose blush in its beautiful aspect, the olive branch smiles in its gracious import. It writes, in radiant dyes, what the angels sung in harmonious strains; "peace on earth, and good will towards men." It is the stamp of <HI>insurance,</HI> for the continuance of
