<P>Two are better than one, because they have a good Reward for their Labour.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THAT <HI>Man is formed for Society,</HI> is evident from the Constitution of his Nature, and the necessary Connections of human Life.—What a surprizing ELO∣QUENCE has the GOD OF NATURE given to the <HI>Eyes,</HI> the <HI>Countenance,</HI> the <HI>Voice,</HI> the <HI>Air,</HI> and <HI>Gesture</HI> of Men! How <HI>expressive</HI> of inward Sentiment and Feeling! And how wisely calculated to raise <HI>corresponding</HI> Senti∣ments and Feelings in the Breasts of <HI>others!</HI> And is it not conspicuous that <HI>all the Passions</HI> have an Aptitude to communicate <HI>strong</HI> Emotions to, and to raise <HI>similar</HI> Passions in one another? How readily (for Instance) do the Passions of <HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>Hope, Love</HI> and <HI>Hatred, Joy</HI> and <HI>Sorrow,</HI> vibrate from one Bosom to another; and awaken the very same Kind of Passions in <HI>many</HI> which were felt at first but in <HI>one!</HI>—Moreover, we ob∣serve amongst Men a <HI>Variety</HI> of GENIUS—Some are framed with peculiar Talents for <HI>forming</HI> Plans, <HI>making</HI> Laws, <HI>inventing</HI> Arts, <HI>taking the Lead</HI> in Science and Government; and consequently to <HI>refine</HI> the Minds, and <HI>polish</HI> the Manners; and <HI>by that Means</HI> to civilize and felicitate human Life. Others, not so ready to contrive and plan Measures, may be more prompt to <HI>execute</HI>—and tho' not so eminent for Wisdom, may be as much distinguished by their Integrity, Love of Freedom, just Regard to Government and the Laws, and Benevolence of Heart.—Now, <HI>all this</HI> was most certainly intended by the gracious AUTHOR of our Being, to promote the <HI>common Safety</HI> and <HI>common Good</HI> of the human Kind. And as Men are <HI>thus formed</HI> for
<PB N="4" REF="011460_0003_0F832EAF1A489B70"/>
<HI>social</HI> Life, a State of Solitude must be a State of In∣security and Misery, while <HI>Society affords the highest Advantages.</HI> Upon <HI>this Principle,</HI> the inspired SOLOMON says in our Text, that <Q>Two are better than One, be∣cause they have a good Reward for their Labour."</Q> —But, as where an End is proposed, there are <HI>certain Means</HI> to be used in Order to obtain that End; and as We can't reasonably expect to <HI>enjoy</HI> the <HI>Advantages</HI> of SOCIETY, unless We <HI>perform</HI> the Duties encumbent upon us as Members of SOCIETY, I shall</P>

</LIST>
<P>First. The DUTIES suited to our Station as Members of SOCIETY <HI>in general.</HI></P>
<P>These Duties are a <HI>religious Regard</HI> to GOD, a <HI>hearty Love</HI> to our COUNTRY, a <HI>just Regard</HI> to the LAWS; and a <HI>Promptitude</HI> to <HI>preserve</HI> and <HI>defend</HI> the CONSTITUTION.</P>
<P>A <HI>religious Regard</HI> to GOD, is the Basis of <HI>all Order</HI> in civil Government, and the only <HI>secure Band</HI> of civil Society. Where the DEITY is not re∣garded, there is <HI>no Conscience,</HI> and consequently <HI>no just Measure</HI> of Good and Evil. All <HI>good</HI> Laws are founded in REASON—GOD is the <HI>supreme</HI> REASON—If then there is no Regard to HIM, the Foundation is de∣molished, and the Superstructure must tumble down; consequently <HI>remorseless</HI> Treason, Rebellion, Injustice, Fraud, and Rapine would disturb the public Tran∣quillity, whenever <HI>private</HI> Passion or <HI>private</HI> Interest might please to throw off Restraint.</P>
<P>In a Country of Atheists, or of Men destitute of <HI>religious</HI> Principles, what Force could there be in OATHS for the <HI>Decision of Controversies?</HI> What Sincerity in an Appeal to GOD? And <HI>without</HI> Sincerity an OATH
<PB N="5" REF="011460_0004_0F832EAFDF2E0A58"/>
becomes, instead of a Means to <HI>promote</HI> Justice, and to <HI>establish</HI> Right, a Cloak for Villainy, an Engine of Mischief! Now it is justly <HI>implied</HI> in the Form of an OATH established by our Laws, that GOD is <HI>not only</HI> to be religiously regarded, but also that that Regard should be <HI>manifested</HI> by a becoming Respect to the GOSPEL of our SAVIOUR. CHRISTIANITY is <HI>thereby</HI> recommended to Us as the <HI>only</HI> System of Re∣ligion that can make Us <HI>good</HI> Men and <HI>good</HI> Members of SOCIETY—And that with the highest Reason—be∣cause it is the GENIUS of the GOSPEL, to <HI>recover</HI> Us from the Dominion of Sin; to <HI>rectify</HI> the Disorders of our Minds; to <HI>correct</HI> and even to <HI>eradicate</HI> our Vices; and to <HI>lead</HI> us on through all the Stages of Virtue, and every Class of Duties, to the highest Perfection. It is therefore <HI>essential</HI> to our being <HI>good</HI> Members of SOCIETY, that We <HI>cultivate</HI> in Ourselves, and <HI>promote</HI> in Others, <HI>such</HI> a religious Regard to the DEITY.</P>
<P>A <HI>hearty</HI> LOVE OF OUR COUNTRY is another Duty incumbent upon Us as Members of SOCIETY. This is a Duty of a very <HI>extensive</HI> Nature; and includes in it all those Duties which We <HI>owe</HI> to our Parents, our Children, Brothers, Friends, Neighbours, and Coun∣trymen in general—Without an <HI>undissembled</HI> and <HI>active</HI> Benevolence to whom, the human Breast must be as a dark hideous Dungeon—a Habitation of the vilest Vermin!</P>
<P>This LOVE OF OUR COUNTRY, is not therefore a mere partial Regard to <HI>any particular Soil or Province,</HI> where We first drew our Breath (tho' that <HI>natural</HI> Tie, in Conjunction with <HI>moral</HI> Ones may, in certain Situa∣tions, strengthen our Attachment) —but it implies a <HI>strong</HI> Affection to the COMMUNITY in which Wedwell, as governed by <HI>just</HI> and <HI>equitable</HI> Laws, flowing from a wise and happy CONSTITUTION; and <HI>cemented</HI> in all it's Parts by the great Principle of a COMMON INTEREST.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="011460_0005_0F832EB2A2B66210"/><HI>Such</HI> a CONSTITUTION of GOVERNMENT We partake of, who are Members of the ROYAL-COMMONWEALTH of BRITAIN—A CONSTITUTION which (when well pre∣served) gives Security against the <HI>Tyranny</HI> of Princes, and against the <HI>Licentiousness</HI> of the People—A Con∣stitution which admits not of Injustice to <HI>any,</HI> and gives Freedom and Safety to <HI>all</HI>—A CONSTITUTION under which our Lives, our Liberty, our Property, can never be touch'd, but by the JUDGMENT OF OUR PEERS, and by the LAWS of <HI>our own enacting.</HI> What <HI>honest</HI> Bosom then does not glow with Love to the COMMUNITY, being founded in Principles so just and equitable? And what worthy Heart does not burn with Indignation against it's Enemies?—In this Case, <HI>In∣difference must be highly criminal.</HI></P>
<P>It is our Duty <HI>also</HI> to pay a <HI>due</HI> REGARD TO THE LAWS. By the Laws We are not to understand <HI>every</HI> Law that <HI>may possibly</HI> be enacted, (for it is <HI>possible</HI> that under <HI>Colour of Law,</HI> We <HI>may</HI> one Day be called upon to swear Allegiance to <HI>some</HI> PRETENDER) but by the Laws, We mean every Law that is <HI>regularly</HI> passed in <HI>Consistence</HI> with the <HI>fundamental</HI> Laws of the Realm— especially the GRAND CHARTER, the BILL OF RIGHTS, the ACT OF SETTLEMENT, and the <HI>ancient</HI> CUSTOMS —To <HI>such</HI> Laws, and their <HI>due</HI> Execution, We are in∣debted for our <HI>common</HI> Safety and <HI>common</HI> Happiness. It is <HI>therefore</HI> the Duty of each Individual to obey the Laws, and to submit to the <HI>civil</HI> MAGISTRATES, as the Guardians and Executors of them. It is from THEM that We expect Protection, as the Conservators of the public Peace, and as the Guardians of our Freedom; and therefore We <HI>owe</HI> THEM the highest Defference in their several Departments, and the best Support in the Execution of their respective Offices. <HI>Without this</HI> Regard to the <HI>constitutional</HI> Laws, the Community can∣not long exist; but must quickly sink into a lawless Rabble; Anarchy and Confusion would over-run our
<PB N="7" REF="011460_0006_0F832EB2EF5D1770"/>
Country, while Justice, Mercy, Honour, Truth and Bliss, would forsake our Dwellings!</P>
<P><HI>Another Duty,</HI> incumbent on Us all, as Members of Society in general, is a PROMPTITUDE to <HI>preserve</HI> and <HI>defend</HI> the <HI>happy</HI> CONSTITUTION of our Country—A Constitution perhaps the best, because the most equi∣table, and the least liable to abuse, of any under the Sun—<HI>wisely</HI> balanced, and <HI>exactly</HI> calculated to answer all the desirable Ends of Government—SUCH A SYSTEM ought to be watched with the greatest Circumspection —for tho' it is an Object of Veneration amongst the wise and good; yet it is an Object of Dislike amongst the Sons of Avarice and Debauchery, who can never thrive but amidst their Country's Distresses. And if at any Time Corruption or Violence should attempt an Encroachment upon it, We ought to resist the Attack, so as to defeat, if possible, the <HI>traiterous</HI> In∣tention—and <HI>this</HI> at the Risque of all that is dear to Us under the Heavens.—The <HI>unmanly,</HI> the <HI>iniquitous,</HI> Doctrine of <HI>passive Obedience</HI> and <HI>Non-Resistance,</HI> is I hope for ever exploded, and banished these Realms— so that, however it <HI>may</HI> lurk in the dark Bosoms of Malevolence, Selfishness, and Disloyalty, it will ever be ashamed to appear again in any Part of the British Dominion—For it is very certain that the PEOPLE are the <HI>natural,</HI> the <HI>original,</HI> FOUNTAIN of HONOUR, AU∣THORITY, and LAWS. When therefore their <HI>funda∣mental</HI> LAWS are <HI>corrupted</HI>; when their <HI>delegated</HI> AU∣THORITY is <HI>prostituted</HI> to pernicious Purposes; when THEY see the CONSTITUTION of their Country <HI>over-turning</HI>;—are THEY to stand as <HI>passive</HI> Spectators of the Ruin?—Rather it is their Duty to stand forth as the AVENGERS of Injustice, the RESTORERS of public Virtue; and to bring Tyranny <HI>or</HI> Treason to <HI>condign</HI> Punishment.—This is a Doctrine (not of Licentious∣ness, but) of the <HI>highest</HI> Loyalty, and the <HI>purest</HI> Regard to the public Good. For this <HI>Doctrine</HI> not admitted,
<PB N="8" REF="011460_0007_0F832EB392D36D70"/>
this <HI>Duty</HI> not practised upon an Emergency, what Safety has our SOVEREIGN in his Throne? What Secu∣rity the PEOPLE in their Rights?—An ignorant, or a debauched Mind, can't perhaps consider this Doctrine, without the Idea of a <HI>lawless</HI> Rabble in Arms against <HI>lawful</HI> Government—but I am persuaded that <HI>such</HI> an Idea is more abhorrent to the <HI>sober</HI> Advocates for this Principle, than to <HI>those</HI> who generally debase it by so <HI>gross</HI> a Conception.—It is a Principle on which was founded the GLORIOUS REVOLUTION; and to which the ILLUS∣TRIOUS HOUSE OF HANOVER is indebted for its Right to the British Crown—<HI>which may GOD preserve to the latest Ages.</HI></P>
<P>Having pointed out the Duties incumbent upon Us all, as Members of Society in general; I am now to <HI>recommend</HI> some Measures to THIS SOCIETY in parti∣cular.</P>
<P>I am sensible that the PLANTER's SOCIETY was <HI>origi∣nally</HI> formed, tho' on Principles of Public Virtue, yet, on a <HI>limited</HI> Plan—But on particular Occasions these Prin∣ciples will certainly excite You to pursue Measures of more <HI>extensive</HI> Utility; and where your Country calls, for <HI>either</HI> Counsel or Action, You are ever prompt to <HI>obey</HI> the Call with Alacrity and Cheerfulness, to the ut∣most of your Ability.—I need not inform You, GEN∣TLEMEN, that at <HI>this very Time,</HI> Your Country calls for the Exertion of <HI>all</HI> your Talents—Not only is your OWN PROVINCE, but all NORTH-AMERICA, and even∣tually the WHOLE BRITISH EMPIRE, in Hazard of being plunged into Disgrace and Ruin, by Measures <HI>subver∣sive</HI> of Freedom—You know there have been two Questions <HI>lately</HI> agitated in the British Parliament, and resolved against the very <HI>first</HI> Principles of the Con∣stitution! The first is, <Q><HI>Whether</HI> You are Freeholders and Men of Property, <HI>or only</HI> Tenants at Will, and the Money in your Purse at <HI>your Own,</HI> or at the Command of <HI>Others?</HI></Q> Secondly—<Q>Whether you
<PB N="9" REF="011460_0008_0F832EB62112C048"/>
shall be subject to the Laws of the Land, and the Judgment of your Peers, in Matters of Debate, <HI>or</HI> to a Court of Admiralty, and absolute Dependants on the Crown?</Q>—It has been alledged, that these Points are settled by the Parliament of Great-Britain, and that their Determinations <HI>should</HI> and <HI>must</HI> be decisive. The BRITISH PARLIAMENT is an <HI>august</HI> Body, and We should ever speak of it's Wisdom and Authority with the Reverence it <HI>deserves.</HI> But is the British Parlia∣ment infallible? Should it, or <HI>can it legally,</HI> contradict itself? If LORD CHIEF-JUSTICE COKE was alive, HE would declare that such Determinations, as above hinted at, are <HI>void in themselves:</HI> And that for this plain Reason, because they are repugnant to the GREAT CHARTER of ENGLAND, to the BILL OF RIGHTS, and to <HI>many other</HI> ACTS OF PARLIAMENT, which stand <HI>unrepealed</HI>—To these <HI>capital</HI> Laws, British Subjects may safely appeal: These Laws are our Judges; by their express Determination We abide. If <HI>they</HI> should declare that the Law of the Land is as a <HI>Nose of Wax,</HI> and Trials by our Peers a <HI>dubious</HI> or <HI>precarious Right,</HI> then the Point would be settled, till We could make our <HI>imaginary</HI> Freedom <HI>real.</HI> But here, my COUNTRYMEN! We stand upon a stable Bottom—here's a Basis that can never be <HI>re∣moved,</HI> but by the total Ruin of the whole Empire— <HI>Which may Heaven mercifully preserve.</HI> But after all— <Q>Is it not Rebellion to oppose an Act of Parliament? Is it not Treason to fly in the Face of Government?</Q> To these Questions it may be safest to let the <HI>learned</HI> reply—Lord CAMBDEN declared <HI>such</HI> Acts of Parlia∣ment to be contrary to the RIGHTS of AMERICANS — And <HI>such</HI> Opposition, MR. PITT told the House of Commons HE rejoiced in. <HI>However,</HI> the Opposition, <HI>at present,</HI> is rather IN, than AGAINST, Acts of Parlia∣ment—One Act being <HI>contradictory</HI> to another. <HI>If any</HI> Opposition is <HI>now</HI> made by AMERICANS—it is <HI>argumen∣tative</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="011460_0009_0F832EB6AA6272D8"/>
only—not an Opposition by a Breach of the Peace; but by sober Remonstrance, and humble Pe∣tition, <HI>founded</HI> upon the Laws, and our unalienable, and accustomed Rights.—But these Remonstrances are not heard—these Petitions are not answered: We are still <HI>plundered</HI> of our Property, and <HI>deprived</HI> of our Birth-rights. Then I earnestly recommend it to You, Gentlemen, as a Society of Freemen, a Band of Brothers, to give Us the Example in Signing the AGREEMENT. In that there is no Treason; no Dis∣loyalty; nor any Thing that savours of Rebellion, <HI>even by the severest Implication of Law</HI>—Nothing in short, but Resolutions to <HI>avoid</HI> Extravagance, to <HI>pro∣mote</HI> Oeconomy, and to <HI>encourage</HI> Industry. This is a Measure, that will answer both <HI>private</HI> and <HI>public</HI> good Purposes. <HI>First,</HI> it will enable you to pay your Debts. <HI>Secondly,</HI> it will operate so as to bring our MOTHER-COUNTRY to Right-Reason, and teach Her the Necessity of a maternal Regard to her virtuous Sons—which will be no Injury to HER, but of last∣ing Benefit to BOTH.—By this sober, quiet, short, and easy Measure, We shall <HI>convince</HI> the World, that We are <HI>honest</HI> Men, and <HI>good</HI> Subjects, paying an <HI>equal</HI> Regard to the Peace, and to the Welfare of our Country—And, We may be confident, that our SO∣VEREIGN (if rightly informed) will <HI>applaud</HI> our Virtue, while HE <HI>admires</HI> the Dignity of our Behaviour; and will not in future listen to the Calumnies of those Men who <HI>attempt to sacrifice</HI> the Royal Repose, the Constitution of their Country, and the Freedom of Millions, to their unbounded Avarice and Ambition. —I hope <HI>therefore,</HI> that no HONEST MAN in this Assem∣bly, and I am persuaded, that no Member of the PLANTER's SOCIETY, will refuse to sign his Name to the AGREEMENT.</P>
<P>GENTLEMEN! You will permit me farther to ob∣serve, that as your Society was at first formed upon a
<PB N="11" REF="011460_0010_0F832EB7724DE630"/>
Design of Usefulness to this <HI>particular</HI> Part of your Country, there are two Objects highly worthy of your Attention. <HI>One</HI> is the ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE▪ the <HI>Other,</HI> a REFORMATION OF MANNERS.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>first,</HI> viz. The ADMINISTRATION OF JUS∣TICE, the Law provides indeed for the <HI>easy Recovery of small</HI> Debts and Damages. But the Executors of this Law are not, <HI>all</HI> of them, (as it is said) Men of Ho∣nour and Honesty, but the Promoters of Quarrels, and <HI>little litigious</HI> Suits, amongst their Neighbours: Plunderers of the Poor, instead of Guardians of Right. Whether so <HI>heavy</HI> a Charge is <HI>just</HI> or <HI>unjust,</HI> GENTLE∣MEN, You know.—I am sure, that no <HI>worthy</HI> Ma∣gistrate, can suppose it aimed at Him; and as to <HI>Others,</HI> I leave them to feel that Remorse which sooner or later <HI>will fasten</HI> as a Vulture on their Bosoms. —But if the Charge is <HI>just,</HI> should not Something be done to <HI>remedy</HI> this Evil? I would submit it to the Consideration of THIS SOCIETY, if it would not be proper to <HI>search out</HI> Men of this Character—to <HI>lodge Complaints</HI> against them, and to <HI>use Endeavours to pro∣cure</HI> their being struck out of the Commission. I re∣commend this Measure, because it is thought in itself a <HI>necessary Measure</HI>—And you will the more readily come into it, as by this Means you will <HI>crush</HI> Injustice, and <HI>save</HI> the honest Poor out of rapacious Hands.</P>
<P>You well know, GENTLEMEN! that it is <HI>essential</HI> to the <HI>due Admin<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ration of Justice,</HI> that <HI>proper Courts</HI> be legally established for that Purpose. The Legislature now waits to <HI>hear</HI> and to <HI>redress</HI> your Grievances. Now is your Time, firmly to unite with your Fellow-Parishoners and Countrymen, in soliciting Relief. You know that You have a Friend in his HONOUR THE LIEUTENANT-GOVERNOR, You have Friends in his MAJESTY's COUNCIL, and in the GENERAL AS∣SEMBLY—but <HI>You have Enemies</HI> too, that will, if possible, (in Order to promote their own private
<PB N="12" REF="011460_0011_0F832EB83913F810"/>
Emolument) elude the just Designs of all the Friends of their Country.—But do You be <HI>steady</HI> in the Pro∣secution of every necessary Means to obtain the de∣sired End—be <HI>patient</HI>—be <HI>spirited</HI>—be <HI>united</HI>—and as your Cause is good, I doubt not but GOD will <HI>befriend,</HI> and the LEGISLATURE <HI>relieve</HI> You.</P>
<P>I mentioned REFORMATION OF MANNERS—This at <HI>the first View</HI> may seem, tho' necessary in itself, yet an Object that does not come within the Plan of your Institution—But as you extend your Views in <HI>some</HI> Cases, where You think it expedient, so with equal Propriety, You may in <HI>others,</HI> under the same Appre∣hension. Now, You very well know, that the Pro∣tection and Blessing of ALMIGHTY GOD is the <HI>best,</HI> yea the <HI>only,</HI> certain Security to our Rights and Privileges—If GOD should forsake Us, and resolve to punish Us for our Crimes, We fall a Prey to the Ambition and Avarice, the Pride and Luxury of Masters, who will set no Bounds to their Lust; and in Order to keep Us in abject Slavery, will <HI>rule Us with a Rod of Iron</HI>—And what can so directly tend to bring upon Us those Evils, as our Vices? It was Vice that <HI>pulled</HI> down the Vengeance of Heaven upon the Cities of SODOM and GOMORRAH—upon BABYLON and NINEVAH—upon the States of GREECE—the Em∣pire of ROME—and every other People, who have lost their Liberty, their Glory, and Felicity. And as the <HI>same Causes</HI> produce the <HI>same Effects</HI> in the <HI>moral</HI> as well as the <HI>material</HI> World, our Vices will (unless repented of) bring upon us the like Ruin. Gentle∣men! I address You upon this Subject, because, in this Part of our Province, most of You are elevated in your Circumstances—above the generality of your Neighbours—This, added to your being Members of the PLANTER's SOCIETY, sets You in a Point of Light, which attracts peculiar Notice——<HI>Your Example then, has considerable Influence,</HI> and which I hope will always
<PB N="13" REF="011460_0012_0F832EB8E24E8820"/>
be so expressive of a pious Regard to the GOSPEL of CHRIST, and to the LAWS of GOD, as that <HI>We may safely tread in your Steps.</HI> And if you will use your Endeavours to procure an <HI>effectual Law</HI> for the Suppression of Vagrants <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Legislature</HI> wisely confiders that those Persons who have <HI>no visible Way</HI> of acquiring an <HI>honest</HI> Livelihood, are ready to use <HI>dishonest</HI> Means for that Purpose—from which springs up a School of Idleness and Vice, in the very Heart of the Common-Wealth—but by some Defect or other, Persons of this Character swarm over the remote Parts of this Country, to the great Injury of the <HI>honest</HI> and <HI>industrious.</HI></NOTE>; and to promote the Exe∣cution of the Laws for the Regulation of public Houses, the <HI>due</HI> Observation of the Sabbath, the Pre∣vention of prophane Swearing, and of other Vices, which are the Reproach and Ruin of our Country, You will deserve the Applause of every good Man, enjoy the sweet Sensations of a benevolent Heart, and in all probability see the KINGDOM of Our SAVIOUR <HI>flourish,</HI> and the Kingdom of Darkness and Sin gra∣dually <HI>sink</HI> into Ruins—<HI>Which may</HI> GOD <HI>in Mercy grant for</HI> CHRIST's <HI>Sake.</HI> Amen.</P>
