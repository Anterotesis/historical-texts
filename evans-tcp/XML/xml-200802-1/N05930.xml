<HEAD>COPY of a LETTER from <HI>a Gentlewoman</HI> in NEW-ENGLAND to <HI>another Gentlewoman</HI> her Friend, great Concern of Soul.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>July 2, 1753</DATE>.</DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My very dear, dear, Friend!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have thought much on those few Lines you began to write to me; and do not at all wonder that you expect I should improve <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Opportunity to relieve you,—For surely the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rong Bonds of <HI>Friendship,</HI> with which we hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for some Years been bound to each other (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> there no Bonds of <HI>Grace</HI> at all) demand this, and how much more when these are add∣ed? And truly, <HI>my dear Friend,</HI> it has not been owing to want of Tenderness, and Compassion towards you, under your Distresses, that my <HI>Tongue</HI> as well as <HI>Pen</HI> have oft been silent. No! my Bowels earn'd. and I long'd to speak many Times; but your Difficultys were such, that I dare not open my Lips, least at subtil Adversary should turn that against you, which I intended for your Comfort, and sink your Spirits the low∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> has sometimes you know been the Case.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="007523_0003_102BA02111D88AE0"/>And Oh that GOD will now bless the poor wea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Endeavours of a worthless Worm to refresh you! If so, it will rejoyce me much: But whether it please Him to use a poor nothing Creature as an Instrument or no; I am perswaded he will in his own Time revive you, and I rejoyce and praise him on your Behalf, by Grace: that he will turn your Captivity; and that He will bruise <HI>Satan</HI> under your'Feet shortly, and make him gladly quit the Field, and leave you to enjoy your God. For blessed be God, <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> is stronger than <HI>He</HI> and all his combin'd Legions; and he can't resist his Power, tho' he has audaciously struck at his Honour, and endeavour'd to impede his blessed Work in your Soul. Do's or has the bold-daring Spirit presumed to insinuate that all <HI>Religion,</HI> is <HI>vain, imaginary,</HI> and <HI>delusive</HI>? Do's he pretend that none can know they are right?—ell him from me, <HI>He is a Liar,</HI> and I am bold to say, I have prov'd him so. He has told me the same Tale: But blessed be God, I do know that <HI>Religion</HI> is no imaginary Thing, but a <HI>substanital Reality.</HI> I do know that there is GOD of boundless Perfections, Truth any Faith∣fulness; that will not deceive, no nor forsake the Soul that puts its Trust in him.</P>
<P>But now perhaps you'll say, Aye, <HI>but bow do I know this God is mine; and that I myself and not deceived?</HI> I <HI>answer,</HI> by the <HI>Evidences</HI> of a <HI>Work of Grace</HI> wrought in my Soul. And now as God shall enable me, <HI>my dear Friend.</HI> I'll tell you truly what GOD has done for my Soul, and
<PB N="4" REF="007523_0004_102BA022FA304D20"/>
what I call <HI>Evidences</HI> of a <HI>Work of Grace.</HI> This <HI>Question</HI> I could never fully verbally answer, when with you, which makes me now attempt to explain myself.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> then, I do know that God has by his <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Spirit,</HI> convinced me of <HI>Sin, Original</HI> and <HI>Actual</HI>; that I was by Nature a Child of Wrath, an Heir of Hell, an Enemy to Him, and his Ways, yea, Enmity itself; <HI>Dead in Trespasses and Sins</HI>; and that I was both utterly, <HI>unable,</HI> and <HI>unwilling</HI> too, to help myself out of this miserable State, being averse to the Gospel-Way of Salva∣tion, wrought out by <HI>Christ.</HI> I plainly see the Cause of that Complaint, <HI>Ye will not come to me, that ye might have Life.</HI> God convinced me also that <HI>by the Deeds of the Law, no Flesh living should be justified,</HI> and that He and his Throne would be spotless forever tho' He should cast me off, and condemn me to the hottest Hell: Since He ow'd me nothing nor was any Way bound to bestow his Grace upon me; and if he did, it would be absolutely free and sovereign.—GOD shew'd me I was, utterly unworthy that he should help me.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, tho' I had thus destroyed myself, yet in <HI>Him</HI> was my Help. Yea He <HI>discover'd to me,</HI> that <HI>he had laid Help</HI> upon <HI>ONE</HI> who is <HI>mighty to save to the uttermost all that come to God by Him</HI>; even a glorious CHRIST the Great EMANUEL God-Man, even one Co-equal with Himself, <HI>the express Image of his Person▪ in whom dwells, all the Fulness of the Godhead bodily</HI>;
<PB N="5" REF="007523_0005_102BA0250619D808"/>
One every Way compleat and suited to all my wants; and that He was not only thus qualify'd and sealed and sent by the FATHER, but that he was absolutely <HI>willing</HI> as well as <HI>able</HI> to accom∣plish the great Work; and would by no means cast out any that come to him.</P>
<P>Well upon <HI>this Discovery</HI> of the amiable and lovely JESUS, if I know that I have a Being, I do know that God compell'd or <HI>sweetly constrain∣ed me</HI> to <HI>throw down</HI> the Weapons of my Rebellion and to <HI>submit</HI> to HIM as <HI>Prince</HI> and <HI>Saviour,</HI> and <HI>consent</HI> to be saved by him in his own way, and upon his own Terms; that he should be the <HI>Al∣pha</HI> and the <HI>Omega,</HI> the Foundation and the Topstone in my Salvation. Yea, God <HI>caus'd my Heart to go out after Him</HI> in strong and <HI>vehement Desires,</HI> and to <HI>choose Him</HI> in <HI>all his Offices,</HI> with <HI>all his Benefits,</HI> to be <HI>my Portion</HI> forever. Yea <HI>He appear'd to me</HI> to be <HI>in Himself the most love∣ly and desirable Object,</HI> the fairest of ten thousand Fairs: and God enabled me to <HI>give myself,</HI> my <HI>whole Soul and Body</HI> with <HI>all my Concerns</HI> for Time and Eternity into his merciful and faithful Hands: and had I a thousand precious Souls, I would gladly venture them all with him; for <HI>I am per∣swaded</HI> he will keep by his mighty Power what I have committed to his Charge; nor shall all the Hosts of Hell, ever be able to pluck me out of his Hands.</P>
<P>But to proceed; upon <HI>this choice,</HI> and <HI>surren∣der</HI> to CHRIST as <HI>Mediator,</HI> GOD the FATHER <HI>manifested</HI> himself to me, as my reconciled GOD
<PB N="6" REF="007523_0006_102BA026F107C5E8"/>
and <HI>Father</HI>; the <HI>blessed</HI> SPIRIT took up his a∣bode with me, afforded me his Influences and As∣sistance daily; and God made with me an <HI>ever∣lasting Covenant,</HI> never to be forgotten, <HI>Even the sure Mercies of David</HI>: and <HI>I solemnly gave myself up,</HI> all I have, am, or can do, both in Life and Death, in Time, and for Eternity, to GOD the FATHER, SON and HOLY GHOST, to be his own, in a Covenant Way, to be disposed of as shall most consist with his Glory; and chose the glorious TRINITY for my <HI>Portion</HI> forever, in opposition to all Others, even a GOD of infinite Perfections. Oh happy Choice! oh happy I, that I liv'd to see that Day wherein GOD betroth'd me to him∣self in loving Kindness and tender Mercy!</P>
<P>Thus I was <HI>effectually called</HI> and <HI>made willing</HI> in the Day of GOD'S Power to <HI>receive</HI> Him: and <HI>to as many as receiv'd Him to them gave He Pow∣er to become the Sons of God, even to those that believe on his Name.</HI></P>
<P>And now the <HI>Foundation</HI> of my <HI>Hopes</HI> are laid upon the <HI>Rock of Ages.</HI> And agreeable to those covenant Engagements, a faithfull GOD, has ever since dealt with me. And surely I can say; where∣as as I was born blind, now I can see; <HI>old Things are done away, all Things become new.</HI> Now thro' Grace I dare appeal to a Heart-searching GOD and say; that none of his Commands are griev∣ous; I esteem them all <HI>holy, right, just,</HI> and <HI>good</HI>; and long to yield a <HI>universal Obedience</HI> to them all: yea GOD does excite in me strong and <HI>vehe∣ment Desires</HI> after an <HI>entire Conformity</HI> to his <HI>Law,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="007523_0007_102BA02913E1B8C0"/>
as tho' my whole Salvation depended thereon while at the same Time, he will not suffer me to depend on any thing but CHRIST alone; not∣withstanding a strong <HI>Propersity</HI> to cleave to the <HI>Covenant of Works</HI>; but enables me to <HI>account all Things as Loss and Dung and filtby Rags, in point of Justification</HI>; nor would I for a Million Worlds appear before GOD, in the best Perfor∣mance I ever did: No 'tis in <HI>that spotless Righ∣teousness,</HI> which CHRIST has wrought out, im∣puted to me, and in that only I dare appear be∣fore GOD. But he gives me to see a <HI>Beauty</HI> in <HI>Holiness,</HI> which far exceeds the Lustre of all created Things. Nor do I know what Desire means, after any, or all the <HI>Enjoyments</HI> of <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Sense, compar'd</HI> with those ardent <HI>Longings,</HI> and <HI>Pantings,</HI> which He at sometimes excites in my Soul, after the <HI>Enjoyment</HI> of <HI>Himself</HI>; and for <HI>sanctifying Grace.</HI></P>
<P>And tho' Grace is not always alike in Exercise; (no I am sometimes dull and lifeless as to Exercise) yet blessed be GOD its has been the habitual, and settled Bent of my Soul for many Years; to choose GOD, his CHRIST, and <HI>Grace</HI> for my Por∣tion in all Conditions, both adverse and prosper∣ous. Blessed be GOD, my Faith has not been stagger'd. Sometimes He has bereav'd, cut off the Streams of earthly Comforts, one after ano∣ther; and then caused me to justify him, and fly to <HI>Him</HI> as my all. Sometimes He has hid his Face, and caused me to mourn after <HI>Him,</HI> and, refuse all Comfort till <HI>He,</HI> return'd. Sometimes
<PB N="8" REF="007523_0008_102BA02ADF376CB0"/>
He has permitted <HI>Satan</HI> to tempt and tyranize over me for a Season; and many a precious <HI>Jewel</HI> has he stolen from me by clouding my Evi∣dences and infinuating that all was Delusion and Hypocrisy; and how many distressing gloomy Days I have had GOD only knows: but <HI>Satan</HI> could not keep, <HI>them</HI>; for a faithful GOD would not suffer me to be tempted above that I was a∣ble, but made way for my escape.</P>
<P>Sometimes He has permitted the <HI>Remains</HI> of <HI>indwelling Corruption</HI> to rally all its Force and strive for Mastery; but at the same time stir'd up an inveterate Hatred and an Abhorrance of it, and myself for it, because 'tis the abominable Thing which His Soul hates. And sometimes <HI>Unbelief,</HI> has so far prevailed, that I have cry'd out <HI>I shall-one Day perish by the Hands of these Enemies,</HI> or I shall at least fall <HI>fouly</HI> to the Dis∣honor of the dear Name by which I am called, if not <HI>finally.</HI> But for <HI>more than Sixteen Years</HI> has GOD preserv'd me from open scandalous Sins. (Yea, blessed be <HI>God,</HI> thro' restraining Grace, all my Life long,) and from ever making a League with Sin, since I have thro' Grace proclaim'd War with it: And by Grace assisting I am determin'd never to lay down my Arms, but to fight till I die, under the Banner of <HI>the great Captain of my Salvation</HI>: Yea, and Truth and Veracity itself has said, <HI>Sin shall not have Dominion over you,</HI> and <HI>my Grace shall be suffcient for you.</HI> And here (my Dear,) my great Strength lies: For <HI>all the Promises are Yea and Amen in</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="007523_0009_102BA02E20104080"/>
CHRIST JESUS: And since <HI>my</HI> LORD is mine, <HI>all</HI> is mine, and I shall come off more than a Conque∣ror thro' Him that has loved me and given himself for me. Tho' now I groan under <HI>a Body of Sin and Death</HI>; and may I never cease to mourn, but daily look on Him whom I have pierc'd: Oh it was <HI>Sin, my Sin,</HI> that pierc'd his sacred Head and Side, that put all the bitter Ingredients into the Cup, that extorted that heart-piercing Cry from him, <HI>My God my God, why hast thou forsaken me</HI>: And never does it appear more odious, than when I am well satisfied it never will prove my Ruin. GOD disposes me to choose any Affliction, or all the Affictions in this World rather than <HI>Sin.</HI> I do esteem it the worst of E∣vils; yea I had rather have all the Furies of Hell let loose to perplex me, than to be given over to the <HI>Tyranny</HI> of <HI>my own</HI> inbred <HI>Lusts,</HI> and <HI>Corrup∣tions.</HI> O thanks be to GOD, He has said, <HI>I will subdue your Inquities!</HI> Oh how sweet here to consider CHRIST as my <HI>King,</HI> that will e're long set his Foot on the Necks of these Enemies! how sweet to espouse his Cause! bring forth the Traytors, and entreat him to slay every one that says they will not have him to reign over them! Oh that CHRIST would intirely possess his rightful Throne in my Soul, wholly sway the Sceptre there, fill every Room; that not a Lust, a Usurper, might ever dare to lift up its venemous Head a∣gain! O transporting Thought; one Everlasting Day, this shall be the happy Case!</P>
<P>Again, GOD causes me <HI>to love his Image</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="007523_0010_102BA02FB3E72BA0"/>
wherever I see it; in <HI>Strangers,</HI> in <HI>Rich,</HI> in <HI>Poor,</HI> in <HI>Bond</HI> or <HI>Free,</HI> of <HI>what Denomination soever.</HI> Surely I do esteem the <HI>Saints,</HI> the <HI>excellent of the Earth,</HI> and <HI>they are my Delight.</HI> Again, God enables me to <HI>love my Enemies,</HI> to forgive Injuries, and earnesty to pray that God would forgive them also. But I must not innumerate more.</P>
<P>But <HI>these,</HI> my dear Friend, are what I call <HI>Evidences</HI> of a <HI>Work of Grace</HI>: and for my part I had rather be able to read them, than to hear a Voice from Heaven telling me, <HI>I am a Child of</HI> GOD. If you ask again, <HI>if I can always, or of myself read them to my Satisfaction?</HI> I <HI>answer,</HI> without CHRIST I can do nothing; I am not suf∣ficient for one good Thought; all my sufficien∣cy is of GOD: But GOD has taught me to live <HI>more</HI> by <HI>Faith,</HI> and <HI>less</HI> by <HI>Sense,</HI> than I us'd to do; and therefore if he hide his Face, I do not immediately raze Foundations as formerly, and draw up hard Conclusions against myself: But having treasur'd up the <HI>Experiences of many Years,</HI> I repair to them in a dark and cloudy Day, and find, <HI>thus, and thus,</HI> GOD <HI>has done for me, and appear'd for my Help in Times past:</HI> and this as an Anchor holds me sure, and He will in his own time return, and revive me; He has begun that good Work in me, that he will carry on till the the Day of JESUS; HE was the <HI>Author,</HI> and he will be the <HI>Finisher</HI> of <HI>my Faith:</HI> And so he makes me hang on the <HI>Faithfulness</HI> of a <HI>Covenant-</HI>GOD, who will not deceive nor make any ashamed of their Hope, that put their Trust in him.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="007523_0011_102BA032996CBE48"/>And now my dear, dear Friend, I have given you the <HI>Reason</HI> of the <HI>Hope</HI> that is in me: And judge you, are <HI>These all</HI> the <HI>Effects</HI> of <HI>Nature, Gifts, Imagination,</HI> or a <HI>common Work</HI> of the SPIRIT? Will any or all of these latter thus de∣termine the Soul for GOD? Will they <HI>enamour</HI> the Soul with his <HI>Beauty,</HI> because holy, just, faith∣ful, powerful, &amp;c.; and make it even break with <HI>Longings</HI> after a <HI>conformity</HI> to Him? Will they cause it to cry out, <HI>whom have I in Heaven but</HI> THEE; and make it rejoice—because even the brightest <HI>Seraph</HI> nor all the <HI>Angelick Host</HI> shall never be able to divert it one Moment throughout Eternity from GOD; but HE shall be in all, the Heaven of Heaven itself? Will <HI>Nature</HI> ab∣hor and dread <HI>Hypocrisy,</HI> and always cause the Soul when it has any Sense of divine Things to tremble at the very Thoughts of it, and earnestly to plead with God to search and try it, if there is <HI>any Guile,</HI> or <HI>Reservation,</HI> or any <HI>false Way</HI> in it? Yea will <HI>Nature lay the Said open</HI> and cause it to <HI>plead</HI> with GOD that his all-piercing Eye may penetrate into the most secret Rocesses? Yea, and <HI>rejoice</HI> that it does so? Will <HI>Nature</HI> welcome Death <HI>the King of Terors,</HI> purely because it will deliver the Soul from <HI>Sin</HI> and usher it into the <HI>immediate Presence of</HI> GOD; when no outward Difficulties make it desire Death, but GOD in his Providence makes Things comfortable and easy?—Again, will <HI>Nature</HI> cause <HI>all things below</HI> to appear <HI>very Vanity,</HI> and less than Nothing <HI>compared</HI> with <HI>Communion</HI> with
<PB N="12" REF="007523_0012_102BA034B3834950"/>
GOD, even here; and cause it to <HI>deprecate</HI> and <HI>tremble</HI> at the Thought of any <HI>unsanctified Pros∣perity</HI>; and <HI>absolutely to refuse,</HI> accepting of <HI>any or all Creature Comforts,</HI> as <HI>any Part</HI> of its <HI>Por∣tion,</HI> or in the <HI>room</HI> of <HI>one Degree</HI> of <HI>sanctifying Grace:</HI> May not the Soul in this Case say, <HI>There is none upon Earth I desire besides</HI> THEE—; Or∣dinances, and Providences are all empty without Thee; and I will not let thee go, I will not be comforted except thou comfort me? Yea, tho' Thou slay me, I will trust in Thee, byline Grace as∣sisting: And leaving the Things that are behind, I am determin'd to press after as great <HI>Discoveries</HI> of CHRIST, and <HI>Degrees</HI> of <HI>Sanctification,</HI> as 'tis pos∣sible for a mortal, finite Creature to attain in this imperfect State; since Grace is absolutely free and sovereign, and not bestow'd for any Worth or Wor∣thiness in the <HI>Object,</HI> but for JESUS his sake alone.</P>
<P>Surely <HI>This</HI> is a <HI>Work</HI> of <HI>Almighty Power</HI> and <HI>Victorious Grace!</HI> May GOD have all the Glory! But methinks I see you wondering that I attempt to write in <HI>so positive a Strain</HI>; and with all, your tender Heart misgives you, and you fear least I am influenced by Self-confidence, Pride, Ostentation, or vain Glory: and would to GOD, I dare tell you that I had no Remains of these odious Sins in me; but doubtless cleave they will, to my best Performances as long as I live in this World. However I trust thro' Grace, <HI>That</HI> is not the Motive which has constrain'd me thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to communicate my <HI>Experiences</HI> to <HI>You.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but to vindicate the Honour and Glory of the
<PB N="13" REF="007523_0013_102BA0378F0BF1A8"/>
great GOD, whom <HI>Satan</HI> has, dar'd to slander, and reproach with his Lyes; to bear a Testimony for GOD, that I know Him to be Truth and Faithfulness in the Abstract, and far to exceed all that ever I could ask or think; and again to de∣clare, that had I a Thousand precious Souls, I would venture them all on his Truth and Veracity, and cling to him: I will in Defiance of <HI>Satan</HI> and all his combin'd Legions, so long as GOD holds me by the Bonds of his <HI>Spirit.</HI> When GOD him∣self rends my Hope from me I'll let it go; but not till then: And if 'tis the Hope of the Hypo∣crite, may it go this Moment! And well may I say so long as GOD holds me: For I know as∣suredly, 'tis by <HI>Grace,</HI> and <HI>Grace only</HI> I stand. For so vile am I of myself, that should he with∣hold <HI>it,</HI> I should wander from Him as far as Hell itself, notwithstanding all He has done for me. Whereof, then have I to boast? Oh blessed be GOD, Boasting is forever excluded! Oh may the Crown be set on JESUS his Head; while I lay my Mouth in the Dust, and acknowledge I am an unprofitable Servant, and utterly unworthy of all the Mercy he has shew'd to me.</P>
<P>I intreat you not to conclude from what I have wrote, that I have any desire to establish <HI>Assu∣rance</HI> as the Essence of saving Faith; or to set up <HI>my Experiences</HI> as a Standard. No, no, far be that from me. I know GOD by his SPIRIT works variously with his Children. But as to the <HI>Essen∣tial</HI> and <HI>Fundamental</HI> Parts, I trust you will find them agreable to the <HI>Scripture.</HI> Try them by
<PB N="14" REF="007523_0014_102BA03AE71704E0"/>
<HI>That's to the Law and to the Testimony</HI>; if they agree not with <HI>that,</HI> reject them immediately, as false, delusive, imaginary, and have no light in them. But if you find they are <HI>genuine Cha∣racters</HI> of a <HI>saving Work</HI> wrought by almighty Power in the Soul; Discern I pray thee whose Signet, Braslets, and Staff are these. Can you not lay Claim to them, and say, surely GOD has done, thus and thus for me also? Or if you dare not lay Claim; dare you deny, dare you say, GOD has <HI>not convinced</HI> you of <HI>Sin,</HI> and <HI>your abso∣ute Need of a</HI> SAVIOUR? Has he not <HI>determin'd</HI> you for Himself? Do you not <HI>Choose</HI> Him for your Everlasting <HI>Portion</HI>? Do not for a World say, you do not: I trust you dare not say so. Well, if you ever have CHOSE GOD, for <HI>your all</HI>; renew your Choice, fly to him again, give up yourself, and all your vast Concerns into his Hands, thro' the <HI>Mediator</HI>; and I doubt not but you will derive Strength from the <HI>Head</HI> of all gracious Influences. Oh say not, <HI>you cannot</HI>; but <HI>try</HI> to <HI>sretch forth the wither'd Hand,</HI> and it will be whole! Oh touch but the Hem of his Garment, and all shall be well! Oh lay your im∣potent needy Soul by the <HI>Pool,</HI> and I trust the <HI>Angel</HI> of <HI>the Everlasting Covenant</HI> will e'er long descend, and make you whole and restore to you the Joys of his Salvation! And thus perhaps you'll see, tho' now they are clouded that you have the Evidences of Grace in you; that you do hate <HI>Sin</HI> as Sin; that you do love <HI>Holiness</HI> for its own sake, and GOD because an holy God; that
<PB N="15" REF="007523_0015_102BA03D977E4458"/>
you love his Law, and long perfectly to obey; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you do prize CHRIST as a KING, as well as <HI>Sa∣viour</HI> that you do love <HI>his Image</HI> in <HI>his Children</HI>; that you do love <HI>your Enemies</HI>; and are wean'd from <HI>this World,</HI> and all its trifling Enjoyments: that you are reaching after <HI>greater Degress sanctifying Grace.</HI></P>
<P>I know you will forgive me, if I intrude on your Patience in this long <HI>Epistle,</HI> and all my Freedoms herein; since <HI>it</HI> proceeds from a Heart full of tender Concern for You, and wanted vent. Oh may <HI>God</HI> refresh you by <HI>it,</HI> and lift up the Light of his Countenance upon you! And I beg you, <HI>pray for me,</HI> that I enter not into Temp∣tation: For tho' I have for sometime thro' sur∣prizing Grace, walk'd up and down in Light of GOD's Countenance; I am yet in my Enemy's Country; a Thousand Snares await me from within and without; I have not yet put off the Harness, and perhaps comparatively but girding it on; and tho' the <HI>House</HI> built upon the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI>▪ CHRIST JESUS fall not; yet I have no Exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>∣tion, but that the Rain will descend, the Floods come the Winds blow and beat upon it. Oh pray, that I may glorify GOD, in every Condition, and State of Life, and all is well.</P>
<P>This long Letter, my dear Friend, I commit to your Care and Prudence, as the very Secrets of my Soul, and as a Token of my sincere of Affection, and Esteem for you, as my very dear, dear Friend: Which pray accept, with hearty Regards to you, and all dear to you.—Pray write to me as soon as you can—<HI>Your's Heartily.</HI></P>
