<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>MATTHIAS GOTLEIB was born in Prussia, and early in life en∣gaged as a Soldier, and went through various scenes common to that calling, which we think not worth relating here: One thing however, he was re∣markable for deserting his post and ar∣my, and listing again from time to time, 'till he came to America, during the late war with Britain. After set∣tling and moving several times, he came to Newton, in New-Jersey, where he perpetrated the following act, of murdering his wife.</P>
<P>"On the 19th day of December, 1795, he was about the village as usu∣al, and returned home intoxicated; his wife being displeased to see him in that situation, began to find fault with his conduct—he immediately got his
<PB N="3" REF="030607_0003_0FE81C4051262EB8"/>
butcher-knife, and asked his son for a whet-stone, but the boy's mother or∣dered him to his work, which he o∣beyed. Gotleib then whet his knife on a board, and proceeded to stab his wife; he gave her three seperate stabs, one of which proved to be mortal, by passing through one of her intestines. He then attempted to make his escape, but was apprehended and confined in prison. The unfortunate woman died the fifth day following, and a Coroner's inquest sat over her body, of twenty-three good and lawful men; four sur∣geons were called to dissect and exa∣mine the body, and gave their opinion thereon—after the jurors had heard the testimony of the surgeons and witnes∣ses, they found a verdict of wilful mur∣der, committed by the hand of Mat∣thias Gotleib. He continued in Jail 'till October 1796, when he was tried and convicted, by the most positive e∣vidence, and executed accordingly.</P>

<P>THE words that I have chosed on this occasion, as the foundation of the following discourse, are recorded in
<Q><BIBL><HI>Genesis, IX, 6.</HI></BIBL>
<HI>"Whoso sheddeth mans blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.</HI></Q></P>
<P>IT appears from the latter clause of our text, that man was in his original formation, like his Maker, in some good degree; his being in the image of God, must denote his bearing some resemblance to God, is his perfections—as we find some traces in man's paradisiacal state of holiness, rec∣titude and happiness.</P>
<P>THUS man was a noble creature, when he came from the hands of his Creator—endowed with superior faculties of mind and traquility of disposition. Thus by creation all men are brethren and all nations of one blood; and indeed there are many considerations which should make us protect and love each other, as belonging to one great family—this appears not only from creation, but by Providence, which provides abundantly for us all; especially, considering our∣selves as christians, our obligations are still stronger, to love and protect each other. But these considerations have not been kept in view, nor attended to—and many of the hu∣man species have given themselves up to blood-shed and mur∣der, ever since the seduction of our first parents. Soon after the fall, we find wicked Cain murdering his righteous bro∣ther Abel. A bare catalogue of those individuals that have murdered each other, from that period to this, would form a large volume. But God has declared, whoso sheddeth mans blood, by man shall his blood be shed.</P>
<P>IN farther prosecuting this subject, I shall
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. STATE a number of those sins which ends in death, ei∣ther temporal or eternal, except repentance takes place in the heart.</ITEM>

<ITEM><PB N="5" REF="030607_0005_0FE81C481E0D63D0"/>III. MAKE an improvement suitable to the present oc∣casion.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>AND first of those sins that end in death without repent∣ance.</P>
<P>BLASPHEMY against God and profane swearing, although disregarded by many, not being punished generally by the laws of man; but God who is jealous of his glory, has strictly forbidden it, those who are guilty of this vile prac∣tice, may remember that they are accountable to the great legislator of the universe, under whose government, without repentance, they must be punished with eternal death. Neg∣lecting or despising of the Sabbath, subjects every ridiculer of that sacred day, to the just indignation of God, who is despised by these profane scoffers.</P>
<P>THE despising of relative duties, come under the penalty of the divine law; as disobedience to parents, turbulence to superiors, faction and discord in society without just cause; to which we may add, stealing, which is punishable by our laws, together with adultery, which tends to destroy the good order of society, and was by the Jews punished with stoneing to death, by the Congregation: Although now des∣pised by the vicious, will tend to their final ruin, unless sin∣cere repentance takes place in the heart.</P>
<P>IN this catalogue of sins, lying and drunkenness, should not be considered as the least criminal; lying is not only odious, but tends to deface all truth, and the ascertaining of facts; drunkenness gradually undermines and ruins the best constitution, it expends what Providence has allowed us, and frequently causes poor families to suffer.</P>
<P>AND here murder comes in a strong point of light. Mur∣der is base and unnatural, it is invading the prerogative of God's government; right of human society, the perpetra∣tors ought to be considered as the enemies of God and man.</P>
<P>WE learn from the holy scriptures, how a just God, will deal with those abominable sinners.</P>
<P>MURDERERS, whoremongers, and all lyers, shall have their
<PB N="6" REF="030607_0006_0FE81C49A9C7A208" MS="y"/>
part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rev.</HI> 21.8.</NOTE></P>
<P>ALL wilful sin, of whatever kind, leads to misery here, and misery hereafter, banishment from all good, and con∣finement to all evil.</P>
<P>THIS brings us to the second proposition.</P>
<P N="2">II. WHICH was to shew the propriety of that law of God and man, that annexes death to murder.</P>
<P N="1">1. SEVERITY is indispensibly necessary, from the heinous∣ness and nature of this crime. It is a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ys considered among the blackest of crimes, to murder a fellow creature; to mark it with the greatest disgrace and shame, to deter o∣thers from the like offence. If this was not the case, mas∣sacres would become more frequent, and no man's life would be in any degree of safety.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT must be right and proper; as it comes from God, who is all perfection, wisdom, power, justice, and mercy: His wisdom has fired upon this punishment, who knows the whole nature of man.</P>
<P>THE power of that God, who made all worlds, is able to discover and have it punished; hence murder, by some mean or other, is generally found out; yes always, for if not in this world, it will surely be in the next. For justice must be executed, and mercy itself does not forbid it; for the same God that has declared, that, he that sheddeth mans blood, by man shall his blood be shed, is all mercy as well as justice.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE propriety of this, appears from its having been so general, in most of the nations of the earth, publicly exe∣cute murderers; yes, many that are unacquainted with the scriptures. To confirm our opinion, we have the sence of ancient and modern nations; of so many millions of wise Legislators and great Philosophers. The wise king of Israel, says, in the multitude of counsellors, there is safety—and in∣deed it appears so, from the reason and nature of things;
<PB N="7" REF="030607_0007_0FE81C4FE440BF18"/>
that he who takes the life of another unjustly, shall loose or forfeit his own in consequence of it. It is necessary for the preservation of the unalienable rights of society, that every man should be protected by the laws of his county; and if any body of law-givers, should alleviate this punishment, who would be willing to be a citizen of that community.</P>
<P N="3">3. AS we are fully convinced, of the propriety and jus∣tice of this law, as it has its sanction from God and man; we should not hesitate to do our duty in our several depart∣ments, to see the law put in full execution, notwithstanding our feelings of sympathy—for a law, however just and righ∣teous, if not put in force, proves no avail, but hardens and increases the offenders.</P>
<P>THIS brings us to make an improvement, suitable to the present occasion.</P>
<P N="1">1. WE may learn from this subject, the danger of all sin, as it leads to death temporal or eternal—God is holy, and all sin is detestable in his sight, and must be punished here or hereafter; and if repentance is not exercised, both in some instances.</P>
<P N="2">2. WE may learn from this subject, the danger of smaller sins, as they lead to greater, till the conscience becomes feared, and no crime is too great to perpetrate.</P>
<P>PERHAPS few, who are brought to the gallows, for wilful murder, but what advance from stealing, lying, drunken∣ness, and various wicked practices, till at last they imbrue their hands in human blood.</P>
<P N="3">3. WE might take notice, from the circumstances before us, the degrees of wickedness, in murder itself. Is it sinful to murder a stranger? A distant relation? It is still more so to murder a brother, a sister, a child! In a higher degree, it is abominable to murder a Father or Mother; but above all, a bosom companion—a wife—the partner of our joys— the soother of our miseries! Especially the husband, the pro∣tector, turning into the butcher, is horrible in every point of view.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="8" REF="030607_0008_0FE7EBB4F4630A90"/>4. AND to you poor criminal, do not think that we wish to insult you—no, we only wish to impress you with a feel∣ing sense of your crime, and the aggravated nature of your sins. You have robbed your poor children of their Mother, and now the law of God and man, must take your life also, so that they are stripped of their Father and Mother. May God in his mercy take care of the orphans. I hope, yes believe, you feel sorry for what you have done. Give yourself up to sincere repentance and brokenness of heart, for your offences. Pardon may be possible—God is gracious to the true penitent—plead for his mercy, in and through the merits and attonement of Jesus Christ—strip yourself of all self-righteousness and creature performance.</P>
<P N="8">8. YOU have justly forfeited your life to the state and laws of our land—you have but a few moments to live—your glass is almost run—you are forbiden to behold the rising of yonder fun again—to you it will set with eternal night—you must soon appear at the awful bar of Almighty God.—God pity and have mercy upon you.—Farewel.</P>
<P N="9">9. SHALL we close this memorable scene, without a word to the spectators.</P>
<P>YOU see that this man must now die—do not ridicule him —but pray to God to keep you from those sins which led him to this horrid act—remember all sin is detestable to God and Christ, and will come upon sinners in an unexpected hour, when ye think not—be ye therefore also ready.—Avoid all sin, especially drunkenness, which urged on this man to mur∣der his wife and companion.—Remember an intoxicated man looses much of his reason, and turns into the scale of the inferior animals; avoid particularly, the rising of your pas∣sions—an angry man is an outrageous and desperate creature. May the example before us, serve as a warning to us all.— May God give us sincere contrition of soul, for all our sins, and accept of us through Jesus Christ.</P>
