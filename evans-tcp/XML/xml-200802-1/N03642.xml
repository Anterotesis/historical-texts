<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>JOHN vii. 37, 38, 39.</BIBL>
<P>In the last Day, that great Day of the Feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying. If any Man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath said, out of his Belly shall flow Rivers of living Water.— But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>NOTHING has render'd the Cross of <HI>Christ</HI> of less Effect, nothing has been a greater stumbling Block and Rock of Offence to weak Minds, than a Supposition, now currant among us, that most of what is contained in the Gospel of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> was design'd only for our <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rd</HI>'s first and immediate Followers, and conse∣quently calculated for one or two hundred Years. ▪Accordingly many now read the Life, Suf∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rings, Death, and Resurrection of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> in
<PB REF="004451_0003_100D9E2BEC2AAFB8"/>
the same Manner as learned Men read <HI>Caesar's Commentaries,</HI> or <HI>the Conquest of Alexander.</HI> As Things rather intended to afford Matter for Spe∣culation, than to be acted over again in and by us.</P>
<P>As this is true of the Doctrines of the Gospel in general, so it is in particular of the Operations of <HI>God</HI>'s Spirit upon the Hearts of Believers, for we no sooner mention the Necessity of our receiv∣ing the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> in these last Days, as well as formerly; but we are look'd upon by some, as Euthusiasts and Madmen; and, by others, repre∣sented as wilfully deceiving the People, and un∣dermining the established Constitution of the Church.</P>
<P>JUDGE ye then, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> whether it is not high Time for the true Ministers of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> who have been themselves made Partakers of this heavenly Gift, to lift up their Voices like a Trumpet; and if they would not have those Souls perish for which the <HI>Lord Jesus</HI> has shed his precious Blood, to declare with all Boldness, that the holy Spirit is the common Privilege &amp; Portion of all Believers in all Ages; and that we also, as well as the first Christians, must receive the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> e'er we can be truly called the Chil∣dren of <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P>For this Reason, (and also that I might Ans∣wer the Design of our Church in appointing the present Festival) I have chosen the Words of the Text.</P>
<P>THEY were spoken by <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> when as the Evangelist tells us, he was at the Feast of Tabernacles. Our Lord (herein leading all an
<PB REF="004451_0004_100D9E2E4947D2F0"/>
Example) attended on the Temple-Service in general, and the Festivals of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Church in particular. The Festival at which he was now present, was that of the Feast of Tabernacles, which the <HI>Jewes</HI> observed according to <HI>God</HI>'s Ap∣pointment in Commemoration of their living in Tents. At the last Day of this Feast, it was custo∣mary for many pious People to fetch Water from a certain Place, and bring it on their Heads, singing this Anthem out of <HI>Isaiah,</HI> <Q>And with Joy shall they draw Water out of the Wells of Salvation.</Q> — Our dear Lord <HI>Jesus</HI> observing this, and it being his constant Practice to spiritua∣lize every Thing that he met with, cries out, <HI>If any Man thirsteth, let him come unto me, rather than unto that Well and drink. — He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath spoken,</HI> (where it is said, God will make Water spring of a dry Rock, and such like) <HI>out of his Belly shall flow Rivers of living Water.</HI>— And that we might know what our Saviour meant by this living Water, the E∣vangelist immediately adds, <HI>But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive.</HI></P>
<P>THESE last Words I shall chiefly insist on in the ensuing Discourse, and shall treat on them in the following Manner,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> I shall briefly shew what is meant by the Word <HI>Spirit.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I shall shew that this <HI>Spirit</HI> is the common Privilege of all Believers.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> I shall shew the Reason on which this Doctrine is founded.</P>
<P><PB REF="004451_0005_100D9E2FE0112310"/><HI>Lastly,</HI> I shall conclude with a general Ex∣hortation, to believe on <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> wherby alone we can be qualified to receive this Spirit.</P>
<P>AND, <HI>First,</HI> I am briefly to shew what is meant by the Spirit.</P>
<P>By the <HI>Spirit,</HI> or the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> is to be un∣derstood the third Person in the ever blessed Trinity, consubstantial and co eternal with the Father and the Son, proceeding from, yet equal to them both. For to use the Words of our Church in this Day's Office, that which we be∣lieve of the Glory of the <HI>Father,</HI> the same we believe of the <HI>Son,</HI> and of the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> without any Difference or Inequality.</P>
<P>THUS says St <HI>John,</HI> in his first Epistle, Chap. v. Ver. 7. <HI>There are Three that bear Record in Hea∣ven, the</HI> Father, <HI>the</HI> Word, <HI>and the</HI> Holy Ghost, <HI>and these Three are one.</HI> And our Lord when he gave his Apostles Commission to go and teach all Nations, commands them to Baptize in the Name of the <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly Ghost,</HI> as well as of the <HI>Fa∣ther</HI> and the <HI>Son.</HI> — And St <HI>Peter, Acts</HI> v. Ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. said to <HI>Ananias, Why hath Satan filled thine Heart to lie to the Holy Ghost</HI>? And Ver. 4 he says, <HI>Thou hast not lied unto Men, but unto God.</HI> From all which Passages, it is plain, that the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> is truly and properly <HI>God,</HI> as well as the <HI>Father</HI> and the <HI>Son.</HI> This is an unspeakble Mystery, but a Mystery of <HI>God's</HI> revealing, and therefore to be assented to with our whole Hearts. Seeing <HI>God</HI> is not a Man that he should lie, nor the Son of Man that he should deceive.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="004451_0006_100D9E3314CD87F0"/>I proceed <HI>Secondly,</HI> to prove, that the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> is the common Privilege of all Believers.</P>
<P>BUT, here I would not be understood of so receiving the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> as to en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble us to work Miracles, or shew outward Signs and Wonders. For I allow our Adversaries tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to pretend to be inspired, in this Sense, is being Wise above what is written. Perhaps it cannot be proved, that <HI>God,</HI> ever interposed in this extraordinary Manner, but when some new Revel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on was to be established, as at the first Settling of the Mo∣saick and Gospel Dispensation.— And as for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> own Part, I cannot but suspect the Spirit of those who insist upon a Repetition of such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> es at this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> now become nominally Christian, as least (tho', <HI>God</HI> knows, little of the Power is left among us) there need not outward Miracles, but only an inward Co∣operation of the holy <HI>Spirit</HI> with the Word, to prove that <HI>Jesus</HI> is that <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssiah</HI> which was to come into the World▪</P>
<P>BESIDES, it is possible for thee, O Man, to have Faith, so as to be able to remove Moun∣tains, or cast out Devils ; nay, thou mightest speak with the Tongue of Men and Angels, yea, and hid the Sun stand still in midst of Heaven; yet, what would all these Gifts of the Spirit a∣vail thee, without being made Partakes of his sanctifying Graces? <HI>Saul</HI> had the Spirit of Go∣vernment for a while, so as to become another Man, and yet was a Castaway And many, who cast out Devils in <HI>Christ's</HI> Name, at the last will be disowned by him. If therefore thou hadst only the Gifts, but was destitute of the Graces of the <HI>Holy Ghost▪</HI> they would only serve to lead thee with so much the more Solemnity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Hell.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="004451_0007_100D9E35C6461440"/>HERE then, I say, we join issue with our Ad∣versaries, and will readily grant, that we are not in this Sense to be inspired, as were our Lord's first Apostles. But unless Men have Eyes which see not, and Ears which hear not, how can they read the latter Part of the Text, and not con∣fess that the Holy Spirit, in another Sense, is the common Privilege of all Believers, even to the End of the World? <HI>This spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should re∣ceive.</HI> — Observe, he does not say, they that be∣lieve on him for one or two Ages, but they that believe on him in general, <HI>i e.</HI> at all Times, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all Places.— So that unless we can prove that St. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> was under a Delusion who he wrote these Words, we must believe tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we, even we also, shall receive the <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly Ghost,</HI> if we believe on the Lord <HI>Jesus</HI> with our whole Hearts.</P>
<P>AGAIN, our Lord, just before his bitter Passion, when he was about to offer up his Soul an Offering for the Sins of the World; when his Heart was most enlarged, and he would undoubtedly demand the most excellent Gift for his Disciples, prays, <HI>that they all may be one, as thou, Father are in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us — I in them, and thou in me, that they be made perfect in one</HI>; that is, that all his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ue Followers might be united to him by his Holy Spirit, by as real, vital, and mystical an Union, as there is between <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> and the Father. I say all, his true Followers. For it is evident from our Lord's own Words, that he had us and all Beli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vers in View, when he put of this Prayer, <HI>Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their Word</HI>; so that, unless we treat our Lord as the
<PB REF="004451_0008_100D9E3761996CD8"/>
High Priests did, and count him a Blasphemer; we must confess, that all who believe in <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> through, the Word or Ministration of the Apostles, are to be joined to <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> by being made Partakers of the Holy Spirit.</P>
<P>THERE'S a great Noise m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de of late, about the Word Enthusiast, and it has been cast upon the Preachers of the Gospel, as a Term of Re∣proach — But every Christian, in the proper Sense of the Word, must be an Enthusiast.— That is, must be inspired of God, or have God in him. For who dare say, he is a Christian, till he can say, <HI>God is in me</HI>? St. <HI>Peter</HI> tells us, we have many great and precious Promises, that we may be made Partakers of the Divine Nature. — Our Lord prays, that we may be One, as the Father and He are One; and our own Church, in Conformity to these Texts of Scripture, in her excellent Communion Office, tells us, that those who receive the Sac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ament worthily, <Q>dwell in Christ, and Christ in them; that they are One with Christ, and Christ with them.</Q> — And yet, Christians in general, must have their Names cast out as Evil, and Ministers in par∣ticular must be looked upon as Deceivers of the People, for affirming, that we must be realy united to God, by receiving the Holy Ghost. Be asto∣nished, O Heavens as this!</P>
<P>INDEED, I will not say, our▪ Letter-learned Preachers deny this Doctrine in express Words — But however, they do it in Effect. — For they talk professedly against inward Feel∣i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gs, and say, we may have <HI>God</HI>'s Spirit without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeling it, which is in Reality to deny the Thing itself. And had I a Mind to hinder the Pro∣gress
<PB N="11" REF="004451_0009_100D9E39D7933F70"/>
of the Gospel, and to establish the Kingdom of Darkness, I would go about, telling People, they might have the Spirit of <HI>God,</HI> and yet not feel it.</P>
<P>BUT to return,— When our Lord was about to ascend to his Father, and our Father; to his <HI>God,</HI> and our <HI>God</HI>; He gave his Apostles this Commission, <Q>Go and teach all Nations, baptiz∣ing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</Q> —By the Term, <HI>All N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tions,</HI> 'tis allowed, are meant all that should profess to beli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve on <HI>Jesus</HI> always, even to the End of the World. And accordingly, by Authority of this Comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssion, we do baptize them in this and every Age of the Church. And if this be true, then the Proposition to be prov∣ed will be undeniable. For though we translate these Words, <HI>baptizing them in the Name</HI>; yet as the N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me of <HI>God,</HI> in the Lord's Prayer, and several other Places signifies his Nature, they might as well be transl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted thus, <HI>baptizing them into the Nature of the Father, into the Nature of the Son, and into the Nature of the Holy Ghost.</HI> — And consequently, if we are all to be baptized into the Nature of the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> e'er out Baptism be effectual to Salvation, it is evident, that we all must actually receive the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> e'er we can say, we truly believe in <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> For no one can say, that <HI>Jesus</HI> is my Lord, but he that has thus received the <HI>Holy Ghost.</HI></P>
<P>NUMBERS of other T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xts might be quoted, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o make this Doctrine, if p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le▪ still more plain — But I am astonished, that any, who call themselves Members; much more, that many who are Preachers of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> should dare so much as open their Lips against it. And
<PB N="13" REF="004451_0010_100D9E3DB52DC8E8"/>
yet with Grief, <HI>God</HI> is my Judge, I speak it, Persons of the established Church seem. more generally to be ignorant of it, than any Dissenters whatsoever.</P>
<P>BUT, good <HI>God</HI>! My dear Brethren, what have you been doing? How often have your Hearts given your Lips the Lye? How often have you offered <HI>God</HI> the Sacrifice of Fools, and had your Prayers turned into Sin, if you approve of, and use our excellent Church-Liturgy, and yet deny the Holy Spirit to be the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtion of all Believers? In the daily Absolution, the Minister exhorts the People to pray, that <HI>God</HI> would grant them Re∣pentance, and his Holy Spirit— In the Collect for <HI>Christmass Day,</HI> we beseech <HI>God,</HI> that He would daily renew us by his Holy Spirit. — In the last Week's Collect we pray'd that we m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y evermore rejoyce in the Comforts of the <HI>Holy Gh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st</HI> — And in the concluding Prayer, which we put up every Day, we pray not only, that the Grace of our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> and the Love of <HI>God,</HI> but that the Fellowship of the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> may be with us all evermore.</P>
<P>BUT farther —A solemn Season is now ap∣proaching, I mean the Ember Days, at the End of which, all that are to be ordained to the Office of a Deacon, are in the Sight of <HI>God,</HI> and in the Presence of the Congregation, to declare, that they trust they are inwardly moved by the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> to take upon them that Administration — And to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se who are to be ordain'd Priests the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shop is to rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at these solemn Words, <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ceive thou the</HI> Holy Ghost, <HI>now c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmitted unto thee, by the Imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sition of our Hands</HI> — And yet, Oh that I had no Reason to speak it, many that use our Forms, and many that have witness<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d this good
<PB N="14" REF="004451_0011_100D9E4011DC5788"/>
Confession, yet dare talk and preach against the Necessity of receiving the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> now as well as formerly; and not only so, but cry out against those, who do insist upon it, as <HI>Madmen, Enthusiasts, Schis∣maticks, &amp; Underminers</HI> of the Established Constitution.</P>
<P>BUT you are the Schismaticks, you are the Bane of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> who are always cry∣ing out, <HI>the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord</HI>; and yet starve the People out of our Communion, by feeding them only with the dry Husks of dead Morality, and not bringing out to them the fatted Calf, I mean the Doctrines of the Operations of the blessed Spirit of <HI>God.</HI>—— But here's the Misfortune; many of us are not led by, and therefore no wonder that we cannot talk feel∣ingly of the <HI>Holy Ghost.</HI>—— We subscribe to our Articles, and make them serve for a Key to get into Church Preferment, and then preach con∣trary to those very Articles to which we have subscribed. — Far be it from me, to charge all the Clergy with this hateful Hypocrisy — No, blessed be <HI>God,</HI> there are some left among us, who dare maintain the Doctrine of the Reformation, and preach the Truth, as it is in <HI>Jesus.</HI> — But I speak the Truth, in <HI>Christ,</HI> I lye not.— The Generality of the Clergy are fallen from our Articles, and do not speak agreeable to them, or to the Form of sound Words, delivered in the Scripture — We be unto such blind Leaders of the Blind! How can you escape the Damnation of Hell? It is not all your Learning (falsely so called) it is not all your Preferments can keep you from the just Judgment of <HI>God</HI> — Yet a l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttle while and we shall all app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar before the Tribunal of <HI>Christ.</HI> — There, there will I meet you.— There <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> that great Shepherd
<PB N="15" REF="004451_0012_100D9E41A9D49E40"/>
and Bishop of Souls shall determine, who are the false Prophets, who are the Wolves in Sheep's Cloathing — Those who say, that we must now receive and feel the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> or those who ex∣claim against it, as the Doctrine of Devils.</P>
<P>BUT I can no more. It is an unpleasing Task to censure any Order of Men, especially those who are in the Ministry — Nor would any thing ex∣cuse it but Necessity: That Necessity which ex∣torted from our Lord himself so many Woes against the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Pharisees,</HI> the Letter-learned Rulers and Teachers of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Church.— And surely, if I could bear to see People perish for lack of Knowledge, and yet be silent towards those who keep from them the Key of true Know∣ledge, the very Stones would cry out.</P>
<P>WOULD we restore the Church to its primitive Dignity, the only Way is to live and preach the Doctrine of <HI>Christ,</HI> and the Articles to which we have subscribed. Then we shall find the Number of Dissenters will daily decrease, and the Church of <HI>England</HI> become the Joy of the whole Earth.</P>
<P>I AM now in the <HI>Third</HI> Place, to shew the Rea∣sonableness of this Doctrine.</P>
<P>I SAY, the Reasonableness of this Doctrine. — For however it may seem Foolishness to the natural Man, yet to those, who have tasted of the good Word of Life, and have felt the Power of the World to come, it will appear to be founded on the highest Reason, and is capable, to those who have Eyes to see, even of a Demonstration— I say of a Demonstration. For it stands on this Self-evident Suppositon, that we are fallen Creatures, or, to use the Scripture▪Expression <HI>Have a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> died is</HI> Adam.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="004451_0013_100D9E447A801AD0"/>I KNOW indeed, 'tis now no uncommon Thing amongst us, to deny the Doctrine of original Sin, as well as the Divinity of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> who is <HI>God</HI> over all, blessed for ever — But it is in∣cumbent on those who deny it, first to disprove the Authority of the Holy Scriptures — If thou canst prove, thou Unbeliever, that the Book, which we call <HI>The Bible,</HI> does not contain the lively Oracles of <HI>God</HI>; if thou canst shew, that holy Men of Old, did not write this Book, as they were in∣wardly moved by the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> then will we give up the Doctrine of origina<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sin.— But unless thou ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st do this, we must insist upon it, that we are all conceived and born in Sin; if for no other, yet for this one Reason, because that <HI>God,</HI> who cannot lye, has told us so.</P>
<P>BUT what has Light to do with Darkness, or polite Infidels with the Bible? Alas! As they are Strangers to the Power, so they are ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rally as great Strangers to the Word of <HI>God.</HI> And there∣fore, if we will preach to them we must preach from their Hearts: For talking in the La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>guage of the Scripture, is but like talking in an unknown Tongue. Tell me then, O Man, whosoever thou art, that deniest the Doctrine of original Sin, if thy Conscience be not sea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed as with a hot Iron! Tell me, if thou dost not find thy self by Nature to be a Motly Mixture of Brute and Devil?

of the Devil? Again, do we not all by Na∣ture follow, and suffer ourselves to be led by but natural Appetites, always looking downwards, never looking upwards to that <HI>God,</HI> in whom we live, move, and have our Being? And what is this but the very Nature of the Beasts that pe∣rish? Out of thy own Herrt therefore will I oblige thee to confess, what an inspired Apostle has long since told us, that the whole World by Nature lies in the Wicked One, <HI>i.e.</HI> the Devil; that we are no better than those whom St. <HI>Jude</HI> calls <HI>Brute Beasts.</HI> For we have Tempers in us all by Nature, that prove to a Demonstration, that we are altogether Earthly, Sensual, Devilish.</P>
<P>AND this by the Way will serve as another Ar∣gument, to prove the Reality of the Operations of the blessed Spirit on the Hearts of Believers, against those false Professors, who deny there is any such thing as Influence of the Holy Spirit that may be felt. For if they will grant that the Devil worketh, and that so as to be felt in the Hearts of the Children of Disobedience (which they must grant, unless they will give an Apostle the Lye) where is the Wonder that the good Spi∣rit should have the same Power over those that are truly Obedient to the Faith of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI>?</P>
<P>BUT to return. If it be true then that we are all by Nature a Motly Mixture of Brute and Devil, it is evident, that we all must receive the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> e'er we can dwell with and enjoy <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN you read how the Prodigal in the Gospel was reduced to follow a Condition, as to eat Husks <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Swine, and how <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> was turned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to graze with Oxen, I am confident, you pity
<PB N="18" REF="004451_0015_100D9E4A04BA57A8"/>
their unhappy State. And when you hear, how <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> will say, at the last Day, to all that are not born again of <HI>God, Depart from me, ye Cursed into everlasting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels,</HI> do not your Hearts shrink within, you, with a secret Horror And if Creatures with only our Degree of Goodness cannot bear, even the Thoughts of dwelling with Beasts or Devils, to whose Nature we are so nearly allied, how do we imagine, <HI>God,</HI> who is infinite Goodness and Purity itself, can dwell with us, while we are Partakers of both their Natures? We might as well think to reconcile Heaven and Hell.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Adam</HI> had eaten the forbidden Fruit, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fled and hid himself from God. Why? because <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ked; that is, He was alienated from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Life of <HI>God,</HI> the due Punishment of his Disobedienc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Now we are all by Nature naked and void of <HI>God,</HI> as he was at that Time, and consequently, till we are changed, and cloathed upon by a Divine Nature again, we must fly from <HI>God</HI> also.</P>
<P>HENCE then appears the Reasonableness of our being obliged to receive the Spirit of <HI>God</HI> It is founded on the Doctrine of Original Sin And therefore you will always find that those who talk against feeling the Operations of the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> very rarely or very slightly at least, mention our Fall in <HI>Adam.</HI> No, they refer St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Ac∣count of the Depravity of Unbelievers, only to those of old Time. Whereas 'tis obvious on the, con∣trary, that we are all equally included under the Guilt and Consequences of our first Parent's Sin, even as others; and to use the Language of our own Church-Article, bring into the World with us a Corruption, which renders us liable to <HI>God</HI>'s Wrath, and eternal Damnation,</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="004451_0016_100D9E4BB0DB4748"/>SHOULD I preach to you any other Doctrine, I should wrong my own Soul: I should be found a false Witness towards <HI>God</HI> and you. And he that preaches any other Doctrine, howsoever dignified and distinguished, shall bear his Punishment whosoever he be.</P>
<P>FROM this plain Reason then appears the Necessity why we, as well as the first Apostles, in this Sense, must receive the Spirit of God.</P>
<P>FOR the great Work of Sanctification, or making us holy, is particularly referred to the Holy Ghost. And therefore our Lord says, <HI>Unl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss a Man be born of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</HI></P>
<P>FOR <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> came down to save us not only from the Guilt, but also from the Power of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. And however often we have repeated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur Creed, and told God we believe in the Holy Ghost, yet if we have not believed in him, so as to be really united to <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> by him, we have no more concord with <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> than <HI>Belial</HI> himself.</P>
<P>AND now, my Brethren, what shall I say more? Tell me, are not many of you offended at what has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een said already? Do not some of you think, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ough I mean well, yet I have carried the Point a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>le too far? Are not others ready to cry out, if this be true, who then can be saved? Is not this driving People into Despair?</P>
<P>Yes, I ingenuously confess it is. But into what Despair? A Despair of Mercy through Christ? No, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od forbid; but a Despair of living with God with∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t receiving the Holy Ghost. And I would to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od, that not only all you that hear me this Day, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that the whole World was filled with this Des∣pair.

pair. Believe me, my Brethren, I have been doing no more than you allow your bodily Physicians to do every Day. If you have a Wound in your Bodies, and are in earnest about a Cure, you bid the Surgeon probe it to the very Bottom. And shall not the Physician of your Souls be allowed the same Freedom? And what have I been doing but search∣ing your natural Wounds, that I might convince you of your Danger, and put you upon applying to <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> for a Remedy? Indeed I have dealt with you as gently as I could: and now I have wounded, I come to heal you.</P>
<P>FOR I was, in the last Place, to exhort you all to come to <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> by Faith, whereby you, even you also, shall receive the Holy Ghost, <HI>For this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive.</HI></P>
<P>THIS, this is what I long to come to. Hitherto I have been preaching only the Law, but behold I bring you glad Tidings of great Joy. If I have wounded you before, be not afraid, behold, I now bring a Remedy for all your Wounds.
