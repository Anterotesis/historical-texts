<HEAD>AN EULOGIUM, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MR PRESIDENT AND GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY your unanimous vote, to honour with an Eulogium, the distinguished charac∣ter of the late DR. WILLIAM CULLEN, Professor of Medicine in the University of Edinburgh, you have done equal homage to Science and Humanity. This illustrious Phy∣sician was the Preceptor of many of us:—He was moreover a distinguished citizen of the republic of Medicine, and a benefactor to Mankind; and although, like the sun, he shone in a distant hemisphere, yet many of the rays of his knowledge have fallen up∣on this quarter of the globe. I rise, there∣fore, to mingle your grateful praises of him, with the numerous offerings of public and private respect which have been paid to his memory in his native country. Happy will be the effects of such acts of distant sympa∣thy,
<PB N="4" REF="022862_0004_0FBA9C005C67E190"/>
if they should serve to unite the influ∣ence of science with that of commerce, to lessen the prejudices of nations against each other, and thereby to prepare the way for the operation of that divine system of morals, whose prerogative alone it is, to teach man∣kind that they are brethren, and to make the name of a fellow-creature, in every regi∣on of the world, a signal for brotherly af∣fection.</P>
<P>IN executing the task you have imposed upon me, I shall confine myself to such parts of Dr. Cullen's character as came within the compass of my own knowledge, during two years residence in Edinburgh.—To his fellow citizens in Great Britain, who were more intimately acquainted with him, we must resign the history of his do∣mestic character, as well as the detail of all those steps which, in early life, led him to his unparalleled height of usefulness and fame.</P>
<P>DR. CULLEN possessed a great and origi∣nal genius. By genius, in the present instance, I mean a power in the human mind of dis∣covering the relation of distant truths, by the shortest train of intermediate propositions. This precious gift of Heaven, is composed
<PB N="5" REF="022862_0005_0FBA9C01D9A2D5F0"/>
of a vigorous imagination, quick sensibility, a talent for extensive and accurate observa∣tion, a faithful memory, and a sound judg∣ment. These faculties were all united in an eminent degree in the mind of Dr. Cul∣len. His imagination surveyed all nature at a glance, and, like a camera obscura, seem∣ed to produce in his mind a picture of the whole visible creation. His sensibility was so exquisite, that the smallest portions of truth acted upon it. By means of his talent for observation he collected knowledge from exery thing he heard, saw, or read, and from every person with whom he conversed. His memory was the faithful repository of all his ideas, and appeared to be alike accu∣rate upon all subjects. Over each of these faculties of his mind a sound judgment pre∣sided, by means of which he discovered the relation of ideas to each other, and there∣by produced those new combinations which constitute principles in science. This pro∣cess of the mind has been called invention, and is totally different from a mere capacity of acquiring learning, or collecting know∣ledge from the discoveries of others. It e∣levates man to a distant resemblance of his Maker; for the discovery of truth, is the
<PB N="6" REF="022862_0006_0FBA9C0382236CA0"/>
perception of things as they appear to the Divine Mind.</P>
<P>IN contemplating the human faculties, thus exquisitely formed, and exactly balan∣ced, we feel the same kind of pleasure which arises from a view of a magnificent palace, or an extensive and variegated pros∣pect; but with this difference, that the plea∣sure, in the first instance, is as much superi∣or to that which arises from contemplating the latter objects, as the mind of man is superior, in its importance, to the most fi∣nished productions of nature or of art.</P>
<P>DR. CULLEN possessed not only the ge∣nius that has been described, but an un∣common share of learning, reading, and knowledge.</P>
<P>HIS learning was of a peculiar and useful kind—He appeared to have overstepped the slow and tedious forms of the schools, and, by the force of his understanding, to have seized upon the great ends of learning, without the assistance of many of those means which were contrived for the use of less active minds. He read the ancient Greek and Roman wri∣ters only for the sake of the knowledge which they contained, without wasting any of the efforts of his genius in attempting to imitate
<PB N="7" REF="022862_0007_0FBA9C080626D828"/>
their style. He was intimately acquainted with modern languages, and through their means, with the improvements of medicine in every country in Europe. Such was the facility with which he acquired a language, and so great was his enterprise in his re∣searches in medicine, that I once heard him speak of learning the Arabic, for the sake of reading Avicenna in the original; as if it were a matter of as little difficulty to him, as it was to compose a lecture, or to visit a patient.</P>
<P>DR. CULLEN'S reading was extensive, but it was not confined wholly to medicine. He read books upon all subjects; and he had a peculiar art of extracting something from all of them which he made subservient to his profession. He was well acquainted with ancient and modern history, and delighted in the poets, among whom Shakespeare was his favourite. The history of our globe, as unfolded by books of geography and travels, was so familiar to him, that a stranger could not converse with him, without supposing that he had not only travelled, but that he had lived every where. His memory had no rubbish in it. Like a secretory organ, in the animal body, it rejected every thing in
<PB N="8" REF="022862_0008_0FBA9C0A18F47938"/>
reading, that could not be applied to some useful purpose. In this he has given the world a most valuable lesson, for the differ∣ence between error and useless truth is very small; and a man is no wiser for knowledge which he cannot apply, than he is rich from possessing wealth, which he cannot spend.</P>
<P>DR. CULLEN'S knowledge was minute in every branch of medicine. He was an ac∣curate anatomist, and an ingenious physiolo∣gist. He enlarged the boundaries, and esta∣blished the utility of Chemistry, and thereby prepared the way for the discoveries and same of his illustrious pupil Dr. Black. He strip∣ped Materia Medica, of most of the errors that had been accumulating in it for two thousand years, and reduced it to a simple and practical science. He was intimately acquainted with all the branches of natural history and phi∣losophy. He had studied every ancient and modern system of physic. He found the sys∣tem of Dr. Boerhaave universally adopted when he accepted a chair in the University of Edinburgh. This system was founded chief∣ly on the supposed presence of certain acrid particles in the fluids, and in the departure of these, in point of consistency, from a natu∣ral state. Dr. Cullen's first object was to ex∣pose
<PB N="9" REF="022862_0009_0FBA9C0B957DB580"/>
the errors of this pathology; and to teach his pupils to seek for the causes of diseases in the solids. Nature is always coy. Ever since she was driven from the heart, by the discovery of the circulation of the blood, she has concealed herself in the brain and nerves. Here she has been pursued by Dr Cullen; and if he has not dragged her to public view, he has left us a clue which must in time conduct us to her last recess in the human body. Many, however, of the operations of nature in the nervous system have been explained by him; and no candid man will ever explain the whole of them, without acknowledging that the foundation of his successful inquiries was laid by the discoveries of Dr Cullen.</P>
<P>HE was intimately acquainted with the histories and distinctions of the diseases of all countries, ages, stations, occupations, and states of society. While his great object was to explode useless remedies, he took pains to increase the influence of diet, dress, air, exercise, and the actions of the mind, in medicine. In a word, he was a great practical physician; and he has left behind him as many monuments of his success in
<PB N="10" REF="022862_0010_0FBA9C0DB7BC2488"/>
curing diseases, as he has of accuracy and ingenuity in describing their symptoms and explaining their causes.</P>
<P>BUT his knowledge was not confined wholly to those sciences which are intimately connected with medicine. His genius was universal, as to natural and artificial subjects. He was minutely acquainted with the prin∣ciples and practices of all the liberal, me∣chanical, and chemical arts; and tradesmen were often directed by him to new objects of observation and improvement in their respective occupations. He delighted in the study of agriculture, and contributed much to excite that taste for agricultural science, which has of late years so much dis∣tinguished the men of genius and leisure in North-Britain. I have been informed, that he yielded at last to that passion for rural improvements, which is common to all men, and amused himself in the evening of his life by cultivating a farm in the neigh∣bourhood of Edinburgh. Happy would it be for the interests of agriculture, if physi∣cians in all countries, would imitate Dr. Cullen by an attachment to this noble sci∣ence; for their previous studies are of such, a nature as frequently to enable them to ar∣rive
<PB N="11" REF="022862_0011_0FBA9C0F51816E18"/>
at improvements in it without experi∣ments, and to apply the experiments of o∣thers, in the most extensive and pofitable manner.</P>
<P>DR CULLEN'S publications were few in number compared with his discoveries. They consist of his Elements of physiology, his Nosologia Methodica, his First Lines of the Practice of Physic, an Essay upon the cold produced by Evaporation, published in the second volume of the Physical and Literary Essays of Edinburgh, a Letter to Lord Cath∣cart upon the method of recovering persons supposed to be dead from drowning, and a system of the Materia Medica. These are all the works which bear his name; but the fruits of his inquiries are to be found in most of the medical publications that have appeared in Great Britain within the last thirty years. Many of the theses, published in Edinburgh during his life, were the vehicles of his opi∣nions or practice in medicine; and few of them contained an important or useful disco∣very, which was not derived from hints thrown out in his lectures.</P>
<P>As a TEACHER of medicine, Dr. Cullen possessed many peculiar talents. He min∣gled the most agreeable eloquence with the
<PB N="12" REF="022862_0012_0FBA9C1444CA5568"/>
most profound disquisitions. He appeared to <HI>lighten</HI> upon every subject upon which he spoke. His language was simple, and his arrangement methodical, by which means he was always intelligible. From the mo∣ment he ascended his chair, he commanded the most respectful attention from his pu∣pils; insomuch that I never saw one of them discover a sign of impatience during the time of any of his lectures.</P>
<P>IN the investigation of truth, he sometimes ventured into the regions of conjecture. His imagination was a hot-bed of hypotheses, which led him to constant observation and experiment. These often proved the seeds of subsequent discoveries. It was thus Sir Isaac Newton founded an empire in sci∣ence; for most of his discoveries were the consequence of preconceived hypotheses. In delivering new opinions, Dr. Cullen pre∣served the strictest integrity. I have known him more than once, refute the opinions which he had taught the preceding year, even before the fallacy of them had been suspected by any of his pupils. Such in∣stances of candor often pass with the vulgar for instability; but they are the truest cha∣racteristics of a great mind. To be unchan∣geable,
<PB N="13" REF="022862_0013_0FBA9C1550C8CC78"/>
supposes perpetual error, or a per∣ception of truth without the use of reason; but this sublime act of intuition belongs on∣ly to the Deity.</P>
<P>THERE was no tincture of credulity in the mind of Dr. Cullen. He taught his pupils the necessity of acquiring "the slow consenting academic doubt." I mention these words of the poet with peculiar plea∣sure, as I find them in my notes of one of his lectures, in which he has delivered rules for judging of the truth of things related as facts; for he frequently remarked, that there were ten false facts (if the expression can be allowed) to one false opinion in medicine. His Materia Medica abounds with proofs of the truth of this part of his character. With how much caution does he admit the efficacy of medicines, as related in books, or as sug∣gested by his own experience! Who could have expected to have found so much mo∣desty in the writings of a physician in the 77th year of his age? But let it be remem∣bered, that this physician was Dr. Cul∣len; and that he always preferred utility to novelty, and loved truth more than fame.</P>
<P>HE took great pains to deliver his pupils from the undue influence which antiquity
<PB N="14" REF="022862_0014_0FBA9C172DEEE940"/>
and great names are apt to have upon the human mind. He destroyed the superstiti∣ous veneration which had been paid for many ages to the names of Hippocrates, Ga∣len, and other ancient authors, and inspired his pupils with a just estimate of the writings of modern physicians. His constant aim was to produce in their minds a change from a passive to an active state; and to force upon them such habits of thinking, and observa∣tion, as should enable them to instruct them∣selves.</P>
<P>As he admitted no truth without examin∣ation, so he submitted to no custom in pro∣pagating it that was not reasonable. He had a principal share in the merit of deliver∣ing medicine from the fetters of the Latin, and introducing the English language, as the vehicle of public instruction in the university of Edinburgh. Much of the success of the revolution he effected in medicine, I believe, may be ascribed to this circumstance. Per∣haps the many improvements which have lately been made in medicine, in the British dominions, may likewise be ascribed to the present fashionable custom of communicating medical knowledge in the English language. By this means, our science has excited the
<PB N="15" REF="022862_0015_0FBA9C18578A13C8"/>
notice and inquiries of ingenious and observ∣ing men in all professions, and thereby a kind of galaxy has been created in the hemisphere of medicine. By assuming an English dress, it has moreover been prepared more easily to associate with other sciences; from each of which it has received assistance and support.</P>
<P>IN his intercourse with his pupils Dr. Cullen was truly kind and affectionate. Ne∣ver have I known a man who possessed in a higher degree those qualities which seize up∣on every affection of the heart. He knew the rare and happy arts, as circumstances required, of being affable, without being so∣ciable; sociable without being familiar; and familiar, without losing a particle of respect. Such was the interest he took in the health, studies, and future establishment of all his pupils, that each of them believed that he possessed a pre-eminence in his friendship; while the equal diffusion of his kind offices proved that he was the common friend and father of them all. Sometimes he would lay aside the dista<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, without lessening the dignity of the professor, and mix with his pupils at his table upon terms of the most endearing equality. Upon these occasions his social affections seemed to have an
<PB N="16" REF="022862_0016_0FBA9C1CD43A19C0"/>
influence upon his mind. Science, senti∣ment, and convivial humor, appeared for hours together to strive which should pre∣dominate in his conversation. I appeal to you, gentlemen, who have shared in the plea∣sure which I have described, for the justice of the picture which I have drawn of him at his hospitable table. You will recollect, with me, how agreeably he accommodated himself to our different capacities and tem∣pers; how kindly he dissipated our youth∣ful blushes, by inviting us to ask him questi∣ons; and how much he taught us, by his in∣quiries, of the nature of the soil, climate, products, and diseases of even our own country.</P>
<P>FROM the history that has been given of Dr. Cullen, we shall not be surprised at the reputation which he gave to the university of Edinburgh, for upwards of thirty years. The city of Edinburgh during his life be∣came the very atmosphere of medicine. But let me not here be unjust to the merits of his illustrious colleagues. The names of Whytt, Rutherford, the Monroes, Black, the Gregories, Hope, and Home, will always be dear to the lovers of medical science. May every healing plant bloom upon the graves
<PB N="17" REF="022862_0017_0FBA9C1F6BFBFAB0"/>
of those of them who are departed! and may those who have survived him, together with their new associate, the learned and excel∣lent Dr. Duncan, long continue to main∣tain the honor, of that justly celebrated school of medicine!</P>
<P>IT remains now that I add a short ac∣count of Dr. Cullen's conduct as a physician and a man.</P>
<P>IN his attendance upon his patients, he made their health his first object, and there∣by confirmed a line between the mechani∣cal and liberal professions; for while wealth is pursued by the former, as the end of la∣bour, it should be left by the latter to fol∣low the more noble exertions of the mind. So gentle and sympathizing was Dr. Cul∣len's manner in a sick room, that pain and distress seemed to be suspended in his pre∣sence. Hope followed his footsteps, and death appeared frequently to drop his com∣mission in a combat with his skill. He was compassionate and charitable to the poor; and from his pupils, who consulted him in sick∣ness, he constantly refused to receive any pe∣cuniary satisfaction for his services.</P>
<P>IN his intercourse with the world he ex∣hibited the manners of a well-bred gentle∣man.
<PB N="18" REF="022862_0018_0FBA9C2097838030"/>
He exercised upon all occasions the agreeable art, in which true politeness is said to consist, of speaking with civility, and list∣ning with attention to to every body. His conversation was at all times animated, a∣greeable, and instructing. Few persons went into his company without learning something; and even a common thought, by passing through his mind, received an impression, which made it ever afterwards worthy of being preserved.</P>
<P>HE was a strict oeconomist of time. He seldom went out of his house in his carriage, or a sedan chair, without a book in his hand; and he once told me that he frequently em∣ployed one of his sons to read to him after he went to bed, that he might not lose that portion of time which passes between lying down and falling asleep.</P>
<P>HE was remarkably punctual to all his professional engagements. He appeared to consider time as a species of property, which no man had a right to to take from another without his consent.</P>
<P>IT was by means of his oeconomy and punctuality in the use of time, that he accomplished so much in his profession. I have read of some men who have spent more
<PB N="19" REF="022862_0019_0FBA9C221DCBCEC0"/>
time in their closets, and of others who have done more business; but I have never read, nor heard of a man, who mingled more stu∣dy and business together. He lived by rule, without subjecting himself to the slavery of forms. He was always employed, but ne∣ver in a hurry; and amidst the numerous and complicated avocations of study and business, he appeared to enjoy the pleasures of society, as if company-keeping and conversation were the only business of his life.</P>
<P>I shall mention but one more trait in the character of Dr. Cullen, and that is, that he was distinguished by no one singularity of behaviour from other men. It is true he stood alone; but this singularity was occasi∣oned, not by his quitting the society of his fellow-men by walking on their left, or right side, but by his walking before them. Ec∣centricities in behaviour are the offspring of a lively fancy only, but order is inseparably connected with real genius. The actions of the former may be compared to the crooked flash of distant lightning, while the latter resembles in its movements the steady revo∣lutions of the heavenly bodies.</P>
<P>IN reviewing the character which has been given of Dr. Cullen, I am forced to make a short
<PB N="20" REF="022862_0020_0FBA9C239528B7B0"/>
digression, while I do homage to the pro∣fession of physic by a single remark. So great are the blessings which mankind derive from it, that if every other argument failed to prove the administration of a Providence in human affairs, the profession of medicine alone would be sufficient for that purpose. Who can think of the talents, virtues, and services of Dr. Cullen, without believing that the Creator of the world delights in the happiness of his creatures, and that his ten∣der mercies are over all his works!</P>
<P>FOR the information of such of the mem∣bers of our college as have not seen Dr. Cul∣len, it may not be improper to add the fol∣lowing description of his person. He was tall, slender, and had a stoop in his shoulders; his face was long; his under lip protruded a little beyond the upper; his nose was large, and inclined to a point downwards; his eye, which was of a blue color, was pe∣netrating but soft; and over his whole face was diffused an air of mildness and thought, which was strongly characteristic of the con∣stant temper and operations of his mind.</P>
<P>IT pleased God to prolong his life to a good old age. He lived near 78 years. He lived to shew the different nature of the soul
<PB N="21" REF="022862_0021_0FBA9C2511BD36C8"/>
and body, by the increasing vigor of the for∣mer, under the gradual decay of the latter. He lived to demonstrate how much the du∣ration of all the faculties of the mind de∣pends upon their constant exercise. He liv∣ed to teach his brethren by his example, that the obligations to acquire and communicate knowledge, should cease only with health or life; and lastly, he lived to reap the fruits of his labors in the most extensive fame; for not only his pupils, and his works, had con∣veyed his reputation; but canvass, paper, and clay, had borne even the image of his person to every quarter of the globe.</P>
<P>THE public papers, as well as private letters, inform us, that he survived his usefulness only a few months. He resigned his professorship in the autumn of 1789, on account of bodily weakness, and died in the month of January of the present year; a year fatal to the pride of man; for this year Franklin and Howard, as well as Cullen, have mingled with the dust. During the interval between his re∣signation and his death he received the most affectionate marks of public and private re∣spect. The city of Edinburgh voted him their thanks, and presented him with a piece of plate. This instance of public gratitude
<PB N="22" REF="022862_0022_0FBA9C2999B26E20"/>
deserves our particular attention; as it is more common for cities to treat their eminent lite∣rary characters with neglect during their lives, and centuries afterwards to contend for the honor of having given them birth. The different medical societies of Edinburgh followed him to his chamber with addresses full of gratitude and affection. In mention∣ing these facts, I am led to contemplate the venerable subject of our praises in a situ∣ation truly solemn and interesting. How pregnant with instruction is the death-bed of a physician, who has spent a long life in ex∣tensive and successful practice! If the sor∣rows we have relieved are the surest support in our own, how great must have been the consolation which Dr. Cullen derived, in his last hours, from a review of his active and useful life! How many fathers and mo∣thers, husbands and wives, brothers and sis∣ters, whose tears he had wiped away by a∣verting the stroke of death from the objects of their affections, must have presented them∣selves to his imagination, and soothed his soul with grateful prayers for his eternal wel∣fare! But the retrospect of the services he had rendered to his fellow-creatures, was not confined to the limits of his extensive busi∣ness
<PB N="23" REF="022862_0023_0FBA9C2C96CAB780"/>
in the city of Edinburgh. While the illustrious actions of most men may be view∣ed with a naked eye, the atchievments of Dr. Cullen, in the distant regions of humani∣ty and science, can only be perceived by the help of a telescope. Let us apply this in∣strument to discover his exploits of benefi∣cence in every quarter of the world. He had filled the capitals, and most of the towns of Great-Britain and Ireland with eminent phy∣sicians. Many of his pupils had arrived at the first honors in their profession in the prin∣cipal cities on the continent of Europe. Ma∣ny of them had extended the blessings of his improvements in the principles and practice of medicine, to every British settlement in the East and West Indies, and to every free state in America. But the sum of his usefulness did not end here. He had taught the different professors in the College of Philadelphia, and in the University of Pennsylvania, the art of teaching others the most successful methods of curing diseases, and thereby he had con∣veyed the benefits of his discoveries into every part of the United States. How great was the mass of such accumulated beneficence! and how sublime must have been the plea∣sure
<PB N="24" REF="022862_0024_0FBA9C2E2BCD39F0"/>
which the review of it created in his mind! Had it been possible for the merit of such extensive and complicated services to mankind to have rescued one mortal from the grave, Dr. Cullen had never died. But the decree of death is universal, and even the healing art, is finally of no effect in saving the lives of those who have exercised it with the most success in saving the lives of others.</P>
<P>Dr. CULLEN is now no more. What a blank has been produced by his death in the great volume of Science! Behold! The genius of humanity weeping at his feet, while the genius of medicine lifts up the key, which fell from his hand with his last breath, and with inexpressible concern, cries out, "To whom shall I give this instru∣ment? Who now will unlock for me the treasures of universal nature?"</P>
<P>VENERABLE Shades, adieu! What tho' thy American pupils were denied the melan∣choly pleasure of following thee from thy Professors-chair to thy sick-bed, with their effusions of gratitude, and praise! What tho' we did not share in the grief of thy fu∣neral obsequies, and though we shall never be∣dew with our tears the splendid monument which thy affectionate and grateful British
<PB N="25" REF="022862_0025_0FBA9C2FCCBFA048"/>
pupils have decreed for thee in the metropo∣lis of thy native country; yet the remem∣brance of thy talents and virtues, shall be preserved in each of our bosoms, and never shall we return in triumph from beholding the efficacy of medicine in curing a disease, with∣out feeling our obligations for the instructions we have derived from thee!</P>
<P>I repeat it again, Dr. Cullen is now no more—No more, I mean, a pillar and or∣nament of an ancient seat of science—no more, the delight and admiration of his pupils—no more the luminary of medicine to half the globe—no more, the friend and benefactor of mankind.—But I would as soon believe that our solar system was created only to amuse and perish like a rocket, as believe that a mind endowed with such im∣mense powers of action and contemplation had ceased to exist. Reason bids us hope that he yet LIVES—And Revelation ena∣bles us to say, with certainty and confi∣dence, that he still LIVES.—Fain would I lift the curtain which separates eternity from time, and inquire, what are now his studies and employments—But it is not for mortals to pry into the se∣crets of the invisible world.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="022862_0026_0FBA9C3151A44BE0"/>
SUCH was the man whose memory we have endeavoured to celebrate. He lived for our benefit. It remains only that we im∣prove the event of his death in such a man∣ner, that he may die for our benefit likewise. For this purpose I shall finish our Eulogi∣um with the following observations.</P>
<P>I. LET us learn from the character of Dr. Cullen duly to estimate our profession. While Astronomy claims a Newton, and Electricity a Franklin, Medicine has been equally ho∣noured by having employed the genius of a Cullen. Whenever therefore we feel our∣selves disposed to relax in our studies, to use our profession for selfish purposes, or to ne∣glect the poor, let us recollect how much we lessen the dignity which Dr. Cullen has con∣ferred upon our profession.</P>
<P>II. BY the death of Dr. Cullen the re∣public of medicine has lost one of its most distinguished and useful members. It is incumbent upon us therefore to double our diligence in order to supply the loss of our in∣defatigable fellow-citizen. That physician has lived to little purpose, who does not leave his profession in a more improved state than he found it. Let us remember, that our obliga∣tions to add something to the capital of me∣dical
<PB N="27" REF="022862_0027_0FBA9C364617CC98"/>
knowledge, areequally binding with our obligations to practise the virtues of integrity and humanity in our intercourse with our pa∣tients. Let no useful fact therefore, however inconsiderable it may appear, be kept back from the public eye; for there are mites in science as well as in charity, and the remote consequences of both are often alike impor∣tant and beneficial. Facts are the morality of medicine. They are the same in all ages and in all countries. They have preserved the works of the immortal Sydenham from being destroy∣ed by their mixture with his absurd theories; and under all the revolutions in systems that will probably take place hereafter, the facts which are contained in Dr. Cullen's works, will constitute the best security for their safe and grateful reception by future ages.</P>
<P>III. HUMAN nature is ever prone to ex∣tremes. While we celebrate the praises of Dr. Cullen, let us take care lest we check a spirit of free inquiry, by too great a regard for his authority in medicine. I well re∣member an observation suited to our present purpose, which he delivered in his introduc∣tion to a course of lectures on the institutes of medicine in the year 1766. After speak∣ing
<PB N="28" REF="022862_0028_0FBA9C3710E516A8"/>
of the long continued and extensive em∣pire of Galen in the schools of physic, he said, <Q>It is a great disadvantage to any science to have been improved by a great man. His authority imposes indolence, timidity, or idolatry upon all who come after him.</Q>—Let us avoid these evils in our veneration for Dr. Cullen. To believe in great men, is of∣ten as great an obstacle to the progress of knowledge, as to believe in witches and con∣jurers. It is the image worship of science; for error is as much an attribute of man, as the desire of happiness; and I think I have observed, that the errors of great men partake of the dimensions of their minds, and are of∣ten of a greater magnitude than the errors of men of inferior understanding. Dr. Brown has proved the imperfection of human geni∣us, by extending some parts of Dr. Cullen's system of physic, and perhaps by correc∣ting some of its defects. But he has left much to be done by his successors. He has even bequeathed to them the labor of remo∣ving the errors he has introduced into medi∣cine by his neglect of an important principle in the animal oeconomy, and by his ignorance of the histories and symptoms of diseases. Perhaps no system of medicine can be per∣fect,
<PB N="29" REF="022862_0029_0FBA9C38B3524670"/>
while there exists a single disease which we do not know, or cannot cure. If this be true, then a complete system of medicine can∣not be formed, till America has furnished descriptions and cures of all her peculiar diseases. The United States have perfected the science of civil government. The free∣dom of our constitutions, by imparting vigor and independence to the mind, is favourable to bold and original thinking upon all subjects. Let us avail ourselves therefore of this politi∣cal aid to our researches, and endeavour to ob∣tain histories and cures of all our diseases, that we may thereby contribute our part towards the formation of a complete system of medicine. As a religion of some kind is absolutely ne∣cessary to promote morals; so systems of me∣dicine of some kind, are equally necessary to produce a regular mode of practice. They are not only necessary, but unavoidable in medicine; for no physician, nay more, no empiric, practises without them.</P>
<P>THE present is an age of great improve∣ment. While the application of reason to the sciences of government and religion, is daily meliorating the condition of mankind, it is agreeable to observe the influence or me∣dicine,
<PB N="30" REF="022862_0030_0FBA9C3A5CBB1270"/>
in lessening human misery, by aba∣ting the mortality or violence of many dis∣eases. The decrees of heaven appear to be fulfilling by natural means; and if no ancient prophecies had declared it, the late nume∣rous discoveries in medicine would authorize us to say, that the time is approaching, when not only tyranny, discord and superstition shall cease from our world, but when diseas∣es shall be unknown, or cease to be incurable; and when old age shall be the only outlet of human life.</P>
<P>"THUS heavenward all things tend." In that glorious aera, every discovery in me∣dicine shall meet with its full reward; and the more abundant gratitude of posterity to the name of Dr. Cullen, shall then bury in oblivion the feeble attempt of this day to comply with your vote to perpetuate his fame.</P>
