<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>I AM as ready as the most rigid Critic, to confess, that nothing can be more simple and inartificial than the plans of the following Dramas. In the construction of them, I have seldom ventured to introduce any persons <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Never, indeed, except in <HI>DANIEL,</HI> and that of neces∣sity; as the Bible furnishes no more than two persons, Da∣niel and Darius; and these were not sufficient to carry on the business of the Piece.</NOTE> of my own creation: still less did I imagine myself at liberty to invent circumstances. I reflected, with awe, <HI>that the place where∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> I stood was holy ground.</HI> All the latitude I permitted my∣self, was, to make such persons as I selected, act under such circumstances as I found; and express such sentiments as, in my humble judgment, appeared not unnatural to their situations.—Some of the speeches are so long as to retard the action; for I rather aspired after Moral Instruc∣tion, than the purity of Dramatic Composition. The very terms of Act and Scene are avoided; because I was un∣willing
<PB N="vi" REF="020534_0004_0FAFE105F91C3570"/>
to awaken the attention of the Reader to my defi∣ciencies in critical exactness.</P>
<P>It will be thought that I have chosen, perhaps, the least important passage in the eventful Life of David, for the foundation of the Drama which bears his name. Yet even in this, his first exploit, the sacced historian repre∣sents him as exhibiting no mean lesson of modesty, humi∣lity, courage, and piety; virtaes not only admiralde, but imitable; and within the each of every Reader. Many will think, that the introduction of Saul's daugther would have added to the effect of the piece: and I have no doubt, but that it would have made the intrigue more complicated, and more interesting, had this Drama been intended for the Stage. There, all that is tender, and all that is terrible in the passions, find a proper place. But I write for the Young, in whom it will be always time enough to have them awakened; I write nor a class of Readers, to whom it is not easy to accommodate one sub∣ject<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It would not be easy, I believe, to introduce Sacred Tragedies on the English Stage. The scrupulous would think it profane, while the profane would think it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ull. Yet the excellent <HI>RACINE,</HI> in a dissipated country, and a voluptuous court, ventured to adapt the story of <HI>Athaliah</HI> to the French Theatre; and it remains to us a glorius monu∣ment of its Author's courageous piety, and of the perfection of the Dramatic Art.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A very judicious and learned friend has remarked, that the <HI>Reflections of King Hezekiah</HI> breathe rather too much
<PB N="vii" REF="020534_0005_0FAFE106BAA970D8"/>
of the spirit of Christianity; for that it is scarcely probable he had so settled a belief in the General Judg∣ment. I feel the justness of the objetion, without hav∣ing been able to obviate it. I wished to convey a strong idea of this great leading truth; and have, perhaps im∣properly, ascribed sentiments to a Jewish monarch, merely because I wished to impress them on the Christian Reader.</P>
<P>The Critic and the Scholar, if any such should honour these pages with their attention, will find ample matter on which to exercise their candor and charity; qualities so natural to genius and to learning, that even the feebleness of my performance will not be able to obstruct the exer∣tion of them in favour of my intention.</P>
<P>The amiable Poet <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cowley.</NOTE> from whom I have taken my mot∣to, after shewing the superiority of the Sacred, over the Profane Histories (some instances of which I have no∣ticed in my Introduction), concludes with the following remark, which I may apply to myself with more proprie∣ty than it was used by the Author:—<Q>I am far from assuming to myself, to have fulfilled the duty of this weighty undertaking; and I shall be ambitious of no o∣ther fruit from this weak and imperfect attempt of mine, but the opening of a way to the courage and in∣dustry of some other persons, who may be better able to perform it thoroughly and successfully.</Q></P>

<L>With it, not undelightful is the haunt</L>

<L>Smit by the chill and spirit-quenching hand</L>
<L>Of blank despair. GOD of my fathers! hear me:</L>
<L>Here I devote my harp, my verse, myself,</L>

<L>Glory to GOD on high, on earth good-will</L>
<L>To man; to pour my grateful soul before thee;</L>
<L>To sing thy pow'r, thy wisdom, and thy love,</L>

<L>Of an obedient heart I lay before thee!</L>
<L>This humble offering more shall please thee, LORD!</L>

<L><PB N="48" REF="020534_0046_0FAFE127BA9A78D0"/>Wealth, as its natural consequence, will flow</L>

<SPEAKER>SAUL, <HI>rising from his Couch.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>OH! that I knew the black and midnight arts</L>
<L>'Of wizard sorcery! that I cou'd call</L>
<L>The slumb'ring spirit from the shades of hell!</L>
<L>Or, like Chaldean sages, cou'd foreknow</L>
<L>Th' event of things unacted! I might then</L>
<L>Anticipate my fortune. How I'm fall'n!</L>
<L>The sport of vain chimeras, the weak slave</L>
<L>Of Fear, and sickly Fancy; coveting</L>
<L>To know the arts, which foul diviners use.</L>
<L>Think blood, and moping melancholy, lead</L>
<L>To baleful Superstition; that fell fiend,</L>
<L>Whose with'ring charms blast the fair bloom of virtue.</L>
<L>Why did my wounded pride with scorn reject</L>
<L>The wholesome truths, which holy Samuel told me?</L>
<L>Why drive him from my presence? he might now</L>
<L>Raise my sunk soul, and my benighted mind</L>

<L>"Another shall possess thy throne, he cry'd,</L>
<L>"A stranger!" This unwelcome prophecy</L>

<L>Each ray of op'ning merit I discern</L>
<L>In friend or foe, distracts my troubled soul,</L>
<L>Lest he shou'd prove my rival. But this morn,</L>
<L>Ev'n my young champion, lovely as he look'd</L>
<L>In blooming valour, struck me to the soul,</L>
<L>With jealousy's barb'd dart. O jealously!</L>
<L>Thou ugliest fiend of hell! thy deadly venom</L>
<L>Preys on my vitals, turns the healthful hue</L>
<L>Of my fresh cheek to haggard sallowness,</L>
<L>And drinks my spirit up!</L>
<STAGE>[<HI>A flourish of trumpets, shouting,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</STAGE>

<L>If yet thou hast not quite withdrawn from Saul</L>
<L>Thy light and favour, prosper the this once!</L>

<L>Full in the centre of the camp they stood;</L>
<L>Th' opposing armies rang'd on either side,</L>
<L>In proud array. The haughty giant stalk'd,</L>
<L>Stately, across the valley. Next the youth,</L>
<L>With modest confidence advanc'd. Nor pomp,</L>
<L>Nor gay parade, nor martial ornament,</L>
<L>His graceful form adorn'd. Goliath strait,</L>
<L>With solemn state, began the busy work</L>
<L>Of dreadful preparation, In one place,</L>
<L>His closely jointed mail an op'ning left,</L>
<L>For air, and only one: the watchful youth</L>
<L>Mark'd that the beaver of his helm was up.</L>

<L>With dextrous aim, a stone, which sunk, deep lodg'd,</L>
<L>In the capacious forehead of the foe,</L>
<L>Then with a cry, as loud and terrible,</L>
<L>As Lybian lions roaring for their young,</L>
<L><PB N="83" REF="020534_0081_0FAFE14380F792E8"/>Quite stunn'd, the furious Giant stagger'd, reel'd,</L>
<L>And fell: the mighty mass of man fell prone,</L>
<L>With its own weight his shatter'd bulk was bruis'd.</L>
<L>His clattering arms rung dreadful thro' the field,</L>
<L>And the firm basis of the solid earth</L>
<L>Shook. Chok'd with blood and dust, he curs'd his gods,—</L>
<L>And dy'd blaspheming! Strait the victor youth</L>
<L>Drew from its sheath the Giant's pond'rous sword,</L>
<L>And from th' enormous trunk, the goary head,</L>

<SPEAKER>PHARNACES.</SPEAKER>
<L>YES!—I have noted, with a jealous eye,</L>
<L>The pow'r of this new fav'rite! Daniel reigns,</L>
<L>And not Darius! Daniel guides the springs</L>
<L>Which move this mighty empire! High he sits,</L>
<L>Supreme in favour both with prince and people!</L>
<L><PB N="133" REF="020534_0131_0FAFE595C6E0AA78"/>Where is the spirit of our Median lords,</L>
<L>Tamely to crouch and bend the supple knee</L>
<L>To this new god? By Mithras, 'tis too much!</L>
<L>Shall great Arbaces' race to Daniel bow?</L>
<L>A foreigner, a captive, and a Jew?</L>
<L>Something must be devis'd, and that right soon,</L>
<L>To shake his credit.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SORANUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Rather hope to shake</L>
<L>The mountain pine, whose twisting fibres clasp</L>
<L>The earth, deep rooted! Rather hope to shake</L>
<L>The Scythian Taurus from his central base!</L>
<L>No—Daniel sits too absolute in pow'r,</L>
<L>Too firm in favour, for the keenest shaft</L>
<L>Of nicel-aiming jealousy to reach him</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PHARNACES.</SPEAKER>
<L>Rather he sits too high to fit securely.</L>
<L>Hast thou then liv'd in courts? hast thou grown grey,</L>
<L>Beneath the mask a subtil statesman wears.</L>
<L>To hide his secret soul, and dost not know</L>
<L>That, of all fickle Fortune's transient gifts,</L>
<L>Favour is most deceitful? 'Tis a beam,</L>
<L>Which darts uncertain brightness for a moment!</L>
<L>The faint, precarious, sickly shine of pow'r;</L>
<L>Giv'n without merit, by caprice withdrawn.</L>
<L>No trifle is so small as what obtains,</L>
<L>Save that which loses it. It is a breath,</L>
<L>Which hangs upon a smile! A look, a word,</L>
<L>And frown, the air-built tow'r of favour shakes,</L>
<L>And down the unsubstantial fabric falls!</L>
<L>Darius, just and clement as he is,</L>
<L><PB N="134" REF="020534_0132_0FAFE59683E68900"/>If I mistake not, may be wrought upon</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>SORANUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>But the means?</L>
<L>For Daniel's life (a foe must grant him that)</L>
<L>Is so replete with goodness, so adorn'd</L>
<L>With every virtue, so exactly squar'd</L>
<L>By wisdom's nicest rules, that 'twere most hard</L>
<L>To charge him with the shadow of offence.</L>
<L>Pure is his fame, as Scythia's mountain snows,</L>
<L>When not a breath pollutes them! O Pharnaces!</L>
<L>I've scann'd the action's of his daily life</L>
<L>With all th' industrious malice of a foe;</L>
<L>And nothing meets mine eye but deeds of honour!</L>
<L>In office pure; for equitable acts</L>
<L>Renown'd: in justice and impartial truth,</L>
<L>The Grecian Themis is not more severe.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PHARNACES.</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>SORANUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thou mistak'st.</L>
<L>I only meant to shew, what cause we have</L>
<L>To hate and fear him. I but meant to paint</L>
<L>His popular virtues, and his dang'rous merit.</L>
<L>Then for devotion, and religious zeal,</L>
<L>Who so renown'd as Daniel? Of his law</L>
<L>Observant in th' extreme. Thrice ev'ry day,</L>
<L><PB N="135" REF="020534_0133_0FAFE597458577A8"/>With prostrate rev'rence, he adores his God:</L>
<L>With superstitious awe his face he turns</L>
<L>Tow'rds his belov'd Jerusalem; as if</L>
<L>Some local, partial God might there be found</L>
<L>To hear his supplication. No affair</L>
<L>Of state; no business so importunate;</L>
<L>No pleasure so alluring; no employ</L>

<L>Has yet receiv'd no form. 'Tis yet too soon</L>
<L>To give it body, circumstance, or breath.</L>
<L>The seeds of mighty deeds are lab'ring here,</L>
<L>And struggling for a birth! 'Tis near the hour</L>
<L>The king is wont to summon us to council.</L>
<L>Ere that, this big conception of my mind</L>
<L>I'll shape to form and being. Thou, meanwhile,</L>
<L>Convene our chosen friends; for I shall need</L>

<SPEAKER>PHARNACES.</SPEAKER>
<L>With our immediate motive, none, except</L>
<L>A chosen band of friends, who most repine</L>
<L>At Daniel's Exaltation. But the scheme</L>
<L>I meditate, must be disclos'd to all</L>
<L>Who bear high office; all our Median rulers,</L>
<L>Princes and captains, presidents and lords;</L>
<L>All must assemble! 'Tis a common cause;</L>
<L>All but the young Araspes, he inclines</L>
<L>To Daniel and his God. He sits attent,</L>
<L>With ravish'd ears, to listen to his lore:</L>
<L>With rev'rence names Jerusalem, and reads</L>
<L>The volume of the law! No more he bows,</L>
<L>To hail the golden Ruler of the Day;</L>
<L>But looks for some great Prophet, greater far,</L>
<L>So they pretend, than Mithras! From him, therefore,</L>
<L>Conceal whate'er of injury is devis'd</L>
<L>'Gainst Daniel. Be it too thy care to-day,</L>
<L>To keep him from the council.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SORANUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis well thought.</L>
<L>'Tis now about the hour of Daniel's pray'r,</L>
<L>Araspes too is with him; and to-day</L>
<L>They will not sit in council. Haste we then!</L>
<L>Design of high importance, once conceiv'd,</L>
<L>Shou'd be accomplish'd. Genius to discern,</L>
<L>And courage to archieve, despise the aid</L>
<L>Of ling'ring circumspection. The keen spirit</L>

<L>Who shedd'st thy blessings on the natal hour.</L>
<L>Like fairy favours! Art can never seize,</L>
<L>Nor Affectation catch thy pow'r to please:</L>
<L>Thy subtile essence still eludes the chains</L>
<L>Of Definition, and defeats her pains.</L>
<L>Sweet Sensibility! thou keen delight!</L>
<L>Thou hasty moral! sudden sense of right!</L>
<L>Thou untaught goodness! Virtue's precious seed!</L>
<L>Thou sweet precursor of the gen'rous deed!</L>
<L>Beauty's quick relish! Reason's radiant morn,</L>
<L>Which dawns soft light before Reflexion's born!</L>
<L>To those who know thee not, no words can paint!</L>
<L>And those who know thee, know all words are faint!</L>
<L>'Tis not to mourn because a sparrow dies;</L>
<L>To rave in artificial extasies:</L>
<L>'Tis not to melt in tender <HI>Otway</HI>'s fires;</L>
<L>'Tis not to faint, when injur'd <HI>Shore</HI> expires:</L>
<L>'Tis not because the ready eye o'er flows</L>
<L>At <HI>Clementina</HI>'s, or <HI>Clarissa</HI>'s woes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Forgive, O RICHARDSON! nor think I mean,</L>
<L>With cold contempt, to blast thy peerless scene:</L>
<L>If some faint love of virtue glow in me,</L>
<L>Pure spirit! I first caught that flame from thee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While soft Compassion silently relieves,</L>
<L>Loquacious <HI>Feeling</HI> hints how much she gives;</L>
<L>Laments how oft her wounded heart has bled,</L>
<L>And boasts of many a tear she never shed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As words are but th' external marks, to tell</L>
<L>The fair ideas in the mind that dwell;</L>
<L><PB N="187" REF="020534_0185_0FAFE5BFC5235690"/>And only are of things the outward sign,</L>
<L>And not the things themselves, they but define;</L>
<L>So exclamations, tender tones, fond tears,</L>
<L>And all the graceful drapery Pity wears;</L>
<L>These are not Pity's self, they but express</L>
<L>Her inward sufferings by their pictur'd dress;</L>
<L>And these fair marks, reluctant I relate,</L>
<L>These lovely symbols may be counterfeit.</L>
<L>Celestial Pity! why must I deplore,</L>
<L>Thy sacred image stamp'd on basest ore?</L>
<L>There are, who fill with brilliant plaints the page,</L>
<L>If a poor linnet meet the gunner's rage:</L>
<L>There are, who for a dying fawn display</L>
<L>The tend'rest anguish in the sweetest lay;</L>
<L>Who for a wounded animal deplore,</L>
<L>As if friend, parent, country were no more;</L>
<L>Who boast quick rapture trembling in their eye,</L>
<L>If from the spider's snare they save a fly;</L>
<L>Whose well-sung sorrows every breast inflame,</L>
<L>And break all hearts but his from whom they came;</L>
<L>Yet, scorning life's <HI>dull</HI> duties to attend,</L>
<L>Will persecute a wife, or wrong a friend;</L>
<L>Alive to every woe by <HI>fiction</HI> dress'd;</L>
<L>The innocent he wrong'd, the wretch distress'd,</L>
<L>May plead in vain; their suff'rings come not near,</L>
<L>Or he relieves them cheaply, with a tear.</L>
<L>Not so the tender moralist <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr. Mackenzie, author of the Mirror, Man of Feel∣ing, &amp;c.</HI></NOTE> of Tweed;</L>
<L>His <HI>Man of Feeling</HI> is a wan indeed.</L>

<PB N="188" REF="020534_0186_0FAFE5C14A0984E0"/>
<L>Oh, bless'd Compassion! Angel Charity!</L>
<L>More dear one genuine deed perform'd for thee,</L>
<L>Than all the periods Feeling e'er can turn,</L>
<L>Than all thy soothing pages, polish'd STERNE!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not that by deeds alone this love's exprest,</L>
<L>If so, the affluent only were the blest.</L>
<L>One silent wish, one pray'r, one soothing word,</L>
<L>The precious page of Mercy shall record;</L>
<L>One soul-felt sigh by pow'rless Pity giv'n,</L>
<L>Accepted incense! shall ascend to Heav'n.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Since trifles make the sum of human things,</L>
<L>And half our mis'ry from our foibles springs;</L>
<L>Since life's best joys consist in peace and ease,</L>
<L>And few can save or serve, but all may please;</L>
<L>Oh! let th' ungentle spirit learn from hence,</L>
<L>A small unkindness is a great offence.</L>
<L>Large bounties to bestow we wish in vain,</L>
<L>But all may shun the guilt of giving pain.</L>
<L>To bless mankind with tides of flowing wealth,</L>
<L>With pow'r to grace them, or to crown with health,</L>
<L>Our little lot denies; but Heav'n decrees</L>
<L>To all, the gift of minist'ring to ease.</L>
<L>The gentle offices of patient love,</L>
<L>Beyond all flatt'ry, and all price above;</L>
<L>The mild forbearance at another's fault,</L>
<L>The taunting word, suppress'd as soon as thought;</L>
<L>On these Heav'n bade the bliss of life depend,</L>
<L>And crush'd ill-fortune when he made a FRIEND.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A solitary blessing few can find,</L>
<L>Our joys with those we love are intertwin'd;</L>
<L><PB N="189" REF="020534_0187_0FAFE5C15DD94FC8"/>And he, whose helpful tenderness removes</L>
<L>Th' obstructing thorn which wounds the breast he loves,</L>
<L>Smooths not another's rugged path alone,</L>
<L>But scatters roses to adorn his own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The hint m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>levolent, the look oblique,</L>
<L>he obvious satire, or implied dislike;</L>
<L>The sneer equivocal, the harsh reply,</L>
<L>And all the cruel language of the eye;</L>
<L>The artful injury, whose venom'd dart,</L>
<L>Scarce wounds the hearing while it stabs the heart;</L>
<L>The guarded phrase whose meaning kills, yet told,</L>
<L>The list'ner wonders how you thought it cold;</L>
<L>Small slights, contempt, neglect unmix'd with hate,</L>
<L>Make up in number what they want in weight.</L>
<L>These, and a thousand griefs minute as these,</L>
<L>Corrode our comfort, and destroy our ease.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As this strong feeling tends to good or ill,</L>
<L>It gives fresh pow'r to vice or principle;</L>
<L>'Tis not peculiar to the wise and good;</L>
<L>'Tis passion's flame, the virtue of the blood.</L>
<L>But to divert it to its proper course,</L>
<L>There Wisdom's pow'r appears, there Reason's force;</L>
<L>If, ill-directed, it pursues the wrong,</L>
<L>It adds new strength to what before was strong;</L>
<L>Breaks out in wild irregular desires,</L>
<L>Disorder'd passions, and illicit fires.</L>
<L>But if the virtuous bias rule the soul,</L>
<L>This lovely feeling then adorns the whole;</L>
<L>Sheds its sweet sunshine on the moral part,</L>
<L>Nor wastes on fancy what shou'd warm the heart.</L>
<L><PB N="190" REF="020534_0188_0FAFE5C20587CD50"/>Cold and inert the mental pow'rs would lie,</L>
<L>Without this quick'ning spark of Deity.</L>
<L>To draw the rich materials from the mine,</L>
<L>To bid the mass of intellect refine;</L>
<L>To melt the firm, to animate the cold,</L>
<L>And Heav'n's own impress stamp on nature's gold;</L>
<L>To give immortal MIND its finest tone,</L>
<L>Oh, SENSIBILITY! is all thy own.</L>
<L>THIS is th' etherial flame which lights and warms,</L>
<L>In song transports us, and in action charms.</L>
<L>'Tis THIS that makes the pensive strains of GRAY <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is meant of the <HI>Elegy in a Country Church∣yard;</HI> of which exquisite Poem, <HI>Sensibility</HI> is, perhaps, the characteristic beauty.</NOTE></L>
<L>Win to the open heart their easy way.</L>
<L>Makes the touch'd spirit glow with kindred fire,</L>
<L>When sweet SERENA's <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Triumphs of Temper.</HI></NOTE> poet wakes the lyre.</L>
<L>'Tis THIS, tho' Nature's hidden treasures lie,</L>
<L>Bare to the keen inspection of her eye,</L>
<L>Makes PORTLAND'S face its brightest rapture wear,</L>
<L>When her large bounty smooths the bed of care.</L>
<L>'Tis THIS that breathes thro' SEVIGNE'S sweet page,</L>
<L>That nameless grace which soothes a second age.</L>
<L>'Tis THIS, whose charms the soul resistless seize,</L>
<L>And gives BOSCAWEN half her pow'r to please.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="191" REF="020534_0189_0FAFE5C2C41BBA30"/>
<L>Yet, why those terrors? why that anxious care,</L>
<L>Since your last <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Viscount Falmouth, Admiral Boscawen's only remain∣ing son, was then in American, and at the battle of Lex∣ington.</NOTE> hope the deathful war will dare!</L>
<L>Why dread that energy of soul which leads</L>
<L>To dang'rous glory by heroic deeds?</L>
<L>Why tremble lest this ardent soul aspire?—</L>
<L>You fear the son because you knew the sire.</L>
<L>Hereditary valour you deplore,</L>
<L>And dread, yet wish to find one hero more,</L>
