<P N="1">1.

<P N="2">2. They were all under one commander of figure, duke <HI>D' Anville</HI>; a nobleman of ability, skill and courage; who came with resolution to exert himself to his own ho∣nor▪ and to the glory of his king and nation, or die in the cause: And the whole armament and all their officers, both naval and terrene being united under him, had a na∣tural tendency to prevent contention, and promote the execution of every order.</P>
<P N="3">3. They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they had the best plans and many skilful pilots with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, well acquainted with all the coasts and harbours of <HI>Newfoundland, Cape Breton, Nova-Scotia,</HI> and <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> England;</HI> in particular of <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uisbourgh, C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nso, Jebu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ta, Annapolis, Casco Bay, Boston,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P N="5">5. That which rendered our case more dangerous was, that we were a long while wholly ignorant of their de∣signs against us▪ and when we had them hinted we were easy with hearing that admiral <HI>Martin</HI> was bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cking them up, first at <HI>Brest</HI> and then at <HI>Rochfort,</HI> and that we had a powerful fleet of men of war and transp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rts preparing at <HI>Portsmouth</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> to come on the expedition to <HI>Canada.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. At length they got out of <HI>Brest</HI> and sailed to <HI>Rochfort:</HI> On <HI>June</HI> 11 they sailed from this last port▪ pass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by ad∣miral <HI>Martin</HI>'s squadron unobserved, and he could not find what way they were gone: Yea, while they were coming to∣ward us admiral <HI>Lestock,</HI> with his fleet at <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> sailed <HI>seven</HI> times from <HI>England</HI>; and was as oft drove back by con∣trary winds 'till <HI>Mid September,</HI> when our enemies fleet was come to <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> and the <HI>British-ministry</HI> judging it too late in the year, diverted their enterprize.</P>

our foes a speedy passage, and had brought them on in health to <HI>Lou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sbourgh</HI>; they had come there with surprize: And with their showers of bombs from <HI>twenty five</HI> mortars. and cannon sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t from <HI>fifty</HI> brass field pieces, it seem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> highly probable, they would soon have taken the place. And then <HI>Placentia</HI> and St. <HI>John</HI>'s in <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> with all their fish and vessels would have been as nothing to them. All the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> and the neigh∣bouring places would have joined them at once, and made them <HI>ten</HI> or <HI>twelve thousand</HI> strong, besides their seamen; <HI>Annapolis</HI> would have been soon reduced, and then their mighty and triumphant forces, both <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI>▪ both by land and sea, would have doubtless come quick all along our <HI>Eastern</HI> shores, carried all before them like a sweeping deluge; and where they cou'd be stop'd, and whe∣ther <HI>this town</HI> cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d have baffled them GOD only knows.</P>
<P N="8">8. In the mean time we are <HI>this Summer</HI> exceedingly mo∣lested with our <HI>Indian</HI> Ene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> about, both in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the neighbouring Provinces: Murthering our men, women, children: carrying many into a barbarous cap∣tivity; breaking up many houses and divers villages and new towns, destroying cattle and fields of corn; yea <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ven hundred French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> destroying a fort <HI>an hun∣dred</HI> foot square on ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>western</HI> borders on <HI>August</HI> 19: Re∣ducing us to such distresses as have not been known in the present generation; And <HI>Sep.</HI> 2. we are informed, that a∣bout <HI>two thousand French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> were assembled at <HI>Menis</HI> in <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> in order to besiege <HI>Annapolis.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. Our trouble is yet increased by our surprising intelli∣gence from the <HI>six</HI> valiant nations of <HI>Mokaw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Indians</HI> above our <HI>western</HI> borders, who had been our constant friends from the beginning of these Colonies:—That the <HI>French</HI> had made them believe, they had taken an <HI>English letter,</HI> where∣in they pretend we wrote,

<P N="11">11. And lastly, about <HI>Mid September, eight</HI> ships of the line and about <HI>forty</HI> others arrive at <HI>Jeb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cta,</HI> the port of their rendezvous, on the <HI>south eastern</HI> shore of <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> one of the finest harbours of the globe; i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, which the <HI>Bri∣tish nation</HI> had utterly neglected for a course of <HI>thirty years</HI> from the peace of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> to settle one inhabitant; and in the very way to interrupt all our fishery, and even all the trade from <HI>Great Britain, Ireland, Newfoundland</HI> and <HI>Cap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Breton,</HI> to the colonies on the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ain,</HI> and from these to them: There they water, wood, refresh, ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een, re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it▪ thence take our ships, strike surprize and terror through the countries round about them. And thence deserting their design of attempting <HI>Louisbourg,</HI> they set sail with all their power towards us.</P>
<P>And thus, in the room of our long look'd for friend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from <HI>England</HI> to go against <HI>Canada,</HI> there are now coming on a powerful armament of resolute enemies; and none to prevent them or defend us against them.

<P>While we knew nothing of Danger, GOD beheld it, and was working Salvation for us.

That our enemies fleet were detained so long in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arbours of <HI>France,</HI> even to the 11th of <HI>June,</HI> though ready long before: Whereby a greater <HI>Fome</HI> was prepared fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> scorbuti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al Weaknesses and A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls, before they arrived at <HI>A∣merica</HI>▪ whereby they also lost the cooler Weather and more easterly Winds of the <HI>Spring,</HI> were kept for the Calms and Heat of the <HI>Summer,</HI> their Voyage must be lengthened, and they could not come with quite so much Surpriz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon us.</P>
<P N="2">2. That after their getting clear from the Coast of <HI>France,</HI> they should be led to bear so far to the <HI>South∣ward</HI>: Whereby they not only went from the straite<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Course, but likewise into a more rari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed Air and calmer Latitudes, which yet further served to lengthen their Voyage: And whereby they also went into more sultr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Climates, even in the hottest Months of the <HI>Summer</HI>; the Air between decks among so great a Number so closely stowed, must be more suffocating, putrid and nauseous▪ and both further weaken, and breed Diseases.</P>
<P N="3">3. That partly by these Means, partly by Calms, and partly by contrary Winds▪ their Voyage was so length¦ened out, even to <HI>ninety Days</HI> from <HI>Rockfort,</HI> that it wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the 9th of <HI>September</HI> before the forwardest of them a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣rived at <HI>Jebucta.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. That by the Means above, and it may be others, GOD was pleased to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sit them with such a mortal Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kness<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that they owned, <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rteen Hundred</HI> died at Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and most of the rest were extreamly weakened, wasted and dispirited.</P>
<P N="5">5. That by terrible <HI>Storms</HI> they were likewise so disper∣sed in the midst of the Ocean; that by <HI>Aug.</HI> 26. they had left but <HI>twelve</HI> ships of the <HI>line</HI> and <HI>forty one</HI> others, be∣sides <HI>five</HI> Prizes they happened to meet with.</P>
<P N="6">6. That on <HI>Sept.</HI> 2. at one at Noon, when they came near the Shoals of the Is<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of <HI>Sables,</HI> the most dangerous Place in all their Passage, and had but <HI>three Days</HI> Sail to <HI>Jebucta</HI>; GOD was pleased to raise against them such a violent Storm of Wind, which held all that Day and Night: Wherein one of their Transports was lost on the Shoals; four Ships of the Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and a Transport were seen in
<PB N="9" REF="015036_0009_0F958429E6384188"/>
great distress, and never heard of after, and the rest of the fleet had like to have run on the shoals in that terrible night, and were wholly dispersed: Or if they had been but <HI>three days</HI> earlier, they had got to <HI>Jebucta</HI> before the storm.</P>
<P N="7">7. The weather after the storm, was so very <HI>foggy</HI> for several days, that Duke <HI>D'Anville,</HI> their Admiral and Ge∣neral was obliged to lie off and on, not venturing to ap∣proach the <HI>Nova Scotia</HI> shore; that it was <HI>Sept.</HI> 12, before he got, with but <HI>one more</HI> ship of the line, viz. his Vice Ad∣miral, <HI>three</HI> more men of war and <HI>five</HI> transports, into <HI>Jebucta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> There being but <HI>one</HI> of the fleet got in <HI>three</HI> days before him and but <HI>three</HI> more in <HI>three</HI> days after him; his Rear Admiral with <HI>ten</HI> of the line, and all the rest yet missing. And finding his few ships so shattered, so many men dead, so many sickly, and no more of his fleet come in; he sunk into discouragement, and <HI>Sept.</HI> 15, died; but in such a condition, and so much swell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, it was generally thought h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> poisoned himself, and was buried without any ceremony. Upon which their government fell upon the <HI>Council of war,</HI> their union was entirely broken, and their counsels grew divided.</P>
<P N="8">8. That though after the storm, the <HI>Rear Admiral</HI> with <HI>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> more of the <HI>line,</HI> and <HI>twenty seven</HI> more of the fleet, besides the prizes, discovered each other and gathered to∣gether; yet the weather being foggy and thick, they did not arrive at <HI>Jebucta</HI> until the day after Duke <HI>D'Anville</HI> died—or their arrival <HI>two</HI> days sooner might have revived his spirits, and saved his life: Though they were so exceed∣ingly shattered and fickly, they were forced to stay and loose their fittest time for doing us mischief, until near the <HI>midst</HI> of <HI>October.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. That upon the death of the <HI>Duke,</HI> the Vice Admiral <HI>Estou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nell,</HI> being the chief commander, in consideration of the deplorable case they were in, proposed to return to <HI>France</HI> to save the rest of the men: But the council of war opposing and voting against him, he was on <HI>Sept.</HI> 19. in the morning, found in his apartment fallen on his sword, and the next morning died also: Whereby the chief com∣mand devolved on the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar Admiral <HI>Jonquire,</HI> who with the council of war, resolved to attack some <HI>English</HI> place
<PB N="10" REF="015036_0010_0F95842AA5110768"/>
in these northern parts, before they would think of re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ing. In the mean while, they landed their men to refresh them: And yet their sickness so prevailed, that they owned there died <HI>eleven hundred and thirty</HI> more at <HI>Jebucta,</HI> before they left it.</P>
<P N="10">10. It was also very remarkable, that while the <HI>French</HI> were so generally very sickly, and so many constantly dy∣ing, both aboard and ashore; our <HI>English</HI> captives, though compassionately tending upon and helping them continu∣ally, were so universally heal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hy and strong, that the poor sickly <HI>French</HI> could not forbear to express their wonder: <HI>Our people</HI> taken captive by them being more merciful to them than those of their own nation. And yet the sickness spread among our enemy <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> and it is said car∣ried off near half their number.</P>
<P N="11">11. In the mean time our careful <HI>Governor</HI> sends out spies and gets intelligence — By the help of GOD removes the jealousies of the <HI>Mohawk Indians,</HI> renews our ancient league of friendship with them, engages them on our side a∣gainst the <HI>French Canadians</HI>—sends companies of soldiers, who listed volunteers for <HI>Canada,</HI> to help defend <HI>Annopo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI>; Admiral <HI>Warren</HI> sends his 50 gun ship also: And then our <HI>Governor</HI> calls in most of the regiments of this province, to defend <HI>our capital,</HI> who come in with wondrous chear∣fulness: Sends express to Governor <HI>Knowles,</HI> and Admi∣ral <HI>Townsend,</HI> at <HI>Louisbourg,</HI> with the <HI>London</HI> prints, in∣forming of Admiral <HI>Lestock's</HI> waiting for a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>air wind in <HI>England</HI> with <HI>eighteen</HI> ships of the line, to sail <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ither</HI>: And <HI>Octo.</HI> 6, with advice of his Majesty's council, and at the de∣sire of the House of Representatives, orders <HI>Thursday</HI> the 16th a day of <HI>Fasting</HI> and <HI>Prayer</HI> through the Province on this great occasion.</P>
<P N="12">12. About <HI>October</HI> 10, the <HI>French</HI> council at <HI>Jebucta</HI> being sensible that by dispersing storm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and wasting sick∣ness, they are utterly disabled for attempting <HI>Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isbourg,</HI> resolved to sail and take <HI>Annapolis.</HI> And if they had staid but <HI>one week</HI> longer they would have had a season of suita∣ble weather for it. But a cruizer of their's having hap∣pily taken the express above for <HI>Louis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ourg</HI> with the <HI>Lon∣don</HI> prints, informing of Admiral <HI>Lestock</HI>'s expected coming, and the master of the vessel happily forgetting to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="11" REF="015036_0011_0F95842B65198F00"/>
his order and throw his packets overboard; they were carried into <HI>Jebucta,</HI> and opened on the 11th early in the morning in a council of war. Upon which, surprized in the utmost hurry, they pull down all their ten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, burn a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine of battle ship, with a snow from <HI>Carolina,</HI> a vessel from <HI>Antigua,</HI> and some fishing schooners, embark their soldiers; order two thousand <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> to march from <HI>Menis</HI> to <HI>Annapolis</HI>:—An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>October</HI> 13, with about <HI>forty</HI> fail, <HI>twenty</HI> engineers, and <HI>thirty</HI> pilots from near <HI>Anna∣polis</HI>▪ they came out to go round <HI>Cape Sables,</HI> and meet them there; having wrote to the court that they deter∣mined to keep the seas until <HI>Nov.</HI> 15▪ <HI>N. S.</HI> if they could not get in sooner.</P>
<P N="13">13. The <HI>next day,</HI> they seat <HI>three</HI> or <HI>four</HI> of their fleet, with their sick to <HI>France</HI>: The distemper still increasing, our captives saw them throwing their dead out of most of their s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ips into the sea, every day after they left <HI>Jebucta,</HI> for <HI>three days</HI> they continued with them. <HI>October</HI> 15, near the <HI>Isle of Sables,</HI> a second time came on a great and cold storm, which scattere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them again: Yet the <HI>next day,</HI> get∣ting once more together; and persevering in their purpose, they dismissed our captives, who that night left them lying by, and saw them no more.</P>
<P N="14">14. But the <HI>same day,</HI> viz. <HI>Thursday Octo.</HI> 16, is kept the day of <HI>general Fasting</HI> and <HI>Prayer</HI> throughout the chur∣ches in <HI>this province,</HI> on this great emergency. And <HI>that very night</HI> ensuing, the glorious GOD entirely baffled all their purposes, and put a total end to their mischievous en∣terprize. He mightily arose, and wrought a full salvation for us. He sent a more serious storm of wind and rain and hail, than ever—which held to the next day noon— which they could not stand before—which so dispersed and broke them, they could never get together again: And several ships were so crazy, and weakly ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ded, that it is apprehended by our dismiss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d captives, who were in the same storm, that some were overset, some oth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs foundered and sunk in the mighty waters And the remaining men of war in view, so shattered and di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>couraged, that they determined for the <HI>West India Islands</HI>▪ and sent their <HI>No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a Scotia pilots</HI> home, with orders to the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indian army</HI> who had march'd to <HI>Annapolis,</HI> to leave their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nter∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and get <HI>away.</HI> The scattered remnants, it seems
<PB N="12" REF="015036_0012_0F95842C24F56D00"/>
most likely, are gone back to <HI>France,</HI> abased and con∣founded.</P>
<P>In fine. It is also remarkable, that <HI>two French frigates</HI> who privately came to <HI>Jebucta</HI> in <HI>May</HI> or <HI>June</HI> to gather the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> in all the neighbouring Countries, and raised their mighty Expectations; should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail from thence a little before the fleet's arrival:—That the <HI>four large men of war</HI> who escaped Commodore <HI>Mitchel</HI> near <HI>Domingo,</HI> and sailed to the <HI>Gape Sable</HI> shore, in full expec∣tation of finding them; but surprized to hear nothing of them and in growing late in the year, should sail away but a few days before the <HI>Duke</HI>'s arrival, and entirely miss them:—And that a few days after the fleet sailed from <HI>Jebucta,</HI> arrived there <HI>two more men of war</HI> from <HI>France,</HI> with absolute orders to take <HI>Annapolis,</HI> and not presume to return without it: And being told they were gone for the purpose, made haste after them: But arriving thither, and instead of the triumphing fleet and army, the <HI>Menis pilots</HI> returning with the dreadful tidings, and our men of war there going to attack them; confounded also, they hastened away.</P>
<P>Thus, when on our solemn <HI>day of general Prayer</HI> we expresly cried to the LORD, as in <HI>Psal.</HI> lxviii.1.2.
<Q>Let GOD arise, let his enemies be scattered; let them that hate him flee before him: As smoak is driven away, so drive thou them away: As wax melteth before the fire. so let the (inveterate) wicked perish at the presence of God!</Q>
—When notwithstanding all the displays of his anger against them▪ he see them set upon mischief:—
<Q>And when he looked, and there was none to help us, and he wondered there was none to uphold us:—Then his arm brought salvation to us, and his fury upheld him: He trode down our enemies in his anger, he made them drunk in his fury, and he brought down their strength to the earth Terrors took hold on them as Waters:— A tempest bore them away in the night—The east wind carried them away and they departed: And with a storm he hurled them out of their place.</Q></P>
<Q><P>The sorrows of death encompassed us, and the flood<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of ungodly men made us afraid: In our distress we cal∣led upon the LORD, and cried to our GOD. He h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rd
<PB N="13" REF="015036_0013_0F95842CE4E2B408"/>
our voice out of his temple, and our cry came befor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him, even into his ears. Then he bowed the Heaven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and came down, and darkness was under his feet▪ H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> rode on a cherub, and did fly; yea, he did fly on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wings of the wind: He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies: Yea, he sent out his arrows and scattered them: Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered; at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils!</P>
<P>Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals of diseases went forth at his feet: He stood and mea∣sured the earth; he beh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld and drove asunder the na∣tions. I saw the Tents of <HI>Cushon</HI> in affliction, and the cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tains of the land of <HI>Midian</HI> did tremble. Was thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thy horses? But thy chariots were <HI>salvation</HI>! The mountains saw thee and they trembled: The overflowing of the water passed by: The deep uttered his voice, and lift up his hands on high! Thou wentest forth for the <HI>salvation</HI> of thy people: Thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked: They came out as a whirlwind to scat∣ter us: Their rejoicing was to devour the poor: Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, through the heap of great waters! When we heard, our belly trembled; our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ips quivered at the noise, rottenness entered into our bones; and we trembled in ourselves, that we might rest in the day of trouble, when they were coming to the people, to invade us with their troops</P></Q>
<P>The <HI>French officers</HI> told <HI>one of our masters</HI>—that when they came from <HI>Rochfort,</HI> they were <HI>ninety seven</HI> sail, <HI>thirty</HI> of which were men of war: That they had <HI>forty thousand</HI> arms with proportionable ammunition and blankets for the <HI>Indians</HI>; and the master saw above a <HI>hundred</HI> chests of arms with a great quantity of lead landed out of <HI>one</HI> ship of <HI>thirty</HI> guns which took him: That there were <HI>seven thousand North American French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> to join them: That upon their taking <HI>Annapolis,</HI> they expected <HI>righteo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> French</HI> ships of the line, and <HI>seventy two Spanish</HI> men of war would be sent early in the spring to join
<PB N="14" REF="015036_0014_0F95842DA56F09D0"/>
the fleet on these coasts; which was a matter generally believed and depended upon among them: That they were resolved to destroy the frontier settlements of the <HI>English Colonies,</HI> and had a great depend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce on getting a strong footing on this part of the <HI>North American</HI> Con∣tinent.</P>
<Q><P>But how do the heathen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>age, and the people imagine a vain thing! The kings of the earth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et themselves, and the rulers take couns<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l together. He that s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s in the Heavens has them in de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ision. He disappoints the devi∣ces of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprize: H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> taketh the wise in their own craf∣tiness, and the counsel of the froward is carried he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d long. Yea, he speaketh to them in his wrath, and vexeth them in his sore displeasure: He breaks them in pieces as with a rod of iron: He dashes them in pieces like a potter's vessel. But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty. Be wise therefore, O ye kings: Be instructed ye judges of the earth: Serve the LORD with fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, and rejoice with trembling▪ Submit to the SON of GOD; least he be an∣gry, and ye perish: When his wrath is kindled but a lit∣tle, blessed are they that put their trust in him.</P>
<P>But we will sing to the LORD; for he hath triumphed gloriously: He hath thrown our enemies into the sea. The LORD is our strength and song, and he is bec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me our salvation: He is our GOD, and we will prepare him an habitation in the highest room of our souls: our fa∣thers GOD, and we will exalt him: The LORD is a man of war, JEHOVAH is his name.

<P>But the LORD is our light and strength, our shield and our Salvation. We will extol thee O God!

Thou hast put off our sackloth, and girded us with gladness; that our glory may sing praise to thee and not be silent: O LORD our GOD; We will give thanks to thee, and praise thy name forever.</P>
<P>Yea, we will praise thee, O LORD among the people: We will sing to thee among the nations. Be thou exalted, O GOD above the Heavens: Let thy glory be above all the earth▪ Sing unto GOD ye kingdoms of the earth: O sing praises unto the Lord;—to him that rideth upon the Heavens of Heavens; ascribe ye strength unto him: His excellency is over <HI>Israel,</HI> his strength is in the clouds.
