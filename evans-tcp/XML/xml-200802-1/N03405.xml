<Q><BIBL>Rev. 11. 5.</BIBL>
Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first Works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove the Candlestick out of his Place, except thou repent.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is at the Call of the late honourable <HI>House of Re∣presentatives,</HI> that I stand in this Desk to Day; and it is my Purpose (in a humble Dependance on divine Assistance) from the Words which I have now read in this great Audience, to discourse of the Degeneracies, that the People of this Land are fallen into, and to urge all Orders of Men both <HI>civil</HI> and <HI>sacred,</HI> to endeavour a Reformation of what is am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>. I have not a Word to offer by Way of Apology, for this Design and Intention of mine.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="004153_0005_1003D683367BD870"/>Some have chosen thus to do rather than to in∣sist upon any Subject, that had a direct Aspect on the Affairs of the Day, and the Duty of the Electors to have a special Regard to the Qualities of Councellors in the Choice of 'em. And the Reason (it seems) that has influenced them, was this, <Q>Because they look'd upon it as an Impro∣priety, and altogether in vain to speak of ne∣cessary Qualities, when the Persons themselves are already fix'd upon, and (in Effect) chosen before this; and that perhaps without any Re∣gard to their Qualities, only that they are such as will be sure to answer that Party-Cause and Interest they are designed for. But this is a Reason, that I utterly disclaim, in what I am going about; and would hope quite other Things, and better Things, of the honourable Persons, that are concerned in the Elections of this Day</Q>.</P>
<P>This Book wherein we find our Text, is so full of divine Majesty, that it commands an awful Re∣verence in all gracious Hearts that read it. It was indited by Jesus Christ himself, the faithful and true Witness. <HI>John</HI> the beloved and bosom Disci∣ple, and last Apostle, was the Pen-man of it. Chap. i. Ver. I. <HI>The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to show unto his Servants Things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his Servant John.</HI></P>
<P>For the Time of his writing it, himself tells us, <HI>Chap.</HI> i.9. That it was while he was in P<HI>atmos,</HI> for the Word of God, and the Testimony of Jesus Christ. This was (if we may believe History, and we have nothing else to inform us) in the Time of Domitian the Roman Emperor, about the ninety-fourth or ninety-fifth Year after the Nativity of Christ.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="004153_0006_1003D69A4D7C5CB0"/>The Things which <HI>John</HI> describes and writes are of two Sorts, as Christ himself ranks them, Chap. i.19. viz. First, The Things that are. Secondly, The Things that shall be hereafter.</P>
<P><HI>The Things that are,</HI> have a Respect to the State of the seven <HI>Asian</HI> Churches, signified by the seven Golden-Candlesticks, visionally represented unto the beloved Apostle; for so our Lord himself ex∣pounds the Vision, Ch. i, 20. <HI>The seven Candlesticks which thou sawest, are the seven Churches.</HI></P>
<P>Now the Things which concern these seven Churches, are laid down in seven particular Epis∣tles, directed primarily to the seven Angels of the seven Churches. Secondarily, With and in them, to the seven Churches themselves.</P>
<P>Our Text lies in the first of the Epistles, inscri∣bed unto the Angel of the Church of <HI>Ephesus, Chap.</HI> ii.I. I will not here waste my Time with any Dis∣course concerning the Situation of the City of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> nor yet with a Resolution of the Context by any analytical Exposition of the Epistle.</P>
<P>In the Words before us, our Lord Jesus Christ expresses himself highly offended at the Church of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> for an Apostacy whereinto they were a∣pace degenerating. An Apostacy was the Thing complained of; and the Remedy prescribed for the Cure of that Malady, and to which this Church was exhorted, was Repentance. <HI>Remember from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first Works.</HI></P>
<P>This Repentance is pressed with a dreadful Commination, big with Wo and Misery. The
<PB N="4" REF="004153_0007_1003D6B3A7DFC380"/>
Judgment threatned, is no less than the Removal of the Candlestick out of it's Place; which means our Lord's unchurching them, &amp; saying unto them, <HI>Loammi, you are not my People.</HI> What the Lord Jesus Christ in our Text says to the Church of <HI>Ephesus</HI> is this, <HI>Repent,</HI> and by Repentance reco∣ver out of thy Apostacy; or else I will dischurch thee, disown thee, destroy thee.</P>
<P>But then in this Threatning, this Promise is strongly implied, <HI>viz.</HI> that if this Church did thus re∣pent, their Church-State should graciously be con∣tinued unto them.</P>
<P>Accordingly, from the Words, these three Doc∣trines may be observed.</P>
<P>DOCT. 1. That it is the great Duty of aposta∣tizing Churches to remember from whence they are fallen, and repent, and do their first Works. <HI>Remember from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first Works.</HI></P>
<P>DOCT. 2. That if declining Churches thus do, the Lord Jesus will graciously continue their Church State unto them.</P>
<P>DOCT. 3. That unless apostatizing Churches do repent, they will provoke the Lord Jesus to un∣church them, and destroy them. <HI>I will remove thy Candlestick out of his Place, except thou repent.</HI></P>
<P>To each of these in their Order.</P>
<P><HI>DOCT. I.</HI> It is the great Duty of apostatizing Churches to remember from whence they are fallen, and repent, and do their first Works.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="004153_0008_1003D6C5800A6FE0"/>This Doctrine may be spoken unto, under these two Heads or Propositions.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> Churches have many times been guilty of Declen∣sions and Apostacies.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> When they become thus guilty, it is their great Duty to remember from whence they are fallen, and repent, and do their first Works.</P>
<P>PROP. I. Churches have many times been guilty of Declensions and Apostacies.</P>
<P>So it was with the Church of Israel. How fre∣quently do we find God complaining of this, by the Mouth of his holy Prophets? They turned quickly out of the Way which their Fathers walk∣ed in, obeying the Commandments of the Lord; but they did not so. They were planted by God a noble Vine, wholly a right Seed; but they turn∣ed into the degenerate Plant of a strange unto him, <HI>Jer.</HI> ii.21.</P>
<P>And as it was thus with the Church of God un∣der the <HI>legal Dispensation,</HI> so it has been with many christian Churches under the <HI>evangelical.</HI> During the Days of the Apostles themselves, and notwith∣standing their wise, diligent and careful Inspection over the Churches planted by them; yet there were Declensions in many of them. And in suc∣ceeding Ages, far greater Defections from the Gos∣pel befell the Churches of Christ, agreeable to what those holy Men of God foretold.</P>
<P>Apostacies and Declensions among Churches, have appeared several Ways.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="6" REF="004153_0009_1003D6DE04B45C68"/>I. <HI>Sometimes in Matters of Doctrine.</HI> They re∣ject Knowlege, which is the first Step to Piety, and without which the Mind can't be good. They re∣nounce and forsake the Truths of the Gospel, which is the very Ground-Work of Holiness. And this they do two Ways.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>By Ignorance.</HI> A knowing intelligent People in Continuance of Time, may become ignorant at Children in Understanding! 'Twas thus with the People of <HI>Israel,</HI> Hos. iv.I. <HI>There is no Knowlege of God in the Land.</HI> It speaks the universal Igno∣rance that was among them. Babes may s;ucceed those, who by Reason of Use, had their Senses ex∣ercised to discern between Good and Evil. And this may proceed sometimes from suitable Means being withheld from a People. Family Instruction is neglected, a due Care to catechise the rising Ge∣neration in the Principles of Religion, is not main∣tained; neither are Schools of Learning for their religious Education, cherished as they ought to be; and if the Guides and Teachers of a People should prove unable, or unfaithful to teach them the good Knowlege of the Lord, no wonder if they be ig∣norant.</P>
<P>Sometimes a People's Ignorance proceeds from their own Sloth and Negligence. They will not improve the Means of Instruction, which they are favoured with. Neglect the Reading of God's holy Word; will not seek the Law at the Mouth of their able and faithful Guides; are not careful to give their Attendance on their publick and private In∣structions. Hence when <HI>for the Time they ought to be Teachers, they have need that one should teach them again, the first Principles of the Oracles of God; and are become such as have need of Milk, and not of strong Meat.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="7" REF="004153_0010_1003D6F18546F3C0"/>2. <HI>By Errors.</HI> They fall from the Truth which they have heard and received, and turn aside to lies. This in a sad Degree was the Case of the Church of <HI>Corinth.</HI> It was planted by the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> who we may be sure, kept back nothing that was profitable unto them. They were watered by <HI>Apollos,</HI> an eloquent Man and mighty in the Scrip∣tures, &amp; therefore beyond Question fully instructed by them in all the Principles of Religion; and yet many of them quickly fell into that fundamental Error of denying the <HI>Resurrection of the Dead,</HI> I Cor. xv.</P>
<P>A yet more pregnant Instance of what we have now under Consideration, are the Churches of <HI>Ga∣latia.</HI> Planted they were by the Ministry of the same Aposle; and tho' he declared unto them the whole Counsel of God, yet we may well think, that in nothing did he labour more than to estab∣lish them in the Knowlege and Belief of that grand Article of Christianity, The Justification of Sinners by Faith in the Righteousness of Christ; for this was the principal Scope &amp; Design of his Ministry, in the whole Course of it. This Doctrine was em∣braced with such Joy and Satisfaction, that they prized the Apostle as an Angel of God, received him as Jesus Christ, and valued him above the Sight of their own Eyes, <HI>Chap.</HI> iv.14, 15. And yet after all this, on a sudden, to his Surprize and Amazement, they renounced the Doctrine of Justi∣fication by Faith only, to seek after a Righteous∣ness, as it were, by the Works of the Law. Gal. i.6, 7. <HI>I marvel, that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the Grace of Chris;t, unto ano∣ther Gospel: Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the Gospel of Christ.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="004153_0011_1003D7072FDF5348"/>There are abundance of Temptations to Errors. There are Temptations from <HI>without.</HI> Satan is the grand Seducer, and stands continually ready to act his Part to the utmost, for the Delusion of Men. 2 Cor. iv.4. <HI>The God of this World hath blinded their Minds.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, There are heretical Teachers, that bend their Wits, and busy themselves in wresting the Scriptures, and venting their dangerous Errors, to the Destruction of themselves and many others. 2 Pet. ii.1. <HI>There
shall be false Teachers among you, who shall privily bring in damnable Heresies.</HI></P>
<P>And there are many Temptations from <HI>within,</HI> as well as from without. The uncured Enmity in the Minds of carnal Men to spiritual Things, be∣trays them into erroneous Tenets; and so does the Pride of Reason, rendring them unwilling to ad∣mit any Doctrines in Christianity, which are not level with it: Their vain Affectation of appearing some great ones, and the Power and Prevalency of other vile Lusts and Corruptions.</P>
<P>Many Errors have prevailed in the Church of God. Particularly, <HI>Arianism</HI> has so done, and so has <HI>Pelagianism,</HI> and <HI>Popery,</HI> and <HI>Socinianism</HI> and <HI>Arminianism,</HI> which last is, (as a learned Man observes<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI> in his Theol. Refor. Vol. 2. p. 491.</NOTE>) the second Edition of <HI>Pelagianism,</HI> Pelagianism in Miniature, and a compendious Draught of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Sometimes Churches are guilty of Apostacy in Point of Worship.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="004153_0012_1003D72707643640"/>And this several Ways.</P>
<P N="1">1. By corrupting the Worship of God.</P>
<P>And there are especially two Things, which corrupt it.</P>
<P>One is, an Admittance of Persons to that Wor∣ship of God, which they are unfit for, and have no Right unto. There are two Sorts of Worship with which Men are to glorify God: A <HI>natural</HI> and an <HI>instituted</HI> Worship. As for <HI>natural Worship</HI> (such as hearing the Word &amp; Prayer) it is every Man's immediate Duty to attend upon it. But it is o∣therwise with <HI>instituted Worship.</HI> Men ought to be prepared and made meet for it, before they attend it. When <HI>John</HI> saw the Pharisees and Scribes come to his Baptism, he said unto them, <HI>O Genera∣tion of Vipers, Who hath warned you to flee from the Wrath to come? Bring forth therefore Fruits meet for Repentance.</HI> 1 Cor. xi.28. <HI>But let a Man examine himself, and so let him eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup.</HI> Whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>holy Things</HI> are given unto <HI>Dogs,</HI> the holy Inst<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ions of Christ to such as are visibly unclean, this is to corrupt them. Ezek. xliv.7. <HI>Ye have brought into my Sanctuary Strangers uncir∣cumcised in Heart, and uncircumcised in Flesh, to be in my Sanctuary to pollute it, even my House.</HI></P>
<P>The other Thing that corrupts the Worship of God, is the <HI>adding to it,</HI> or <HI>taking from it.</HI> To cur∣tail the Worship of God, and diminish from it; must needs deprave it. And so does the Addition of any humane Institutions to it. Men are very prone to interweave their own Inventions and sig∣nificant Ceremonies into, and make them Parts of the Worship of God, thinking thereby to mend
<PB N="10" REF="004153_0013_1003D73405D1BF00"/>
it: but as this is an Invasion on his Sovereignty, and a great Reflection cast upon his Wisdom and Faithfulness; so it mars his Worship, and spoils its Beauty, and makes it to be to little or no Purpose. Matth. xv.9. <HI>But in vain do they worship me, teach∣ing for Doctrines, the Commandments of Men.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. By neglecting the Worship of God, or any Part of it.</P>
<P>And here particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Sometimes secret Worship is neglecled.</HI> Many do not yield a due Observance to that plain and express Injunction of our Lord, Matth. vi.6. <HI>En∣ter into thy Closet, and when thou hast shut thy Door, pray to thy Father which is in Secret.</HI> Nor do they walk as he walked, who was frequently engaged in the Duty of secret Prayer. Of our blessed Sa∣viour we read, Matth. xiv.23. <HI>He went apart to pray: and when the Evening was come, he was alone.</HI> And Mark i.35. <HI>In the Morning he departed into a solitary Place,. and there prayed.</HI> Perhaps something of this is done by Fits and Starts; but they don't observe any set solemn Times, Morning and Even∣ing, for this great Duty. Or when it is thus attend∣ed, yet it may be, many neglect that which is of the most personal and special Concernment to their own Souls. Persons may pray in Secret, and yet not utter a Word which is of most secret Con∣cernment to themselves, and their own Souls; but what may be expressed before a Family or Con∣gregation. And thus one principal End of secret Prayer is lost; viz. the Confession of secret Sins, and petitioning for those personal Mercies and se∣cret Blessings, which we cannot so properly and conveniently ask before others.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="11" REF="004153_0014_1003D73E59366050"/>2. <HI>Sometimes Family-Worship and Duties are neg∣lected.</HI> As the offering up the morning and even∣ing Sacrifice of Prayer and Praise; the Reading of God's Word daily; and instructing the Family by catechising, and other sutable and profitable Means, as is required, <HI>Deut.</HI> vi.7. And this Neg∣lect in some Families may be total, in others par∣tial. Family-Duties may be wholly omitted in some Families, and in others, but in Part perform∣ed. If there be Prayer on the Lord's Day, yet little or none all the Week after. If in the Morn∣ing, yet none in the Evening; or if in the Even∣ing, yet none in the Morning; or if in the Morn∣ing and Evening, yet the solemn Reading God's Word is not made a Part of the daily Family∣Worship; or if these be attended, yet perhaps a careful instructing of the Children of the Family is neglected, or not duly performed.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Sometimes the publick Worship of God is disre∣garded.</HI> His Authority enjoining it is slighted; the sacred Provisions of Sion are despised; and the publick Assemblies of God's People on the Lord's Days, as well as on Lecture Days, are not attended, as should be. Some are so far from keeping God's Sabbaths, and reverencing his Sanc∣tuary, by a constant Attendance on the Worship of it; that they are seldom there at all. Some are ready to content themselves with going up to the House of God, on one Part of the Lord's Day only. And others come very unseasonably, to the depriv∣ing themselves of some Part of the publick Wor∣ship; and the Distraction and drawing off the Minds of others, from that Part of it, which is in Hand. Men, that they may indulge an indolent Spirit, are very forward to frame Excuses, to stay away from the House of God. Light Indispositi∣ons
<PB N="12" REF="004153_0015_1003D746865A2CC8"/>
Body, small Difficulties of the Weather, and Distance of the Way, which would be easily over∣look'd, to compass a worldly Design, to obtain some worldly Advantage, will keep them at Home. So Men forsake the Lord, and forget his holy Mountain.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>By Formality in the Worship of God.</HI> A pro∣fessing People are many Times superficial in divine Worship. It is external, and not animated with spiritual Frames, which are the Soul of it. They have with the Church of <HI>Sardis</HI> a Name to live, but are dead. A Form of Godliness, but deny the Power thereof. They celebrate <HI>Sabbaths,</HI> and yet have no spiritual Rest: Observe <HI>Fasts</HI> without godly Sorrow and Brokenness of Heart for Sin; keep <HI>Thanksgivings,</HI> without a thankful Heart, or holy Rejoycing in God. They draw near to God with their Mouth, and with their Lips do honour him, while their Hearts are removed from him. They put off God with external Services, but little regard to yield him a reasonable one, i. e. directed by their Understandings, and accompanied with their Affections. To Appearance they are devout in attending on Ordinances, yet little or nothing of sincere Devotion in their Worship. Ezek. xxxiii.31. <HI>They come to thee, as the People cometh, and they sit before thee, as my People, and they hear thy Words, but they will not do them; for with their Mouth they shew much Love, but their Heart goeth after their Co∣vetousness.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Sometimes Churches are guilty of Apostacy in Point of Discipline.</HI></P>
<P>Here I might say,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="13" REF="004153_0016_1003D74B99B325B8"/>I. <HI>Sometimes there is a great Neglect of Family∣Discipline and Government among a professing People.</HI> The Authority with which Heads of Families are vested by God, is not maintained, nor exerted by them, as ought to be. Many christian <HI>Housholders</HI> don't practice as <HI>Abraham</HI> did, of whom God gives this Commendation, Gen. xviii.19. <HI>I know him, that he will command his Children, and his Houshold after him, and they shall keep the Way of the Lord, to do Justice and Judgment.</HI> They are very remiss, in exercising a due Government over their Chil∣dren and Servants. Don't rule well their own Houses. Children are suffered to frequent the Ta∣verns, get into bad Company, to ramble up and down in the Evening, when they should be at Home to attend Family-Worship; in the dark and silent Night, when they should be in their Beds. They are let alone, to run into Temptations to Sin, and take bad Courses without Check or Controul. <HI>They make themselves vile,</HI> and their Parents <HI>restrain them not.</HI></P>
<P>But then,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Sometimes Churches grow very careless in Church-Discipline.</HI> The Power of Discipline, which is Christ's own Expedient for the Preservation of Churches in Purity, is not kept up as it should be, and as it has been. "The Snuffers of the Sanctu∣ary are not regularly and faithfully used; hence the Gold of the Candlesticks becomes Dross a∣pace". Churches can bear with those that are Evil. They are not careful to <HI>purge out the old Leaven</HI>; and to make a Separation between the <HI>Precious and the Vile, the Clean and Unclean.</HI> Per∣sons don't in brotherly Love, watch over one ano∣thers Souls faithfully, and as they ought to do. That in Lev. xix.17. <HI>Thou shalt not hate thy Bro∣ther
<PB N="14" REF="004153_0017_1003D7615FFA9988"/>
in thine Heart: Thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy Neighbour, and not suffer Sin upon him</HI>; has not it's due Influence upon them. They are not careful to attend Christ's Rule and Expedient laid down in <HI>Matth.</HI> xviii. for the healing and removing pri∣vate Offences. They too often vent their own Pride and Passions, and serve their own Humours; instead of dealing with their offending Brother, in a humble, meek, compassionate and tender Way for his Recovery.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>A professing People are sometimes guilty of Dege∣neracy, in Respect of Life and Conversation.</HI> Practi∣cal Religion runs low among them, they grow very corrupt in their Morals. Temptations to Sin are multiplied, and Men give way to 'em, and are overcome by 'em, and evil Practices prevail a∣mong them. <HI>The Love of many waxes cold,</HI> and Sin and Iniquity abounds. Pride, Contempt of, and Disobedience to Superiours, Contention, Idleness, Intemperance, Uncleanness, inordinate Passions, sinful Heats and Hatreds, Backbitings, Tale-bear∣ing, Want of Truth, Promise-breaking, inordinate Affection to the World, Injustice, Oppression, and Strait-handedness as to publick Concerns. Their Carriage is not as becomes the Gospel. Their Be∣haviour does not adorn, but brings a Reproach up∣on the Profession, which they make, Isai. i.4. <HI>Ab sinful Nation, a People laden with Iniquity, a Seed of Evil-doers, Children that are Corrupters, they have forsaken the Lord, they have provoked the holy one of Israel unto Anger, they are gone backward.</HI></P>
<P>Thus Churches, or a professing People, many times become guilty of Declensions and Apostacies. I come now to say,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="15" REF="004153_0018_1003D77B759CDA80"/>2. <HI>That when Churches are thus guilty, it is their great Duty to remember from whence they are fallen, and repent, and do their first Works.</HI></P>
<P>And here,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They should remember from whence they are fal∣len.</HI> That is, in what Degree their Purity &amp; Pie∣ty was formerly, and compare it with what it is now. This will help them to a clearer Discovery of their sad Declensions and Decays; and may be serviceable to forward their Repentance. So the Lord's People of old, comparing the Glory of the first Temple with that of the latter, and finding this as nothing to that, they wept with a loud Voice. Compare <HI>Hagai</HI> ii.3. with <HI>Ezra</HI> iii.12.</P>
<P>But,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>They must repent of their Sins, by which they have apostatized from God.</HI></P>
<P>Here I will briefly consider the Nature of this great Duty, to which declining Churches are strong∣ly obliged. Now Repentance includes in it,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>A thorough Conviction of the Evil that there is in Sin against God.</HI></P>
<P>Sin is contrary to the holy Law, Nature &amp; Glo∣ry of God. By sinning Men make void God's Law, cast off his Government, trample upon his Sovereignty, despise his Wisdom, Goodness, Ho∣liness, and Omniscience. When Men sin, they slight the Promises of God, by which he would al∣lure them to Obedience; and set at nought his terrible Power and Justice, as if they might sin and yet secure themselves from his Indignation. By Sin God's glorious Attributes are denied or con∣temned, and he is greatly wronged. And it was
<PB N="16" REF="004153_0019_1003D7B070D51170"/>
this, that pierced and wounded our Saviour, yea, broke his Heart and fetch'd from him that bitter Exclamation when upon the Cross, <HI>My God! My God! Why hast thou forsaken me?</HI> Moreover, it's what grieves the kind and good Spirit, <HI>Eph.</HI> iv.30. Now a Sight and Sense of the Evil of Sin in these Respects, is firstly implied in Repentance. Where∣as many are so foolish, as to <HI>make a Mock at Sin,</HI> to think slightly about it; the true Penitent has quite other Thoughts of it, and beholds it, as ex∣ceeding sinful.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>True Repentance includes in it, godly Sorrow for Sin. 2 Cor.</HI> vii.10. Some have grieved for Sin, and yet have had nothing of this godly Sorrow for Sin. Their Grief proceeds from the Apprehension of the Wrath and Curse of God which pursues them, and is ready to seize on them. This is a legal Sorrow, a grieving for Sin as against a Man's self; because it has betrayed him to Death and Damnation. In this Sense, Hypocrites, yea, Reprobates may sor∣row and mourn for Sin. <HI>Judas</HI> repented himself, saying, <HI>I have sinned, in that I have betrayed the in∣nocent Blood,— and went and hanged himself,</HI> Mat. xxvii.3, 4, 5. But godly Sorrow is a saving Grace of the Spirit, and has Sin as a Wrong to God for the Object of it. So the <HI>penitent Prodigal,</HI> when his Heart was truly broken within him, he came to his Father, and says, <HI>I have sinned against Heaven, and in thy Sight,</HI> Luke xv.21. 'Twas the Wrong that he had done to the God of Heaven, that trou∣bled him. And this was that which sat so heavy upon <HI>David</HI>'s mournful Soul, Psalm li.4. <HI>Against thee, thee only have I sinned, and done this Evil in thy Sight.</HI></P>
<P>Again, Godly Sorrow is a mourning for Sin, as it has wounded our Saviour, Zech. xii.10. <HI>I will
<PB N="17" REF="004153_0020_1003D7C6349D5C40"/>
pour upon the House of David, and upon the Inhabi∣tants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of Grace and Supplica∣tion, and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one that mourneth for his only Son, and shall be in Bitterness for him, as one that is in Bitterness for his First-born.</HI> The true Penitent, realizing the Death and Suffer∣ings of his Saviour, and considering that it was his Sins, that were the procuring, meritorious Cause of them; therefore does he lament and bewail them.</P>
<P>Once more, The true Penitent grieves for his Sins, because thereby he has grieved the Spirit of God. The serious Consideration of the Benefits which he has received from this kind and good Spirit, and of his unworthy &amp; disingenuous Carri∣age towards him, opens the Springs of his Sorrow, and melts his Heart into the Current of evangeli∣cal Mourning for Sin.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Another Thing included in Repentance, is an Hatred of Sin.</HI> Natural Men love their Sins, and roul them as a sweet Morsel under their Tongues: They are as dear to them, as their right Hands, or right Eyes. But in Repentance, this Love is turned into Hatred. Hence says <HI>David,</HI> Psalm cxix.104. <HI>I hate every false Way.</HI> The true Peni∣tent hates the Name, and abhors the Nature of Sin. Yea, he loaths himself upon the Account of it. Job xlii.6. <HI>I abhor my self, and repent in Dust and Ashes.</HI> Ezek. xxxvi.3I. <HI>Then shall ye remember your own evil Ways, and your Doings that were not good, and shall loath your selves in your own Sight, for your Iniquities, and for your Abominations.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Another Thing included in Repentance, is Shame for Sin.</HI> Sin is a most shameful Thing, whether
<PB N="18" REF="004153_0021_1003D62AA1ACC5F8"/>
we consider it in Relation to our selves, or in Res∣pect to God, against whom, and in whose sight it is committed. And yet such is the Blindness of Men's Minds by Nature, that they glory in it. <HI>Phil.</HI> iii.19. But the true Penitent sees the Base∣ness of the Thing; and the Disgrace and Disho∣nour, Infamy and Reproach that he has brought upon himself thereby; and is covered with Con∣fusion at the Thoughts of it. Thus <HI>Ezra</HI> testified his Repentance, Chap. ix.6. <HI>O my God, I am a∣shamed, and blush to lift up my Face to thee, my God: For our Iniquities are increased over our Heads, and our Trespass is grown up unto the Heavens.</HI> And so the <HI>Publican,</HI> Luke xviii.13. <HI>Who standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his Eyes to Heaven, but smote upon his Breast, saying, God be merciful to me a Sinner.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>True Repentance is attended with a free and hearty Confession of Sin.</HI> Thus practised <HI>David,</HI> Psalm xxxviii.18. <HI>For I will declare mine Iniquity, I will be sorry for my Sin.</HI> So Psalm li.3. <HI>For I ac∣knowlege my Transgression, and my Sin is ever before me.</HI> He that will not so much as confess his Sins to God, and own that it would be a righteous Thing with him to inflict upon him the Punish∣ment which he deserves; can never be thought to repent of them, or share in his Mercy. <HI>He that covereth his Sins, shall not prosper: but whoso confes∣seth and forsaketh them, shall find Mercy.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. and finally, <HI>That Repentance which the Gospel calls for, includes in it a turning from, and forsaking of Sin.</HI> 1 Kings viii.35. <HI>If they turn from their Sin,—forgive the Sin of thy Servants.</HI> And where there is unfeigned and thorough Repentance, there is a turning not only from some, but all Sins; Ezek.
<PB N="19" REF="004153_0022_1003D7EF0FA17318"/>
xviii.30. <HI>Repent and turn your selves from all your Transgressions, so Iniquity shall not be your Ruin,</HI> One Sin allowed of, or indulged, is inconsistent with true Repentance. And this turning from Sin, must not be only for a Time, but for ever. Hos. xiv.8. <HI>Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with Idols?</HI></P>
<P>Thus I have described the Nature of that Re∣pentance, which Churches when backsliden from God, are called upon to practice.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>They must do their first Works.</HI> <Q>They must as it were begin again, go back step by step, till they come to the Place where they took the first false step</Q>.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Henry</HI> in loc.</NOTE> They must endea∣vour to recover their primitive Purity of <HI>Doctrine,</HI> of <HI>Worship,</HI> of <HI>Discipline,</HI> and <HI>Morals.</HI> They must revive their first Love to God and their Brethren, and regain their former Zeal for good Works. And this may suffice for the first Doctrine.</P>
<P>I proceed now to the second Doctrine, viz.</P>
<P>DOCT. II. <HI>That if declining Churches thus do, the Lord Jesus will graciously continue their Church-State unto them.</HI></P>
<P>Their Candlestick then shall not be removed out of it's Place, nor will the Lord remove his Gospel-Ministers and Ordinances from them. It may be said of Churches, as it is said of a Nation or King∣dom, in Jer. xviii.7, 8. <HI>At what Instant the Lord speaks concerning them, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy them</HI>; <HI>if</HI> such Churches <HI>against whom
<PB N="20" REF="004153_0023_1003D8079962BFB0"/>
he hath pronounced turn from their Evil, he will re∣pent of the Evil, that he thought to do unto them.</HI> When backsliding Churches return to God, he will return to them. Mal. iii.7. <HI>Even from the Days of your Fathers, ye are gone away from mine Ordinances, and have not kept them: return unto me, and I will return unto you.</HI> The Lord will assuredly, be with his professing People, while they are with him. 2 Chron. xv.2. <HI>Hear ye me Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin, the Lord is with you, while ye be with him.</HI> And if all manner of Blessings are enwrapped in this blessed Presence of God; then surely a Peo∣ple's sacred <HI>Immunities</HI> and <HI>Privileges.</HI></P>
<P>While Churches continue golden Candlesticks, the Lord Jesus will be in the midst of them, Rev. 5.i.13. And he will make it manifest that he is so, by the Protection and Defence vouchsafed to them. Isai. xxvii.2, 3. <HI>In that Day sing ye unto her, a Vine∣yard of red Wine. I the Lord do keep it, — least any hurt it, I will keep it Night and Day.</HI> Churches that are a Vineyard of red Wine, yielding the best and choicest Grapes; such Churches are, and shall always be, under the Wing of Christ's Protection. I the Lord that can do every thing, but cannot lie nor deceive, I do keep it; least any hurt it. These Vineyards lie much exposed to Injury; there are many that would hurt them, tread them down, and lay them waste: But God their Saviour will suffer no real Hurt or Damage to be done 'em, but what he will bring good out of. He will keep them constantly Night and Day, and not without Need; for their Enemies are restless, and unwearied in their Attempts and Designs against them; and both Night and Day seek an Oppor∣tunity to do them a Mischief.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="004153_0024_1003D81E03A17180"/>While Churches continue Vineyards of red Wine, bringing forth Fruit to God; he will not suffer persecuting Enemies to scatter them; nor Seducers and false Teachers to mislead them. In a Word, The Gates of Hell, the Power and Poli∣cy of Satan, and all his Agents and Instruments, shall not prevail against them.</P>
<P>Moreover, Christ will vouchsafe the Tokens of his Presence with such Churches, in watering, as well as in defending them; <HI>I will water it every Moment.</HI> He will supply them with all necessary Provisions; with his Ordinances, and the gracious Influences of his Holy Spirit. The still and silent Dews of God's Grace and Blessing, shall continu∣ally descend upon them, that they may bring forth much Fruit.</P>
<P>I come now to the third Doctrine.</P>
<P>DOCT. III. <HI>That unless apostatizing Churches do repent, they will provoke the Lord to unchurch them, and destroy them.</HI></P>
<P>It's true, the <HI>catholick Church</HI> cannot be lost. There is a Promise concerning the Church in ge∣neral, that it shall never fail. It is built upon a Rock, and let the Gate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Hell do their worst, it shall stand, <HI>Matth.</HI> xvi.I8. Christ ever had, and ever will have a Church on Earth. We read con∣cerning that City of God, that <HI>she shall not be mo∣ved.</HI> And that <HI>the highest himself shall establish her.</HI> And concerning this Mount Zion, that it <HI>abideth for ever.</HI></P>
<P>But then a <HI>particular Church</HI> may fail, and there is not one particular Church, but what is liable to an utter Extirpation. Churches for their Sins and
<PB N="22" REF="004153_0025_1003D83ACB9944D0"/>
Defections may be unchurched, and Candlesticks removed.</P>
<P>Many sad and deplorable Instances of this Nature may be produced.</P>
<P>So the golden Candlestick of the <HI>jewish Church,</HI> was removed. They <HI>were broken off, because of Un∣belief.</HI> The Jews had the offer of Christ made un∣to them; yea, the first Offer, but they rejected it, and hereupon God rejected them, and the King∣dom of God was taken from them, and in this woful Condition, do they remain to this Day.</P>
<P>Upon the Rejection of the <HI>Jews,</HI> the <HI>Gentiles</HI> were called in, and many Churches gathered out of them. And many of these Churches, for their grievous Neglects and Contempts of the Covenant of God, have been dischurched by him.</P>
<P>What <HI>Ephesus</HI> was threatned with in our Text, is fulfilled upon that, and the other six Churches of the lesser <HI>Asia.</HI> The Candlesticks are removed out of their Places.</P>
<P>Those once famous Churches that had a graci∣ous and glorious Presence of the Lord Jesus Christ in them, for <HI>he walked in the midst of those golden Candlesticks</HI>; I say, these Churches have sinned a∣way the Gospel, and the Glory of a pure Church-State is taken from them. The Christian Name, which yet they wear, is in a Manner all of Chris∣tianity that is left among them. They are woful∣ly overwhelmed with Ignorance, Errors, Heresies, Superstitions and Idolatry; and are now groaning under the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Oppressions.</P>
<P>In other Parts of <HI>Asia,</HI> where the Gospel has been preached, and Churches planted in the Days of the <HI>Apostles,</HI> they have lost the christian Religi∣on. Yea, the christian Name among some of 'em, is not now to be found. Thus Darkness covers
<PB N="23" REF="004153_0026_1003D85195416418"/>
that Part of the Earth, and gross Darkness the People.</P>
<P>And now let us go into some other Quarters of the World, as the Jews were ordered to <HI>Shiloh</HI>; and see what an angry God has done there, for the Wickedness of his People.</P>
<P>Time was, when there were thousands of glori∣ous Churches in <HI>Africa,</HI> and many bright and shi∣ning Stars; among whom, Austin the renowned Bishop of Hippo, must be accounted one of the first Magnitude; but now, the Shadow of Death stretches it self over those once happy Regions of Light, and not a Church or Minister to be seen there.</P>
<P>Look we now into <HI>Europe,</HI> and here in <HI>Rome</HI> it self, there was a Church <HI>beloved of God, called to be Saints, whose Faith was spoken of throughout the whole World,</HI> Rom i.7. But her Name is now, <HI>THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS, AND ABO∣MINATIONS OF THE EARTH,</HI> Rev. xvii.5. Since the glorious <HI>Reformation</HI> begun in these latter Ages of the World, there have been famous Churches in the Kingdom of <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Transylvania</HI>; but <HI>Socinianism</HI> made a Gap for <HI>Popery,</HI> and by these they were ruined. To pass by the Desolati∣ons that have come upon the numerous christian Churches that have been in <HI>Bohemia, Hungaria,</HI> and in the Valleys of <HI>Piemont</HI>; let us come to <HI>France.</HI> <Q>The Time was, (as we are informed <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vid. Judge <HI>Dudley</HI>'s Introduction to his Essay on the <HI>Mer∣chandize of Slaves and Souls of M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.</HI> Page 2.</NOTE>) when the reformed could there count two thousand one hundred and fifty Churches; in most of these two Ministers, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me five;
<PB N="24" REF="004153_0027_1003D86719B6EA90"/>
the Church of <HI>Orleans</HI> had seven thousand Com∣municants; but their Bodies now lie dead in the Street of the great City, &amp;c. <HI>Rev.</HI> xi.7, 8. In the Year 1686, not a single Church left, or a reformed Minister, to be seen in all that King∣dom.</Q> A Divine of great Judgment and emi∣nent Piety, observes, <Q>That the Error of Justifi∣cation by Works brings Judgments from God upon a People, that give it any Countenance, and forsake the Truth. This (says he) is ve∣rified in the <HI>French</HI> Churches; they receded from the first Reformers in the Doctrine of Jus∣tification; this is what the most guilty of 'em will deny, but it was so evident, that the <HI>Papist</HI> took Notice of it.—The <HI>French Protestants</HI> did not zealously stick to the Doctrine of Justi∣fication by Faith in the Righteousness of Christ, as it was transmitted and conveyed down to them, by our Reformers; and what followed? A Decay of Piety, and a Corruption of Man∣ners, which provoked God to scatter and cast them off <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See Mr. <HI>Richard Taylor</HI>'s Scripture Doctrine of Justification.</NOTE></Q>.</P>
<P>Thus we see how it has fared with some other Churches. Now, like Errors and Sins, if persisted in, and not repented of, will procure like confound∣ing and unchurching Dispensations towards other Churches, that yet thro' Grace enjoy their Church-State.</P>
<P>Having thus finished the Doctrines laid down, I now proceed to the</P>
<P>APPLICATION.</P>
<P>USE, I. <HI>Is it as we have heard, that Churches have many Times been guilty of great Apostacies from
<PB N="25" REF="004153_0028_1003D880AB963018"/>
God?</HI> Hence the <HI>Churches</HI> and <HI>professing People</HI> of this Land, would do well from the Consideration of this sad Truth, to look into the State of Religi∣on among themselves, and strictly to examine whe∣ther they are not in a declining Condition. These Churches, that have been famous for their <HI>Doc∣trine, Worship, Discipline</HI> and <HI>Manners,</HI> are they yet so? Or have we not by Degrees, turned into the degenerate Plant of a strange Vine unto God? Have we not lost much of our first Love, and of our primitive Purity, Piety and holy Strictness? If we compare our selves with our pious <HI>Ancestors,</HI> shall we not find ourselves as much sunk below them, in point of true Worth and Excellency, as <HI>Re∣boboam</HI>'s brasen Shields were below <HI>Solomon</HI>'s gol∣den ones? Are we not departing from <HI>the Faith once delivered to the Saints</HI>; and which was once closely embraced, and highly prized, by these Churches? And is not <HI>Ignorance</HI> of God, and the Things of God, with <HI>Errors,</HI> the <HI>Arminian</HI> especially, apace coming in among us? What a holy Heat, what a flaming Love, was found in the Hearts of the pri∣mitive Christians of this Land, to the House and Ordinances of God? And how careful and diligent were they, in attending the publick Assemblies of God's People, on Lecture Days, as well as on the Lord's Days? But alas! Is not the Love of many in this Regard waxen cold? And is it not the Manner of many, to neglect the assembling of themselves together? How strict were they in keep∣ing of Sabbaths, not speaking their own Words? But is not the Rest of the Sabbath now sadly disturb∣ed? Don't many take a mighty Liberty in their Discourse on the Lord's Day? Don't they discourse almost of any thing that they discourse of on other Days? How careful were our dear Progenitors to offer up the morning and evening Sacrifice in their
<PB N="26" REF="004153_0029_1003B69A8C4670D8"/>
Families, and of Reading the holy Scriptures to 'em, and instructing them from orthodox Catechisms? But is not Family-Worship and Instruction fallen under great Decays among us, their degenerate Off∣spring? And if we are so defective as to publick and private Worship, can we rationally think that secret Worship is better attended? The first Plan∣ters of this Land, and Members of these Churches, were Men eminent for vital, practical Religion: 'Twas God in his Ordinances, that they thirsted and panted after: The Power of Godliness then went with the Form of it. But is not our Religion, in a great degree degenerated into Rituality? Is it not in a great Measure external, void of Life, Spirit and Power? <HI>Joshua</HI>'s Resolution was the Resolution of our pious Ancestors, <HI>As for me and my House, we will serve the Lord.</HI> Great was their Care to main∣tain a wise and good Government over their Chil∣dren and Servants: 'Twas their study, that their Families might be well ordered Families. But is not Family-Government now almost lost &amp; gone? Time was when Discipline in these Churches, was upheld in the Power of it; and upon this account, they were <HI>beautiful as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an Army with Banners.</HI> But alas! How is it fallen now, and how remiss are we grown? The Lives and Morals of our Fathers were such, as became the Gospel. They were a humble, loving, peaceable, industrious, chast, temperate, sober Peo∣ple; greatly mortified to the World, willing that their Neighbours should thrive, as well as themselves, true in their Words, faithful in their Promises, punctual in their Performances, honest &amp; just in their Dealings &amp;c. One <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Firmin.</NOTE> that liv'd in this Country, in the beginning
<PB N="27" REF="004153_0030_1003D89D66B66E50"/>of our Times, for seven Years together, was able in the hearing of as an <HI>august Assembly</HI> as perhaps has been known in the World,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The House of Lords and Commons, with the Assembly of Divines at <HI>Westminster.</HI></NOTE> to give this Testi∣mony of them, <Q>That he never saw a Beggar, nor a Man overcome with strong Drink, nor did he ever hear a profane Oath among them</Q>. But don't immoral Practices greatly abound among us? and are they not a grievous blot and stain to our Profession?</P>
<P>Thus by inquiring into the State of Religion a∣mong us now, and comparing it with what it has been, we learn our own woful Defections; and what reason we have to say with the lamenting Church, Lam. iv.1. <HI>How is the Gold become Dim! How is the most fine Gold changed!</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Let us now be Exhorted to repent, and do our first Works.</P>
<P>And here,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Let us sincerely repent of our Declensions and Apostacies from God.</HI> From a deep Sense, how in∣jurious our Sins have been to a glorious God, and the great Dishonour they have done to his sacred Name; let us bitterly lament them. And have our Miscarriages wounded the Soul of our Saviour, and broke his Heart? O let the Thoughts hereof, wound and break our Souls within us. And let us grieve at the Heart, for our Sins and Backslidings; because thereby we have grieved the Holy Spirit of God. Let us confess our Sins to God, with all the aggravating Circumstances of them; as being committed against so much Light, Love, Means, Professions, Confessions and Covenant-Engagemens:
<PB N="28" REF="004153_0031_1003D8A53A23A6D8"/>
and let us take the Shame and Blame of them to our selves. Let us <HI>lie down in our Shame, and Con∣fusion let it cover us; because we have sinned against the Lord.</HI> Let us remember <HI>our evil Ways and Do∣ings, which have not been good; and loath our selves in our own Sight for our Iniquities, and our Abominati∣ons.</HI> And let us <HI>cease to do evil, and learn to do well.</HI></P>
<P>But this brings me to the second Particular,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Let us do our first Works.</HI> And here,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Let us acquaint our selves with the Christian Doctrines, and be established therein.</HI> We should with diligence and faithfulness improve the Ad∣vantages we have, to grow up to some Maturity herein. Let us have our Senses exercised, to dis∣cern both Truth and Error, reaching on to the Measure of the Stature of the Fulness of Christ, in Knowlege. Especially, let us labour for a clear, thorough Acquaintance with the more momentous and important Truths of the Gospel. And let us be well grounded in these, and not let them slip. Every Truth is to be preserved, but especially the more weighty and necessary. And we had need give the more earnest heed, because our Lot is fallen in a Day of abounding Errors, when the precious Doctrines, wherein are the vitals of Chris∣tianity, are denied, yea, ridicul'd and derided.</P>
<P>A very worthy <HI>Divine</HI> of the <HI>English Nation,</HI> in the Account which he gives of the State of Reli∣gion, among English Protestant Dissenters; tells us, <Q>That as to the Doctrines contained in the Scrip∣ture, they are almost struck out of the List of Articles of Faith. Error may truly be said to come in like a Flood, and to spread itself like a raging Torrent; we may cry out, The Floods have lifted up their Waves. Most of the per∣nicious
<PB N="29" REF="004153_0032_1003B69EB6B3FB88"/>
Errors which have formerly been bro't into the Church, are eagerly embraced in our unhappy Times; the Enemies have for some Years, been endeavouring to rob Christ and the Holy Spirit of the glory of their supreme Divi∣nity, and to reduce them to the rank of Crea∣tures; and now Men grow bolder in Error, they are forward to deny their Personality, and to make them only Attributes, Powers, and Names of the Father. God's Election of his People to Glory, is arraigned as unreasonable, and his So∣vereignty is, in the most saucy Manner opposed: The Fall of Man is intirely forgot, and his ori∣ginal Corruption is eagerly denied: The Satis∣faction of Christ is blasphemed and exploded, and his Death is said to be what must, accord∣ing to the necessity of Nature, have fallen out: Justification by his Righteousness, is a Point pur∣sued with Rancour and Malice; and Sincerity, tho' in an Error, is given out to be a sufficient Title to God's Favour: Preaching Christ in his Person, Offices, and in the Merit of his Death, undergoes the Persecution of cruel Mockings, and is spoken of by brain-sick Novices only with a Snear: The efficacious Grace of the Holy Spi∣rit, and his sanctifying and comforting Influen∣ces, are rudely blasphemed as Enthusiasm; and the Power of Man to convert himself, and to answer all the Ends of his living in the World, is eagerly contended for: — The Perseverance of the Saints in Holiness, is profanely bantered: The stupid and brutish Notion of the Soul's sleep∣ing after Death, is by some hotly maintained, and its Immateriality &amp; Immortality exploded by o∣thers. The Resurrection of the same Body, is re∣presented as impossible; and a general Judgment, nay, a particular Time of Men's appearing be∣fore
<PB N="30" REF="004153_0033_1003D8B639E993A8"/>
God to give an Account of what they have done in the Body, is now a Subject of ridicule; and the Doctrine of the Wicked being reserved for eternal Torments, is, by many, set by</Q>. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the Defence of some important Doctrines of the Gospel, in Twenty six Sermons; most of which were preach'd in <HI>Lime Street</HI> by several Ministers, in two Volumes. Parti∣cularly, Mr. <HI>Abraham Taylor's</HI> Sermon on <HI>Rev.</HI> iii 1, 2, 3. Intitled, <HI>A humble and impartial Inquiry into the Causes of the Decay of practical Religion.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>And is this the doleful State of Religion, as to Matters of Belief among Protestant Dissenters at Home? Then let us look to it, that it be not our Condition here. The same <HI>reverend Person</HI> tells us, that Matters are not better with them with respect to Practice, than they are with respect to Faith. And if we with them, let go the Principles of Re∣ligion, with them also, shall we forego the Practice of it. If we grow as corrupt in our Doctrines as they; we shall grow as corrupt in our Lives and Conversations. If we make Shipwreck of Faith, so we shall of a good Conscience. Let us then, be up∣on our Guard: Let us heedfully watch against all Temptations of one kind and of another, to draw us off from the Truth.</P>
<P>And let us especially see to this, that our Know∣lege of divine Truths, be spiritual and saving. A literal and doctrinal Knowlege of divine Truths, is no Security against Apostacy from them. He that only has the Truths of the Gospel floating on the surface of his Brains, may hold 'em to Day, and renounce them toMorrow. But a saving Know∣lege of Gospel-Truths, is a good security against Temptations, opposition or seduction from the Truth. Prov. xxiv.5. <HI>A wise Man is strong, yea, a Man of Knowledge increaseth Strength.</HI> When Men come to see the Truths of the Gospel, in their spiritual Na∣ture and Glory; when they are convinced of the
<PB N="31" REF="004153_0034_1003D8BCAFC33FC8"/>
Truth of them, and experience the Power and Efficacy of them upon their own Souls; they will not easily and readily let them go. "No Man (as a great Divine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Owen.</HI></NOTE> well expresses it) who forsakes the Truth, ever saw the Glory of it, or had expe∣rience of it's Power."</P>
<P N="2">2. As to the <HI>Worship of God.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>Let it be our great concern to preserve and maintain it, in it's Purity.</HI> Let us look upon the Word of God, as a perfect Rule of Worship, as well as of Faith; and keep severely to it, in this matter. Admitting nothing, that is contradicted by it, nor detracting any Thing, that is prescribed therein. Man may vainly think, to make God's Ordinances better, by some Additions &amp; Inventions of his own: But let us believe, that's it's better for us, to enjoy them in their native Purity, Simplicity, and Spiri∣tuality. A pompous ceremonial Worship it's true, is more apt to work upon, and affect the Senses; but a pure, spiritual and divine Worship, such as Gospel Worship is, is more adapted to reach the Soul. And then due Care should be taken by these Churches, that there Members be, as the Members of the first Churches of the Gospel were, even, <HI>Saints, faithful Brethren, &amp; sanctified in Christ Jesus.</HI> <Q>Such as are found and knowing in all the funda∣mental Doctrines of the christian Religion, with∣out Scandal in their Lives, and to a Judgment regulated by the Word of God, are Persons of visible Godliness &amp; Honesty, credibly professing cordial Subjection to Christ.</Q> Since God is jea∣lous of his Worship, so let us be.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) Let us duly attend the Worship of God.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="004153_0035_1003D797AB7B5130"/><HI>Secret Prayer,</HI> Let it be daily addressed to the glo∣rious Hearer of Prayer. This is a Duty which our Lord recommends unto us by his own Example, as well as strictly requires of us. Morning and Even∣ing did he engage in it. Let us imitate our blessed Saviour herein, and make a practice of secret Prayer to God Morning and Evening, as long as we live. With what Face can we call our selves Christians, if we neglect it?</P>
<P><HI>Family-Worship,</HI> Let that also be duly perform'd. Families are furnished with many special Advanta∣ges and Opportunities for God's solemn Worship, which are so many Talents, that they ought to im∣prove for God, and in the worshipping of him. God is the Founder and Institutor of our Families: and since they are of him, and thro' him, they ought to be to him. Our Families are the Lord's, for he made them; therefore should they be for his Use, imployed in his Service, to his Honour.</P>
<P>And here, <HI>Let us pray to God in our Families.</HI> Heads of Families should pray with them and for them. We are bidden to <HI>pray with all Prayer,</HI> Eph. 6.18. with Family-Prayer, as well as secret and publick. We are taught it, by the Example of holy Man in Scripture. <HI>Abraham</HI> with his Houshold called on the Name of the Lord. Where-ever he pitched his Tent, there he built an Altar to the Lord. <HI>Gen.</HI> xii.8, — xiii.4, 18. <HI>Joshua</HI> said, <HI>As for me and my House, we will serve the Lord.</HI> Prayer is so necessary a part of God's Service, that a Per∣son can't be said in general to be devoted to God's Service without it. And of <HI>Cornelius</HI> it is said, <HI>Act.</HI> x.2. That <HI>he feared God with all his House—and pray∣ed alway.</HI> He worshipped God with all his House, and maintained a constant course of Prayer with them. The Jews were won't to Sacrifice to God, every Morning and Evening, <HI>Numb.</HI> xxviii.3, 4.
<PB N="33" REF="004153_0036_1003D8C6A87DE7E0"/>
Christians that by Profession are a Royal Priesthood, should offer the Sacrifice of Family Prayer &amp; Praise, every Morning and Evening. When the Apostle says to Masters of Families, Col. 4.2. <HI>Continue in Prayer</HI>; it's probable (says One) he alludes to the continual Burnt-Offering, that was offered Morning and Evening. O how reasonable, how becoming is it, for Families in the Morning, to bless God for the Mercies of the Night past, and to ask his need∣ful Favours for the ensuing Day. And so in the Evening, to bless God for the Mercies of the Day past, and to ask his Protection &amp; Favour to them, in the ensuing Night. And what Reason have those Families, that neglect calling upon God, to fear, that he will <HI>pour out his Fury on them?</HI></P>
<P>Further, We should teach our Families <HI>the good Knowlege of the Lord.</HI> Deut. xi.18, 19, 20. <HI>There∣fore shall ye lay up these my Words in your Heart, and in your Soul; and bind them for a Sign upon your Hand, that they may be as Frontlets between your Eyes. And ye shall teach them your Children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine House, and when thou walk∣est by the Way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. And thou shalt write them upon the Door∣Posts of thine House, and upon thy Gates.</HI> Eph. vi.4. <HI>And ye Fathers, bring up your Children in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord.</HI> Parents &amp; Heads of Fa∣milies, should read the Scriptures to their Families, in a serious and solemn Manner. And they should Catechise their Children and Servants, obliging them to learn their Catechism by Heart, and to keep it in remembrance: And should endeavour to help them to understand it, as they become capable. Both Parents would do well to engage in a dili∣gent Instructing their Children. <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Father was his Tutor, <HI>Prov.</HI> iv.3, 4. And he never forgot the Lessons, his Mother taught him, <HI>Prov.</HI> xxxi.1.
<PB N="34" REF="004153_0037_1003D8CCDD8EECD0"/>
Yet again, we that are Parents, should not content our selves, with a bear teaching our Children, the great Truths of our holy Religion; but should la∣bour in it, that those Truths may be savingly im∣press'd upon their Hearts betimes. Wherefore we should solemnly command &amp; charge our Children to serve the Lord: Yea, seriously Expostulate with 'em about it. <HI>David</HI> charges his Son <HI>Solomon, Know thou the God of thy Father, &amp; serve him with a perfect Heart, and with a willing Mind.</HI> And his excellent Mo∣ther expostulates with him, Prov. xxxi.2, 3, 4, 5 <HI>What my Son? and what the Son of my Womb? and what the Son of my Vows</HI>? &amp;c.</P>
<P>Once more, <HI>Let the publick Worship be carefully attended by us.</HI> The Charge is, <HI>not to forsake the assembling of our selves together,</HI> Heb. x.28. Christ was zealous for the publick Worship of God, John ii.17. <HI>The Zeal of thine House hath eaten me up.</HI> As Christ was, so let us be, zealous for the publick Worship of God. It's what glorifies God most; it's what he accepts best. <HI>The Lord loveth the Gates of Zion, more than all the Dwellings of Jacob.</HI> Let us then give diligent Attendance at his House; Op∣portunities to hear the Word of God there, and to enjoy his Ordinances on our own Days, should be embraced by us; but especially should we frequent the Assemblies of God's People on the Lord's Days; and not suffer small Matters to keep us from them. And let us make Conscience of attending both the morning and evening Sacrifices of the Lord's Day; and not content our selves with coming to the pub∣lick Worship on one part of the Day, and staying away the other, as the Manner of too many is. And let us be advised <HI>to come seasonably.</HI> Many wrong their own Souls in not so doing. There is no Part of God's Worship, but it concerns every one, and every one may receive Benefit by it, if it be not their own Fault. And then they wrong the
<PB N="35" REF="004153_0038_1003D8D69C44C930"/>
Congregation. People's coming late, gives Occa∣sion of drawing away the Minds of others from the Worship of God, (as has been already observed) and so hinders their Profit and Advantage.</P>
<P>And now to shut up this Head,</P>
<P N="3">(3.) and lastly, <HI>Let us guard against Formality in the Worship of God, and approve our selves such Wor∣shipers, as he is seeking for, who worship him in Spi∣rit and in Truth.</HI> Let us not put off God with ex∣ternal Observances, and with bodily Reverence and Attendance; this we must give him; but we must principally regard, that our Service of him, be a spiritual Service. We must see to it, that all Acts of outward Worship to God, be performed with a pure and sincere Mind. Whatever we do in the Service of God, let us <HI>do it heartily as to the Lord,</HI> with Understanding, feeling and true Devotion of Soul.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Let us be careful to maintain and uphold Govern∣ment and Discipline.</HI></P>
<P>Particularly,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>In our Families.</HI> Every christian Family should be <HI>a Church in the House.</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> xvi.19. <HI>Col.</HI> iv.15. In which, as the Master should be a <HI>teaching Prophet,</HI> and (a sacrificing) <HI>praying Priest</HI>; so likewise a <HI>ruling King,</HI> keeping up Family-Government and Discipline therein. Heads of Families should <HI>rule well their own Houses,</HI> 1 Tim. iii.4. should main∣tain a wise Government over their Children and Servants; so carry it, that they may both love them and fear them. They should countenance and encourage every thing, that is good and laudable in their Children and Servants; and on the other hand, discountenance every thing that is Evil in them. We must use our Authority to prevent Sin, to suppress it, in our Families. We must restrain our Children from Sin, as much as is possible. The
<PB N="36" REF="004153_0039_1003D8DBA9DD21F0"/>
Neglect of this brought sore Judgments on <HI>Eli's</HI> House, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> iii.13. We must indeed be careful not to <HI>provoke our Children to Wrath, lest they be dis∣couraged</HI>; and as to our Servants, we must forbear Threatning; yet we must also with holy Zeal and Resolution, and the Meekness of Wisdom, keep good Order in our Families, and <HI>set no wicked Thing before our Eyes,</HI> but witness against it, reprove it, yea, if need be, correct for it, <HI>Prov.</HI> xiii.24 &amp; xxiii.13, 14.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Let us look to it, that the Government of Christ in his Church, be duly upheld and exercised among us.</HI> Christ the King of the Church, has in his governing Wisdom, appointed a sutable Government to be up∣held therein. This Government is spiritual, in Con∣tradistinction to that which is civil &amp; worldly. And as the one is absolutely necessary to the well-being of the State; so the other, is as absolutely necessa∣ry to the Well-being of the Church. Where Church-Discipline and Government is not supported and practised, Confusion and every evil Thing is like to follow. <HI>Know ye not that a little Leaven leaven∣eth the whole Lump? Purge out therefore the old Lea∣ven,</HI> 1 Cor. v.6, 7. <Q>When Apostacy prevailed in the asiatick Churches, there (we are told) was the original Wound. They did not brandish the Sword of Discipline, which is Christ's own Ex∣pedient, for the Preservation of Churches in Pu∣rity; yea, this was the fatal Neglect, which by Degrees prov'd ruinous to these once famous and glorious Churches. Some learned Men have observed, that the Neglect of Discipline in the Churches of <HI>Asia,</HI> brought in Corruption of Man∣ners, and the Corruption of Manners (through the just revenging Hand of God) was attend∣ed with Corruption of Doctrine; and these to∣gether provoked the Lord, to lay these Churches

most desolate <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Increase Mather's</HI> Call to the rising Geeneration. P. 51.</NOTE>.</Q> So it was with the once famous Churches of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> remissness in their Discipline prov'd their Ruin. Discipline is Christ's Ordinance, both for the Prevention of Apostacy in Churches, and to recover them when collapsed. Let us carefully heed this Matter. Let us then <HI>not hear with them that are Evil,</HI> Rev. ii.2. Let us <HI>look diligently, lest any Man fail of the Grace of God, lest any Root of Bitterness springing up, trouble us, and many be defiled,</HI> Heb. xii.15. Sin is of an infecti∣ous and contagious Nature; and if there be not a Separation made between the Clean and the Un∣clean, (I mean such as are visibly so) it will have a fatal Tendency. It is a celebrated Saying, and a true one; That Church-Discipline, is the Throne in which Christ reigns. Now we must keep Christ upon the Thorne, by keeping up the Power of Dis∣cipline, would we have a Reign of Righteousness and Holiness among us.</P>
<P N="4">4. We must live a Life of Holiness, and new Obe∣dience. <HI>We must</HI> follow Holiness. <HI>We must</HI> serve the Lord without Fear, in Holiness and Righteousness before him, all the Days of our Life. As he that hath called us is holy, so must we be holy in all Manner of Conversation. Whatsoever Things are true, whatsoever Things are honest, whatsoever Things are just, whatso∣ever Things are pure, whatsoever Things are lovely, whatsoever Things are of good Report; if there be any Vertue, and if there be any Praise, let us think on those Things. <HI>We must</HI> live as the Grace of God which bringeth Salvation teaches us; even soberly, righteously and godly, in this present World.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="004153_0041_1003D8E377F9B640"/>Particularly, We must live soberly <HI>with Respect to our selves.</HI> We must not <HI>think of our selves more highly than we ought to think, but must think soberly,</HI> and must be humble. We must <HI>not love the World, neither the Things of the World</HI>; but suppress all ex∣travagant Desires after the Profits, Pleasures and Honours of it. We must be meek, and we must be temperate; and <HI>walk honestly as in the Day, not in rioting and Drunkenness.</HI> We must be chaste, and keep our Body, as a Thing consecrated to God, from all Impurity. A Sobriety in Speech, in Be∣haviour, in Apparel, in Recreations; must be obser∣ved by us.</P>
<P>Again, We must <HI>live righteously, towards all Men</HI>; rendring to all their Dues; <HI>Tribute to whom Tribute is due; Custom to whom Custom, Fear to whom Fear, &amp; Honour to whom Honour is due</HI>; and we must <HI>owe no Man any Thing but Love</HI>; that is a Debt, which we should be continually paying, by all suitable Expressions of Affection and Tenderness, to all we have to do withal. We must abound in Love to all Men, and exercise Lovingkindness in the Earth towards all. We must be benign, kind, merciful, charitable, use∣ful, helpful unto all Men. And be ready to do our utmost to redress those Miseries, whether spiri∣tual or temporal, which our Fellow-Creatures, and Fellow-Christians may be labouring under. We must be just and righteous in our Dealings, Traffick and Commerce, with one another; governing our selves herein, by that Rule of universal Equity laid down by our Saviour; <HI>Whatsoever ye would that Men should do unto you, do ye even so to them,</HI> Mat. vii.12. We must <HI>speak the Truth to our Neighbour</HI>; for this is his Due. We must be faithful in our Promises, peaceable in the Societies to which we belong. And if at any Time we are injured, we must not maintain any Grudges against those that
<PB N="39" REF="004153_0042_1003D8E85EFCC128"/>
have wronged us; but readily forgive them, as God (we hope) for Christ's sake will forgive us. To conclude, we must faithfully fill up all our Places and Relations, in which the Wisdom and Goodness of God hath set us, with sutable prescribed Duty.</P>
<P>Lastly, We must <HI>live godly towards God.</HI> Our Regards to him, must run thro' all. 1 Cor. x.31. <HI>Whether ye Eat or Drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the Glory of God.</HI> Personal and relative Duties must be done in obedience to his Commands, with Aims at the pleasing, gratifying and glorifying of him; from Principles of holy Love and Fear of him. But there is an express and direct Duty also, that we owe to God, and which we should be care∣ful to pay him; our Choice should be of him, as the Portion of our Souls; our Minds should be up∣on him; our Desires fervent and affectionate after him; our Delight in him; and we must fear him, trust in him, and depend upon him: and worship him in and by those Ways and Means, which he hath appointed in his Word; but of these I have spoken under a former Head. Let me add here, we must be very careful to sanctify the Lord's Day, and keep it holy, not only by a strict Attendance on the publick Worship of God in his House; but also by a faithful discharge of private Duties in our own Houses. Such as Prayer, Reading, Mediation &amp;c. not doing our own Ways, not finding our own Pleasure, not speaking our own Words, on God's holy Day.</P>
<P>And now by way of Motive,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Let us call to mind the second Doctrine, and what was said under the same; and be thereby excited to our Duty.</HI> We there heard, that if declining Churches <HI>do remember from whence they are fallen, and repent, and do their first Works</HI>; that then the Lord Jesus
<PB N="40" REF="004153_0043_1003B70105CD2F08"/>
Christ will continue their Church-State to them, and will not take his Kingdom from them. And if we so do, he will deal thus graciously with us. If we return to him, he will assuredly return to us; pardon and accept us, establish and bless us. <HI>Zech.</HI> 1.3. The Lord will then create upon our Chur∣ches as it were <HI>a Cloud and Smoak by Day, and the shining of a flame of Fire by Night</HI>; and on all the <HI>Glory create a Defence.</HI> As Birds flying, so will the Lord of Hosts defend us, defending also he will de∣liver us, and passing over, he will preserve us. The Lord will be unto us a <HI>Wall of Fire round about, and will be the Glory in the midst of us.</HI> With joyful Souls may we now sing, as in Isai. xxvi.I. <HI>We have a strong City, Salvation will God appoint for Walls and Bulwarks.</HI> He will not suffer the Boar out of the Wood to waste his Vineyard, nor the Wild Beast of the Field to devour it; nor shall the Foxes, the little Foxes, be permitted to spoil the Vines.</P>
<P>He will shed down his benign Influences upon us; and we shall <HI>grow as the Vine,</HI> and our <HI>Beauty shall be as the Olive Tree.</HI> We shall <HI>cast forth our Roots as Lebanon, and spread abroad our Branches.</HI> The Lord now will be our <HI>Shepherd, and we shall not want.</HI> He will make us to <HI>lie down in green Pastures</HI>; he will <HI>lead us beside the still Waters. In this Moun∣tain, will the Lord of Hosts make unto us a Feast of fat Things, a Feast of Wines on the Lees, of fat Things full of Marrow, of Wines on the Lees well refined.</HI> He will abundantly bless the Provision of Zion, endue the Ministers of the Gospel with Righteousness, and render the Ordinances of the Sanctuary effectual, thro' a divine Power accompanying of them; to the Conversion of Sinners, and the Edification of Saints. We shall be filled with Light, Life, and Love; we shall enjoy a sweet Communion with Christ here; and at last, pass to a sweeter in the heavenly World,
<PB N="41" REF="004153_0044_1003D8EF15BF71A0"/>
even to an immediate, full, uninterrupted &amp; ever∣lasting Communion with Christ. <HI>The Lord will give us Grace and Glory, and no good Thing will be with∣hold from us, if we walk uprightly</HI> with him.</P>
<P>In recovering, and maintaining the Interest of Religion among us, we shall lay a Foundation for temporal, as well as spirital and eternal Blessings. Besides the natural tendency which our excellent Religion has to promote the outward Good and Prosperity of a People; it has a moral, federal ten∣dency to do it. See <HI>Deut.</HI> 28. from <HI>ver.</HI> 1, <HI>to</HI> 13. So <HI>Deut.</HI> 29.9. <HI>Keep therefore the Words of this Cove∣nant, and do them, that ye may prosper in all that ye do.</HI> Isah. 1.19. <HI>If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the Land.</HI> Hos. 2.21, 22. <HI>And it shall come to pass in that Day</HI> (the Day of God's be∣trothing his People unto himself) <HI>I will hear, saith the Lord, I will hear the Heavens, &amp; they shall hear the Earth, and the Earth shall hear the Corn, and the Wine, and the Oyl, and they shall hear Jezreel.</HI> To close this Head, if we will incline our Hearts unto the Lord our God, to walk in all his Ways, and to keep his Commandments, and his Statutes, and his Judg∣ments, which he commanded our Fathers; then he will be with us, as he was with our Fathers: nei∣ther will he leave us, nor forsake us. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. Let us consider, <HI>that unless we do repent of our Sins, and return to God and our Duty; we shall pro∣voke the Lord Jesus, the Head and King of the Church, to remove our Candlestick out of its Place.</HI> Thus has he dealt with other Churches, for their Sins and Apostacies from him, as was shown under the third Doctrine: And thus may we justly fear, he will deal with us, if like them, we persist in our Sins and Rebellions against him. Our increasing Declensions, will increase God's Anger against us, and we may justly expect that at last, they will end in unchurch∣ing

Dispensations. And Oh! How lamentable will our Case be, if it come to this! If the Gospel be one of the greatest Blessings, God can bless a Peop∣le withal; then the removal of it, must be ac∣counted one of the sorest Judgments that can befall them. Of the three sore Judgments of God, Fa∣mine, Sword and Pestilence; Famine seems to be the heaviest. <HI>David</HI> chose the Pestilence, before the Sword and Famine, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> xxiv.14. And the Prophet tells us, in Lam. iv.9, 10. <HI>They that be slain with the Sword, are better than they that be slain with Hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for want of the Fruits of the Field. The Hands of the pitiful Women have sodden their own Children, they were their Meat in the Destruction of the Daugh∣ter of my People.</HI> And yet a Famine of Bread, or a Thirst of Water, is not so terrible, as a Famine of Hearing the Word of the Lord. The one is bo∣dily, the other is spiritual; a Soul-Famine, and of all Evils, Soul-Evils are the worst. Bodily Famine can but kill the Body: But this spiritual Famine, holds the Sinner under spiritual Death, and will bring him under the Power of eternal Death. We are told, Prov. xxix.18. <HI>Where there is no Vision, the People perish.</HI> When the Gospel comes to be removed from a People, thick Darkness comes up∣on 'em; they sit in Darkness, and in the Shadow of Death. Such are Children of Darkness, and are in the Way that leads down to the Blackness of Darkness for ever. The Way to the inter∣nal Call, is by the external; and when this is not vouchsafed, it is a sad Evidence, that the other is denied. Rom. x.14. <HI>How shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a Preacher?</HI> As much as to say, they cannot. Where the Light of the Gospel shines not, there is no Illumination, Conversion, Edifica∣tion

or Salvation to be expected.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Knowledge of Christ is none of Nature's Principles: The Book of the Creatures is no Means alone, much less a sufficient Means to teach the Knowledge of Christ. It may discover Mercy, but gives not the least hint of the way of Mercy: It speaks nothing of God Incarnate; of the two Natures in one Person; of Jesus the Son of <HI>Mary</HI>; of Christ's Suretiship, and Suffering for us, rising, ascending, mediating, returning; of the two Covenants, and their several Condi∣tions, and the Rewards of keeping them, and Penalty of breaking them, &amp;c. It's utterly silent in these Things. And to affirm that the Spirit calls or teacheth Men where the Word is not, and where the Creature or Nature speaks not, is, I think, a groundless Fiction. <HI>Baxter's Saints Everlasting Rest.</HI> Page 128.</NOTE> How sad then must the State of such a People be!</P>
<P>In a Word, When the Gospel goes from a Peo∣ple, all outward Peace and Prosperity will go along with it. It never comes, but with a full Blessing; and it never departs, but it leaves a full Curse be∣hind it. 2 Chron. xv.3, 5, 6. <HI>Now for a long Season, Israel had been without the true God, and without a teaching Priest, &amp; without Law. And in those Times there was no Peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in: But great Vexations were upon all the Inha∣bitants of the Countrys. And Nation was destroyed of Nation, and City of City: for God did vex them with all Adversity.</HI> A universal Scourge, and all Manner of Troubles were disquieting of 'em. While the Gospel stays with a People, and is prized, and embraced, and obeyed by 'em; all will continue with them: But when this is gone, our other En∣joyments will not last. In a Word, A People in losing the Gospel, lose their God, and what a Loss is this! Hos. ix.12. <HI>Wo unto them, when I depart from them.</HI> And, wo, wo, wo, unto us if God, and the Gospel depart from us; we shall be in a most woful State, if it once come to this. Nothing
<PB N="44" REF="004153_0047_1003D8FBE53187B8"/>
can be expected then, but all Manner of Miseries, temporal spiritual and eternal, Jer. xxiii.33. <HI>When this People shall ask thee, saying, What is the Burden of the Lord? Thou shalt say unto them, What Bur∣den? I will even forsake you.</HI> Awful Burden indeed, that will sink us into a bottomless Abyss of Cala∣mities. Let us then seriously say these Things to Heart, and let us be perswaded, to reform those Things that are amiss among us, and do the first Works.</P>
<P>By Way of Direction,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Let us cry to God, for his Spirit and the Influ∣ences thereof, to enable us to comply with our Duty. Without me,</HI> says Christ, <HI>ye can do nothing,</HI> John xv.5. We shall never repent, unless the Lord Jesus, who is exalted at God's right hand, give Repen∣tance unto us. Nor shall we do our first Works, unless God by his Holy Spirit, work in us, both to Will and to do, of his own good Pleasure. If God by his Spirit, will revive us, and raise us up; we shall live in his Sight. If he will pour out his Spi∣rit from on high upon us, our Wilderness shall be∣come a fruitful Field; and there is nothing short of this will do it. Since then, there is such a Ne∣cessity of the almighty Power of the Spirit of God, to effect a real and thorough Work of Reformati∣on among us; let us earnestly seek to God by Prayer, to pour him out upon us for that End: Such Prayers are pleasing to God, since what is prayed for tends so directly to his Glory, and the good of Men's Souls; And they are a very nota∣ble Means to obtain the Holy Spirit from God. Luke xi.9. <HI>Ask, and it shall be given.</HI> What shall be given? Even, <HI>the Holy Spirit to them that ask him,</HI> Ver. 13. Well then, Let us knock hard at Heaven-Gates. Let us wrestle with God for so in∣valuable a Mercy, and take no Denial. Let us
<PB N="45" REF="004153_0048_1003D93E792F6B68"/>
cry mightily to Heaven, that he would return and leave a Blessing behind him. Let us beg with the Prophet <HI>Habakkuk,</HI> Chap iii.2. <HI>O Lord, revive thy Work in the midst of the Years, in the midst of the Years make known: in Wrath remember Mercy.</HI> Let us pray with <HI>Moses</HI> the Man of God, as in Psalm xc.16, 17. <HI>Let thy Work appear unto thy Servants; and thy Glory unto their Children. And let the Beau∣ty of the Lord our God be upon us, and establish thou the Work of our Hands upon us: yea; the Work of our Hands establish thou it.</HI> The Out-pouring of the Spirit of God for the reviving of Religion among us, is a Matter of the last Importance; and there∣fore should we pray for the same, with all Manner of Prayer, secret, private and publick; in Sinceri∣ty, Humility, Faith and Fervency.</P>
<P>Blessed be God, that there has been such a Spi∣rit of Prayer, for spiritual Blessings, awakened a∣mong his People of late Years. Let us continue herein, and not faint. And let us be encouraged to perseverance in Prayer, from what God has wrought in some Parts of this Land. I mean more especially, <HI>the County of Hampshire.</HI> His People there, have had a marvellous Visit from the Lord of Hosts, and the Man of his right hand.

bestowed upon them, and to be thankful for it; (if one Member be honoured, all the Mem∣bers rejoyce with it) so should we thereby be mo∣ved, earnestly to pray, that the Work may become more general and universal. Since God seems to be on the giving Hand, let us with Importunity ask of him, that the whole Land may partake of the like blessed Effusions of the Holy Spirit.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Let us be directed to use what Means and Me∣thods we can to promote Religion, and a Work of Re∣formation.</HI> It is true, nothing short of the Spirit of God, will effect a thorough Reformation; and therefore should we so earnestly &amp; incessantly seek him by Prayer. But if our endeavours in the se∣veral Places and Stations, which God hath set us in, are wanting; we have little Reason to expect that God will hear us. It is in the Use of Means, that God is wont to grant his efficacious Grace and Spirit. Wherefore then, let us lay out our selves to the utmost in pushing forward this blessed Work.</P>
<P>Private Christians should exhort one another daily, least they be hardened through the Deceit∣fulness of Sin. Such should edify one another in Love. They should quicken one another to Duty. When the Lord had prophesied, <HI>Isai.</HI> ii.2. that un∣der the Gospel all Nations should flow unto the House of the Lord, he adds, Ver. 3. <HI>And many Peo∣ple shall go &amp; say, Come ye, and let us go up to the Moun∣tain of the Lord, to the House of the God of Jacob.</HI> Such should be their Zeal, that they should not on∣ly go themselves; but perswade and press o∣thers, to go with them. So let Christians do now, call upon their Neighbours, and draw them to the Assemblies of religious Worship, when they are backward in giving their Attendance there. Let Christians urge and excite one another to Duty, in one Instance of it, and another. By good Counsel,

Reproof, Instruction, Example; let them build up one another in the most holy Faith.</P>
<P>But there are <HI>two</HI> Orders of Men that I would particularly address here, and beseech to do what in them lies, that dying, languishing Religion may be revived among us. They are our <HI>civil Rulers,</HI> and the <HI>Ministers of the Gospel.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Let me address our honourable civil Rulers,</HI> and with a becoming Humility intreat them, to make the Interest of Religion among us their chief Con∣cern. You are under the most solemn Bonds and Obligations thus to do. You are <HI>the Ministers of God for Good unto us,</HI> for this Good, even to promote Religion among us; and you are favoured with sin∣gular Advantages and Opportunities therefor; O see to it, that you improve them! Civil Rulers may do much to prevent Apostacy among a profes∣sing People. It is remark'd of <HI>Israel,</HI> Judges ii.7. <HI>That they served the Lord all the Days of Joshua.</HI> And they may do much too, in recovering them from their Apostacies. Yea, where do we read, either in sacred or ecclesiastical History, of any remarka∣ble, general Reformation amongst a People, without the Help and Assistance of the Magistracy? Would <HI>Judah</HI> of old have reformed, if those pious &amp; ex∣cellent Kings, <HI>Asa, Jehosaphat, Hezekiah</HI> and <HI>Josiah,</HI> had not bestowed their Care, Zeal and Pains in ef∣fecting their Reformation? Would <HI>Luther</HI> at <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> or <HI>Calvin</HI> at <HI>Geneva,</HI> been able to carry on the glorious Work of Reformation to that length, if others of the civil Order had not joined their Endeavours with theirs? Since then, (my Fathers) <HI>the Matter belongs to you,</HI> and under God, has so great a Dependance upon you; <HI>arise, and be of good Courage.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="004153_0051_1003D90913F4CB90"/>Various are the Ways and Means in, and by which, Civil Rulers may set forward the Work of Reformation among a People; according to the various Stations, which they hold in the Govern∣ment. Will you then be perswaded in the several Posts, which God, your King and Country, have placed you in, to be up and doing.</P>
<P>And here, I shall begin with those, who are es∣pecially concerned in the important Business of this Day, His Majesty's Council in being, together with the Representatives of this Province.</P>
<P><HI>Honourable Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>You have a special Opportunity before you to further the religious, as well as civil Interests of this People. May God direct and assist you aright to improve it. Let not so much as one of you, give up himself to the Conduct of others, to do what they would have you, without examining whether it be right or wrong. Use your own Light &amp; Rea∣son, which God has given you, in this weighty Affair. It is a mean Thing indeed, to serve only as Tools, for others to work by. Will you remem∣ber, Sirs, that your Suffrages are not your own. You may not give your Voices to these and those, as you please. Consider, when you are together, that God standeth in the Congregation of the Mighty; he judgeth among the Gods. And if any of you a∣buse your Power in chusing, which God by the Royal CHARTER has conferred upon you, you must account for it another Day. Let all crooked De∣signs and sinister Ends be now laid aside; and act in the Integrity of your Hearts, as in the Presence of God, and under his impartial Eye; and be sure that you chuse for him. Be not by assed by Preju∣dice, Partiality, Disaffection, or personal Favour in
<PB N="49" REF="004153_0052_1003B6D5AA9ED7C8"/>
your Choice: But let the known Worth and Fitness of Persons determine you. Such as have a Seat in his Majesty's Council, have a very great and weigh∣ty Trust reposed in them; and superior Powers are needful rightly to discharge it. Such had need to be Men of exce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing distinguishing Knowlege and Wisdom; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> your Choice you must have re∣spect to these Qualifications: but these are not all that are necessary; in designing Men to this high Station, principal Regard must be had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Religion, that they be Men of sincere Piety: And if Persons are void of this, how eminent soever they may be, for their other Accomplishments, yet by all Means let them be rejected. Among other Things, which the Council is betrusted withal, it must be remem∣bred, that they are an eminent Branch of the Le∣gislature, and so bear a special Part in framing our Laws: They also with the Governour, Constitute our Judges and Justices; and the Oversight of the College, is in Part committed to them. Chuse Men then, that having Religion near their Hearts, mourn our Degeneracies, tremble for the Ark of God, and will address themselves with unfainting Appli∣cation, for the reviving Religion among us, the re∣gaining and securing the gracious Presence of God with us. Particularly, Those that will be ready to bring forward such wholsome Laws, as are necessary and useful to advance Religion; and concern'd to appoint suitable Persons to Execute such Laws; and will take Care of the College, that it answer the End which our most excellent Predecessors and renowned Fore-Fathers had in founding it.</P>
<P>And now, with a thankful Acknowlegement of the many good and excellent Laws, which former Assemblies have Enacted to promote Religion a∣mong us; I would humbly request of this honour∣able
<PB N="50" REF="004153_0053_1003D910AEB51B88"/>
Great and General Assembly here present, to take Religion into their serious Consideration, and in their Wisdom meditate, whether some other Laws may not be made, that will befriend the Interest of it? It is our Life, the one Thing needful; it is our all. You cannot (my Fathers) employ your selves about a bigger, or better Thing.</P>
<P>Will you allow me here to suggest one or two Things.</P>
<P>It is to be feared that Persons negligence in at∣tending the publick Worship of the Sanctuary, is daily growing upon us; can nothing further be done for the Remedy of it?</P>
<P>And does not the Sin of Drunkenness dreadfully increase among us? Bringing with it, Woes, Mi∣series and Mischiefs of all Sorts. May not some∣thing more be done to suppress so great an Evil? The licensing of unqualified Persons, to be Inn∣holders and Retailers; and the multiplying Houses to sell strong Drink, may justly be thought to be the great Causes of this deluge of Debauchery, that is flowing in upon us. If Persons who have little or no Conscience, come to be Innholders or Retailers, they will allow of vile Disorders; and will not care how much they corrupt their Neighbours, if they can gain by it themselves. Such Houses will prove the Nurseries of Vice, Disorder &amp; Irreligion. And the needless multiplying of Taverns, &amp; other Houses of publick Licence among a People, is of pernicious Consequence unto them. What are they up and down in a Town, but so many Traps and Snares to catch and destroy the lovers of strong Drink. They are Temptations to such, and the more there are of them, and the nearer they are to
<PB N="51" REF="004153_0054_1003D915A86F0F18"/>
them, the more likelihood there is of their being undone by them. Can nothing now be done by the Legislature, for the removal of these Nusances? We ask of our honourable Rulers these two Things; The one is, that no Person be allowed to sell strong Drink, but what are of approved Sobriety, and good Conversation, Men of Honesty and good Or∣der. The other is, that Houses for this Purpose, be not needlesly multiplied.</P>
<P>I am sensible, that there is a Law, which prohi∣bits any to be Licensed to sell strong Drink, but such as are approbated by the Select-Men of a Town. But then it is not enjoyned upon such as are vested with Power of granting Licences, that all such shall be Licensed. And it is to be hoped, that those that are immediately concerned in that Affair, will not look upon such an Approbation, as a safe Rule, al∣ways to be relied upon, and to go by.</P>
<P>There is one Thing more which I would recom∣mend to the serious Consideration of this Great and General Court; and that is, Whether there is not a great Duty lying upon us, respecting the Trans∣actions of the Year 1692, when not only many Persons were taken off by the Hand of publick Justice for the supposed Crime of Witchcraft; but their Estates also ruined, and their Families impo∣verished. None dispute the Integrity of those, who were then concerned to act and judge most in those Matters. But it was a dark Day with them; they walk'd in the Clouds, and could not clearly see their way, as to the Mystery of Iniquity then working. All Orders of Persons have since seen Reason to condemn the Rules of the whole Process as fallaci∣ous and insufficient to distinguish the Guilty from
<PB N="52" REF="004153_0055_1003B6DA8A32F258"/>
the Innocent<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the Rev. Mr. <HI>Hale's</HI> accurate and judicious Discourse concerning Witchcraft, shewing how Persons guilty of that Crime may be convicted; and in which the Means used for their discovery are discussed both negatively and affirmative∣ly, according to Scripture and Experience.</NOTE>. What the Sense even of our Pre∣decessors, and those who were then upon the Stage of Action was, in relation to this Affair, may be in some measure learned from a Proclamation for a General Fast, emitted <HI>Decemb.</HI> 17. 1696, four Years after; in which is contained this Direction for pub∣lick Prayers, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>That God would shew us what we know not, and help us wherein we have done amiss, to do so no more: And especially that whatever Mistakes on either Hand, have been fallen into, either by the body of this People, or any order of Men, referring to the late Tragedy raised by Satan and his Instruments, thro' the awful Judgments of God: He would humble us therefor, and pardon all the Errors of his Ser∣vants and People, that desire to love his Name; and be atoned to his Land.</Q></P>
<P>Now tho' the loss of Parents cannot be made up to their surviving Posterity, yet their Estates may: And the Question is (if it be not beyond all Question) whether a Restitution is not due from the Publick to them, and we are not bound in Justice to make it. Hereby Infamy may be taken off from the Names and Memory of such as were Executed, and who it may be did not in the least deserve it; as well as a Reparation made to their Children for the Injuries done them; who remain to this Day among us in mean, low and abject Circumstances. It is now something more than forty Years since these sad Things were done among us; but length of Time is no Argument that God is not at
<PB N="53" REF="004153_0056_1003B6F400B27F50"/>
this Day, among other Things, contending with us for these; since he punished <HI>Israel</HI> with Famine three Years for a Sin of misguided Zeal committed forty Years before that, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> xxi.1, 2.</P>
<P>I am speaking of the Ways whereby our civil Rulers may promote the Interest of Religion among us. And I now proceed to say, that another Way, is, by putting the Execution of the Laws made for this Purpose, into the Hands of well-accomplished, and well-qualified Persons.</P>
<P>Will his EXCELLENCY then, and the HO∣NOURABLE BOARD, suffer me to intreat them, care∣fully to heed this. Appoint none to this momen∣tous Business, but such as are Men of Knowlege, and well acquainted with the Laws; Men of Re∣ligion, that will lay out themselves with Courage and Zeal to execute them. To design Men to take Care of the Interest of Religion, that have none themselves; how incongruous would this be? And what could we expect from such? Will they in good earnest seek the advancement of what they hate? With what Face and Courage can they ex∣ecute the good Laws upon Offenders, who live in the violation of them themselves? Will they dis∣countenance Sin &amp; Vice among a People, who are daily encouraging it by their Practice? Such must be good Men, as well as knowing Men; otherwise they will be like to destroy more good, than they will do.</P>
<P>And now, I would with suitable Deference ap∣ply my self, to our honourable Judges and Justices. And what is now requested of you, is, the vigo∣rous, faithful, impartial Execution of all those wholesome and good Laws, which are made, or may be made, for the encouraging of Piety and
<PB N="54" REF="004153_0057_1003D943BA66B2E8"/>
Virtue, and the discouraging of Vice and Wicked∣ness. <HI>Take heed</HI> (Sirs) <HI>what ye do: for ye judge not for Men, but for the Lord, who is with you in the Judgment. Wherefore now, let the fear of the Lord be upon you; take heed and do it: for there is no In∣iquity with the Lord our God, nor respect of Persons, nor taking of Gifts,</HI> 2 Chron. xix.6, 7.</P>
<P>And it is greatly to be wished for, that Under∣Officers, <HI>Grand Jurors</HI> and <HI>Tything-Men</HI> especially, would remember the Oath of God, which they are put under; and be quickned thereby faithfully to discharge what they are so solemnly obliged unto. And may such as are faithful, have all possible En∣couragement given them, in the way of their Duty.</P>
<P>I go on to say, It greatly serves the Interest of Religion in our Churches, when they are supplied with a learned, orthodox and godly Ministry; and this is the Province of our civil Rulers. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> xvii.8, 9. And they should encourage the Hearts, and strengthen the Hands of the Ministers of Christ, in the regular discharge of their Office. Their faithfulness may sometimes expose them, to the rage and fury of unreasonable and wicked Men: You, who <HI>are the Shields of our Earth,</HI> should guard them against their Insults. With good <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> you should <HI>speak comfortably to them.</HI> And like him, and that excellent Governour, <HI>Nehemiah</HI>; take care, that they be supported; that being freed from the Cares and Incumbrances of the World, they may give themselves wholly to their Work.</P>
<P>And now, let me recommend unto our civil Ru∣lers, the good Education of the <HI>Children</HI> and <HI>Youth</HI> among this People. Let not the Laws made, for the support of lesser Schools thro' the Land, be sham'd and eluded, as too often they have shamefully been.
<PB N="55" REF="004153_0058_1003D91EEA482090"/>
And let the great School of the Prophets, be ten∣derly cherished, maintained, and carefully inspect∣ed by you. Take care, that the College be a Se∣minary of pure and undefiled Religion, as well as good Literature.</P>
<P>We would mourn this Day the Death of the late reverend and honoured President of that Society<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Benjamin Wadsworth.</HI></NOTE>, and our great Loss therein; for he was a faithful Man, and feared God above many. May God, with whom is the residue of the Spirit, fill up that vacan∣cy with One that shall be a rich Blessing to the Col∣lege, and to the whole Land. May those, who are more immediately concerned, in fixing a President there, be directed to chuse One that is of eminent Learning and Wisdom, of found Principles, a fast Friend to these Churches, endow'd with a Spirit of Government; and to crown every Thing else, one of shining Piety; who will make it his Business, to promote vital Religion, as well as Learning, among our Youth: exhorting and comforting and charg∣ing every one of them as a Father doth his Chil∣dren. This is the way to have a converted Mini∣stry, without which we must not expect a convert∣ing Ministry.</P>
<P>Our religious Interests have a great dependance upon the College. If that Fountain be kept pure, the <HI>Streams thereof will make glad the City of God</HI>; but if corrupted, the Churches will soon be infect∣ed. So it far'd with the <HI>Belgick Churches,</HI> when one of their illustrious Schools, became such a troubled Fountain.</P>
<P>Permit me (Honourable Rulers) to mention one Thing more, which may greatly conduce to the ad∣vancement of Religion among us, and that is, your
<PB N="56" REF="004153_0059_1003B6F7D04AFD70"/>
setting good Examples before us. Examples are very influencial, especially the Examples of Rulers are so. This is evident from the Carriage of God's People of old, who commonly walked with, or con∣trary to God, as their Kings, were good or bad. If then you would have your People behave sober∣ly, righteously and godly; see to it, that you lead sober, righteous, and godly Lives your selves.</P>
<P>So have I put our civil Fathers in remembrance of several Ways, that are to be taken by them, for our Reformation. Will you now be pleased to a∣rise to the Work, with an unwearied Application. God, we hope, will succeed and prosper your sin∣cere and pious Endeavours. However this be, they will find acceptance with God thro' Christ; you will enjoy the Satisfaction and Pleasure of having done your Duty; and shall not miss of the Reward of good and faithful Servants in the heavenly World.</P>
<P>I come now,</P>
<P N="2">2. To address my reverend Fathers and Brethren in the Ministry. And let me beseech you to use your constant, painful, and faithful Endeavours to promote the Interest of Religion among us. Our recovery from that Apostacy, that we are fallen in∣to, as to outward Means, does principally depend upon such your Endeavours; and they are no more than what God and Man expect from you, and you are solemnly obliged to.</P>
<P><HI>Reverend and much Esteemed:</HI> Allow me here, mean and unworthy as I am, to put you in mind of a few Things, the observance of which, may greatly contribute to the advancement of the King∣dom and Interest of Christ among us.</P>
<P>And in the first Place, I humbly propose, that as the Apostle Paul among his <HI>Corinthians,</HI> so we a∣mong our people, <HI>determine to know nothing, but
<PB N="57" REF="004153_0060_1003D94561DDE818"/>Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</HI> Let Christ be the principal Subject of our Preaching. Let us lift him up on high in our Congregations, and display his Glory before our People. The glory of his Divi∣nity, the glory of his Humanity, and the glory of the Constitution of the Person of Christ, who is both God and Man in one Person. Let us preach of the Offices of Christ, of his precious Benefits, of the indearing Relations he stands in to his People's and of his most excellent Example. Is Christ the very Marrow, Soul and Scope of the holy Scrip∣tures? Then such Sermons, as have much of Christ in them, come nearest to those sacred Records, and we may conclude are most likely to do good. It is justly to be feared (Sirs) that one great Cause of the woful decay of vital Piety in the christian Church, is the neglect which has been in preaching Christ. Let us hear what the excellent Dr. <HI>Watts</HI> says, <Q>Let us Ministers consider how little has been our <HI>Success,</HI> in comparison of the Multitudes converted by our Fathers, in the Day of their Ministry. Now it is worth our In∣quiry, Whether it may not be ascribed unto the <HI>Absence of Christ</HI> in our Sermons. And what Reason indeed can we have, to expect the Pre∣sence and Influence of the Spirit of Christ, if we leave his Person, his Offices, his Grace, and his Gospel, out of our Discourses; or give but a slight and casual Hint at those glorious Subjects, which ought to be our daily Theme!</Q> Blessed be God, we have had Fathers, who have been e∣minent for their preaching of Christ. And it is Matter of Thankfulness, that we yet have Fathers among us, who account, <Q>Christ the favourite Subject in the Course of their Studies for the Pulpit</Q>. Let us, my Brethren, by all Means copy after them.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="004153_0061_1003D9224DC786E0"/>I go on to say, that the Truths of the Gospel, particularly, the important Doctrines of Grace, are a most precious Treasure committed to our Custody. <HI>O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy Trust.</HI> But how should we keep them? Surely, not to our selves, so locking up the Key of Knowlege. But we must communicate them to others; we should preach those important Doctrines to our People. Give me leave to mention some of them, even as I find them laid down and expressed in a Pamphlet among us, bearing this Title, <HI>A seasonable Testimo∣ny to the glorious Doctrines of Grace, at this Day ma∣ny Ways undermined in the World</HI>: Considered by a general Convention of Ministers, meeting at <HI>Boston, May 28th. 1702</HI>; and voted by them, to be pub∣lished, for the Establishment of the Churches in the present Truth.</P>
<P>They are such as these. <Q><HI>That</HI> the most high God, hath from all Eternity elected certain Per∣sons from among the Children of Men, to be brought unto eternal Happiness, in and by Jesus Christ; and this Decree was not founded in the <HI>Foresight</HI> of any Merit or Goodness in the Cho∣sen, but in the meer good Pleasure of God, who made choice of them: <HI>That</HI> the elected of God, are in his everlasting <HI>Covenant of Redemption,</HI> after a peculiar Manner given unto our <HI>Lord Messiah,</HI> who therein undertook to be their <HI>Head,</HI> and their Redeemer: <HI>That</HI> the <HI>Redeemed</HI> of the Lord, shall be in his Time and Way, every one of them infallibly made Partakers of effectual Vocation, and have the Benefits which he hath purchased for them applied to them. <HI>That</HI> fal∣len Man having lost the <HI>Freedom of his Will to spiritual Good,</HI> he will not believe and repent, and answer the Call of the Gospel, until <HI>su∣pernatural Operation</HI> of the Spirit of Grace upon
<PB N="59" REF="004153_0062_1003B6E3A5EBA828"/>
him, do change his Will; which Operation is bestowed in a Way of meer sovereign Grace, upon those only that are ordained unto Life. <HI>That</HI> upon a Sinner's accepting that Favour of God by Faith, God imputes to him the <HI>Righte∣ousness</HI> of that active &amp; passive Obedience, with which the Lord Jesus Christ, appearing as the Surety of his People, has fully answered the Law of God for them; and the Sinner is <HI>justified</HI> be∣fore God, in that Righteousness of the Lord Je∣sus Christ. <HI>That</HI> every Believer on the Lord Jesus Christ, being by Faith united unto him, does henceforth glorify his Lord, in doing the good Works of <HI>evangelical Obedience,</HI> by a Strength derived from him; which <HI>good Works</HI> are the Fruit and Proof, but not the Cause of his Justi∣fication. And finally, That the Saints of God, shall persevere in their Sanctity, and nothing shall make them fall totally and finally from that Grace, wherein they stand, and may <HI>rejoyce in the Hope of the Glory of God.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now when I say, that these great Truths of the Gospel should be preach'd; none will understand so, as if I thought the preaching of christian and evangelical Duties were a needless Thing; no, we must <HI>not shun to declare the whole Counsel of God,</HI> but must preach the before mentioned Truths, as the Foundation of practical Religion, &amp; without which the Life and Power of Godliness is not like to be maintained! 'Twas well said by Dr. <HI>Owen,</HI> <Q><HI>Gos∣pel-Truth</HI> is the only Root whereon Gospel-Ho∣liness will grow. If any Worm corrode, or any other corrupting Accident befall it, the Fruit will quickly fade and decay. It is impossible to maintain the <HI>Power of Godliness,</HI> where the Doc∣trine
<PB N="60" REF="004153_0063_1003D926F194EAB8"/>
from whence it springs is unknown, cor∣rupted, or despised <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See him of the Nature and Causes of Apostacy from the Gospel. Page 436</NOTE></Q>.</P>
<P>I proceed,</P>
<P>To say, It may very much promote the Interest of Religion among us, to insist upon the great Doc∣trine of Conversion; making that one grand Sub∣ject of our preaching. It was excellently spoken by a dear Brother, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Rev. Mr. <HI>Wigglesworth</HI></NOTE>. in an <HI>Election-Sermon</HI> preach'd here, four Years ago, <Q>I know not how we can begin with our Flocks better, than the great Pro∣phet and Teacher did with <HI>Nicodemus, Except a Man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God,</HI> John iii.3.</Q> Let us teach the Nature of Conversion. Let us press the Necessity of it. And since the Law is our School-master to bring us to Christ, let us in the most clear and affecting Man∣ner we can, represent to Sinners the dreadful Mi∣series of Hell, that they are exposed unto, and are in daily Danger of. Though our blessed Lord, was anointed to preach the Gospel to the Poor; yet how frequently do we find him preaching up the Doctrine of Hell-torments to the Impenitent and Secure? It is needful that in this Way, sleepy Sin∣ners should be awakened; this is some Preparation to a sound Conversion. And since the Heart is so very deceitful, and Men are so apt to think them∣selves rich, &amp; increased with Goods, and have need of nothing; when they are wretched, and mise∣rable, and poor, and blind, and naked; it seems very necessary, that in our preaching, we labour to discover what those Grounds, Reasonings or Pretences are, upon which Men build their Confi∣dence, and shew the Rottenness &amp; Fallacy of 'em.
<PB N="61" REF="004153_0064_1003D949CE894488"/>
It was the saying of a Soul-searching Preacher, and happy Instrument in the Hands of God, of convert∣ing many a Soul to him; <Q>For my own part, if I had but one Sermon to preach while I lived, I think this should be it; to preach down all un∣grounded Hopes of Heaven: not to leave you there in Despair, but that you may Hope upon better Grounds, which will never deceive you <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Baxter</HI>'s Saints R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st. p. 36</NOTE></Q>. Our Discourses should be adapted to reach Mens Consciences, and not to please their Fancies.</P>
<P>And then, let us take Time for, and Pains in composing our Sermons: And when we have made them, let us labour to get our own sinful Hearts in∣to a due and solemn Frame to deliver them. It is a known Saying of the famous Mr. <HI>Shepard</HI> of <HI>Cam∣bridge,</HI> and it deserves to be written in Letters of Gold upon our Study-Doors: <Q>God will curse that Man's Labours, that lumbers up and down in the World all the Week, and then upon Saturday in the Afternoon, goes to his Study: whenas God knows, that Time were little enough to pray in, and weep in, and get his Heart into a fit Frame for the Duties of the approaching Sabbath <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his Life, in Dr. <HI>Mather</HI>'s History of <HI>New England.</HI> Book 3 p. 90</NOTE></Q>. O let us take Pains in our Preparations for the Pul∣pit! Let them smell of the Lamp; let them be beaten Oil for the Sanctuary; having in the first place, sought to God to direct and assist us therein. And then, let us beg of God, that the holy Truths which we have got to deliver to others, may first be impress'd on our own Hearts, that we may speak of them in a very lively manner. Very much de∣pends upon this: for it is the Mind that convinces the Mind; and the Heart, that perswades the Heart.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="004153_0065_1003D92DE59673A8"/>
If we are burning and flaming in our own Breasts, there is the greater likelihood of inkindling holy Affections, in the Hearts of others.</P>
<P>Ministers should be Men of <HI>Prayer.</HI> We must give our selves unto Prayer, as well as to the Mi∣nistry of the Word. And in our Prayers respect must be had to the Success of the Word preached by us, that it may run and be glorified; prove ef∣fectual to the Conversion of Sinners, and the Edi∣fication of the Saints and People of God. "That Preaching that is not accompanied with continual Prayer for it's Success, is not like to have any great Blessing go along with it."</P>
<P>I find that holy Man of God, but now mention∣ed, viz. Mr. <HI>Shepard</HI> at such Strains of Piety as these; <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Vide p. 9I, of the fore mentioned Book.</NOTE> <Q>I saw my Blessedness did not lie in <HI>receiv∣ing</HI> of <HI>Good</HI> &amp; <HI>Comfort</HI> from God, but in <HI>hold∣ing forth</HI> the <HI>Glory</HI> of God, and his <HI>Virtues.</HI> For 'tis, I saw, an amazing glorious Object, <HI>to see God in the Creature!</HI> God speak, God act; the Deity not being the Creature, nor turned into it; but filling of it, shining through it; to be covered with God as with a Cloud, or as a Glass Lan∣thorn to have his Beams penetrate through it.—I saw it was my Misery to hold forth <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Satan</HI> and <HI>Self</HI> in my Course. And I saw one of these two Things must be done. Now because my Soul wanted <HI>Pleasure,</HI> I purposed then to <HI>hold forth</HI> God; and did hope it should be my <HI>Pleasure</HI> so to do, as it would be my Pain to do otherwise</Q>. O Sirs, this is what we have got to do, even in our Persons and Walkings, to hold forth and represent the Graces of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holiness of his Doctrine, which we preach.</P>

To express his Humility, his Meekness, Self-Denial, readiness for the Cross, contempt of the World, heavenly Mindedness, Benignity, Condescension, Patience, &amp;c. Such a Life as this, tends greatly to the Success of our Ministry. It commands Res∣pect and Reverence from our People, and our Preaching will come with more Authority, Force and Energy, and sink deeper into their Souls. When we exemplify the holy Doctrine, which we Preach in our Actions, and live the Sermons which we deliver to others, this has a silent power of At∣traction in it, to draw Men to their Duty. Besides God will honour such as thus honour him, 1 Sam. ii.30. And will delight to succeed their Labours.— <HI>He walked with me in Peace and Equity, and did turn many away from Iniquity,</HI> Mal. ii.6. On the other Hand, when a Minister in the Course of his Life, holds forth the Beast, or the Devil; I mean the Lusts of the Flesh, or the Lusts of the Spirit; he becomes contemptible, and deservedly so, Mat. v.I3. And if once his Person is contemned, so will his Preaching be; and Men will not regard what he says. How much then does it concern us, that in all Things, we shew our selves Patterns of good Works. Tit. ii.7. That we be <HI>Examples of the Be∣lievers, in Word, in Conversation, in Charity, in Spi∣rit, in Faith, in Purity.</HI></P>
<P>With Intrepidity of Soul, let us faithfully rebuke the growing Sins of the Times &amp; Places, in which we live. That Scripture should be often founding in our Ears, Ezek iii.17, 18. <HI>Son of Man, I have made thee a Watchman to the House of Israel: there∣fore hear the Word at my Mouth, and give them warn∣ing from me. When I say unto the Wicked, thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not Warning, nor speakest to warn the Wicked from his Way to save his Life; the same wicked Man shall die in his Iniquity;
<PB N="64" REF="004153_0067_1003B6FB79E79FA8"/>
but his Blood will I require at thine Hand.</HI> Let us be sollicitous to understand our Duty; and when we know it, let us be bold and daring to do it. It was an honourable Character, that was given by a Great Man <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Earl of <HI>Murray.</HI></NOTE>, of Mr. <HI>Knox,</HI> that eminent Reformer in <HI>Scotland,</HI> at his Interment; <Q>Here lies the Body of him, who in his life Time never feared the Face of any Man</Q>.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Clark's Marrow of Ecclesiastical History. Book 1 p. 343.</NOTE> Let us be fond of the Cha∣racter our selves; and not fear the Faces, nor spare the Faults of any Offenders, when called of God to Reprove them. Isai. lviii.1. <HI>Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy Voice like a Trumpet, and shew my People their Transgression, and the House of Jacob their Sins.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Catechising</HI> is a most needful and excellent Work. And what not only Parents and Heads of Families are called to, but Ministers also. Most express are the Words of our blessed Lord to <HI>Peter,</HI> and in him to all succeeding Ministers of the Gospel, <HI>Feed my Lambs.</HI> And where shall be find a better Catechism, than that which one of the greatest and best Men <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Dr.<HI>Usher</HI> so pronounced of the Assemblies Catechism.</NOTE> that ever the Irish Church saw, declares to be the best extant in the World. Let us see to it, that the young Ones of our Flocks, get this by Heart: And not only so, but let us take Pains, to lead them in∣to a good Understanding of the great Truths and Duties of Christianity contained therein. And when this is done, let us select some of the weigh∣tiest Points, and apply them to their tender Souls in a warm Address: This is the Life of all, and may prove a Means of their early and saving Con∣version to God.</P>
<P>Abundance of Good may be done among our People, by visiting of them; and entertaining them,
<PB N="65" REF="004153_0068_1003D936E9BA5B98"/>
with our pious Discourse; suiting them with agre∣able Addresses; instructing, exhorting, reproving, counselling, and comforting them, as there is Oc∣casion. And perhaps, we may receive, as well as do a great deal by such Visits. Rom. xv.24. The Apostle speaking there to the believing <HI>Romans,</HI> says, <HI>Whensoever I shall take my Journey into Spain, I will come unto you: for I trust to see you in my Jour∣ney, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your Company.</HI> The Communion of Saints is filling, not empty, vain and frothy, as the Company of most is; but admi∣nistring Grace and Comfort to those that enjoy it. Let us then, as our more weighty Duties will allow attend this part of Duty also.</P>
<P>Before I pass from this Head of Visiting, allow me to say, we should as we have Opportunity there∣for, make our friendly Visits to each other. In such Visits, Men of your high Station and Character, will disdain a low, grovelling, insipid, trifling Con∣versation. Your Conversation with each other, will be polite and learned; by all Means let it be re∣ligious too. 'Tis said of those two excellent Mi∣nisters of Christ, Bishop <HI>Usher,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Preston,</HI> That after much Discourse of Learning and other Matters had between them, the Bishop would say, "Come Doctor, One Word of CHRIST now before" we part. Beautiful! charming Example! But I'll go higher than this. We read of the Seraphims, Isai. 6.3. <HI>That one cried unto another, and said, Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord of Hosts, the whole Earth is full of his Glory.</HI> They cried one to another, and said; as if they would by their holy, and heavenly Language, inflame each other's Breasts. Let now the Angels of the Churches, go and do likewise.</P>
<P>If after all, we meet with Sufferings from those, to whom for Christ's Sake, we have (thro' Grace)
<PB N="66" REF="004153_0069_1003D94C4AECF770"/>
been faithful Servants; with base and unworthy Treatment from those, for whose good, we have spent our Lives and Strength, let us not be surpri∣sed at it. It is a Temptation, but common to the best of Ministers. It is to try our Patience! O for the Gospel Sake, that that be not hindred, let it have it's perfect Work in us. Let us now, <HI>not be overcome of Evil, but overcome Evil with Good.</HI> In such a Case as this, let us hearken to the good Ad∣vice, which the venerable old Mr. <HI>Eliot,</HI> was wont to give his Brethren, when complaining to him, that such and such in their Flocks were too difficult for them. <Q>Brother, (says he) Compass them! And, Brother, Learn the Meaning of those three little Words, <HI>Bear, forbear, forgive.</HI></Q> Brethren! Let none of these Things move us, neither let us <HI>count our Lives dear unto us, so that we may finish our Course with Joy, and the Ministry which we have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the Gospel of the Grace of God.</HI> Let us soar above 'em. Let us live above 'em, even in Heaven, and then we shall bet∣ter bear the Hardships, which we may meet withal here upon Earth. Are our Labours of Love, ill-rewarded by Men? Let us be <HI>stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the Work of the Lord; for as much as we know that our Labour is not in vain in the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>There is one Thing more, which I can't well pass over; suffer me to offer that, and I shall have done. It is, that we be very careful to maintain Peace and Unity among ourselves; and not suffer different Sentiments in smaller Matters to divide us, and drive us into Parties. You are very sensi∣ble (Rev. Sirs,) that as the Truths of our holy Religion, are not all equally great and necessary; for neither are they all alike clearly revealed. Some Truths compared with others are lesser, more darkly
<PB N="67" REF="004153_0070_1003B6EF204AD0B0"/>
revealed, and far less discernable. Hence it can∣not be expected, but that we shall have different Apprehensions about 'em; tho' at the same time, we may be well agreed, in the more weighty Mat∣ters of the Gospel. What shall we do in this Case? Different Apprehensions in many Matters of Reli∣gion, we shall have while here in this World; so many, so various, are the Causes of 'em, that it is impossible it should be otherwise with us. Unity of the Faith is not to be expected, till we get to Hea∣ven; or the new Jerusalem comes down from God out of Heaven. Shall we grow cold in our Regards and Affections to one another? Shall we grow an∣gry with one another, because of these unavoidable different Sentiments? By no Means. But let us be kindly affectioned one to another with brother∣ly Love, in Honour preferring one another, not∣withstanding. Let us not spend any of our Time in wrangling &amp; bitter Disputes, about these lower, dark and doubtful Matters: Let us not spend too much of our short Time in any kind of Disputes a∣bout them; but keeping them in their due Subordi∣nation, let us with one Heart and Hand, with one Shoulder and Consent, lay out our selves in pro∣moting the common Interest of Christ's Kingdom, and the common Salvation of precious and immor∣tal Souls. By all Means, let us espouse generous Principles; let us breathe a catholick Spirit; let us be one with every one, that is one with Jesus Christ; whether they be Lutherans, or Calvinists, Episco∣palians, or Presbyterians, Congregationalists, or An∣tipoedobaptists; or whatever other Denomination they may be of. I have met with a Passage of the very excellent Mr. <HI>Matthew Henry,</HI> which seems worthy of a Remark, with which I shall close this Head. <Q>The Differences (says he) that are among Christians, tho' fomented by the Malice
<PB N="68" REF="004153_0071_1003B6FF78C60EC0"/>
of Satan for the Ruin of Love, are permitted by the Wisdom of God for the Tryal of Love, that <HI>they which are perfect</HI> therein <HI>may be manifest.</HI> Herein a Christian commendeth his Love, when he loves those who differ from him, and joins in Affection to those with whom he cannot concur in Opinion.</Q></P>
<P>Thus I have presum'd to address the Fathers of the Country, civil and ecclesiastical; and having spoken to 'em separately, what if I should now join them together? May they ever be so in their Esteem of Love and Affection to each other. So <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> met in the Mount of God, and kissed each other. And it might very much conduce to the Advancement of Religion among us, if these two Orders of Men would join their Counsels, &amp; unite in their Consultations about the Ways &amp; Methods in which to pursue it.</P>
<P>But it is high Time for me to come to a Conclusion. If then we were constant &amp; fervent in our Prayers and Supplications for the Effusions of the Holy Spirit upon us; and were our Prayers accompanied with our sincere &amp; vigorous Endeavours to carry on a Work of Reformation? Did we in the several Places in which God hath set us, whether private or publick, lay out ourselves to promote the Interest of dying Re∣ligion among us; we might then hope, that we should not be termed, forsaken &amp; desolate; nor made to sigh out our Ichabod, and say, the Glory is depart∣ed from us; but that the Name whereby we shall be called, shall be <HI>Jehovah Shammah,</HI> the Lord is there. And <HI>happy is that People, whose God is the Lord.</HI></P>
