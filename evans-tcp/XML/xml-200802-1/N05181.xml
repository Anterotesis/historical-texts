banished from your Breast. While with a melancholly Pleasure, you review her amiable Character, it will greatly asswage your Sorrow, to reflect, how happily prepared she was for that World, to which, it pleased God, so suddenly to remove her. Were these the Remains of a perfect Stranger, you would doubtless peruse them with Delight, for the sublime Sentiments of Piety and Devotion, which they contain: But they must come with a singular Advantage, when you consider them as the pious Breathings of a Woman, with whom you was many Years united, in the tender Tyes of a conjugal Relation.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="006530_0004_10292F44B9959F78"/>YOUR Loss, it must be acknow∣ledged, was very great: And, I may be allowed to say, I had a deep Share in that awful Providence. When you was deprived of the Companion of your Bosom, I lost the Best of Mothers. Blessed be God, we sorrow not, as others <HI>which have no Hope!</HI> We daily' saw, for her TO LIVE WAS CHRIST; and have therefore the highest Assurance, TO DIE WAS GAIN.

<HEAD>THE LIFE and CHARACTER OF Mrs. MARY LLOYD.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE is so irresistible a <HI>Charm</HI> in undissembled <HI>Ver∣tue,</HI> that there are but few, who do not profess to admire its Excellence: —Something so <HI>shocking</HI> in the naked Deformity of <HI>Vice,</HI> that the most corrupt Minds are ashamed to own their Attachment to it. But when Men are exhorted, to regulate their Lives by the sacred Precepts of <HI>Religion,</HI> how apt are they to look upon it as a vain and impracticable Attempt; and complain that it offers Vio∣lence to Human Nature, by laying an <HI>un∣reasonable Restraint</HI> upon the Appetites of
<PB N="2" REF="006530_0008_10292F520EC1C178"/>
Flesh and Blood. To remove these ground∣less Prejudices, the inspired Scriptures set before us, the bright Cloud of antient Wit∣nesses, who have <HI>shone</HI> as <HI>Lights</HI> a dark and degenerate World; and earnestly invite us to be <HI>Followers of them, who thro' Faith and Patience inherit the Promises.</HI> And perhaps, nothing affords greater Encourage∣ment to serious Minds, than to find that Men of <HI>like</HI> Passions, placed in the <HI>same dangerous</HI> Circumstances, and surrounded with <HI>equal</HI> Trials and Temptations, have, by the Assistance of divine Grace, bravely conquered the Difficulties of the Christian Life, and <HI>ran with Patience the Race set before them.</HI> This shows us, that Religion is not a bare <HI>abstracted Theory,</HI> contrived for the Entertainment of <HI>speculative</HI> Minds; but is an undoubted <HI>Reality,</HI> of which many of our Fellow-Creatures have felt the trans∣forming Power in their Hearts; and exem∣plified in an amiable and vertuous Conduct. This has the highest Tendency to encourage others, to imitate those <HI>instructive Patterns,</HI> who in their Day were illustrious <HI>Ornaments</HI> of the Church, and diffusive <HI>Blessings</HI> to Mankind. Upon this Account, the <HI>Lives</HI> of <HI>eminent Saints,</HI> have always been esteemed the most <HI>valuable,</HI> Part of Ecclesiastical
<PB N="3" REF="006530_0009_10292F55EC10E628"/>
History. In this Way, they have <HI>spoke</HI> to Survivors, even when sleeping in the <HI>Silence of Death,</HI> and extended the Influence of their Piety, to distant Places, and thro' succeeding Ages.</P>
<P>THERE is a <HI>public Honour</HI> due to Per∣sons of dishnguish'd Worth: Whilst they <HI>live,</HI> we cannot publish their Vertues, with∣out exposing <HI>them</HI> to the dangerous Temp∣tation of <HI>Pride,</HI> and <HI>ourselves</HI> to the Impu∣tation of a servile and designing <HI>Flattery.</HI> But when they are <HI>removed</HI> from this Stage of Vanity, and raised above the Censure or Applause of Mortals, we may <HI>safely</HI> propose their lovely Patterns, to the Attention and Imitation of Posterity. And indeed, it would be an <HI>Injury</HI> to Mankind, to suffer their superior Qualities, to <HI>lie buried</HI> in per∣petual Oblivion; and those Names which God has dignified by his Grace, to perish without any <HI>Mark</HI> of <HI>Distinction.</HI> When they are ascended above these Regions of Guilt and Darkness, and are entered into the <HI>General Assembly of the Church of the First-born,</HI> it becomes us who are still con∣fined to this Vale of Tears, and fighting under the Banner of the Cross, to <HI>perpetuate</HI> the Remembrance of their Vertues, and
<PB N="4" REF="006530_0010_10292F576D2C1E10"/>
ardently <HI>aspire after</HI> that State of Purity and Perfection, to which they are advanced.</P>
<P>ALL who had the Happiness of Mrs. LLOYD's Acquaintance, will be so just as to acknowledge, that in the present Age there have appeared, but few more excellent Examples of <HI>genuine</HI> Piety, and <HI>extensive</HI> Usefulness. Her <HI>Friends</HI> will be pleased, to have those extraordinary Qualities, placed in a proper Light, which rendered her their Delight and Admiration, while <HI>living,</HI> and will embalm her Memory, now she is <HI>dead. Strangers</HI> to her, may also from a Perusal of these Pages, be excited to despise the <HI>Pomps</HI> and <HI>Venities</HI> of Life; which are unworthy the Pursuit of a rational Creature; and to seek after those <HI>Endowments,</HI> which add a <HI>real Dignity</HI> to Human Nature, and pre∣pare for a superior State of Existence.</P>
<P>THESE Considerations have determined me, tho' in all respects unequal to the Task, to give some Account of her <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Character.</HI> The Reader must not ex∣pect a pompous Detail of <HI>Facts,</HI> diversified with a Variety of entertaining <HI>Incidents.</HI> — She maintained one uniform Tenor of <HI>Devo∣tion</HI> to the <HI>Supreme Being,</HI> and diligent
<PB N="5" REF="006530_0011_10292F5AAB9A3F28"/>
Attendance to the <HI>Duties</HI> of <HI>Common Life.</HI> She never affected a <HI>public Appearance</HI> be∣yond the Decency of her Station; not interfered with Affairs, foreign to her Sex. This will necessarily cut short the <HI>Historical</HI> Part of the following Performance. I shall principally enlarge upon her <HI>Character,</HI> which cannot, without the extremest Injustice, be confined in a very narrow Compass.</P>
<P>MRS. LLOYD was born at BOSTON, in NEW-ENGLAND. <HI>May</HI> 1681, of a good Family; being the only Child of Mr. <HI>John Clarke</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Mary Atwater.</HI> Her <HI>Father,</HI> a Commander of a Vessel, was, in her In∣fancy, carried into Captivity by the <HI>Corsairs</HI> of <HI>Barbary,</HI> who to this Day infest the <HI>Me∣diteranean</HI> Sea, and are the <HI>common Enemies</HI> of the trading Nations of <HI>Europe.</HI> These Barbarians generally use those who are so unfortunate as to fall into their Hands, with the greatest <HI>Cruelty:</HI> But Capt. <HI>Clarke</HI> being a Gentleman of Ingenuity and Address, met with uncommon <HI>Civility,</HI> and was exempted from that <HI>servile Drudgery</HI> to which most of their Prisoners are condemned. Here he was seized with that fatal Distemper, the <HI>Small∣Pox,</HI> of which he died in a few Days. — Her <HI>Mother</HI> was a Woman of superior Piety
<PB N="6" REF="006530_0012_10292F5E6C221880"/>
and, good Sense, and lived to the Age of Sixty three, in Honour and Usefulness. She was endued, with great Prudence; managed her houshold Affairs with the justest Eco∣nomy, and supported the Afflictions of Life with Patience and Resignation. She was familiar with the Thoughts of Death, even in her highest Health, and made it her <HI>prin∣cipal Business</HI> to prepare for that important Event. When she felt its first Approaches, she received it not as the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Terrors,</HI> but as a <HI>Messenger</HI> of <HI>Joy</HI> —the Angel of her Deliverance. <Q>The Blessed Day, (says she) is come, which I have been so long ex∣pecting and preparing for.</Q> — And in a few Hours expired in the greatest Tranquility and Peace.</P>
<P>THIS Gentlewoman, after Capt, <HI>Clarke</HI>'s early Departure, continued several Years a disconsolate Widow. Afterwards she married Mr. <HI>John Coney</HI>; who always treated Mrs. <HI>Lloyd</HI> with the Affection and Tenderness of a <HI>Father.</HI> Under his Roof, she enjoyed all the Opportunities she could desire, to im∣prove in Knowledge and Vertue; and to obtain those <HI>other Qualifications,</HI> which were suitable to her Sex and Character. She had <HI>equal</HI> Advantages with his <HI>own</HI> Children:
<PB N="7" REF="006530_0013_10292F6105398E10"/>
I have often heard her say, that if at any Time a <HI>Distinction</HI> was made, it was gene∣rally in her Favour. She always spoke of this <HI>uncommon Generosity,</HI> with the greatest Thankfulness, and paid this worthy Gentle∣man, while he <HI>lived,</HI> all the Offices of <HI>Filial∣Piety.</HI> After his <HI>Death,</HI> she never mentioned his Name, without some <HI>singular</HI> Mark of Gratitude and Respect.</P>
<P>IN this agreeable Situation, Mrs. <HI>Lloyd</HI> passed the Days of her Youth; and by her vertuous, obliging Behaviour, recommended herself to the good Opinion of all who knew her. The <HI>Royal Preacher</HI> tells us, that <HI>Childhood and Youth are Vanity</HI>; and <HI>melan∣cholly Observation</HI> shows, that this <HI>beautiful</HI> Season of Life is generally lavished away in <HI>Amusements,</HI> if not spent in an entire <HI>Forget∣fulness</HI> of God, and the great End of our Being. But perhaps, never was any Person freer from the <HI>common Follies</HI> incident to Youth, than Mrs. <HI>Lloyd.</HI> The Principles of the divine Life, seemed to display them∣selves with the <HI>first Dawning</HI> of Reason. She often said, that she never knew the Time, when she began to be serious. From her very <HI>Infancy,</HI> she discovered a deep Abhorrence of every Vice, and an earnest Solicitude to
<PB N="8" REF="006530_0014_10292F6286E77C90"/>
devote herself to the Service of her Maker. From a <HI>Child,</HI> she read the <HI>Scriptures</HI> with unusual Delight,— observed her stated Hours of <HI>Retirement,</HI>— and took Pleasure to <HI>asso∣ciate</HI> herself with Persons of Eminence in Religion.</P>
<P>BUT, not with standing the Happiness of an unblemished Youth; She, in the early Years of Life, fell under a deep Conviction of her Guilt and Misery; and was, for many Months, anxiously solicitous for her immor∣tal Welfare. She found no <HI>Rest,</HI> but at the Footstool of sovereign and unmerited Grace; — no <HI>Safety,</HI> but in a fiducial Application, to the Merits and Mediation of <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> All her Days, she had the highest Relish for those Doctrines, which have the most appo∣site Tendency to <HI>humble</HI> the <HI>Pride</HI> of human Nature,—<HI>exalt</HI> the Riches of divine <HI>Grace,</HI>—and ascribe the entire Glory of Salvation to a crucified Redeemer.</P>
<P>THE Beauty, of her Person,—the Spright∣liness of her Wit, — the Charms of her Conversation, but above all, the <HI>unfeigned Piety</HI> which crowned her other Accomplish∣ments, soon procured her many Admirers. She had several advantageous Offers, of a
<PB N="9" REF="006530_0015_10292F64F8EC0198"/>
Settlement in the <HI>married</HI> Life. She fixed her Choice upon the Revd. Mr. <HI>Ebenezer Pemberton,</HI> Pastor of a flourshing <HI>Church</HI> in BOSTON; and one of the most celebrated Preachers of his Age. To this Gentleman she was married in the Year 1701. They lived together with mutual Delight and Sa∣tisfaction, till the Year 1717; when their Marriage Relation was dissolved, by the Death of Mr. <HI>Pemberton.</HI> They had seven Children: <HI>Three</HI> of which died in their In∣fancy; <HI>Four,</HI> thro' the good Providence of God, yet survive. May we be <HI>Heirs</HI> of that Grace which so eminently resided in our <HI>departed Parents,</HI> and follow them in their exemplary Course of Vertue!—Then, we shall shortly <HI>meet</HI> them again, in that blessed World, where will be no more Sorrow, Seperation, or Death!</P>
<P>THE indulgent Reader will allow me to <HI>shed</HI> a few <HI>Tears</HI> over the Grave of so ex∣cellent a Father; who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> instruction and Ex∣ample I lost, before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an Opportunity, to know their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Advantage. I shall not attempt his <HI>Character</HI>:—I am happily prevented by the <HI>Sermons</HI> occasioned by his Death, preached by the Revd. Drs. <HI>Colman</HI> and <HI>Sewall.</HI> His own printed Dis∣courses
<PB N="10" REF="006530_0016_10292F687A79AA60"/>
show, he had all the Qualifications requisite to constitute a great and a good Man. The <HI>masterly Reasoner,</HI>—the <HI>judicious Divine,</HI>—the <HI>servant Preacher,</HI>—the <HI>accom∣plished Orator,</HI> appear in almost every Page of his Writings. He spent his Life in the most assidous Labours, to enlarge and sup∣port the Kingdom of his Master. He died in the full Assurance of Faith, in <HI>triumphant</HI> Views of eternal Felicity. This was the Language of his <HI>faultring</HI> Tongue, in his expiring Moments, <Q>I thank God, who hath given me a good Hope thro' Christ. Notwithstanding my many Infirmities, both in public and private; thro' his Grace I have been enabled to be sincere and upright before him. And I can now look for an House not made with Hands, eternal in the Heavens, when this House of my earthly Tabernacle is dissolved. And this Hope is built only on the Merits of Christ, who hath suffered so much for me; who died, and is riser again, and lives for ever, to make Intercession for me. And upon this Foundation is built, my Hope for my self, my Family, my Church, and the whole Israel of God: And I thank God, who hath enabled me, in a dying Hour, to express this my Hope.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="006530_0017_10292F6AF734ACD8"/>THIS Loss must doubtless be very heavy to <HI>Her,</HI> who for many Years had been united with him, in the most <HI>delightful</HI> Society, and <HI>resin'd</HI> Friendship. Her tender and affecti∣onate Nature, was ready to sink under the severe Trial. But, she was enabled to glo∣rify God, in the <HI>Height</HI> of her Affliction; and exhibit to all around, an instructive <HI>Example</HI> of Christian Patience, and profound Submission, to the Will of her heavenly Father.</P>
<P>IN her Widowhood, as soon as her Cir∣cumstances would permit, she entered upon a <HI>retired</HI> Scene of Life; that she might with greater Freedom, converse with Heaven, and inspect the Education of her <HI>Children</HI>; who were now left under her immediate Direction. Perhaps, none ever manifested a more solicitous Concern for the Felicity of their <HI>Offspring,</HI> than Mrs. <HI>Lloyd</HI>; or, more incessantly <HI>travelled in Birth, that Christ might be formed in them.</HI> She lodged many an ardent <HI>Petition</HI> in the Court of Heaven, on their Behalf; and daily recommended them to the Grace of our Almighty Saviour. She requested nothing for them, with a <HI>passionate</HI> Importunity, but a Union to <HI>Christ,</HI> as their <HI>living Head</HI>; and an Admission into
<PB N="12" REF="006530_0018_10292F6C79FF4658"/>
the Number of his redeemed People. She rejoiced, to see them increase in Knowledge,—appear with a just <HI>Decorum,</HI> upon the Stage of Life,—and comfortably settled in the World. But she knew, these were <HI>poor</HI> and <HI>precarious</HI> Advantages, insufficient to satisfy the <HI>boundless Appetites</HI> of an intelligent and immortal Spirit. To obtain for Herself, and Posterity, the Favour of an <HI>unchangeable</HI> GOD, and an Intrest in that <HI>everlasting Covenant, in all Things well ordered and sure,</HI> was the Height of her Ambition. If this was secured, she was perswaded they would be happy in <HI>Prosperity</HI> and <HI>Adversity,</HI>—in <HI>Sickness</HI> and <HI>Health,</HI>—in <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Death.</HI> Therefore, she instilled into their tender Minds, <HI>the good Knowledge of the Lord</HI>: And as they grew up to Years of Discretion, by the most gentle and <HI>attractive</HI> Methods of Perswasion, strove to engage them to dedicate their Youth, to the Service of God; and sedulously to avoid those <HI>Irregularities,</HI> by which the <HI>Morning</HI> of Life, is so frequently <HI>darkned</HI> and defiled.</P>
<P>SHE continued a Widow several Years; employing her Time, in Exercises of <HI>Devo∣tion</HI>—the necessary Cares, of her <HI>Family,</HI>—and the Offices of <HI>Friendship.</HI> Afterwards, she married <HI>Johns Campbell,</HI> <ABBR>Esq;</ABBR> a Gentleman.
<PB N="13" REF="006530_0019_10292F6F3B05B9D8"/>
of good Character, and in plentiful Cir∣cumstances: Who proved an <HI>affectionate</HI> Husband to <HI>Her,</HI> and an <HI>indulgent</HI> Father to her <HI>Children.</HI> He lived but a few Years after this Marriage; and died in a peaceful and honourable old Age.</P>
<P>AFTER a suitable Interval, she married <HI>Henry Lloyd,</HI> <ABBR>Esq;</ABBR> of the <HI>Manor</HI> of <HI>Queen's</HI><HI>Village,</HI> in the Province of NEW-YORK. With him she lived in uninterrupted Har∣mony and Friendship, upwards of twenty Years. She now entered upon a Scene of Life entirely <HI>new.</HI> Hitherto she had dwelt in a <HI>populous</HI> Town, among her Relations, and surrounded with a large and delightful Acquaintance. But upon her Marriage with Mr. <HI>Lloyd,</HI> she removed into a distant Pro∣vince, to the retired <HI>Solitudes</HI> of a rural Life. She accommodated herself to this <HI>Change</HI> of Circumstances, with great Propriety and De∣cency; and in the calm <HI>Retreat,</HI> enjoyed the Blessings of Peace and Plenty, and an Opportunity of improving, in those devout Exercises, which had always been the Joy and Solace of her Life. But tho' she was, in a great Measure, removed from the Society and Amusements of the World, yet, she did not fly its important and necessary Business.
<PB N="14" REF="006530_0020_10292F71B36C0060"/>
In her, Mr. <HI>Lloyd</HI> found an agreeable <HI>Com∣panion,</HI>—his <HI>Children,</HI> an affectionate <HI>Mo∣ther,</HI>—his <HI>Servants,</HI> an indulgent <HI>Mistress</HI>—, his <HI>Tenants,</HI> a kind and beneficent <HI>Friend</HI>; who <HI>rejoiced</HI> in their <HI>Prosperity,—sympathized</HI> with them, in their <HI>Sorrows,—relieved</HI> them, in their <HI>Wants,</HI>—and was never easy, but when performing fome charitable and benevo∣lent Action. She soon became acquainted with the <HI>Affairs</HI> of the <HI>Country,</HI> and engaged in them with Alacrity and Vigour. She ma∣naged a numerous Family, with the exactest <HI>Economy</HI>; and treated Mr. <HI>Lloyd</HI>'s Children with the same Tenderness and Affection, as if they had been her own.</P>
<P>So amiable a Conduct, must certainly highly, <HI>endear</HI> her, to all who were so happy as to be related to her. Accordingly, the Family, in which her Lot was now cast, showed her <HI>uncommon</HI> Respect; and were sensible, that in her, they received a <HI>great</HI> and <HI>extensive</HI> Blessing.</P>
<P>IN this solitary, but pleasant Retirement, she managed her Time in the most useful Manner; looking well to the Affairs of her Houshold, and spending her remaining Hours, in Prayer, Meditation, and other religious Exercises;</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="006530_0021_10292F7551A768C0"/><HI>DEATH,</HI> she kept continually in View; and so <HI>numbered her Days,</HI> as to prepare for that <HI>decisive Moment,</HI> on which is suspended an Eternity of Happiness or Misery. Her constant Concern, was to <HI>act</HI> her Part up∣on the <HI>Stage</HI> of Life, well; to the Accep∣tance of her Judge; and to <HI>finish her Course with Joy.</HI> She was naturally of a tender and delicate Constitution; but was favoured with an <HI>unusual</HI> Degree of Health, for a Woman of her advanced Years. For some Time before her Death, she perceived a <HI>Feebleness</HI> of Nature, gradually increasing upon her; and often said. <Q>The <HI>Lamp</HI> of Life is almost <HI>expired!</HI></Q>—but still main∣tained her Activity, and Sprightliness of Temper. She spoke of <HI>Death</HI> with an Air of Pleasure; and seemed to wait, with earnest, Desire, a peaceful Dismission to eternal Rest. The Day before she died, she was in good Health; and in the Evening, supped and conversed with her family and Friends, with her <HI>accustomed</HI> Chearfulness. She retired, and spent some Time in reading the Rev. Mr. <HI>Hervey</HI>'s Meditations; — a Book she greatly admired for its <HI>sublime</HI> Thoughts, <HI>elevated</HI> Piety, and <HI>splendid</HI> Diction. There is something so <HI>striking</HI> in some of the <HI>last</HI> Lines she read in that admirable Performance;
<PB N="16" REF="006530_0022_1028DCDCFB48A6A8"/>
and so surprizingly <HI>adapted</HI> to the Scenes of Providence, which were before her, that I cannot forbear transcribing them. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>O! how <HI>thin</HI> is the <HI>Partition</HI> between this World and another! How <HI>short</HI> the <HI>Transition</HI> from Time to Eternity! The Partition, nothing more than the Breath in our Nostrils; and the Transition may be made in the Twinkling of an Eye. The Eyes of that Sublime Being,—who sits upon the Circles of the Earth, and views all its Inhabitants with one comprehensive Glance,—even now behold many Tents in Affliction: Such Affliction, as over∣whelmed The <HI>Egyptians</HI> in that fatal Night, when the destroying Angel sheathed his Arrows in all the Pride of their Strength.—Some, sinking to the Floor from their <HI>easy Chair</HI>; and deaf even to the most piercing Shrieks of their distracted Relations.—Some, giving up the Ghost as they are reclined, in all alone, under the <HI>shady Arbour,</HI> to taste the Sweets of the flowery Scene.—Some, as they sail, associated with a <HI>Party</HI> of <HI>Pleasure,</HI> along the Silver Stream, while Wine and Music flow around: Some <HI>intercepted,</HI> as they are returning Home; and some <HI>interrupted,</HI> as they enter upon an important Negotiation.</Q></NOTE> She went to Bed, at her wonted Hour, without any <HI>apparent Symptoms</HI> of approaching Disorder; and soon fell into a calm Sleep. About two o'Clock, she awaked; and in a few Minutes, complained that she wanted Breath; and asked for a <HI>Dose</HI> of <HI>Elixir,</HI> which used to relieve her in her Faintness. It was ready at Hand, and brought immediately: She drank
<PB N="17" REF="006530_0023_10292F7A185E0980"/>
it down, and that Moment expired,—without a Groan or Struggle; <HI>Novenrber</HI> 10. 1749. Thus, she passed from the <HI>gentle Slumbers</HI> of Nature, to the <HI>final Sleep</HI> of Death:—At once, changed a dark and disordered World, for the transporting Abodes of Light and Joy;—without experiencing those melancholly Scenes of Sickness and Pain,—the usual <HI>Attendants</HI> of a dying Bed!</P>
<P>A SUDDEN <HI>Death</HI> is the Object of uni∣versal Dread. And certainly, nothing can be a more affecting Spectacle than to behold <HI>gay unthinking Creatures,</HI> removed in a Mo∣ment, from the <HI>tumultuous Hurries</HI> of the World, and the <HI>defiling Pleasure</HI> of Sin, to the <HI>enlightned Tribunal</HI> of God; where they must receive an <HI>irrevocable</HI> Sentence, accor∣ding to the <HI>Deeds done in the Body.</HI> With the <HI>fastest</HI> Reason, do the greatest Part of Mankind pray, <Q>From sudden Death, good Lord, deliver us;</Q> for t'hey waste their Days in a fatal Forgetfulnes of their latter End: And if the <HI>mortal summons</HI> surprizes them unawares, it surely finds them unprepared for the momentous Change. But to the <HI>humble,</HI> the <HI>watchful</HI> Christian, who stands with his <HI>Loins girt, and Lamp burning,</HI> the most sud∣den Death can be no Disadvantage:—The
<PB N="18" REF="006530_0024_10292F7D74CD9FB8"/>
sooner the <HI>inevitable Arrest</HI> is executed, the easier his <HI>Passage</HI> to the Regions of unmo∣lested Repose.</P>
<P>WHAT can be more desirable, than to be removed at once, from the <HI>fading</HI> Comforts of Earth, to the <HI>unwithering</HI> Joys of Hea∣ven!—One Hour, prostrate at the <HI>Footstool</HI> of <HI>Grace</HI>; groaning under a body of Sin and Death;—the next, standing before the <HI>Throne</HI> of <HI>God</HI>; adorned with the shining Glories of complete Salvation!—One Moment in the Bosom of our <HI>earthly Friends</HI>;—the next, united to the <HI>blissful Society</HI> of <HI>Angels,</HI> and the <HI>general Assembly</HI> of <HI>the Spirits of just Men made perfect</HI>!—Glorious Transition!—not to be <HI>deplored</HI> as a <HI>Misfortune</HI>; but <HI>congratulated</HI> as a distinguishing <HI>Happiness</HI>!—When we have finished our appointed Time upon Earth, and we are ready for a Removal to an everlasting Habitation, it is a Favour to be delivered from the <HI>common Agonies</HI> of dissolving Nature, and excused the sad <HI>Solemnity</HI> of bidding Adieu to out Acquain∣tance and Friends.</P>
<P>BESIDES what may be learned of Mrs. <HI>Lloyd</HI>'s Character, from the proceeding Ac∣count; Justice to her <HI>uncommon Merit</HI>; and
<PB N="19" REF="006530_0025_10292F7EF8E458A8"/>
a Regard to the <HI>Edification</HI> of Survivors, demand that I enlarge a little farther, on those various Excellencies, which rendered her so <HI>useful</HI> in Life, and so much <HI>lamented</HI> at Death.</P>
<P>HER <HI>Aspect</HI> way lovely, serene and pleasant. She spoke in a graceful Manner, in soft and flowing Language. The Politeness of her Address, the Vivacity of her Conversatiorn, joined to the Benevolence of her Disposition, captivated all Companies; and made Persons of every Rank, fond of cultivating her Ac∣quantance.</P>
<P>HER <HI>intellectual Faculties</HI> were vastly be∣yond the common Level: A penetrating Understanding; a sprightly Fancy; a te∣nacious Memory; a clear and happy Ex∣pression, raised her above the greatest Part of the Sex; more than any of those <HI>glittering Distinctions,</HI> upon which they are apt inor∣dinately to doat.</P>
<P>But, Mrs. <HI>Lloyd</HI> was sensible that the Charms of Wit and Beauty, if not improved in the Service of Heaven, only render Per∣sons more exquisitely base and miserable. It was therefore her most solicitous Care, to have her Breast <HI>animated</HI> with the Love and
<PB N="20" REF="006530_0026_10292F81788A3670"/>
Fear of God; and her Life <HI>governed</HI> by the Precepts of Religion. And perhaps, few ever acted more <HI>uniformly</HI> under is influence, than the Person we are speaking of. She thought, spoke, and lived, as One that <HI>set the Lord always before</HI> her, and retained an abiding Sense of his Love. She began the Day with God, and rose early that she might have a calm <HI>uninterrupted</HI> Opportunity for the Offices of Devotion. No <HI>Hurry</HI> of Bu∣siness,—no <HI>Diversion</HI> of Company,—no <HI>Avo∣cation</HI> of Life, were suffered to exclude her <HI>stated Hours</HI> of Meditation and Prayer: These, she attended, not as an appointed' <HI>Task</HI> imposed upon her; but always returned to them, with Eagerness, as the most <HI>refreshi∣ing</HI> and <HI>honourble</HI> Employment. How she improved her Time, is fully known only by HIM to whom those sacred Hours were consecrated. Her private <HI>Manuscripts</HI> plainly show, they were spent in the most pious and profitable Manner;—adoring the AUTHOR, of her Being,—resigning herself afresh to the SAVIOUR of Mankind,—meditating on di∣vine Subjects,—strengthening her Resolutions to live to God, and the Designs of his Glo∣ry,—and earnestly imploring the almighty Aids of the Spirit; without which she was sensible, she could do nothing <HI>spiritually</HI> good.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="006530_0027_10292F861B58D2F0"/>HER Piety was not confined to the <HI>Closet,</HI> but directed, animated and supported her, thro' all the <HI>business</HI> of the Day. To obey the <HI>Comamds</HI> of her Maker,—to submit to the <HI>unerring Disposals</HI> of Heaven,—to maintain a happy <HI>Serenity</HI> of <HI>Mind,</HI> amidst the various Vicissitudes of Life,—to resist the <HI>Terrors</HI> and <HI>Allurements</HI> of an ensharing World,—was her constant unremitted Endeavour:</P>
<P>SHE <HI>read</HI> much;—but had not <HI>Taste</HI> for any Thing, but what had an evident Ten∣dency to make Mankind <HI>wiser</HI> or <HI>better.</HI> Books of <HI>meer Amusement,</HI> she seldom cared to meddle with, esteeming Time too precious, to be trisled away is Vanity. Treatises of <HI>practical Divinity,</HI>she read with a <HI>peculiar</HI> Relish. Those Writings, which were best calculated to inspire her with a <HI>humble Sense</HI> of the Vileness and Corruption of Human Nature; and give her <HI>exalted Views</HI> of the wonderful Love of God, in the mysterious Work of Redemption,—were what, she <HI>principally</HI> valued and studied. But above all, the BOOK of GOD, was that in which she took the greatest Delight. This she made here her constant, <HI>Friend</HI> and <HI>Cousellor,</HI>—the <HI>Guide</HI> of her Youth,—the <HI>Companion</HI> of
<PB N="22" REF="006530_0028_10292F88F97CE370"/>
her Solitude,—and the <HI>Support</HI> of her de∣clining Age. She read the sacred Pages, and other religious Tracts, not so much to encrease her <HI>speculative Knowledge,</HI> and gra∣tify the Inclinations of an <HI>inquisitive Mind</HI>; as to learn the self-denying Mysteries of the Cross of CHRIST,—<HI>detach</HI> her Affections from the <HI>Creature,</HI> and <HI>unite</HI> them more vigorously to the ORIGINAL SOURCE of Per∣fection and Blessedness.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Lord's Day</HI> was indeed to her, an holy <HI>Sabbath</HI> of <HI>Rest</HI>; entirely <HI>consecrated</HI> to the Exercises of Piety, Devotion, and Charity. She retired from the unnecessary Affairs of Life; and took Care that her <HI>Domestics</HI> might not be encumbered with Business, but have Leisure to pay their Ho∣mage to that BEING, whom <HI>all Ranks</HI> of Men are <HI>equally</HI> bound to adore and obey. No <HI>trifling</HI> Disourse,—no <HI>unprofitable,</HI> Amusements were permitted in her Presence. A chearful and composed <HI>Gravity,</HI>—a pro∣found <HI>Silence</HI> and <HI>Solemnity,</HI> appeared in all her Conduct, on the <HI>Christian Sabbath</HI>; except she found a convenient Occasion, to introduce a <HI>Conversation</HI> upon religious Sub∣jects, for the Instruction and Edification of the Company. Those <HI>sacred Hours</HI> were
<PB N="23" REF="006530_0029_10292F8A82A68338"/>
employed, as a delightful Preparation for that ETERNAL SABBATH, <HI>which remains for the People of</HI> GOD, in a future World. She <HI>naturalized</HI> herself, before hand, to the Duties and Exercises, the Manners and Customs of the heavenly State.</P>
<P>WHILE she lived in BOSTON, no flight Indisposition,—no Inclemencies of Wea∣ther, detained her from the <HI>Assemblies</HI> of the <HI>Saints.</HI> And after her Removal into the Country, tho' the <HI>Place</HI> of <HI>Workship</HI> was several Miles distant from her Abode, she gave her constant Attendance, unless the Weather was so tempestuous, as evidently to endanger her Health, and those who waited upon her. How she behaved in the <HI>Temple</HI> of God, was visible to Multitude, who were at once <HI>reproved</HI> and <HI>edified</HI> by her humble and reverent <HI>Example.</HI> There was nothing careless and negligent, or formal and affected in her Behaviour, during divine Service. She joined in the <HI>publick Prayers</HI> with Fervency and Devotion; and attended to the <HI>pious Instractions,</HI> deliver'd from the Pulpit, with the closest Appication. 'Throughout the whole Solemnity, she was all <HI>Ear</HI>!—all Attentions! Her Eyes were fix'd, and Heart intent upon the important
<PB N="24" REF="006530_0030_10292F8D55573608"/>
Transaction. A <HI>careless</HI> Look,—an <HI>inat∣tentive</HI> the Negligence,—<HI>a ceremonious</HI> Com∣plaisance; she esteemed the <HI>highest Absurdity</HI>; when appearing in the more <HI>immediate</HI> Pre∣sence of our Maker, and hearing <HI>the Words of eternal Life.</HI></P>
<P>SHE was a constant <HI>Communicant</HI> from her Youth; and expressed the highest Veneration for that <HI>solemn Institution,</HI> which our blessed Lord recommended to his Church with his dying Breath. She received the confecrated Elements, with an ardent Desire after that <HI>Bread</HI> of <HI>Life,</HI> by which alone, our Souls can be preserved in spiritual Health and Vigour. The lively <HI>Image</HI> of a crucified <HI>Savour,</HI> and the astonishing <HI>Wonders</HI> of his <HI>Love</HI> to apostate Sinners, exhibited in that Ordinance, made the most <HI>affectionate</HI> Im∣pressions upon her Heart; and often filled her with Transports of <HI>grateful</HI> Joy.</P>
<P>But tho' Mrs. <HI>Lloyd</HI> appropriated much of her Time to <HI>Devotion</HI> and <HI>Retirement,</HI> yet she made this no Excuse, to exempt her from the <HI>common Duties</HI> of Life. She <HI>descended from the Mount,</HI> with a serene Composure, and chearful Disposition, to engage in every necessary Employment
<PB N="25" REF="006530_0031_10292F8F26230020"/>
<HI>Idleness,</HI> she accounted <HI>peculiarly</HI> criminal in those, whom GOD has <HI>distinguish'd</HI> with a larger Share, than common, of the Gifts of Nature and Providence. The Business of every Day was prosecuted in its <HI>proper Season</HI> with a <HI>Liveliness</HI> and <HI>Vigour,</HI> that animated and encouraged all around her. She thought it no Burden, but <HI>Privilege,</HI> to fill up every <HI>vacant</HI> Space, with something that mighty be <HI>improving</HI> to herself, or <HI>instructive</HI> to others. Her constant Appli∣plication to the Duties of Religion, created no <HI>Distance</HI> or <HI>Reserve</HI> in her Behaviours Her Conversation was easy, natural, and pleasant. She was <HI>chearful</HI> without <HI>Levity,—grave</HI> without <HI>Affectation</HI>—condescending to the <HI>meanest,</HI>—obliging and helpful to ALL.</P>
<P>IT has been objected to Persons <HI>eminent</HI> in Religion, that they are apt to be <HI>severe</HI> in their Censures; and take an <HI>ill-natur'd Pride</HI> in reflecting upon the Conduct of others. This, whenever it appears, is a <HI>great Blemish</HI> to Religion; and an unfailing Evidence, that the Persons to whom it is justly imputed, have made but a <HI>superficial</HI> Progress in the Christian Life, and are under the <HI>predominant</HI> Influence of a proud self-righteous Spirit.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="006530_0032_10292F932C758FB0"/>Mrs. LLOYD was <HI>remarkably</HI> distant from any Thing of this Nature. She knew the Christian Doctrine was designed, not only to <HI>enkindle</HI> in our Breasts, a <HI>sacred Flame</HI> of <HI>Love</HI> to God; but to <HI>inspire</HI> us, with Sentiments of <HI>universal Benevolence</HI> to Mankind. The Sanctity of her Life, was adorned with the <HI>tenderest</HI> Condescention to the Weakness and Infirmities of others: She <HI>enlarged,</HI> with Pleasure, upon their <HI>Vertues</HI>; and made the <HI>handsomest Apologies</HI> for their unguarded <HI>Follies.</HI> Nothing but <HI>abandon'd</HI> Vice could provoke her to speak with <HI>Severity</HI>; and thro' an <HI>Excess</HI> of Charity would fain discover some∣thing <HI>praise-worthy</HI> even in the <HI>worst</HI> of Cha∣racters: An <HI>Air</HI> of <HI>Displeasure</HI> appeared in her Countenance, whenever an ill-natur'd or envious <HI>Reflection</HI> was made in her Presence. With all the <HI>Warmth</HI> of <HI>Friendship,</HI> she de∣fended the <HI>absent,</HI> tho' perhaps a distant Stranger. To sport with the Reputation of our Neighbour,—to expose and aggravate his Faults, she esteem'd the most <HI>ungenerous</HI> Conduct;—not only a direct Opposition to the <HI>Precepts</HI> of the <HI>Gospel</HI>; but a plain Violation of the <HI>Laws</HI> of <HI>civil Society.</HI> When Scandal and Detraction were the Subject of Conversation, where she was obliged to be present; she always testified her Displeasure;
<PB N="27" REF="006530_0033_10292F9629C9C4E8"/>
either with an <HI>open Rebuke,</HI> or, where this was improper, with a melancholly and <HI>for∣bidding Silence.</HI></P>
<P>HER <HI>superior</HI> Knowledge,—<HI>communicative</HI> Disposition,—and <HI>constant</HI> Good-Nature, made her Conversation highly agreeable. She talked upon every innocent and useful Subject with great Sprightliness and Freedom; but could never bear a <HI>prophane</HI> Jest, or <HI>malicious</HI> Satire, tho' cloathed in the <HI>fairest</HI> Dress, and adorned with the Charms of Wit and Polite∣ness.</P>
<P>RELIGION was her <HI>favourite Topic,</HI> which she introduced upon every proper Occasion, and endeavored to set in an <HI>amiable</HI> Lights, in order to recommend it, to the Esteem and Affection of all her Acquaintance. She had a deep Sense of the <HI>Baseness</HI> and <HI>Misery,</HI> that attend a <HI>vicious State</HI>; and was earnestly de∣sirous to rescue all, to whom she had Access, from its uneasy and <HI>disgraceful</HI> Bondage. She spoke in the most elevated Language of the <HI>Glories</HI> of <HI>redeeming</HI> Grace; and recommen∣ded an ALL-SUFFICIENT SAVIOURS, with all the Beauties of Perswasion and Eloquence. None came into her Company, but she en∣deavoured to inspire them with a <HI>Detestation</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="006530_0034_10292F97AB669C68"/>
of <HI>Vice,</HI> and assist them in the <HI>Practice</HI> of the sublimest Degrees of <HI>Piety: Out of the good Treasure of</HI> her <HI>Heart,</HI> she <HI>brought forth Things new and old,</HI> for their Instruction and Enter∣tainment. She was attended to with uncom∣mon Delight; and few left her Company, without sensible <HI>Regret.</HI> She possessed in Perfection the happy Art of turning the Con∣versation, from Things of a <HI>trisling</HI> and <HI>in∣different</HI> Nature, to those that were <HI>important</HI> and <HI>profitable.</HI> She easily ascended from the <HI>Earth</HI> to <HI>Hevaven</HI>—from the <HI>Flowers</HI> of the <HI>Field,</HI> to the <HI>Beauties</HI> of <HI>Paradise,</HI>—from the <HI>common Transactions</HI> of Life, to the <HI>momentous Affairs</HI> of Eternity:—From the daily Occur∣rences of Providence, she formed insructive Lessons of Prudence and Piety.</P>
<P>SHE had no Taste for those <HI>Diversions,</HI> in which the fashionable and polite Part of Mankind too often spend the most valuable Part of their Time. In the Exercises of De∣votion, she found a <HI>perpetual Spring</HI> of su∣blime and satisfying Pleasures, and the no∣blest <HI>Support</HI> under the <HI>unavoidable</HI> Trials and Afflictions of Life. A firm Perswasion of the everlasting <HI>Love</HI> of <HI>God,</HI>—an unshaken Trust in the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of our almighty Saviour,—the Testimony of a <HI>good Conscience</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="006530_0035_10292F9B41B685B8"/>
—and a joyful Expectation of <HI>heavely Happiness,</HI> inclined her to look down with a generous <HI>Disdain</HI> on all he assuring Vanities of the World; and to aspire after Nothing but the highest Degrees of Preparation for the <HI>Inheritance of the Saints in Light.</HI></P>
<P>THO' she was naturally of a <HI>warm</HI> and <HI>lively</HI> Temper; yet she kept her <HI>Passions</HI> under the most absolute Command, and was always serene, composed, and chearful. Those displeasing Accidents, which often raise a <HI>sudden Tempest</HI> of Anger, even in the Breast of good Men, hardly ever <HI>ruffled</HI> the <HI>Tranquility</HI> of her Mind. Upon the greatest <HI>personal</HI> Provocations, she never allowed an <HI>indecent</HI> Word; nor betrayed an <HI>unjustifiable</HI> Resentment. If ever she expressed herself with Warmth and Vehemence, it was in the Cause of Heaven and flow'd from a <HI>com∣mendable</HI> Zeal against Opinions and Practices, which she thought <HI>destructive</HI> to pure and undefiled Religion.</P>
<P>NOT that she was inflamed with a bitter Spirit, aginst Persons of <HI>different</HI> Sentiments in Religion. She loved good Men of all Perswasions; and reverenced real Religion, in whatsoever Communication she found it. All
<PB N="30" REF="006530_0036_10292F9DABC69AA0"/>
who were animated with the <HI>Love of God,</HI>—maintain'd the <HI>essential Truths</HI> of Christianity and adorned their Profession by an <HI>holy Conver∣sation,</HI> she embraced with a cordial Respect, without Regard to <HI>Party</HI>-Names, or Di∣stinctions.</P>
<P>SHE was a warm Advocate for what are generally stiled the <HI>Doctrines</HI> of <HI>Grace.</HI> She was firmly perswaded, they had the greatest Tendency, to exalt the Glory of God; and afforded the highest Encouragement to pe∣rishing apostate Sinners; and were upon all Accounts calculated to promote the Com∣fort and Holiness of the <HI>Church</HI> of Christ, She therefore openly appeared in their Favour, and defended them when misrepresented and opposed by Persons of a different Way of thinking. But she had too deep a Sense of the <HI>Weakness</HI> of human Nature, and the Strength of the <HI>Prejudices</HI> of Education, rashly to pronounce an Anathema meerly on the Account of a <HI>Diversity</HI> of Opinion, in these mysterious Points. Her Zeal against <HI>Error</HI> was accompanied with a Tenderness to the <HI>Erroneous.</HI> She treated their Persons, with Kindness and Condescension; and pray∣ed that they might be <HI>brought to the Acknow∣ledgment of the Truth</HI>!</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="006530_0037_10292FA104B2B2A0"/>CHARITY was her darling Vertue, which she exercised. with peculiar Delight and Satis∣faction; and desired as she had Opportunity, <HI>to do good unto all Men.</HI> Her benevolent Spirit was not <HI>circumscribed</HI> within the Bounds of any divided Communion; but <HI>extended</HI> to all Mankind, without Distinction of, Parties. It seemed her <HI>uninterrupted Study,</HI> to perform generous and beneficent Actions to all, within the Circle of her Acquaintance,—even beyond her Ability. She knew no other Use of <HI>Money,</HI> but to assist her Friends in their Difficulties, and relieve the Poor in their Indigence. She was always <HI>uneasy,</HI> if any left her House, without receiving some <HI>valuable</HI> Token of her Kindness. To do obliging Things, was the <HI>genuine Propensity</HI> of her Soul, and one of the most <HI>refin'd Pleasures</HI> of her Life. The Value of the Gift, was <HI>heightned</HI> by the kind <HI>engaging</HI> Manner in which it was conferr'd. Her Generosity was never <HI>extorted</HI> by <HI>Importunity,</HI> nor <HI>dispensed</HI> with <HI>Regret.</HI> Misery and Want always excited her compassionate Regard; and engaged her to use her <HI>utmost Efforts</HI> to remove them. She joyfully em∣braced every Opportunity to <HI>diffuse</HI> Happiness to all around her; and in the Peace and Sa∣tisfaction of her Mind, experienced the Truth
<PB N="32" REF="006530_0038_10292FA2861A87D0"/>
of that <HI>Maxim</HI> of our Blessed Lord, <HI>It is more blessed to</HI> give <HI>than to</HI> receive. She condescended to the <HI>lowest Offices,</HI> that she might do good to Mankind; visited the Poor in their Sickness; provided for their Support; and by her wise religious <HI>Counsels</HI> assisted them to make a suitable Improvement of their Affliction.</P>
<P>NO Wonder such <HI>Assemblage</HI> of <HI>Vertues,</HI> so many lovely Qualities, rendered her the Delight of her Fiends; and overwhelmed them with Grief, at her sudden and unex∣pected Removal. Tho' she had passed the Threshold of Old Age; yet the <HI>Regularity</HI> of her Conduct, her <HI>exact Temperance</HI> in Diet, and the <HI>Vivacity,</HI> of her Temper, which continued to the last; encouraged us to hope for a much longer Enjoyment of so valuable a Life.</P>
<P>I AM, sensible, than in this Account to do Justice to her Memory, I have fallen much short of what her <HI>extraordinary</HI> Merit deserves. Her Friends will be able to add many <HI>beautiful Particulars,</HI> to those here enumerated. I have given a faint, but <HI>true Resemblance</HI> of her Character and Conduct; tho' not with that Life and Propriety, which the Excellency
<PB N="33" REF="006530_0039_10292FA50A1E7FF8"/>
of my Subject requires. We value the <HI>Pourtrait</HI> of a departed Friend, if <HI>like</HI> the Original, tho' not drawn by the most <HI>skillful</HI> Hand.</P>
<P>I SHALL only add a few Words relating to the following <HI>Papers.</HI> They were all written for her own <HI>private</HI> Use; and undoubtedly never designed for <HI>public</HI> View. But when upon her lamented Death, they fell into my Hands, I thought them <HI>too valuable</HI> a Trea∣sure to be <HI>concealed</HI> from the World. I have therefore selected, such of her Manuscripts, as I imagined, might be of <HI>most general</HI> Use; and am perswaded they will afford Instruction and Delight to a serious and devout Mind.</P>
<P>THE Reader must not expect any <HI>labour'd</HI> Criticisms, <HI>deep</HI> Reasonings, or <HI>rhetorical</HI> Flourishes. It cannot be expected, that a Gentlewoman, who was daily busied in the Cares of a numerous Family, could be ac∣quainted with <HI>scholastic</HI> Niceties, and the <HI>mo∣dern Refinments</HI> of Method and Stile. The following Collection speaks the <HI>undisguised</HI> Language of her Heart. She talks of divine Things, in that familiar and affecting Manner, in which they appeared to her, in her devout, Retirements. They contain some of the secret

Transactions between God, and her own Soul, when she was more solicitous to <HI>regulate</HI> the <HI>Disposition</HI> of her Mind, than to <HI>model</HI> her <HI>Thoughts</HI> according to the Rules of Art, and express them in the Beauties of Diction. But I am perswaded, they contain such <HI>sublime Sentiments</HI> of Piety; such a <HI>sared Fervour</HI> of Devotion; that the indulgent Reader will easily excuse any <HI>slight</HI> Inaccuracies, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> critical Eye may observe.</P>

<P><HI>Upon the</HI> TRUTH <HI>of the</HI> CHRISTIAN RELIGION; <HI>and, an Enquiry into the State of my own Soul.</HI></P>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG> MY ever glorious and gracious God, and heavenly Father in Jesus Christ! I read in the sacred Oracles of Truth, that Thou didst <HI>so love the World, as to give thine only begotten Son, that who∣soever believeth in him, should not perish, but have everlasting Life</HI>;—and that <HI>this Life is in thy Son</HI>—Thou hast also borne Testimony, that JESUS <HI>is</HI> thy <HI>beloved Son, in whom</HI> thou
<PB N="36" REF="006530_0042_10292FAC4D6C33F8"/>
art <HI>well pleased</HI>;—that those who <HI>believe thy Testimony have set to their Seal, that God is true;—but they that believe not, have made God a Liar.</HI> I therefore importunately pray, That thou wouldest bestow on me, <HI>that Faith by which the Just do live</HI>; and all those divine and heavenly Qualifications, which are the certain <HI>Consequence,</HI> and best <HI>Evidence,</HI> of my Union to the Lord Jesus Christ; in <HI>whom all the Promises are Yea and Amen.</HI></P>
<P>All this, and whatsoever else, is requisite to my present and future Happiness, must proceed from thee, <HI>who art the Author and Finisher of our Faith.</HI>—For thou hast decla∣red, <HI>That none can come to the Son, but those whom the Father draws: And none can know the Father, but those to whom the Son doth reveal him.</HI> I desire therefore, in the Name and Strength, of my glorious and exalted Advocate and Redeemer, humbly to plead with Faith and Fervency, for the efficacious and all-conquering Drawings of thy holy Holy Spirit; that I may indeed obtain a saving Knowledge, <HI>of the thee, the living and true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.</HI></P>
<P>O MY GOD! wilt thou be graciously plea∣sed for Christ's Sake, <HI>to send forth thy Light
<PB N="37" REF="006530_0043_10292FAEF0D18348"/>
and thy Truth, to lead me into all Truth,</HI> and enable me, at this Time, to make a faithful and sincere Enquiry, whether my Faith be true and saving? whether indeed <HI>Christ is formed in me</HI>? May I be enable now, and at all Times, so to <HI>believe</HI> and <HI>practice,</HI> as my tend most for thy Glory and the Salvation of my own Soul. May I never think, speak, or write, any Thing, but what I receive from thee, and is agreeable to thy holy Will.</P>
<P>I DESIRE to have my whole Dependance upon thy glorious Majesty, to enable me always to see divine Truths in a proper Light, and <HI>to work within me the whole good Pleasure of thy Grace, and the Work of Faith with Power.</HI> All this, and whatever else is needful for me and mine, and the whole Israel of God, I humbly beg for Christ's Sake:—To whom, with thy glorious Majesty, and the blessed Spirit of Grace, the Comforter, be rendered, the Kingdom, Power, Glory and Thanks∣giving, now and evermore, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>AND now having look'd up to Heaven, for divine Illumination; I will set about this important Enquiry, <HI>viz.</HI> What is the <HI>Fou∣dation</HI> of my Faith?—whether I have indeed Felt the <HI>transforming</HI> Power of this Faith, and
<PB N="38" REF="006530_0044_10292FB075220530"/>
consequently whether I am by divine Grace; <HI>united</HI> unto Jesus Christ the Second <HI>Adam</HI>; by Virtue of which Union alone, I can live spiritually and eternally. An <HI>historical</HI> Faith, which is only conveyed to me by my Reason and Understanding, I know is not sufficient; <HI>for the Devils believe and tremble,</HI>—My En∣quiry then must be, what is a <HI>true</HI> and <HI>saving</HI> Faith; and whether I have been made the happy Subject of this Faith. An historical and rational Faith, is indeed requisite as a <HI>Means,</HI> in order to the obtaining a saving Faith: For I read, <HI>that Faith comes by hearing;—how can we believe on him of whom we have not heard</HI>? I will therefore first examine, how far my <HI>Reason</HI> will assist me in this important Enquiry.</P>
<P>EVERY one <HI>that cometh unto God, must be∣lieve, that be is, and that be is the Rewarder of those that diligently seek him.</HI> That there is a God, a Supreme Being, the great Creator, and Lord Proprietor of all Things, not only the Light of Nature, and the Dictates of Reason, but my very <HI>Senses,</HI> inform me. For <HI>the invisible Things of him from the Creation of the World are clearly seen; being understood by the Things that are made, even his eternal Power and Godhead.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="006530_0045_10292FB576DDE9E8"/>I CANNOT turn my Eyes any where, from the <HI>strarry Regions,</HI> and those glorious and magnificent. <HI>Luminaries,</HI> which adorn the Firmament above, to the <HI>lowest Shrub,</HI> or <HI>Spire</HI> of <HI>Grass,</HI> that grows upon the Face of the Ground; from the great <HI>Leviathan</HI> to the most insignificant <HI>Insect</HI>; but I must read in∣delible Characters, of an all-wise and power∣ful Creator!</P>
<P>WHEN I consider the exquisite Formation and Beauty of the <HI>human Body,</HI> I am filled with Admiration and Surprize;—but when I contemplate the more noble Part of our Frame, the <HI>intellectual Faculties</HI> of the immortal Soul, my Astonishment encreases:—I have the most <HI>ungainsayable</HI> Assurance, that both Body and Soul are of a <HI>divine</HI> Original.—Thus far my Reason confirms my Faith, with Respect to the Existence of a SUPREME BEING.</P>
<P>BUT as to my <HI>Faith</HI> in the Lord JESUS CHRIST, the great Saviour of the Worlds, and all the <HI>sublime</HI> and mysterious Doctrines, contained in the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion, I want the Assistance of <HI>Revelation:—Great is the Mystery of Godliness, God manifest in the Flesh.</HI>—We know these divine Truths, only because God has discovered them unto us.
<PB N="40" REF="006530_0046_10292FB826E96148"/>
But that the <HI>Book,</HI> in Which I find all these glorious Doctrines so plainly and strongly asserted, is a <HI>Revelation</HI> from Heaven, my <HI>Reason</HI> very much assists me in the Belief of: So that the great Apostle of the Gentiles, with much Justice and Propriety, ranks Unbe∣lievers with <HI>unreasonable Men.</HI> For altho' the sublime Misteries of the Gospel, are in themselves so infinitely beyond the <HI>Ken</HI> of human Reason; nor could ever be discovered by the dim Light of Nature; yet they are so plainly and convincingly <HI>conveyed</HI> to us in the sacred <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and attended with so <HI>strong</HI> an Evidence of their divine Authority, as is sufficient to obtain the Belief of every reason∣nable and <HI>unprejudiced</HI> Person.</P>
<P>IN this blessed Book I find an Account of the <HI>Creation,</HI> which not only may <HI>Reason,</HI> but my very <HI>Senses,</HI> inform me is true. Here I read of the <HI>Fall</HI> of <HI>Man,</HI> which the <HI>dear∣bought Experience</HI> of every Day, assures me is Fact: <HI>How is our Gold become Dross,</HI> and our Beauty turn'd into loath some Defomity! Here I find a Promise of our <HI>Recovery,</HI> by <HI>the Seed of the Woman,</HI> who was appointed to <HI>bruise the Serpent's head.</HI> This <HI>Promise,</HI> my Reason tell me, must certainly be <HI>fulfilled</HI>; it being made by the true and <HI>unchangeable</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="006530_0047_10292FBA3845BF18"/>
GOD.—But <HI>how,</HI> or in <HI>what Manner,</HI> this Promise was to be accomplish'd, neither Men nor Angels dare so much as have guess'd,—without <HI>divine Revelation.</HI> But the sacred Oracles of Truth, inform me, <HI>that God so loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that all who believe in him, should not perish, but have Life ever∣lasting.</HI>—This I believe upon the Authority of the Word of God. That JESUS CHRIST is this invaluable Gift, I have the Testimony of the great God himself, who by an audible Voice from Heaven, declar'd <HI>him, his beloved Son, in whom he is well pleas'd.</HI>—Upon this <HI>single</HI> Evidence I may safely venture my ALL, for Time and Eternity. That <HI>this Voice</HI> was indeed from <HI>the excellent Glory,</HI> and no <HI>Imposition</HI> upon the Senses of those that heard, it, appears in that the glorious God was pleas'd, to <HI>confirm</HI> the Misson of Christ, by the highest Evidence that can be,—his <HI>Resurrection</HI> from the Dead; which could be effected by no Power short of the <HI>Almighty</HI> Creator of all Things.</P>
<P>THIS, I think, is the strongest Demon∣stration of the <HI>Truth</HI> of all that Christ deli∣livered: For it cannot be supposed, that the Fountain of all possible Perfection would <HI>au∣thorise</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="006530_0048_10292FBCD3293A48"/>
a <HI>Fraud.</HI> The Facts which relate to our blessed Saviour, as they are recorded in the Gospel, are confirm'd by <HI>contemporary Writers,</HI> and exactly harmonize with the <HI>Predictions,</HI> concerning this divine Person, which are con∣tain'd in the ancient <HI>Prophets.</HI></P>
<P>As to the moral Precepts of the Christian Religion, I am well assured, that had PLATO, SENECA, and all the Masters of Reason of the Heathen World, seen that glorious <HI>Body</HI> of <HI>Laws</HI>; those excellent Precepts contain'd in our Saviour's Sermon upon the Mount, they would have said, that their Author was <HI>divine,</HI> and these Writings inspired.</P>
<P>THUS the great and glorious God, is pleas'd to deal with us as <HI>reasonable Creatures</HI>; and by Means and Instruments, conveys to us spiritual Truth: But after all, the sublime Mysteries of the Gospel, cannot be savingly comprehended, in this Way alone: The Line of Reason is too short, to teach those unfa∣thomable Depths, <HI>which Angels themselves de∣sire to look into.</HI> It is the mighty Power of God which produces in us that Faith, <HI>which is unto Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>I ACKNOWLEDGE it is beyond all Expres∣sion, the greatest Blessing of my Life, that
<PB N="43" REF="006530_0049_10292FC103955BC0"/>
in the Course of my Education, I was fa∣voured with the Holy Scriptures in my <HI>own Language</HI>; and have always enjoy'd the Means of Grace to help me in my Christian Race:—But if God had not, of his infinite Grace, sent forth a <HI>divine Ray</HI> of Light and Life, to enable me to receive JESUS, with my whole Soul, in all his Offices, for all his Benefits,—<HI>Wisdom, Righteousnes, Sanctification, and enternal Redemption</HI>; it is most certain, that the highest Degrees of <HI>speculative</HI> Knowledge, and all the <HI>extenal.</HI> Means of Grace, would have proved <HI>ineffec∣tual</HI> to my Salvation.—It is the Work of God to encline me to believe in Christ. No Power short of the which created the World at first, <HI>could create me anew in Christ Jesus</HI>;—and nothing short of a new Creation, will prove effectual to my Salvation. It is a transforming Act of Faith that unites us to Christ, and gives a Title to that precious Pro∣mise, <HI>Because I live, ye shall live also.</HI></P>
<P>BLESSED be God! I have an humble Hope thro' the boundless Riches of free Grace, that this Promise is fulfill'd in me, and that I have the highest and strongest Evidence of the <HI>Truth</HI> of the Christian Religion by the <HI>Wit∣of the Spirit!</HI>—Not by an <HI>unreasonable

Impulse</HI> made upon my Mind, but the the <HI>transforming Efficacy</HI> which divine Truths have had upon my Soul.</P>
<P>I CAN testify from my own Experience, with what exalted Pleasure, the sincere and prayerful Christian reads the sacred Records. How doth the true Believer <HI>spell out</HI> the promised Messiah, in the <HI>Types, Figures,</HI> and <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> of the Old Testament Dispen∣sation!—How often do we read his Name, in brighter and <HI>more legible</HI> Characters, in the inspir'd <HI>Prophecies!</HI>—How beautifully do the two Testaments agree, in every Thing essential to our Salvation!—What we find recorded in the <HI>Prophecies</HI> of the <HI>Old,</HI> we read in the <HI>History</HI> of the <HI>New.</HI></P>
<P>How exact an <HI>Agreement</HI> is there between the renewed Nature, and the Precepts of the Gospel! Our great Teacher gives us a com∣prehensive <HI>Summary</HI> of the Moral Law, in those few Words: <HI>Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, with all thy Soul, and with all thy Strength, and thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self.</HI> By the Operation of the blessed Spirit, I am enabled to acquiesce in this Law; not only as my <HI>bounden Duty</HI> and most reasonable Service, but as my <HI>highest Happiness,</HI> and greatest Privilege.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="006530_0051_10292FC58ADCB360"/>How inexpressibly refreshing, have the Promise and Invitations of the Gospel, been to me, because of their exact <HI>Suitableness</HI> to my Wants! When God, by a Ray of divine Light, was pleased to discover, my wretched and miserable State by Nature and Practiced, how comfortable was it, to find the Invitations of Grace address'd to such a polluted, selflruined Creature, as I am!—I have nothing to plead in my own Behalf, but must hold up my Hand at the Bar of God, and cry out, GUILTY, GUILTY; <HI>for in thy Sight can no Flesh living be justified</HI> upon their own Ac∣count. But blessed be thy glorious Majesty! Thou hast <HI>proclaim'd thy Name, the Lord gracious and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, forgiving Iniquity, Transgression, and Sin</HI>: Therefore I am en∣couraged to pray, <HI>Pardon my Iniquity, for it is very great;—Heal my Soul, for I have sinned against thee.</HI></P>
<P>How free and universal is the Gospel Call! <HI>Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the Waters, and be that that no Money, come buy and eat, &amp;c.</HI> And I have an humble Hope, thro' the Riches of Free Grace in CHRIST JESUS, that I have heard the Voice of GOD speaking to me in these Invitations; and been enabled by the promis'd Spirit to obey
<PB N="46" REF="006530_0052_10292FC8F2F15608"/>
the heavenly Call, with an earnest Thirst after the Blessings of the <HI>new and well∣ordered Convenant</HI>;—the dear bought Purchase of the Redeemer's Blood;—and to receive JESUS CHRIST in all his Offices,—to live upon him, as authorized by God the Father, <HI>to fulfill in his People the whole good Pleasure of his Will.</HI> And as I receives the first Breath of spiritual Life, from the inexhausti∣ble Fountain of Free Grace, so I have still my entire Dependance, upon the same un∣merited Assistance, For Time and Eternity.</P>
<P>THIS is my strong <HI>Anchor hold,</HI> my ssafe Retreat, my Light, my Life, my everlasting ALL IN ALL. When I look upon myself, I really find I am a poor, indigent, helpless Creature, surrounded with numberless and powerful Enemies. In these deplorable Cir∣cumstances, I must inevitably sink down in utter Dispair, were it not for this divine Support, this omnipotent Arm; under whose Influence, every <HI>Strom</HI> of Temptation drives me to the <HI>Harbour,</HI> and every <HI>Onset</HI> of the Enemy, cause me to take faster hold of my victorious <HI>Leader.</HI>—In this Way the Soul is safe and happy in the most tempestuous Season.—That Soul cannot be lost, that is united to CHRIST, the living Head of his People.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="006530_0053_10292FCA744AA860"/>To such how pleasant and profitable are the <HI>Psalms</HI>! How often doth the humble Believer, read the Redeemer's, Name in many <HI>sublime</HI> Passages of that sacred Book, and rise up to God on <HI>David</HI>'s seraphic Wing!—How beautfu1 is the <HI>divine</HI> Morality con∣tain'd in the <HI>Proverbs</HI> of <HI>Solomon</HI>! Who can read them, and not blush for his many cri∣minal Violations, of those admirable In∣struction of Wisdom!—With what Pleasure and Advantage doth the Child of God, peruse the <HI>Song</HI> of <HI>Solomon</HI>; and find the Glories of redeeming Love in that mysterious Composure!

<P>WITH what humble Admiration does the true Believer meditate upon the <HI>sacred History</HI> of the Incarnation; Birth, Sufferings, Death and Resurrection of our BLESSED REDEEMER! How great a Tendency hath a realizing View of those, important Truths; to suppress the Fire of Anger, Hatred, Malice, and Revenge! How strongly doth it incline him to mortify every Sins, when he considers how dear it cost the SON of GOD, to make Attone∣ment for it; at what an infinite Expence he hath purchased our Deliverance from this vilest of Slavery,—and the Liberty and Privileges of the Children of God! How powerfully does it perswade us to take up every Cross, with Chearfulness and Resigna∣tion, when we remember, that in this Way we trace the divine Footsteps of our Saviour, and follow <HI>the great Captain of our Salvation who was made perfect thro' Sufferings</HI>! How irresistible does his <HI>dying</HI> Love engage us to

devote our selves to him, <HI>an holy, living, and acceptable Sacrifice!</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE an humble Hope, through the powerful Efficacy of divine Grace, that I have experienced the sanctifying Power of these Truths upon my own Soul. I find every <HI>Deviation</HI> from the pure and perfect Law of God, is inexpressibly more bitter to me, than the greatest Affliction. Every ear∣nest Aspiration of my Heart, is for greater Conformity to the divine Image and Will. It is my perpetual Prayer, that God would send down a more plentiful Effusion of the Blessed Spirit, into my Soul, and the Souls of my Children and Grand-Children, to the End of Time; that <HI>every high Thought,</HI> and towering Imagination, may be subdued <HI>to the Obedience of faith</HI>; and that every Thing contrary thereto, <HI>may be brought out and destroyed.</HI> That wee may indeed ,know and fear, love and serve, <HI>the living and true God, and</HI> Jesus Christ <HI>whom</HI> he has sent.</P>
<P>O! WHEN shall the Time be, that <HI>the Kingdoms of this World, shall become, the Kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Christ</HI>! When <HI>the Knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ shall cover the Earth, as the Waters do the Sea!</HI></P>

<P>I DESIRE to be deeply humbled before thee, O my GOD! for all my Sins original and actual; in every Stage Station, Relation and Circumstance of Life; in all I have sin∣ned, and fallen short of my Duty.

Mercies. How greatly have all the Faults, and Foliies of my Life been aggravated, since GOD was graciously pleased to shew me the Vanity and Emptiness of all <HI>sublunary</HI> Enjoy∣ments, and to lead me out to himself as my only satisfying Portion. O astonishing Mad∣ness! that after all this, my foolish fluctuating Heart, should be <HI>sipping</HI> at the <HI>Puddle-Streams</HI> of Creature Comforts, to the Neglect of the inexhausted <HI>Fountain</HI> of uncreated Goodness!

<P>How justly might thy glorious Majesty have punish'd this my Folly, with utter Desertion! but instead of this, thou hast not only strove with, but overcome my un∣grateful and stupid Heart; and enabled me to say with ardent Desire, <HI>As the Hart pan∣teth after the Water Brooks, so panteth my Soul after thee, my</HI> GOD.</P>

my most exalted Praise are so extreamly deficient; that <HI>shouldst thou mark the Iniquity</HI> of my best Performances, thou mightest justly <HI>cast them back, as Dung, in my Face,</HI> and spurn me out of thy favourable Presence.

If the Invitation had been address'd to good People, I should have had no Hope; for I have Nothing properly my own; but Sin and Misery: All my Confidence is plac'd in thy undeserved Mercy, and the Righteousness of thy dear Son. In Obedience to thy Command, I fly to the Blood of Jesus, for Pardon and Cleansing, for Health and Healing. Blessed be God, for Jesus Christ, the Fountain of all Grace, to an apostate World!—for the promised Spirit, the eternal Comforter of his Church!—for the Means of Grace, and the Hopes of Glory!

Way to preserve us from every hurtful and deadly Evil,—to obtain the Peace and Pleasure upon Earth, and Eternal Happiness in Heaven.</P>
<P>To prove this Proposition, I will first consider the meer <HI>moral Man,</HI> who has nothing else in View, but the Honour and Advantage of this Life.—This Man is strict∣ly <HI>just</HI> in his Dealings, <HI>generous</HI> to his Friend, <HI>charitable</HI> to the Poor, kind and <HI>beneficient</HI> to all, as far as his Circumstances will admit.—He is careful to hurt Body by Word or Deed; he walks is the straight Path of Truth and Integrity, in his Commerce with his Fellow Creatures; and governs himself by the Rules of moral Vertue, in all his <HI>ex∣ternal</HI> Conduct; in eating, drinking, sleeping, Recreation,<HI>&amp;c.</HI> observes the Laws of Sobriety and Temperance. That this Man has a just Claim to the Honour, Esteem and Affection, of all that converse with him; I suppose none will deny. O how many <HI>Advantages</HI> does he receive from his amiable Behaviors!</P>
<P>HIs kind and generous Disposition, natu∣rally and necessarily advaces his,Credit; and for ehe most part he: experiences the <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Benefit</HI> of those Texts,—<HI>He that watereth,

shall also be watered himself. There is that scattereth, and yet encreaseth. The liberal Soul deviseth liberal Things, and by liberal Things be stands.</HI> While the <HI>Miser</HI> is abhorr'd both by God and Man; and often feels the Force of those Words: <HI>There is that with-holdeth more than is meet, and it tendeth to Poverty.</HI></P>
<P>STRICT <HI>Justice</HI> in all our Transactions with Mankind, is the readiest Way to enlarge our Business, and by that Means to encrease our Estates; while the <HI>fradulent</HI> Dealer, is in the utmost Danger of being detected and ruin'd. A steady. Integrity in our whole Conduct, is upon all Accounts, most easy and honourable. <HI>Truth</HI> wants no Contrivance or Invention; but, like a perfect <HI>Beauty,</HI> looks best, at the nearest Approach:—It will bear the Test of the most critical Inquiry, and ever comes off with universal Applause. Even the most prostigate, have a secret <HI>Reverence</HI> for that, which they have not the <HI>Honesty</HI> to practise. Whereas the insincere and fallacious, when discovered, are the Objects of publick Con∣tempt, and avoided by all that know them.</P>
<P>THAT Temperance in eating, drinking; <HI>&amp;c.</HI> contribute to the Health of the Body, and the Strength and Brightness of the intellectual

And nothing can be more self-evident than, that a <HI>clear Head,</HI> and an <HI>healthy Body,</HI> is essential to the Comfort and Enjoyment of the present Life. The dear-bought Experience of the Licentious, shews, that <HI>Intemperance</HI> in its own Nature, hath a Tendency to break the firmest Const∣tution; and is attended with a melacholly Train of Sorrows and Diseases.</P>
<P>IF we consider those Vertues, which may be properly stiled Christian, <HI>viz.</HI>—Humility, Patience, Self-denial, and Forgiveness of In∣juries; these Vertues also carry their own Reward with them, by establishing the Mind in Tranquility and Peace: While Pride, Envy, Wrath, and Revenge, embitter the Spirits, corrode the Vitals, and devour every easy Thought.</P>
<P>I THINK then it is evident, beyond all Contradiction, that the Precepts of moral Vertue, with those additional Improvements, which are made to them by the Gospel of Christ, are to all Intents and purposes calcu∣lated to advance the Honour, Interest Peace
<PB N="59" REF="006530_0065_10292FEC0CF703F8"/>
and Pleasure of Mankind; so that every one that is under the Government of his Reason, would choose to live in the Practice of them, upon the Principles of <HI>Self-love,</HI> altho' he had no other Motive.</P>
<P>IT must be acknowledged, that these moral Vertues are truly excellent and lovely in them∣selves, and so essential to the Christian cha∣racter, that all Pretences to it, in a Neglect of these, is a fatal Delusion; and these vain Professors, must expect no other Sentence from the Mouth of their supreme Judge than that, <HI>Depart from me, I know you not, ye Workers of Iniquity.</HI></P>
<P>BUT when these Vertues proceed <HI>only</HI> from the Principles of <HI>Self-love,</HI> they are essentially defective. The true Christian,—the spiritual∣minded Man, is animated with nobler Motives and Designs. <HI>Love</HI> to God, the most per∣fect Being, and <HI>Faith</HI> in Christ, the Saviour of Mankind, are the vital Springs of his Obedience to the Laws of Heaven.</P>
<P>WHILE the meer moral Man is <HI>compassing himself about with Sparks of his own enkin∣dling,</HI> and satisfied with his own Goodness; the real Christian has been made to see, that he has nothing that he can properly call his
<PB N="60" REF="006530_0066_10292FEF1201AA38"/>
own, but Pollution and Deformity; and nothing to expect from God, upon his own Account, but Destruction and Misery. He is taught by the illuminating Influence of divine Grace, to renounce all Self-dependence, and wait at the Footstool of a sovereign GOD, for Deliverance from all the Wretchedness of the Apostacy. By this hie is prepared to receive the compassionate Offers of the Gos∣pel; and thankfully to commit himself into the Hands of an Almighty Saviour: And when once he is perswaded, <HI>by the Drawings of the Father, to come to Christ,</HI> as his living LORD and HEAD, to say in the Language of Appropriation, MY LORD, AND MY GOD then, and not till then, can he perform ac∣ceptable Obedience. For 'tis by Power de∣rived from the <HI>Life-giving</HI> JESUS, that we are enabled to do any Thing spiritually Good; and we remain his poor dependant Creatures to the End of Life.</P>
<P>How happy are the Effects that flow from an Union with him! The humble Soul finds Light, Life and Strength suf∣ficient to answer all his Wants; to triumph over all his Difficulties. Amidst all the all Darkness, Troubles and Temptations of this tempestuous Region, he has a safe Retreat,
<PB N="61" REF="006530_0067_10292FF3364376D8"/>
an unfailing Defence. The Soul finds a Rest in God, and tastes <HI>that Peace, which passes all Understanding.</HI> He finds by happy Experience, that <HI>Wisdom's Ways are Pleasant∣ness, and all her Paths Peace.</HI> That Pro∣mise of our blessed Saviour, is accomplished in his Behalf; <HI>He that loveth me, him will my Father honour.</HI> These are not vain <HI>Amusements,</HI> but substantial <HI>Realities</HI>; which lay a solid Foundation for present Comfort, and give undoubted Assurance of future Felicity. They <HI>behold the Glory of God, in the Face of Jesus Christ, in the Glass of the Gospel</HI>; and by this Means, <HI>are changed into the same Image, from Glory to Glory, even by the Spirit of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>THESE distinguish'd Persons will all set their Seal to the Truth of this Proposition; that the Christian Religion, is every way calculated to promote the Welfare of Man∣kind; and when reduced to Practice, under the Influence of Faith and Love, is the only sure Way to preserve us from every, hurtful and deadly Evil; to obtain true Peace and Pleasure upon Earth, and eternal Happiness in Heaven.</P>
<P>JUSTLY does Doctor <HI>Leighton,</HI> in one of his Letters say;—<Q>Thorns grow every
<PB N="62" REF="006530_0068_10292FF502F7AC90"/>
where, and from all Things here below; but to a Soul transplanted out of it self into the Root of <HI>Jesse,</HI> Peace grows every where too, from him who is our Peace; and whom we shall find to be the more so, the more entirely we live in him, by being dead to the World, to Flesh and Self, and all Things besides him.</Q> O! when shall it be?</P>
<P>INEXPRESSIBLE is the Benefit of this Trans∣plantation: New Life begun, and such a Life as is certainly progressive, even to Life eternal. For, altho' by the unerring Wisdom of the great Head of the Church, <HI>the Cana∣anites are yet left in the Land,</HI> for the Exer∣cise and Tryal of his faithful People; yet they are really and essentially, upon all Ac∣counts, the only happy Persons. I shall mention some few Instances, which will be evident to all such as have, by supernatural Grace, been made Partakers of this thrice happy Change.</P>
<P>As they have been convinced of the Vanity of all Creature Enjoyments, so they have been lead by a divine Attraction, to God the, boundless OCEAN of all possible Good; and in him enjoy a compleat and independent Hapiness. All the Comforts of this Life
<PB N="63" REF="006530_0069_10292FF81A7CF9B0"/>
come with a double Sweetness, as proceeding from their heavenly Father, and conveyed thro' the Channel of the new Covenant.—They have a sacred Assurance that all Things are theirs, whether <HI>Paul,</HI> or <HI>Apollos,</HI> or <HI>Cephas,</HI> or the <HI>World,</HI> or <HI>Life,</HI> or <HI>Death,</HI> or Things present, or Things to come;—<HI>All Things are yours,</HI> says the Apostle, <HI>and ye are Christ's, and Christ is God's.</HI></P>
<P>OH! how inexpressibly great, are the Blessings contain'd in these few Lines. If the true Believer meets with bitter <HI>Afflictions</HI> of various Sorts, he is divinely taught to know how just and reasonable it is, that he should be <HI>made Partaker of the Fellowship of Christ's Sufferings.</HI>—If in Circumstances of distressing <HI>Poverty</HI>; the remembers the Son of God <HI>had not where to lay his Head</HI>; and was obliged to work a Miracle to answer the Demands of the publick <HI>Tribute.</HI> — If the Billows of <HI>Adversity</HI> rise so high, that in the Extremity of Distres, he is ready to say, <HI>the Waters are come into my Soul; I sink deep in the Mire, where there is no standing</HI>; then he is enabled <HI>to look to the Rock, that is higher than he:</HI> And by Faith goes into the Garden, where our blessed Saviour was in such an <HI>Agony, that he sweat great Drops of Blood, and said, My
<PB N="64" REF="006530_0070_10292FFC9DDFFAD0"/>
Soul is sorrowful even unto Death.</HI>—If at any Time, he meets with <HI>reproachful</HI> Treatment from those whom he has laid under the highest Obligations; he takes a Turn in his Medita∣tions, with Jesus Christ, to the <HI>Judgment-Hall,</HI> where he was abused, not only by the worst of Men, but forsaken of his own peculiar Di∣sciples: From thence he ascends the Mount of <HI>Calvary,</HI> where this divine Person suffered a cruel Death, and which was worse than all, endured the Hidings of his Father's Coun∣tenance.</P>
<P>HATH the Lord Jesus Christ done and suffered all this for me! and shall I think much to suffer and Affliction, that he shall see meet to lay upon me!—"No surely!" will be the Language of every humble Belie∣ver. Let me rather <HI>rejoice in Tribulation</HI> or Weakness, that the Strength and Grace of Christ may be manifested in me.</P>
<P>How happy a Cure is an Interest in Christ, for all those malignant Passions, which are so Destrutive to the Peace and Purity of hu∣man Nature! Whence do these Disorders arise, but from the Misapplication of the Passions and Affections, those powerful En∣gines of the Soul, which are polluted and depraved by Sin. But no sooner are we united to Christ, but our Nature is changed;—the
<PB N="65" REF="006530_0071_10292FFE205B8608"/>
Constitution of the Soul is altered;—Life is began;—Holiness is our Element;—and Sin the Aversion of the renewed Mind.</P>
<P>Now he understands that seeming Paradox, when St. <HI>John</HI> says in one Place, <HI>He that is born of God cannot sin</HI>; and again in the same Chapter; <HI>If we say, we have no Sin, we de∣ceive our selves, and the Truth is not in us.</HI> The regenerate Soul cannot sin, with Incli∣nation; it crosses the Grain of the new Nature: And yet he cannot say, he hath no Sin; for he feels the Remains of Corruption, which makes him often complain with St. <HI>Paul: O! wretched Man that I am, who shall deliver me from this Body, of Sin and Death!</HI></P>
<P>THE Desire of the Mind, no longer wander after a Variety of Vanities and Follies, but are fix'd upon God, the only Centre of Rest,—the only adequate Portion of an imnmortal Soul. In Conseqence of this, that impetuous Thirst after Happiness, which is implanted in the Breasts of all Men, is rectified: So that while the natural Man, is always seeking the Living among the Dead, and enquring, <HI>who will shew me any</HI> worldly <HI>Good</HI>;— the Heaven-born Spirit, cries out, <HI>Lord, lift thou up the Light of thy Countenance upon me, so will I rejoice more than when Corn and Wine are increased.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="006530_0072_10293000EFE39520"/>THAT which Bread is to the Hungry, Water to the Thirsty, Rest to the Weary, <HI>that,</HI> and infinitely more, art thou, O my God! to my Soul. Thou art my Strength in Weakness, — my Light in Darkness, — my best Friend in the Absence of all others,—my best Company in the closest Solitude,—my satisfying Portion in all Uncertain∣ties. Even Death it self, cannot deprive the true Believer of his Happiness; but com∣pletes it. While in the World, Grief and Sorrow, which in the carnal Mind, often work Death, in the spiritual Man, produce Life and Peace. He finds more true Comfort, in mourning for Sin, than in all the carnal Pleasures which the World can give.</P>
<P>UPON the whole then, I think it evidently true, that the Christian is the only happy Person in this World; and as to the Future, the Apostle tells us, <HI>Eye hath not seen, Ear hath nor heard, nor hath it entered into the Heart of Man, to conceive, what God hath laid up for them that love him.</HI> And as the Plea∣sure and Advantages of Religion, are inex∣pressibly great here and hereafter; so the Madness and Misery of Irreligion, are inex∣pressibly dreadful, both in this World and the Next.</P>

<P>BEHOLD what Desolation the Enemy hath made in thy once beautiful Creation! How is, our Beauty stained, <HI>and the Glory departed from</HI> us.

<P>AND now I am come to the Fountain of Grace, my Desire the shall boundless: I put up my Request for all the Blessings of the new Covenant; and beseech thee to <HI>fullfil in me,</HI> and mine, <HI>the whole good Pleasure of thy Will, and the Work of Faith with Power.</HI> All the Motives to do this, must flow from thy blessed self; I have nothing to plead, but my own Misery, and the unbounded Compassions of thy Nature. I desire to draw near unto thee, in the prevailing Name of thy deer Son, and ask for Things agreeable to thy Will, and nothing else.</P>

<P>AND now, O my Soul! have I not abun∣dant Encouragement, to hope for all the Blessings of Salvation, when I consider the exact the Suitableness of the Lord Jesus Christ,
<PB N="70" REF="006530_0076_1029300CC7F65480"/>
in his Offices and Qualifications, to redress the Miseries, and supply the Wants, of apostate and miserable Sinners,</P>
<P>ARE all the Race of <HI>Adam,</HI> in their natural State, destitute of spiritual Life, and prone to all Manner of Evil? The Lord Jesus Christ, the Second <HI>Adam,</HI> hath Life in him∣self, and giveth Life unto the World. Are we lost? He came <HI>to seek and to save, those that are lost.</HI> Are our Iniquities ex∣ceedingly multiplied?—He came to save the <HI>chief of Sinners</HI>; and <HI>died, the Just for the Unjust, that he might bring us to God.</HI> Are we Rebels?—<HI>He ascended on High, and re∣ceive Gifts for Men, even for the Rebellious, that the Lord God might dwell among us.</HI> This is exactly what we want, and what is necessary to make us happy: For all the Mi∣sery of Mankind proceeds from this; that we have departed from God: All our Hap∣piness consists in this; that we return unto him.</P>
<P>FURTHERS, are we altogether Bankrupts by Nature, destitute of Strength to serve God, and Righteousness to recommend us to his Favour?—Christ is the LORD OUR RIGH∣TEOUSNESS: <HI>In him it hath pleased the Father</HI>
<PB N="71" REF="006530_0077_1029300E4F988DC0"/>
<HI>that all Fullness should dwell, that of his Full∣ness we might receive Grace for Grace</HI>? Are we ignorant? He is the great Prophet of his Church;—none teaches like him. Are we guilty, condemn'd by the Law of God? Christ is a <HI>Priest for ever after the Order of</HI> Melchisedec; and hath made full Satisfaction to divine Justice, when he <HI>trod the Wine-Press of his Father's Wrath.</HI> Are we too weak to contend with Flesh and Blood, and the Prin∣cipalities and Powers of the Kingdom of Dark∣ness?.—Christ Jesus is the King of his Church; the great <HI>Captain of our Salvation,</HI> through whom his loyal People, shall eventually gain the Conquest over all their spiritual Enemies.</P>
<P>BUT, O blind, unbelieving, impenitent Creatures that we are, while in our natural State!—Sold under Sin; the Captives of Hell; and Slaves to every base and sordid Lust; and until unlightned, insensible either of our Misery or Remedy!—But even in these deplorable Circumstances, how wonder∣fully is our glorious . Redeemer, qualified to redress our Miseries!—He came <HI>to convince the World of Sin. He is exalted a Prince and a Saviour, to give Repentance as well as Re∣mission of Sin. He came to proclaim Liberty to Captives, to open the Prison Doors to them

that art bound:—He save his People from their Sins.</HI>—He is the Bread of Life, to the hungry starving Soul; the Water of Life, to the thirsty perishing Creature. He restores the Wanderer; reclaims the Profligate, and receives the returning Prodigal into his dearest Embraces. <HI>He casts out seven Devils,</HI> remits Thousands of Offences, and then gives Grace <HI>to love much, because much is forgive.</HI> In short, all Manner of Blessings, spiritual and temporal, he offers freely to the greatest Transgressors.</P>
<P>AND now, O my GOD! wilt thou permit, and enable me, a poor, sinful, and unworthy, Creature, to come in the Name, and for the Sake of this all-sufficient Redeemer, to plead with thy glorious Majesty, for Grace to, com∣ply with thy Offers. For altho' it is Truth of the greatest Certainty and Importance, that the Lord Jesus Christ, whom thou hast graciously given, to be the Repairer of our Breaches, is every Way qualified to perform his exalted Office; yet O my God! if thou dost not, of thy sovereign Mercy, draw us by the Cords of thy invincible Grace, to thy Son, and thy Self, we shall, after all, perish eternally.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="006530_0079_10293015B2C2BC58"/>O THAT thou wouldst have Compassion upon the Souls that thou hast made, and exert thy almighty Power for our Deliveance! Shall we perish for Hunger, in Sight of the greatest Plenty!—Shall we die in Poverty, in View of the richesf Treasure!—Yes, we shall,—if thou, of thine own meer Grace, dost not make us <HI>thy willing People in the Day of thy Power.</HI></P>
<P>AND may I not have an humble Hope, that thou hast performed this great Work, in and for me? And may I not accept this as an Evidence of thy special Love? <HI>In me, that, is, in my Flesh, there dwells no good Thing. Of my Self I can do Nothing, all my Suffici∣ency is in God.</HI> In the uninterrupted Com∣munications of thy Spirit doth the of my Soul consist.</P>
<P>To thee therefore, who art the Fountain of LIGHT AND LIFE, <HI>and the Giver of every good and perfect Gift,</HI> I desire always to come and here to wait, in the diligent Use of all appointed Means, for all suitable Good of every Kind. I renounce every other Depen∣dance, for <HI>Justification,</HI> but the Blood of JESUS;—for <HI>Sanctification,</HI> but the powerful Operations of the Spirit.—I desire now, and

perpetually, to receive this JESUS, as the Prophet, Priest, and King of my Salvation; to bring me to all the Happiness of his re∣deemed People.</P>
<P>I COME to thee, O divine Redeemer! not imagining I have any Thing of my own to commend me to thy Acceptance.—Never was there any of the Race of apostate <HI>Adam</HI> saved, but such as God was pleased <HI>to create a-new in Christ Jesus unto good Works.</HI> Never was there any prior Goodness in any of all that unhappy Stock, to induce thy sacred Majesty, to perform that miraculous Work for them;—the Motives are in thy Self;—According to the unsearchable Riches of thy Grace in Christ, thou bestowest Redemption upon us. In the Covenant which thou proposest to our Acceptance, thou hast taken the Work into thine own Hand; this is one of its glorious Articles,—<HI>I will cause them to approach unto me with their whole Hearts, and,</HI> when we thus approach unto thee, thou hast graciously promised, <HI>I will be their God, and they shall be my People.</HI> Thus, thou art the ALPHA and OMEGA of our Salvation,—the whole Work is thine from the Foun∣dation to the Top-Stone. I come to thee,

<P>WILT thou be pleased to hear and answer, and do for me and mine, and the whole <HI>Israel</HI> of God, as our various Wants and Miseries, Sins and Sorrows, require; not according to our Deserts, but thy undeserved Grace, in Christ Jesus our Lord.

<P>BUT, <HI>bless the Lord, O my Soul! and all that is within me, bless his Holy Name</HI>; that when my Soul was all over a dark and dis∣order'd Chaos; when my Nature was fill'd with nothing but Wretchedness and Pollution;—when I had no true Knowledge, either of my Misery and Remedy, but was <HI>dead in Trespasses and Sins,</HI> without Power to help my self; — That then, <HI>O,</HI> my GOD! <HI>it was a Time of thy Love</HI>; thou by thy illumina∣ting Grace didst enable me to see my miser∣able, lost guilty and bankrupt Circumstances, by Nature and Practice; and in this distres∣sing Exigence, when there was no human Eye to pity me, nor any created Arm that could help me, wast graciously pleased to

<PB N="82" REF="006530_0088_1029302B5DED4528"/>
of all my Happiness! I never found Rest, but in thy Self, O my God, and heavenly Father! <HI>Thou art my only Portion in the Land of the Living</HI>;—my Comfort in the obscurest Retirement;—my unfailing Friend in a strange Land;—my sure Defence in Times of the greatest Danger. Thou hast been my Health in Sickness;—my Strength in Weakness;—my Light in Darkness;—<HI>my dwelling Place, my strong</HI> Rock, <HI>my Refuge,</HI> from my Youth up.</P>
<P>HOW often have I been assaulted by they Corruptions of Flesh and Blood, and <HI>the Principalities and Powers of the Kingdom of Darkness</HI>; when I my self had no Strength for the Battle; no Power to resist my num∣berless and powerful Adversaries! but thou didst <HI>strengthen me with Strength in the in∣ward Man,</HI> and prevent me from falling, a weak and defenceless Prey, into their de∣structive Hands.</P>
<P>LET the set my Seal, to thy Covenant Faithfulness and Love; <HI>thou hast caused me to approach unto thee,</HI> thro' thy beloved Son;—<HI>to look up to Jesus,</HI> my Almighty Saviour, and lay hold on <HI>his Strength and Righteous∣ness</HI>; and in his Name, and under his Conduct,
<PB N="83" REF="006530_0089_1029302DD7CE6028"/>
I have been enabled, so far to get the Con∣quest, that every Asault hath engaged me more strongly to depend on my Almighty Leader; and the hellish Legions have been disappointed, and put to Flight:—Sin hath appeared more vile, and Christ more precious, under all my Trials and Difficulties. Christ hath' been my Strength, and Safety;—my Intercessor and Advocate. I have found him at all Times, <HI>the Way, the truth, and the Life.</HI></P>
<P>O! ASTONISHING Grace, and Goodness, to the Worst of Sinners!—I am nothing in my self, but Christ is ALL IN ALL;—He is my inexhausted Treasure, my perpetual Sup∣port, my continual Feast, the only Founda∣tion of my Hope and Joy;—upon him I depend for Perseverance to the End, <HI>that neither Life nor Death, may separate me from his Love.</HI> I undertake no Part, in my own Strength; — the Work is all thine; the Motives, are altogether in thy Self: Had the Motives been any good Thing in me, then a Failure upon my Part would have forfeited all. <HI>But the Work of the Lord is perfect</HI>;—thy Good-Will is immutable, he that hath <HI>laid the Foundation, will also lay the Top Stone, with shouting, crying, Grace, Grace unto it.</HI></P>

<P>O! MY dear Redeemer, my glorious and ascended Advocate! when thou wast upon Earth, thou did'st graciously invite, all poor, miserable, and burthened Souls, <HI>to come to thee, that they might have Rest.</HI> And the Invitation still remains upon Record in full Force, for the Incouragement of Mankind in all Ages, to apply to thee, under the insup∣portable Weight of their innumerable Sins and Sorrows, for all desirable Succour and Relief.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="006530_0094_1029303D57668250"/>O GOD! who surveyest the whole Creation, and from whom no secret Tho't can be hid: Thou knowest the bitter Grief, and distressing Sorrow, with which my Soul is borne down, and under which I should inevitably sink, if not supported by thy gracious Hand.

<P>THOU, O gracious God, and merciful Re∣deemer! art the only Restorer of our ruined Race, <HI>the</HI> only <HI>Repairer of our Breaches.</HI> I desire to come at thy gracious Invitation, and bring my self, and my Children, and lay them at thy blessed Feet.

I have nothing of my own to bring with me, for every good Incli∣nation or Desire, is the Effect of thy Grace, and encreases my Oligations.</P>
<P>I DESIRE, with a deep and filial Sorrow, to confess my Original Sin, that Fountain of all Corruption. <HI>Behold!

<P>O MY GOD! by thy undeserved and sparing Goodness, I am once more brought to the Light of another Morning; surrounded with innumerable Mercies: I desire, with Humility and Gratitude, to offer up my Morning Sa∣crifice, of Adoration, Praise, and Thanks∣giving; — with unfeigned Sorrow for all the ungrateful Returns, which I have made for thy innumerable Favours; — with a strong Faith in thy glorious Majesty, to enable me, to reform what has been amiss, for the future.</P>
<P>BUT, O! how incapable am I, to perform this of my self, if not excited and supported by thy Grace!

<P>THIS is what my Soul earnestly longs for;—then shall I be enabled to make such an Offering, as thou with accept in Jesus Christ.—To whom, with thy glorious Majesty, and Blessed Spirit of Grace, the Comforter, be ever rendered, with my whole Soul, Blessing, Honour, Glory, and Power, from this Time, and forever, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<P>O MY GOD! since I am thus permitted to draw near unto thy gracious Majesty; wilt thou be pleased to draw near unto me, and afford me thy Blessing and Presence; that I may ask those Things that are agreeable to thy Will, with Humility, Faith and Fervency! that so they may be favourably received, and graciously answered, thro' Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>IS it not, O my God, and heavenly Father! agreeable to thy Will, that all thy Creatures should obey thy righteous Commandments? — Certainly it is: — Have I not then a War∣rant from thy Divine Majesty, to pray for that Grace and Strength, by which I may be inclined and enabled to perform this Obedience.</P>
<P>IT is therefore agreeable to thy Will, that I should receive the Offers of the Gospel, be renewed in the Spirit of my Mind, conform'd to the Image of God; and in order to this, should pray, for the Agency of thy blessed Spirit, which only can qualify me to do any

good Thing;—and intercede with thee, that <HI>thy Kingdom may come, and thy Will be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven.</HI> These are Things which thou hast commanded me to do; and therefore I am sure, are agreeable to thy holy Will.</P>
<P>THESE, O my God! (allow me to say) are the Sum and Substance of all my Wishes for my self and Posterity, to the End of Time. O! when shall the Time come, when our great Redeemer shall triumph in this miserable Earth; and bring <HI>all Nations, Tongues and Languages,</HI> to a chearful Subjection to his mild and righteous Government!</P>

<P>THY Presence I invite into my Soul, as the Sum of all my Happiness: Thou knowest O my God! that I should look upon the whole Creation, as a dark and disordered Scene, if not enlightned with the refreshing Rays of thy Love; and that I despise all its Glories, Riches and Pleasures, as contemptible Dross, in Comparison with the Smiles of thy Counte∣nance!

And that I may so read as to understand the Meaning of the blessed Spirit, I will lift up my Heart to GOD THE FATHER, the Foun∣tain of all Good, that of his infinite Mercy,

<P>AND that it may be really and truly so, I desire, this Morning, by the Assistance of the Blessed Spirit, to renew my Covenant with this ONE GOD, <HI>Father, Son</HI> and <HI>Holy Ghost</HI>; and humbly desire, with a fiducial Confidence, in my good and gracious God, to commit to the Custody, and devote to the Service, of his Divine Majesty, all I have, and all I am, for Time and Eternity; with a firm Dependance, O! my gracious and

Covenant-keeping GOD! that thou wilt con∣duct me by thy Spirit, lead me into all Truth, and preserve me from all Manner of Evil.</P>
<P>I DEPEND wholly upon the Strength of thine omnipotent Arm, to <HI>fulfil all thy Works in me,</HI> for it is <HI>by thy mighty Power, that any are kept unto eternal Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>AND now, my Soul, that thou mayst live agreeable to thy Privileges and Obligations, it is necessary, that the Fire of the Morning Sacrifice, should be kept alive by devout. Ejaculations, in the midst of all the Business, and Occurrences of the Day. For the Grace to perform one Duty, is not sufficient for another; but with <HI>David,</HI> our Eyes must forever be unto the Lord, we must look up for continual Supplies, <HI>in every Time of Need.</HI> To live in this Way is to live indeed;—then we maintain, a constant Intercourse, between God and our Souls; and enjoy a Nearness to God in Christ Jesus; in which Nearness, consists all our Safety and Happiness.</P>
<P>O, MY GOD! whose Prerogative alone it is to give Faith, enable me now, and at all Times, <HI>to cast Anchor, within the Vail, whi∣ther my Fore-runner is entered</HI>; that I may

<P>O MY GOD! I desire this Morning, with humble Thankfulness, to acknowledge, the innumerable Mercies of my Life, in every Stage, Situation, and Circumstance. From the Moment of my Conception; from the Time when I hung on my Mother's Breast, to the present Day, my Life hath been filled with Mercy. When I look all around me, I find my Self surrounded with Mercies; Food, Raiment, and a comfortable Place of Abode, a great Degree of Health and Strength, and the Use of my intellectual Faculties.—</P>
<P>THOU hast bestowed upon me, O my GOD! the Powers of Reason and Recollection, by which I am enabled to contemplate the Perfections of the Supreme Being, and to see the visible Foot-steps of thy Wisdom, Power and Goodness, which are instamp'd on all the Works that thou hast made.</P>
<P>BUT, O my God! I must humbly make my sorrowful Complaint, that altho' I know
<PB N="103" REF="006530_0109_102930628BB6DB08"/>
all this, and in some Measure feel the Weight of my Obligations to thy glorious Majesty; yet I have an ungrateful Heart, prone to backslide from thee. Were the noble Pow∣ers and Faculties, of the Soul, if thoroughly sanctified, and consecrated to thy Service, how happy should I live? How serene and peaceable a State should I continually enjoy? But now I am compelled to cry out, <HI>O miserable Creature, that I am, who shall deliver me from this Body of Sin and Death!</HI></P>
<P>MAY I not have Leave, O my God! with humble Confidence to say, I am instructed where to go, with good Ground to hope for Success. My dear Redeemer hath bidden me to pray, that <HI>thy Kingdom may come, and thy Will be done, in Earth as it is in Heaven:</HI> And if this Petition, which our glorious Lord hath put into our Mouths, be granted, all Things will be essentially and eventually right; the Want of this is all our Misery.</P>
<P>THE Heart of Man in its original Purity, was a glorious Temple, a <HI>Palace</HI> designed for the Residence of the most HIGH GOD. His Kingdom was set up there; His Image was engraven upon our Nature;—<HI>But Woe unto

us that we have sinned.</HI>—By this the Spirit of God was affronted and banish'd, and <HI>Satan</HI> usurped the Throne of our Hearts. What a dreadful Havock, hath the Enemy made in this once glorious Palace!</P>
<P>O MY GRACIOUS GOD! I humbly beseech thee to look down in much Mercy, upon these desolated Ruins! How are all our Powers depraved and vitiated! How doth Satan carry the natural Man Captive, and transform him into a Slave to every vile and unprofitable Lust! O set thy Creatures free from this infamous Servitude;—restore our ruin'd Nature; sanctify those Faculties, which under the Conduct of thy Grace, are admi∣rably suited, to bring Honour to their Al∣mighty Maker, and advance their own Per∣fection and Happiness.</P>
<P>O, MY GOD! I humbly beseech thee, for the Sake of my dear Redeemer, now and at all Times to bestow upon me, thy Grace, that I may offer up such Petitions and Re∣quests, as thou wilt graciously hear and an∣swer; and such Dispositions of Soul, as thou wilt be pleased with. <HI>On thee do I wait all the Day long</HI>; the constant Aspirations of my Soul, shall be to thee.

<P><HI>O my Soul, why art thou cast down, and why so disquieted,</HI> upon any Account? Why do I not say fiducially, <HI>Hope thou in God, for thou shalt yet praise him, for the Help of his Countenance.</HI> Surely there must be some grand Defect, in that Faith, Love, and holy Confidence, which thy God may justly expect from one, on whom he hath bestow'd so many signal and distinguishing Favours. Thy tem∣poral Mercies, O GOD! have been great and numerous; repeated swift as the Moments fly, and continued to the present Time. And tho' those are great in themselves, and much more so, when I consider, how by my Sins I have forfeited all Good; and am become ob∣noxious to every Evil: Yet they are small when compared with those inconceivably grea∣ter Blessings,—The Gift of thy Son;—the Operations of thy Spirit.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="006530_0112_10293069EB4CAFB0"/>HATH not thy God, enabled thee to say;—Thou <HI>art he whom my Soul longeth for.</HI> When shall it once be, that all the Powers of my Body, and Faculties of my Soul, will be wholly, and without Interruption, em∣ployed in thy Service, and to thy Glory! Are not these certain Indications, of a divine Birth,—a new Creation; which could not be produced by any other Hand than that which at first created all Things. And I desire to depend upon the same Almighty Power, to finish that Work which thou hast begun. And as I received all from thee, so I owe all to thee, and desire to dedicate all to thee, renouncing all Dependance upon myself, trusting entirely to the Strength and Grace of the Redeemer. I desire more constantly and uninterruptedly, to lift up my Soul to thee, by constant ejaculatory Aspirations; and to commit my∣self to thee, as <HI>Wax</HI> to the <HI>Seal,</HI> that thou wouldest form me into thy own Resemblance, and fit me for the Service and Enjoyment of thy Self: As I desire to depend upon thee for Strength, so I desire to trust only in the Righteousness of Christ for Justification.</P>
<P>HERE I venture my All for Time and Eternity. Upon this Foundation I sat out, in the Christian Race, when I was young;
<PB N="107" REF="006530_0113_1029306CB0ED9AB0"/>
And upon a Review of the Conduct of God towards me, in my whole Life, I have rea∣son to set my Seal, that God is true to all his Promises;— that all his Ways, are <HI>Ways of Pleasantness, and all his Paths are Peace.</HI></P>
<P>IN thy Strength, O my gracious and mer∣ciful Father! I resolve to persist in this Way, and lie waiting at the Footstool of thy Grace.—If I perish, I will perish here:—To whom else should I go, thou only hast the <HI>Words of Eternal Life.</HI> Amen.</P>

<P><HI>LIFT</HI> up your Heads, O ye Gates! and be lift up, ye everlasting Doors! and the <HI>KING OF GLORY</HI> shall come in.</P>
<P>I DESIRE, O my God! to acknowledge with the highest Thankfulness and Gratitude, thy unparalell'd and condescending Grace, to sinful and rebellious Mankind. That when by Sin, he had affronted the infinite Majesty of Heaven, and caused thee to withdraw thy favourable Presence from him; yet that thou who art the KING OF KINGS, should contrive to restore the human Race again to thy Favour, and art inviting us to the most intimate Com∣munication with thy self: Knocking at the Door of our Hearts; demanding Admittance,
<PB N="108" REF="006530_0114_10293070CFB66A48"/>
by the external Calls of thy Word, and the internal Operations of thy Spirit.—</P>
<P>THE Terms of our entertaining so divine a Guest, are the most advantageous, that can be imagined. We are required to open the Doors of our Hearts, and give him a joyful Ad∣mission; and resign ourselves to be governed by his just and righteous Laws.— What can be more reasonable and serviceable? <HI>In keeping God's Commandments there is great Reward</HI>: And all will find that it is true, who make the happy Experiment.</P>
<P>AND if the Conditions are so advantageous, What is the Blessing it self!—Here, O my Soul! I am lost in a Croud of Thoughts; I have no Words adequate to my Conceptions, and my Conceptions fall infinitely short, of the Excellency of the Subject they are em∣ployed about. If I consider the wide Destruc∣tion, which Sin hath brought upon our Frame, which from a beautiful Habitation of the most High, is turned into a Receptacle of every base and unclean Lust: How justly may <HI>my Head be Waters,</HI> and my Eyes Fountains of Tears, to weep for the affecting Alteration! When I consider, the melancholly State of this lower World, by Reason of the Fall of Man, I
<PB N="109" REF="006530_0115_102930738F41D688"/>
may say, <HI>At this my Belly trembles, an Heart is removed out of its Place. Horro∣takes hold of me, because of the Wicked, that forsake thy Law.</HI> As to my self, upon the srictest Search, I think I can say, that the Remains of Sin in me, are the greatest Bur∣den I feel, and the only Thing that makes Life bitter to me. If the Absence of the glorious God be so dreadful, how inconceive∣ably reviving must be the Return of this blessed Inhabitant!</P>
<P>To approach unto thee, O my God! is all my Happiness, in the Present and future World: May I therefore never admit, any Thing into my Heart and Memory, that shall be affronting to thy blessed Spirit! May I always endeavour by every Means, <HI>to lift up the Doors of my Soul,</HI> and invite the Presence of this sacred Guest. It is thy Demand, <HI>Son give me thy Heart:</HI> Give me Power, I beseech thee, unfeignedly to obey thy Voice. Favour me with thy unerring Guidance, to lead me in that Way, which is for the Glory, of thy Name, and the Salvation of my Soul; for my dear Redeemer's Sake: To whom, with the Father, and Holy Spirit, be ascribed all Honour and Glory Dominion and Power, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<P>O MOST merciful and glorious God, the FATHER, the SON, and the HOLY-GHOST. I desire to dedicate without Reserve, all I am, and all I have, to thee, to whom of Right I belong; imploring thy continual As∣sistance, that I may employ my Time and Talents, in thy Service, to the End of my Life,—That I may take thy Word for my Rule, thy Glory for my ultimate End, and in all my Actions advance the Kingdom of thy Grace.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="006530_0117_1029307779258C10"/>I TAKE God the FATHER, for my God and Father,— JESUS CHRIST for my Lord and Redeemer,—the HOLY SPIRIT for my Sanctifier and Redeemer. And resolve, by thy Grace, that I will hate Nothing but Sin, that I will take Pleasure in Nothing but what is agreeable to thy Will. And I beseech my glorious God, that he would increase my Faith, enflame my Love, and invigorate my Desires, after a greater Conformity to, and Acquaintance with my dear Redeemer, and give me a more full and absolute Sub∣mission to the Dispensations of thy unerring Providence.</P>
<P>BLESS, the Lord, <HI>O my Soul!</HI> for the daily and common Mercies with which thou art sur∣rounded. Bless him above all for redeeming Love, the never failing Spring of Grace and Goodness; in <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> the true Believer possesses all Things: A well grounded Hope of an Interest in his Merits, is a continual Feast, and inspires the Soul with that happy Peace and Tranquility, which infinitely exceeds the most delightful Pleasures of Sense. This, and this alone, gives the Soul an Happiness independent of the whole World of Creatures, which accompanies it where-ever it goes, and supports it under the most distressing Bereave∣ments.

<P>O GOD! thou art the Almighty Creator, the continual Preserver, the bountiful Bene∣factor, supreme Lord and Proprietor, of all Things visible and invisible. Thou art the only worthy Object of my Admiration, Adoration and Fear: And in and thro' Jesus Christ, the delightful Object of my Love, Complacency and Confidence. It is therefore, not only my indispensable Duty, but highest Happiness and Safety, to conse∣crate my self, in the most solemn Manner, to the ever blessed TRINITY, in whose Name, I was baptized, and to whose Service I was devoted in my Infancy.</P>
<P>ADORED be thy Name, that I have been enabled from my Youth up, to take these my baptismal Bonds upon my self, and solemnly to renew my Covenant Dedication. O my God! forgive the Iniquity of my Holy Duties, and sprinkle all my Covenant Tran∣saction with <HI>the Blood of Jesus.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="006530_0119_1029307D85747FE8"/>IF I have ever been sincere, in these my solemn Approaches to thy gracious Majesty, it was because thou, of thy Free Grace, didst make me so;—To thee therefore, be the Glory, Honour, Thanksgiving and Praise,—but <HI>to me belongs Shame and Con∣fusion of Face.</HI> I should never have un∣feignedly return'd to thee, the Lord my God, hadst thou not drawn me, by the constrain∣ing Charms of thy Grace and Love; and effectually convinc'd me of the Vanity and Insufficiency of every Creature, to satisfy the boundless Cravings of my immortat Soul. And didst not thou, by the Illumina∣tions of thy Spirit, lead me to the Redeemer, upon whose Account alone, I could possibly expect Pardon and Acceptance, Strength and Assistance.</P>
<P>AND now, what Words can I take to express my Thankfulness and Gratitude, for thy distinguishing Mercies: I desire humbly to bewail all my Ingratitude to thee the <HI>God of all Grace and Consolation.</HI>—How often have I grieved thy Holy Spirit,'by my careless and inattentive Conduct, not∣withstanding all the endearing Obligations, thou hast laid me under! When I review my Life I find that in many Things I have
<PB N="114" REF="006530_0120_1029307FF31E6148"/>
offended thee, my heavenly Father; and in all Things have fallen short of my Duty to God and my Fellow-Creatures;—All my Faults have been attended with this great Aggravation, that they were a Violation of my solemn Vows and Covenant Engagements.</P>
<P>How just and equitable is the Apostle's Exhortation, <HI>I beseech you therefore, Brethren, by the Mercies of God, that you present your Bodies a living Sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable Service.</HI> How criminal and sacrilegious is every Deviation from my Covenant Vows; every Departure from my rightful Lord and Master.</P>
<P>I BLESS thy glorious Majesty, that thou hast not punished me according to my Iniqui∣ties, nor taken away from me thy forfeited Blessings. But that thou art still continuing to me the Strivings of thy Holy Spirit, and hast so far overcome the natural Depravity of my Heart, that Sin is my greatest Aversion; thy Service my highest Delight: That my Hopes and Fears, Desires and Delights, my supreme Choice and Affection, centers in the living and unchangeable God. O! that it were more perfectly so!—If thou art my Por∣tion, I shall certainly be happy, tho' destitute of every Thing else. If thou with-holdest

thy Favour, I must be inexpressibly miserable, tho' plac'd in the Bosom of Heaven itself.</P>
<P>UNDER a deep Conviction of these Things, I desire again to renew, the Dedication of my self unto thee. But what have I now to offer, but what is thine already, by the most indis∣putable Title, and the strongest Obligations. I would give up my Heart unto thee, O my God! it being the best Offering I have to make; humbly praying. That thou wouldest be pleased to take it, into thine own Hand, and form it for thy self. Kindle within it, such a Flame of divine Love, as shall destroy every other Affection, which stands in Com∣petition with thee. To thee therefore, O almighty Sovereign, and heavenly Father! To thee, O compassionate Advocate and Re∣deemer! To thee, O eternal Guide and Com∣forter of thy Church, do I dedicate my self and my Children, in an EVERLASTING CO∣VENANT <HI>never to be broken.</HI> Resolving to wait at the Footstool of Free Grace, for those divine Communications, which are necessary to enable me to live more entirely to thy Glory; and finally, to make <HI>me meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light.</HI> I desire to have my entire Dependance upon my dear Redeemer;—his Strength for the Perfor∣mance;

<P>IF there has been any Thing in the Trans∣actions of this Day, that is the Breathing of thy holy Spirit, be pleased to hear, answer and accept it; and every Thing of my own, pity and pardon. O my gracious God! <HI>hear my</HI> Cry, <HI>attend to the Voice of my Requests,</HI> and do for me, for mine, and the <HI>the whole Israel of God,</HI> according to thy Covenant Faithful∣ness, and the Boundless Riches of thy Grace, in JESUS CHRIST OUR LORD.</P>
<P>To whom, with thy glorious Majesty, and eternal Spirit, be ascribed, as is most due, all Honour, Adoration and Praise, now and for ever more, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<L>It grieves me, Lord, it grieves me sore,</L>
