<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>MUCH might be said, were it necessary, for the dedication <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> books unto persons of worth, interest, service, and honour, by reason it has been the almost constans practice of the best and wisest men, in all the ages of the world. Besides, Sir, a per∣formance of this nature could not possibly be dedicated to any person more suitable than yourself, as being the great patron of the Ame∣rican cause; and one who h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s shewn to the world that he was sent into it to perform wonders, under God. It is needless to relate your great talents in bearing both with prosperity and adversity, therefore I need not make no other apology for my present pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ce. What is written is permanent</HI> litera scripta manet, <HI>and spreads itself farther by far, for time, place, and persons, than the voice can reach. Augustine writing to Volusian faith, "That which is written is always at hand to be read when the reader is at leisure." Great sir, pray let it be the top of your ambition, and the heighth of all your designs, to glorify God, to secure your interest in Christ, to serve your generation, to provide for eternity, to walk with God, to be tender of all that have,</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iquid Christi, <HI>any thing of Christ shining in them, and so to steer your course in this world as that you may give up your account at last with joy.

It is said that it so blinded Cardinal Bourbon, that he said he would not lose his part in Paris for his part in Paradise. But, alas! what is all the glory of this world but a mere blaze. It is said that at the enthronization of the Pope before he is set in his chair, and puts on his tripple crown, a piece of tow, or a wad of straw, is set on fire before him, and one appointed to say,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> transit gloria <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <HI>the glory of this world is but a blaze▪ High seats are al∣ways <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>easy, and crowns themselves are always stuffed with thorns, which made one say of his crown O crown!

<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>IT is now going on three years since I first wrote this piece. Great and glorious events have since taken place in our po∣litical affairs; and, I hope, the day is not far distant when peace, on the most honourable and advantageous terms, for America, shall be proclaimed throughout these United States. However, not knowing now much longer the war, by reason of our sins, might be continued, I concluded it might not be amiss to cast my mite into the treasury, in order to vindicate the conduct of all those brave officers and men who have already, and may yet fall in the American war, in defence of our rights and liberties, civil and religious; and also to clear up the doubts and scruples of tender consciences, as to the lawfulness of taking up arms in any case whatsoever. I acknowledge that there have already been many able pens employed in stating the justice of our cause, and none, in my opinion, merits more our thanks than the author of Common Sense; but none, that I have seen, has, to my satisfaction, cleared up the lawfulness of the use of defensive arms against tyrants and tyranny, whene∣ver they shall endeavour to deprive a people of their liberty and property. It is, surely, a pity that some abler hand had not undertaken the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, who might have done greater justice to the cause. All that I have, or chuse, to say, in praise of the performance, is, that the author means honestly, and shall ever pray for the success of the American arms▪ and those of her allies, in the present just defensive war; and that he never has, nor never means to spare himself, whenever he may be called upon to face the enemies of his country, if even it should, as it may, cost him his life; for where could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e offer it better than on the altar of religion and liberty, fighting in defence of both?</P>
<P>And now for a word of advice to the brave officers and sol∣diers composing the American army.—Gentlemen officers, let m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> entreat you to desist from all vice, and practice virtue; fear God and obey your superio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s; set good examples before your men; be tender and careful of their lives and health; discountenance vice and encourage virtue in them; do not correct nor abuse them but according to martial law.—I once read of a good old general that was walking through his army, when at length, he saw a young prodigal officer beating an old soldier unmercifully: O! says the general, <HI>lay on, for you know that he dare not strike you again!</HI> Which reproof, though very modest, covered the officer with blushes, and caused him to desist.—And, in fact, it is a sure sign of a coward, to be beating a man that we know dare not, for his life, resist.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="017905_0003_0FA37A4AC3225288"/>
Some time past I was at West-Point, and saw an officer, with an unmerciful club, beating a poor druken soldier; and, after he was tired, ordered some under<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing to continue the chas∣tisement, which he did in a most horrid manner, knocking him down, and beating him over head and face, until the blood gushed out of almost every part of his body; many officers ga∣thering round, said <HI>lay on,</HI> and damning him that dare say otherways, until I thought he would have been killed right out: but at length one h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne, good o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>cer spoke, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> said, stop! if he has done amiss, confine him; and if, upon trial, he is found guilty, let him be punished accordingly.—He was confined, and, I suppose, punished again for the same essence; which is contrary to all justice, to punish a man twice for the same crime.</P>
<P>And you, my dear brother soldiers, let me beg of you to consider you have souls to be saved or lost; therefore cease from the practise of sin, and practise holiness in the fear of God; honour and obey your officers; and see that you become the true soldiers of Jesus Christ; and not on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> he fighting soldiers, but praying ones also. But to conclude I would inform <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth gentlemen officers and soldiers, that you shall have my prayers for your present and eternal welfare, &amp;c.</P>

<P>I DO freely confess, that this truth is of such a nature, that it can scarcely be illustrated by demonstration; not for the darkness thereof, but for its self evidencing clearness, being scarcely capable of any farther elucidation than what it offered to the rational understanding by its simple proposition, as first principles can hardly be proven, because they need no pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ba∣tion, and cannot be made any clearer than they really <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and such persons as cannot, or will not, consent to then, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> in my opinion, incapable of conceiving any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> And I do affirm, that self preservation and defence i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> right and lawful, because it is congenite with, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> nature that hath a self which it can preserve, can scarcely be more illustrated that it may do so, than that it can do so; and therefore, all that have a true respect to their own▪ as well as a due concern in the interest of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> and their country's rights and liberties; I say, to such worthy characters it might seem superfluous to make a doubt or a debate of this self evi∣dent truth. And was it not that there have been, and still are, a generation of morta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s shall I call them men) in our land that are as great monsters in nature <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they are malignant in religion; and as great perve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ters of the law of nature as they are sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erters of municipal laws, and verters of the laws of God, I have reason to believe this present war would not have been spun out to such a length.—I have not undertaken to write this small piece with any great prospect of convincing such characters; but my chief view was to comfort the minds of such persons whose near and dear connections have fallen, or may yet fall, in the glorious cause of liberty and virtue; and to clear up the doubts that tender consciences may enter∣tain, as to the lawfulness of a defensive war.—It does appear clear, that it has been the practice of all nations in the world, and the greatest and best of men have, in all ages, maintained this principle; and many, for adhering to it, have suffered death, and sealed the truth thereof with their blood. Read Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>drow's and Cruckshank's history of the two brothers bloody reign, from 1660, to the glorious revolution in 1688, containing twenty-eight years; which, by the godly, was just∣ly called the killing time. Also let us read our own history
<PB N="7" REF="017905_0004_0FA37A4B8485AF30"/>
of the American war from April 19, 1775, to June, 17, 1779, and we shall not be wanting of instances of many suffering by the hands of British tyranny, for maintaining this principle of self defence, in defence of our lives and liberties. It is well known that the Americans did not hastily, nor violently, rush in to the present war. They did petition, remonstrate, and restrained trade; nay▪ took every reasonable method that rea∣sonable creatures could invent, in order to prevent the effusion of human blood. But when they found all their humble pe∣titions rejected, and treated with the greatest scorn and con∣tempt; and that nothing would go down with proud, haugh∣ty North and his s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly tool George the III, and their associates in wickedness, but a total surrender of all our rights and li∣berties, and an unconditional submission, they did take up arms to defend themselves from the unjust and wicked en∣croachments of haughty Britain; and, if we may judge from the success of our arms, we may rationally conclude that hea∣ven approves of our undertaking, and that the God of battle has gone forth with our armies.—But not to enlarge upon a subject so manifest, I now proceed to prove the lawfulness of taking up arms to oppose all tyranny, oppression, and those who ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se and misuse their authority. This great truth is sufficiently made manifest by the most famous and learned pa∣trons and champions for this excellent privilege of mankind, the unanswerable authors of <HI>Lex Rex,</HI> the apologetical relation Naphta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i and <HI>Jus Populi Vindicatum.</HI> But because it is easy to add to what is found, I shall subjoin my mite; and their argu∣ments being various and scattered at large through their books, I shall endeavour to collect a compend of them in some order.</P>
<P>The two first of these authors do treat of a defensive, war under the direction of a parliament, like that in England <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the year 1645; and the two last of resistance against the abuse of a lawful power, when the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no access to maintain our rights and liberties in any other way; which seems to come the near∣est to our case, for we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no British parliament to be conducted by; but, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thereof, had recourse to a congress; nor did we ever dispu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the lawfulness of the king of England's right to the crown, and to govern according to the laws and constitution thereof; but when he and his creatures undertook to govern us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to law, then did we most justly undertake to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> encroachments of a tyrant. But, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the enemies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> country, it is no ways lawful, in any case, or upon any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ence whatsoever, to resist kingly
<PB N="8" REF="017905_0005_0FA37A4C42DD0070"/>
authority, in whomsoever it be resident, or which way soever it be erected or conducted. O! poor passive slaves!</P>
<P>I shall now endeavour to consider it more complexly and extensively, and plead both for resistance against the abuse of a lawful power are against the use and usurpation of a tyrannical power, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ser not only the lawfulness of resisting kings, when they abuse their power, as is made manifest by the above named authors, but also the expediency and necessity of the duty of re∣sisting this tyrannical power, whenever we are, by a good pro∣vidence of God, called there unto; and this we must do, if we would not be found betrayers of the liberties of our country and brethren, together with the ruin of our poor posterity, which, if we should neglect to do, we shall be instruments of delivering up these i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>stimable blessings into the devouring jaws of tyran∣ny; which if we should be tame enough to do, shall we not bring on us the curse of Meroz and the curse of our brethren's blood, crying for vengeance on the heads of the shedders thereof, and upon all who being in a capacity came not to their rescue;—and the curse of posterity would have been upon us for not transmit∣ing that liberty whereof we were, by the valour of our worthy forefathers, put and left in possession of. I shall not, therefore, restrict myself to the question propounded ordinarily, to wit, whether or not, when a limited king doth really injure, oppress, and invade his subjects civil rights and liberties, and sends out his bloody emissaries, with armed violence against them; and when all redress, or hope, by any address or petition, is rendered void; then, and in that case, may a community of such subjects defend themselves and their liberties by arms, in resisting his bloody emissaries. But to bring it home to our present case, and answer the laxness of the adversaries position of the uncon∣troulableness of every one that wears a crown, I shall slate it thus, whether or not it is a duty for a community to endeavour, in the defence of their lives, laws, and liberties, to resist the ty∣ranny of prevailing dominators, using and abusing their power, to the subverting and invading the liberties and overturning the fundamental laws of the country?—I hold to the affirmative, and shall attempt to prove it; and, in prosecuting this subject, I shall first premit some concessory considerations to clear it, and then bring reasons to prove it.</P>
<P>In the first place for clearing of this truth, and taking of mis∣takes, then concessions may be considered.</P>
<P>First. I do allow that the ordinance of majestracy, which is of God, is not to be resisted; no, not so much as by disobedience
<PB N="9" REF="017905_0005_0FA37A4C42DD0070"/>
or non-obedience; nay, not so much as menta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly, by cursing in the heart. Eccles. x. 20. But a person clothed therewith abu∣sing his power, may be so far resisted; but tyrants, or magistrates turning tyrants, are not God's ordinances; and there is no ha∣zard of damnation for resusing to obey their unjust commands; but rather, the hazard of that is in walking willingly after the commandment, when the statutes of Omri are kept; so that what is objected from Eccles. viii. 2. 4. <HI>I counsel thee to keep the king's commandments, &amp;c.</HI> Is to be understood only of the law∣ful commands of lawful things.</P>
<P>Second. I do allow that rebellion is a damnable sin, except: where the word is taken in a lax sense, as Israel of old is said to have rebelled against Rehoboam and good Hezekiah against Se∣nacherib, which was a good rebellion and a clear duty. Being taken there for resistance and revolt, in this sense, the Americans rising in arms may be called rebellion, for it is right and lawful, to all intents and purposes, to rebel against tyrants, as all are who offer, or attempt, to govern contrary to the laws of the land; for where law ceases, tyranny begins. But because the word is generally taken in an evil sense, many do not make the proper distinction between a lawful rebellion against tyrants, and an unlawful one against lawful authority. As I said before, I do allow that rebellion against lawful magistrates is a most dam∣nable sin, which was of old most exemplarily punished in Ko<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ah and his company, who rebelled against Moses and in Sheba and Absalom, who rebelled against David. <HI>For to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for equity.</HI> Prov. xvii. 26. <HI>And they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.</HI> Rom. xiii. 2. So that this objection, brought from this place, as if the apostle was commanding their subjection, without resistance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o and such like tyrants as he, is very impertinent; and to explain this a little, I shall shew that the apostle was here vindicating christi∣anity from that reproach of casting off, or refu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing subjection to all magistrates, as if christian liberty had destroyed that religion, or that they were not to be subject to heathen magistrates; where upon, to undeceive them in this point he binds <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his duty of subjection to magistrates for conscience sake in general; and it is very considerable what Buchanan says in his book <HI>(De Jure regni:)</HI> that Paul did not write to the kings themselves because they were not christians, and therefore the more might be ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne with from them, though they should not understand the duty of magistrates. But upon supposition there had been some christi∣an king who had turned tyrant and a limited one also <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho by
<PB N="10" REF="017905_0006_0FA37A4D044B5D80"/>
his tyrannical proceedings, was endeavouring to overturn the laws, charters, and liberties of his subjects, what would he have written then? Surely if he had been like himself he would have denied that he should be owned for a king; and would have in∣terdicted all christian communion with him; and that they should account him no king, but such as they were to have no fellowship with according to the law of the gospel.</P>
<P>Second. The apostle here was, no doubt, speaking of law∣ful rulers, not tyrants; but of all such as are defined and quali∣fied here, being powers ordained of God, terrors to evil works, ministers of God for good. Yea, but say tories and their adhe∣rents, these are only motives of subjection to all powers, not qualifications of the powers. To which I answer, they are in∣deed motives, but such as can be extended to none but to those powers that are so qualified.</P>
<P>Third. He speaks of lawful powers indefinitely in the plural number, not specifying any kind or degree of them, as if only kings and emperors were here meant. It cannot be proved that the power of the sword is only in them, neither was there, at that time, at Rome a plurality of kings and emperors to be sub∣ject to. It is clear to me, that if he had meant the Roman em∣peror, he would have designed him in the singular number; for all the reasons of the text agree to inferior judges. Also, for they are ordained of God; they are called rulers in scripture, and God's ministers, revengers by office, who judge not for man but for the Lord. And inferior magistrates also are not to be resisted when doing their duty, 1 Peter, ii. 13. Yet all will al∣low, when they go beyond their bounds, and turn little tyrants, they may be withstood.</P>
<P>Fourth. He does not speak of Nero, concerning whom it cannot be proved, that at this time he had the sovereign power, at the famous and learned Mr. Prin shews; or if he had, that he was a tyrant at this time; and if he meant him at all, it was only as he was obliged to be by right, not as he was indeed: all men know, and none condemns the fact of the senate hat resist∣ed N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o at length, without transgreshing this precept. Yea, I should rather think the senate is the power that the apostle ap∣plies this text to, if he appled it to any in particular.</P>
<P>Fifth. The subjection here required is the same with the ho∣nour in the fifth command, where of this is an exposition, and is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ppostle to he contra ordinateness here condemned. Now sub∣jection takes in all the duties we owe to magistrates, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all the contraries forbidden; but unlimited obedience
<PB N="11" REF="017905_0006_0FA37A4D044B5D80"/>
is not here required, so neither unlimited subjection.</P>
<P>Third. I do allow passive subjection, in some cases, even to tyrants, when the Lord lays on that yoke; and, in effect, says he will have us lie under it awhile, as he of old commanded the Jews to be subject to Nebuchadnezzar. Of which passage, adduced to prove subjection to tyrants universally, Buchanan as above infers, that if all tyrants are to be subjected to because God by his prophet commanded his people to be subject to one tyrant, then it must be likewise concluded that all tyrants ought to be killed, because Ahab's house was commanded to be destroyed by Jehu. But passive subjection, when people are not in a capacity to resist, is necessary; but I do not say passive obedience, which is a mere chimera, invented in the brains of such sycophants and jack asses as would make the world slaves to tyrants. Whosoever suffereth, if he can shun it, is an enemy to his own being, and is a first cousin to a self-murderer; for every natural thing must strive to preserve itself against what annoyeth it; and also, he sins against the order of God who, in vain, hath ordained so many lawful means for the preservation of our being, if we suffer it to be de∣stroyed, having power to help it.</P>
<P>Fourth. I do abhor all war of subjects, professedly declared against a lawful king, who governs and rules according to law; as also all war against lawful authority, founded upon, or design∣ed for maintaining princ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ples inconsistent with government, or against policy and piety; yea all war without authority; yet when all authority of magistrates supreme and subordinate is per∣ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed and abused, contrary to the ends thereof, to the oppress∣ing of the people and overturning their laws and liberties, people must not in such cases, which was exactly ours, suspend or delay their resistance, waiting for the concurrence of men of authority, and neglect the duty in case of necessity, because they have not m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n of authority to lead them; for if the ground be lawful, the call clear, the necessity cogent, the capacity p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, they that have the law of nature, the law of God, and the fundamental laws of the land on their side, cannot want authority, although they may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of a king to lead them. Also, it is proper h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e to observe that people have this privilege of nature to de∣sent themselves, and their rights and liberties, as well as kings; and had it before they erected and constituted kings; for I affirm, that there is no distinction of quality in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of nature, though there be in civil order; but self defence is not an act of civil order, in such interest people must not depend upon the priority of their superiors, nor suspend the duties they owe to
<PB N="12" REF="017905_0007_0FA37A4DC5463840"/>
themselves and their neighbours, upon the manuduction of other mens greatness the law of nature allowing self defence, and the defence of our brethren, against all unjust violence, which fully justifies the conduct of the different states appearing in and flying to arms in defence of our distressed and injured brethren of the Massachusetts Bay state, in the year 1775, when Britain laid her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hand of tyranny and oppression upon them. It is a great and incumbent duty on all people to defend their religion and liberties, and those of their countrymen, against king <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> who shall attempt to destroy the rights and liberties of the subjects for all the power of a king or ruler is surely cumu∣lative, not privative, for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orse condition of a ruler ought not to be by producing. Why then shall the king, betraying his trust, wrong the cause of the people whose trustee be is? Nay if it were not lawful for people to defend their religion, lives, and liberties against the unjust encroachments of a tyrannical king, then I say the people would be in a worse situation with a king than without him, for they have done it before they had them, and so had better be without them still. But it is as clear as the sun at noon day in the firmament, that it is lawful to resist kings when they, by their mal administration, forfeit their subjects allegi∣ance, as the king of England, by his has surely done. Poor foul, I believe he repents, but it is like poor Esau's all too late.</P>
<P>Fifth. I do disallow all war, without real necessity and great wrongs sustained; and that it ought not to be declared or under∣taken upon supposed grounds, or pretended causes; and so the question is impertinently stated by the to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies, whether or not it be lawful for subjects, or a party of them, when they think them∣selves injured, or to be in a capacity, to resist or oppose the su∣preme power of a nation? For the question is not if, when they think themselves injured, they may resist; but when the injuries are real. Neither is it every reality of injuries will justify a people's re∣sistance; but when their dearest and nearest liberties are invaded, especially when such an invasion is made as threatens the total subversion of them. Nor do I say that a people, esteeming themselves in a capacity, or their being really in a capacity, doth make resistance a duty, except all alike they have a call, as well as a capacity, which requires real necessity, and a right to he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; and the things contended for to be real and legal. Rights really and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ally encroached upon their capacity, gives them only a convenience to go <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bout the duty that is previously lawful upon a moral ground. No man need to say who shall be judge the king or people.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="017905_0007_0FA37A4DC5463840"/>
For first. All who have eyes in their head may, I think, judge whether the sun shines or not; and all who have common sense may judge in this case; for when it comes to a necessity of resistance, it is to be supposed that the grievances complained of, and sought to be redressed by arms, are not hid, but mani∣fest. Now it cannot be so with a people only pretending their suffering wrong. As to the grievances of the good people of America, it is so manifest to the world, that some of the nati∣ons thereof have espoused our righteous cause, and the rest seems to be silent.</P>
<P>Second. There is no need of the formality of a judge in things evident to nature's eye, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s grass is not tyranny. Un∣dermining and overturning religion and liberty, must be na∣ture in the acts of necessitated resistance. In such a case is judge, party, accuser, witness, and all. Neither is it an act of judgment for people to defend their own. Defence is no act of jurisdiction, but a privilege of nature. Hence arises these common sayings, all laws permits force to be repelled by force; and the great and first law of nature allows self∣defence. I say, that the defence of life is necessary, and slows from the law of nature.</P>
<P>Third. Be judge who will, the tyrant cannot be judge in the case; for in those tyrannical acts that forces people to re∣sistance, he cannot be acknowledged as king, and of course no judge; for it is always supposed that the judge is absent when he is the party that does the wrong; as such, is inferior to the innocent.</P>
<P>Fourth and lastly. Let God be judge, and all the world take cognizance of the justness of our cause.</P>
<P>Sixth. I condemn all rising to revenge private injuries, whereby a country may be covered with blood, for some pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty wrongs done to some persons great of small. I also abhor all revengeful usurping of the magistrates sword, to avenge our∣selves for personal injuries, as David's ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing of Saul would have been. I Sam. xxiv. 10, 12, 13. Ibid xxvi. 9, 10. To object this, in this case, were very impertinent; for it would have been an act of offence, in a remote defence, if Saul had been immediately assaulting of him, it could▪ by no means, be deemed to have been lawful; and it would have been an act of private revenge, for a personal injury, and a sinful prevent∣ing of God's promise of David's succession, by a scandalous assassination; but it is clear then, David was resisting him and that is enough for my argument; and he supposes he might
<PB N="14" REF="017905_0008_0FA37A4E8393C580"/>
descend into battle and perish. I Sam. xxvi. 10. Not ex∣cluding but that he might perish in battle against himself re∣sisting. I do allow, indeed, that we are commanded, in scrip∣ture, not to resist evil, but whosoever shall smite us on the one cheek, to turn to him the other also. Mat v 39. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o recompence to no man evil for evil. Rom. xii. 17. But this doth not condemn self defence, and resisting of tyrants, vio∣lently endangering our lives, laws, religion, and liberties; but only resistance by way of private revenge and retaliation; and enjoins patience, when the clear call and dispensation do inevitably call unto suffering, but not to give way to all vio∣lence, to the subverting of religion and liberty. These texts do no more condemn private persons retaliating the magistrates than magistrates retaliating private persons; unless magi∣strates be exempted from this precept, and consequently be not among Christ's followers; yea, they do no more forbid private persons to resist the unjust violence of a king than to resist the unjust violence of any private person. That objec∣tion from our Lord's reproving Peter. Matt. xxvi. 3, 2. Put up thy sword for all they that take the sword shall perish by the sword. Hath no weight here, for this condemns only mak∣ing use of the sword either by way of private revenge, or usurping the use of it without authority, and so condemns all tyrants, which private subjects do not want to defend them∣selves, their religion, and liberty, or using it without necessity, which was not Peter's case, both because Christ was able to defend himself, and becase he was willing to deliver up him∣self. <HI>Pools synops critic in l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cum.</HI> Christ could easily have de∣fended himself, but he would not, and, therefore, in course there was not the least necessity for Peter's rashness. It con∣demns, also, a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ash precipitating, and preventing the call of God, to acts of resistance. But otherwise it is plain it was not Peter's fault to defend his master, but a necessary duty. The reason our blessed Lord gives for that inhibition at that time was twofold, one expressed Matt. xxvi. 52. For they that take the sword. &amp;c. Which do not belong to Peter, as if he was hereby threatened, but to those that were coming to take Christ. They it were that, indeed, usurped the sword of tyran∣nical violence, and therefore are threatened with destruction by the bloody sword of the Romans. So is that commination to be understood of anti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ist and the tyrants that serve him Rev. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 10. He that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Which really is a most terrible word against per∣secutors
<PB N="15" REF="017905_0008_0FA37A4E8393C580"/>
and tyrants. The reason is, John xviii. 11. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which my father hath given me shall I not drink. Which clearly repels that objection of Christ's non-resistance. To which it is answered, that suffering was the end of his volun∣tary suscepted humiliation, and his grand errand to the world, appointed by the father, and freely undertaken by himself, which is not the rule of our practice; though it be true that, even in his suffering, he left us an example, that we should follow his steps. 1 Pet. ii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1. In many things, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s he was a martyr, his sufferings were the purest rule and example for us to follow, both for the matter and frame of spirit, submission, patience, constancy, meekness, &amp;c. But not as he was our sponsor, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ter the same manner, for then it would be un∣lawful for us to flee, as well as to resist, because he would notifies at that time.</P>
<P>Seven. I do also disclaim all rising in arms for trifles of our own things, or small injuries done to ourselves, but in a case of pure necessity, for the preservation of our lives, religion, laws, and liberties, when all that is dear to us as men and christians, are in hazard. So I am not for rising in arms to force any people to be of any particular religion, but to de∣fend my own, and my country's religion and liberties, from unjust force and violence, against kings and tyrants, that may encroach thereon. I do not believe that it is the way that Christ hath appointed to propa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate religion by arms. Let persecutors and lambs of antichrist take that to them. But I am convinced that it is a privilege that Christ hath allowed to mankind, to defend and preserve their religion and liberties by arms, especially when they have been established by solemn charters, and the laws and constitution of the land, and there∣by become a land right, and the dearest and most precious of all rights and interest we have to contend for. It is true, faith Christ. John xviii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>6. My kingdom is not of this world; if it was of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews. But this objection, which is so much re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ied on by Quakers, and those who disown all use of war and arms, in any case whatsoever, will not conclude that Christ's kingdom is not to be defended and preserved by re∣sistance of all such who would impiously and sacrilegiously spoil <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of it in this world, because it is not of this world, for then all would be obliged to suffer it to be run down by slaves of hell and satan, and antichrists v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssals; yea, kings themselves, in such a case, must not fight for it, for they are among his ser∣vants.
<PB N="16" REF="017905_0009_0FA37A4FA94A8E80"/>
But the good confession he witnesses here before Pilate, is, that he hath a kingdom which, as it is not in opposition to any Cesarean majesty, must not be usurped by any king of clay; but is specially distinct from all the kingdoms of the world, and subordinate to no earthly power, being of a spiritual nature, whereof this is a demonstration, and sufficient security for earthly kingdoms, that his servants, as such, that is as christians and as ministers, were not appointed by him to pro∣pagate it by arms, not to deliver him their king, at that time, because he would not suffer his glorious design of redemption to be any longer retarded. But this doth not say that though they are not to propagate it as christians and as ministers, by carnal weapons, yet they may preserve it with such weapons as men. Hence that old saying may be vindicated, prayers and tears are the arms of the church. I grant they are so, the only best prevailing arms, and without which all others would be ineffectual, and that they, together with preaching and church discipline, are the only ecc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esiastical or spiritual arms of a church as a church; but the members thereof are also men, and as men they may use the same weapons as others do. And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, faith the Lord. Ezek xxxiii 31. And from this I shall take an argu∣ment, that if it be lawful for private subjects to resist a tyrant by prayers and tears, than it is lawful also to resist them by vio∣lence; but the former is true, therefore the latter. This per∣sonal resistance by violence is as consistent with that command, Rom. xiii. 1, 2. Let every soul be subject unto the higher pow∣ers. Whosoever, therefore, resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God; as resistance by prayer is with that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Tim. ii. 1, 2. I exhort that supplication be made for kings and for all that are in authority. If the king be good, the one resistance is as unlawful as the other; and is a sinful resistance of the ordi∣nance of God, to pray against him no less than the other to fight against him. Therefore, when a king turns a tyrant, and a destroyer of the religion and liberties of the people, I may not pray for him, except conditionally, but against him as an enemy, so I may also fight against him. As such the tyrant of Britain, I mean George the III, and his burning bloo∣dy emissaries, who do, at least, by their actions, acknow∣ledge that the resistance made against them, by the prayers and tears of the faithful, is more powerful and effectual than that made by arms. Witness the spite and enmity they have shewn in all their tours of plunder and burnings, against the houses dedicated and set apart for prayers and praises to Almighty
<PB N="17" REF="017905_0009_0FA37A4FA94A8E80"/>
God. What has become of one or two near Springfield, in the state of New-Jersey, when they murdered the minister's wife there? How have they destroyed two at Somerset, in said state? Also, at Crumpond, and Bedford in the state of New-York? And no doubt many more that at present does not occur to my mind. And farther, the law used to make the one resistance as treasonable as the other, and that very deservedly too, when the king was doing his duty. But when he turns tyrant, nei∣ther of those methods of resistance can justly be condemned.</P>
<P>These things being admitted, I shall now come to the thing in hand, and endeavour to prove this truth, that it is a neces∣sary duty for a people to endeavour, in the defence of their re∣ligion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ves, laws and liberties; to resist and repr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss the tyran∣ny of a king, using and abusing his power for subverting religion, invading the liberties, and overturning the fundamental laws of the country. I propose to be as short as possible, because I think this truth insufficiently confirmed already, to convince any but these who are determined not to be convinced; yet I propose to hint at some others, and prosecute them in the following order. First, I shall produce some arguments from the law of nature and nations. Secondly, From the common practices of all christian people. Thirdly, From express scriptures.</P>
<P>First, The arguments of the first class are very multifarious. I shall endeavour to reduce them to a few as compendiously as may be, and only give the strength of them in a syllogistical form, without expatiating, save where the matter requires.</P>
<P>First, The great antagonists of this truth, through the clear∣ness thereof, are forced to assert and grant such particulars as will, by consequence, justify this plea. First, Barclay, <HI>contra monarchum,</HI> is cited by the <HI>Apal Relat,</HI> and <HI>Jus Populi,</HI> asserting, <Q>That if a king will alienate, and subject his kingdom, without his subjects consent, or be carried with a hostile mind to the destruction of his people, his kingdom is actually lost, and the people may not only lawfully resist, but also de∣pose him.</Q> <HI>Grotius de jure Belli, lib.</HI> 1. <HI>cap</HI> 4. asserts the same, and adds, 'If he but attempt to do so, he may be resisted.' The Surveyor of Naphtali grants the same. P. 23. 24. Yea, this has been granted in many of the councils and open courts of christian nations, that in case of the king's alienating his kingdom, he may be resisted; which will fully justify the Ame∣rican resistance; for surely Britain, by her conduct, was about to sell or destroy her liberties and property; and has effectually estranged and drawn off our affections from her, even to the world's wonder. I need say no more than this, that a king's
<PB N="18" REF="017905_0010_0FA37A50054E4E90"/>
carrying a hostile mind, to the destruction of his people and kingdom, does give the people a right to resist him. Doctor Ferne acknowledgeth, <Q>That personal defence is lawful against the sudden, illegal, and inevitable assaults of the kings messen∣gers, or of himself, so far as to ward off his blows, or hold his hands; as also he alloweth private persons liberty to deny subsidies and tribute to the prince, when he employeth it to the destruction of the commonwealth.</Q> From hence I argue, if one may defend himself against the sudden, illegal and inevita∣ble assaults of the king or his messenger▪ then may many men, in defence of their lives and liberties, defend themselves against the surprizing massacre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and sudden assaults of the king of Eng∣land and his bloody emissaries, which were all illegal; but the former is true, therefore the latter.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>Bodin de Repub. lib.</HI> 2. chap. 5. granteth, <Q>If a king turn tyrant, he may lawfully, at his subjects request, be invaded, resisted, condemned, or slain by a foreign prince</Q>—Hence, if a foreign prince may lawfully help a people opp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ssed by their own sovereign, then people may resist themselves, if they be able; but the former is true, therefore the latter. The con∣sequence cannot be denied, for foreigners have no more power or au∣thority over another sovereign, than the people have themselves.</P>
<P>Fourth, <HI>Arnisaeus de author Pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i.</HI> chap. 2. 10. Grante<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, <Q>That if the king proceed extrajudically without order of law, by violence, every private man hath power to resist</Q> So the Surveyor of Naphtali, as above, grants, <Q>So much of a womans violently resi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting attempts against the honour of her chastity, and tending to ensnare he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in sin, whereof her n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>resi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ance makes her guilty.</Q> Hence. If every extrajudical violence of a prince may be resi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted, then also all contrajudical violence against law or reason, must be opposed, for that is more grievous, and all their violences, wherein they do not act as judges, must be resist∣ed and that is altogether, for in none of them they can act as judges; but the former is true, therefore the latter. If a woman may defend her chastity against the king, lest her non-resistance make her guilty, then may a nation, or any part of it, resist a king's attempt upon their religion and liberties, enticing them to fornication, lest their non resistance make them guilty; but the former is true▪ therefore the latter.</P>
<P>Five, That same <HI>Arnisaeus,</HI> cap. 4. saith of the former, to wit, <Q>He who is called a tyrant in title, it is determined by all, without any difficulty, that he may be lawfully repulsed, <HI>or</HI> if by force he be gotten into the throne, he may warrantably be then<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e removed, because he hath not any jot of power which is
<PB N="19" REF="017905_0010_0FA37A50054E4E90"/>
not illegitimate, and unto which resistance is forbidden, for the fear of God and for conscience sake; and therefore he is no further to be looked at than as an enemy</Q></P>
<P>Sixth. <HI>Grotious de jure belli</HI> lib i. cap. 4. Granteth, <Q>the law of not resisting does not bind, when the danger is most weighty and certain;</Q> and I do not plead for it in any other case. And further, he faith, <Q>the law of non-resistance seemeth to have flowed from them who first combined together into so∣ciety, and from whom such as did command, did derive their power. Now if it had been asked of such whether they would chose to die, rather than in any case to resist the superior with arms, I know not if they would have yielded thereto, unless with this addition, if they could not be resisted but with the greatest perturbation of the common wealth, and destruction of many innocents. And afterwards he hath the words, Never∣theless I scarce dare condemn every one, or the lesser part, which may only be done, at utmost extremity; notwithstand∣ing respect is to be had to the common good</Q> From all which I need not make the least inference, the concession is so large, that it does to all intents and purposes confirm my arguments.</P>
<P>Seventh. The surveyor of Naphtali, in the place above cited, <Q>grants legal self-defence, against the sovereign, by way of plea in court, for safety of a man's person or estate; as also is the case of most habited not our and compleat tyranny, against law to the destruction of the body of a people; and of all known legal liberties, and the being of religion, according to law, and in case of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not being in his right wits.</Q></P>
<P>Hence I argue, that if it be lawful to resist the king by a plea in law, for an estate, yea the law will allow, by actual force if he come to take possession of it illegally; then it must be law∣for their lives and estates, liberties and religion, to resist him by force, when the legal resistance is not admitted; but the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmer is true therefore the latter. The reason of the connexion is, the municipal law permits the one, and the law of na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> and nations, which no municipal law can infringe, will warrant the other. He hath no more right to be both judge and party in this case, than in the other. Second. If it be lawful to resist tyranny a∣gainst law, to the destruction of the rights of the people, their re∣ligion and liberties, then I want no more to prove the lawfulness of the American resistance against the tyranny of Britain, exerci∣sed for years past against us, which has proven the desolation and ruin of many hundreds of families, besides all the rivers of blood that have been drawn from the veins of our dear country men;
<PB N="20" REF="017905_0011_0FA37A50C24F3F60"/>
and all this perpetrated for the profest purpose of subverting our religion and liberties, and to establish an arbitrary government. And here I think it proper to answer an objection that some may make, viz. That I have blended religious liberty with civil, as a cause of the American resistance, when the former was not in the least invaded by any British act of parliament that was com∣plained of; but all freedom left to the conscience in that respect, and therefore I ought not to have made use of the word in this piece. In answer whereof, I offer the following as my reason for so doing: I do freely acknowledge that I have not seen or heard of any British act of parliament that did, in direct terms, and in so many words, declare that the people of America should all be of one uniform religion, upon pain of death and confiscation of goods; but I have seen and read one that carried all that in it's bowels, to wit. The declaratory act, wherein they declare they had a right to bind the Americans in all cases whatsoever; which if once they could have put into full execution, what would there be left we could call our own any longer than at the will and pleasure of a tyrannical king and parliament, for there is no ex∣ception in the word whatsoever? Besides, whoever knew or heard of a people's enjoying their religious liberties when their civil was taken from them? They were born twins, knit together, therefore if-one of them dies, the other cannot live; at least this is my opinion, and every one has a right to judge for themselves. Now under the full conviction of this, and that had our civil li∣berties been taken from us, our religious ones would not long survived. I was led to blend them together, and shall through∣out this piece.</P>
<P>Third. Suppose the king should run mad, and out of his wits, and then should run upon an innocent man to kill him, or make an attempt to cut his own throat, would it then, and in that case, be lawful to resist him? Yea, it would be a great sin not to do it. Then surely, when in a mad rage, he is seeking to destroy many hundred of the good people of America, he may and ought to be resisted. But the former is true therefore the latter. It is easily to be seen by the above concessions of adversaries to my principles, that the absolute subjection they talk of will not hold good, nor the prerogative be so uncontroulable in every case as they would pretend; and that in many cases the safety of the people hath the supremacy above it, and that also in these cases the people must be judges whether they may resist or not.</P>
<P>Second. From the law of nature I may argue. First. If God the fountain of all power, and author of all right, hath gi∣ven
<PB N="21" REF="017905_0011_0FA37A50C24F3F60"/>
unto man both the power, and the right of, and reason to manage self-defence, and hath no ways interdicted it in his word, to be put forth against tyrants, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n it is duty to use it against him upon occasion; but the former is true, therefore the latter. Second. If this power and right were restrained in man against the unjust violence of any, it would either be by policy or grace, or some express prohibition in the word of God; but none of these can be said, therefore policy cannot destroy nature, but is rather cumulative to it. A man entering into a politic incorpo∣ration, does not lose the privilege of nature. If one particular nature may defend itself against destroying violence out of socie∣ty, then must many of these natures, combined in society have the same right; and so much the more that their relative duties superadd an obligation of mutual assistance. Grace does not re∣strain the right of sinless nature, though it restrains corruption. But self-defence is no corruption. Grace makes a man more a man than he was, and nothing can be more dishonourable to the gospel than that, by the law of nature, it is lawful to resist ty∣rants. But we are bound by religion from withstanding their cruelty. The laws of God do not interfere one with an∣other. Third. That law which alloweth comparative <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re of∣fending, so as to kill rather than be killed, teache<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> resistance. But so the law of nature alloweth, except we be guilty of mur∣der, in the culpable omission of self defence. The reason is be∣cause the love of self is nearer and greater, as to temporal life, than the love of our neighbour; that being the measure of this, therefore it obliges rather to kill than be killed, the exigence of necessity so requiring. Fourth. If nature put no other differ∣ence between the violence of a tyrant than of another man, then it teaches to resist both alike; but it putte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h no difference, but rather aggravates that of a tyrant, being the violence of a man, the injustice of a member of the common wealth, and the cruelty of a tyrant; and it is most absurd to say, that we might defend ourselves from the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er violence, and not from the greater. Fifth. If particular nature must yield to the good of universal nature, then must one man, though in greatest power, be resisted rather than the universal common wealth suffer hurt. But the former is true therefore the latter; for that dictates the necessity of the distracted father to be bound by his own sons, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t all the family be hurt; therefore the greatest of men, or kings, when destructive to the common wealth, must be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is but one man, and so but particular nature▪ Sixth▪ That which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and reflects upon p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce, as putting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in a
<PB N="22" REF="017905_0012_0FA37A5183E7D120"/>
worse condition than brutes, is absurd and contrary to the law of nature; but to say that the brutes have power to defend them∣selves, by resisting what annoys them, and deny this power to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aen, is irrational, and reflects upon providence as putting men in a worse condition than brutes; therefore it is absurd and con∣trary to the law of nature.</P>
<P>Third. From the institution of government, I may argue thus, that power and government, which is not of God, may be resisted. The tyrant's power and government in breaking char∣ters, overturning laws, subverting religion, oppressing subjects, is not of God, therefore it may be resisted. This is clear, be∣cause that is only the reason why he is not to be resisted, because the ordinance of God is not to be resisted. Rom. xiii. 2. But they resisting a man, destroying all the interests of mankind, do not in this resist the ordinance of God. And if it were not so, this would tend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>remedables<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly to overthrow all po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cs, and open a gap to all disorder. Injustice and cruelty would give as great encouragement to tyrants to do what they list, as thieves would be encouraged, if they knew that nobody would resist them, or b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing them to punishment.</P>
<P>Fourth. From the original constitution of government by men, it may be argued thus, if people, at the first erection of go∣vernment, acted rationally and did not put themselves in a worse <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase than before, wherein it was lawful to defend themselves a∣gainst all injuries, but devolved their rights upon the fiduciary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>utory of such as should remain still in the rank of men, that can do wrong, who had no power but by their gift, consent, and choice, with whom they associated, not to their detriment, but for their advantage; and determined the form of their govern∣ment, and time of its continuance, and in what cases they might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cur to their primeval liberty and settled a succession to have course, not by hereditary right, but by right and force of law for good ends; then they did not give away their birth right of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lf defence and power of resistance, which they had before to withstand the violence▪ injuries, and oppressions of men they set over them, when they pervert the form, and convert it to tyran∣ny; but did re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain a power and privilege <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sist and revolt from them, and repel their violence when they should do violence to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> constitution, and pervert the ends thereof. But the former <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> true, ergo, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>exion is confirmed from this. If the e∣states of a kingdom give the power to a king, it is their own power in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; and if they give it for their own good, they have power to judge when it is used against themselves and
<PB N="23" REF="017905_0012_0FA37A5183E7D120"/>
for their evil; and so power to limit and to resist the power that they gave.</P>
<P>Fifth. From the way and manner of erecting governors, by compact, the necessity whereof is clear, many arguments might be deduced. I shall reduce them to this form, if people must propose conditions unto kings to be by them acqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in, and submitted unto, at their admission to the government, which thereupon becomes the fundamental laws of the government, and security for the peoples rights and liberties, giving a law claim to the people to pursue the king, in case of fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing in the main and principle thing covenanted, as their own covenanted manda∣tarius, who hath no right or authority of his own, but what he hath from them, and no more power but what is contained in the conditions upon which he undertaketh the government. Then whenever a tyrant doth break all these conditions, which he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce accepted, and so become, in strict law, no king and the people be, in strict law, liberated from subjection to him, they may and must defend themselves, and their fundamental rights and privi∣leges, religion and laws, and resist the tyranny overturning them. But the former is true, therefore, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Sixth. From the nature of magistracy, it may be argued thus: That power which is properly neither parental nor merital, nor masterly and despotick over the subjects and goods▪ but only fi∣duciary, and by way of trust, is more to be resisted than that which is properly so. But that power which is properly so, that is parental power and marital and masterly, may be resisted in many cases Therefore that power which is not so properly, but only fiduciary, is more to be resisted than a king's power o∣ver his subjects, is neither parental nor marital, &amp;c. is most clear. The minor is clear, by instances. First. If children may in case of necessity, resist the fury and mad rage of their father, seeking to destroy them, then must private subjects resist the rage and tyranny of kings, seeking to destroy them, and what is dear∣est to them; for there i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no stricter obligation moral between king and people, than between parents and children, nor so strict; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> tyrants and people there is none at all, therefore the former ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be denied. Second. If wives may lawfully de∣fend themselves against the unjust violence of enraged husbands, then m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> subjec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s have power to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the furious assaults of enraged tyran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, for there is not so great a tie betwixt them and people▪ as be w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n man and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e; yea there is none at all; but the former i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> true. Ergo, Three. If servants may defend themselves against their masters, then m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st private subjects against
<PB N="24" REF="017905_0013_0FA37A52430B0998"/>
a tyrant or his emissaries; but the former is true. Ergo, Four. If the king's power is only fiduciary, and by way of pawn, which he hath got to keep, then when that power is manifestly abused, to the hurt of them that entrusted him with it, he ought, by all means, to be resisted by all those which he undertook to protect; but the former is true, therefore the latter.</P>
<P>Seventh. From the limited power of kings it may be thus argued: If kings be limited by laws and contracts, and may be resisted by pleas in law, and have no absolute power to do and command what they will▪ but must be limited both by the laws of God and man, and cannot make what laws they will, in prejudice of the people's rights, nor execute the laws made according to their pleasure▪ nor confer on others a lawless license to oppress whom they please; then when they turn tyrants▪ and arrogate a lawless absoluteness, and cross the rules and transgress the bounds prescribed by God's laws and man's laws, and made their own lusts a law, and execute the same arbitrarily, they must be resist∣ed by force when a legal resistance cannot be had, in defence of religion and liberty. But all kings are limited, &amp;c and the con∣nexion may be thus confirmed in short: That power which is not the ordinance of God, may be resisted; but an absolute illi∣mited power crossing the rules and transgressing the bounds pre∣scribed by God's law and man's, is not the ordinance of God, therefore it may be resisted.</P>
<P>Eighth. Further from the rules of government it may be ar∣gued several ways. First. That power which is contrary to law, evil and tyrannical, can tie none to subjection; but if it oblige to any thing, it ties to resistance. But the power of a king against law, religion, and liberty, is a power contrary to law, evil and tyrannical, therefore, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The major is plain, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or wickedness can tie no man but to resist it. That power which is contrary to law, evil and tyrannical is wickedness. Second. That power and those acts, which neither king can exercise nor command, nor others execute, nor any o∣bey▪ must certainly be resisted; but such is the power and acts that oppress the subjects, and overturn religion and liberty, there∣fore, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The minor is evident from scripture, condemning oppression and violence, both in them that command and in them that ex∣ecute the same▪ and also them that obey such wicked commands. The major is very clear from reason, both because such power and such acts as cannot be commanded cannot be executed, can∣not be obeyed lawfully, are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ful and wicked; and because it
<PB N="25" REF="017905_0013_0FA37A52430B0998"/>
cannot be a magistratical power, for that may always be exercis∣ed and executed lawfully; and what a man cannot command, the resisting of that he cannot punish; but acts of oppression a∣gainst law, religion, and liberty, a man cannot command, ergo the resisting of these he cannot punish. Third. That govern∣ment and administration which is not subordinate to the law and will of God, who hath appointed it, must be resisted. But that government, or administration, which under mines or overturns religion and liberty, is not subordinate to the law and will of God, therefore, &amp;c. The major is clear, for nothing but what is the ordinance of God, subordinate to his law and will, is irresist∣able. Rom. xiii. 2. The assumption is undeniable.</P>
<P>Ninth. From the very end and true design of government, which must be acknowleged by all to be the glory of God and the good of mankind; yea all that have been either wise or ho∣nest have always held that the safety of the people is the supreme law. The argument may run thus in short. First. That doc∣trine which makes the holy one to cross his own ends, in giving governors, must be absurd and unchristian, as well as irrational; but such is the doctrine that makes all kings, and tyrants irresist∣able upon any pretence whatever; which, by the bye, is the an∣cient and modern to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y doctrine, ergo the the minor. I prove that doctrine which makes God, intending his own glory, and the peo∣ples good, to give governors both as fathers to preserve and as mur∣derers to destroy them, must make the holy one to cross his own ends, for these are contradictory; but the doctrine that makes all kings and tyrants irresistable, &amp;c. is such, for by office they are fathers to preserve, and by office also they must be murderers, vest∣ed with such a power from God by the first act. If they be irresist∣able when they do so, seeing every power that is irresistable is the ordinance of God. Hence also when a blessing turns a curse it is no more the ordinance of God, but to be resisted with all our might and strength; but when a king turns a tyrant, overturning religion and liberty, then a blessing turns a curse, therefore▪ &amp;c.</P>
<P>Second. Means are to be resisted when they are not useful for, but destructive to the ends for which they were appointed; but kings overturning religion and liberty, are means not useful for, but destructive to the ends for which they were ap∣pointed. Seeing then they are neither for the glory of God nor the good of mankind, therefore, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Third. If all powers and prerogatives of men are only means appointed for▪ and should vail unto the supreme law of the peoples safety, and all laws be subordinate to and corroborative
<PB N="26" REF="017905_0014_0FA37A5303AFB5D8"/>
of this law; and when cross to it, are in so far null, and no laws; and all law formalities in competion with it are to be laid aside, and all parliamentary priviledes must yield to this, and king and parliament, both conspiring, have no power against it; and no sovereign power, by virtue of any resignation from the people can comprize any authority to act against it; then it is duty to obey the supreme law, in resisting all powers and prero∣gatives, all laws and law formalities, and all conspiracies what∣soever against this supreme law, the safety of the people; but the former is true, therefore, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Fourth. That power which is obliged and appointed to com∣mand and rule justly and religiously, for the good of the people, and is only set over them on these conditions, and for that end, cannot tie them to subjection, without resistance, when the power is abused to the destruction of laws, religion, liberty, and people; but all power is so appointed and obliged, therefore whensoever it is so abused▪ it cannot tie people to subjection, but rather oblige them to the rejection of it.</P>
<P>Tenth. From the obedience required to government it may be argued thus: First. If we may flee from tyrants then we may resist them; but we may flee from tyrants therefore we may resist them. The connexion I prove, First. If all grounds of justice will warrant the one as well as the other, then, if the one be duty so is the other; but the former is true; for the same justice and equity that warrants declining a tyrants unjust violence by flight, will warrant resistance when flight will not do it; the same principle of self defence that makes flight duty, when resistance is not possible, will also make resistance duty when flight is not possible; the same principle of charity to wives and children, that makes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>light lawful when, by resistance, they cannot avoid tyran∣ny, will make resistance duty when by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>light they cannot evita<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e it; the same principle of conscience to keep religion free, that prompts to flight when resistance will not save it, will also prompt to resist it when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>light is not practicable. Second. If to flee from a just power when, in justice we are obnoxious to its sword, be to resist the ordinance of God, and so sin, then to flee from an unjust power must be also a resisting of the abusing of it, and so duty, for the one is resistance as well as the other; but the difference of the power resisted makes the one lawful, the other not. Again, if kingly power may be resisted, by interposing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eas, and miles, why not by the same rule by interposing walls and arms? Both is resistance, for against a lawful king or magis∣trate that would be resistance. Third. If a tyrant hath irresistable
<PB N="27" REF="017905_0014_0FA37A5303AFB5D8"/>
power to kill and destroy the people, he hath also irresistable power to cite and summon them before him; and if it be unlaw∣ful to resist his murders, it must be as unlawful to resist his sum∣mons. Fourth. For a community of people to flee with wives and children, strong and weak, young and old, to escape tyrannical violence, and leave the land, were more unlawful than to resist, Alas! where should or could we of America have fled to have escaped the power of tyranny? Therefore it was ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> duty to resist, for what is not possible as a natural means of preser∣vation, is not a lawful mean; but this was not a possible mean, neither is it warranted in nature's law, or God's word▪ for a peo∣ple that have God's right, and man's law, to the land, and the rights and liberties thereof, to leave the country and its liberties all into the hands of a tyrant, and his crew. And farther, if it is duty to disobey, 'tis also duty to resist tyrants in defence of re∣ligion and liberty. But it is duty to disobey them, therefore, &amp;c. The connection only will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck at, which is thus strengthened, if subjection be no more pressed in scripture than obedience. Then, if non obedience be duty, non subjection must be so also, and consequently resistance; but subjection is no more pressed in scripture than obedience, for all commands of subjection, to the higher powers as God's ministers, under pain of damnation, do only respect lawful magistrates, and in lawful things, and do include obedience; and non-obedience to the power so qualified is a resisting of the ordinance of God, as well as non subjection. If then obedience to magistrates be duty, and non-obedience sin, and obedience to tyrants sin, and non obe∣dience duty, then, by parity of reason, subjection to magistrates is duty, and non-subjection is sin; and also subjection to tyrants is sin▪ and non subjection duty.</P>
<P>Eleventh. From the resistance allowed in all governments, it may be argued thus:—If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be duty to defend our religion, lives and liberties, against an invading army of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut throats, Turks, Tar∣tars, &amp;c. without or against the king's warrant, then of course, it is and must be duty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o defend the same against home b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed ty∣rants, except we would subscribe ourselves home born slaves; but the former is true, therefore, &amp;c. The minor cannot be doubt∣ed, because the king's power cannot be p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ative and destructive to defence of our religion, lives, and liberties; nor neither can it take away nature's birth right, to defend th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se or make it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the worse than if we had no king at all. Now if we had no king at all, we might defend these against invaders; and whether we have king's or not, we are under moral obligations of the law of
<PB N="28" REF="017905_0015_0FA37A53C3AAC820"/>
God to endeavour the defence of these. But this need not be insisted on; the connexion of the proposition is clear, if king's be more tyrannical, in invading religion and liberty themselves, than in suffering others to do it, or hindering them to be oppos∣ed; and if their invasion be more tyrannical, hurtful, and dan∣gerous, than the invasion of strangers, then, if it be duty to resist strangers, invading these interests, it is more duty to resist home bred tyrants invading the same; but the former is true, there∣fore the latter. Resistance in the one case is no more resisting the ordinance of God than in the other.</P>
<P>Twelfth. From the motives of resistance we may draw this argument, which might indeed be branched out into several; but for brevities sake, I propose to reduce it to this complex one: If when we are in a capacity we cannot acquit ourselves in the duty that we do owe to our country▪ ourselves, and posterity, and absolve ourselves from the sin and judgment of tyrants, who overturn religion and liberty, oppress our countrymen, im∣pose slavery on ourselves, and intail it upon posterity, by a pas∣sive subjection, submission to, and not opposing these mischiefs, then this instance is necessary; but the former is true, therefore, &amp;c. The connexion is clear, for there cannot be a medium, if we cannot discharge these duties by subjection, submission, and not opposing; then, we must do them by non subjection, non sub∣mission▪ and opposing, since they must be done some way. The assumption is thus confirmed Second. The duties we owe to religion, when it is like to be overturned, which no doubt would have been the case had our civil liberties been taken from us, it is, I say, in this case, our duty to resist tyranny, by making use of defensive arms. This must surely be as necessary as that of our civil liberties, which is an interest of our bodies, which is, indeed far inferior, and as necessary a duty as to defend our civil liberties from perpetual slavery, and as preferable thereunto as Christ's interests is to man's; and as the true end of all self preservation is to the means of it, the preservation of religion being the end of all self preservation. But this duty cannot be discharged without resistance in a mere passive subjection and sub∣mission, otherwise the same might be discharged in our universal submission to Turks or Indians, coming to destroy our religion. Surely this passive way of conducting ourselves cannot answer the duty of pleading for truth. Isa. ix. 4. Seeking the truth. Jer. v. 1. Being valliant for it. Jer. lix. 3. Making up the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edge, standing in the gap, &amp;c. Ezek. xxii. 30. Which yet are really necessary and incumbent duties according to our capacity;
<PB N="29" REF="017905_0015_0FA37A53C3AAC820"/>
therefore we cannot answer the duties we owe to religion, in a mere passive way. I say farther, the duty we owe to our coun∣trymen, and to those of each state, is to assist and defend them, and relieve them when oppressed, which fully and compleatly ju∣stifies the conduct of all those brave officers and men who so chear∣fully flew from their ploughs to the sword, to the relief of our brave, but oppressed brethren at Boston, in the year 1775, as truly we were bound, by all laws of humanity, and of God, to do; and by the royal law of Christ, the foundation of all righteousness among men, towards each other. Matt. vii. 12. All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them. Reader, never let this direction slip your memory, for surely as we would wish to have others help us, when we are oppressed, so should we do to them when it is in the power of our hands to do it, and not forbear to deliver them, for the Lord will require their blood at our hand. Prov. xxiv, 11, 12 But this cannot, by any means, be done by a mere subjection without resistance. Third. There is no way to free ourselves of the sin and judg∣ment of tyrants, by mere passive subjection. We find in the sacred scriptures, how that the people of old have been involved and punished for the sins of tyrants, as the people of Judah for Manasseh. 2 Kings xxi. 11. &amp;c. Jer. xv. 4. Whose sins, if they had not been committed, the judgment for them had been prevented▪ and if the people had hindred them, they had not smarted, but being jointly included with their rulers in the same bond of fidelity to God, and made accountable as joint princi∣ples with their kings for that debt, by their mutual as well as se∣veral engagements, to walk in his ways, they were liable to be punished for their rebellion and apostacy, because they did not hinder it. Hence I say, resistance against tyrants and tyranny is right and lawful, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Secondly. This truth is confirmed from the common prac∣tice of the people of God, even under persecution, from whence I propose to draw an argument from some notable examples which, to condemn, were impious, and to deny were most impu∣dent; and, for forms sake, it may run thus: What the people of God under both testaments have frequently done, in time of persecution, for defending, vindicating, or recovering their reli∣gion and liberties, may and ought to be done again in the like circumstances, when these are in the like hazard; but under both testaments, the people of God frequently, in times of persecuti∣on, have defended, vindicated, and recovered their religion and liberties by defensive arms, resisting the sovereign powers that
<PB N="30" REF="017905_0016_0FA37A54823DAB60"/>
sought to destroy them; therefore this may, and ought to be done again when these religious, civil and natural privileges are in the like hazard to be destroyed by the violent encroachments of the sovereign powers. The proposition cannot be denied, ex∣cept by all such as are open professed enemies to the people of God, as I take all the enemies to their country really to be. And I am ready to believe that, by an impartial and strict <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ernt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y, it will be found that the examples of their endeavoured resistance will be little inferior, if not superior, in number and importance to the examples of their submissive sufferings in all ages of the world, which will appear in the probation of the assumption by adduction of many instances which I shall only cursorily glean out of that plentiful harvest that histories do afford us, both of ancient and modern date.</P>
<P>First. I need only just touch on that most well known and famous history of the Maccabees, of undoubted verity, though not of cannonical authority, in which, according to scripture pre∣dictions, we have a most notable account of many heroick enter∣prises, atchievements, and exploits performed by them that knew their God, and tendered his glory and their religion and country's liberties, above the common cate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>k no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us of uncontroul∣able, irresistable royalty and ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>te, implicit, loyalty, that have abused the world in all ages. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we have an account of the noble and successful re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ance of a party of a few godly and zeal∣ous patriots, without the concurrence of civil authority, or coun∣tenance of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or nobles of the kingdom, against a king universally acknowledged and subjected unto, that came in pea∣ceably and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the kingdom by flatteries, with whom the greatest part▪ and those of the greatest note, took part and did wicked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> the covenant and nation's interest, and were corr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> by flatteries; yet a few priests, with the assistance of some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> countrymen, did fly to arms against him and them, and the Lord did wonderfully assist them for a considerable time, as was foretold by Daniel xi. And all this did fall out under the persecution of Antiochus Epip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anes, and was happily begun by Matthias▪ a godly priest and his five sons, who being commanded under severe certifications, to worship according to the law then and at that time in force, and according to the king's wicked lust<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. However they refused, and did most valiantly resist that most horrible abomination, and flew to defensive arms, which, while living, he patronized, and when dying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id encourage his sons to it by a notable oration, shewing them what a deplorable ease hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> country was in, and what a duty and dignity it was to redee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="31" REF="017905_0016_0FA37A54823DAB60"/>
and deliver it; and this was vigorously prosecuted by Judas Maccab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, expressly for the quarrel of religion and liberty, a∣gainst the mighty tyrant and all his emissaries. A great under∣taking indeed. And have not we of America great reason to bless God, and to stand amazed at the great goodness and pro∣vidence of God, that when the king of Great-Britain, and his venal parliament, was about to destroy our civil, and of course, our religious liberties, that he raised us up a second Matthias, even the great WASHINGTON, as an instrument in his hands to save this land from ruin and slavery; who has, by his great ge∣neralship, rendered himself a world's wonder and a wonder to the world. But nothing is too hard or impossible with God, who always fits and furnishes instruments suitable to the work he has to do.</P>
<P>Second. To come down to the history of the gospel dispen∣sation, I allow indeed that in the time of the primitive persecuti∣ons, under the heathen emperors, this great and well approved privilege of se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> defence was not much improved or made use of by christians, who studied more to play the martyrs than to play the men as christian soldiers; because▪ at that time, the Lord was pleased, in his good providence, to spirit them up, and call them unto, and accept of their hands passive testimonies, while they were incorporate under a civil relation with the heathens, in subjection to governors, who did not, by open tyranny over∣turn their civil liberties; but did only endeavour to eradicate religion, which, at that time, had never become their right by law, while they were scattered▪ and out of capacity, and never could come to a separate formed community, by joint concur∣rence and correspondence, to undertake a declared resistance, while religion was only propagating through the nations, and the Lord did providentially preclude the least appearance that might be of propagating of it by any armed and formed force, being the gospel of peace, designed to save and not to destroy; yet even then▪ and in that case, there were instances of christians resisting their enemies, and rescuing of their ministers, &amp;c. as they are found on record. First. How some inhabiting Marcota with force rescued Dionysius of Alexandria out of the hands of such as were carrying him away, about the year of our Lord 255. Second. How about the year 310 the Armenians waged war against Maximus, who was come against them with an army, because of their religion. Third. About the year 342 the citizens of Athanasius their minister, against G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gorious, and Sy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ianus the emperor's captain, who came with strong
<PB N="32" REF="017905_0017_0FA37A55A4777AD0"/>
force to put him in. Fourth. How about the year 356 the people of Constantinople did, in like manner, stand to the de∣fence of Paulus against Constan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ius the emperor, and killed his Captain Hermogenes; and afterwards, in great multitudes, they opposed the intrusion of the heretick Macedonius. Fifth. How when a wicked edict was sent forth to pull down the churches of such as were for the clause of one substance, the christians that maintained that testimony resisted the bands of soldiers that were procured at the emperors command, by Macedonius, to force the Mantinians to embrace the Arian heresy, but the christians at Mantinium kindled with an earnest zeal towards the christian religion, went against the soldiers with chear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul minds, and val∣liant courage, and made a great slaughter of them. Sixth. How about the year 387 the people of Cesa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea did defend Basil their minister. Seventh. How for fear of the people, the Lieutenant of the emperor Vallens durst not execute those eighty priests who had come to supplicate the emperor, and was commanded to be all killed by him. Eighth. How the inhabitants of Mount Ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ia espoused By<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il's quarrel, and assaulted the Lieutenant, and forced his guards to flee. Ninth. How about the year 404, when the emperor had banished Chry<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ostom, the people flocked together, so that the emperor was necessitated to call him back again from his exile. Tenth. How the people resisted also the transportation of Ambrose by the command of Valentinian the emperor, and chused rather to lose their lives than to suffer their pastor to be taken away by the soldiers. Eleventh. How the christians, oppressed by Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s king of Persia, did flee to the Romans to seek their help, and Theodosius the emperor is much praised for the war; (which, by the bye, fully justifies the Americans seeking relief from France, from the cruel ty∣ranny of Britain, and of Louis XVI for granting of it, by which conduct of his he has endeared himself to every good whig, and to all who has a true regard for the rights of mankind; and to add still more to his greatness and goodness, if I am rightly in∣formed, he tolerates the free exercise of the protestant religion throughout his dominion. Who can say but what God, in his providence, is about by this great revolution to pull down one of the ten horns which has long supported the beast?) But not to add here▪ pardon the digression, I now return; which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had commenced against Chrasroes king of Persia upon this induce∣ment that the king sought to ruin and extirpate these christians in his dominions that would not renounce the gospel.</P>
<P>Third. But when religion was once embraced in i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bodied
<PB N="33" REF="017905_0017_0FA37A55A4777AD0"/>
corporations, and established by law, and became a people's common interest and liberty, in a capacity to defend it with their lives and other liberties, and when it was propagated thro' the nations, then the Lord did call for other more active testi∣monies in the preservation and defence of it, of which we have many instances in histories. About the year 894 the Bohemian christians resisted Drahomica their Queen, who thought to have destroyed them, and to have re▪introduced paganism. About the year 1420 they maintained a long defensive war against the government, and the popes legates, under the management of their brave Captain Zizca, which was further prosecuted after him by the remaining Thaborites; and again in the year 1618, they maintained a defensive war against the emperor Ferdinand. Eleventh. Electing and erecting a new king in opposition to him Frederick Pal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tine of the Rhine in which cause many received a crown of martyrdom; and this was also espoused by king James the First of England, who aided his son in law against the emperor; but it is generally allowed not so effectually as he ought, and might have done, for indeed he was a poor weak Prince, and the father of tyrants.</P>
<P>Fourth. If we look into the history of the Walde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ses, alias, Walloons, these constant oppose<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> find ma∣ny instances of their resistance about the year <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>94. Very early, while Waldo, from whom they had their name, was alive, they began to defend themselves by arms, after the bloody edict of Al∣phonsus, king of Arragon; and in the year 1488, they resist by arms Albert de Capitanei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, sent by Pope Innocent VIII, in Pra∣gola and F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>niere, and throughout Pied Mont, wherefor the most part the offspring of the old Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>denses had their residence, where, very evidently, through many successions of ages, they shewed themselves to be the true successors of their worthy pro∣genitors, valliant for the truth; that is a most famous instance of their resistance in opposing vigorously the Lord of Trinity, in that same Pied Mont, at which time they so solemnly asl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed their ministers whether it was lawful or not to defend themselves against his violence, who did answer them in the affirmative, and accordingly they did it with wonderful success at that time, and many times afterwards; especially it is must remarkable how, in in the year 1655, a most vigorous d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ensive war was prosecuted against the duke of Savoy, by their captains Ginavel, Jahie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, &amp;c. which was espoused by many protestant princ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</P>
<P>Fifth. If we take a survey of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ories of the Albi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ses, we find many instances of their defensive resisting their oppressing
<PB N="34" REF="017905_0018_0FA37A5605367130"/>
superiors. About the year 1200 they defended themselves against the Popes legate, and his crossed soldiers, under the conduct first of the Earl of Beziers, and then of the Earl of Foise, and Earl of Remand, of Tholouse, and where helped by the English, who then possessed Guienne, bordering upon Thoulouse, which resistance continued many years.</P>
<P>Sixth. In Spain we find the people of Arragon contesting with Alph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsus III, and associating themselves together against him; and they tell Pedro III, their king, that if he would not govern by, and according to law, they would pursue him by arms, about the year 1283, as also other Spaniards who rose in arms several times against Pedro, the first king of Castile.</P>
<P>Seventh. It was this that brought the Cantons of Helvetia in∣to this state of freedom, wherein they have continued many years; for about the year 1260, they levied war against their op∣pressing nobles; and in the year 1308, they joined in covenant to defend themselves against the house of Austria; and in the year 1315▪ they renewed it at Brunna, in which, at length, the rest of the Cantons joined and formed themselves into a com∣mon wealth.</P>
<P>Eighth. If we take a view of the Germans, we will find, at the very commencement of the reformation, as soon as they got the name of protestants, they resisted the emperor Charles V▪ the Duke of Saxon, the Landgrave of Hesse, and the city of Maged∣burgh, with the advice of lawyers concluded, "that the laws of empire permitted resistance of the emperor, in some cases; that the times were then, so dangerous, that the very force of con∣science did leave them to arms and to make a league to defend themselves, though Caesar, or any in his name, should make war against them; for since he attempteth to root out religion, and sub∣vert our liberties, he giveth us cause enough to resist him with a good conscience." The matter standing as it doth, we may say they resist, as may be shewed, both by sacred and profane histo∣ries, and so on, the whole they undertook, and stated the wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon the account of religion and liberty.</P>
<P>Ninth. If we but cast an eye over the history of Holland, we will find how much they are indebted to this practice of defen∣sive arms, having thereby recovered both religion and liberty, and established themselves into a most flourishing state; we find even in the time of D. de Alvas's persecution, they began to defend Haerlem, and Valenciennes in Hainault, and went on till under the conduct of William of Nassau, Prince of Orange, they de∣clared the king of Spain to have fallen from the government of
<PB N="35" REF="017905_0018_0FA37A5605367130"/>
those countries, and so effectually shook off the yoke of ty∣ranny.</P>
<P>Tenth. If we turn to the French Hugonots, we will find many instances among them, and many brave heroes raised up to maintain the principles, and prosecute the practices thereof, of older and later date. The history of the civil wars of France is stored with their trophies, and the memories of Con∣de and Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igni will ever be fragrant. There were many in∣stances of resistance in those times, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Eleventh. The many practices of the Hungarians, resisting the encroachments of the house of Austria, prove the same; and when Matthias denied the free exercise of religion unto the protestants of Austria, they took up arms in their own de∣fence, and sent a protestation unto the states of Hungary, re∣quiring their assistance agreeable to their league.</P>
<P>Twelfth. The Polonians have oftentimes levied war against their kings, and we are furnished by Clark in his Martyrol▪ with a late instance of their resistance against the sovereign powers at L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a, in Poland, as late as the year 1655.</P>
<P>Thirteenth. The Deans and Swedes have not been slack on their parts, in taking course with their Christierns, kings of that name, whom they resisted and punished, and generally, wherever the reformation was received, we find this principle espoused, and the practice of it prosecuted; nay there hath been no nation in the world but it will be found they have ei∣ther resisted or killed tyrants.</P>
<P>Fourteenth. The most deserving and celebrated monarchs in the world, have espoused the quarrel of oppressed subjects not only such as Tamerlane, whose observable saying is noted when he advanced against Bajazet, I go, (says he) to chastise his tyranny, and to deliver the afflicted people; and Philip and Lewis of France, who assisted the barons of England, a∣gainst king John; and Charles the great, who upon this ground undertook a war against the Lombards, in Italy. But even Constantine the Great hath it recorded, to his great ho∣nour, that he employed his power and force against Licinius, upon no other motive but because he banished, tortured, and destroyed those christians in his dominions that would not re∣nounce their religion. And queen Elizabeth, of glorious me∣mory, is to be highly commended for assisting the Dutch to maintain their religion by force, when they could not enjoy it by favour. And king James First did give public aid to the protestants in Germany and Bohemia, against the emperor;
<PB N="36" REF="017905_0019_0FA37A56C31BC6C0"/>
against whom also Gustavas Adolphus marched, that he might deliver the oppressed cities from the bondage that Ferdinand had brought them into. Yea poor silly Charles First pretended, at least, to assist the protestants in France at Ree and Rachel, and though he himself was resisted by the parliaments of both kingdoms, yet he did declare in his acts of oblivion and paci∣fication, the Scots taking up arms against him, in defence of their religion and liberties, to be no treason or rebellion. See Apol. Relat. Sect. 11. page 149; and although the late ty∣rant Charles Second condemned all the r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sings of the people of Scotland for defence of religion and liberty, which his own tyranny forced them into; yet he justified the revolt of Hea∣then and Mahometan subjects, as in the instance of the young king of Bantam, when by reason of his tyranny his subjects revolting and resisting of him, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the said Charles Second, fur∣nished the revolters with ammunition. &amp;c. Indeed many in∣stances might be adduced which shews the righteousness of such residances, when the greatest of kings and queens have undertaken the patronising of them.</P>
<P>Third. From scripture proofs, the best of all proofs, I shall endeavour briefly to gather some of the many that might be pressed, which being put together to me, seem impregnable. I shall reduce them to these heads. First. I shall adduce some practices of the Lord's people, frequently reiterated, ne∣ver condemned, always approved, confirming this point. Second. Some severe reprehensions for their omission of this duty in the season thereof. Third. Some promises both of spiriting for the duty and of countenancing of it when under∣taken. Fourth. Some precepts commanding such a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chieve∣ments. Fifth. Some prayers, supplicating for them, all which, put together, I think will make a strong argument, for practi∣ces of this kind is common in scripture history.</P>
<P>First. I shall begin at the first war, which we find recorded in the world, wherein it seems the godly at first suffered some, but afterwards, by the virtue and val<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of their brethren, they were vindicated, and the victory recovered with great honour. Lot and his family, living in Sodom, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r taken prisoner by Chedarlaon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er and his confederates. Gen. x<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>v. 12. But Abra∣ham soon hearing of it armed his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, and pursued them hot f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t to Dan, and rescued him. Verse 14. 19. There∣by justifying that rebellion of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in by taking part and vindicating the rebels. Hence he that may rescue subjects from the arms of tyrants, by arms, may also rise with
<PB N="37" REF="017905_0019_0FA37A56C31BC6C0"/>
these subjects to oppose that violence; but here is a clear ex∣ample of that in Abraham, therefore, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Second. When the Lord's people were possessed of Canaan, and forgetting the Lord, did enter into affinity with these in∣terdicted nations, some of them were left to prove Israel, that the generations of the children of Israel might know to teach them war. Judges iii. 1 2. And when they did evil in the si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ht of the Lord, he sold them into the hand of Cushan-risha∣thaim king of Mesopotamia, whom they served and were sub∣ject to full eight years. Verse 8. But when they humbled themselves, and cried unto the Lord, their rebellion, in sha∣king off that yoke, was successful under the conduct of O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hniel. Verse 10. And after a relapse, unto the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke defection, they be∣came subject to Egl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, king of Moab, whom they served eigh∣teen years. Verse 14. But attempting the same remedy by arms, under the conduct of E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ud, they recovered their liberty; and after his death, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alling into that sin again, which procured the like misery, they became subject to Ja<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in king of Canaan, who twenty years mightily oppressed them. Judg. iv. 1, 3. But by the Lord's commandment, under the conduct of Deborah and Barak, they rebelled and prevailed. Whence I infer, if the Lord's people, serving a haughty tyrant, may shake off the yoke of their subjection, then it is duty to defend themselves, and re∣sist them, for there is no other way of shaking it off; but these examples prove the former, therefore, &amp;c. Obj. if any should reply, and cavil, and declare these were not their own kings, to whom they owed allegiance, but only invading conquerors, whom they might resist, I answer, First, Yet they were the sove∣reign powers, for the time being, and therefore if the doctrines and principles of both antient and modern to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies be true and good, they ought, upon no pretence whatsoever, to be resisted (O! poor slaves, that believes such doctrines!) and perhaps by compact, they were not their kings, yet by conquest they were, as much as that would make them, and by their own consent, when they paid them kings due, (viz) tribute. Second, No more are they our kings who attempts to destroy charters▪ overturn religion, liberty, and law, as the king of Britain and his venal parliament lately did. Witness the Boston charter, &amp;c. I say to such we owe no allegiance, no more than Israel of old did to those ty∣rants, for tyranny is the same in all ages. Third, I retort that old colewort, twice boiled, who should be judge whether they were their own lawful kings or not, for they acted as kings, and thought themselves their absolute Lords, and gave themselves
<PB N="38" REF="017905_0020_0FA37A5783D1E7C0"/>
out to be such; and yet we find an approved rebellion against them. Mr. Gee, in his magistrates original, Chap 8. Sect. 4. Page 268, improves these instances to the same purpose, and adds. "Neither as far as my observation goes, can any imme∣diate or extraordinary command of word, for what they so did, be pretended to or pleaded from the text, for many of them, or for any, save Barak or Gideon."</P>
<P>Third. Yet Gideon's example, though he had an extraordinary call, cannot be pretended as unimo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able on the matter, for that was ordinary, though the call and manner was extraordinary; he, with the aid of a few m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, did break the yoke of subjection to Midian. Judg. vi. 7. And having called his brethren out of all Mount Ephraim, into a conjunction with him, in the pursuit of his victory, when he demanded supply of the princes of Succoth, and of the men of Penuel, and they denied it, he served them as enemies. Whence I conclude, if a small party may, with God's approbation, deliver themselves and the whole of their commu∣nity from the bondage of their oppressing masters, whom they had served several years, and may punish their kings that do not turn out to their assistance, and encourage them in that at∣tempt, then must it be duty to defend themselves against their op∣pressors, that rule over them, and all ought to concur in it, or else there would not be justice in punishing them that were de∣fective in this work; but we see the former by this example, therefore, &amp;c. Obj. If it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e said that Gideon, and the rest of the extraordinary raised judges, were magistrates, therefore they might defend and deliver their country, which a private people, that are only subjects▪ may not do. I answer, First▪ They were subject to those tyrants that oppressed them, who were then the sovereign powers of that time; and yet they shook of that yoke be defensive arms. Second▪ They were not then magistrates when they first appeared for their countries defence, and deliverance; neither in that did they act as such, but only as Captains of re∣bels in the esteem of them that had power over them. Just so has our modern oppressors and to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies looked upon all our generals and officers in this grand struggle for American liberty. It is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Gideon was no ruler, until that authority was conferred <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him after the deliverance. See Judg. viii. 22, &amp;c. Yet he did all this before.</P>
<P>Fourth. When his bastard Ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>melech usurped the govern∣ment, and was made king by the men of Shechem, at length, God sending an evil spirit between him and his complices, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him up, not only was he resisted by the treacherous She∣chemites,

which was their brand and bane, in the righteous judg∣ment of God, for their aiding at first in killing his brethren. Judg. ix. 23, 24. &amp;c. But also he was opposed by others of the men of Israel, as at Thebez, where he was slain by a woman. Verse <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0, at the end. Whence, if an usurping tyrant acknow∣leged as king by the generality, may be disowned by the godly, and threatened with God's vengeance to consume both him and his complices, that comply with him; and if he may be opposed and resisted, not only by those that set him up, but also by others that were in subjection to him, and at length be killed by them, without resentment of the rest of the nation, then most it cer∣tainly be duty for a people who had no hand is the setting up such a tyrant to defend themselves against his force; but th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> former is true by this example, therefore, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Fifth. When Israel of old, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell under the tyranny of a Ammon, oppressing them eighteen years, they did, by resisting these su∣preme powers, shake off their yoke, under the conduct of J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ph∣thah; and being challenged sharply by the men of Ephraim, who, it seems, claimed the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ero<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ative of making war, and there∣fore came to revenge and reduce J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>phthah and his company to or∣der, just like tories, who are very tenacious of this plea of the Eph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mites, that at least, without the nobles of the kingdom, no war is to be made; yet we find Jephthah did not much regard it, but stoutly defended himself, and slew of them 42 000 m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, by their Shibboleth. Judg. xii. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> people then, when questioned for defending themselves by them that claim a superiority over them, and should deliver them, may defend themselve both without them, and against them, then I say, it is a people's duty and privilege; but the former is true by this example, there∣fore, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Sixth. They were then made subject to the Philistines forty years, whom the men of Judah acknowledged for their rulers, yet Samson, that rough handed saint, never ceased from pelting them upon all occasions; and when challenged for it by the men of Judah saying knowe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t thou not that the Philistines are ru∣lers over us, what is that thou hast done? Samson objects no∣thing against their b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g rulers, but notwithstanding prosecutes his purpose of vindicating himself in defence of his country. As they did unto me says he, so have I done unto them. Judg. xv. 11. Hence, if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ints may avenge themselves upon them whom the country ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s rulers, and when enab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed by God, may do to them as they did to them, then must it be a duty for them to defend themselves against them; but the antecedent is true by this example, therefore, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="017905_0021_0FA37A5843D78928"/>
Seventh. When Saul, in the pursuit of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, had charged the people with a foolish oath not to eat any food until the evening, Jonathan his own son ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed but a little honey, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he must die! which Saul confirmed with another peremptory oath, God do so to him, and more also, if he should not die. Whereupon the people, as resolute on the other hand to save him, resisted the rage of Saul, and swore as peremptorily that not one hair of his head should fall to the ground; so the people rescued Jonathan that he died not. 1 Sam. xiv. 44, 45. Hence if people may covenant, by oath, to resist the commands and rescue a man from a tyrant's cruelty, then it is duty to defend themselves against him. The Antecedent is true here.</P>
<P>Eighth. Afterwards, when the manner of the king, presaged by Samuel, was verified in Saul's degeneration, into many abu∣ses of government, this privilege of resistance was not wholly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>cipated, but maintained by David▪ defensive appearance; with his little army, he took Goliah's swo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, not for ornament o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> only to fright Saul, but to defend himself with it, and was Captain first to 400 men. 1 Sam xxi. 2. Had a mind to keep ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Keilah against him with 600 men. 1 Sam. xxiii. 13. And afterwards a great host came to him to Z<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g▪ while he kept himself close because of Saul, the son of K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh. 1 Chron. xii. 1. Throughout wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> they left Saul, and came and helped David against him. This is proved at large by Lex Rex, Quest. 22, page 340.</P>
<P>Ninth. The city Abel, whether Sheba the traitor had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led, did well to resist <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the king's general coming to destroy a whole city for one traitor's sake, and not offering pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce to it ac∣cording to law. Deut. xx. 10. And defended themselves by gates and wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls, notwithstanding he had a commission from the king, 2 Sam. xx. And after the capitulating, they are never challenged for rebellion.</P>
<P>Tenth. The ten tribes revolted from the house of David, when Rehoboam claimed an absolute power and would not ac∣quiesce to the people's just conditions. 1 King's xii. 2 Chron. x. Hence If it be lawful for a part of the people to sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke off the king, refuse subjection to him, and set up a new one, when he but resolves to play the tyrant, then it must be duty to resist his violence when he is tyrannizing; but the antecedent i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> clear by this example, and is fully vindicated by J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. Pop Ch 3. p. 52.</P>
<P>Eleventh. The example of E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isha the prophet is considerable▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> King's vi. 32. E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him, and the king seat a man before him, but ere the messenger
<PB N="41" REF="017905_0021_0FA37A5843D78928"/>
came to him, he said to the elders see how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head. Look when the messenger cometh, shut the door; is not the sound of his masters feet be∣hind him. Here was violent resistance resolved both against the man and his master, though the king of the land for the time; and this calling him the son of a murderer, and resisting of him is no more extraordinary, though it was an extraordinary man's act, than it is sot a plaintiff to libel a true crime against a wicked person, and for an oppressed man to close the door upon a mur∣derer. Lex Rex, Quest 32 p. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>6. Hence I argue, if a king of his messenger coming to use unjust violence, against an inno∣cent subject, be no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to be regarded than a murderer's emissa∣ry, but may be resisted by that innocent subject, then must a community of such innocent subjects defend themselves against a tyrant, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his bloody emissaries, coming against them on such a wicked errand. The Antecedent is here clear, which to all intents and purposes, justifies the justness of the American de∣fence, as Gage, George's tool and bloody emissary, was sent for the express purpose, to murder the Bostonians, if they should not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ely surrender up all their rights and privileges without re∣sistance.</P>
<P>Twelfth. The city Libna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> revolted from under Jehoram's tyranny. 2 Chron. xxi. 10. P. Martyr on the place saith, they revolted because he endeavoured to compel them to idolatry. Hence if it be lawful for a part of the people to revolt from a ty∣rant, then it is duty to defend themselves against his force. The former is true therefore, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Thirteenth When Athaliah usurped the monachy. Jehoiada the priest strengthened himself and made a covenant with the Captains, &amp;c to put her down and set up Joash. 2 King<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> xi. 2. Chron. xxiii. and when she came and cried out treason! treason! they regarded it no, but commanded to kill her and all that help her. Whence I argue, if those that are not kings, may lawfully kill an usurpress, and all that help her, then may a people resist them. But J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hoi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>da, though no magistrate, did it; therefore, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Fourteenth. The repressing and punishing Amaziah, the son of Joash, is an undeniable instance, vindicated by the great and l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arned Mr. Knox. After the time that he turned away from following the Lord, the people made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish; but they sent and slew him there. 2 Kings xiv 19. 2 Chron xxv. 27. Hence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fortiori if people may conspire and concur in executing judgment upon their
<PB N="42" REF="017905_0022_0FA37A59023045B0"/>
king, turning tyrant, then much more must they defend them∣selves against his violence.</P>
<P>Fifteenth. The same power of people's resisting kings was exemplified in Uzzah, or Azariah, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e would needs be su∣preme in things sacred as well as civil. 2 Kings xv. 2 Chron. xxvi. Fourscore priests that were valliant men withstood him, and thurst him out of the temple; they troubled him, faith Na∣tables; they expelled him faith Armon. Vid. Pool Synopsis, &amp;c. See this vindicated by Mr. Knox, page 48 49. Hence if pri∣vate subjects may by force resist and hinder the king from trans∣gressing the law, then must they resist him when forcing them to transgress the law.</P>
<P>Sixteenth. After the return from the Babylonish captivity, when the Jews set about building the Temple, which they chose to do themselves, and not admit of any association with enemies; upon their misinformation and false accusation, that they were building the rebellious and bad city, and would refuse to pay the king his custom, they were straightly discharged by A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>axe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, to proceed in their work, and the inhibition was executed by force and power. Ez<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>v. But by the encouragement of the pro∣phet. Haggai and Zechariah, countermanding the king's decree, they would not be hin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red, the eye of their God being upon them, though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the governor of those parts Shetharbonnai and their companions would have boasted them from it, with the usual arguments of tories. Who hath commanded you to do so and so? Ezra v. 3, 5. And yet all this was before the decree of Darius was obtained in their savour. Ezra vi. Hence I argue, if a people may prosecute without and against a king's command, and before all allowance by law can be obtained, then may a people resist these commands and force used to execute them.</P>
<P>Seventeenth. When Nehemiah came to Jerusalem, and invited the Jews to build up the walls of the city, they strengthened their hands for that very good work against great opposition; and when challenged by S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at the Horonite, Tob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ah the ser∣vant the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, great king's men, all of them, who despised and boasted them, what is this that ye do? Will ye rebel against the king? Say they he would not plead authority, though in the general he had the king's autho∣rity for it; yet he would not give them any other satisfaction than to intimate whether they had that or not, having the call of God to the work, they would go on in their duty, and God would prosper them against their opposition. Nehemiah ii 19. 20. And they went on, and were directed to remember the Lord
<PB N="43" REF="017905_0022_0FA37A59023045B0"/>
and fight for their brethren, &amp;c. and to build, with weapons in their hands. Neh. iv. And brought it to an end, notwithstand∣ing of all their practices to fright them from it. Chap. vi. Hence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, if neither challenges of rebellion, nor practices of ene∣mies, who pretend authority, nor any discouragements whatso∣ever, should deter people from a duty which they have a call and capacity from God to prosecute, and if they may remove it against all opposition, by defensive arms, then when a people are oppressed and treated as rebels for a necessary duty, they may and must defend▪ themselves and maintain their duty, not∣withstanding of all pretentions of authority against them.</P>
<P>Eighteenth. I shall now conclude with one instance more, which is vindicated by Jus. Populi, from the history of Esther, be∣cause Mordecai refused to do homage to a hangman, Haman I should say, at that day, now a proud North, a cruel edict was procured from Ahasuerus to destroy all the Jews at that time; now from George III. to destroy all the Bostonians by starving them &amp;c. which was written and sealed with the king's ring, according to the laws of the Medes and Persians, becoming a law irrevocable and irreversable. Esther iii. 12, 13. Yet the Lord's providence, always propitious to his people, brought it about so that Haman being hanged, and Mordecai advanced, the Jews were called and capacitated as well as necessitated to re∣sist that armed authority that decreed to massacre them, and that by the king's own allowance. Esther ix. When his former decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, it was turned to he contrary, that no man could withstand them. Here they had the allowance of authority to resist authority, and this was not a gift of a new right by that grant, which they had not before, only it was corroborative of the irradical right to defend them∣selves; which is not the donative of kings, and which they had power to exercise and use without this, though may be not the same capacity, for the king's warrant could not make it lawful in point of conscience, if it had not been so before. Hence I argue, if people may have the allowance of well advised-authori∣ty to resist the decree and force of unlawful authority, then may people maintain right authority in defending themselves against the injuries of pretended authority; but by this very instance we plainly see, that the Jews had Ahasuerus's allowance to resist the decree and force of his own ill-advised authority, though irreversable, and hence we learn, that distinction in this point is not groundless between resisting the authority of su∣preme power and the abuses of the same.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="017905_0023_0FA37A59C3576C48"/>
Secondly. We have in scripture both tacit and express re∣proofs for neglecting this duty in the right season thereof.</P>
<P>First. In Jacob's swan song, or prophetical testament, where∣in he foretels what should be the fate and future condition of each of the tribes, and what should be remarked in their carriage, influencing their after lot in their generations, for which they should be commended or discommended approved or reproved▪ coming to Issachar he prophetically exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>obates his future ass-like stupidity, and that indulging himself in his lazy ease and lukewarm security, he should emancipate himself and his inter∣ests into a servile subjection unto his oppressors impositions; e∣ven when he should be in a capacity to shake them off, and free himself by resistance. Gen x<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ix 14, 15. Issachar is a strong ass, couching down between two burthens. A true picture this of toryism. This is set down by the Holy Ghost as the brand and bane, not of the pers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of Issachar, Jacob's son, but of the tribe to be i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nured upon them, when they should be in such a condition, by their own silliness. Hence I argue, if the Holy Ghost <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>obate a people for their stupid subjection to prevailing tyranny, when they do not approve their ability, capacity, and right to maintain and defend their liberties and privileges, then this implies a commanded duty to defend them according to their capacity from all unjust invasion. But the former is true here also the latter.</P>
<P>Second. In Debo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ah's song, after their victorious resistance, the people are severely upbraided for not assisting in that expe∣dition. Judges v. 16, 17, 23. And Meroz is particularly cursed for not coming to the help of the Lord, against the mighty. This is recorded as a resting reproof against all that will withdraw their helping hand from the Lord's people, when necessitated to appear in defensive arms for the preservation of their lives and liberties. On the other hand, Zebulon and Naph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ali are commended for jeoparding their lives in the high places of the fields, and are ap∣proved for that practice of fighting against the king of Canaan, that then ruled over them. Verse 18, 19. Hence I argue, if people be reproved and cursed for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aying at home to lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k to their own interests, when others jeopard their lives for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir coun∣try's defence and freedom, then this implies it is duty to conc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in so venturing. But here Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, Dan, Aster, and Meroz <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> reproved and cursed for staying at home, when Zebulon and N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ali jeoparded their lives. Ergo.</P>
<P>Third. We have in scripture many promises of the Lord's approving and countenancing the duty of defensive arms, even against their oppressing rulers.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="017905_0023_0FA37A59C3576C48"/>
First. In that foresighted testament of the patriarch Jacob, in that part of it which concerns God, he prophecies that tribe shall have a lot in the world, answering his name, and be engaged in many conflicts with oppressing dominators, who at first should p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vail over him, but at length God should so bless his endea∣vours to free himself from their oppressions, that he should over∣come. There is an excellent elegancy in the original, answer∣ing to the etymology of the name of Gad, which signifies a troop, reading thus in the Hebrew: Gad a troop, shall over-troop him, but he shall over-troop them at the last. Gen. x<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ix. 19. And Moses, homologating the same tistimony in his bles∣sing the tribes before his death, shews that be should make a ve∣ry forcible and successful resistance, and should execute the ju∣stice of the Lord over his oppressors. Deut. xxxiii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0, 21. Wherein is implied a promise of resistance to be made against op∣pressing tyrants, who should acquire the supreme rule over them for a time, and the success of that resistance for overcoming ne∣cessarily supposes resistance to be made against oppressing con∣querors and tyrants. Hence I argue, where there is a promise of success at last, to a people's conflicts against tyranny, there is implied an approbation of the duty, and, also a promise of its performance wrapped up in that promise. But here is a pro∣mise, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Second. In that threatening against tyrants▪ shewing how they shall be th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st away and burnt up with fire▪ there is couched a promise, and also an implied precept of resisting them. 2. Sam. xxi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i. 6. The sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st away with hands fenced with iron, &amp;c. Which clearly implies resistance, and even more than that, rejection and repression. Hence I farther argue, if it be threatened as a curse against rulers of Belial, and promised as a blessing that they shall be so roughly handled, then this implies a duty to resist them, who cannot be otherwise taken; but here this is threatened, therefore, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Third. When the Lord shall have mercy an Jacob and chuse Israel, it is promised. Isaiah xiv. 2, 3. That they shall take them captives whose captives they were, and they shall rule over their oppressors. This necessarily implies and in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> promise of re∣sistance against these oppressing rulers, in the time of their dom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣neering, as well as revenge, after their yoke should be broken, and some<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ng of men's actions, as well as God's judgment, in breaking that yoke for they could not take them cap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> rule over them, except first they had resisted them whose cap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ey were. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> power, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="46" REF="017905_0024_0FA37A5AEA1D76B0"/>
where unto was the bondage wherein they were made to serve. Hence I argue, that if it be promised that a captivated, subjugated peo∣ple, shall break the yoke, and free themselves of the bondage of them that had them in subjection, then it is promised, in that case, they must resist the supreme powers for such were they whose captives they were. The a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ecedent is here express.</P>
<P>Fourth. There are promises that the Lord's people, when those that rule over them are incensed against them on account of their holy lives, and when many shall be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ighted from their duty by fear, or corrupted with flattery, shall be made strong to exploits, though in such enterprizes they may want success for some time, and fall by the sword and flame and by captivity and spoil many days. Dan. xi. 30, 34 This was very emi∣nently fulfilled in the history of the Maccabees before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>arsed. Hence I argue, if it be promised that a people shall be strong to do exploits in resisting the arms of their rulers opposing their re∣ligion and liberties, then it is clear such resistance is lawful even though it should fail of succes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for a time. But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his is here pro∣mised to the same purpose. It is promised that after the Lord's people have been long kept as prisoners under the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of tyrants they shall, by a vigorous resistance, be saved from their tyranny. Zech. ix. 13, 17 When the Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> for him, and raise up Zion's sons against the son of Greece.</P>
<P>So it was in their resistances and victories against the success∣ors of Alexander, who had the rule over them for a time. And so it may be again▪ when the Lord shall so b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd his people <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him. Hence I argue, that if the Lord promises to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> his people for action, against their oppressing rulers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> their attempts when so fitted and spirited, with glorious success, then it is their duty, and also their honour, to resist them; but here that is plainly promised, therefore, &amp;</P>
<P>Fifth. There are promises of the Lord's making use of his people, and strengthening them to break in pieces the power of his and their enemies, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them against all their power and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> over them, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is promise<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the threatened <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the Babylonian usurpation Jer. ii. 20, 25. Thou art, says he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> (of whom he speaks) as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od of his inheritance. In the preceding verse. My battle-ax<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and weapons of war, and with thee will I break in pieces powers that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> supreme over them. Hence I argue, that if the Lord will make use of his peo∣ple's vindictive arms against Babylon, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> over <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, then he will justify their defensive arms against Babylon oppressing them.
<PB N="47" REF="017905_0024_0FA37A5AEA1D76B0"/>
Here it is promised therefore, &amp;c. So Micah, iv, 11. To the end many nations shall be gathered to defile and look upon Zi∣on, and then the Lord shall give allowance and commission to his people to arise and thr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h, &amp;c. What time the full accom∣plishment is refered to is not my concern at present to enquire into. It seems to look towards the New Testament times, wherein the Lord's people shall be first in greatest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and then enlarged. But to restrict it to the spiritual conquest over the nations, by the ministry of the wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d though I will not deny but that may be included▪ seems too great a straitning of the scope, and not so opposite to the expressions, which certainly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to import some forcible action of men, and more than the peaceable propogation of the gospel. It is usually referred to the latter days of that dispensation, when both the Jewish and Ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>til<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Zion shall be totally and finally delivered from Babylo∣nian or anti-christian tyranny, before or about which period the enemies of Christ and of his people shall attempt their utmost power to destroy the church, groaning under their bondage. But when they are all well mattered in a general rendezvous, the Lord's people shall have a gallant game at the chase. But when∣soever the time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of fulfilling the promise it ensures to the peo∣ple of God, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> success of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> arms against them that pretended a domination over them. And it looks to a time when they should have no rulers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f their own, but them under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> they had been long groaning, and now brought to a very low pass; yet here they should not only resist but thresh <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Hence I argue that if in the latter days the people of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> honoured and acted so th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with such a spirit and capacity to thre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> down these powers under which they have been long groaning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, when the Lord puts them in such capacity to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> it▪ they should be ambitious of such an ho∣nour. But here <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> promised▪ therefore, &amp;c.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> from the prophets vision. Zach. i. 19, 20 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> resisting the four horns; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Judah, so that no man did lift up his head: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> them to cast out the horns of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> their horn over the land of Ju∣dah. These horns had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> power over Judah for a time, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e they were in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> capacity to resist them; but as soon as the Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> capacity and instruments, im∣powered to resist them, they do it effectually. The carpenters are certainly the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> people themselves, for here they are opposite to the Gentiles, which all were except the Lord's peo∣ple.
<PB N="48" REF="017905_0025_0FA37A5B42EADB50"/>
Hence I argue, that if the Lord promises, when re∣conciled to his people, to furnish them with instruments to fray and scatter the power of tyrants, who have long bore down their head, then, when they are so furnished, they may resist them; but the Lord here promises that; therefore, &amp;c. This is more plainly promised <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> 5. &amp;c. Then they shall be as mighty men, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> their enemies, and the pride of Assyria shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Hence I further argue, that if the Lord shall have mercy on his people, will bless their resistance against their enemies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> arms is lawful and duty to use, when the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</P>
<P>Fourth. We have also precepts from whence we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> conse∣quently conclude the approven duty of defensive arms against oppressing rulers.</P>
<P>First. The children of Israel are commanded to vex the Mi∣dianites and smite them, for, saith the Lord, they vex you with their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iles. Numb. xxv. 17, 18. And to avenge them∣selves. Numb. xxx. 2. Which did not only oblige the people when they had M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ses for their magistrate to lead them forth, but, in the days of Gideon, when they were under their rule, whom they were to avenge themselves upon. Hence I argue, if people must vex their enemies, and avenge themselves of them by a war offensive, much more may they resist them by a war defensive, when invaded by their cruelty.</P>
<P>Second. There is a command to punish every city or party, making apostacy unto idolatry. Deut. xiii. 12, 15. upon this moral ground was Israel's war against Benjamin. Judges xx. and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir bringing Amaziah unto cordign punishment, which is vindicated by Mr. Knox. Hence I argue, if people are to bring to condign punishment idolatrous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> much more ought they to resist all tyrants, seeking to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and liberty, for they are twins Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. As I said before, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the other cannot live.</P>
<P>Third. There is a precept not only to defend, but also, to rescue and deliver our brethren when in Hazard. Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>v. xx<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>v. 11, 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ we must not forbear to deliver them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> drawn to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; which will at least infer the duty of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> themselves; for if it be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> from any, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> power that would take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> much more is it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, and ourselves both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> violence, but it is duty to rescue them, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="017905_0025_0FA37A5B42EADB50"/>
Fourth. All those that would learn to do well are command∣ed, Isa. i. 17. to relieve the oppressed; which is not spoken to kings only, many of whom were the oppressors. The Prin∣ces were rebellious and companions of thieves, Verse 23. So also, Isa. lviii. 6. It is required of a people that would be ac∣cepted of God in their humiliations, to let the oppressed go free, and to break every yoke. Hence I argue, if it be duty to re∣lieve the oppressed, by breaking the yoke of them that oppress them, then it is duty to defend them and ourselves, both against them that would oppress us more. But the former is here commanded, therefore, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Fifth. There is a command for a spoiled oppressed people, when the Lord is reconciled to them, and sympathizes with them, to deliver themselves from their rulers servitude. Zech. ii. 7. Deliver thy self O Zion, which dwelleth with the daugh∣ter of Babylon. Which comprehends all the ordinary active means of people's delivering themselves from oppressing powers that rule over them; and consequently defensive resistance, for it cannot only be restricted to flight, included verse 6. the promise annexed verse 9 imports more, when they that spoiled them, shall be a spoil to their servants. Whereby it is infinuated they were so to deliver themselves as not only to free themselves from their servitude, but to bring their masters under subjection. Hence I argue, if the Lord's people being subject to tyrants ruling over them for the time, may deliver themselves from their oppressing masters, then may they resist them, and defend themselves, therefore, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Sixth. There is a command given by the blessed Jesus to his disciples, to provide themselves with weapons for their defence against them that should attempt their lives, as well as with other things necessary for their sustenance. Luke xxii. 36. Now he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip; and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment and buy one. Before, when he had sent them out upon an extra∣ordinary commission, as it were to serve their apprenticeship in the work of the gospel, he did not allow them such solicitous care to provide themselves, because he would give them a proof of his sufficiency to sustain and protect them without the ordinary means of their own diligence; but now, when he was about to withdraw his bodily presence from them, and would warn them of the many discouragements they were to look for in the prosecution of their more continued work, which they had a commission for, not to be retracted, he would not
<PB N="50" REF="017905_0026_0FA37A5C0307C990"/>
have them expect provision and protection by a course of mira∣cles, but to provide themselves with means for their sustenance, and also for their defence against the violence of men, which chiefly was to be expected from their rulers, who would perse∣cute them under the notion of transgressors of the laws of the kingdoms and countries. He was not, indeed, to make much use of them at that time for himself, who was then to finish the work of redemption by suffering, only that what was written might be accomplished in him, he would make so much use of them as voluntarily to be involved under the censure and re∣proach of rebellion, being taken among men in arms, that he might be reckoned among transgressors. Verse 37. Therefore when they told him they had two swords, he said it is enough. Verse 38. I think I need not stand long here to confute that im∣pertinency of a conceit that these were spiritual swords, which indeed deserves no confutation, being fitter to be put among the many delicious destractions, and other errors of Quakers, than to be numbered among the notions of men of common understand∣ing. Indeed I could hardly be brought to believe they did hold such an error, if I had not been informed by a person of credit, who assured me he had it from the mouth of one of their speak∣ers or teachers. O horrid blasphemy! Purchase the spirit of God, or the sword of the spirit, or a spiritual sword, with the price of an old garment. Surely if this was true, then the purse and scrip must be spiritual too, and these bought by selling of old garments; and yet they would be such spiritual swords as would cut off carnal ears, and such as would be both visible and sensible, and two of them would be enough. But it does not ad∣mit of a doubt, but what they were ordinary and material swords, which the Lord did command his followers to provide themselves with for their defence as men, in cases of necessity, and when they should be in a capacity to improve them against their mur∣dering persecutors, against whom he gives his royal grant of re∣sistance, that the world may know his subjects, though they have more privileges spiritual, yet they have no less human privileges than other men, although at that period of his determined suffer∣ing, he would not allow the present use of them. From hence I argue, that if the Lord's people should provide themselves with arms of defence, though they should, by a wicked world, be re∣puted sinners and the greatest of transgressors for so doing, then surely they may use these arms of defence against them that per∣secute them; therefore &amp;c.</P>
<P>Fifth. We may infer the same truth from some of the pray∣ers
<PB N="51" REF="017905_0026_0FA37A5C0307C990"/>
of the saints, wherein they glory in the constant expectation of the Lord's strengthening them, and favouring and approving their helpers, and in the experience of the Lord's assisting them, while in the mean time constitute in a formed appearance of re∣sistance. I shall only hint these.</P>
<P>First. In that prayer, Psal. xliv. 5. They glory in hope, that through the Lord they will push down their enemies, &amp;c. Yet then at that time they were under the power of tyrants, which they were resisting, for Verse 9. They complain they were put to shame, because the Lord went not forth with their armies, and they which hated them spoiled them; and for his sake were killed all day long. Hence they plead, that the Lord would a∣wake and not forget their affliction and oppression; whereby it is evident, they were under the yoke of tyrants, and resisting ac∣cording to their might; which, by whomsoever or upon what occasion soever, the psalm was compiled, shews that no want of success in resisting tyrants can mar the saints faith in pleading for the Lord's assistance and approbation of the duty. Hence I argue, that if they that in faith may pray for and boast of their treading down their enemies, that rise like tyrants up against them, they may also in faith attempt the resisting them in their own defence. But here the Lord's people did the former; there∣fore, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Second. We find David, under Saul's persecution, while h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had a party of 600 men to defend himself against his rage, in the psalms which he composed upon that occasion, not only com∣plaining of oppressors, but encouraging himself in the faith that God would be with them that assisted him in his attempt to de∣fend himself, and imprecating destruction to Saul and his com∣plices. That the Lord would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut them off in his truth and let him see his desire upon them. Psal. liv. 4, 5. last verse, and Psal. lvii, 4. and Psal▪ lvii throughout, and Psal. cxl. 7, 9. He imprecates against the head of them that compassed him about, and of course against Saul. Whence I argue, First. If the Lord's people, conflicting with and encompassed with oppressing rulers, as so many lions and dogs, may pray and praise for the help of those that assist them in their endeavours of self-preservation from them, then may they make use of their help for their de∣fence for which they pray and praise. But here we see the Lord's people did the former; therefore they may and ought to do the latter.</P>
<P>Second. If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> may pray against kings, and for preservation from them, then may we defend ourselves against them, and en∣deavour
<PB N="52" REF="017905_0027_0FA37A5CC3C25B48"/>
the means of that preservation for which we pray? The connection is before cleared, yet here I add, that which will give a dispensation from our duty of praying for them, will also dis∣pense from the duty of being passively subject to their will, and consequently will allow the defending ourselves from their vio∣lence. And here we see tyranny and treachery, and designed mischief, will give a dispensation from our duty of p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aying for them, altho' that be duty as indispensible a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> subjection. Again if any thing deter us from resisting of kings, it must be respect to their majesty and the character of the Lord's anointing upon them. But we see no respect to that will deter a believer from praying in faith against them, therefore no such respect will hin∣der, but that he may defend himself against his violence; and indeed, if we do but consider it right, if the impression of any majesty God hath put upon kings, should tie up our hands from any resistance, it will also restrain from prayer resistance; for if that impression have any force at any time, it must be when a man is most solemnly stated before God, and speaking to God as a christian, rather than when he is acting as a man with a man like himself; and as prayer resistance is the most formidable and forceable resistance of any in the world▪ as this Saul, and our la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e George, and many other tyrants have found, by their wo∣ful experience, so it is more restricted than other resistance, for we may defend ourselves against many whom we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not pray against, to wit, our private <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, for whom we are command∣ed to pray; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no body will deny but we may resist their vio∣lence; and likewise, we are commanded to pray for kings, when invested with God's authority; but when, by their degeneration, we are loosed from that obligation to pray for them, and allows us to pray against them, when they turn enemies to God, and oppressors of his people, as we see in the prayer of the Psalmist, then may we most warrantably resist them by defensive arms.</P>
<P>Third and lastly. Among the hallelujahs in the end of Psalms, there is one calculated for the prevailing time of the church, when the Lord shall take pleasure in his people. In that time of the saints being joyful in glory, when they may glo∣ry in the rest and security the Lord will vouchsafe upon them, they are prophetically, and very pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hetically, excited to praise prayer wise. Psal. cxlix. 6. To the end let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two edged sword in their hand to bind their kings with chains, to execute upon them the judg∣ment written. This honour have all the saints, hallelujah. This was their praise and honour when they were brought on to execute vengeance on their kings and nobles of Canaan; this
<PB N="53" REF="017905_0027_0FA37A5CC3C25B48"/>
also in David's time was the ambition and also the attainment of the saints in their triumphant victories over many of their op∣pressors round about them. But it looks to a further and more fa∣mous executio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of vengeance upon the tyrants of the world, when they have long kept under the church of God, and at length, the Lord shall give his people a capacity to break their yoke, which, whenever it shall be, shall be then great honour. Hence I argue lastly, if it will be the honour of the saints, when the Lord puts them in capacity to execute vengeance upon their ene∣mies, though they be kings, nobles▪ &amp;c. that oppress them, then it may be their ambition to seek it; at least they may resist them. Thus I think I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shewn from the law of God, the law of nature, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of nations the lawfulness of the use of de∣fensive arms, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> defend our rights, liberties civil and re∣ligious, when attacked by tyrants; at least I think it will con∣vince all but such as are determined not to be convinced. Espe∣cially, I think it appears clear from scripture practices, reproofs, promises, precepts, and prayers, this truth has been proven; al∣though I allow that other precious truths are more natively de∣du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d, yet this great truth by unstrained and unconstrained con∣sequence, may, and is also, clearly inferred.</P>

<HEAD>A short Receipt for a Continental Disease, The name whereof is the love of Money.</HEAD>
<P>THE holy scriptures informs us, that the love of money▪ is the root of all evil. And this our daily experience doth also make manifest. It drives people into the commission of all evil, to the ruin of themselves and others. How are people dai∣ly distressing each other in sueing and tearing each other limb from limb, in order to handle a little of this trash, a world of which will not purchase a spark of grace, nor one inch of time, when on a death bed. Paying no regard to the distress of the times, nor to the cries of the poor, the needy, widow, and fa∣therless children. Perhaps such whose fathers have fought, bled, and died by our sides, nobly fighting in our glorious cause. How doleful the thought, that we who have so nobly joined hand in hand to defeat British cruelty and oppression, should now devour one another? Which is daily practicing. I shall now give a word of advice to creditors and debtors, which I shall divide into two classes. First publick creditors and debtors. Secondly private ditto. Publick creditors is our rulers and governors, who have a right, for our good and safety, to demand taxes from us. Gen∣tlemen, let me beg of you to be as sparing in your demands as possible. You are not unsensible that the times are hard, and cash scarce. Endeavour to give satisfaction to the commonalty, that what they pay in taxes is faithfully applied to the uses it were paid for. The money is the people's to pay and yours to apply, which ought to be done with the greatest oeconomy. Let no one get rich that handles publick money. I think I have once read of a great general that had served his country long and faithfully, when he car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to die all he could call his own was his dish and spoon, and was buried by charity. A rare instance indeed, but a noble one. He prefered the publick's interest to his own.</P>
<P>You, my countrymen, publick debtors. Gentlemen, please to consider that no war can be carried on, no government kept up, without taxes, and hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> ones too; and consider what a situa∣tion you would soon be in, if there was no government. Could you sleep one night in peace? Could yo call any thing your own one day▪ Therefore if you are wise you will most chear∣fully part with some of your wealth to secure the rest; for I am confident he is an enemy to himself and country too, that is back∣ward
<PB N="55" REF="017905_0028_0FA37A5D83B70CC0"/>
in paying his taxes. Consider that it is not for us common people to be led into all the secrets of government. Surely we must believe that those which we have trusted at the helm of af∣fairs does know best what sums is necessary to be raised from us for our good and protection; and I think we may rest assured that our legislature will not lay any needless bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thens upon us; for my own part, I have that confidence in them that I am de∣termined to pay my taxes as long as I have a copper left, or can raise it; for I am sure if the enemy should overcome, or govern∣ment fails, I am gone finally.</P>
<P>You gentlemen that may be called private creditors, let me in∣treat of you to make use of every method to come at your rights and money, besides law. If it is a matter of dispute submit it to reference. If it is clear debt, exercise patience, bear and forbear with your poor debtors. Let nothing but the utmost necessity, let me say extremity, drive you to distress mankind at this dole∣ful day. Cause not the cries of the poor and needy widow, fa∣therless and orphan children, to ascend up to Heaven against you for distressing them in order to obtain ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to lay out in toys, to adorn your and families bodies with. Remember, O remember, a judgment day to come.</P>
<P>And now to you gentlemen debtors. I would have you remem∣ber those scripture sayings owe no man any thing, pay to all their dues. See that you pay to all their just dues, as fast as possible. If you have not cash turn out any thing you can pos∣sibly spare; yea, offer all you have to your creditors; and sure∣ly, if they are christians, and endowed with humane hearts, if they see you thus willing to distress yourselves to pay them, they will nobly refuse it and grant you longer day. Use them well, give them good language, and if possible deceive them not. Practice industry and good oeconomy, for a creditor has hawk's eyes; and do not love to see their debtors struting about in fine rigging at their expence. Above all, remember the golden rule, do to all men as you would have them do to you again.</P>
