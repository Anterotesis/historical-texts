<HEAD>THE HAPPY EFFECTS OF UNION, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>MATTHEW xii. 25.</BIBL>
<Q>"<HI>Every kingdom divided a∣gainst itself is brought to desolution; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS is an observation made by HIM who, by way of eminence, is most justly stiled TRUE and FAITHFUL. The special occasion of it was this: while our blessed REDEEMER was in the world, employed about his Father's business, at a certain time there was <Q>brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind and dumb; and he healed him, in so much that the blind and dumb both spake and saw, and all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the Son of Da∣vid? But when the Pharisees hear'd it, they said, This fellow doth not cast out devils but by Beelzebub, the prince of the devils. And JESUS knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Eve∣ry kingdom divided against itself, is brought to desolution, and every city or house divided against itself, shall not stand. And if satan cast out satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand? And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore they shall be
<PB N="8" REF="014805_0007_0F94DC75FA446D78"/>
your judges. But if I cast out devils by the spirit of GOD, then the kingdom of GOD is come unto you. Or else, how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house. He that is not with me is a∣gainst me; and he that gathereth not with me, scattereth abroad.</Q> The miracle which our SAVIOUR here wrought was indeed a notable one; giving to one that, under the influence and pow∣er of a devil, was both blind and dumb, the pow∣er both of seeing and speaking immediately. It excited the attention of the people, and filled them with wonder and surprize, and brought them at once to quere, "Is not this the son of David?" i. e. the promised and expected MESSIAH. But the Pharisees his crafty and bitter enemies and op∣posers not being able to deny the fact, or discre∣dit the reality of the miracle, which was so great and visible; or, bring the author of it into disre∣pute any other way, with equal absurdity and malice attribute it to diabolical intercourse and influence. Our SAVIOUR refutes this vile aspersi∣on, by shewing that it is founded on the folly and unreasonableness of supposing that satan, that craf∣ty deceiver, should lend him his power to pull down his own kingdom and work effectually a∣gainst himself: that it is supposing satan divided against himself and engaged for his own destructi∣on. Besides, if they attributed the miracle he had wrought to the devil, he asks them, by whom do your children cast out devils? There were certain Jews amongst themselves that cast out devils in the name of the GOD of Abraham, Isaac and Ja∣cob,
<PB N="9" REF="014805_0008_0F94DC76CD2BA4A0"/>
and it was acknowledged that they did it by the power of GOD: and there was no cause sepa∣rate from their malicious views and designs why they should not acknowledge that what he did was by the same power. And, says he, if I cast out devils by the spirit of GOD, then the kingdom of GOD is come unto you, i. e. the MESSIAH is come, and the miracles which I work prove my divine mission and character. And further, he uses a∣nother argument to prove that the miracles which he wrought were by the power of GOD, and not by the help of Satan, which is this; that it requires greater strength than Satan is possessed of, to con∣quer and overcome him, and effectually counter∣act his influence, and dispossess him of his domini∣on. He is the strong man that reigns in this world or his house; he is stiled the GOD of this world, and no power but that which is truly di∣vine, no strength but that of Almighty GOD, can bind him and destroy his kingdom. He has too much subtilty to do any thing himself to destroy it, the promised seed, the glorious MESSIAH only can do it, and effectually bruise his head. And all mankind are to be ranked in two classes; and are either the subjects of CHRIST, the KING of ZION, and through him the children of GOD; or they are the subjects of Satan, the God of this world, who ruleth in the children of disobedience. The former are free indeed, being made free by the SON of GOD, and are disposed and engaged to promote the interest of CHRIST'S kingdom, which consisteth in <HI>righteousness and peace and joy in the</HI> HOLY GHOST; and which bears the most friendly aspect upon the happiness of mankind. The latter are the slaves
<PB N="10" REF="014805_0009_0F94DC77878C57B0"/>
of sin and Satan; our SAVIOUR says of them, <HI>Ye are of your father the Devil, and the lusts of your fa∣ther ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him.</HI> They are engaged in the interest and belong to the kingdom of Satan, and their temper and conduct is inimical to the temporal and eternal happiness of mankind. And both these classes of men are perfectly known to HIM, who thus distin∣guishes and characterizes them in the context: <HI>He that is not with me is against me, and he that gathereth not with me, scattereth abroad.</HI> And when we see the HOLY JESUS while exercising his miraculous pow∣er in infinite mercy and kindness to men, loaded with undeserved reproach, and unreasonable, mali∣cious calumny; and his most benevolent actions misconstrued and asserted to be owing to the influ∣ence of the Devil, we are not to wonder that the greatest and best of men, exerting themselves most in the way of their duty, and for the good of others, often meet a similar treatment, and have all their benevolent and faithful efforts attributed by wick∣ed, malicious and designing men, to the most ab∣surd and diabolical motives, especially as he him∣self hath said <HI>The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his Lord. It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his Lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his houshold?</HI></P>
<P>HAVING said thus much of the original occasion and design of the observations in the text; and of the sacred passage so immediately connected there∣with, we proceed to a more particular considerati∣on and improvement of it, or a theme of discourse
<PB N="11" REF="014805_0010_0F94DC783A63FB98"/>
pertinent to the important business of this day, and the alarming state of public affairs.</P>
<P>EVERY <HI>kingdom divided against itself, is brought to desolution; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand.</HI></P>
<P>THE truth of this observation carries its own e∣vidence with it, and immdeiately approves itself to the rational and considering mind. Two contrary powers, of any kind whatever, that act against and oppose each other, can have no other tendency but to destroy each other's force. And the greater the force they oppose to each other, the greater and more speedy the mutual destruction which they oc∣casion. This is illustrated and verified in the na∣tural and material, as well as moral and rational, world, and holds true (not like the declaratory right of the British Parliament to make laws to bind the colonies, but in reality) <HI>in all cases what∣soever.</HI> And in all bodies of men and civil com∣munities whether great or small, whether consider∣ed as kingdoms, provinces, cities, towns, or still lesser societies, even particular private houses, and families, their strength and stability is in proporti∣on to their union; and disunion and division among them have the most fatal and destructive tendency. In proportion as these increase and rage, ruin ad∣vances. They severally bring kingdoms to deso∣lution, and no city or house can flourish, or even subsist long under their baneful influence. Rag∣ing and contending factions ever have been, and forever must be, the ruin of those among whom they rise and rule. The greatest and most power∣ful kingdoms and states are brought to desolution by them, while much lesser bodies are preserved,
<PB N="12" REF="014805_0011_0F94DC78FAAF48F0"/>
and their interest, power and prosperity wonder∣fully increased, by union, harmony and good a∣greement, with their strength all employed in one design for mutual and universal good.</P>
<P>IN this way have gone to ruin many nations and people of past ages, which were once great and flourishing, and chief among the nations, and ma∣ny once small and very inconsiderable states, and by them oppressed or greatly dispised, have suc∣ceeded to, even exceeded all their greatness, grandeur and glory. Division and discord brought desolation upon the former; union, concord and perseverance secured the prosperity and happiness of the latter. To union many a flourishing state hath owed its greatness, and its downfal to divisi∣on. Concord and perseverance advanced <HI>Rome</HI> to the height of its glory: And discord and faction sunk it in debasement and ruin. The final over∣throw of the <HI>Jewish</HI> nation, the desolation of their capital city, their temple and their country, was chiefly brought on by their divisions and factions; and they did ten times more to their own undoing than all their foreign enemies and invaders.</P>
<P>WE see the observation in the text exemplified, universally, in all instances without exception, as far as history or our acquaintance with kingdoms, cities or houses divided against themselves can in∣form us. And worldly wise, ambitious and de∣signing statesmen, are so well apprized of this truth, that it is long since a maxim with them, when they would weaken, enslave or ruin a peo∣ple (if not likely to be easily done by open vio∣lence and force) to do it by exerting and fomenting divisions among them.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="014805_0012_0F94DC79BA7587C8"/>
AND by the successful practice of this policy many have reached the summit of iniquitous gran∣deur and power, and been the most awful scourges to mankind. DIVIDE and TYRANNIZE is the stirrup by which they mount, and hold the seat of their ill-gotten authority; and the goad too or spur with which they unmercifully lash on those deluded and oppressed by them, wasting all their substance and wearing out their very lives, merely to gratify their own despotic will and pleasure.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> both in the Southern and Northern parts of it; and the king∣dom of <HI>Ireland</HI> subjected with them to the <HI>British</HI> crown, have all in their turns, been shaken to their foundations, with internal divisions, which have been excited, fomented and guided by arbitrary de∣signing men, and spread ruin and desolation all around. Since the political union of the two king∣doms of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland, Great-Britain</HI> hath more than once been so unhappily divided against itself, as to appear evidently brought to the brink of desolation, and inevitably falling into it, had not a speedy end been put to such a division; or a <HI>glorious revolution</HI> taken place, through the kind in∣terpotion of divine providence.</P>
<P>AND such appears to be the unhappy divided state of the nation at present, and her power and force so much and directly employed against her own interest and strength, that without some great and essential alteration of measures, and a timely happy revolution of affairs, ruin is inevitable; the power and glory of <HI>Britain</HI> sunk; and her name, if not lost, only preserved to reproach her with what she once was, and might still have
<PB N="14" REF="014805_0013_0F94DC7A859707C0"/>
been, had it not been for her own wicked and wanton abuse of the favours Heaven blessed her with: And being servilely subjected to some fo∣reign power, she may be forced too late, to rue her present measures and conduct; and herself experi∣ence those slavish chains which she is now forging for <HI>America;</HI> whose numerous and gallant sons, had they been treated by her as they ought to have been, as justice and her own interest required, would always have been bound to her by affection and duty, and when properly called to her assis∣tance, would have most cheerfully adventured their lives and fortunes, for her protection, defence, and real interest and honour, and under providence rendered her superior to all her enemies.</P>
<P>SHE may one day, and that day not be very far off neither, want the help of her affectionate colo∣nists whom she hath butchered and plundered.</P>
<P>BUT those she hath cruelly slain can rise no more for her help: And with what an ill grace will she call upon those who survive, whom she hath stri∣ven all in her power to weaken and oppress, beyond the power of helping themselves?</P>
<P>AND the following observations of an elegant English writer of the present age, may not be im∣pertinent to our subject, or unapplicable to the past and present state of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and what, in a human view, is likely to be her future fate; or unimproveable by us.</P>
<P>"IN such a world as this, all things are in per∣petual change, rotation and revolution: It is na∣ture's process. As the summer and winter gradu∣ally succeed and encroach upon each other, or as the sun dawns and arises from darkness till he reach∣es
<PB N="15" REF="014805_0014_0F94DC7B50668450"/>
the mid-day fervour of his culminating beam, and thence declines till he sets, in utter darkness; even so mighty nations, as well as families, have their commencement, ascent and summit, declen∣sion, decay and period. The virtue of all nations and families begins in poverty, thence arises to in∣dustry, genius, honour, perhaps to conquest and empire; there is their zenith; but then comes on the load of pondrous wealth that gradually weighs them down from this meridian to indulgence, sen∣suality, guilt, corruption, prostitution, slavery, perdition."</P>
<P>WE in this country, at the present day, have every thing to induce us to cultivate union, and guard against divisions among ourselves. Whate∣ver is most dear and valuable, in this world, to millions now living, and will be so to all the milli∣ons of their posterity after them, till the world shall be no more, is at stake. The prize contend∣ed for is the LIBERTY of <HI>AMERICA.</HI></P>
<P>THE strife whether this vast continent, extend∣ing in length and breadth more thousands of miles, than <HI>Great-Britain</HI> extends hundreds, shall be ac∣knowledged as an appendage to that island three thousand miles distant from it; and subjected to the arbitrary government of a set of men, at such a distance, when interest and humour may lead them perpetually to prey upon the property and happi∣ness of this country, nature, reason, <HI>common sense</HI> re∣volts at the thought. We desire not to deprive them of their rights and privileges, their country and posses∣sions; or to have their property, or any part of it at our arbitrary disposal: But wish them prosperity and happiness in the right use and improvement of them
<PB N="16" REF="014805_0015_0F94DC7C04F397E8"/>
all. And there is all reason that they should do the same to us. But how different, in reality is their dis∣position and conduct. By the force of arms they are trying to reduce us to a state of absolute sub∣jection to them; and have wantonly and impi∣ously resolved that they have a right to make laws binding us <HI>in all cases whatever,</HI> a right belonging to no man nor body of men, and to no being, in the whole universe, nor to be trusted in the hands of any one, but of GOD <HI>the great Creator and sovereign Pro∣prietor</HI> of all things, who is unerring in wisdom and infinite in justice, goodness and all perfection. They have unrighteously begun the quarrel, and unsheathed the sword, and driven us to the sad ne∣cessity of taking up arms for our own defence and protection.</P>
<P>CRITICAL, uncommon and peculiar as the cir∣cumstances are, which brought on, and have hi∣therto attended, the unnatural contest, into which we have been reluctantly forced, Heaven hath wonderfully united the hearts of this country, and in the midst of the most crafty and unwearied efforts to sow divisions amongst us, preserved and increased the union, and crowned the exertions and enterprizes of the people of <HI>America</HI> with great and continued success: And in many instances and res∣pects, through the special interposition of divine providence, with very unexpected and surprizing success.</P>
<P>ALL such things are omens for good, demand our thankfulness, and encourage us to prosecute the virtuous struggle, in humble dependance upon GOD, till he shall be pleased to extricate us out of our troubles.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="014805_0016_0F94DC7CBB7BBCC8"/>
THE martial spirit that hath been excited, among all ranks and ages throughout this vast continent; the readiness with which men have willingly offered themselves in the service of their country; the chearfulness with which fond parents and rela∣tives, part with their children and friends, and encourage and spirit them to go forth in the de∣fence and for the protection of our rights and pri∣vileges, is a happy presage of desired success. We have felt, we now feel, and I trust posterity will ever feel the happy effects of the CONTINENTAL UNION which hath taken place, and hath been hitherto (and we hope always will be) cherished and preserved. It is owing to this that we are not reduced, by all the policy and power of our ene∣mies to that abject, dependant, oppressed and sla∣vish state which they aimed at, but have made a noble and virtuous, a laudable and effectual resis∣tance, the effects of which they feel, and long must feel, to their own great mortification, disappoint∣ment and irreparable loss. They affected at first to treat our union and efforts for the preservation of our country, with contempt and ridicule; our union, said they, would be but as a rope of sand; our attempts to resist, altogether folly and mad∣ness. And to intimidate us, the fleets and armies of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> have been conjured up in imagi∣nary representation, more powerful and formida∣ble than they really are, or ever have been, or ever can be, and marshalled for our destruction.</P>
<P>WE find them not unassailable, not invulnera∣ble, not immortal; not altogether incapable of fear and being put to flight, and that a very has∣ty one too; but in every encounter our brave coun∣trymen
<PB N="18" REF="014805_0017_0F94DC7D87A87AD0"/>
have had with them upon any thing near equal terms, as to number and circumstantial advanta∣ges, our men have been constantly victorious, and conquered the enemy, and made them yield or re∣tire, with shame and loss. Tis true the war is ca∣lamitous: For the most righteous and prosperous war is so on many accounts: But that our country∣men are as capable of all the exercises and fatigues of war, and as bold to face danger in all its forms, as any men need to be, or indeed can be; not to mention a great variety of heroic actions, in the several parts of <HI>America,</HI> by sea and land during the present struggle; the single march to <HI>Quebec,</HI> through such a length of trackless, inhospitable wilderness, at so late a season; the gallant attempt our little army made upon that strong fortress; and though repulsed, yet supporting themselves, and maintaining the siege of the city, in that fro∣zen climate, at the coldest season of the year; and all this against numbers vastly superior to them, lodged in the walls and enjoying all the accommo∣dations of a fine city. These things, I say, to e∣verey impartial and unbiassed observer, must exhibit the martial prowess, the courage, fortitude and per∣severnce of <HI>Americans</HI> in the most respectable light.</P>
<P>THE heroic General MONTGOMERY, and the brave men who fell with him, enjoy, as they just∣ly deserve, the grateful tears of their country; and will be remembered with love, honour, grati∣tude and admiration to the latest posterity. The near relatives of the gallant men, who have thus nobly bled for their country, are honoured by their relation to them, and whatever reason there
<PB N="19" REF="014805_0018_0F94DD960423DC38"/>
may be to mourn their own and their country's loss, yet they justly derive consolation from a view of their character which they have left behind them, and of that peaceful rest and glory which they hopefully now enjoy. May GOD who hath the residue of the spirit raise up others in their stead to make up the gap, and may <HI>America</HI> ever have and cherish in her arms, champions and defenders of like spirit and bravery.</P>
<P>BUT should we fall into divisions and contenti∣ons among ourselves, the consequences are certain∣ly fatal; a complication of the most dreadful ca∣lamities will involve us in inevitable ruin, we should soon be so weakened as to fall an easy prey into the hands of those who are seeking the abso∣lute dominion and mastery over us.</P>
<P>THE resistance already made to their despotic de∣signs and power, hath exasperated them to the most cruel pitch, and what we have to expect from them, if left to their mercy, may be conjec∣tured, from what hath already been felt, where their vengeance hath been permitted to extend to execution. <HI>Falmouth, Charlestown, Boston</HI> and <HI>Nor∣folk,</HI> all our maritime places accessable to them; their spreading fire and sword, and desolation, wherever they could, give us the most signal and convincing evidence that their "tender mercies are cruelty." And should any be so base as to submit to them in all their claims, the most they can expect is to hold their lives and properties (if they can be said to have any) at their mere plea∣sure; and after they have been made the wretched instruments of helping to destroy their brethren and fellow countrymen, to be themselves last de∣voured.
<PB N="20" REF="014805_0019_0F94DD96C4794768"/>
With respect to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> the mother country, so called, upon the plan of conduct she hath of late years adopted towards the colonies; and pursued with incessant ardor and unrelenting fury, amity is lost and confidence forfeited, and if the plan be continued, <HI>lost and forfeited forever.</HI> If she be a mother, she is an unnatural, mons∣trous one, who, if she doth not forget, yet shews she hath "no compassion" upon her children, but rather delights in their blood.</P>
<P>The murderous sword, with all the wantonness of cruelty and revenge, in instances too many, is already bathed in their blood. And if we were once subdued to her will, and should be subjected to the controul and power of her exasperated, bru∣tal soldiery, such cruel and dreadful scenes would take place, as every good and benevolent man, unable to prevent them, might well desire to hide himself from the sight of, in the dark and silent mansions of the less cruel grave.</P>
<P>NOTHING but union and firmness will prevent our desolation, and effect our deliverance; and in no other way can a reconciliation and connection between the two countries take place that will be of any desirable or happy consequence.</P>
<P>AND providence hath blessed us with the means, and calls upon us, by a virtuous example, to shew and convince the world, that tamely to submit to the arbitrary, lawless, oppressive claims, of kings or courts, when the rights, welfare and happiness of the people are at stake, is so far from being a duty, that it is <HI>sin,</HI> and the contrary is indispensi∣ble duty, and every one is called upon to make a resolute, virtuous resistance.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="014805_0020_0F94DD977B39BA58"/>
AND if a just sense of duty in this respect was impressed upon all minds,
<Q><L>" No servile tenets would admittance find,</L>
<L>Dectructive of the rights of human kind;</L>
<L>Of pow'r divine, hereditary right,</L>
<L>And non-resistance to a tyrant's might;</L>
<L>For sure that <HI>all</HI> for <HI>one</HI> should thus be curs'd</L>
<L>Is but great natures edict just revers'd."</L></Q></P>
<P>IRELAND, had remained seperate and indepen∣dant to this day, unsubjected to the crown of <HI>Bri∣tain,</HI> had it not been for the fatal divisions, ani∣mosities and contentions, which took place among themselves. The manner in which they were subdued, and the treatment they have met with since, hold up sufficient beacons for our warning. Divisions were created and fomented among them, by <HI>British</HI> intrigues, and their own arms made use of against themselves. Not want of cou∣rage, or gallant conduct, or resources among them∣selves: But want of union in their councils and measures, left them a prey to the ambition and ty∣ranny under which they have so long and greatly suffered. And in rivetting the chains which hold them, the most crafty policy hath been made use of. Under the name of a kingdom and a parlia∣ment of their own, they have been cajoled and bribed into subjection to the <HI>British</HI> court; and brought under foreign influence; and the people, under the specious pretence of being governed, ac∣cording to the genuine principles of the English constitution, chusing their representatives and tam∣ing
<PB N="22" REF="014805_0021_0F94DD9846CD45A0"/>
themselves by virtue of such representation, have been cruelly restricted in their trade and ma∣nufactures, saddled with pensions, squeezed, fleec∣ed and oppressed into wretchedness, and the wick∣ed and venal parricides of their country, and idle pampered <HI>British</HI> pensioners, riot and fatten upon their misery.</P>
<P>LONG since have their honest, sensible men and true patriots, of which they have had a worthy and respectable number, who for learning and virtue would do honour to any nation under Hea∣ven, with virtuous indignation beheld, unravelled and opposed all the wicked manoeuvres of such ar∣bitrary and enslaving measures: But all their zeal and influence hath never yet been sufficient to ex∣tricate their country.</P>
<P>THE chains once rivetted are not easily shaken off, and the <HI>British</HI> administration is always care∣ful, by the various arts of bribery and corruption, to gain over to its interest a venal majority. This is equally the case with the parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland;</HI> and the people ('tis plain as sunbeams) are ruined by representatives of their own chusing, and what is stranger still, buy their ruin with their own money.</P>
<P>IRELAND, no doubt (such is the knowledge, spirit and virtue of many of her sons) had long ago been effectually aroused and emerged from such a wretched state of vassalage, had it not been for her local circumstances, being an island so near <HI>Bri∣tain,</HI> accessible on all sides to her fleets, and conti∣nually watched at all points, by her internal ene∣mies and domineering neighbours. Her friends have sighed and groaned, and in all the ways they
<PB N="23" REF="014805_0022_0F94DD9902FF26A0"/>
could, have vented their just resentment. And when of late the ministry of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> equally their and our enemies, applied to their parliament to lend their assistance and send their troops, by butchery and force to subjugate <HI>America,</HI> while the venal majority obsequiously complied; with what justness of sentiment, zeal for liberty, and the unalienable rights of mankind; indignation at what they themselves have already suffered, and may further suffer, and by such mean compliance, be instrumental in bringing upon themselves; and with what force of rhetorick and affecting pother in their speeches do they expose and oppose the measures of the ministry with respect to this coun∣try? Their souls seem to breathe in their senti∣ments, and their hearts to flow out with their ex∣pressions. And we should take the warning to take care of ourselves, while we may, and by a firm union and virtuous resistance, keep off the chains which are forging for us. If we submit, we do it with our eyes open, and against the most plain and solemn warnings; against the sentiments and ardent hopes and faithful remonstrances of the greatest and best men in both the kingdoms of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>AND our Continental Congress, composed, per∣haps, of as wise, worthy and learned a set of men as ever convened on earth (and this is not saying so much of them as the great and wise Lord CHAT∣HAM, once Mr. PITT, the patriotic, beloved mi∣nister of the nation, and instrumental, in the hand of providence, of the greatest blessing to Britain and America, hath expresly and publicly said of them.) I say, this respectable Congress, whose
<PB N="24" REF="014805_0023_0F94DD99C5B41158"/>
members are chosen by the free voice of the peo∣ple, whose interest and all is at stake with our own, and who by their station, and the important trust reposed in them by their constituents, as they stand in the front of danger themselves, and have the best advantages for framing a right judgment; and have all the united motives of duty and in∣terest to incite them to the greatest watchfulness, zeal and fidelity in the cause of their country; have all along been wise and faithful, to spy out and warn us against the snares and dangers to which we have been exposed; and to point out to us a plain and sure way, under the blessing of providence, for our relief and safety. We are refused the privileges of Englishmen, and unjust∣ly commanded, and the <HI>British</HI> arms are employ∣ed to bow our necks to the yoke of slavish sub∣jection.</P>
<P>PROVIDENCE hath blessed us on this <HI>continent,</HI> with all the resources which we could ever desire, in a united, virtuous improvement of which, to be a free and happy people. Not exposed to the disadvantages of a little island, surround∣ed on all sides with ocean, and under the imme∣diate eye of jealous arbitrary power, we inhabit a <HI>vast continent,</HI> which, in itself, yields to the diligent and virtuous industry and invention of the inha∣tants, <HI>all things</HI> necessary for their subsistence, com∣fort, protection and defence.</P>
<P>IF we are not a free and happy people, it will be our own fault, and owing to the abuse of the light and advantages providence hath blessed us with: and the present struggle, if not maintain'd with union and perseverance, till crown'd with
<PB N="25" REF="014805_0024_0F94DD9A8BDB7238"/>
success, but dropt through our own divisions, or timidity, will render this country, to all future ages, instead of an asylum for persecuted liberty, instead of the envy of slaves and tyrants, instead of the boast, happiness and glory of freemen, a shame and reproach through all the earth.</P>
<P>OH, then, may this truth be ingraven in indeli∣ble characters on every heart among us, a truth approved of by reason, and experimental observa∣tion, and sanctified by all the authority of divine revelation, UNITED, WE STAND, BUT DI∣VIDED, WE FALL.</P>
<P>ALREADY do the avaricious courtiers of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> with the numerons train of their needy dependents and hangers-on, with the whole tribe of dissolute spendthrifts, and idle deboshee's, feast themselves with the prospect of possessing the fruits of our past industry, and the spoils of our future earnings, and if once subjected to them, we should find them greedy and insatiable, like the <HI>daughters of the horse-leech, crying, Give, give,</HI> and like <HI>the three things, yea, four, which say not, it is enough. The grave, and the barren womb; the earth, that is not filled with water, and the fire that saith not, it is enough.</HI></P>
<P>'TWAS for this that our fore fathers fled from the persecution and tyranny of the age they lived in, and braved every danger and difficulty, to seek out and settle this distant, and then wilderness country. They sought a peaceful retreat for them∣selves and posterity, in which to enjoy the blessings of liberty and religion. They from their graves, or rather "from the battlements of heaven," call upon us to preserve and cultivate the fair inheri∣tance
<PB N="26" REF="014805_0025_0F94DD9B4901C170"/>
they so dearly purchased and left us; and posterity will most reasonably expect that we transmit the same, undiminished to them; and our own happiness depends upon the enjoyment and improvement of it.</P>
<P>REASON and religion, every argument and mo∣tive, that can influence a rational and pious mind, call for the dutiful exertion of all our united powers, to defend, protect and improve the rights, liberties and privileges with which GOD, in his pro∣vidence, hath so richly blessed us, against all foes and invaders whatsoever.</P>
<P>THE controversy in which we are engaged, is, in its nature and consequences, of the greatest impor∣tance. A struggle of the kind, of such magnitude and so interesting and extensive in its influence, hath as yet no place in the history of mankind. Things new and strange, dark and perplexing, things at one and the same time most critical and interesting, and such as must be acted upon, and must influence our conduct, and affect the public, often lie in our way; and no wonder in many in∣stances men differ in sentiment, even the wise and good, and as true friends to their country as any it can boast: Tis much rather a wonder that in such a strange perplexed state as we have been thrown into, the difference hath not been much greater.</P>
<P>THIS teaches us the wisdom and great necessity of mutual forbearance and condescention towards one another; of guarding against all irritating, re∣proachful language and injurious conduct; and aiming constantly at what we, in our best judg∣ment
<PB N="27" REF="014805_0026_0F94DD9BFB45DBD0"/>
think is for the greatest welfare of our country. In the pursuit of this our HEARTS and HANDS should be united, and if we cannot be perfectly agreed in all particular measures, yet we should so keep the grand end in view, as to aim in all our wishes and conduct at that; and thus bury all uncomfortable and hurtful contentions among ourself, and do nothing to <HI>provoke one another except to love and good works.</HI></P>
<P>AND the guilt and wickedness of that man is hardly to be conceived, who is disposed to take ad∣vantage of the times, and (under the specious pre∣text of aiming at the liberty and prosperity of his country) asperse characters, gratify his own re∣venge, or more personal self-interested views of a∣ny kind; or is willing to <HI>owe his greatness to his coun∣try's ruin.</HI></P>
<P>AND how absurd, inconsistent and malicious is the temper and conduct of those who impute all the exertions of our wisest and best men, in the cause of their country, to a spirit of faction, and self-interested and wicked motives and designs, and to any thing besides the good of their country? This has been done by those stiled <HI>the friends of go∣vernment,</HI> on both sides the water. And yet it is notorious to all impartial observers, that these our patriots are acting from the same principles and motives, with the greatest and best men the nation could ever boast, and who are acknowledged by themselves to have been the truest friends to her rights, liberties and happiness; and in defence of these and opposition to tyranny, some of them no∣bly bled; and by means of their virtuous strug∣gle,
<PB N="28" REF="014805_0027_0F94DD9CC16DB900"/>
the nation has enjoyed so much liberty and happiness as it has.</P>
<P>DOES not this comprize the absurdity and malice of the ancient pharisaical spirit? They act like true patriots, they venture life and their ALL in the cause of their country, this cannot be denied, but then say our enemies, they aim not at the good but the ruin of their country: <HI>just as well may Sa∣tan cast out Satan.</HI></P>
<P>IT is peculiarly our happiness in this colony, that in the midst of the perplexed state of affairs through the country, our civil polity and form of government hath been and yet continues compleat. And we have reason to think it hath had a very extensive happy influence through the whole con∣tinent. And never did the freemen of it, need such wisdom, steadiness and integrity in their conduct as at the present day.</P>
<P>WE need a just sense of the importance and hap∣py effects of union; and of the malignity and fatal influence of divisions, and of the solemn oath of GOD which is upon us; and this, and this alone, will enable us to discharge a good conscience; and thus doing is the only way in which we can hope for the direction and blessing of Heaven.</P>
<P>I ADD no more, but pray ALMIGHTY GOD to bless what hath been spoken agreeable to truth, and cause it to have a genuine, practical influence upon us all.</P>
