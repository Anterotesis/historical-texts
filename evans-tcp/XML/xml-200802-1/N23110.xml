<HEAD>On the Reality, Beauty Importance, and Necessity of Religion.</HEAD>
<P>A Few days after the archbishop of Paris and his vicars had set the example of renouncing their clerical character, a rector, from a village on the banks of the Rhone, followed by some of his parishioners, with an of∣fering of gold and silver saints, chali∣ces, rich vestments, &amp;c. presented himself at the bar of the convention.</P>
<P>The rector, a thin venerable man, with grey hairs, was ordered to speak.</P>
<P>I come, said he, from the village of ******, where the only good build∣ing standing is a very fine church.—My parishioners beg you will take it, to make an hospital for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sick and
<PB N="10" REF="030546_0004_0FE7BA4A30862A38"/>
wounded of both parties, they being both equally our countrymen. The gold and silver part of which we have brought to you, they intreat you will devote to the service of the state, and that you will cast the bells into cannon to drive its foreign invaders. For myself, I am come, with great pleas-use to resign my letters of ordination, of induction, and every deed and ti∣tle by which I have been constituted a member of your ecclesiastical polity. Here are the papers; you may burn them if you please, in the same fire with the genealogical trees and patents of nobility. I desire, likewise, that you will discontinue my salary. I am still able to support myself by the labour of my hands; and I beg you to believe that I never felt sincerer joy than I now do in making this renuncia∣tion. I have longed to see this day; I see it, and am glad.</P>
<P>When the old man had done speak∣ing, the applauses were immoderate. The rector did not seem greatly elated with those tokens of approbation; he retired back a few steps, and thus re∣sumed his discourse.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="030546_0005_0FE7BA4F56CD7E70"/>
Before you applaud my sentiments, it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> you should understand them; perhaps they may not entirely coin∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> with your own. I rejoice in this day not because I wish to see religion degraded, but, because I wish to see it exalted and purified.</P>
<P>By dissolving its alliance with the state, you have given it dignity and inde∣pendence. You have done it a piece of service—a service which its well∣wishers would perhaps never have had courage to render it, but which is the only thing it wanted to make it appear in its genuine beauty and lustre.</P>
<P>Nobody will now say of me, when I am performing the offices of my religion, it is a trade; he is paid for telling the people such and such things; he is hired to keep up a useful piece of mum∣mery. They cannot now say this,? and therefore I feel myself raised in my own esteem, and shall speak to them with a confidence and frankness, which, before this, I never durst ven∣ture to assume.</P>
<P>We resign without reluctance our gold and silver images and embroider∣ed vestments, because we have never
<PB N="12" REF="030546_0006_0FE7BA97ECDD0FC8"/>
found that looking upon gold and sil∣ver made the heart more pure, or the affections more heavenly; we can also spare our churches, for the heart that wishes to list itself up to God will never be at a loss for a place to do it in; but we cannot spare religion, be∣cause, to tell you the truth, we never had to much occasion for it.</P>
<P>I understand that you accuse us priests of having told the people a great many falsehoods. I suspect this may have been the care, but till this day we have never been allowed to en∣quire whether the things which we taught them were true or not. I cannot but hope, however, that the errors we have fallen into have not been very material, since the village has in general been sober and good; the peasants are honest, docile, and laborious; the husbands love their wives, and the wives their husbands; they are fortunately not too rich to be compassionate, and they have con∣stantly relieved the sick and fugitives of all parties whenever it has been in their way. I think, therefore, what I have taught them cannot be so very amiss.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="030546_0007_0FE7BA98F89BE5C8"/>
You want to extirpate priests, but will you hinder the ignorant from ap∣plying for instruction, the unhappy for comfort and hope, the unlearned from looking up to the learned? If you do not, you will have priests, by whatever name you may order them to be called; but it is certainly not ne∣cessary they should wear a particular dress, or be appointed by state letters of ordination. My letters of ordina∣tion are my zeal, my charity, my ar∣dent love for my dear children of the village: If I were more learned I would add my knowledge, but alas! we all know very little; to a man ev∣ery error is pardonable but want of hu∣mility. We have a public walk, with a spreading elm-tree at one end of it, and a circle of green round it, with a convenient bench. Here I shall draw together the children as they are playing around me. I shall point to the vines laden with fruit, to the orchards, to the herds of cattle lowing around us, to the distant hills stretch∣ing one behind another, and they will ask me, how came all these things? I shall tell them all I know, or all that
<PB N="14" REF="030546_0008_0FE7BA9C176C8560"/>
I have heard from the wise men who have lived before me; they will be penetrated with love and veneration; they will kneel and I shall kneel with them; they will not be at my feet, but all of us at the feet of that Good Be∣ing whom we shall worship together, and thus they will receive into their render minds a religion.</P>
<P>The old men will sometimes come, from having deposited under the green sod one of their companions, and place themselves by my side. They will look wishfully at the turf, and anxiously enquire is he gone forever? shall we soon be like him? will no morning break over the tomb? when the wicked cease from troubling will the good cease from doing good? We will talk of these things, I will com∣fort them.—I will tell them of the goodness of God, I will speak to them of a life to come; I will bid them hope for a state of retribution.</P>
<P>You have changed our holydays;—you have an undoubted right, as our civil governors so to do; it is very im∣material whether they are kept once in seven days or once in ten: some,
<PB N="15" REF="030546_0009_0FE7BA9D21B929D8"/>
however, you leave us, and when they occur, I shall tell those who chuse to hear me, of the beauty and utility of virtue, of the dignity of right conduct.</P>
<P>There is a book out of which I have sometimes taught my people; It says, we are to love those who do us hurt, and to pour oil and wine into the wounds of the stranger. In this book we read of a person called Jesus;—some worship him as God: others, as I am told, say it is wrong so to do:—some teach that he existed before the beginning of ages, others, that he was born of Joseph and Mary.</P>
<P>I cannot tell whether these contro∣versies will be ever decided; but in the mean time, I think we cannot do otherwise than well in imitating him, for I learn that he loved the poor, and went about doing good.</P>

<HEAD>THE NEGRO</HEAD>
<P>"Alas I am saint and feeble," said a voice which misery seemed to have rendered almost inarticulate. They were the words of a poor negro, who, oppressed by the heat of the sun, (for
<PB N="16" REF="030546_0010_0FE7BAA039D73488"/>
the day was hot and sultry) in a lan∣guid posture, was enjoying a short res∣pite from his labors. "Curse on Eu∣ropean avarice that deals in cargoes of wretchedness, and thrives by the traffic of despair," I exclaimed the very mo∣ment my imagination caught the picture. "Perhaps," said I, "this child of sorrow has been torn from a father—a mother." Nature must have pleaded very loudly against his captivity; for I thought I could perceive the tears of affection standing in his eyes, "Or, perhaps, he has looked forward, with eager expectation, to the days he seemed destined to pass with the com∣panion of his youth; and now"—I thought on thee, Eliza, the partner of my life, and I endeavored to di∣vert my thought from the gloomy read they were pursuing; but in vain. My captive spoke still louder.</P>
<P>"I once was happy," said he, "When I lived beyond these great waters, I heard not the yells of des∣pair; the gale rung not with the shrieks of the wretched. Our but was in a cool valley, beneath the shade of the losty palm trees. My labours
<PB N="17" REF="030546_0011_0FE7BAA1496ACC10"/>
then were sweet, for I feared neither stripes nor master. My work in the fields provided my father with food, and he repaid with smiles the toil of his sons. All was joy, all was pleas∣ure. Strong and cheerful, I hailed the breezes of the morning; at noon I bathed in the stream, and in the eve∣ning joined the happy dance in the meadow. But now—"I loved, alas! the beauteous Yoncha, She was the theme of every song, the envy of surrounding virgins. For her <HI>I</HI> sought and made two heroes bow at my feet. The maid of my heart trembled for my safety, and hailed my victory with the smiles of rapture. I brought her the clustered bannanas. From my hand, she said they were more luscious. For her I climed the airy cocoanut tree, and threw into her lap the milky fruit. In the chase, she nerved my arm with strength and inspired, my breast with courage.—Then I smiled on danger; <HI>I</HI> heeded not death. <HI>I</HI> attacked the indignant foe in his den. Though his eyes glistened with anger. <HI>I</HI> pierced him and he bled for Youcha. <HI>I</HI> carried home the spoils of the battle,
<PB N="18" REF="030546_0012_0FE7BAA46381FB28"/>
and placed them in her bower.—But now, alas! she bleeds for her lost warrior. She hears not his groans. He pines in slavery, he lingers for the stroke of death. Ah, me? the deep ocean divides us—Methinks the breezes that play on the surface of the waters, might waft her a sigh or a prayer. <HI>I</HI> have often asked them, but they seem not to regard me.</P>
<P>"We were dancing on the green in the evening, and we dreaded not the hour of danger. But the tall ship anchored in the stream, and treachery lurked for our captivity. <HI>I</HI>n vain we wept—The whites heed not the sigh of the negro. They know not the treasure <HI>I</HI> have left behind me. She may yet be safe!—<HI>I</HI> recall the scenes of pleasure <HI>I</HI> partook with her, and memory adds new horrorr to despair. <HI>I</HI> have toiled till my hand is feeble. <HI>I</HI> must, therefore, expect more lashes. The white men are very powerful; for their Gods are stronger than ours. They are not appeased by the sighs of the negro. Our labors are bitt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es but they furnish a rich sweet for our masters."</P>

<HEAD>The IDLER.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An Oriental TALE.</HEAD>
<P>AS <HI>Ortogrul of Basia was one day wandering along the streets of Bag∣dat, musing on the varieties of merchan∣dize which the shops offered to his view, and observing the different occupations which busied the multitudes on every side, he was awakened from the tranquility of meditation by a crowd that obstructed his passage. He raised his eyes and saw the chief vizier who had returned from the di∣van, and was entering his palace. Orto∣grul mingled with the attendants, and being supposed to have some business for the visier was permited to enter. He surveyed the spaciousness of the apartments, admired the walls hung with golden tapestry, and the floors covered with silken carpets, and despised the simple neatness of his own little habitation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Surely said he to himself this palace is the seat of happiness, where pleasure suc∣ceeds to pleasure, and discontent and sorrow can have no admission. Whatever nature has provided for the delight of sense is here spread forth to be enjoyed,
<PB N="20" REF="030546_0014_0FE7BAA88FE6A208"/>
what can mortal wish or imagine which the master of this palace has not obtained? The dishes of luxury cover his table, the voice of harmony lulls him in his bowers: he breathes the fragrance of the groves of java, and sleeps upon the down of the cygnets of Ganges. He speaks, and his mandate is obeyed; he wishes and his wish is gratified; all whom he sees obey him, all whom he hears flatters him. How different, Ortogrul is thy condition, who art doomed to the perpetual torment of unsatisfied desire, and who hast no amuse∣ment in thy power that can withhold thee from thy own conviction. They tell thee that thou art wise, but what does wisdom avail with poverty? None will flatter the poor, and the wise have very little power of flattering themselves. That man is surely the most wretched of the sons of wretchedness who lives with his own faults and follies always before him, and who has none to reconcile him to himself by praise and veneration. I have long sought content and have not found it; I will from this moment endeavour to be rich.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Full of his new resolution, he shut himself in his chamber for six months, to deliberate how he should grow rich: he sometimes proposed to offer himself as
<PB N="21" REF="030546_0015_0FE7BAA99B0E3D30"/>
counsellor to one of the kings of India, and sometimes resolved to dig for diamonds in the mines of Golconda. One day after some hours passed in violent fluctuation of opinion, sleep insensibly seized him in his chair: he dreamed that he was ranging a desart country in search of some one that might teach him to grow rich; and as he stood on a hill shaded with cypress, in doubt whither to direct his steps, his father appeared on a sudden, standing before him. Ortogrul, said the old man, I know thy perplexity, listen to thy father. Cast thine eye on the opposite mountain. Orto∣grul looked and saw a torrent tumbling down the rocks roaring with the noise of thunder, and scattering its foam on the impending woods. Now, said his father, look upon the valley that lies between the hills. Ortogrul looked, and espied a well out of which issued a small rivulet. Tell me now, said his father, dost thou wish for sudden affluence, that may pour upon thee like the mountain torrent, or for a slow and gradual increase, resembling the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill gliding from the well. Let me be quickly rich, said Ortogrul let the golden stream be quick and violent. Look round thee, said his father once again Ortogrul looked and saw the channel of the torrent
<PB N="22" REF="030546_0016_0FE7BAACB8DEA3B8"/>
dry and dusty, but following the rivulet from the well, he traced it to a wide lake which the supply, slow and constant, kept always full. He waked and determined to grow rich by silent prosus and industry.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">AN AFRICAN TALE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE><HI>By</HI> M. FLORIAN.</BYLINE>
<P>IF, as the Persians assert, we might believe that the universe is in subjec∣tion to two principles, of which one does the little good which is conspi∣cious, and the other the evil every where so abundant, we would be inclined to believe that Africa is the place where the evil principle, in a particular man∣ner, exercises his power. No portion of the globe produces such variety of poisons, so many wild beasts and veno∣mous reptiles. The little which we know of the history of Morocco, of the Negroes of Adra, of Jaggas, the native inhabitants of the coasts, as far as the country of the Hottentots, bears a remarkable resemblance to the natural history of lions, panthers, and serpents, which are so worthy of partaking this parching region with these cannibal Princes which sell and eat the flesh of their prisoners. In the midst of these disgusting and horrible scenes, where
<PB N="24" REF="030546_0018_0FE7BAB189CCB290"/>
some sell their children, and others eat their captives, we sometimes, may dis∣cover traces of natural justice, of gen∣uine virtue, of constancy in suffering, and a generous, contempt of death. These examples, rare as they may be are sufficient to interest us in this de∣graded part of the human species, to make us remember that they still are men: just as in a barren desart, a few solitary blades of verdure, which the traveller is from time to time delighted to discover, suffice to convince him that he still treads upon the earth.</P>
<P>IN the kingdom of Juida, situated on the coast of Guinea, beyond the Cape of three points, and not far from Sabi, its capital, there lived, in the year 1727, a poor widow, named Darina; she was the mother of three sons, whom she had brought up with a tenderness fortunately common in human nature, but very uncommon in the climates where children are considered as an ar∣ticle of trade, and sold for slaves by their unfeeling parents. The oldest of these were called Guberi; the second Teloa; and the youngest Selico. All of these were amiable and sensible; they adored their good mother, who, now
<PB N="25" REF="030546_0019_0FE7BAB3142EB7B0"/>
grown old and infirm, lived only by their industry. The wealth of this fam∣ily consisted only of a hut, in which they lived together, with a little field contiguous, the maize of which was their support. Every morning, taking it by turns, one of the three brothers went to the chace, another worked in the field, the third remained at home with their mother: in the evening they met, the huntsman produced his par∣triges, parrot, or perhaps a little ho∣ney; the husbandman brought fuel, whilst he who stayed at home provided their common meat. They supped af∣fectionately together, contending who should be most attentive to their mother: they received her blessing, and reclin∣ing upon straw, by the side of each other, they went to sleep expecting the morrow.</P>
<P>SELICO, the youngest of the breth∣ren, went often to the town to carry the first fruits of the harvest, the offering of this poor family, to the temple of the great divinity of their country. This god, it is well known, is a huge serpent of that species which are not venomous and do no injury; on the contrary, they destroy those serpents
<PB N="26" REF="030546_0020_0FE7BAB6DA463A10"/>
which are venomous; and they are so venerated at Juida, that it is considered as a horrible crime to put one to death. Thus the number of these sacred ser∣pents has multiplied without end, in the midst of their towns and villages, and, even within houses, one meets, at eve∣ry step, these deities, who come fa∣miliarly to feel at the tables of their worshippers, sleeping near their fires, and producing their young upon their beds; which last is considered by them at the happiest of omens.</P>
<P>OF all the Negroes of Juida, Selico was the blackest, the best made, and the most amiable. In the temple of their great deity he had seen the young Be∣rissa, daughter to the Chief Priest, who, by her figure, her beauty, and her grace, was far superior to all her companions. Selico conceived a passion for her, and was beloved in return. Every Friday, the day sacred amongst the Negroes to repose and religion, the young lover ap∣peared at the temple, passed the day in the society of his dear Berissa, told her of his mother, his tender passion, and of the happiness they should enjoy when united in marriage. Berissa did not appear to conceal that she equally
<PB N="27" REF="030546_0021_0FE7BAB80D1C9528"/>
desired this moment to arrive; and the venerable Farulho, her father, who approved of the connection, promised, with embraces, soon to reward their tenderness.</P>
<P>AT length this period, so anxiously expected, drew nigh.—The day was fixed; the mother of Selico and the two brothers had made ready the hut for the young couple, when the famous Truro Audati, King of Dahomai, whose rapid victories have been celebrated even in Europe, invading the kingdom of Ar∣dra, exterminating the inhabitants, and advancing at the head of his formidable army, was checked only by the great river which bounded the realms of the sovereign of Juida. This last a week and timid Prince, governed by his wo∣men and his ministers, did not think even of collecting a few troops to op∣pose the conqueror. He believed that the deities of the country knew well enough how to defend the entrance, and carried to the banks of the river all the sacred serpents that could be got toge∣ther. The Prince of Dahomai, surprised and indignant at having only reptiles to combat, threw himself into the stream with his troops, and gained the opposite
<PB N="28" REF="030546_0022_0FE7BABBA3EEEDC8"/>
bank, and very soon these gods, from whom miracles were expected, were cut to pieces, roasted on the fire, and de∣voured by the conquerors. Then the King of Juida, thinking that nothing else could save him, abandoned his ca∣pital, and hastened to conceal himself in a remote island. The warriors of Au∣dati spread themselves every where, carrying with them fire and sword.—They burned the crops, towns, and vil∣lages, and massacred without mercy all that they could find.</P>
<P>TERROR dispersed the few inhabit∣ants who escaped the carnage. The three brothers, on the approach of the conquerors, had taken their mother on their shoulders and hastened to conceal themselves in the woods. Selico would not leave Darina whilst she was exposed to the smallest danger; but the moment he saw her in safety, trembling for the fate of Berissa, he flew to Sabi, to save or perish with her. Sabi was ta∣ken by the Dahomians. The streets flowed with blood! the houses were plundered and destroyed; the palace of the King and the temple of the serpent were nothing but smoaking ruins, cov∣ered with dead bodies, whose heads, ac∣cording
<PB N="29" REF="030546_0023_0FE7BABD272A7188"/>
to custom, the barbarian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had carried away. The wretched Selico in despair, and wishing for death, ventur∣ed many times amongst the soldiers in∣toxicated with brandy and blood! Eve∣ry where did Selico rush <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> scenes, seeking Berissa and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, pronouncing their names sorrowfully a∣loud, and unable to recognize their bodies amongst so many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> trunks!</P>
<P>AFTER dedicating five days to this terrible search, doubting not but that Berissa and her father had become the victims of the ferocious Dahomians, Selico determined to return to his mo∣ther. He found her in the wood where he had left her with his brothers. The fixed sorrow of Selico, his manner, and his wild looks, terrified this unhappy fa∣mily! Darina lamented his misfortune, and tried various consolations; to all of which her son was insensible. He refu∣sed all nourishment, and seemed deter∣mined to expire by famine. Guberi and Teloa did not attempt to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him by argument and reason, but they pointed to their venerable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who had neither house nor bread, nor any thing left her but her children.—
<PB N="30" REF="030546_0024_0FE7BAC0C4134DF0"/>
They demanded of him. <Q>whether at that sight he had not the courage to live?</Q></P>
<P>SELICO promised that he would, and forced himself to think of nothing but of dividing with his two brothers the tender attentions which they paid their parent. They plunged in to the woods, went still farther from Sabi, built themselves a hut in a remote val∣ley, and thought of supplying by the chace, the maize and the vegetables which they were without.</P>
<P>DEPRIVED of their bows and arrows, and of all their other necessaries, which they had no time to carry away, they soon began to feel the extreme of mise∣ry. Fruits were in these forests rarely to be found, where the prodigious number of apes were always prepared to dispute them with the three broth∣ers. The earth produced nothing but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. They had no instrument to turn, nor grain to plant it. The rainy season came on, and the horrors of famine attacked them. The poor mother al∣ways in misery, reclined upon a bed of dry leaves, was ready to expire, but without a complaint. Her sons, ex∣hibited by hunger, could no longer pen∣etrate
<PB N="31" REF="030546_0025_0FE7BAC1CE30E388"/>
the woods which were deluged every where: they laid traps for the little birds which came near their hut, and when they took one, which rarely happened, for they had no longer any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, they carried it to their parent, and presenting it to her, forced from her a fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e; but she would not eat it unless divided with her children. Three months passed without any promise of change to their miserable situation. Compelled at length to take some step, they held a consultation at the desire of Darina. Guberi proposed first they should penetrate as far as the coast, and sell one of their number to the first European they might meet; and to pur∣chase with the money, bread, maize, and instruments of agriculture, with which they might support their mother. The brothers replied to this, but with a melancholy silence—<Q>To seperate from each other for ever! to become the slaves of white men!</Q> the Idea drove them near to distraction. 'Which shall be sold?' cried Teloa, in a tone of grief. 'Lots must decide it,' repli∣ed Guberi. <Q>Let us place three stones of different sizes in this clay vessel, shake them together, and he who
<PB N="32" REF="030546_0026_0FE7BAC581E3EAD0"/>
draws the least, must be the unhappy person.—No, my brother,' interrupt∣ed Selico, the lot is already drawn. I am the most miserable of all; you forget that I have lost Berissa, and that you alone prevented me from dying, by saying I might be useful to my mother. Confirm what you have said—this is the time—sell me!</Q></P>
<P>GUBERI and Teloa attempted in vain to oppose the generous pur∣pose of their brother; Selico resisted their expostulations, refused to draw his lot, and threatened to go by him∣self if they would not accompany him; at length the two eldest gave way. It was agreed that Guberi should continue with his mother, and that Teloa should conduct Selico to the Dutch fort, where he should receive the price of his broth∣er's liberty, and that he should immedi∣ately return with the provisions which they wanted. When this was deter∣mined, Selico alone forbore to weep, but he found it difficult indeed to re∣strain them when he was to leave his mother, bid her an eternal adieu, em∣brace her for the last time, and what is more, deceive her by promising soon to return with Teloa, saying that they were
<PB N="33" REF="030546_0027_0FE7BAC7029F0158"/>
only about to visit their former habita∣tion, and to see if they could again take possession of it. The good old woman believed them, yet she could hardly tear herself from her sons arms; she trembled at the danger they were about to encounter: and, by an involuntary motion, ran after Selico the moment she lost sight of his person.</P>
<P>THE two brothers, of whom it could not be said which was most unhappy, in a short time arrived at Sabi. Mur∣der had then ceased, peace began again to smile, the king of Dahomai undis∣turbed possessor of the States of Juida, wished to encourage a commerce with Europeans, whom he invited to his city. Many English and French merchants were received at the Monarch's court, who sold them his numerous prisoners, and divided amongst his troops the lands of the vanquished. Teola soon found a merchant who offered him an hundred crowns for his young brother. As he hesitated, trembled in all his limbs, and disputed about this horrible bargain, a trumpet was heard, and a public cryer announced with a loud voice, that the king of Dahomai promised: our hundred ounces of gold to whoever would bring
<PB N="34" REF="030546_0028_0FE7BACA93CB3ED8"/>
him alive a young Negro, who the night before bad dared to profane the scraglio of the Monarch, and had escaped to∣wards the cast, from the pursuit of the guards. Selico heard the proclamation, made a sign to Teloa not to conclude his bargain with the merchant; and taking his brother aside, spoke to him thus, in a firm tone: <Q>You are come to sell me, and I wished that you should, in order to support my mother, but the small sum which this white of∣fers you cannot prove of material importance; four hundred ounces of gold will secure certain wealth for ever to you and Daria. You must get this my brother; bind me this moment, and carry me to the King as the guilty person whom he wants,—Be not alarmed, I know as well as you do what punishment I have to expect, I have calculated how long it will endure, it will not exceed an hour, and when my mother brought me forth she suffered more.</Q></P>
<P>TELOA trembling could make no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> with tenderness and af∣fection, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at the feet of Selico, embraced his knees, conjured him in the name of his mother, of Berissa, by
<PB N="35" REF="030546_0029_0FE7BACB9DE30040"/>
all he held dear, to renounce his terrible purpose. 'Of whom do you speak,' said Selico, with a severe smile. <Q>I have lost Berissa, and I wish to meet her again. I save my mother's life by my death, I make my brothers rich for ever, and I escape a slavery which might be protracted for forty years. My choice is made, press me no far∣ther, or I go and surrender myself; you will then lose all advantage by my death, and you will occasion misery to her to whom we owe our lives.</Q></P>
<P>AWED by the manner and the ac∣cent in which Selico pronounced these last words, Teloa ventured not to re∣ply; he obeyed his brother, went and got cords, bound his hands behind him, bathing the knots with his tears, and, making him walk before him proceeded to the King's palace.</P>
<P>STOPPED by the guards, he demand∣ed an audience of the King: he was an∣nounced and introduced. The King of Dahomai, covered with gold and pre∣cious stones, was reclining on a fear let sofa, his head resting on the bosom of his favori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, who were dressed in rich brocaded silks, but were naked from the waist upwards. His ministers and of∣ficers
<PB N="36" REF="030546_0030_0FE7BAD0AF887CD0"/>
superbly dressed, were prostrate twenty feet from him. The most va∣liant were distinguished by a collar of human teeth, each of which testified a victory. Many females with muskets on their shoulders guarded the door of the apartment. Large golden vases containing palm wine, brandy, and strong liquors, were placed at some distance from the King, and the hall was paved with the sculls of his enemies. 'Sovereign of the world!' cried Te∣loa, prostrating himself on the ground, <Q>I come in compliance with your sacred orders to deliver into your hands—.</Q> He could not finish, and his voice died away upon his lips. The King interrogated him, but he could make no reply. At length Selico be∣gan:</P>
<P>'KING of Dahomai,' said he, <Q>you see before you the guilty wretch who, induced by a guilty passion last night, penetrated the recesses of your se∣raglio. He who brings me here in chains was a long time my friend and I did not fear to trust him with my secret. Zeal for your service has pre∣vailed with him to violate his friend∣ship. He surprised me in my sleep,
<PB N="37" REF="030546_0031_0FE7BAD25A10F170"/>
has loaded me with chains, and comes to demand the reward; give it him for the miserable man has deserved it.</Q></P>
<P>THE King, without vouchsafing any answer, made a sign to one of his of∣ficers, who, viewing the prisoner, gave him into the custody of the female guards, and paid Teloa the four hun∣dred ounces of gold. This last, taking the gold, the touch of which agonized his soul, went and purchased provisions; and, precipitately leaving the town, made hade to his mother.</P>
<P>ALREADY, by order of the Prince, they were making ready the horrible punishment to which they are doomed who commit adultery with the wives of the sovereign. Two large trenches are sunk at a small distance from each other. In that which is intended for the guilty female, they fix the unfortunate culprit to a stake, and all the women of the seraglio, clothed in their most sumptu∣ous dresses, carrying in their hands large vessels of boiling water, advance to the found of tabors and flutes, to pour this water upon her head till she expires. The other trench contains a pile of wood, upon which they place a cross
<PB N="38" REF="030546_0032_0FE7BAD5ED0FD7C8"/>
bar of iron, which is supported by two raised stakes. To this bar the criminal is secured, fire is set to the pile and the wretched creatures pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sh after pro∣tracted torments, being only reached by the extremities of the flame.</P>
<P>THE place was filled with people; the troops under aims formed a square, beating their spears and muskets; the priests, in their dresses of ceremony, waited for the two victims to lay their hands upon them and devote them to death. They appeared from different corners, guarded by the armed females. Selico, calm and resigned, advanced with his head raised up. When he came towards the stake he could not a∣void lifting his eyes towards the com∣panion of his misery. What was his astonishment and grief on beholding Berissa! He uttered a loud cry, and would have darted to her, but was with∣held by the executioners. Soon his first emotion gave way to indignation—'Wretch! that I am,' he cried, <Q>whilst I courted death, hoping again to meet her, she was amongst these vile fe∣males who contend for a tyrant's affections. Not content with her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in love, the was also faithless
<PB N="39" REF="030546_0033_0FE7BAD7B2444170"/>
to her master; she deserved the tide of adultress, and the punishment of her crime. Oh, my mother! for thee alone I die—it is on thee alone that I can bear to think!</Q></P>
<P>At this instant the wretched Berissa recognizing Selico uttered a loud scream; she called the priests, and declared to them aloud, that the young man they were about to kill, was not he who had penetrated the seraglio. She swore this by the heavens, by the mountains, the thunder and the most august of the sacred serpents. The priests intimidated, ordered the execution to be suspended, and ran to inform the king, who was himself present. Indignation and fury distur∣bed the countenance of the monarch when he approached Berissa.—'Slave!' said he in a terrible voice—<Q>thou who contemnest the love of thy master, thou whom I wouldst have raised to the rank of my first sultana, and who in spite of your refu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al, I have suffered to live, what is your purpose in pretending to deny the guilt of your accomplice. Dost thou wish to save him. If this be not thy
<PB N="40" REF="030546_0034_0FE7BADB6E905578"/>
lover, name who he is—deliver the guilty to my justice, I will release the innocent!</Q></P>
<P>'King of Dahomai,' replied Beris∣sa, who was already secured to the fatal stake, <Q>I cannot accept thy heart I possess not my own; I did not fear to tell you so. Do you think that she who would not live to share a crown, would speak a falshood at the moment of death! No, I con∣fess all, and repeat my refusal. A man did last night enter my apart∣ment, he did not leave it till the morning—but this was not the man! You ask me to name him, I ought not, I will not; I am ready to die; I know that nothing can save me, and I only protract the fatal moment to prevent you from perpetrating a crime. I again swear to you, king of Dahomai, that the blood of this innocent person will fall upon your head: deliver him, and punish me! I have no more to say.</Q></P>
<P>The king was struck with Berissa's words, as well as with her manner of pronouncing them. He gave no or∣ders, but reclining his head, was astonished
<PB N="41" REF="030546_0035_0FE7BADCF0EBBA38"/>
at the reluctance which he this moment felt to shed blood. But re∣membering that this negro had accu∣sed himself, and attributing to love, the interest which Berissa discovered for him, all his rage was rekindled. He made a sign to the executioners; the pile was lighted, the women ad∣vanced with their vessels of boiling water, when an old man out of breath, covered with wounds and dust, burst through the crowd, and suddenly threw himself at the feet of the king.</P>
<P>'Stop!' said he, <Q>I implore you stop; I alone am the guilty person; it is I who have burst through the walls of your seraglio, attempting the delivery of my daughter. I was once the high priest of the deity who was here adored. They tore my child from my arms, and conducted her to this palace. Since that time, I eagerly have sought an opportunity to see her again. This last night I penetrated to her apartment—in vain did she attempt to follow me, for your guards discovered us. I esca∣ped alone, notwithstanding the ar∣rows with which you see me pierced.
<PB N="42" REF="030546_0036_0FE7BAE017569C00"/>
I come to offer you your victim! I come to expire with her, for whom alone I desired to live!</Q></P>
<P>He had had hardly finished when the king commanded the priests to release the unhappy prisoners, and bring them before him.—He examined Selico, wishing to know what important mo∣tive could induce him voluntarily to seek so dreadful a punishment.</P>
<P>Selico, whose heart panted with joy at finding Berissa again, and faithful, was not afraid to reveal every thing to the Monarch. He related to him his misfortunes, the distresses of his moth∣er, and the resolution he had taken to obtain for her the four hundred ounces of gold. Berissa and her father heard him with tears of delight and admira∣tion: the chiefs the soldiers, and the people melted with tenderness: the king himself perceived tears to fall, which never before had bedewed his cheeks.—Such is the charm of virtue, that barbarians themselves adore it!</P>
<P>After hearing Selico, the king gave him his hand, and bade him rise, and, turning to the European merchants, whom this spectacle had collected,
<PB N="43" REF="030546_0037_0FE7BAE1224B7AE0"/>
'You,' said he, <Q>to whom wisdom, experience, and the illumination of a long civilization, have so long taught what is the specific value of a man, Of how much value think you is this?</Q> A young Frenchman more bold than the rest, exclaimed, <Q>Ten thousand crowns of gold!</Q>—<Q>Which shall be given to Berissa,</Q> said the king, <Q>with this she may purchase the hand of Selico.</Q></P>
<P>This order was executed on the spot, and the king of Dahomai retired, aston∣ished at feeling a delight he had never before experienced.</P>
<P>Farulho the very same day gave his daughter to Selico. The young cou∣ple, accompanied by the old man, departed next day with their treasure, to go in search of Darina. She, as well as the brothers of Selico, were ready almost to expire from joy.—This virtuous family separated no more, but well enjoyed their riches, and in a barbarous region, offered, for a long period, the fairest example which heaven could give to the earth—that of happiness and wealth pro∣duced by virtue.</P>

<HEAD>GOLDSMITH's Essay on the wis∣dom of Providence, in the con∣struction of nature.</HEAD>
<P>WHERE Taurus lifts its head a∣bove the storm, and presents nothing to the sight of the distant traveller, but a prospect of nodding rocks, falling torrents, and all the variety of tremendous nature; on the bleak bosom of this frightful moun∣tain, secluded from society, and de∣testing the ways of men, lived Asem the man hater.</P>
<P>Asem had spent his youth with men, had shared in their amusements; and had been taught to love his fel∣low creatures with the most ardent affection: but, from the tenderness of his disposition, he exhausted all his fortune in relieving the wants of the distressed. The petitioner never sued in vain; the weary traveller never passed his door; he only desisted from doing good, when he had no longer the power of relieving.</P>
<P>From a fortune thus spent in be∣nevolence, he expected a grateful re∣turn from those he had formerly re∣lieved, and made his application with
<PB N="45" REF="030546_0039_0FE7BAE550F6CDD0"/>
confidence of redress: the ungrateful world soon grew weary of his impor∣tunity; for pity is but a short lived passion. He soon, therefore, began to view mankind in a very different light from that in which he had before beheld them. He perceived a thous∣and vices he had never before expect∣ed to exist; wherever he turned, in∣gratitude, dissimulation, and treach∣ery, contributed to increase his de∣testation of them. Resolved there∣fore to continue no longer in a world which he hated, and which repaid his detestation with contempt, he retired to this region of sterility, in order to brood over his resentment in solitude, and converse with the only honest heart he knew, namely, with his own.</P>
<P>A cave was his only shelter from the inclemency of the weather; fruits gathered with difficulty from the moun∣tain's side, his only food; and his drink was fetched with danger and to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> from the headlong torrent. <HI>I</HI>n this manner he lived, sequestered from society, passing the hours in medita∣tion, and sometimes exulting that he
<PB N="46" REF="030546_0040_0FE7BAE8700FE4E0"/>
was able to live independently of his fellow creatures.</P>
<P>At the foot of the mountain, an extensive lake displayed its glassy bo∣som reflecting on its broad surface the impending horrors of the mountain. To this capacious mirror he would sometimes descend, and reclining on its steep bank, cast an eager look on the smooth expanse that lay before him. "How beautiful," he often cried, is nature! how lovely, even in her wildest scenes! How finely con∣trasted is the level plain that lies be∣neath me, with you awful pile that hides its tremendous head in clouds! But the beauty of these scenes is no way comparable with their utility: from hence an hundred rivers are sup∣plied, which distribute health and ver∣dure to the various countries thro' which they flow. Every part of the uni∣verse is beautiful, just, and wise: but man, vile man, is a solecism in nature, the only monster in the creation. Tempests and whirlwinds have their use; but vicious, ungrateful man, is a blot in the fair page of universal beauty. Why was <HI>I</HI> born of that detested
<PB N="47" REF="030546_0041_0FE7BAE979EBCDF8"/>
species, whose vices are almost a reproach to the wisdom of the di∣vine Creator! were men entirely free from vice, all would be uniformi∣ty, harmony and order. A world of moral rectitude, should be the result of a perfectly moral agent. Why, why then, O Alla! must I be thus confined in darkness, doubt, and des∣pair!"</P>
<P>Just as he uttered the word despair, he was going to plunge into the lake be∣neath him, at once to satisfy his doubts, and put a period to his anxiety; when he perceived a most majestic being walking on the surface of the water, and approaching the bank on which he stood. So unexpected an object at once checked his purpose: he stopped, contemplated, and fancied he saw something awful and divine in his as∣pect.</P>
<P>"Son of Adam," cried the genius, "stop thy rash purpose; the father of the faithful has seen thy justice, thy integrity, thy miseries, and hath sent me to afford and administer relief. Give me thine hand, and follow, without trembling, wherever I shall
<PB N="48" REF="030546_0042_0FE7BAEC9F3D1200"/>
lead. In me behold the genius of conviction, kept by the great Prophet, to turn from their errors those who go astray, not from curiosity, but a rectitude of intention. Follow me, and be wise."</P>
<P>Asem immediately descended upon the lake, and his guide conducted him along the surface of the water, till, coming near the centre of the lake, they both began to sink; the waters closed over their heads; they descend∣ed several hundred fathoms, till Asem, just ready to give up his life as inevit∣ably lost, found himself with his ce∣lestial guide in another world, at the bottom of the waters, where human foot had never trod before. His aston∣ishment was beyond description, when he saw a sun like that he had left, a serene sky over his head, and bloom∣ing verdure under his feet.</P>
<P>"I plainly perceive your amaze∣ment," said the genius; "but suspend it for a while. This world was form∣ed by Alla, at the request, and under the inspection of our great prophet; who once entertained the same doubts which filled your mind when I found
<PB N="49" REF="030546_0043_0FE7BAEDAA97F610"/>
you, and from the consequence of which you were so lately rescued. The rational inhabitants of this world are formed agreeable to your own i∣deas; they are absolutely without vice. In other respect, it resembles your earth, but differs from it in be∣ing wholly inhabited by men who nev∣er do wrong. If you find this world more agreeable than that you so lately left, you have free permission to spend the remainder of your days in it; but permit me, for some time, to attend you, that I may silence your doubt, and make you better acquainted with your company and your new habita∣tion."</P>
<P>"A world without vice! Rational beings without immortality!" cried Asem, in a rapture; "I thank thee, O Alla, who hast at length heard my petitions: this, this indeed will pro∣duce happiness, ecstacy and ease. O for an immortality, to spend it among men who are incapable of ingratitude, injustice, fraud, violence, and a thous∣and other crimes, that render society miserable!"</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="030546_0044_0FE7BAF0CCD01EF0"/>
"Cease thine acclamations," re∣plied the genius. "Look around thee; reflect on every object and ac∣tion before us, and communicate to me the result of thine observations. Lead wherever you think proper, I shall be your attendant and instruct∣or." Asem and his companion trav∣elled on in silence for some time, the former being entirely lost in astonish∣ment; but, at last, recovering his former serenity, he could not help observing, that the face of the coun∣try bore a near resemblance to that he had left, except that this subterranean world still seemed to retain its prime∣val wildness.</P>
<P>"Here," cried Asem, "I perceive animals of prey, and others that seem only designed for their subsistence; it is the very same in the world over our heads. But had I been permitted to instruct our prophet, I would have removed this defect, and formed no voracious or destructive animals, which only prey on the other parts of the creation." "Your tenderness for inferior animals is, <HI>I</HI> find, remarka∣ble," said the genius, smiling. "But,
<PB N="51" REF="030546_0045_0FE7BC05176E98A0"/>
with regard to meaner creatures, this world exactly resemble; the other; and, indeed, for obvious reasons; for the earth can support a more consider∣able number of animals, by their thus becoming food for each other, than if they had lived entirely on the vegeta∣ble productions. So that animals of different natures thus formed, instead of lessening their multitude, subsist in the greatest number possible. But let us hasten on to the inhabited coun∣try before us, and see what that offers for instruction."</P>
<P>They soon gained the utmost verge of the forest, and entered the coun∣try inhabited by men without vice; and Asem anticipated in idea the ra∣tional delight he hoped to experience in such an innocent society. But they had scarce left the confines of the wood, when they beheld one of the inhabitants flying, with hasty steps, with terror in his countenance, from an army of squirrels, that closely pur∣sued him. "Heavens!" cried Asem, "why does he fly? What can he fear from animals so contemptible?" He had scarce spoken, when he perceived
<PB N="52" REF="030546_0046_0FE7BC06A2E5EA08"/>
two dogs pursuing another of the hu∣man species, who, with equal terror and haste attempted to avoid them. "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his," cried Asem to his guide, "is truly surprising; nor can I conceive the reason for so strange an action," "Every species of animals," replied the genius, "has of late, grown very powerful in this country; for the in∣habitants, at first, thinking it unjust to use either fraud or force in destroy∣ing them, they have insensibly increased, and now frequently ravage their harmless frontiers." "But they should have been destroyed," cried Asem; "you see the consequence of such neglect," "Where is then that tenderness you so lately expressed for subordinate animals!" replied the genius, smiling; "I must acknowl∣edge my mistake," returned Asem: "<HI>I</HI> am now convinced that we must be guilty of tyranny and injustice to the brute creation, if we would en∣joy the world ourselves. But let us no longer observe the duty of man to these irrational creatures, but survey their connections with one another."</P>
<P>As they walked farther up the coun∣try, the more he was surprised to see
<PB N="53" REF="030546_0047_0FE7BC0BC21B2770"/>
no vestiges of handsome houses, no cities, nor any mark of elegant de∣sign. His conductor perceiving his surprise, observed, that the inhabit∣ants of this new world were perfectly content with their ancient simplicity, each had an house, which, tho' home∣ly, was sufficient to lodge his little family; they were too good to build houses, which could only increase their own pride, and the envy of the spec∣tator; what they built was for con∣venience, and not for show. "Atleast, then," said Asem, "they have neither architects, painters, or statua∣ries, in their society; but these are idle arts, and may be spared. How∣ever, before I spend much more time here, you should have my thanks for introducing me into the society of some of their wisest men: there is scarce any pleasure to me equal to a refined conversation; there is nothing of which <HI>I</HI> am so enamoured as wisdom." "Wisdom!" replied his instructor, "how ridiculous! We have no wis∣dom here, for we have no occasion for it; true wisdom is only a knowl∣edge of our own duty and the duty of
<PB N="54" REF="030546_0048_0FE7BC0DD5CA3F40"/>
others to us; but of what use is such wisdom here? each intuitively per∣forms what is right in himself, and expects the same from others. If, by wisdom, you should mean vain curios∣ity and empty speculation; as such pleasures have their origin in vanity, luxury, or avarice, we are too good to pursue them," "All this may be right," says Asem; but methinks I observe a solitary disposition prevail among the people; each family keeps separately within their own precincts without society or without inter∣course." "That indeed is true," replied the other; "here is no estab∣lished society; nor should there be any: all societies are made either through fear or friendship; the peo∣ple we are among are too good to fear each other; and there are no motives to private friendship, where all are equally meritorious." "Well then," said the sceptic, "as I am to spend my time here, if I am to have neither the polite arts, nor wisdom, nor friendship in such a world, I should be glad, at least, of an easy companion, who may tell me his thoughts, and to whom I
<PB N="55" REF="030546_0049_0FE7BC13767D5F10"/>
may communicate mine." "And to what purpose should either do this?" says the genius: flattery or curiosity are vicious motives, and never allow∣ed of here; and wisdom is out of the question."</P>
<P>"Still, however," said Asem, "the inhabitants must be happy; each is contented with his own possessions, nor avariciously endeavors to heap up more than his own subsistence; each has the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efore leisure to pity those that stand in need of his compassion." He had scarce spoken when his ears were assaulted with the lamentations of a wretch who sat by the way side, and, in the most deplorable distress, seem∣ed gently to murmur at his own mise∣ry. Asem immediately ran to his re∣lief, and found him in the last stage of a consumption. "Strange," cried the son of Adam, "that men who are free from vice should thus suffer so much misery without relief!" "Be not surprised," said the wretch who was dying, "would it not be the ut∣most injustice for beings, who have only just sufficient to support themselves, and are content with a bare subsistence,
<PB N="56" REF="030546_0050_0FE7BC150B8399F0"/>
to take it from their own mouths to put it into mine? They never are pos∣sessed of a single meal more than is necessary; and what is barely neces∣sary, cannot be dispensed with."</P>
<P>"They should have been supplied with more than is necessary," cried Asem; and yet <HI>I</HI> contradict my own opinion but a moment before: all is doubt, perplexity, and confusion. Even the want of ingratitude is no virtue here, since they never received a favor. They have, however, a∣nother excellency yet behind; the love of their country is still, I hope, one of their darling virtues." "Peace, Asem," replied the guardian, with a countenance not less severe than beau∣tiful, "nor forfeit all thy pretentions to wisdom; the same selfish motives by which we prefer our own interest to that of others, induce us to regard our country preferably to that of a∣nother. Nothing less than universal benevolence is free from vice, and that you see is practised here." "Strange!" cries the disappointed pilgrim, in an agony of distress; "what sort of a world am I introduced to? There is
<PB N="57" REF="030546_0051_0FE7C436571CCF20"/>
scarce a single virtue but that of tem∣perance, which they practice: and, in tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, they are no way superior to the very brute creation. There is scarce an amusement which they en∣joy: fortitude, liberality, friendship, wisdom, conversation, and love of country, all are virtues entirely un∣known here; thus it seems that to be unacquainted with vice is not to know virtue. Take me, O my genius, back to that very world which I have des∣pised; a world which has Alla for its contriver, is much more wisely form∣ed th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> that which has been projected by Manomet. Ingratitude, contempt, and hatred, I can now suffer; for perhaps I have deserved them. When I arraigned the wisdom of Providence, I only showed my own ignorance; hence for the let me keep from vice my∣self, and pity it in others."</P>
<P>He had scarce ended, when the genius, assuming an air of terrible complacency, called all his thunders around him, and vanished in a whirl∣wind. Asem, astonished at the ter∣ror of the scene, looked for his imag∣inary world; when, casting his eyes
<PB N="58" REF="030546_0052_0FE7C43C048A27B8"/>
around, he perceived himself in the very situation, and in the very place where he first began to repine and despair: his right foot had been just advanced to take the fatal plunge, nor had it been yet withdrawn; so instant∣ly did Providence strike the series of truths just imprinted on his soul. He now departed from the water side in tranquillity, and, leaving his horrid mansion, travelled to Segestan, his na∣tive city; where he dilligently applied himself to commerce, and put in prac∣tice that wisdom he had learned in solitude. The frugality of a few years soon produced opulence; the number of his domestics increased; his friends came to him from every part of the city; nor did he recieve them with disdain: and a youth of misery was concluded with an old age of elegance, affluence, and ease.</P>

surface of things—who speculates on life, without enquiring seriously into its nature or design—why mankind are so prone to dwell on the shades of a picture—why, in a retrospect of life, the mind pauses on scenes that impart no gaiety to the fancy, and awake no rapture in the heart? the answer is obvious: it is the law of our nature. The wisdom of heav∣en has thought proper, so to con∣stitute the hearts of many, as to render them most happy in the indulgence of that philosophic melancholy—that ten∣der pensiveness, which enobles the soul, while it depresses the spirits, and gives, beyond any circumstance on earth, a foretaste of those joys in heaven, "which the eye hath not seen—nor the car heard—neither has it entered into the heart of man to conceive." Influenced by this motive, it is, that I often wander back to past periods, that I recall, in imagination, scenes which were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nce painful in the extreme, and dwell upon them till my heart distends almost to bursting, and is only relieved by a torrent of deli∣cious tears.

<P>From the frequent endurance of this "sadness," produced by the recollec∣tion of past events, in moments of re∣tirement and dejection—and finding the remark of the wilest of men, jus∣tified by my own experience, "that by the sadness of the countenance, the heart is made better," I have come to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, of committing the substance of my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to writing.

Perhaps some friends across the Atlantic, may be interested in this literary bequest. And when they compare the once cheerful Amelia Seymour, with the unfortunate Ame∣lia Stanford, they will commiserate the devoted girl, will sympathize in her misfortunes, and be grateful on heav∣en for an exemption from similar ca∣lamities.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="030546_0055_0FE7C44560F0A9B8"/>
My father whose name was William Seymour, lived in the town of Bristol, in England, and followed mer∣chandise. In the early part of my life, he had been successful in business, and had prudently deposited a compe∣tency in the funds, in case of acci∣dents (to which trade is proverbially exposed.) He married early, and had several children, all of whom he lost young, expect an elder sister and my∣self. While my father was in the full career of success, my sister married a gentleman of fortune, family, ed∣ucation and benevolence. He lived on his income at no great distance from my father's, on a small but highly cul∣tivated estate.</P>
<P>When the moment arrived in which my sister was to part with the home where she had been reared, and from the dear connections who had hither to gladdened her existence—her heart sunk—her resolution vanished—she in∣sisted on my attending her—and mak∣ing one of her family, until she could, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> degree, lose the remembrance of home. I was young, but fifteen years of age,—and was pleased with
<PB N="62" REF="030546_0056_0FE7C44B1A2826D8"/>
the scene for its novelty. I accord∣ingly took my leave of home to stay a few weeks with my sister. Three months I passed with her in uninter∣rupted happiness. Time then had the doves wings, we received the highest attentions the neighbours could pay us, and, possessed as we truly were of "health, peace and competence" the poet's definition of happiness: in read∣ing, conversation, visits and work, we enjoyed life as highly as mortals could do.</P>
<P>But the tide was now to ebb, the scene was to undergo a change,—a change which first brought me to an acquaintance with sorrow and misfor∣tune. I was suddenly sent for home, my mother was said to be dangerously ill—she had taken a violent cold which brought on a pleurisy,—a high fever accompanied it—she became delirious, and her life was despaired of by the physicians. We arrived in time to be∣hold her a living mother. About the time we reached my father's house her disorder seemed to take a favorable turn—She became herself, she recog∣nised her children—and possessed her
<PB N="63" REF="030546_0057_0FE7C44CB2319818"/>
reason enough to give us her dying blessing and parting advice. "I feel, said she, my children, taking us in her arms, as she sat up in her bed, and em∣bracing us most tenderly, I feel the powers of nature failing,—my nerves are weakened, my heart has that aw∣ful fluttering which assures me of ap∣proaching death." Our sobs here in∣terrupted her address, but resuming the subject with a tremulous voice and an aspect in which heaven itself was seated, she continued, "the cold hand of death is already laid upon me—I feel an icy torpor creeping through my veins: let me tell my daughters all my heart ere it be forever too late.—To the goodness of God and the care of his divine providence I then recom∣mend you both—the God who has pro∣tected and guided the parent from in∣fancy to mature age, will not forget the offspring. Trust in him my child∣ren; and he will never betray your trust. Resort to him for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and comfort in moments of distress, and he will not refuse his assistance. He has promised to be a father to the orphan, and his promise is infallible. Commit
<PB N="64" REF="030546_0058_0FE7C453092DB758"/>
yourselves to him and he will amply supply the loss of that mother, whom I trust, he will in a few short moments receive to himself.</P>
<P>"The period that hath been allotted me in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> has not been very long. I have not yet reached my fortieth year. I trust, however, I have lived to some good purpose; I have through life con∣sidered the love and service of the Su∣preme Being as the first object to be de∣sired and armed at—and next to this, the happiness of my fellow creatures. In these principles, I hope my dear children will follow the example of an affectionate parent, and believe her (who has no interest to disguise the truth) that through life, you will find the love and service of your Mak∣er the most delightful employment you can be engaged in, and the surest road to solid happiness. In your intercourse with the world, you will find the plea∣sures of sense the great objects of de∣sire and of praise—the serious and use∣ful qualities of the heart, so warmly recommended by our Saviour, the topics of ridicule and too often of con∣tempt. But aim at acquiring an opin∣ion
<PB N="65" REF="030546_0059_0FE7C454927CE900"/>
of your own, formed on the word of inspiration, and the most judicious moral writers. This will be an an∣chor to keep your barks steady and firm, amidst the storms of controver∣sy, and the currents of popular opin∣ion.</P>
<P>"Be kind and charitable to all with whom you are in any wise con∣nected—endeavor to consider their in∣terest and happiness as your own.—Never lose sight of our Saviour's gol∣den rule, "of doing to others as you would that they also in like circum∣stances, should do unto you;" forgive their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and their errors—there is a noble and sweet satisfaction in for∣giving which elevated and refined souls only know. Never was there a more untrue maxim, than that "re∣venge is sweet:" to little and malev∣olent minds it may be so—it may seem so in the first gust of passion—but when anger has subsided and the mind reflects on the past, nothing is more painful to a good heart than to remember, that is has been the cause of an injury to another which it cannot repair.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="030546_0060_0FE7A6ECE46AA5A8"/>
"And believe me, my children, when you come to the situation in which you behold your mother now, the only parts of your life to which you will look back with pleasure, will be those in which you have relieved misery, and conferred happiness by do∣ing good:—and rest satisfied—but I feel a deadly sickness, my God support me in this last trial." Here a faintness seized her—she fell back, and—a gen∣eral shriek of horror pervaded the chamber—she opened her eyes,—they soon closed again—and with one deep groan her spirit returned to him who gave it.</P>
<P>The impressions made on the mind of us all, by such an event, may be pourtrayed by fancy but never by lan∣guage. My father who was a man of warm feelings, and a most affectionate disposition was in a degree frantic. He was still through the day: now and then he would break out into violent fits of weeping, which would subside again and leave him composed and me∣lancholly: but at night he had no soon∣er closed his eyes than he became wild and flighty. We were obliged to keep
<PB N="67" REF="030546_0061_0FE7C45A40D2F000"/>
a light in his room and to have a serv∣ant with him all night. He needed consolation but who could impart it?—we were all so depressed by the sud∣den misfortune, that neither could give comfort to the other.</P>
<P>For my own part, I felt myself so overwhelmed by the stroke, that my heart literally died within me. I felt for my own situation, but if possible I suffered more for my father's—I con∣sidered myself, indeed, as deprived of my best friend and instructress, I fore∣saw the loss I should sustain in the want of her advice and guidance: and I shuddered at the snares and dif∣ficulties I might be exposed to in ear∣ly life, thus destitute of her patronage, and society—but what were these, compared to my fathers feelings! to have the nearest friend of his bosom thus torn away—the friend he had early and long loved as himself—thus wrested from his arms forever—was a state of forlorn wretchedness from which human nature recoils and which he was not calculated to endure. In∣deed, such was the effect this had on him, that he closed his accounts—
<PB N="68" REF="030546_0062_0FE7C45BCDB0A768"/>
withdrew from business, and purcha∣sed a small country seat not far from his son-in-law's, to which he immedi∣ately retired.</P>
<P>On his first retreat his spirits utterly abandoned him—he lost the vivacity which once distinguished him, became fond of solitary walks, and was much alone in his chamber. Depressed as I was myself, I found it necessary to make exertions to draw him into con∣versation, and to prevent his mind from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ring over subjects that were too melancholy and dejecting.</P>
<P>My sister and my brother in law of∣ten visited us—and by their conversation and tenderness relieved my fath∣er's mind greatly of its depressive gloom—Time however, did more for him than our exertions: the traits of grief faded from his heart gradually—till within the compass of a year, he be∣gan at times to resume something of his former gaiety, and sprightliness yet shortly after a turn of gaiety he would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> into dejection. He was never sprightly without being after∣wards proportionally grave. He now began however, to find him∣self able to
<PB N="69" REF="030546_0063_0FE7C46175FA0DE0"/>
converse of my departed mother,—to recall her memory—to praise her vir∣tues—and to recommend them to my imitation. Indeed this was less ne∣cessary than he imagined; they had deeply impressed my mind, though I knew it not till she was gone.</P>
<P>I was not the only person however, with whom he conversed of his la∣mented wife. There was a neighbor∣ing widow lady who lived about half a mile from us, to whom he used often to unfold his heart and to disclose its sorrows—the heard him with attention, assented to the praises he bestowed on his lost consort—admired his affection and sympathised in his distress. At first he used to resort there but seld∣om: her society however, I found be∣came every day more necessary to him,—little did I at first imagine what would be the result of these visits:—but when he began to request me to visit her with him, I conjectured that his views extended further than ordi∣nary, friendship. Yet this idea was not an obvious one: for although the lady was apparently a discreet, amiable ma∣nageing woman, yet the disparity be∣tween
<PB N="70" REF="030546_0064_0FE7C46306A13460"/>
their ages, she being the older by several years, her singular want of beauty, her having two or three child∣ren, and being rather in low circum∣stances, would have led any one to be∣lieve she never could be my father's choice:—but heaven thought other∣wise—my father had fixed his heart upon the matter: and reason was to have the nothing to say on the subject.—He accordingly one day as we sat to∣gether at breakfast, in a very pensive mood, opened the plan and asked my opinion of the matter.</P>
<P>Apprized as I was in my own mind of his intention. I felt myself sud∣denly and extremely affected by the disclosure. I was obliged to rise and leave the room, a gush of tears suc∣ceeded, and relieved my heart; as soon as I had recovered myself, I re¦turned and pursuing the subject re∣quested he would pardon this invol∣untary piece of weakness—that I per∣fectly accorded with him in sentiment—"whatever, said I, will promote my dear father's happiness, I shall al∣ways readily acquiesce in. One pa∣rent is all I have now on earth, and
<PB N="71" REF="030546_0065_0FE7C468A9737340"/>
should I not wish to see him happy▪ kind and affectionate as he has ever been to me, what an ingrate should I be, in the smallest measure to obstruct his wishes. No, my dear papa, tho' my tears would seem to express dis∣satisfaction at your plan, that senti∣ment is the farthest from my heart. If mrs. L—be your choice, I will make her as dutiful a daughter as I trust I have been to you"—</P>
<P>At these words, my father could re∣strain himself no longer—he took me to his arms—he pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s'd me to his bo∣som—called me his dear affectionate little girl—we both wept profusely—till our utterance was stopp'd and we were both obliged to part, to conceal our mutual weakness. In a word, before many weeks had elapsed, my father again became a husband, and brought home his lady and her train, and was again, in possession (to all ap∣pearance) of as much happiness as his heart could contain—but widely differ∣ent was the situation of his daughter. Of little consequence in the family—slighted by my mother in law when∣ever my father was absent, and treat∣ed
<PB N="72" REF="030546_0066_0FE7C46A32F1D6F0"/>
rudely by her children—I confined myself much to my books and devotions—but would a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any time have cheer∣fully exchanged situations with the in∣dependent sempstress or mil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ner, whose daily bread was earned by the labor of their own hands.</P>
<P>I will now go back a few years, to trace a series of events that interested my heart, and became the innocent cause of all my subsequent misfor∣tunes. Some time before the mar∣riage of my sister, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me accident∣ally acquainted with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Stanford, who lived a few doors from my fa∣ther's house. Our disposition and taste being in a great degree similar, our frequent opportunities of seeing each other rendered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in a short time romantically intimate: a day could not pass but we must see each other: our hearts were laid ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to each oth∣er. Whatever little attention or ad∣miration either received, was made known to the confidant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>—our billets doux were all preserved, and mutu∣ally communicated; in short it would have seem'd like treason to friendship and tenderness in either to have con∣cealed
<PB N="73" REF="030546_0067_0FE7C46FE23A63E0"/>
any thought or weakness of the heart from her friend. Among other testimonies of miss Stanford's affection for me was the communication of the letters of a favorite brother. Their elegance were such as pleased my fan∣cy—and their warmth of expression such as touched my heart. My friend often gave me a description of her brother—repeating many little acts of his fraternal goodness—and in the e∣vent raised my curiosity highly to see him—I envied her those affectionate, and unmerited attentions she received. I tho't nothing could be more agreeable than to possess the whole heart of such a brother, and lamented that providence had denied me one from whose society and correspondence I might derive the same benefits and pleasures, that Julia Stanford did from those of her broth∣er Charles. While th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> young man was every day rising in my opinion, and my anxiety to see him encreasing—little did I imagine that Julia was en∣deavoring to transfuse into his bosom all the warmth of friendship for me, which she herself entertained.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="030546_0068_0FE7C4716DE02400"/>
After many weeks of tedious ex∣pectation, the vacancy at length came, when the students of the university were permitted to return to their res∣pective homes, to see their friends, and to procure whatever articles were necessary for use or convenience at the ensuing session. Charles Stanford, at the time assigned returned to his home. Julia his sister had been impatiently looking out for him in the morning, but being disappointed in the pros∣pects, she had requested me to pass the afternoon and evening with her as an object on which to rest her heart and rel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x her spirits. I must own that aware of her expectations, I took more pains in the decoration of my person this evening than usual; and wish'd secretly (though I durst not avow the sentiment of my own heart) that my pains might not be lost.</P>
<P>When I went to mr. Stanford's I found Julia pensive and alone. Her father was from home, and her moth∣er up stairs: she had all things pre∣pared for tea, and was sickening with impatience at the delay of her broth∣er.
<PB N="75" REF="030546_0069_0FE7C477156EA608"/>
My presence was an instant re∣lief to her. We sat down and began to chat seriously together: but were suddenly interrupted by a chaise s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>op∣ping at the door. Instantly a young man's voice was heard in the entry: Julia in a moment recogniz'd it to be her brother's: she flew to receive him: they met at the parlour door as she opened it—their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> seem'd to be unbounded. When the first trans∣ports of affection were over, and re∣collection had returned, she presented mr. Stanford to me as her "dear brother" and mentioned my name to him. We gaz'd on each other with a little confusion; and often as our eyes met each other's in the course of the evening, a transient blush seem'd to overspread he face of the youth. We were able however to exchange a few words: but finding that I laid a kind of restraint on the feelings of the brother and sister, I took an early leave of Julia, not, however, with her ready acquiescence, nor without a positive promise to come and spend the next day with her.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="030546_0070_0FE7C478A3211A60"/>
I was as good as my word; but I was in pain le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t I had assented too easily—lest mr. Stanford should think my visit in part on his account, though I was not dissatisfied to find the young man waiting to attend me to his sis∣ter's the next morning when I came from my dressing room into the par∣lour. We this day became more so∣ciable; and I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>und that the repre∣sentation give<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by his sister, was not beyond the truth. We pass'd our time, from this period till his return to the university, very pleasantly: we saw each other every day. Many de∣lightful rambles we took round the town—and to places of public resort—and I felt happy in finding our satis∣faction with each other daily increase.</P>
<P>As the day approached, on which Charles Stanford was to take his leave of Bristol for some months: and to repair to Oxford, I could observe he began to grow thoughtful and silent: he lost much of the cheerfulness he possessed on his first return from col∣lege, and devoted himself much to grave company. Just before he left home, he came to take leave of me,
<PB N="77" REF="030546_0071_0FE7C47E577CA260"/>
and as he said "to offer me his best wishes for my health and happiness." He seem'd much embarrass'd with the task, and kne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not how to proceed. When he rose to make his adieu, he could say nothing—his eyes were downcast as well as mine, once or twice we each had resolution to raise them—but on meeting both were con∣fused and embarrassed. Thus we stood for nearly five minutes. At length, taking my hand, he raised it with some difficulty to his lips—and at the same time left in the hand he thus took, a beautiful locket set round with pearl; on the one side of which, were the two letters C. S. worked I suppose with his own hair, on the other a youth approaching an altar, on which was written "sacred to friendship"—with a heart in his hand as an offering, and on the small sold of paper in which this present was wrapped, the following words were written—
<Q><L>Think not, Amelia, that my heart</L>
<L>(Though fate my person may remove)</L>
<L>With thy blest image e'er can part,</L>
<L>Or cease thy merits to approve.</L>
<L><PB N="78" REF="030546_0072_0FE7C47FE23E4410"/>
Thine eye can melt the coldest breast:</L>
<L>Thy smile can chear the drooping soul:</L>
<L>The one can rob the soul of rest—</L>
<L>The other every care control.</L></Q></P>
<P>Some time after Charles had gone, and the flutter of my spirits had sub∣sided, and when I was capable of re∣flexion, I began to ponder on these strange appearances—I was painfully dubious whether I acted properly or not in keeping this present—I more than once was on the point of sending it to his sister: but as this would have wounded the feelings of my Julia, and distressed Charles—and as it was intended only as a token of "friend∣ship" I concluded I might retain it.—Often after his departure did I resort to the drawer in which I had lock'd his gift, and many were the soft feel∣ings it occasioned to my heart.</P>
<P>After his return to the university, he wrote to his sister more frequently than ever. In every letter he either made some enquiries concerning miss Seymour, or sent some expression of friendship and recollection—I was pleased at heart with his attention—but never discovered it farther than to
<PB N="79" REF="030546_0073_0FE7C48594E482C0"/>
return him my compliments. With these at first he seemed satisfied—but with one act of attention, the wish for another arose, till at length he commissioned Julia, if possible, to gain my permission for him to write to me occasionally. This, however, I then refused.</P>
<P>During his stay this session at col∣lege, it was that my sister was marri∣ed and that I had left home to reside with her. When on close of his col∣legiate course, he returned to B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tol, and hoped to tread again the path he had pursued a few months before, his disappointment was great, to fine our family in part eloped and beyond the limits of frequent attentions. Julia, however, had promised me a visit at my brother-in-law's, and as soon as Charles had returned, she availed her∣self of his protection and company, and with him in a post chaise perform∣ed her promise. They passed a few days with us delightfully: our even∣ing rambles—our literary amusements through the day, the beauties of na∣ture, and the charms of vocal and in∣strumental music, often gave a
<PB N="80" REF="030546_0074_0FE7C4871C85B648"/>
brightness to our spirits—and a rap∣ture to our bosoms, that language could never paint.</P>
<P>Time, however, rolled away rapid∣ly—our friends left us—uncertain when we would meet again. We met, however, much sooner, and on a more melancholy occasion, than fan∣cy had conjectured—but a few weeks after this the sudden illness of our mother called us home—called us to a scene of the deepest woe I had ever witnessed. During all our affliction, on this event, however, the attention and sympathy of Julia Stanford and her brother, were a great source of relief and comfort.</P>
<P>They called every day to enquire af∣ter our health, and shewed a great degree of tenderness which engaged my warmest gratitude. When my father <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> retired into the country, after his severe loss, my mind soften∣ed by affliction, and left vacant by sol∣itude, was prepared to embrace any object which offered it relief. Charles Stanford continued his visits to my fa∣ther's as often as the distance, to which we had removed from Bristol,
<PB N="81" REF="030546_0075_0FE7C48CC9D6EFA8"/>
would permit: nor will it be a mat∣ter of wonder, that I was happy to see him—left alone almost continually, after my father's visits to our widow-neighbour commenced, and with a heart alive to all the feelings of friend∣ship, and preference, was it surpri∣sing that I should, from gratitude, pass to esteem and tenderness for a young man of Mr. Stanford's charac∣ter and disposition? for though young, he was discreet, and though he had mingled with the world, his manner's were free from levity and vice. He was grave tender and polite—he loved virtue and practised it. In point of address he was agreeable—his person was good, and his face expressed well the feelings of his heart. Of such qualities was mr. Stanford possess'd, when our acquaintance commenced—with these he made a tender of his heart and hand to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> par∣tial Amelia, at a time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> could make but a feeble resistance. While I live, I shall never forget <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> circum∣stances under which he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to me his sentiments—nor the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> then excited in my bosom.</P>

It was on one of those fine evenings of autumn, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the warmth of the day, the cool of eve becomes grateful to the sense—the sun was just sinking beneath the horrizon; and all was till and impress'd on the mind the sweetest pensiveness.

Mr. Stanford a while beheld this scene in silence: he then gave a deep sigh—and looking most tenderly in my face "alas" said he, "that happi∣ness should be so temporary and uncer∣tain"—"wherefore this reflexion, Charles," said!—"is <HI>your</HI> happiness exposed to danger?"—"Indeed," re∣turned he, "it is—it hangs on a slen∣der brittle thread.

"Ave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>"—said I, looking down (for I began from his looks and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> voice to suspect the drift of his con∣versation) "and surely no one would intentionally impair your happiness."—"No!" said he, his eye brighten∣ing as he spoke.

"That can∣not be," replied I withdrawing my hand from i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>—"your happiness, mr.

<PB N="85" REF="030546_0079_0FE7C49B41AEAA00"/>
a few minutes to my chamber. I gave full vent to the feelings of my heart, and presently returned to him quite composed. I found him walk∣ing the room with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in his hand and the tear still <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in his eye. I seated myself on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to which he immediately approached with a look of anxiety and sorrow, and seated himself by my side. He deli∣cately enquired whether or not he might continue what he had introdu∣ced: I could not return him an an∣swer—he then ask'd what construction he should put on my silence—"what you please, sir"—was all I could ut∣ter—he press'd my hand again to his lips, with great ardour. Our further intercourse at present was stopped by the sound of my father's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oot on the piazz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>—his entrance gave a little blush to our cheeks: indeed I felt as if I had committed some offence which merited disapprobation and punish∣ment. Mr. Stanford's looks express∣ed the same feeling—his tongue was mute. Scusible of the irksomeness of his situation, he presently after took his leave of us, and departed. All
<PB N="86" REF="030546_0080_0FE7C509E0487B08"/>
the ensuing night was I kept awake in revolving the scene that had taken place. Sometimes I was satisfied, and again out of temper with what had passed. On the whole, however, I was of opinion, that of all the youth I had ever been acquainted with, Charles Stanford was the one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st to my ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>—that his character, his talents, family and prospects in life were such as accorded with my tem∣per, and such as promised to render me as happy as the changing state of humanity admits.</P>
<P>On his next visit, he found me in the garden alone with my work and my book. He approached with his usual delicacy and diffidence: we talk∣ed sometime on general topics, ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the palpitations occasioned by such a meet∣ing, had subsided—when he again in∣troduced the subject, which, he said, "lay nearest his heart"—I now found myself more capable of expressing my sentiments than before—I told him that on a matter of such delicacy and importance as the present, I had ever conceived a gentleman was entitled to a speedy and candid explanation; that
<PB N="87" REF="030546_0081_0FE7A6FE8C4DEAE8"/>
he must have observed, from my man∣ner, that I had shewed him a prefer∣ence, above an ordinary acquaintance—that in candour now I would ac∣knowledge his merits had gained my esteem—but more than this! dare not say at present—that my father had a negative on my choice of a friend for life—and that his approbation must be obtained, before any further step could be taken.</P>
<P>Mr. Stanford understood me—his eye, his voice and his manner express∣ed his satisfaction—he said he would take the earliest opportunity of ob∣taining a parent's consent to his atten∣tions, in which if he were successful, he would indeed, be one of the most happy men in existence.</P>
<P>M. Stanford accordingly embraced the earliest opportunity of disclosing his wishes to my father. His embarrass∣ment, I doubt not, made him less elo∣quent in his own, than he could have been in the cause of a friend. My father also, as I discovered after∣wards, was not a little disconcerted—he was taken by surprise, and knew not what answer to make. To prevent
<PB N="88" REF="030546_0082_0FE7A706416383B8"/>
any future misunderstanding, he postponed giving a definitive answer—signifying, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ever, a general <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Stanford's character—but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to make an enqui∣ry into my friend's present situation, and future prospects. In these par∣ticulars he was soon satisfied. He found mr. Stanford, both before and since his return from Oxford, had been in a counting house; that his father design'd setting him up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n trade, under the patronage of a rich uncle, who was concerned in the East-India <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; that with the money himself could advance, and the advantages the uncle could put into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> son's hands, he might make a voyage to Bengal, and by residing there for a few years, might return with a complete inde∣pendency. This was the plan at first <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: and this was the plan our parents, after consulting together, a∣greed to adhere to. They believed that what they could both spare would be hardly sufficient to support us in the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in which we had been accustomed to live <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aving form∣ed this opinion, they would no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> de∣part
<PB N="89" REF="030546_0083_0FE7A70646042558"/>
from this first scheme. But in our apprehension, how absurdly did they appear to reason and resolve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>? We would have most cheerfully denied ourselves many of the little superflui∣ties to which we had been accustomed—We sighed not for opulence or dis∣tinction; a bare competency, and a retirement from gay &amp; fashionable life, was our mutual choice. Our hearts found their happiness in their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> society, and could surrender any thing that clashed with a speedy union.—Mr. Stanford, when he was informed of the scheme proposed by our pa∣rents, immediately avowed his disap∣probation of it—warmly, yet respect∣fully stated his reasons—urged the pain he should experience in parting with the single object that a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ched him to life <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a reason—and declared his preference of living in obscurity and indigence, rather than hazard his life, and be necessarily absent from all his friends for a number of years.</P>
<P>These reasons, proceeding from the warmth of the heart, had little influ∣ence on the minds of our parents, who called our attachment nothing but
<PB N="90" REF="030546_0084_0FE7C4A1F3013488"/>
a wild and foolish liking, that would soon be over, and leave us independence and in want if we were now suffered to be united. They therefore insisted on Mr. Stanfords setting off for India, by the first vessel that sailed for that quarter; and told him that when he had accumulated a for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>une<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, he might return and expect the hand of Amelia Seymour, with her parents approbation.—This determination was a sad bar to all our affectionate wishes—it was discordant with our o∣pinions and our feelings. After can∣vassing the subject for several days, and devising means of support in case we were abandoned by our parents, we at length came to a conclusion, and resolved, whatever might be the con∣sequence, to be united in hand as in heart—to live in a retired way—to be frugal and industrious—and to trust in God for welfare and happiness. A res∣olution of this kind, we were sensible would expose us to the derision of the worldly-wise; but we were not to be frightened by a shadow, from the posses∣sion of a reality. Nature had given us firmness enough to resist the influence
<PB N="91" REF="030546_0085_0FE7C4A381C46C50"/>
of a sneer—and we had learned from observation and experience, that what the mass of the world denominate happiness, is but misery in disguise. In truth, the greater part of mankind, are a set of shallow dupes. They have not discernment to distinguish between the semblance and the essence of hap∣piness—they make it consist in sensual gratifications, and keen pleasures, which ever cloy by frequent enjoy∣ment, and mostly leave a poison be∣hind. True happiness is seated only in the mind: without peace of con∣science and sound intellects, it is im∣possible to enjoy real and permanent satisfaction: and with a due observ∣ance of those duties we owe to our Maker, our neighbours and ourselves—altho property be denied, happiness may be attained—happiness of the most exalted, pure, and substantial kind.</P>
<P>Impressed with these considerations we prepared for the private solemnization of our naptials, as well as our circumstances would permit. I prepared all my clothes, on various pretences. I persuaded my father to advance some small sums of mon∣ey,
<PB N="92" REF="030546_0086_0FE7C4A8A5B99BA8"/>
which were expended on articles that I thought would be most useful to me. Mr. Stanford had been les<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a sum of two hundred fifty pounds by a remote relation: this he could command at any time, and this we believed would be sufficient to support us comfortably for a while, in case we should lose the patronage of our parents.</P>
<P>Thus circumstanced, I bribed one of the domestics to carry my trunk to a neighboring tavern, and while my father and mother were out visiting one evening, Mr. Stanford, agreeably to appointment, came to our house, and bore off his willing captive. I had scarcely left my home, be∣fore my heart sunk, and my conscience reproved me for the step I had taken—I had abandoned a roof that had long kind∣ly sheltered me—I had thrown myself from the protection of a parent who had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> crossed my wishes—and had put my ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>or and happiness into the power of a young man, where principles might be at variance with his past conduct, and who might, for all I could know, possess a disposition that would thwart every hope of my soul. But my trust was in heaven. What I did, could only be justified by the supreme law, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Creator has im∣planted in every human breast, of pursu∣ing its own happiness by every lawful
<PB N="93" REF="030546_0087_0FE7C4AA2F1F9170"/>
mean. I conceived that I felt the hand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> parental tyranny, not exercised in the way of advice or remembrance, but in the way of a law with a sanction. That our parents had a right to impose a com∣mand, under the penalty of displeasure, or of withholding property, we did not dispute; but in our apprehension, a slen∣der livelihood, gained by labor and fru∣gality, was preferable to a long and tedi∣ous separation, and the hazard of life.</P>
<P>In a word, we were joined in the bands of matrimony, and hastened to each oth∣er's affectionate embrace with an ardor proportioned to the risk we had run.</P>
<P>The day after the event took place, Mr. Stanford wrote to his parents and to mine informing them of what had taken place, and apologizing for the abruptness of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, from the strength of mutual attach∣ment, and the fear of being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from each other, by an immense distance, and an unknown length of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me.</P>
<P>How difficult a matter it is, for the a∣ged to recal the feelings of youth! How rare to meet with persons advanced in years, who can enter into the feelings and views of the young, and make just allowances for the rashness of inexperi∣ence! When this information reached our parents, all with one voice seemed to condemn our conduct; they reprobated
<PB N="94" REF="030546_0088_0FE7C4AF593A7F00"/>
our disobedience in harsh terms—and by the bearer of Mr. Stanford's letter, assu∣red us, it was their determination to give us no manner of assistance; but, as we had provoked our own fate with open eyes, to it they resigned us.</P>
<P>This answer, though severe and pain∣ful, was less so than it would otherwise have been, from our preparation for it. All we had now to do, was to adopt some plan, that would rescue us from the hor∣rors of poverty, and enable us to cultivate and constantly enjoy that interchange of affectionate endearments, for which we had renounced almost every thing beside. The wide world was before us—its paths were many and various—it was ours to choose one.</P>
<P>The best one we could adopt at present, was to set off immediately for London, and if we could soften the heart of Mr. Stanford's uncle, to engage his patronage, and thus to ensure a provision for necessa∣ry expenses. We accordingly took our passage in a stage coach, and quickly reached the metropolis of England. As soon as Mr. Stanford could put himself in proper attire, he waited on his uncle, who received him graciously, and enqui∣red very kindly about his friends and the family. As yet Mr. Plunket (who was a maternal uncle) had heard nothing of
<PB N="95" REF="030546_0089_0FE7C4B0E6AC7F58"/>
the step Mr. Stanford had taken, and therefore chearfully promised all the as∣sistance that was in his power, whatever line of business might be fixed on: but the following day, when Mr. Stanford called to settle some way in which to em∣ploy his talents and attention, his uncle's behaviour was totally changed.</P>
<P>He had received a letter from his brother in law, in which mr. Stanford's conduct was highly censured, and a posi∣tive request made not to supply Mr. Stan∣ford with money or any assistance. This was communicated to my best friend, as well as his uncle's resolution to comply with the request. Mr. Stanford could not hear this—his heart filled—he abrupt∣ly left the room—and returned to his lodg∣ings. He had no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> entered the chamber, where I had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing all a∣lone during his absence, than I perceived his heart was heavy, and his spirits de∣jected. He walked the room with a sorrow∣ful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and hurried step, several times—I asked him some questions which he but half answered. On this I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, gave him my hand, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him to con∣fide in me fully and to tell me all his care. He pressed my hand, and seating me on a sofa which was in the room, pla∣ced himself by my side, and resting his head on my neck, unburdened and re∣lieved
<PB N="96" REF="030546_0090_0FE7C4B60E6F4C18"/>
his heart by giving vent to his sor∣row for a few moments. After this, he found himself able to communicate the grounds of his distress. The weight of a father's displeasure he had prepared himself to endure, but to find that dis∣pleasure pursuing him so far as to prevent him from receiving any aid from an uncle, was beyond what he had suspected. I suggested every consolatory argument I could devise, for composing his mind.—I assured him that very little of the world's goods wold content me, while I retained his affection and society—and that instead of spending time in unavailing complaints, we had both best put our shoulders to the wheel, and endeavor to procure subsist∣ence. Accordingly, the next day, mr. Stanford went in quest of cheap and pleas∣ant lodging, and of employment. He was fortunate in providing the first, with an amiable, pious widow lady—who was at once an instructive and agreeable com∣panion; the second he procured with an eminent printer, who was just th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n in want of a man of literature to superin∣tend and correct the press; one who could compose with neatness, and correct with accuracy, and who would attend to his business with punctuality and faithful∣ness.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="030546_0091_0FE7C4B79957C718"/>
For this situation mr. Stanford was well qualified by nature and education—and uniting to talents great assiduity and integrity, he soon gained the confidence and friendship of his employer; to his compensation were often added liberal do∣nations, such as enabled us to support our present stile of life with comfort and ease. Nay, finding our family likely to increase, we contrived ways to lay up a small capi∣tal as a provision for a rainy day—this we knew would be constantly accumulating, and would one day be a help to the sweet little pledge of love, which indulgent heaven presented us, ten months after our union.</P>
<P>On the birth of my lovely boy, new concerns occupied my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd, and new pleasures opened on my heart, that led me to forget the hardships of a separation from the parents that gave me being—Mr. Stanford's attention to me seemed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on this event. He devised pretexts for visiting home, and found ways of accomplishing more of his busi∣ness at our own little retreat—in short, we both now seemed perfectly reconciled to our lot—we pardoned, and began to re∣member no more the severities we had felt. In our devotions, in books, our own conversation, domestic endearments, and the society of a few friends, who occa∣sionally
<PB N="98" REF="030546_0092_0FE7C4BCC24E02F8"/>
visited <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, we possessed as many of the enjoyments of life, as others who moved in a higher circle, and who plum∣ed themselves on their birth and fortune.</P>
<P>And here let me add my testimony, to that of many of the wisest and best of mankind, in favor of a state of mediocri∣ty, when connected with constant em∣ployment, with peace and affection at home. Poverty is less dreadful, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> believe, at hand than at a distance.—While afar, it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seen thro▪ a mist—and bulks largely on the view: when i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ap∣proaches nigh, it often lays aside its ter∣rors, and if it be not the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of sloth or crime, it is often so tempered by the sympathy of the good, and by internal consolations, that it is by no means diffi∣cult of endurance.</P>
<P>In this situation we continued upwards of two years, in which period providence was pleased to give us two charming girls at a birth, in addition to our dear first∣born. To provide for these was our pleasing employ, and to look forward to their future improvement and happy set∣tlement in life, afforded ample room for fancy and hope: but ah! how dark and mysterious are the ways of providence! how sudden and distressing many of the vicissitudes of life! one unlooked for mel∣ancholy event, put a period to this state
<PB N="99" REF="030546_0093_0FE7C4BE4BA36690"/>
of contentment I enjoyed, robbed me of my highest temporal happiness, and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o't me to the very brink of the grave.</P>
<P>It happened one day, that mr. Stan∣ford was called to go a few miles from the city, to receive a sum of money that was due to the person whom he served. He hired a horse in the morning, and promised to be back ear∣ly in the afternoon—he was detained sometime longer than he expected—it was late in the afternoon before he set off—on his return home, as he ap∣proached the city, he was stopped by two ruffians, who demanded his mon∣ey.—He did not choose tamely to sub∣mit to their demands, but with his whip attempted resistance.—The vil∣lains, armed with bludgeons, attack∣ed him with violence—knocked him down—stript him of his money and a great part of his clothes—and left him for dead in the highway. Some benevolent travellers, who happened shortly after to be coming towards London, had him taken up and con∣veyed to the next public house—re∣storatives were applied; and through the influence of medical aid, he was
<PB N="100" REF="030546_0094_0FE7C4C36A202E00"/>
soon possessed of his senses, so far as to relate his name, place of abode, busi∣ness and misfortune—he requested to be conveyed home as soon as possible, and his requect was kindly complied with. He was brought to his home; but oh, my God! in how different circumstan∣ces from those in which he had left me in the morning—from those in which I expected to meet him—I execrated myself for consenting to his leaving me—I murmured at my lot, and in the agony of my soul (I tremble at the remembrance) aspersed the good∣ness, the justice of my maker—I was frantic, I believe, for a considerable time after he was restored to my arms: all the afternoon previous to the misfortune, I had felt an unusual anxiety—but I thought it arose from the timidity of my nature—little did I imagine, that in the place of a heal∣thy and cheerful, I should receive a bleeding husband—All night did I sit by him, attend his wants, and en∣deavor to alleviate his pains—when the surgeon dressed his wounds in the evening, he found his skull was frac∣tured by the blows he had received—
<PB N="101" REF="030546_0095_0FE7C4C4F2BAF810"/>
He recommended a consultation—it was called—and trepanning was ad∣vised and resolved on—I objected, but was obliged to submit; the operation was performed—but is was of little a∣vail—a high fever ensued, and his reason forsook him—He talked inces∣santly of his dear Amelia—of his dar∣ling babes—and the cruelty of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ruffians—Day and night did I watch and weep over him—His incoherencies alarmed—and his many proofs of a strong, though bewildered affection, melted and oppressed my heart—free∣ly would I have surrendered mine to have restored his health—but it was beyond the reach even of medical skill—I was flattered by friends and phy∣sicians with the hope, that his disorder would take a favorable turn—and it did—the fever abated—he became clear and rational, but oh, for how short a space! he called me to the bed∣side, and desired to see his children; they were brought: He looked at them with a peculiar softness; it seem∣ed to be a look of parting tenderness, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the last glances of parental solici∣tude: my agony and my fears encreas∣ed.
<PB N="102" REF="030546_0096_0FE7C4CA1D8B1088"/>
I kneeled down by his bed-side, and taking his hand which began to feel cold, and was covered with a chill perspiration, "my dearest Charles," said I, "what is the matter?"—"Be not alarmed, my love," said he: "but I must leave you very soon"—"O my God, my God!" cried I; it was all I could say—my sight, my senses left me—I swooned away; all that I can recollect of myself afterwards, is, that when I came to my senses I found I had been conveyed to another cham∣ber; that several friends stood around me in tears: with my first returning breath I enquired about my dear Charles, they replied, that they ho∣ped a change had taken place for the better; that I had best try and com∣pose myself. I insisted on being con∣veyed back to my husband; but while we were conversing on the matter, a child came hastily into the room, and cried cut, "Mr. Stanford is dead." These words reached my heart like a shock of lightning, and with the light∣ning's power: had it finished my be∣ing, how grateful should I have been (i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> gratitude be known in the regions
<PB N="103" REF="030546_0097_0FE7C4CC4A776D98"/>
of silence). Again my reason left me, and many days elapsed before it re∣turned. I still possess a faint recollec∣tion of some of the wild rambles of imagination I experienced at this time, how much my heart and mind were fastened to the image of my dear deceased Charles. In this situation I was, as I have since been informed, when Mr. Plunket came to see me; he had attended the funeral of his nephew, and compassionating my con∣dition, directed me to be conveyed with my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bes to his own house. He wrote, to my father giving a state of facts, but will it be credited when I say, that a father's heart had been so alienated by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is present wife, from his suffering child, that he contented himself with writing to Mr. Plunket, and lamenting my situation, but with∣out any offer of assistance, or even coming to see me? The parents of my poor Charles were more compas∣sionate. They could not endure to visit the fathe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'s offence on his inno∣cent offspring: They took my two lit∣tle girls hom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ with them: my boy they left with Mr. Plunket, but in∣sisted,

as soon as my situation would admit, on receiving us in their own house.</P>
<P>My Julia who had supported a con∣stant though forbidden correspond∣ence with her brother and myself, came with her father, and remained some time to attend me. Her affec∣tion and tenderness were of infinite service: by means of it, and a strict observance of my physician's direction, I was in a few weeks, restored again to myself: but from my delirium, to how dreadful a reality did I awake!—deprived of the excellent and be∣loved partner of my soul, on whom all my affection and hopes of happiness had rested, I found myself a solitary widow, with the charge of three poor little orphans on my hands—I looked around for some object of comfort, on which to lean: but all had deserted me. I was in the barren desert, thirs∣ty, yet without water. I was a pil∣grim, cast on a strange coast, with scarcely one sympathetic friend, that could minister to my wants; all hopes and pursuits seemed to have come to a fatal, a final period. I felt as if I
<PB N="105" REF="030546_0099_0FE7C4D4609C4FF8"/>
had nothing worth living for, save my destitute babes, and often notwith∣standing this tie, has my forlorn heart most ardently prayed to the supreme Being to reunite me to the departed object of my love—oh! with what extacy would I have laid down my life, and on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wings of an ardent and sublime affection, have ascended to the only one I ever loved supreme∣ly. But it was the will of heaven, that I should continue here longer, to drink still deeper of the cup of woe, and to feel the weight of accumulated distress—I n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w endured existence for the sake of the dear descendants of my Charles, and had it not been for them, I felt no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e strong enough to bind me to the world.</P>
<P>My situation altogether was, how∣ever, as comfortable now as I had rea∣son to expect. From the attention of Mr. Plunket, I drew great relief, and from the frequent communications I received from my beloved Julia, I felt the sincerest pleasure. In some of her letters she h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld out an idea of paying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a visit—this supported my mind, for some time, and the good girl at
<PB N="106" REF="030546_0100_0FE7C4DA2EBD6C70"/>
length performed her promise. She was attended by a young American gentleman, who had resided a consid∣erable time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n her neighbourhood.—He had paid her great and uninter∣rupted attentions for many months—and common report whispered, that ere long they would be united for life. Deeply interested at I was for the happiness of my friend, I took the earliest opportunity of learning the true ground of the report. Julia, with her usual candour, immediately solved my doubts. She told me Mr. Dalton had indeed been particularly attentive to her for a series of time: that he had avowed his passion—and gained her affection; that she had hes∣itated a whole in consenting to be his, as a necessary consequence of this, would be her removal to America—that this was the only objection with her parents; but they had been pre∣vailed on to give up this point—and consent to a union, even on the terms of her relinquishing her native coun∣try forever.</P>
<P>The bursting sigh, and the rising tear, showed how tenderly this circum∣stance
<PB N="107" REF="030546_0101_0FE7C4DBB78E1B60"/>
affected her; but her heart was Mr. Dalton's—and what difficulties can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oy a purpose, suggested by true female affection? She said she was aware of the distress she should feel in parting forever from those friends, with whom she had hitherto spent her life—and from whose ten∣derness all her past comforts had been drawn—that it was a solemn parting, when relatives were separated without a hope of meeting, till they met be∣yond the grave. However, that she considered this sacrifice due to a man of merit, and to the affections of her heart: that she complied with what she deemed the voice of Providence, and was encouraged to expect happi∣ness, when in the path of virtue: but she intreated, that, while she left all her own family behind. I might not be of the number—she urged me af∣fectionately to blend my fate, and the fate of my little ones with hers—to leave a country, where I had few ties to bind me, and to become an adven∣turer with her beyond the atlantic; that she would be married privately in a very short time; but she insisted
<PB N="108" REF="030546_0102_0FE7C4E21C5CB630"/>
on my being present at the ceremony; and as soon after a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> possible, she ex∣pected to take her passage in a vessel bound to America.</P>
<P>The proposition of leaving my friends and my country, I must own, at first startled me much: and in the apprehension of the moment, I sug∣gested that I did not think I could com∣ply with her benevolent request; but at her solicitation, <HI>I</HI> agreed to consider the matter seriously. But as to being present at her marriage, <HI>I</HI> told her whatever pleasure <HI>I</HI> might once have taken in a circumstance of that kind, at present it would recal too ma∣ny painful scenes of memory, and at once give me distress, and ren∣der me a damp to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> enjoyment of others. A few days after this, when my friend had returned to her father's, <HI>I</HI> pondered seriously on the prospect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he had opened to my view. On the one hand, <HI>I</HI> pictured to myself the pain of parting forever from many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>I</HI> loved, al∣though some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d treated me unkind∣ly—the dangers of the ocean—the uncertainty of my fate when <HI>I</HI> reach∣ed
<PB N="109" REF="030546_0103_0FE7C4E3A67BC6B0"/>
the other side of the ocean—and the forlorn situation, in which <HI>I</HI> should be left, if my Julia were to die. On the other hand. <HI>I</HI> recollected the cru∣elty <HI>I</HI> had experienced from some of my nearest relations; that my own father had abandoned me; that e∣ven were he to receive me beneath his roof—there <HI>I</HI> could take no comfort, with a rough unkind step∣mother; that dependence was there∣fore my lot, and that <HI>I</HI> could endure this state with no one so well as with my sister and friend.</P>
<P>My health was declining—my spir∣its were gone—and <HI>I</HI> was induced to believe, that a voyage across the ocean would restore both. At any rate, <HI>I</HI> thought a change of place could not subtract from my happiness, for that was gone too effectually ever to return, in a place which daily obtruded on my mind recollections of past enjoyments, which death had snatched away and buried with my Charles. On these grounds I concluded, that if urged a∣gain by Julia, and by her future com∣panion, <HI>I</HI> should consent to attend them. A few days after this, my
<PB N="110" REF="030546_0104_0FE7C4EA1CA0CFC8"/>
dear friend's marriage was announced to me by a letter from herself, and one from Mr. Dalton, in which argument and intreaty were used to persuade me into a compliance with their request. <HI>I</HI> did not keep them long in suspence—but signified my acquiescence as ear∣ly as <HI>I</HI> could, in their benevolent plan. Shortly after the adoption of this res∣olution, I communicated it to Mr. Plunket, with whom I still was—and to my father. The first remonstrated against the plan—but in such a way as led me to believe, that the kind∣ness he had hitherto shewn me, was rather from a compassion, that every mind of ordinary sensibility must experience—than from a pe∣culiar affection for myself; and that if I could be decently provided for, without giving the world occasion to reflect on him, as a man of inhumani∣ty, he would feel no great regret in parting with me.</P>
<P>To my father I communicated my purpose, by the following short let∣ter—</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="111" REF="030546_0105_0FE7C4EBACC43868"/>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The affection and gratitude due to my only parent, as the instrument of my being, and the source of much of my happiness in early life, have led me in this way to inform him of my intention to fail in a few days, in company with Mr. and Mrs. Dal∣ton, for America. As I expect nev∣er after my departure to meet my father or sister on earth, it would be a great consolation to me, once more to see them ere we part for life; to ask forgiveness of my past offences a∣gainst their wishes—and to receive their blessing, and their prayers for my happiness. But if this request should be deemed unreasonable, and I should not be gratified with one last interview—you will accept, my father, and will present to my sister, my ar∣dent wishes for your mutual health and peace, and that you may never feel one pang like any of those daily experienced by your afflicted, but af∣fectionate daughter.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>A. S.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>This letter I gave to a special mes∣senger, with an injunction to deliver it to my father himself—and to wait
<PB N="112" REF="030546_0106_0FE7C4F1AB50B6F0"/>
an answer, if any should be offered. On his return which was immediate, he told me, that on hearing from whom he came—and perusing the contents of the letter, my father rais∣ed his eyes and hands to heaven, and breaking forth into a torrent of grief—he said, "he had wronged his poor daughter—his dear Amelia—and while there was yet room for repent∣ance and amendment, he would fly to her, and give her that relief which was yet in his power," I must own I was much affected at this information—I could see the violence of my fa∣ther's returning affection, I thought I could observe the sorrow that would fill his heart at the idea of having for∣ever exiled from her home and her country, a child <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e reared and lov∣ed—and who had never designedly offended him in her life.—My res∣olution <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aultered—but it was stag∣gered more, when presently after, as I sat in my chamber, I was asked if I could bear to see my father and sister. In a tremulous tone, I hastily answered, yes: but I was too weak for the interview—my breath grew
<PB N="113" REF="030546_0107_0FE7C4F3F76AEF78"/>
short—I felt a violent throbbing at my heart: a little time however recover∣ed me in a degree—but when I heard my father's well known voice, below stairs, enquiring, "in which room he should find his daughter Amelia," and when I heard his and my sister's foot ascending the stairs, all my senses left me—and I swooned in the arms of the maid who attended me. The first ob∣jects that struck me when I recovered my faculties, were my father bending over me with a look of piteous ten∣derness—my sister kneeling by my side, bathed in tears, with my little son in her arms, and the domestics around using restoratives for my recovery—I extended my arms to my father and sister alternately, and from each re∣ceived an embrace of the tenderest af∣fection. When we were able to con∣verse, we talked over many events, till finally, we glanced on the one that had produced the present meeting—they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I was not serious in the scheme of leaving Britain for Amer∣ica. I assured them that I was—and that nothing now I believed could alter my determination. They intreated
<PB N="114" REF="030546_0108_0FE7C4FAD7118C50"/>
me not to think of such a thing—they argued—they pleaded with me—they wept:—during three days they stayed with us, the subject was often renew∣ed—my father offered all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e could do for my assistance, and that of my chil∣dren. But I had now made up my mind: I was not to be diverted from my purpose: they had influence e∣nough over me, however, to prevail on me to leave one of my girls to be edu∣cated by my sister, who as yet had none.</P>
<P>Things being thus arranged, I began to prepare industriously for my voyage. Every convenience my father could furnish me with was provided, and the day set for our departure. On the one previous to this, my father and sister come down, and remained with us. We passed it in gloom and sor∣row—after a night of weeping, the morning of embarkation arrived—with streaming eyes and bleeding hearts, we took our last farewell of each oth∣er—we were soon under way—and on the broad tempestuous ocean. No material occurrence happened till we reached America.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="030546_0109_0FE7C4FC69071128"/>
As soon as we had landed and made enquiry into the state of things, Mr. Dalton found that it was not a time to enter largely into trade—the peace between England and America had been concluded for some time, and a vast inundation of goods was pouring into the United States from every quarter; he therefore wisely resolved to retire from business, and fix himself in one of the small towns of Connect∣icut, near which his father lived on a large and productive farm. Accord∣ingly here we removed—and here we now live—we have an intelligent and genteel society in the town—we are punctual in our devotions in the fami∣ly and at church—the manners of the people are congenial with our own—and although we subsist on little, we live very comfortably:—for my own part, I have little to expect from this world—affliction has led me to regard religion as the supreme and only source of happiness in life. In my devotions to God—in the education of my children—and in little charities to my neighbours, I find my chief hap∣piness and employment. I pass a pro∣portion
<PB N="116" REF="030546_0110_0FE7C50218E609E8"/>
of every day in reading, or in writing to absent friends, from whom, in return, I hear frequently.</P>
<P>Thus passes time—thus am I has∣tening to that "undiscovered coun∣try from whose bourne no traveller re∣turns." Soon shall I reach the end of my pilgrimage—soon shall this spirit meet and mingle with the spirit of my dear departed Charles—we shall meet—O rapturous thought! and never be parted more—we shall to∣gether bask in the effulgence of deity—we shall live in the tenderest amity throughout the long, long ages of an endless hereafter.</P>

<HEAD>From Dr. FRANKLIN's WORKS.</HEAD>
<HEAD>On Luxury, Idleness, and Industry.</HEAD>
<HEAD>From a letter to Benjamin Vaughan, <ABBR>Esq.</ABBR> member of the British Parliament written in 1784</HEAD>
<P>IT is wonderful how preposterously the affairs of this world are man∣aged. Naturally one would imagine
<PB N="117" REF="030546_0111_0FE7C503A41CC040"/>
that the interest of a few individuals should give way to the general inter∣est; but individuals manage their af∣fairs with so much more application, industry and address, than the public do theirs, that general interest most commonly gives way to particular.—We assemble parliaments and coun∣cils, to have the benefit of their col∣lected wisdom; but we necessarily have at the same time, the inconvenience of their collected passions, prejudices, and private interests. By the help of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, artful men overpower their wisdom, and dupe its possessors; and if we may judge by the acts, arrets, and edicts, all the world over, for regulating commerce, an assembly of great men is the greatest fool upon earth.</P>
<P>I have not yet, indeed; thought of a remedy for luxury. I am not sure that in a great state it is capable of a remedy: nor that the evil is in itself always so great as it is represented.—Suppose we include in the definition of luxury, all unn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essary expence, and then let us consider whether laws to prevent such expence are possible to
<PB N="118" REF="030546_0112_0FE7A6FE88653B20"/>
be executed in a great country, and whether, if they could be executed, our people generally would be happi∣er, or even richer. Is not the hope of being one day able to purchase and enjoy luxuries, a great spur to labour and industry? May not luxury there∣fore produce more than it consumes, if without such a spur, people would be, as they are naturally enough in∣clined to be, lazy and indolent? to this purpose I remember a circum∣stance. The skipper of a shallop, employed between Cape-May and Philadelphia had done us some small services, for which he refused to be paid. My wife understanding that he had a daughter, sent her a present of a new fashioned cap. Three years after, this skipper being at my house with an old farmer of Cape-May, his passenger, he mentioned the cap, and how much his daughter had been pleased with it. "But (said he) it proved a dear cap to our congrega∣tions,"—"How so?"—"When my daughter appeared with it at meeting, it was so much admired, that all the
<PB N="119" REF="030546_0113_0FE7C50B6ADD5BB0"/>
girls resolved to get such caps from Philadelphia; and my wife and I computed that the whole could not have cost less than a hundred pounds"—"True, (said the farmer) but you do not tell all the story.—I think the cap was neverthe∣less an advantage to us; for it was the first thing that put our girls upon knitting worsted mittens for sale at Philadelphia, that they might have wherewithal to buy caps and ribbons there; and you know that industry has continued, and is likely to contin∣ue and increase to a much greater val∣ue, and answer much better purposes." Upon the whole, I was more reconcil∣ed to this little piece of luxury, since not only the girls were made happier by having fine caps, but the Philadel∣phians by the supply of warm mit∣tens.</P>
<P>In our commercial towns upon the sea-coast, fortunes will occasionally be made. Some of those who grow rich will be prudent, live within bounds, and preserve what they have gained for their posterity: others fond of shewing their wealth, will be extrav∣agant
<PB N="120" REF="030546_0114_0FE7C51123096028"/>
and ruin themselves. Laws cannot prevent this; and perhaps it is not always an evil to the public. A shilling spent Idly by a fool may be picked up by a wiser person, who knows better what to do with it. It it therefore not lost. A vain, silly fel∣low builds a fine house, furnishes it richly, lives in it expensively, and in a few years ruins himself: but the masons, carpenters, smiths, and o∣ther honest tradesmen, have been by his employ assisted in maintaining and raising their families: the farmer has been paid for his labour, and encour∣aged, and the estate is now in better hands. In some cases indeed, certain modes of Luxury may be a public evil, in the manner as it is a private one.—If there be a nation, for instance, that exports its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>f and linen, to pay for the importation of claret and porter, while many of its people live upon po∣tatoes, and wear no shirts; wherein does it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ister from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who lets his family starve, and sells his cloathes to buy drink? Our American commerce is, I confess, a little in this way. We sell our victuals to the islands for ruin
<PB N="121" REF="030546_0115_0FE7C512AEB1E350"/>
and sugar; the substatial necessaries of life for superfluities. But we have plenty, and live well nevertheless, though, by being soberer, we might be richer.</P>
<P>The vast quantity of forest land we have yet to clear, and put in order for cultivation, will for a long time keep the body of our nation laborious and frugal. Forming an opinion of our people and their manners, by what is seen among the inhabitants of the sea ports, is judging from an improper sample. The people of the trading towns may be rich and luxurious, while the country possesses all the vir∣tues that tend to promote happiness and public prosperity. Those towns are not much regarded by the coun∣try; they are hardly considered as an essential part of the states; and the experience of the last war has shewn, that their being in the possession of the enemy, did not necessarily draw on the subjection of the country, which bravely continued to maintain its freedom and independence notwith∣standing.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 paragraph" DISP="〈1 paragraph〉"/></P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="030546_0116_0FE7C517DD599C60"/>
It has been computed by some po∣litical arithmetician, that if every man and woman would work four hours each day on something useful, that labour would produce sufficient to procure all the necessaries and com∣forts in life; want and misery would be banished out of the world, and the rest of the 24 hours might be leisure and pleasure.</P>
<P>What occasions then so much want and misery? It is the employment of numbers in works that produce neither the necessaries or conveniences of life, who with these who do nothing, con∣sume necessaries raised by the labori∣ous. To explain this:</P>
<P>The first elements of wealth are obtained by labour, from the earth and waters. I have land, and raise corn. With this, if I feed a fam∣ily that does nothing my corn will be consumed, and at the end of the year I shall be no richer than I was at the beginning. But if while I feed them, I employ them, some in spinning, others in making bricks, &amp;c. for building, the value of my corn will be arrested and remain with me, and at the end of the year we may be
<PB N="123" REF="030546_0117_0FE7C519FADD4A48"/>
all better cloathed and better lodged. And if, instead of employing a man I feed in making bricks, I employ him in fiddling for me, the corn he eats is gone, and no part of his manufacture remains to augment the wealth and convenience of the family; I shall therefore be the poorer for this fid∣dling man, unless the rest of my fam∣ily work more or eat less, to make up the deficiency he occasions.</P>
<P>Look round the world, and see the millions employed in doing nothing▪ or in something that amounts to no∣thing, when the necessaries and con¦veniences of life are in question.—What is the bulk of commerce, for which we fight and destroy each other, but the toil of millions for superflui∣ties, to the great hazard of many lives, by the constant dangers of the sea? How much labour is spent in building and fitting great ships, to go to China and Arabia for tea and coffee, to the West Indies for sugar, and to America for tobacco? These things cannot be called the necessaries of life, for our ancestors lived very comfortably without them.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="030546_0118_0FE7C5200FD24718"/>
A question may be asked; Could all these people now employed in rai∣sing, making, or carrying superflui∣ties, be subsisted by raising necessa∣ries▪ I think they might. The world is large, and a great part of it still uncultivated. Many hundred mil∣lions of acres in Asia, Africa, and America, are still in a forest; and a great deal even in Europe. On a hundred acres of this forest, a man might become a substantial farmer; and a hundred thousand men employ∣ed in clearing each his hundred acres, would hardly brighten a spot big e∣nough to be visible from the moon, unless with Herschel's telescope; so vast are the regions still in wood.</P>
<P>It is however some comfort to re∣flect, that, upon the whole, the quan∣tity of industry and prudence among mankind, exceeds the quantity of idle∣ness and folly. Hence the increase of good buildings, farms cultivated, and populous cities filled with wealth, all over Europe, which a few years since were only to be found on the coast of the Mediterranean; and this notwith∣standing the mad wars cotin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lly ra∣ging,

by which are often destroyed in one year the works of many years peace. So that we may hope, the luxury of a few merchants on the coast, will not be the ruin of Ameri∣ca.</P>
<P>One reflection more; and I will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd this long rambling letter. Almost all the parts of our bodies require some expence▪ The feet demand shoes; the legs stockings; the rest of the bo∣dy cloathing; and the belly a good deal of victuals.

<HEAD>PROSPERITY AND ADVERSITY</HEAD>
<HEAD>An agllegorical tale</HEAD>
<P>Two of the daughters of Provi∣dence were sent to the house of a rich Phenician merchant, named
<PB N="126" REF="030546_0120_0FE7C5275B2E86D0"/>
Velasco, whose residence was at Tyre, the capital city of the kingdom.</P>
<P>Prosperity, the eldest, was beauti∣ful as the morning, and chearful as the spring; but Adversity was sor∣rowful and ill-favored.</P>
<P>Velasco had two sons, Felix and Uriano. They were both bred to commerce, though liberally educated, and had lived together from their in∣fancy in the strictest harmony and friendship; but love, before whom all affections of the soul are as the traces of a ship upon the ocean, which remain only for a moment, threatened in an evil hour to set them at variance; for both of them were become enam∣oured with the beauties of Prosperity. The nymph, like one of the daugh∣ters of men, gave encouragement to each, by turns: but to avoid a particu∣lar declaration, she vowed a resolution never to marry, unless her sister, from whom she said it was impossible for her to be long separated, was married at the same time.</P>
<P>Velasco was no stranger to the pas∣sions of his sons, and dreading every thing from their violence, to prevent
<PB N="127" REF="030546_0121_0FE7C528E50A2D80"/>
ill consequences, he obliged them by his authority to decide their preten∣sions by lot, each previously engaging in a solemn oath to marry the nymph that should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll to his share. The lots were accordingly drawn, and Prosper∣ity became the wife of Felix, and Ad∣versity of Uranio.</P>
<P>Soon after the celebration of these nuptials, Velasco died, having be∣queathed to his eldest son, Felix, the house wherein he lived, and the great∣est part of his large patrimony and ef∣fects.</P>
<P>The husband of Prosperity was so transported with the gay disposition and enchanting beauties of his bride, that he clothed her in gold and silver, and adorned her with jewels of inesti∣mable value. He built a palace for her in the woods; he made rivers in his gardens, and beautified their banks with temples and pavilions; he enter∣tained at his table the nobles of the land, delighting their cars with mu∣sic, and their eyes with magnificence; but his kindred he beheld as strangers, and the companions of his youth pass∣ed by him unregarded. His brother

<P>But as the stream shows from its channel, and loses itself among the valleys <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> moun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> to also will the current of fortune <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he dissipated, unless bounded by econo∣my. In a few years▪ the estate of Fe∣lix was wasted by extravagance; his merchandize failed him by neglect and his effects were seized by the mer∣ciless hands of creditors. He appl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d himself for support to the nobles and great men whom he had sea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed, and made presents to: but his voice was as the voice of a stranger, and they re∣membered not his face. The friends he had neglected derided him in their turn; his wife also insulted him, and turned her back upon him and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>—yet was his heart <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o bewitched with her sorceries, that he pursued her with entreaties, till by her haste to abandon him, her mask fell off, and discovered to him a face as withered and deformed, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> before it had ap∣peared youthful and engaging.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="030546_0123_0FE7C5303A400490"/>
What become of him afterwards, tradition does not with certainty re∣late. It is believed he fled into E∣gypt, and lived precariously on the scanty benevolence of at few friends who had not totally deserted him; and that he died in a short time, poor, wretched, miserable, and an exile.</P>
<P>Let us now return to Uranio, who, we have already observed, had been driven out of doors by his brother Felix. Adversity, though hateful to his heart, and a spectre to his eyes, was the constant attendant on his steps; and, to aggravate his sorrows, he received certain intelligence that his richest vessel was taken by a Sar∣dinian pirate; that another was lost upon the Lybian straits; and, to com∣plete all, the banker, with whom the greater part of his ready money was entrusted, had deserted his creditors, and retired into Sicily. Collecting, therefore, the small remains of his fortune, he bid adieu to Tyre, and, led by Adversity, he passed through unfrequented roads, and forests over∣grown with bushes.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="030546_0124_0FE7C5364206F390"/>
He came at last to a small village, at the foot of a mountain; here they took up their abode for some time; and Adversity, in return for all the anxiety he had suffered, softening the severity of her looks ministered to him the most faithful counsel, weaning his heart from the immoderate love of earthly things, and teaching him to revere the Almighty, and to place his whole trust and happiness in his gov∣ernment and protection. She human∣ized his soul, made him modest and humble, taught him to compassionate the distresses of his fellow creatures, and instructed him to relieve them.</P>
<P>"I am sent (says she) to those only, who are the favorites of Heaven; for I not only train them up by my severe discipline to future glory, but also prepare them to receive with a greater relish all such moderate enjoyments as are not inconsistent with this proba∣tionary state. As the spider, when assailed, seeks shelter in his inmost web, so the mind, which I assist, con∣tracts its wandering thoughts, and flies for happiness to itself. Prosper∣ity, my smiling, but treacherous sis∣ter,
<PB N="131" REF="030546_0125_0FE7C5387A169B00"/>
too often delivers those whom she has seduced, to be scourged by her cruel followers, Anguish and Des∣pair; while Adversity never fails to lead those who will be guided by her to the blissful habitations of Tranquil∣lity and Content."</P>
<P>Uranio listened to her words with great attention <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and as he looked ear∣nestly on her face, the deformity of it seemed insensibly to decrease. By gentle degrees his aversion to her a∣bated, and at last he gave himself wholly up to her counsel and direction. She would often repeat to him the wise maxims of philosophers, that those who want the fewest things are the happiest. She admonished him to turn his eyes to the many thousands beneath him, instead of gazing on the few who lived in pomp and splendor; and in∣stead of supplicating for riches and popularity, to pray for a virtuous mind, and a quiet state, an unblame∣able life, and a death full of good hopes.</P>
<P>Finding him every day more and more composed and resigned, though neither enamoured with her face, nor
<PB N="132" REF="030546_0126_0FE7C53E2CDEB990"/>
delighted with her society, she<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> addressed him in the following man∣ner:</P>
<P>"As gold is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and refined from the dross by the fire, so is Ad∣versity sent by Providence to try and improve the virtue of mortals. The end obtained, my task is finished and I now leave you, to go and give ac∣count of my charge. Your brother, whose lot was Prosperity, and whose condition you so much envied, after having experienced the error of his choice, is at last released by death from the most wretched of lives. Happy has it been for Uranio that his lot was Adversity; and, if he remem∣bers her as he ought, his life will be honorable, and his death happy."</P>
<P>As she pronounced these words, she vanished out of his sight; but though her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eatures, at that moments instead of inspiring their usual horror, seem∣ed to display a kind of languishing beauty—yet, as Uranio, in spite of his utmost efforts, could never prevail on himself to love her, he neither regret∣ted her departure, nor wished for her return. But, though he rejoiced in
<PB N="133" REF="030546_0127_0FE7C53FC7F96990"/>
her absence, he treasured up her counsels in his heart, and grew hap∣py in the practice of them.</P>
<P>He afterwards be took himself again <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and having, in a short time, acquired a competency sufficient for the real enjoyment of life, he re∣treated to a little farm which he had bought for that purpose, and where he determined to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he remain∣der of his days.

Adjoining to it was a cold bath, formed by a spring issuing from a rose, and over the door, in large characters, was this inscrip∣tion:

<HEAD>THE FAIR PENITENT.</HEAD>
<HEAD>A Fragment.</HEAD>
<P>How unhappy are the fair, who, from mistaken motions of hap∣piness, seek the alluring paths of pleasure! Deluded indeed!—Here a sigh burst from her bosom, at the re∣collection of past folly—a tear fell from its orb, and rested on the cheek of the fair Euphrosyne.</P>
<P>Cease, said she;—The dew drops of contrition, what avail they now? Are not the years of dissipation fleet∣ed away like the sunbeams of the morning, without one reflecting mo∣ment! they sported till my fortune was exhausted—and my friends with fortune fled.</P>

<L>For what is friendship but a name,</L>
<L>A charm that lulls to sleep:</L>
<L>A shade that follows wealth and fame,</L>
<L>And leaves the wretch to weep!"</L>
</LG>
<P>I must now find some solitude, and perhaps close the evening of my life in the lap of penury: But stop, me∣thinks some kind power bids me not despair though I have deviated from prudence, I never have from virtual. Notwithstanding this reverse of for∣tune I may yet be happy; the recti∣tude of my heart shall be my consola∣tion; Here she paused—Yes it must be so. To-morrow, at Aurora's dawn, when the feathered songsters are chanting forth hymns of gratitude to the Supreme Author of the uni∣verse, I will commit myself to his care,—quit this town forever, and en∣deavor to blot out the remembrance of the part I have acted in it.</P>
<P>The ruddy fingers of the morn had just unbarred the gates of light, when Euphrosyne bade adieu to the place of her birth.</P>
<P>The melancholy of the birds, the softness of the air, the universal still∣ness that reigned around, spread a

serenity over her mind, and calmed all her sorrows.—</P>
<P>She stopped to take a survey of the surrounding landscape. How happy exclaimed the fair, are the inhabit∣ants of yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lowly cottage, now en∣joying the sweets of balmy slumbers.

<P>The lofty elm overshadowed her dwelling, and the lowly evergreen crept around her door. Here the once gay Euphrosyne, that lately shone in all the circles of the beau monde, was obscured as in the shadowey vale; but in the vale she was convinced that happiness does not dwell on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> grandeur.</P>

<P>*** Her words, her looks, and the flood of tears which she shed af∣fected me deeply—I dismounted from my horse and tied him to a twig—I sat me down on a bank beside her.</P>
<P>She held a laurel in her hand, and when I asked the cause of her affliction, she pointed to the flower, shook her head, and renewed her tears;—Per∣haps, said I, a stranger may be able to bind up thy wounds. Alas! Sir, replied she, they are beyond human art—He, in whose hand are the issues of life and death, can alone heal the anguish;—He will, I trust, soon bind them up forever:—Has fortune then proved unkind, has friendship grown cold, or has love betrayed thee?</P>
<P>This flower, said she, when the morning sun exhaled the dew from its bosom, might have been regarded as an emblem, of what I was; in its present state, plucked from its branch, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fast away, it is an emblem of what I am—then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, as it were, from her grief, she looked me earnestly in the face, and exclaimed, in a stern tone of voice, it was—

<P>And who is thy father? Ah! me, said she, he indeed lives who was my father, but I am now an orphan; I will not tell the name I have dishonor∣ed.</P>
