<P>WE have no particular account of the <HI>bigness</HI> of this City It was probably of but small extent: Yet was it seated in the midst of a large, fine and fertile country, from whence they supply'd themselves with all manner of provisions. The <HI>spies</HI> sent forth
<PB N="3" REF="003758_0005_1002574888D46BF8"/>
from the <HI>tribe of Dan to search the land,</HI> do therefore unite in that Report about it, v. 9. — <HI>We have seen the land, and behold, it is very good.</HI> V. 10. <HI>When ye go, ye shall come — to a large land: — a place where there is no want of any thing in the earth.</HI> — But I will not detain you too long upon what is less pertinent to the design I have in view. Wherefore,</P>
<P N="2">II. WE may now consider the <HI>character</HI> here given of the <HI>inha∣bitants of</HI> LAISH. <HI>And they came to</HI> LAISH, <HI>unto a people</HI> that were AT QUIET AND SECURE. We have much the same account in v. 7. <HI>They dwelt</HI> CARELESS, — QUIET AND SECURE. That is to say, they did not perplex their minds with concern about their enemies; had no sense of danger; were tho't less of a surprise, and without expectation of any sudden assault. Being at peace with their neighbours, and having been so, perhaps a long time, they had settled into habitual security, dwelt without fear, and knew no uneasiness from an apprehension of being liable to be destroy'd.</P>
<P>AND as the effect of this careless temper, they were shamefully negligent of their own safety; had taken no care to keep up a <HI>martial spirit,</HI> or encourage a knowledge in the <HI>art of war.</HI> Pro∣bably they had no <HI>disciplin'd souldiers</HI>; none us'd to <HI>military exercises</HI>; none acquainted with the management of the <HI>spear,</HI> the <HI>sword</HI> or <HI>bow</HI>; or that had either skill or courage to <HI>speak with the enemy in the gate.</HI> Or if they were ever so <HI>expert</HI> and <HI>valiant,</HI> it was to little purpose, having neither <HI>forts</HI> nor <HI>batteries,</HI> nor any other <HI>strong holds</HI> to defend themselves. Perhaps they had never been at the ex∣pence of erecting <HI>fortifications</HI>; or otherwise, they had carelesly suffer'd them to fall into ruin, and were now in no posture of defence. The passes into their city were all naked and unguarded; they were altogether unprepared for an attack, and every day lia∣ble to be surprised and taken: And yet they were as calm and easy, and as safe from danger in their own apprehensions, as tho' they had been ever so well guarded; and in circumstances to defend themselves against the most powerful enemy.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="003758_0006_1002574A0F780988"/>THIS is the <HI>character</HI> of the <HI>inhabitants of</HI> LAISH: thus careless and secure were they. And two things are mention'd in my con∣text, which might contribute hereto.</P>
<P N="1">I. THEY had their <HI>dependance</HI> on ZIDON for protection and se∣curity. Several hints are given from whence we may collect this. In the latter part of my <HI>text,</HI> 'tis said, <HI>There was no deliverer because it was far from</HI> ZIDON. And in the 7. v. 'tis recorded of the <HI>spies,</HI> that <HI>they found it was far from the</HI> ZIDONIANS. It looks as tho' the ZIDONIANS were the great protectors of the LAISHITES; their chief strength and security. Perhaps they were a COLONY planted from ZIDON, still under their care and jurisdiction. They are said v. 7. to have <HI>dwelt after the manner</HI> of the ZIDONIANS. i. e. They imitated their customs, and conformed to their way of liv∣ing; one very natural account whereof is, their having originally sprang from them. To be sure, the ZIDONIANS were at amity with them, firmly attacht to their Interest, and in readiness to en∣gage on their behalf against all opposers.</P>
<P>Now the ZIDONIANS were a large and powerful people; well able to defend themselves, and upon <HI>timely notice</HI> to protect the city of LAISH. And upon this account, they might be off their guard, and in their own opinion free from danger. However weak and defenceless in themselves, they were yet easy; depend∣ing upon the strength of ZIDON; not considering their <HI>distance</HI> from that place; and that they might be surprised and destroyed, before they could call in their assistance. Perhaps they flattered themselves, their enemies would not dare attempt an expedition against them, while they knew they were the <HI>friends,</HI> and it may be the <HI>Government</HI> of a people so powerful as were the ZIDONIANS.</P>
<P N="2">2. THEY <HI>had no Magistrate in the land to put them to shame in any thing,</HI> as we read in v. 7. There is no need of understanding these words in the most rigid sense, as if there were none a∣mong the LAISHITES cloath'd with <HI>civil Authority</HI>; But only that there was wanting a due care in <HI>Magistrates</HI> to execute the trust
<PB N="5" REF="003758_0007_1002574BCEF12E18"/>
repos'd in them: One flagrant instance whereof, was, their being themselves easie, and suffering the People to be so too, while their Country lay in a wretched defenceless state; expos'd to every invader, and liable to be taken from them. It belong'd to those who were the <HI>heads</HI> of the People, to provide for their safety and security. They should have been sensibly touch'd with concern to behold their weak and shiftless condition, and taken effectual care, by <HI>warlike</HI> preparations, to place them in a posture of defence. They should have <HI>put the People to shame</HI> in consideration of their faulty ease and security, while naked and unfortify'd; and encouraged their coming into measures to strengthen their borders against the attempts of their enemies And their not being so tho'tful of this as was proper and becom∣ing, was no doubt one great reason of their living in such un∣guarded circumstances.</P>
<P>I shall only add, this carelessness of the <HI>People</HI> of LAISH, was a Character very disgraceful. 'Tis recorded in my Text to their dishonour; as an argument of their want of policy, and a due regard to their own safety. And 'tis really a reproach to any People, considering the lusts of Men, and the wars and fightings every where arising in the world here from, to neglect securing themselves against invaders. It was owing to this that LAISH was destroy'd. If they had been strengthen'd with walls and bulwarks; if they had encouraged among them a number of <HI>men of valour, ex∣pert in war, that knew how to keep rank</HI> and withstand an enemy, the DANITES would have been discouraged from any attempts against them. 'Twas the careless, secure posture they were in, that invited them to enter their land; and it must be ascribed chiefly to this, that they so easily <HI>smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt their city with fire</HI>: Which leads me,</P>
<P N="3">III. To consider the <HI>conquest and overthrow of</HI> LAISH. <HI>And they came to</HI> LAISH, — <HI>and smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire.</HI> Two things are here worthy of notice. (1.) The <HI>persons</HI> making this conquest. (2.) The <HI>conquest</HI> it self.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="6" REF="003758_0008_1002574F618C3DD8"/>1. THE <HI>persons</HI> making this conquest. And these were the DANITES: Not the whole tribe, who, so long ago as when they enter'd <HI>Canaan,</HI> were above sixty thousand men <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Numb.</HI> 26.43.</NOTE>; but only a small <HI>regiment</HI> chosen out of the rest upon this occasion. They had be∣fore (as became the subtilty of DAN, who was as a <HI>serpent by the way</HI>) sent out <HI>spies to search the land,</HI> and inquire into the <HI>posture of its inhabitants</HI>: And from the account they brought of their strange security and unguarded condition, they concluded six hundred men, <HI>expert</HI> and <HI>valiant,</HI> and well fitted with <HI>weapons of war,</HI> would be sufficient to make an easy prey of them. A small force it shou'd seem to enter into an enemies country! and this upon a design of making themselves masters of it: But knowing their circumstances before hand, that they should find them careless and at ease, and in no posture of defence; they wisely thought a handful of men would be able to surprize and take them.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>conquest</HI> it self. And this was great and surprizing. 'Tis said, <HI>they smote them with the edge of the sword,</HI> i. e. the <HI>inhabitants of</HI> LAISH. And this they did, it should seem, without limitation or distinction. Their eye did not pity, nor their hand spare; but they greedily fell upon them, and made a most awful and universal slaughter. As <HI>Israel</HI> was commanded to do to <HI>Amalek,</HI> they <HI>slew both man and woman, the infant and the suckling.</HI> Having drawn the sword, they did not return it back, till they had destroy'd both male and female, the high as well as the low; <HI>the young man and the virgin; the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> also, and the man of gray hairs.</HI> A most asto∣nishing destruction! — O the distress of the poor frighten'd and amaz'd people! — How bitter were their shreiks and cries! — how doleful their dying groans and agonies! — But what still heightens the horror, <HI>the city</HI> was set into flames, and consumed to ashes. For so it follows, <HI>and burnt the city with fire.</HI></P>
<P>IT may look as tho' the DANITES were herein wanting to them∣selves and their own interest. But possibly they did this in the heat of battle, when men's tho'ts an't about them, and they are
<PB N="7" REF="003758_0009_10025751D5D73B78"/>
wont to neglect their own future advantage: or which is more pro∣bable, they might <HI>set the city on fire,</HI> the more to surprize the people, to strike them with the greater terror, that they might obtain a more easy conquest over them.</P>
<P>AND in this action of theirs against LAISH, we have a remarka∣ble accomplishment of an ancient <HI>prophecy</HI> concerning <HI>Dan.</HI> We read, Deut. xxxiii. 22. <HI>And of Dan, he said, Dan is a lions whelp.</HI> And in this expedition he prov'd himself to be so. i.e. He resembled a fierce and couragious <HI>young lion.</HI> It follows, <HI>He shall leap from Bashan. Dan</HI> had no inheritance near <HI>Bashan.</HI> The comparison therefore lies in his being like a <HI>lion leaping on Bashan.</HI> "'Tis one property of the <HI>lion</HI> to leap upon his prey, and fasten his nails and teeth into it: And so did the DANITES suddenly leap, as it were from one end of <HI>Canaan</HI> to the other, and seize upon the city of LAISH". And no doubt, this is the thing, the <HI>spirit of GOD</HI> had in view in this <HI>prophetic</HI> description. And it's a good illustration of the jewish story, that this event, so many hundred years, before its accomplishment, should be made one of the main strokes in <HI>Dan</HI>'s character.</P>
<P>BUT here arises a question of some importance, and that is</P>
<P><HI>HOW could the</HI> DANITES, <HI>without great wickedness, barbarity and injustice, thus come upon the</HI> LAISHITES, <HI>and totally destroy them</HI>?</P>
<P>IF we consult our <HI>context,</HI> we shall find, the great reason of their undertaking this expedition was, that they might have a more com∣modious Settlement. That which they possest already was too scanty; they were by the <HI>Amorites</HI> pent up into a narrow compass: and 'twas this that obliged them to seek out for better quarters elsewhere, at least for part of their tribe; and that led them to go up against LAISH, having received a favourable report of their land. But where is the justice of warring against this people, and taking away their lives, that they might seize upon their proper∣ties, and inherit their land? What right does the want of a good settlement in one people, give them to invade the possessions and
<PB N="8" REF="003758_0010_100257548C596850"/>
destroy the lives of another, who are favour'd in this respect? Sure∣ly it can convey none at all: and if it was all that could be said in defence of this action of the DANITES, that they <HI>wanted an inheritance,</HI> it would deserve no better a name than wicked vio∣lence; the most barefac'd robbery and murder.</P>
<P>LET it therefore be observed,</P>
<P>THE <HI>whole land of Canaan</HI> (within the bounds of which lay the city of LAISH, with all its territories,) was firmly convey'd by <HI>deed of gift</HI> from the GREAT SOVEREIGN of the World, to ABRA∣HAM, and his POSTERITY, to be their possession forever. To this purpose we read, Gen. xii. 6, 7. <HI>And</HI> ABRAM <HI>passed thro' the land —. And the</HI> CANAANITE <HI>was then in the land. And the</HI> LORD <HI>appeared unto</HI> ABRAM, <HI>and said,</HI> UNTO THY SEED WILL I GIVE THIS LAND. The same promise is very particularly repeat∣ed, Chap. xiii v. 14, 15. <HI>And the</HI> LORD <HI>said to</HI> ABRAM, — <HI>lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art, northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward. For all the land which thou seest,</HI> TO THEE WILL I GIVE IT, AND TO THY SEED FOR EVER. And in the xv. chap. 18. v. we have recorded a most ex∣plicit and formal grant of this land. <HI>In that same day the</HI> LORD <HI>made a covenant with</HI> ABRAM, <HI>saying,</HI> UNTO THY SEED HAVE I GIVEN THIS LAND, <HI>from the river of Egypt, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.</HI> And when THE SEED OF ABRAHAM were multi∣plied into a great people, we find the blessed <HI>GOD</HI> thus bespeaking them, Exod. vi. 8. <HI>And I will bring you into the land, concerning the which I did swear to</HI> GIVE IT, <HI>to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and</HI> I WILL GIVE IT YOU FOR AN HERITAGE. From these texts it appears plain, that the <HI>land of Canaan</HI> was given of <HI>GOD</HI> to the <HI>people of Israel</HI>; and that the <HI>grant</HI> was several times repeated in the most ample and solemn manner.</P>
<P>Now the infinite GOD having the first and most absolute and in∣disputable title to this whole earth, a grant of any part of it from him must convey the best and surest claim; a title paramount to all others, and that will remain good against every other claim,
<PB N="9" REF="003758_0011_100257561223B8F8"/>
how long so ever any persons of any nation or character may have been in possession of the land thus convey'd. For all nations as well as particular persons, originally hold what they pos∣sess, under <HI>GOD</HI> as maker and Lord-proprietor of the world: and therefore they are at best but <HI>tenants at evill</HI>; and he may at his pleasure make over a right to other persons: nor may any dare say to him, what doest thou?</P>
<P>FROM these premises, it may be affirm'd, tho' the city of LAISH and the land bordering thereon, were possest by those who had long been inhabitants of <HI>Canaan</HI>; yet that they were not the <HI>true owners</HI> of what they had in possession. The city they liv'd in, and the lands they had under improvement, were the <HI>property</HI> of the <HI>feed of Abraham,</HI> freely granted and confirmed to them from the <HI>great Lord</HI> of the whole earth: and they had a right to enter upon possession of what had been thus given them, whenever they saw fit. And as the DANITES, who were the <HI>posterity of Abraham,</HI> and <HI>one</HI> of the <HI>tribes of Israel,</HI> were now in want of a good settlement, there was no obstacle in the way of their coming to LAISH, if they were able to conquer and turn them out of their land. And tho' in the doing of this, they might be instrumental of taking a∣way their lives, yet might they warrantably do it: for the <HI>people of Israel,</HI> of whom the DANITES were a part, not only had a title to the <HI>land of Canaan</HI> made over to them, but were commanded and encouraged by the great <HI>GOD,</HI> to go and take possession of the land, as we may see at large, in the first chap. of <HI>Joshua.</HI> And over and above this, they were impower'd to destroy the <HI>old inhabitants of the land,</HI> as is plain from a great number of texts, which we are all acquainted with, in the series of the <HI>mosaick</HI> history. And it looks as if the <HI>supreme majesty</HI> had manifested it to be his mind, that <HI>his people Israel</HI> should be the <HI>executioners</HI> of his wrath upon the <HI>simul inhabitants of Canaan, the measure of whose iniquity was now full.</HI></P>
<P>THE case before us is therefore an extraordinary one. What the DANITES did, would in any other people, have been utterly unlawful; a great piece of injustice and iniquity: but a warrantable
<PB N="10" REF="003758_0012_10025757ACBBE398"/>
action in them, because the <HI>sovereign GOD</HI> had vacated the right the <HI>inhabitants of Canaan</HI> had to their possessions, and convey'd it away from them to the <HI>Israelites</HI>: and over and above this had constitu∣ted <HI>this people</HI> his <HI>Deputies,</HI> to punish their iniquities, which had ri∣pen'd them for destruction.</P>
<P>NATIONS and cities should learn herefrom the dreadful evil and danger of sin; and be afraid to go on commiting it, hardening themselves against <HI>GOD,</HI> least he should be provoked in his holy and righteous providence, to bring them to ruin.</P>
<P>THEY should also take heed of encouraging themselves, from this action of the DANITES, which was out of the common course of things to take up arms against others. If necessitated hereto in order to redress Injuries, or defend themselves when unrighteously invaded, or for any other wise and good cause, they may do well to make use of force: 'tis consonant to the reason of things, and perfectly con∣sistent with the laws of our holy religion▪ Tho' 'tis contrary to both, for nations to act in conformity to the <HI>pattern</HI> of these DANITES, i. e. to make war with a people and take away their properties and lives, without provocation, or having been abus'd by them: unless with the <HI>men of Israel</HI> they could produce a <HI>warrant from heaven,</HI> to justify their <HI>warlike</HI> proceedings. But I must not enlarge here, 'tis time we proceed now,</P>
<P N="4">IV. To consider, <HI>their having no deliverer, because they were far from</HI> ZIDON. Several times in this <HI>chapter</HI> particular notice is taken of the <HI>distance</HI> of ZIDON from LAISH. The spies from the <HI>tribe of Dan,</HI> presently got acquainted with this, and set a special mark up∣on it, v. 7. And no doubt upon their return, this was one encou∣raging article in their report to their brethren. And now that they had gone to LAISH, and taken and destroy<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d it, an emphasis is laid upon this; <HI>there was no deliverer, because they were far from</HI> ZIDON.</P>
<P>THE least that can be gathered from hence is, whatever was the condition of LAISH, yet that the DANITES were aware of the
<PB N="11" REF="003758_0013_1002575A27034630"/>
strength of ZIDON: and at the same time well appris'd of their being in league with LAISH, and in readiness (at least if apply'd to herefor) to send a sufficient force to guard and protect them. Their greatest concern therefore seems to have been, to carry on their design against LAISH <HI>so secretly,</HI> as that it might not be known, nor if possible so much as suspected. And this they were under ad∣vantage to do, by reason of the distance between LAISH and ZIDON. These two cities were not very remote from each other; yet wer<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they so far asunder, that with due care and caution, the <HI>men of Dan</HI> might come against LAISH, without the knowledge of ZIDON. And it was owing to their policy in thus coming against them, that they were not disappointed in their attempt. If they had pro∣claimed their design; advanced towards the city by slow and lei∣surely steps, giving warning of their approach; the <HI>men of</HI> LAISH would doubtless have had help from ZIDON. But falling upon them suddenly, without the suspicion of the ZIDONIANS, and while the LAISHITES themselves were tho'tless of danger, they at once destroy'd them: and this, without any <HI>deliverer.</HI> Says my text, <HI>there was no deliverer, because they were far from</HI> ZIDON.</P>
<P>AND herein appears, in the strongest light, the folly of the peo∣ple of LAISH, in suffering their city to lie so shamefully <HI>expos'd</HI> to enemies. Notwithstanding the strength of ZIDON, and their dependance on them for protection and defence, we see they were totally destroy'd. And there is <HI>no place</HI> weak and defenceless in it self, but is equally liable to be surpris'd and taken, let the <HI>power</HI> that is their chief guard and safety be ever so <HI>formidable,</HI> if it be <HI>at a distance.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE APPLICATION now remains.</HEAD>
<P>AND the <HI>use</HI> I would make of my <HI>text</HI> shall be, to <HI>recommend a due concern and care that our</HI> TOWN <HI>and</HI> LAND <HI>may be both put and kept in a sutable posture of defence.</HI></P>
<P>IF it may not be said of us at present, as of the <HI>men of</HI> LAISH, that we are <HI>a people at quiet and secure,</HI> 'tis because we have but very

lately awoke out of that deep security, which seem'd universally to reign in all parts of the country. To what else can it be as∣crib'd, that so little of a <HI>martial spirit</HI> has been visible among us in the days that are not far past? so strange a neglect to become acquainted with <HI>warlike exercises</HI>? so shameful a disregard to the appointed days of <HI>muster,</HI> by <HI>officers</HI> as well as <HI>souldiers</HI>? To what else can it be attributed, that our <HI>frontiers</HI> have been settled in so scatter'd a manner? and that the people inhabiting them are so generally at ease, while they lie naked and unguarded, and in case of an unexpected assault, in no condition to defend them∣selves? And what other account can be given of that miserable poor state, in which the <HI>chief bulwark</HI> to the whole Province has been reduced? and that the <HI>Forts</HI> and <HI>Batteries</HI> in <HI>this</HI> and our other <HI>Sea-port</HI> Towns, have been suffered gradually to decay, till at length they have fallen to the ground?</P>
<P>THESE are certainly instances of a temper and conduct, as far from reflecting honour upon us, as they proclaim a sad neglect of our own safety. If a number of <HI>Spies</HI> had been sent from those who wish us no good, <HI>to search our land,</HI> and inquire into the posture of its inhabitants, they must with the <HI>Men from the tribe of Dan</HI> when they came to LAISH, have <HI>seen the people of the land, how they dwelt careless, quiet and secure</HI>: And the report they would have made upon their return, must have been like that which the <HI>Spies</HI> in my <HI>context</HI> made to their brethren, <HI>Arise that we way go up against them, for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good. When ye go, ye shall come</HI> TO A PEOPLE SECURE, <HI>and to a large land.</HI> And if from such a report, unhappily spread abroad about our land, our enemies should, without noise, engage in a design against us, and so carry it on, as on a sudden to surprize this <HI>first City</HI> of our Province, what might we expect, but to be <HI>smote with the edge of the sword,</HI> or to have <HI>our city burnt with fire,</HI> or to be laid under some <HI>heavy Contribution</HI>? Nor could we, in such a case, expect any relief; being <HI>so far from</HI> ZIDON the chief place of our hope and defence</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="003758_0015_1002575E36946980"/>'Tis upon this account we behold with pleasure the <HI>reviving</HI> of a <HI>martial spirit</HI> in our land; the care that has lately appear'd in many of our <HI>officers,</HI> to acquaint themselves with <HI>military exercises</HI>; to acquire a <HI>laudable skill</HI> in the management of <HI>warlike weapons,</HI> and to gain the character of <HI>well accomplish'd souldiers.</HI> Nor does it af∣ford us less satisfaction to see a concern and endeavour among our <HI>magistrates</HI> as well as <HI>people,</HI> to repair our decay'd <HI>castle</HI> and <HI>batteries,</HI> and put them into a condition of being a security to us.</P>
<P>THESE look like <HI>good omens,</HI> and yield a hopeful prospect, now that there are such commotions among the <HI>powers of Europe,</HI> and danger lest our KING and NATION should engage in a <HI>war,</HI> that would make those our enemies, who look with an envious eye up∣on us, and may have it in their hearts to make an expedition against us.</P>
<P>IN a day of such doubtful expectation it will not be tho't un∣seasonable, earnestly to recommend a care, to exert our selves for our own safety and security.</P>
<P>OUR CAPTAIN GENERAL will not therefore take it amiss, if we humbly express our wishes, that such may be honor'd with commissions <HI>in the militia</HI> from time to time, as are of a known charac∣ter for their loyalty to their <HI>king</HI> and love to their <HI>country</HI>; for their courage and activity; for their <HI>martial</HI> genius and accomplishments; for their strict regard to temperance, discipline and good order. And while we behold such at the head of our <HI>regiments</HI> or <HI>companies,</HI> we thankfully acknowledge the wise care of our CHIEF COMMAND∣ER, in conferring honor upon well chosen persons: as hereby we are encouraged to hope, that <HI>military</HI> skill and valour, together with sobriety and a due decorum, will be promoted among our souldi∣ers: than which nothing will more tend to make our <HI>militia</HI> our glory, as well as strong defence.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="003758_0016_10025761A1FF23E8"/>SUCH as wear <HI>commissions</HI> under our CAPTAIN GENERAL, our <HI>Colonels, Majors, Captains,</HI> and <HI>other officers,</HI> are next to be apply'd to. And as there is just reason to expect you should be <HI>men of valour, expert in war,</HI> and well skill'd in all the <HI>exercises</HI> of the <HI>military art</HI>; we doubt not you will be ambitious in these regards, to approve your selves well accomplish'd <HI>commanders.</HI> We trust, you are sen∣sible, a due care to excel in <HI>military</HI> knowledge, and to make your selves <HI>masters</HI> of the <HI>art of war,</HI> will reflect greater glory upon you, and more tend to support the dignity and authority of your <HI>posts,</HI> than meer honorary titles. And being your selves thorough∣ly acquainted with the <HI>martial art,</HI> we shall depend upon your care and fidelity to diffuse this useful knowledge thro' our whole <HI>militia.</HI> And as with great strictness you have endeavour'd to know the state of your several <HI>wards,</HI> how they have been provided with <HI>arms</HI> and <HI>ammunition,</HI> we flatter our selves you will take a like care to instruct our souldiers in the use of their <HI>arms</HI>; how to <HI>keep rank,</HI> and with art and ease to put &amp; keep themselves in the best posture as well to <HI>offend</HI> an enemy, as to <HI>defend</HI> themselves. In order whereto, you will not fail to call them together, as you are impow∣er'd: nor upon the appointed seasons of <HI>training,</HI> will you pass a∣way the time in <HI>meer appearance</HI>; but employ <HI>your souldiers</HI> in such <HI>warlike exercises,</HI> as may happily tend to increase that <HI>skill</HI> and <HI>valour,</HI> which may fit them for <HI>service,</HI> whenever in the providence of God, you shall be call'd to fight for the lives and <HI>properties,</HI> and <HI>cities</HI> of <HI>your country.</HI></P>
<P>AND it were to be wisht, our <HI>souldiers</HI> would more generally at∣tend their duty upon the known seasons of <HI>muster.</HI> There is not indeed so great a neglect in this regard, as in the days that are not far past; nor is the appearance of our <HI>militia</HI> so shamefully <HI>thin</HI> and <HI>shatter'd</HI>: yet it is not so <HI>large</HI> and <HI>honorable,</HI> as it might and ought to be. And would it not have a happy tendency to increase the number, and inhance the beauty and glory of our <HI>companies,</HI> if persons of <HI>circumstances</HI> and <HI>character</HI> would give their attendance? Nor need they be asham'd to be seen in <HI>arms</HI> upon our days of <HI>train∣ing</HI> It would soon become reputable, and be esteem'd an honour,
<PB N="15" REF="003758_0017_10025764130BEA60"/>
if <HI>masters</HI> as well as <HI>servants,</HI> if <HI>gentlemen</HI> as well as those in <HI>lower life,</HI> would for a while more generally appear in the <HI>habit of souldi∣ers,</HI> upon <HI>military</HI> days. And if nothing else will oblige hereto, 'tis pity but the <HI>fines on delinquents</HI> should be increased. They are found, as stated at present, to be insufficient to answer the good end aim at. And we cannot but hope, as there is a wholsome law requiring an <HI>appearance in arms</HI> on days for <HI>training,</HI> care will be taken to guard it with a still heavier penalty: this being a thing so reasonable in it self, and so necessary to support the honor of a <HI>law,</HI> without a regard to which, our country must un∣avoidably be in a very unsafe condition.</P>
<P>AND as we seem united in a concern for the security of the <HI>pro∣vince</HI> in this juncture of affairs, it may be humbly offered, whe∣ther it would not tend to our honor as well as the safety of our <HI>trade,</HI> which is now become so considerable, if measures were con∣certed in order to our having some guard upon our <HI>coasis.</HI> In case of a rupture, we are not likely to suffer more in any thing than by rapine and violence on the <HI>sea.</HI> A certain <HI>harbour</HI> most strongly fortified, not many hundred miles from this place, lying in the way of all our vessels as they go and come upon foreign voyages, will doubtless be the resort of a number of <HI>privateers,</HI> from whence they may run out, and make fearful depredations on us A mat∣ter not unworthy of our serious consideration: nor is our interest more deeply concerned in any one thing. And it looks as tho' we should very much neglect our own security, if for want of some <HI>naval guard,</HI> we should suffer it to be in the power of every little <HI>Pickeroon</HI> to make a prey of our vessels.</P>
<P>IT may now be expected I should address the HONOURABLE COMPANY, at whose desire I stand in this place.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>WE greatly rejoyce to see you growing in reputation, by the handsome additions, that have, within these few years, been made to you: and heartily wish you may go on increasing in
<PB N="16" REF="003758_0018_1002576599F0DE80"/>
number and glory; and that from your body, as from a <HI>seminary</HI> for <HI>martial</HI> accomplishments, our land may be furnish'd with men <HI>expert in war</HI>; fit to stand at the head of our armies, and lead and command in a day of battle.</P>
<P>How soon such a day may come upon us <HI>GOD</HI> only knows. It looks as if it would not be long, before those will be our ene∣mies, who may give us occasion to see, who <HI>have prov'd their ar∣mour</HI>; who in the <HI>military order</HI> have <HI>skill</HI> and <HI>courage</HI>; are best able and will be most <HI>active</HI> and <HI>resolute</HI> in defending their country.</P>
<P>AND will it not be a disgrace to this <HI>ancient company of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> if from among <HI>them</HI> there should not appear a number of men, <HI>each like the son of a king,</HI> for <HI>martial</HI> skill and valour?</P>
<P>YOU are by <HI>profession</HI> souldiers; and by <HI>charter,</HI> as it were a <HI>school</HI> to teach and propagate the <HI>military art</HI>: wherever therefore in our land, there may be wanting a <HI>warlike spirit</HI> and <HI>dexterity,</HI> we may justly expect to find it here. Nor will any thing more tend to heigthen the glory of your <HI>company,</HI> than the display of a singular and extraordinary <HI>expertness</HI> in all instances of <HI>martial</HI> valour and knowledge.</P>
<P>IN order whereto,</P>
<P>YOU will no doubt judge it needful to take care, who you admit into your number: being always cautious of those who may have a greater regard to <HI>artillery treats</HI> and a few <HI>legal ex∣emptions,</HI> than to accomplish themselves to serve their <HI>king</HI> and <HI>country.</HI></P>
<P>YOU will also be so wise as to make choice from time to time, <HI>of well qualified officers</HI>; men of a <HI>martial genius</HI>; of known <HI>skill</HI> and <HI>courage</HI>; able both to instruct and command, and that may appear <HI>a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> at your head.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="003758_0019_100257674DCB3060"/>NOR will you upon your stated <HI>trainings,</HI> think it enough to be seen in arms only to make a goodly show: but you will careful∣ly attend the <HI>exercises</HI> proper to such days, not meerly for <HI>diversion,</HI> but with a view to accomplish your selves with yet superior de∣degrees of skill in the <HI>military art</HI>; and this, that you may be prepared to serve <HI>GOD</HI> in serving your <HI>country,</HI> whenever in provi∣dence you shall be call'd hereto.</P>
<P>WITH such aims we would hope, you have now put on your armour: and we accordingly wish you a <HI>blessing out of the house of the Lord</HI>; commending your <HI>persons</HI> and the <HI>affairs of this day</HI> to the direction and care of <HI>heaven</HI>; beseeching the almighty to make you <HI>strong and couragious</HI>; to furnish you with <HI>martial</HI> skill and good conduct; and so every way accomplish you, as that you may be the <HI>beauty of our Israel,</HI> our safety and defence.</P>
<P>AND let nothing be ever seen among you, that shall stain your glory. Always beware of sin; and arm your selves against all temptations to it. And as becomes christian souldiers, <HI>be temperate in all things.</HI> And if it should be found, that the <HI>entertainments</HI> which ordinarily conclude your <HI>days of training,</HI> endanger a breach of the <HI>great law</HI> of sobriety, you will doubtless do well to take the matter into your serious consideration: And since they plainly run into an expence, that is no ways balanc'd by the service they do towards promoting true <HI>military</HI> skill and valour, where would be the inconvenience, if they were laid aside? at least, if they were less frequent, or better guarded with strict cautionary rules and penalties?</P>
<P>IN fine, forget not your <HI>spiritual warfare.</HI> Often think, how many the enemies are that war against your souls; how power∣ful their strength; how deep their policy; how indefatigable their pains, that they may pain you forever: And O beware of their devices! Always be upon your guard; — and fight couragiously for your precious and immortal souls.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="003758_0020_1002576B78C18698"/>AND let this be the care of <HI>us all.</HI> We have every one of us, young and old, men and women, many spiritual enemies to withstand, and finally conquer; or we are undone forever▪ And O let us take heed of carelessness and security: Let us realise our danger, be continually upon the watch, and <HI>resist stedfast in the faith</HI> all that seek to destroy us.</P>
<P>AND tho' we must look to <HI>fight against</HI> not only <HI>flesh and blood,</HI> but <HI>principalities and powers, and the rulers of the darkness of this world, and spiritual wickednesses in high places</HI>; yet let us not be disheartened. JESUS the <HI>almighty Saviour,</HI> is our <HI>chief leader and commander</HI>: And as he has <HI>spoil'd principalities and powers, and made a shew of them openly,</HI> we may reasonably hope, while we fight manfully under him, to <HI>come off conquerors and more than conquerors.</HI></P>
<P>ONLY as he has directed, Let us <HI>take to ourselves the whole armour of God.</HI>—Let us get acquainted with the use of those <HI>weapons that are not carnal, but spiritual; and mighty thro' God, for pulling down of strong holds.</HI>—Let us take heed of <HI>entangling our selves with the affairs of this life, that we may please him who has chosen us to be souldiers.</HI> And <HI>as good souldiers of Jesus Christ, let us endure hardness.</HI> Let us be <HI>sober, vigilant, circumspect.</HI> — And let us <HI>do all</HI> that we can <HI>to stand; praying always with all prayer and supplications in the spirit.</HI></P>
<P>AND in the exercise of these <HI>military virtues,</HI> let us faithfully employ our selves even to the death. Never let us <HI>desert our post,</HI> or <HI>fly from our colours</HI>; neither let us fight as those that <HI>beat the air,</HI> but with true life and vigour, as those that are in earnest, and fight for their souls and a never ending eternity. And if by surprize, or thro' the subtilty of our adversaries, we shou'd get a foil in one <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; let us take heart, and reinforce the battel: or if we shou'd gain the field; let us not lie by careless and secure, but be ready for a new onset. And thus let us go on <HI>fighting the good fightt of faith,</HI> till we have <HI>overcome thro' the blood of the Lamb</HI> and then
<PB N="19" REF="003758_0021_1002576DEB3A2598"/>
will our <HI>glorious Head and Leader,</HI> confer upon us a <HI>crown of life.</HI> For these are the words on which he has encouraged us to hope, Rev. 3.21. <HI>To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame, and am sit down with my father in his throne,</HI> Amen.</P>
