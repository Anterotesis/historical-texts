<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HAT the Office and Work of the Gospel-Mi∣nistry is founded on Divine Institution, may easily appear to those, who read the Scriptures with serious unbyas'd thought and observation. Its a work, the right performance whereof is attended with many and great difficulties; partly from the various, frequent, furious Assaults of Satan; partly from the Lusts of Men, variously discouraging or op∣posing of it; and partly from the weaknesses and re∣maining corruptions, even of the best of those, who engage in it. Yet 'tis a Work very honourable in it self, and of vast Weight and Importance. It must needs be thought so, if we rightly consider, that 'tis the Infinitely Great, Glorious, Holy, Heart-searching God, who (in His Providence) Calls and Commissions Men to this Work; that the main Scope of the Work is, to batter down Satans Kingdom, to pull down the strong holds of Lust in the Hearts of Men, to promote the Glory of Divine Grace thro' Christ, in saving

Mens Precious Immortal Souls, one of which is more worth than a World; and that those who engage in this Work, must give up a strict account of their Management, to that God who employs them, who can't be deceived and won't be mocked, and who will require at their hands the Blood of those Souls that pe∣rish thro' their neglect, as well as graciously and abun∣dantly reward them if they are Faithful. These brief hints show, that the Work of the Gospel-Ministry is exceeding great, weighty and important. If the sense hereof made <HI>Paul</HI> (who came not behind the chiefest Apostles) to cry out, <HI>Who is sufficient for these things;</HI> how much more might it make the ablest of Ordinary Ministers to do so? A great variety of Gifts and endowments (not to be obtain'd without a course of intense laborious Study and Prayer) deep Hu∣mility of mind, unfainting application and unshaken resolution, unwearied supplies and fresh anointings from Christ the Head of Influences, are needful to a right dis∣charge of the Work of the Ministry. These things should be seriously consider'd of, by those who think of engaging in that most weighty Work; that so with due Preparations of Soul, and dependance on God, they may enter upon it. They should gladly use such helps, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tend to fit them for, and quicken them to, a right discharge of their duty. Among such helps, <HI>the fol∣lowing Sermon</HI> may well be numbred. 'Twas Preach'd (tho' not so large as 'tis now Printed) by the Worthy <HI>Author,</HI> on the Day of his Ordination; and 'tis now
<PB N="iii" REF="001956_0004_0FBA400C6B1B1478"/>
Publish'd, in Answer to Importunate Sollicitations, and at desire also the Enlargements were made. This Importunity argues not his backwardness to oblige Friends; but his modest opinion of his own perfor∣mances, and his unwillingness to appear so early in Print, (being very Young) lest any should censure him for too much forwardness. Such a censure in this case, would be very <HI>groundless.</HI> His principal design in Studying this Sermon (as he declares) was not so much the in∣structing of <HI>others</HI> in the Work of the Ministry, as the learning more clearly <HI>his own</HI> duty, and getting the sense of it more deeply impress'd on his <HI>own</HI> mind. But now 'tis Publish'd, I wish others may be as much bene∣fited in Reading, as he was in Studying, of it. Those Sermons, which are most worthy of Commendation, have least (or no) need of it; they commend themselves; I think this may be numbred among such. Sure I am, the things contained herein, are highly worthy of the deepest and most serious consideration, of all Gospel-Mi∣nisters. I hope by perusing of it, I am more humbly sensible of my own deficiencies, then I was before; &amp; my desire is, that for the future I may be quicken'd to act in my Station, more agreeably to what is here very solidly and cogently inculcated. I wish that all Ministers would (as this Sermon directs) make it their chief Business to <HI>Preach Christ,</HI> to show Men their <HI>need</HI> of Him, &amp; His <HI>suitableness</HI> &amp; <HI>sufficiency</HI> for them; endeavouring that they may be rightly acquainted with Him, united to Him, and more conform'd in <HI>heart &amp; life</HI> to His <HI>Image, Pre∣cepts</HI>
<PB N="iv" REF="001956_0005_0FBA400EAB2929F0"/>
&amp; <HI>Example.</HI> Thus to <HI>Preach Christ,</HI> is more the <HI>duty</HI> &amp; <HI>honour</HI> of Ministers, than to show the greatest <HI>Learning</HI> in other matters, or to get the greatest <HI>applause</HI> for it. I esteem it a rich mercy of God to our <HI>Land,</HI> that He continues and smiles on our <HI>College,</HI> &amp; thence sends forth from time to time, able Ministers, to serve His Holy Churches in this Wilderness, as well as in some other Places: Praise be to God the Father of Lights, for this Great Blessing. This is the distinguishing Glory of <HI>New-England,</HI> wherein it differs from all other Plantations and Dispersions of the British Empire. I Pray, God con∣tinue our <HI>College</HI> a rich Blessing to His Churches, as long as the Sun and Moon endure. And I esteem it as a rich Blessing to that Flock of our Lord Jesus, to which I am an unworthy Pastor, that the Worthy Author of this Ser∣mon, (my Dear Brother &amp; Fellow Labourer,) was so unanimously and peaceably call'd to, and settled in, the Pastoral Office among them. I Pray God, long to conti∣nue his Life &amp; Health, and greatly &amp; constantly to in∣crease the Gifts &amp; Graces of His Good Spirit to him; and to make him very Faithful &amp; Successful in the weighty important Work he's engaged in, &amp; then to take him safe, tho' late, to His Heavenly Kingdom. And as for the Flock themselves, I Pray that they may be (and thanks be to God they are) a Blessing and a Comfort to those who watch for their Souls. <HI>My hearts desire and Prayer to God for them is, that they may be saved;</HI> that those who Preach and those who hear, may meet with Joy at Christ's Right Hand in the Great Day.</P>

<P>THEY are the Words of the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI>; and herein he has left a bright <HI>Specimen</HI> of his <HI>own</HI> conduct, for <HI>direction</HI> and <HI>incentive</HI> unto <HI>Ministers</HI> in the Service of the Gospel; and which there∣fore will afford <HI>reflections not unseasonable</HI> for the <HI>present</HI> Solemnity.</P>
<P>I shall not spend any of the few Minutes al∣lotted for this Discourse, in stating the <HI>Coherence,</HI> and relation of the Words unto the <HI>Context,</HI> but <HI>immediately</HI> apply my self to form some proper remarks upon them, under a more <HI>abstract</HI> conside∣ration. <HI>And I trust, that none will pervert, or transfer those things, which I design for immediate cautions to my self, as charges, or personal imputations on any o∣ther; and that none will now look upon me as standing here this Day, to dictate and prescribe unto others, so much as to my self.</HI></P>
<P>To <HI>begin,</HI> we may</P>
<P N="1">1. OBSERVE, What was the Apostle's great <HI>Work</HI> and Business. viz. <HI>Preaching. We Preach,</HI>

<P>HOW <HI>ignoble,</HI> how <HI>trivial</HI> and <HI>minute</HI> soever this Work may appear to some, how <HI>contemptible</HI> so∣ever this <HI>foolishness of Preaching,</HI> yet the Great <HI>Doctor</HI> of the Gentiles, a Star of the <HI>first</HI> Magni∣tude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.5. <HI>Act.</HI> 22.3.</NOTE> <HI>not a whit</HI> behind the very <HI>Chief</HI> of the A∣postles, <HI>bro't up</HI> at the feet of <HI>Gamaliel,</HI> and having profited <HI>above many</HI> in all the Learning both of <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Christians,</HI> tho't it <HI>no stoop</HI> to <HI>give himself to the Ministry of the Word.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Acts</HI> 6.4. <HI>Eph.</HI> 3.8. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.12. <HI>Act.</HI> 20.24</NOTE> <HI>Unto me</HI> (says he) is this <HI>Grace</HI> given that I should <HI>Preach</HI>—. For the <HI>which</HI> also I <HI>suffer, nevertheless</HI> I am <HI>not ashamed,</HI> neither count I my <HI>life dear</HI> to my self, so that I may finish the <HI>Ministry</HI> I have received of the Lord.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ro.</HI> 11.13.</NOTE> He took all occasions thus to <HI>magnify his Office,</HI> and in all his Writings we find interspers'd with a most pleasant variety, such notes of holy <HI>triumph</HI> and <HI>glorying</HI> in his <HI>Work.</HI></P>
<P>THE OBSERVATION here is this, namely,</P>
<P>THAT <HI>Preaching</HI> is one <HI>great,</HI> and <HI>noble</HI> part of the <HI>Pastoral</HI> Duty.</P>

So some understand that of the Apostle to Timothy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.15</NOTE> <HI>Study to shew thy self approved—rightly dividing the word of truth,</HI> i. e. duly methodizing and martialling Gospel-truths, unfolding &amp; distri∣buting the several branches of each truth in the most apt &amp; apposite manner.

Methodical pertinence and cohaerence then are to be study'd for. <HI>Order</HI> is the strength and glory of all thing.—</P>
<P>SO likewise <HI>Ministers</HI> must endeavour to <HI>prove</HI> every truth with the best <HI>Arguments</HI>; and to <HI>press</HI> every <HI>duty</HI> with the most prevaling <HI>motives,</HI> with all the <HI>artifices</HI> of persuasion, and the strongest <HI>enforcements</HI> of reason. Dogmatical assertion and a magisterial air seldom do, without the aids of sound demonstration, and the proper arts of in∣sinuation.

<P>MINISTERS then in Preaching must labour, to <HI>digest</HI> the materials into good <HI>order,</HI> to make all things <HI>plain, obvious</HI> and <HI>intelligible</HI> to the mind, and to recommend them to the conscience, and practic powers, with <HI>satisfactory evidence,</HI> and the most <HI>winning</HI> force of persuasion.</P>
