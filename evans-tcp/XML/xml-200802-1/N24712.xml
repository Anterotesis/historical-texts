<P>WHAT wantest thou? O my soul! with what imaginable excellency wouldst thou clothe thyself? What desirable object wouldst thou pitch upon? Is it beauty?

Wealth and riches are in the house of God; every one in his family shall have a rich, a glorious, an incorruptible and eternal inheritance among the saints. What is it then? Is it honor? What honor like to this, to be a friend and a favorite of God, and a spouse of Christ? To have a crown of righteousness, of life, and of glory? Yet more, a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory set upon thy head. Yet again, is it pleasure? The just shall enter in to their master's joy, and there are rivers of pleasure at

<P>I AM frail, and the world is fading; but my soul is immortal, and God is eternal. If I pitch, upon the creature, either, they may take wings like an eagle that flieth towards heaven, or my soul may take its way with the rich fool, and go to hell; but if I chuse God for my portion, then mercy and goodness shall follow me whilst I live, and glory and eternity shall crown me when I die.

<HEAD>Spiritual Joy and Sorrow.</HEAD>
<P>AS there is a sad mirth, so there is a joyful mourning: look upon the voluptuous man, however laughter may appear in his face, yet sadness ever centers in the heart; his carnal delights are not only in vain, but vexing; like music, they play him into a melancholy fit: whilst the banquet lasts, the sensualist sings: but when the reckoning comes, his spirit sinks, his burning candle presently goes out in a stink∣ing snuff, his shining sun instantly sets in the watry cloud. Solomon gives us the sum of it thus: Even in laughter the heart is sorrow∣ful, and the end of that mirth is heaviness. But now come to the penitential person, as his tears are the joy of angels, so they are the joy of his heart, and the solace of his soul; the falter his tears, the sweeter his comforts; the deeper his sighs, the fuller his joy; the beams of con∣solation always shine into this house of mourn∣ing, so that his soulis in his travail with a Bar∣nabas, and his labours bring forth the fruits of peace; insomuch, that I may truly say, to mourn for sin, is to weep for joy. These pure and pleasant streams of consolation (which is the worldlings wonder) that flow and run in those crystal rivers of eternal pleasure, at God's, right hand, they come from a weeping spring. Why then is the mouth of wickedness opened against the way of holiness? As if grace were the calvary to intomb joys; and impiety the very womb to bring forth felicity; but if ex∣perience
<PB N="7" REF="032741_0007_0FF50887C3487FF8"/>
may be heard, my soul hath felt both, and I find such damps of spirit in the worldly pleasures, and such refreshing of soul in the depth of godly sorrow, that I shall esteem one drop of such spiritual joy, better than an ocean of their mirth.</P>
<LG>
<L>AND let this feeble body fail,</L>
<L>And let it faint or die;</L>
<L>My soul shall quit the mournful vale,</L>
<L>And soar to worlds on high:</L>
<L>Shall join the disembody'd saints,</L>
<L>And find its long sought rest,</L>
<L>(That only rest for which it pants)</L>
<L>On the Redeemer's breast.</L>
<L>In hope of that immortal crown,</L>
<L>I now the cross sustain;</L>
<L>And gladly wander up and down,</L>
<L>And smile at toil and pain.</L>
<L>I travel my appointed years.</L>

<P>IT was proudly said by Caesar, crossing (un∣known) the sea, being in a little bark, in a tempestuous storm, when they were ready to be swallowed up by the waves, perceiving the courage of the pilot to fail, fear not, for thou carriest Caesar. How truly may a gracious spirit say in the midst of all desertions, afflic∣tions, and tribulations, Fear nothing, O my soul, thou carriest Jesus Christ? What though the windows of heaven be opened for a storm, or the fountains of the deep broke up for a flood, desertions from above, afflictions from below; yet God that sits in heaven will not cast away his son, Christ that lives in me will not let me sink; the swelling waves, I know, are but to set me nearer heaven, and the deeps are but to make me awake my master. Prize thy Christ; they shall not drown thee, there∣fore connot daunt me: for while I sail with Christ, I am sure to land with Christ.</P>

<P>The Israelites must first pass over Jordan before they land in Canaan; but no sooner did the feet of the priests that bare the ark of the covenant, rest in the water, but the proud way <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> saw it and fled, and the swelling streams were driven back, and laid in heaps to make them pass over safe and well; so every child of God is like an Israelite in the wilderness of this world, travelling to the land of promise; death is that Jordan that runs between this wilderness and our Canaan; it is that swelling stream that overflows the banks of every mor∣tal creature; it is that last river which must be passed over; but this is the happiness of a child of God, that Jesus Christ, our high priest, that bears the everlasting covenant on his shoulders, hath already dipt his feet in the brims of this water, insomuch that the streams of bitterness are diverted, the sting of death plucked out, and the water of the salt sea is dri∣ed up; the power of the curse cut off, so that death is but a sure step unto glory. Why then am I afraid to die? The channel is dry, I see the footsteps of my Saviour in the bottom, and heaven and happiness on the other side; so that the waters shall not go over my soul: they may go over my sins, they may go over my miseries, they may go over my troubles; but my soul shall go over to its rest. Lord, there∣fore sit and sanctify me for my removal, and then I cannot be too soon with thee.</P>

<HEAD>The absence of God on Earth.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT is hell, what is damnation, but an exclusion from thy presence? 'Tis the want of that which gives the regions of darkness all their horror. What is heaven, what are the satisfactions of angels, but the views of thy glo∣ry? What but thy smiles and complacence are the springs of their immortal transports!</P>
<P>Without the light of thy countenance, what privilege is my being? what canst thou thyself give me to countervail the infinite loss? Could the riches, the empty glories, and insipid plea∣sures

<P>There was a time (but ah! that happy time is past, those blissful minutes gone) when, with a modest assurance, I could call thee "my Father, my almighty Friend, my de∣fence, my hope, and my exceeding great re∣ward:" But those glorious advantages are lost, those ravishing prospects withdrawn, and to my trembling soul thou doest no more ap∣pear but as a consuming fire, an inaccessible majesty, my severe judge, and my omnipotent adversary; and who shall deliver me out of thy hands? where shall I find a shelter from thy wrath? what shades can cover me from thy all-seeing eye?</P>

I owe my life to thee, nay a thousand lives if I had them; but it is not my life, but my memory and thoughts thou art calling for; it is not to die for thee, but to remember thee. Didst thou drink the cup of wrath on the cross for me, and will not I drink a cup of blessing at the table for thee, nay for myself, and for my eternal salvation?</P>
<P>Let me go then to this holy table, with faith, love, and thankfulness, to remember Christ and his dying love; as he commands me.—And while I remember him, let me also re∣ceive and embrace him as my bleeding High Priest, in the arms of my faith, and at the same time throw my guilty soul into his wound∣ed arms, for saving me from wrath.—Let me go and remember the wounding and piercings of my Redeemer, with a pierced and wound∣ed heart for these cursed sins, which nailed and killed the Prince of Life.

Thou didst prepare for the waters their capacious bed, and by thy power set bounds to the raging billows: by thee the vallies were cloathed in their flowery pride, and the moun∣tains crowned with groves. In all the won∣derful effects of nature we adore and confess thy power; thou utterest thy voice in thunder, and dost scatter lightning abroad, thou ridest on the wings of the wind, the mountains smoke, and the forests tremble at thy approach the sum∣mer and winter, the shady night and the bright revolutions of the day, are thine.</P>

From thee every thing that lives receives its breath, and by thee are all upheld in life. Thy providence reaches the least insect; for thou art good, and thy care extends to all thy works.

<P>O how much is to be learned by a storm? It is God that raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves of the sea; they mount up to heaven, they go down to the depths. How awful are the exhibitions of the Almighty? What wonders of judgment and mercy his word produces? The stormy winds fulfil his word. O how dreadful to fall into the hands of God, with whom is such terrible ma∣jesty! Sinners may think lightly of his wrath.

Dost thou, indolent, in∣solent sinner, imagine thou canst contend with God, or cope with Omnipotence? Try thy power in some smaller matters: stop the sun in its rapid progress; bring back the seasons and invert them; bid the flowers spring up in winter, or drive in the severities of frost and snow upon harvest; or do but command these winds to cease, which rage with such impetu∣ous fury. If thou canst not preserve thy body from dropping into the grave, and render it immortal, how cast thou keep the soul from sinking into hell? Does many a hardy mari∣ner who before seemed neither to fear God or regard Man, tremble like a leaf when shaken with the wind, and is he even at his wits end in this tumult of the ocean? what then will the sinner do, when God shall call forth all his wrath? and how will the now obdurate Miscre∣ant be able to stand when the whole storm of vengeance shall be sent against him, and beat upon him with a fury and power which eye never saw, and heart never felt? He may now like Leviathan, laugh at the shaking of the spear, and the sword may be to him as rot∣ten wood, when brandished in the threaten∣ings of the Almighty; but when these threat∣enings

<P>But, blessed be God, there is a covert from such storms, sweet character of the blessed Re∣deemer! if none can abide the day of God's, wrath, when the cedars of Lebanon are torn from their roots, and the rocks are thrown down before him, hide me, O hide me, with uplifted hands, a melted heart, and flowing eyes, I entreat thee hide me in the hollow of thine hand, in thy suffering and bleeding heart. Do the birds of the air, and the beasts of the field from an instinct of nature foresee the ap∣proaching shower and make haste to the re∣treat? let my hopes wast me on the wings of faith to thy blessed self, who callest thyself an∣hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest.</P>

<HEAD>A Common Occurence moralized.</HEAD>
<P>AS Theophron, one evening, was sitting sol∣itary by the fire, which was sunk low, and glimmering in ashes, he mused on the sorrows that surrounded human nature, and beset the spirits that dwell in flesh. By chance he cast his eye on a worm which was lodged on the sa∣fer end of a short fire-brand: It seemed very
<PB N="51" REF="032741_0051_0FF50A21CE3CE9A8"/>
uneasy at its warmstation, writhing and stretch∣ing itself every way for relief. He watched the creeping creature in all its motions. "I saw it," said he, when he told this incident to Phiemus, "I saw it reach forward, and there it met the living coal; backward, and on each side, and then it touched the burning embers: Still starting from the present torment, it re∣treated and shrunk away from every place where it had just before sought a refuge, and still met with new disquietude and pain.</P>
<P>"At last I observed," said he, "that having turned on all sides in vain, it lifted its head up∣ward, and raised its length as high as possible in the air, where it found nothing to annoy it; but the chief part of the body still lay prone on the wood; its lower or worser half hung heavy on the aspiring animal, and forbid its ascent. How happy, would the worm have been, could it then have put on wings and be∣come a flying insect!</P>
<P>"Such," said he, "is the case of every holy soul on earth; it is out of its proper element, like the worm lodged among hot embers. The uneasy spirit is sometimes ready to stretch its powers, its desires and wishes on every side, to find rest and happiness among sensible goods; but these things instead of satisfying its nobler appetites, rather give some new pain, variety of vexation, and everlasting disappointment. The soul finding every experiment vain, retires and shrinks backward from all mortal objects,
<PB N="52" REF="032741_0052_0FF50A325A695658"/>
and being touched with divine influence, it rais∣es itself up towards heaven to seek its God; but the flesh, the body, the meaner and worser half of the man, hangs heavy, and drags it down again, that it cannot ascend thither, where rest and ease are only to be found.</P>
<P>"What should such a soul do now, but pant and long hourly for a flight to the upper world, and breathe after the moment of its release? What would be more joyful to such a spirit, than the divine and almighty summons to de∣part from flesh? O blessed voice from heaven that shall say to it, <HI>Come up hither;</HI> and in the same instant shall break off all its fetters, give it the wings of an angel, and inspire it with double zeal to ascend!"</P>

<HEAD>THE VISION OF MIRZA.</HEAD>
<P>ON the fifth day of the moon, which, ac∣cording to the custom of my forefathers, I al∣ways keep holy, after having washed myself, and offered up my morning devotions, I as∣cended
<PB N="57" REF="032741_0057_0FF4D43AB5AD4988"/>
the high hills of Bagdat, in order to pass the rest of the day in meditation and pray∣er. As I was here airing myself on the tops of the mountains, I fell into a profound con∣templation on the vanity of human life; and passing from one thought to another, surely, said I, man is but a shadow, and life a dream. Whilst I was thus amusing, I cast my eyes to∣wards the summit of a rock that was not far from me, where I discovered one in the habit of a shepherd, with a little musical instrument in his hand. As I looked upon him, he appli∣ed it to his lips, and began to play upon it. The sound of it was exceeding sweet, and wrought into a variety of tunes that were inexpressibly melodious, and altogether different from any thing I had ever heard: they put me in mind of those heavenly airs that are played to the de∣parted souls of good men upon their first arri∣val in Paradise, to wear out the impressions of the last agonies, and qualify them for the pleas∣ures of that happy place. My heart melted away in secret raptures.</P>
<P>I had often been told that the rock before me was the haunt of a genius; and that sever∣al had been entertained with that music, who had passed by it, but never heard that the mu∣sician had before made himself visible. When he had raised my thoughts by those transport∣ing airs which he played, to taste the pleasures of his conversation, as I looked upon him, like one astonished, he beckoned to me and by the
<PB N="58" REF="032741_0058_0FF50A9288766990"/>
waving of his hand directed me to approach the place where he sat. I drew near with that reverence which is due to a superior natures, and as my heart was entirely subdued by the captivating strains I had heard, I fell down at his feet and wept. The genius smiled upon me with a look of compassion and affability that familiarized him to my imagination, and at once dispelled all the fears and apprehensions with which I approached him. He lifted me from the ground, and taking me by the hand, "Mirza," said he, "I have heard thee in thy soliloques: follow me:"</P>
<P>He then led me to the highest pinnacle of the rock, and placing me on the top of it, "Cast thy eyes eastward," said he, "and tell me what thou feest." "I see," said I, "a huge valley, and prodigious tide of water rolling through it." The valley thou seest, said he, is the vale of misery, and the tide of water that thou seest is part of the great tide of eternity. What is the reason, said I, that the tide I see rises out of a thick mist at one end, and again loses itself in a thick mist at the other? What thou seest, said he, is that portion of eternity which is called time measured out by the sun, and reach∣ing from the begining of the world to its con∣summation. Examine now, said he, this sea that is bounded with darkness at both ends, and tell me what thou discoverest in it? I see a bridge, said I, standing in the midst of the tide. The bridge thou seest, said he, is human life;
<PB N="59" REF="032741_0059_0FF50AA2A9CB3030"/>
consider it attentively. Upon a more leisurely survey of it, I found that it consisted of three∣score and ten entire arches, with several bro∣ken arches, which, added to those that were entire, made up the number about an hundred. As I was counting the arches, the genius told me that the bridge consisted at first of a thou∣sand arches; but that a great flood swept away the rest, and left the bridge in the ruinous condition I now behold it; but tell me further, said he, what thou discoverest on it? I see mul∣titudes of people passing over it, said I, and a black cloud hanging on each end of it. As I looked more attentively, I saw several of the passengers dropping through the bridge, into the great tide that flowed underneath it; and I saw innumerable trap-doors that lay conceal∣ed in the bridge, which the passengers no sooner trod upon but they fell through them into the tide, and immediately disappeared. These hid∣en pit-falls were set very thick at the entrance of the bridge, so that throngs of people no sooner broke through the cloud than many of them fell into them. They grew thinner to∣wards the middle, but multiplied and lay closer together towards the end of the arches that were entire.</P>
<P>There were indeed some persons, but their number was very small, that continued a kind of hobbling march on the broken arches, but fell through one after another, being quite tir∣ed and spent with so long a walk.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="032741_0060_0FF50AB5B2121998"/>
I passed some time in the contemplation of this wonderful structure, and the great variety of objects which it presented. My heart was filled with a deep melancholy to see several dropping unexpectedly in the midst of mirth and jollity, and catching at every thing that stood by them to save themselves. Some were looking up towards the heavens in a thoughtful posture, and in the midst of a sup∣plication stumbled and fell out of sight. Multi∣tudes were very busy in the pursuit of bubbles that glittered in their eyes and danced before them; but often when they thought them∣selves within the reach of them, their footing failed, and down they sunk. In this confu∣sion of objects, I observed some with scimitars in their hands, and others with urinals, who ran to and fro upon the bridge, thrusting sev∣eral persons on trap-doors which did not seem to lie in their way, and which they might have escaped, had they not been thus forced upon them.</P>
<P>The genius seeing me indulge myself in this melancholy prospect, told me I had dwelt long enough upon it; Take thine eyes off the bridge, said he, and tell me if thou seest any thing thou dost not comprehend. Upon looking up, What mean, said I, those great flights of birds that are perpetually hovering about the bridge, and settling upon it from time to time? I see vultures, harpies, ravens, cormorants, and among many other feathered creatures several
<PB N="61" REF="032741_0061_0FF50AC3263470F8"/>
little winged boys, that pearch in great num∣bers upon the middle arches. These, said the genius, are envy, avarice, superstition despair, love, with the like cares and passions that infest human life.</P>
<P>I here fetched a deep sigh; Alas! said I, man was made in vain! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow is he given away to misery and mortality! tortured in life, and swallowed up in death! The genius being moved with compassion towards me, bid me quit so uncomfortable a prospect. Look no more, said he, on man in the first stage of his existence, in his setting out for eternity? but cast thine eye on that thick mist into which the tide bears the several generations of mortals that fall into it. I directed my sight as I was ordered, and (whether or no the good genius strengthened it with any supernatural force, or dissipated part of the mist that was before too thick for the eye to penetrate) I saw the valley opening at the farther end, and spread∣ing forth into an immense ocean, that had a huge rock of adamant running through the midst of it, and dividing it into two equal parts. The clouds still rested on one half thereof, in∣somuch that I could discover nothing in it: but the other appeared to me a vast ocean planted with innumerable islands, that were covered with fruits and flowers, and interwo∣ven with a thousand little shining seas that ran among them. I could see persons dressed in glorious habits with garlands upon their heads,
<PB N="62" REF="032741_0062_0FF50AD3B083A5B0"/>
passing among the trees, lying down by the sides of fountains, or resting on beds of flow∣ers; and could hear a confused harmony of singing birds, falling waters, human voices and musical instruments. Gladness grew in me upon the discovery of so delightful a scene. I wished for the wings of an eagle that I might fly away to those happy seats; but the genius told me there was no passage to them, except through the gates of death that I saw opening every moment upon the bridge. The islands, said he, that lie so fresh and green before thee, and with which the whole of the ocean ap∣pears spotted as far as thou canst see, are more in number than the sand on the sea-shore; there are myriads of islands behind those which thou here discoverest, reaching further than thine eye, or even thine imagination can ex∣tend itself. These are the mansions of good men after death, who according to the degree and kinds of virtue in which they excelled, are distributed among these several islands, which abound with pleasure of different kinds and degrees, suitable to the relishes and per∣fections of those who are settled in them; ev∣ery island is a paradise accommodated to its respective inhabitants. Are not these, O Mir∣za, habitations worth contending for; Does life appear miserable, that gives thee opportu∣nities of earning such a reward? Is death to be feared that will convey thee to so happy an existence? Think not man made in vain, who
<PB N="63" REF="032741_0063_0FF4D43C4A330DB0"/>
has such an eternity reserved for him. I gazed with inexpressible pleasure on these happy isl∣ands. At length, said I, shew me now, I be∣seech thee, the secrets that lie hid under those dark clouds, which cover the ocean on the other side of the rock of adamant. The ge∣nius making me no answer, I turned about to address myself to him a second time, but I found he had left me; I then turned again to the vision which I had been so long contem∣plating; but instead of the rolling tide, the arched bridge, and the happy islands, I saw nothing but the long hollow vally of Bagdat, with oxen, sheep, and camels grazing upon the sides of it.</P>

<HEAD>The VISION of AMANDA.</HEAD>
<P>METHOUGHT I was walking through a delightful field from whence on a rising hill I beheld a stately edifice. My curiosity led me to make up towards it. I found it surrounded with gardens and orchards, richly decked by nature and art. A most agreeable lady was standing at the door who very courteously in∣vited me in to sit down and rest me: being tir∣ed with the hill, I accepted her kind offer.—Entering the house, I surveyed the magnificent apartments, and my eyes were dazzled with the rich furniture that adorned every room. The lady led me into a spacious parlour, where was a very comely gentleman, with several little beauties around him, the living pictures in miniature of the father and mother. I was
<PB N="64" REF="032741_0064_0FF50AF8DF125498"/>
entertained there with a liberality suitable to the appearance they made and with that cour∣teous affability, which is the genuine effect of true gentility and good breeding. Whilst with pleasure I surveyed their happy circumstance, which appeared to have no want of any thing to complete their felicity, I said within myself; Sure these are extraordinary persons, and this flow of prosperity must be the bountiful reward of Providence, for some eminent instance of virtue and piety. But when I had taken my leave, and was returning back, I met one, of whom I enquired the gentleman's character who was the owner of yonder seat; which, to my no small surprise, I found to be very vi∣cious. His plentiful estate was gotten by op∣pression and fraud, his beautiful children were the living monuments of his shame, and the la∣dy who made so splendid an appearance, and to whom he discovered so much seeming ten∣derness was so far from being mistress of the feat, that she was only kept there as under a ty∣rant, to be a slave to his base lusts, he consult∣ing her satisfaction no farther than as the pleas∣ure in her countenance heightens her charms, and thereby renders her the more agreeable to him in the gratification of his brutish appetites and passions; and she, continued my informer, puts a constant force upon herself to appear gay and cheerful, lest her keeper should turn her out, abandoned to shame and misery. To preserve her from the latter of which (after
<PB N="65" REF="032741_0065_0FF50B087233C2C8"/>
the loss of a good fortune) was she prevailed on to comply with the lot she shares. As soon as I parted from my company, I could con∣tain no longer, but burst out into this excla∣mation: Wherefore, O Prosperity, wherefore is it that thou thus daily loadest the vicious with thy benefits, and givest them all that heart can wish? Whence comes it to pass, that such a wretch as this shall spend his days in case, and his nights in pleasure, whilst thou turnest away with disdain from the pious man, leaving him to groan under all the hardships of the most adverse state! O say! whence is it that thou art thus partial to the wicked? I had no sooner ceased exclaiming in this manner, than looking forward, I saw Prosperity standing be∣fore me arrayed, in her most gorgeous attire. The gay and glittering appearance must have raised delight in my breast, had it not been damped by the anger that appeared on her brow, when she thus addressed me; Forbear taxing me with partiality in my proceedings; for were it in my inclination, it is not in my power, being only the servant of Providence, whose orders I never, in one single instance, run counter to. Art thou, said I, in a heat, the servant of Providence? a just, holy, wise, and powerful Providence! And will it suffer thee thus to caress the impious, and slight and contemn the good! How can these things be? Prosperity disappeared without making any re∣ply; but immediately a resplendant light shone
<PB N="66" REF="032741_0066_0FF50B170F6E2648"/>
around me, and I heard a majestic voice call∣ing thus to me from above, O thou blind mor∣tal, dost thou dare to call in question my pro∣ceedings, because thou canst not see the wisdom and equity of them? It would be just in me to punish thee severely for thy rashness, but for once I will overlook thy ignorance, and so far condescend to thy weakness as to give thee some view of the reasons of my conduct.—Wherefore lift up thine eyes, and behold what shall now be discovered to thee. I did so, and found my sight strengthened to penetrate thro' the thick clouds, beyond which I saw Provi∣dence seated on a lofty throne, and by him stood Prosperity and Adversity with their various attendants waiting his orders. A per∣son of a very amiable countenance stood at my right hand, who told me he was commission∣ed to resolve my doubts, and reveal somewhat of the mysteries of Providence to me. I straight observed Adversity ordered with her attendant Pain to such a place. I looked after them, and saw them enter the house of a person very remarkable for piety, and attack him in a most violent manner. Alas! said I to my instructor, whence comes it to pass that so good a man as this should be so severely handled? He is, re∣plied he, a very eminent Christian, a man greatly beloved of his God. But how contra∣ry soever this may seem to your carnal reason, it is therefore that he is thus afflicted; he has (as the best here have) much sin still remaining
<PB N="67" REF="032741_0067_0FF50B2410871828"/>
in him, and much wanting to complete his per∣fection in grace and holiness; and God, who is alone the proper judge of the most likely means to bring about his own wise and kind designs, sees this the fittest method to root out sin, and strengthen and invigorate his graces. This affliction shall be to him a furnace, not to consume him, but his lusts, and to refine and brighten his graces, that they may shine with greater lustre. I then looked up again, and saw Adversity with two of her attendants, Poverty and Sickness, sent to another place. They soon attacked a person, who from an af∣fluent fortune was reduced to penury and want, and from a strong and vigorous state of health, was thrown upon a sick bed. Pray, said I, what is the character of this person, that is thus doubly attacked, and with such violence? He is, replied my instructor, one that devoted him∣self to God in days of his youth, and appear∣ed very zealous and active in the ways of re∣ligion, at his first setting out. But a long se∣ries of prosperity, with which he has been fa∣voured, has had the but too common effect of ensnaring and captivating his thoughts and affections to the things of time and sense. As riches en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reased, he has set his heart inordin∣ately upon them, and in a great measure with∣drawn his dependance upon God for the conti∣nuation of those bounties of Providence, grown careless and secure, saying with David, My mountain stands strong; I shall never be mov∣ed
<PB N="68" REF="032741_0068_0FF50B3EE902D338"/>
Poverty is therefore sent to waste his sub∣stance, that the idol being removed, he may be no longer tempted to adore it, and that he may, by his own experience, be convinced of the uncertainty of all sublunary good. A long continued state of health has abated his sense of value of the mercy, and he has seemed to slight it as a common saver. Sickness is there∣fore sent to teach him the worth of health, by the want of it; to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this seemingly strong building, that he may see its foundation is in the dust, and that it is a moth crushed in the hand of God. In a word, these painful strokes shall be the means of rousing him out of that spiritual lethargy wherein he has long lain, and cause him to remember whence he is fall∣en, excite him to repent, and do his first works? and when these most valuable ends are answer∣ed, God will turn his captivity, and remarka∣bly display his power and love in his deliver∣ance. Again I looked up, and heard adversi∣ty receive a new commission, to attack with reproach and contempt a person who appear∣ed in sight. Pray, said I, to what person are these formidable spectres going? (for their ap∣pearance shocked me more than all the others.) He is, said my teacher, a very serious good man, one that has for many years been uni∣versally esteemed amongst those who are true friends to religion and virtue, both for his wis∣dom and piety; but this general regard paid to him has too much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his mind, and he has hereby been pussed up with self∣applause;
<PB N="69" REF="032741_0069_0FF50B4E70D603A0"/>
not duly considering that whatever endowments he possesses, whether of nature or grace, are all received from God, and that therefore all the glory should be ascribed to the donor. Reproach is now sent to humble him, to hide pride from his eyes, to make him fully sensible that the interest any have in man's esteem is a blessing which descends from the same hand that dispenses those qualifications that have a tendency to raise it. Soon after I lifted up my eyes again, and saw Adversity with her attendants, Sickness and Death, re∣ceiving their orders to seize the child of a cer∣tain person. Now, says my instructor, this is a sincere Christian, and the stroke to be in∣flicted is perhaps the forest of a temporal na∣ture that could befal him. He is to be stript of an only child, and, a very promising one, in whom the fond parent might justly please him∣self with the prospect of much comfort and satisfaction? and like good Jacob, <HI>His life seems to be bound up in the lad's life.</HI> But Providence, in much wisdom and great goodness too, or∣ders his removal; in kindness both to parent and child; the lad being by the grace of God prepared for a better state, is in great love re∣moved from all the snares and temptations that attend the youthful stage, and those oth∣er snares and trials that surround the man in his riper age: a more than common share of which must have fallen to his lot had he con∣tinued in this world. The parent will hereby
<PB N="70" REF="032741_0070_0FF50B5C029BC150"/>
be convinced of, and humbled for the evil he has been guilty of in setting his heart and af∣fections too much on this so desirable a crea∣ture enjoyment, which he sees now to be but a fading, dying flower. And the supports and comforts he shall receive unden this heavy tri∣al will stop the mouth of complaints, and force him to confess that God is the alone proper object of our warmest affection, since there is enough in him to make the Christian happy in the loss of the dearest earthly comforts. These (continued my teacher) are some of the seem∣ing paradoxes in Providence, which thou, blind mortal, couldst not discover by the dim light of reason; there are others which I am not permitted to reveal to thee; some of which thou wilt never see unravelled whilst thou art cloathed with mortality. Let what thou hast seen and heard suffice to assure thee, that God's thoughts are not like to thine but as far above them in wisdom, as the heavens are above the earth. Hence it is, that the wick∣ed so oft abound with this world's good, who have all their heaven here: whilst the pious man is, by the sharp attacks of Adversity, dur∣ing the short term of his existence here, train∣ing up for a state of endless unallayed happiness.</P>
<P>I thanked my instructor, begged pardon for my rashness, and promised, that I would no more arraign Divine Providence at the bar of my weak and shallow reason; and abashed and confounded at my ignorance and presumption, awoke from my dream.</P>

And yet if we ask those who dwell around us in our nation, do you not believe a heaven and an eternity of happiness for those who seek it sincerely, and labor f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r it? they con∣fess this divine truth by the force of reason and conscience, and by the light of scripture; but they forget it in a few moments and return to their follies again, and with a greedy and in∣cessant desire they repeat the pursuit of perish∣ing vanities.</P>

to shine like a son of God in such a dark and vicious world, amongst men of degenerate minds, who have an aversion to all that is holy and heavenly. We would fain be always in the mode, and are afraid to be looked at in the dress of piety among thousand whose neg∣lect of God have stamped the fashion. Are there not several such Christians amongst us, who dare not open their lips in the language of paradise, nor let the world know they belong to heaven, till death and the invisible state are brought near them, and set in full view by some severe sickness, or some terrible accident which threatens their removal hence? It is a near view of the grave and eternity, that sub∣dues all other passions into devotion, that makes them begin to speak and act publicly like the children of God, and gives them a sa∣cred fortitude, a blessed superiority of soul over all their foolish fears, and all the reproaches of sinful men.</P>

<P>THE light of nature, duly attended to will evidently lead us into belief of a Supreme Be∣ing, infinitely holy, powerful, just, and good, the creator and preserver of all things, the friend and judge of mankind.</P>
<P>It is therefore our duty as well as highest interest often, at stated times, and by decent and solemn acts, to contemplate and adore the great original of our existence, the parent of all beauty, and of all good; to express our veneration and love by an awful and devout recognition of his perfections; and to evidence our gratitude, by celebrating his goodness, and thankfully acknowledging all his benefits. It is like wise our duty▪ by proper exercises of sor∣row and humiliation, to confess our ingrati∣tude and folly, to signify our dependence upon God, and our confidence in his goodness, by imploring his blessing and gracious concur∣rence in assisting the weakness, and curing the corruption of our nature. And, finally, to testify our sense of his authority and our faith in his government, by devoting ourselves to do his will, and resigning ourselves to his dispo∣sal. This is that internal piety or the worship of the mind which unassisted reason dictates,

You may quickly know a soul that doth con∣verse, and is familiar with Jesus Christ; you shall see it shining forth with the glories of Christ: as wisdom makes the face to shine, so Jesus Christ makes the soul to shine; so that he that judiciously looks upon him can divine that that soul hath met with, and seen the Lord. I see by the reflection of the beams of righteousness, he has been long viewing the son of righteousness; he carries the very im∣age of Christ upon him, and the very beauties of Christ about him; he looks like Christ and speaks like Christ, he walks and lives like Christ, he resembles, and knows he comes from Christ. That soul which is always be∣holding the glory of the Lord shall be chan∣ged into his image from glory to glory. If that soul be so glorious that beholds God darkly, reflectively, as in a glass, and enjoys God at a distance, how glorious shall that soul be, that shall see him clearly and distinctly, face to face, and enjoy his immediate commu∣nion with Jesus Christ? We shall then be like him indeed, when we shall see him as he is; our bodies shall be like his; our glory shall be like his; our eternity shall be like his; who is the God of beauty, excellency, and sweetness, concord, happiness and eternity.
