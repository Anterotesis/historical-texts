<P>A CONTINUATION Of the REVEREND Mr. <HI>Whitefield'</HI>s JOURNAL,</P>
<P>From his ARRIVAL at <HI>Savannah, May</HI> 7. His Stay there till <HI>July</HI> 25. From thence to <HI>Frede∣rica,</HI> at which Place he arriv'd <HI>August</HI> 8. His Return to <HI>Savannah</HI> again <HI>August</HI> 16. His De∣parture from thence to <HI>Charlestown, South Caro∣lina.</HI> From which Place he took his Passage on Board Capt. <HI>Coc,</HI> bound to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>A particular Account of his dangerous Voyage, while he was nine Weeks and three Days upon the Seas, Provisions almost gone, the whole Ship's Crew in a perishing Condition, till their Arrival at <HI>Ireland,</HI> (having then but about half a Pint of Water) there they landed. From thence Mr. WHITEFIELD travelled by Land till he arriv'd in LONDON.</P>
<P>With a PREFACE, giving the Reason, why he publishes a Continuation of his JOURNALS.</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the Journals already published, were printed with∣out my Knowledge, yet as GOD has been pleased to let me see, by Letters sent to me, that he has greatly blessed them, I now upon the Importunity of Friends, con∣sent to the publishing a Continu∣ation of them, that those pious Persons who have interceded in my Behalf, may see what GOD, in answer to their Prayers, has done for my Soul.</P>
<P><PB REF="004855_0002_100E02B5D91ED4F8"/>
I am sensible that this, as well as every Thing else of such a Na∣ture, must necessarily meet with great Contempt from natural Men, who are Strangers to the Influ∣ence of the HOLY GHOST up∣on the Heart. But what have I to do with them? If any of GOD's Children receive the least Conso∣lation from my Experiences, <HI>Let almost, formal Christians be offen∣ded, and the Scoffers of these last Days mock on.</HI>—<HI>I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A CONTINUATION OF Mr. WHITEFIELD's JOURNAL, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>SUNDAY, <HI>May</HI> 7. Arrived at <HI>Savannah</HI> Town about seven this Evening, and joined in Prayer, and a Psalm of Thanksgiving with Mr. <HI>Dela∣motte,</HI> and some pious Souls that were rejoiced at my Arrival: <HI>The Good LORD sanctify our Meet∣ing to his Glory, and his People's Welfare.</HI></P>
<P>Spent the Remainder of the Evening in taking sweet Counsel with Mr. <HI>Delamotte,</HI> who seems pro∣videntially left behind at <HI>Savannah</HI> against my com∣ing. How sweetly does Providence order Things for us! <HI>Oh may I constantly follow it as the wise Men did the Star in the East.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, May</HI> 8. Begun to read pubilck Prayers, and expounded the second Lesson at five in the Morn∣ing to seventeen Adults and twenty five Children. <HI>May GOD open their Hearts that they may attend to the Things that were spoken.</HI></P>
<P>In the Afternoon, Mr. <HI>Causlon</HI> sent Word, that he and the Magistrates would wait upon me, but I chose rather to wait upon them, I was received
<PB N="6" REF="004855_0003_100E02B819CF0288"/>
with great Civility, and our chief Conversation ran upon the Place of my Settlement; at last it was resolved that I should have a House and Tabernacle built at <HI>Frederica,</HI> and serve at <HI>Savannah,</HI> when, and as long as I pleased. I find there are many Di∣visions amongst the Inhabitants, but GOD, I hope, will make me an Instrument of composing them: <HI>Grant this, O Lord, for thy dear Son's Sake.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, May,</HI> 14. After another Week's Confine∣ment, by the Return of my Fever, under which God shewed me great Mercies, and which went off with a Fit of the Ague, I attempted to read Prayers, but was so exceeding faint and weak, that I was obliged to leave off before I begun the second Service. <HI>Oh that my Friends had seen me at that Hour, they then might have learnt not to have any Man's Person in Admiration, and not to think more highly of me than they ought to think.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, May</HI> 16. Having by the Blessing of GOD gotten a little Strength, I went to see <HI>Tomo Chachi,</HI> who, I heard, was near expiring at a Neighbour's House. He lay on a Blanket thin and meagre, and little else but Skin and Bones. <HI>Senauki</HI> sat by fanning him with some <HI>Indian</HI> Feathers. There was no body that could talk <HI>English,</HI> so I could only shake Hands and leave him.</P>
<P><HI>Friday, May</HI> 19. GOD still strengthening me more and more, I went this Morning to two little Villages, <HI>Hampstead</HI> and <HI>Highgate,</HI> about Five Miles off <HI>Savannah:</HI> The former consists of three▪ Fami∣lies, making in all eleven Souls, one Man a <HI>Jew;</HI> two Men, one Woman and seven Children <HI>Swissers.</HI> I was much delighted with seeing the Improvements
<PB N="7" REF="004855_0003_100E02B819CF0288"/>
a few pair of Hands had made in their respective Plantations, and was surprised to see what Indu∣stry will do. Surely they speak not Truth, who say that the <HI>Georgia</HI> People have been idle; for I never saw more laborious People than are in these Villages. They live exceeding hard, but with a little Assistance may do very well. I was at a Loss, because I could not talk <HI>French;</HI> but how∣ever I resolved, under GOD, to follow my worthy Predecessor's Example, and to visit them once a Week, and read Prayers to as many as could under∣stand me. I also enquired into the State of their Children, and found there were many who might prove useful Members of the Colony, if there was a proper Place provided for their Maintenance and Education. Nothing can effect this but an Orphan-House, which might easily be erected at <HI>Savannah,</HI> would some of those that are rich in this World's Good, contribute towards it. <HI>May GOD in his due Time, stir up the Wills of his faithful People, to be ready to distribute, and willing to communicate on this commendable Occasion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, May</HI> 20. Went once more to see <HI>Tomo Chachi,</HI> hearing his Nephew <HI>Tooanoowee</HI> was there, who could talk <HI>English.</HI> I desired him to enquire of his Uncle, Whether he thought he should die; who answered, He could not tell▪ I then asked, where he thought he should go after Death? He replied, to Heaven. <HI>But alas, how can a Drunkard enter there!</HI> I then exhorted <HI>Tooanoowee</HI> (who is a tall proper Youth) not to get drunk, telling him, he understood <HI>English,</HI> and therefore would be pun∣ished the more, if he did not live better. I then
<PB N="8" REF="004855_0004_100E02B9FA48E9E8"/>
asked him, Whether he believed a Heaven? He an∣swered, Yes. I then asked, Whether he believed a Hell? and described by pointing to the Fire; he replied, No, From whence we may easily gather how natural it is for all Mankind to believe there is a Place of Happiness, because they wish it may be so, and on the contrary, how averse they are to be∣lieve a Place of Torment, because they wish it may not be so. But GOD is true and just, and as sure∣ly as the Good shall go into everlasting Happiness, so the Wicked shall go into everlasting Punishment.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday, May</HI> 24. Went to Day to <HI>Thunderbolt,</HI> a Village about six Miles off <HI>Savannah,</HI> situated very pleasantly near the River, and consisting of three Families, four Men and two Women, and ten Ser∣vants; I was kindly received, expounded a Chap∣ter, used a few Collects, called on a Family or two that lay near our Way, and returned home to <HI>Sa∣vannah</HI> very comfortably, with my Friend <HI>Dela∣motte,</HI> about six o'Clock in the Evening. <HI>Blessed be GOD for strengthning my weak Body.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, June</HI> 2. This Evening parted with kind Captain <HI>Whiting,</HI> and my dear Friend <HI>Delamotte,</HI> who embarked for <HI>England</HI> about 7 at Night. The poor People lamented the Loss of him, and went to the Water-side to take a last Farewel. And good Reason had they to do so: For he has been inde∣fatigable in feeding <HI>Christ'</HI>s Lambs with the sincere Milk of the Word, and many of them (<HI>blessed be GOD</HI>) have grown thereby. Surely, I must labour most heartily, since I come after such worthy Pre∣decessors. The Good Mr. <HI>John Wesley</HI> has done in <HI>America,</HI> under GOD, is inexpressible. His
<PB N="9" REF="004855_0004_100E02B9FA48E9E8"/>
Name is very precious among the People; and he has laid such a Foundation, that I hope neither Men nor Devils will ever be able to shake. <HI>Oh, that I may follow him, as he has CHRIST.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, June</HI> 5. Had a Conference with a certain Person of the Parish, who, I heard last Night, had been broaching many heretical Doctrines to one of my Friends, particularly in denying the Eternity of Hell-Torments. I therefore invited him this Morning to Breakfast: and after imploring GOD's Assistance, in the Spirit of Meekness, I ask'd him, Whether he believed the Eternity of Hell-Tor∣ments? He answered frankly, No. I replied, What do you mean, Sir, when you repeat the twelfth Article of our Creed? He said, he believed wicked Men were to be annihilated. I then read <HI>Pearson'</HI>s Exposition of the last Article, but he denied it all, said he thought himself in the right, and believed it his Duty to inform Mankind, that they were to be annihilated. Upon which I repeat∣ed to him that Passage out of the <HI>Revelations,</HI> <Q>If any Man shall take away from, or add unto the Words that are written in this Book, GOD shall take away his Name out of the Book of Life, and add unto him all the Plagues that are written in this Book.</Q> This, he said, he be∣lieved. Afterwards we discoursed afresh, but find∣ing him resolute to propagate his Principles, I then told him with the utmost Calmness that I was sorry, that I gave him the Cup yesterday at the Sacra∣ment; but for the future, he must pardon me, if I refused ever to give it him again. This staggar∣ed him a little, but he bore it pretty patiently, yet
<PB N="10" REF="004855_0005_100E02BBC07CE0C0"/>
thought me uncharitable. But I told him I should meet him at the Judgment- Seat of <HI>Christ,</HI> and then he would see upon what Principles I acted. <HI>May GOD give me Grace not to regard the Faces of Men, but with an humble well guided Zeal and Cou∣rage to watch the Flock over which the Holy Ghost has made me Overseer.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, July</HI> 10. Placed one that came with me, at <HI>Highgate,</HI> to teach the Children <HI>English,</HI> that belong to that Village, and <HI>Hampstead.</HI> They are about twenty in all, of <HI>French</HI> Extraction, but some few of them are able to speak a little in our vulgar Tongue. I thought placing a Master there, would be of great Consequence, <HI>First,</HI> Because I cannot think Children will ever be naturalized to the Colony, till they can talk our Language. <HI>Se∣condly,</HI> Because the present Generation will soon wear off, and these Children being well instructed in ours, will make them forget their own Tongue, and should they marry and have Children, they would naturally teach their Children the same; so that at length we shall all be of one Speech. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> As they are but few in Number, and no likelihood of any <HI>French</HI> Minister to come amongst them; I or my Successors shall be unable to Cathe∣chise or bring them to hear the Word of GOD at our Church, unless they are acquainted with the <HI>English</HI> Tongue.</P>
<P><HI>Monday, June</HI> 11. Opened a School to Day for the Girls of <HI>Savannah,</HI> a Friend, whose Heart GOD was pleased to touch on Board the Ship, having at my Request undertaken to teach them. The Work is for my Master, &amp; therefore I doubt not
<PB N="11" REF="004855_0005_100E02BBC07CE0C0"/>
not of being supplied some Way or another with a sufficient Fund for the Support of it. <HI>May GOD enable him who is set over them to feed them with the sincere Milk of the Word, and give them Grace to grow thereby!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday, June</HI> 22. Was taken (as all about me thought for Death) with a violent Purging and Vomiting, which in the Space of five Hours quite exhausted my Spirits, and brought me in appear∣ance almost to the Point of Death. But GOD supported me by his inward Comforts, caused me to rejoice in it; and cast me into a deep Sleep, out of which I awoke perfectly well, to the Surprize of all about me. <HI>O who can express the loving Kind∣ness of the LORD▪ or shew forth all his Praise!</HI> My Parishioners in general shewed they loved me; for they seemed most follicitous for my Welfare. For their Sake, as well as for my own, I hope GOD <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so suddenly restored me. <HI>GOD grant I may now begin to be active in my Master's Service, that whensoever he shall call, I may be found so doing.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, June</HI> 24. To the great Surprise of my∣self and People, was enabled to read Prayers and preach with Power before the Free-Masons, with whom I afterwards dined, and was used with the utmost Civility. <HI>May GOD make them Servants of CHRIST, and then and not till then will they be free indeed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, July</HI> 7. Being the Anniversary for open∣ing the Court, I preached in the Morning at the Magistrate's Request, and endeavoured with all Plainness and Humility to shew both them and the People what they ought to do to promote their Tem∣poral
<PB N="12" REF="004855_0006_100E02BE0E42ECB8"/>
and Eternal Welfare. <HI>O GOD, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thou bless it, and it shall be blessed through JESUS CHRIST.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, July</HI> 11. Returned this Evening from <HI>Ebenezer</HI> (Whither I went Yesterday) the Place where the <HI>Saltzburghers</HI> are settled; and was won∣derfully pleased with their Order and Industry. Their Lands are improved surprisingly for the Time they have been there, and I believe they have far the best Crop of any in the Colony—They are blest with two such pious Ministers, as I have not often seen: The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have no Courts of Judicature, but all little Differences are immediately and implicitly decided by their Ministers, whom they look upon and love as their Fathers. They have likewise on Orphan-House, in which are seventeen Children, and one Widow, and I was much de∣lighted to see the Regularity wherewith it is manag∣ed. <HI>Oh that GOD may stir up the Hearts of his Servants to contribute towards that and another which we hope to have erected at</HI> Savannah—Mr. <HI>Boltzius,</HI> one of their Ministers, being with me on <HI>Saturday,</HI> I gave him some of my Poor's Store for his Orphans, and when I came to <HI>Ebenezer,</HI> he called them all before him, catechised and exhorted them to give GOD Thanks for his good Providence towards them; then prayed with them, and made them pray after him; then sung a Psalm, and afterwards the little Lambs came and shook me by the Hand one by one, and so we parted, and I scarce was ever better pleased in my Life—Surely, whoever contributes to the Relief of the <HI>Saltzburghers,</HI> will perform an acceptable Sacrifice to our Blessed Master, They are very poor; but with a little
<PB N="13" REF="004855_0006_100E02BE0E42ECB8"/>
Assistance might live Comfortably and well. They want a Place for Publick Worship, and Mo∣ney to buy Cattle, and other Necessaries for the Orphan-House and People. <HI>May the great GOD raise up Instruments to assist and relieve them; for surely they are worthy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, July</HI> 18. About ten o'Clock this Even∣ing returned to <HI>Savannah,</HI> having set out from thence Yesterday to visit four or five Families that live at some of the outward Settlements about twelve Miles off.—Their Beginnings as yet are but small, but I cannot help thinking there are Foundations laying for great temporal and spiritual Blessings in <HI>Georgia,</HI> when the Inhabitants are found worthy.—Blessed be GOD, in <HI>Savannah</HI> they will hear the Word gladly, and People every where receive me with the utmost Civility, and are not angry when I reprove them.—<HI>May GOD keep them always thus minded, and prepare me for whatever Sufferings he shall permit to fall upon me for doing my Duty.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, July</HI> 25. I am now waiting for the Scout-Boat which Mr. <HI>Hortan</HI> has sent to take me to <HI>Frederica,</HI> to preach the Gospel there also. For therefore am I sent.—I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould part with regret from the People of <HI>Savannah,</HI> did I not know GOD call'd me from them. For they seem to have a sincere Affection for me, and flock (especially every Even∣ing) to hear the Word of GOD.—I have endeav∣oured to let my Gentleness be known amongst them, because they consist of different Nations and Opin∣ions.—And I have strove to draw them by the Cords of Love, because the Obedience resulting from that Principle I take to be most genuine and
<PB N="14" REF="004855_0007_100E02BFA2E6A970"/>
lasting. My ordinary Way of dividing my Ministe∣rial Labours has been as follows,—</P>
<P>On <HI>Sunday</HI> Morning at five o'Clock, I publick∣ly expound the second Lesson for the Morning or Evening Service as I see most suited to the People's Edification; at ten I preach and read Prayers, at three in the Afternoon I do the same, and at seven expound Part of the <HI>Church Catechism,</HI> at which great Numbers are usually present. I visit from House to House, read publick Prayers, and expound twice, and catechize (unless something extraordina∣ry happens,) visit the Sick every Day, and read to as many of my Parishoners as will come thrice a Week.—And blessed be GOD my Labours have not been altogether vain in the LORD. For he has been pleased to set his Seal to my Ministry, in a Manner I could not, I dared not in <HI>America</HI> expect. <HI>Not unto me, O LORD, not unto me, but unto thy Name be the Glory.</HI></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>At FREDERICA.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Tuesday, August</HI> 8. After a pleasant Passage of five or six Days arrived at <HI>Frederica,</HI> a Town situated southwardly above an hundred Miles from <HI>Savannah</HI> and consisting of about an hundred and twenty In∣habitants. The People received me most gladly, having had a Famine of the Word for a long Sea∣son. <HI>May GOD give a Blessing to my coming amongst them.</HI></P>
<P>In the Evening we had publick Prayers, and ex∣pounding of the second Lesson under a large Tree, and many more present than could be expected. <HI>Blessed be GOD.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="004855_0007_100E02BFA2E6A970"/>
<HI>Wednesday, August</HI> 9. Began to Day visiting from House to House, and found the People in Appear∣ance desirous of being fed with the sincere <HI>Milk of the Word,</HI> and sollicitous for my Continuance a∣mongst them. Poor Creatures! my Heart ached for them, because I saw them and their Children scattered abroad as Sheep having no Shepherd. <HI>LORD, in thy due Time send forth some Labourer in∣to this Part of thy Vineyard.</HI></P>
<P>This Evening had Prayers in a House which Mr. <HI>Horton</HI> hired for us during my Stay, and most of the Inhabitants, I believe, were present. Blessed be GOD, Timber is sawing for the erecting a more commodious Place for publick Worship, 'till a Church can be built. <HI>GOD grant we may always worship him in Spirit and in Truth, and then we may be assured that at all Times and in all Places he will hear us.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, August</HI> 11. Went in the Morning to, and returned in the Evening from the <HI>Darien,</HI> a Settle∣ment about twenty Miles off from <HI>Frederica,</HI> whi∣ther I went to see Mr. <HI>Mac Leod,</HI> a worthy Minister of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Church, and GOD gave me a most plea∣sant Passage.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Aug.</HI> 12. This Afternoon was alarmed with the News of a Family Disaster. My dear Friend <HI>H'</HI>s Brother going to find a Horse that was lost in the Woods, was lost himself, and many Guns shot after him for several Days, but in vain. I endeavoured to give Thanks to GOD for this and every Thing that befalls me, because it is his Will, and resolved to set out for <HI>Savannah</HI> immediately, knowing what Concern my dear Friend <HI>H.</HI> must
<PB N="16" REF="004855_0008_100E02C1EF4E90B0"/>
be in at so sudden a Loss. <HI>Blessed be GOD for this and all Crosses. Father thy Will be done in, by, and upon me for Time and for Eternity.</HI></P>
<P>In the Evening, because I was to go about Mid∣night, I gave Notice I would preach as well as expound, at which almost all the Inhabitants were present; for many were obliged to stand without the Door. The Lesson was very applicable to my Cricumstances. It was the first of St. <HI>James</HI> wherein the Apostle bids us <HI>rejoice when we fall into divers Temptations.</HI> GOD enabled me to enlarge on it pretty much. I told the People that God called me and I must away, at which some wept. <HI>Oh GOD how dost thou follow me with thy Blessings wherever thou sendeth me! I looked for Persecution, but lo! I am received as an Angel of God. Not unto me, O LORD, not unto me, but unto thy Name be the Glory!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, August</HI> 13. Being disappointed of going by the Boat last Night, I read Prayers and preached to my dear little Flock twice, which caused great Joy among them. Mr. <HI>Horton</HI> was extreamly civil, and did every Thing he could to oblige me. This Afternoon after Sermon intended to go with him to preach to the Soldiers at the Fort of St. <HI>Simon'</HI>s, and then the next Day▪ to go to St. <HI>Andrew'</HI>s, <HI>but Lord thou callest me elsewhere. Oh grant I may have no Will of my own, but whenever or wherever thou shalt be pleased to call me, may I without the least Reluctance say, lo I come!</HI> Had an Alarm brought to <HI>Frederica</HI> that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had taken Possession of <HI>Fort</HI> St. <HI>George,</HI> and fired at one of our Boats: But this was quickly found to be entirely groundless.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="004855_0008_100E02C1EF4E90B0"/>
About 2 in the afternoon having first read Prayers, and preached, most of the Inhabitants recompanied me to the <HI>Bluff,</HI> and took their Leaves of me in an affectionate Manner, and laded me with Things convenient for my Journey. <HI>The good Lord reward them ten thousand sold, and make me thankful for his unmerited Mercies!</HI></P>

<HEAD>At SAVANNAH.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Wednesday, August</HI> 16. Arrived this Day at <HI>Sa∣vannah,</HI> and had the Pleasure of meeting my Friend who had been lost, he was from <HI>Tuesday</HI> till <HI>Friday</HI> roving about the Woods, during which Time the great Guns were fired according to Custom, and the People shewed what a great Respect they had for me and my Friends. Many of them going out all Day and Night after him.—Assoon as I had refreshed myself I went and visited my Parishioners from House to House to return them Thanks for their Kindness to my Friends. An unusual Joy appear'd in their Faces at my unexpected Return, and they were ready to say, <HI>How beautiful are the Feet of him that bringeth the glad Tidings of Salvation!</HI> At Evening Prayers (and a very large Congrega∣tion was present) I returned my dear Hearers hearty Thanks for the late Instance of their sincere Affection, I publickly exhorted my Friend that was lost to shew forth his Thankfulness not only with his Lips but with his Life, and desired their Prayers to GOD for me that I might now more and more devote myself to my Blessed Master's Service, and study daily to purify my corrupt Nature, that I might be made an Instrument under him of win∣ning their Souls to GOD.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="004855_0009_100E02C3AD120A48"/>
<HI>Wednesday, August</HI> 23. A Necessity was laid on me to Day to express my Resentment against In∣fidelity by refusing to read the Burial Office over the most professed Unbeliever I ever yet met with—GOD was pleased to visit him with a lingering Illness, in which Time I went to see him frequent∣ly.—Particularly about five Weeks ago, I asked him what Religion he was of, he answered, <Q>Re∣ligion was divided into so many Sects he knew not which to chuse.</Q>—Another Time, I offered to pray with him, but he would not accept it, upon which I resolv'd to go see him no more;—But being told two Days before he died, that he had an Inclination to see me, I went to him again, and after a little Conversation I put to him the following Questions, "Do you believe JESUS CHRIST to be GOD, the one Mediator between GOD and Man?" He said, "I believe CHRIST was a good Man."—<Q>Do you believe the Holy Scriptures? I believe, replied he, something of the Old-Testament, the New I do not believe at all. - Do you believe, Sir, a Judgment to come? he turned himself about, and replied, I know not what to say to that.—Alas, said I, Sir, if all these Things should be true—</Q> which Words, I believe gave him Concern, for he seemed after to be very uneasy, grew delirious, and departed in a Day or two.—Unhappy Man, how quickly was he convinced that all I said was true. Now he and I are of one Mind: The Day after his Decease he was carried to the Ground, and I refused to read the Office over him, but went to the Grave and told the People what had passed between him and
<PB N="19" REF="004855_0009_100E02C3AD120A48"/>
me, warned them against Infidelity, and asked them whether I could safely say, "as our Hope is this our Brother doth." upon which I believe they were thoroughly satisfied that I had done right.—<HI>GOD grant this may be a Warning to surviving Unbeliever's.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday, August</HI> 24. This Day went to <HI>Highgate</HI> with a Friend or two more, and read Prayers, prea∣ched and baptiz'd a Child, and catechised in a House lately erected by the Inhabitants. For upon my send∣ing a Master to teach their Children, one offered to give me a Part of his Lot, and the rest to give their Labour. Accordingly I accepted of it, found Ma∣terials, and to Day it was fit to preach in, and be made a School-House. The Children tho' Foreigners, answer'd admirable well, which gave me great Hopes that the other Foreign Children of the Colony may also learn our <HI>English</HI> Tongue when a proper Master is provided.—After Service we refreshed ourselves toge∣ther, thanked our Good GOD, and eat our Bread with Gladness of Heart.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, August</HI> 27. GOD having now shewn both me and my Friends that it was his Will I should return for a while to <HI>England:</HI> This After∣noon I preached my Farewel Sermon, to the great Grief of my dear Parishioners, for their Hearts I found were very full as well as mine, which they expressed by shedding many Tears. But a sensible Alteration appear'd in their Countenances, when I promised them solemnly before GOD to return as soon as possible. <HI>May GOD enable me to perform my Promise, and prepare my Way before me.</HI></P>
<P>The Weather was exceeding hot, and the Great∣ness of the Congregation made it still hotter, but
<PB N="20" REF="004855_0010_100E02C6101F49F0"/>
God enabled me to preach with Power. <HI>Thanks be to GOD for the Strength he gives thro'</HI> JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P><HI>Monday, August</HI> 28. This being the Day of my Departure, it was mostly spent in taking Leave of my Flock, who expressed their Affection now more than ever. For they came to me from the Morn∣ing to the Time I left them with Tears in their Eyes, wishing me a prosperous Voyage and safe Re∣turn, and gave me other Tokens of their Love. For they brought me Wine, Ale, Cake, Coffee, Tea, and other Things proper for my Passage, and their Love seemed without Dissimulation.</P>
<P>About Four in the Afternoon I went into the Boat provided for me by Mr. <HI>Causlon,</HI> who with the Recorder came to my House and took their Leave. A great Number of People came to the <HI>Bluff</HI> and wish'd me a good Voyage with all their Souls, and a speedy Return; I thanked them, and having de∣sired their Prayers, blessed them in the Name of GOD, and took my Leave.</P>
<P>My Heart was full, and I took the first Opportu∣nity of venting of it by Prayers &amp; Tears. I think I never parted from a Place with more Regret; for <HI>America</HI> in my Opinion is an excellent School to learn CHRIST in; and I have great Hopes some good will come out of <HI>Savannah,</HI> because the longer I continued there, the larger the Congregations grew. And I scarce knew a Night, tho' we had Divine Service twice a Day, when the Church-House has not been near full—A Proof, this, I hope, that GOD has yet Spiritual and Temporal Blessings in store for them. <HI>Hasten, O LORD, that blessed Time!</HI></P>

<P>Arrived last Night here, and preached twice to
<PB N="21" REF="004855_0010_100E02C6101F49F0"/>
Day, I hope with some good Effect. The Bishop of <HI>London'</HI>s Commissary, the Rev. Mr. <HI>Garden,</HI> a good Soldier of JESUS CHRIST, received me in a most Christian Manner. He and several others offered me a Lodging, and were more than civil to me. <HI>How does God raise me up Friends wherever I go! Who is so good a GOD as our GOD?</HI></P>
<P>Was much pleased with the Neatness of the Build∣ings, and the Largeness of the Place. The Church is very beautiful, and the Inhabitants seemed to be excellently well setled. <HI>GOD's Judgments have been late abroad amongst them by the spreading of the</HI> Small Pox, <HI>I hope they will learn Righteousness!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, Sept.</HI> 4. Was much delighted with a Packet of Letters I received from <HI>Savannah,</HI> not only as they were a Proof of the Writer's Affection for me, but also that the Holy Ghost was effectually moving on their Souls.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Sept.</HI> 9. Receiv'd another comfort∣able Packet of Letters from <HI>Savannah</HI> Friends, and was soon hurried on Board, the Wind being fair for Sailing. Great Kindness has been shewn me at <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> some Presents made me, and there was a general &amp; earnest Expectation of my Preach∣ing on Sunday. <HI>But GOD seeth not as Man seeth. Father, thy Will be done!</HI></P>
<P><HI>On Board the</HI> Mary, <HI>Captain</HI> Coc, <HI>Commander, bound from</HI> Charles-Town <HI>to</HI> England.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Sept.</HI> 9. About Noon came on Board with great Composure of Mind, and thought of my absent Friends, settled my Things, wrote my Jour∣nal, and finished some other Matters. The Wind being fair weighed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> set sail about five
<PB N="22" REF="004855_0011_100E02C89751AE48"/>
in the Evening. <HI>The Lord send us a prosperous Voyage, and bring us in his appointed Time to the Haven where we would be!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Sept.</HI> 16. Had contrary Winds all the Week, and got but a few Leagues from <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> yet GOD shewed me great Mercies: For he enabled me to write several Things, and correct others. I have been but a little Sea-sick; and though I have not had my Cloaths off, and lay upon Deck or on a Chest every Night, yet the Goodness of GOD keeps me healthy and strong, and gives me a feeling Possession of, his Holy Spirit. My Sphere of Action is now contracted into a very narrow Compass. There are but few Souls on Board, and all that I can do is to read publick Pray∣ers, and add a Word of Exhortation twice every Day, and catechise those I brought with me. The Captain and all are very civil, my Christian Friends have been much upon my Heart, and caused me some Dejections, but GOD was my Comforter. Had I my own Will, I could wish myself a speedy Passage, that I may return the sooner to those few Sheep I have left at <HI>Savannah;</HI> but GOD knows best, and this Retirement, I hope, will break my Will, purify my Heart, and fit me for the great Work that lies before me. <HI>Even so</HI> LORD JESUS, <HI>Amen,</HI> and <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Sept.</HI> 23. Still GOD is pleased to send us contrary Winds, except one Night about the Middle of the Week.—However, he enables me to give Thanks—and great Reason have I so to do—<HI>For the Holy Spirit has been with me of a Truth!</HI></P>
<P>I have observed, that before GOD calls me to a
<PB N="23" REF="004855_0011_100E02C89751AE48"/>
publick Work, he always sends me into some Re∣tirement, but never to so great a one as now.—A Sign this, I hope, that a greater Work is yet be∣hind. <HI>Lord, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it and prepare me for it!</HI></P>
<P>My Mind blessed be GOD, has been composed and easy. Only the Absence of my Friends, now and then struck a Damp upon my Spirits.—But the Friend of all is with and in me, and he by his Spirit, I trust, will supply the Want of their dear Company.—<HI>Amen, LORD JESUS, Amen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday,</HI> 24. <HI>Monday Sept.</HI> 25. Was oppressed much in Spirit these two Days. The Wind was contrary and the Sea wrought, and was tempestu∣ous; but blessed be GOD, he enabled me to be re∣signed to his Will, this outward and inward Trial being only what was to be expected after my late Assistances. <HI>We must not always be upon the Mount in this Life.</HI></P>
<P>Ever since <HI>Monday</HI> Evening, GOD has been pleased to send us fair Winds, particularly to Day, when our Ship has sail'd seven Miles an Hour, <HI>Blessed be GOD.</HI></P>
<P>I have been chiefly busied about writing Letters, to engage more Labourers, and to get Contributi∣ons for my poor Flock.</P>
<P>Blessed be GOD! he has made me frequently rejoice in Spirit, and now quite reconciles me to my present Retirement. <HI>When shall I have no Will but GOD's!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, Octob.</HI> 1. Had very little Sleep all Night, and was like to fall of the Chest whereon I lay se∣veral Times, the Sea being very rough, and the Wind turning in an Instant directly contrary. <HI>Oh
<PB N="24" REF="004855_0012_100E02CACCF84448"/>
that I could learn from Winds and Storms to obey my Master!</HI></P>
<P>Buried a young Man that came from <HI>Georgia,</HI> and died this Morning. LORD, what is Man? He solaced himself with the Tho'ts of seeing his Friends in <HI>England.</HI> But GOD saw fit to prevent it by short∣ning his Days. <HI>LORD, thy Judgments are like the great Deep!</HI></P>
<P>When I buried him, I could not say much, be∣cause of the rowling of the Ship; but at Evening-Prayer I took occasion from the Lesson (which pro∣videntially was the 15th <HI>Chap.</HI> of the first of <HI>Corin∣thians</HI>) to exhort all my Ship-mates to consider so, as to prepare for their latter End. I believe my Words came with Power. <HI>GOD grant they may have a due Effect. Amen,</HI> LORD JESUS, <HI>Amen!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, Octob.</HI> 6. Before I left <HI>Savannah,</HI> the Les∣son appointed for the Morning, was St. <HI>Paul'</HI>s Ship∣wreck, out of the <HI>Acts,</HI> and before I left <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> the Lesson was the First of <HI>Jonah,</HI> both which made such a deep Impression upon me, that I wrote to my Friend <HI>Habersham,</HI> to acquaint him I was ap∣prehensive we should have a dangerous Voyage: Since I have been on Board, what St. <HI>Paul</HI> said to his Companions, <Q>That he perceived their Voy∣age would be to their great Damage,</Q> has fre∣quently been press'd upon my Heart; and GOD has now shewn me wherefore he gave these previous Notices. For on <HI>Tuesday</HI> Night last, after we had sailed 150 Miles, the last twenty Hours, about e∣leven o'Clock arose a sudden violent <HI>East</HI> Wind, which continued till about Four in the Morning, and put all the Sailors to their Wits End.—Most
<PB N="25" REF="004855_0012_100E02CACCF84448"/>
of them declared they never had seen the like be∣fore. The main Sail was slit in several Pieces, and several of the other Sails, and much of the Tack∣ling all to Tatters; not a dry Place was to be found in all the Ship: The Captain's Hammock, in the great Cabbin, was half filled with Water; and though I lay in the most dry Part of the Ship, yet the Waves broke in upon me twice or thrice. In short all was Terror and Confusion, Men's Hearts failing them for Fear, and the Wind and the Sea raging most horribly. But GOD (<HI>for ever be adored his unmerited Goodness</HI>) was exceeding gracious unto me. For I felt a sweet Complacency in my Will, in Submission to his. Many particular Promises GOD has made me from his Word, that I should return in Peace, flowed in upon my Heart. And he enabled me greatly to rejoice.—This is the first Day we have ven∣tured to pull down any of our dead Lights, which put me in Mind of the long Night the <HI>Egyptians</HI> once saw. But I spent my Time in reading, and fervent Intercession for absent Friends, and com∣forted my self much with the Remembrance of them; most of our fresh Provisions are washed o∣ver Board, and our Tackling much out of Order, so that we have a Prospect of but an indifferent Voyage. But blessed be GOD, the Prospect pleases me. For now I shall learn, I trust, how to want as well as how to abound, and how to endure Hardship like a good Soldier of JESUS CHRIST. <HI>O Lord, let thy Strength be magnified in my Weak∣ness, say unto my Soul, <Q>It is I, be not afraid, and then let Storms and Tempests do their worst.</Q></HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="004855_0013_100E02CD2C94B840"/>
<HI>Saturday, Octob.</HI> 7. This has been a Week, bles∣sed be GOD, though not of much Action, yet full of Opportunities of exercising my passive Gra∣ces! To Day, adored be the Divine Goodness, the Weather has cleared up more and more, and our Ship has sailed directly before the Wind, at the Rate of four or five Miles an Hour.</P>
<P>A Desire to see my Friends in <HI>England,</HI> to dis∣patch my Business, and to return to my poor Flock, prompt me secretly to wish for a Continuance of this prosperous Gale. <HI>But LORD I know not what to pray for as I ought. Do with me as seemeth good in thy Sight. Only I beseech thee to sanctify my pre∣sent Retirement; that the longer I am upon the Sea, the more zealous I may be in thy Service, when I come upon dry Land.</HI></P>
<P>Saw a <HI>Jamaica</HI> Ship, Captain <HI>Phillips,</HI> who has been out nine Weeks, <HI>What Reason have we to be thankful!</HI></P>
<P>Having had no Opportunity before, since the Storm, of getting many of our People together, gave a Word or two of Exhortation to my Ship∣mates, to bless GOD for our late Deliverance, and to sin no more least a worse Storm should befal us.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, October</HI> 14. Sailed this Week about 600 Miles; but Yesterday GOD was pleased to send us a contrary Wind, which still continues. <HI>Father, thy Will be done.</HI></P>
<P>A few Days ago I flattered myself we should be soon at our desired Port, but GOD is pleased to de∣fer the Accomplishment of my Hopes: However, <HI>blessed be his Name, He enables me to give Thanks.</HI></P>
<P>Most of this Week has been spent in searching
<PB N="27" REF="004855_0013_100E02CD2C94B840"/>
the Scriptures; and particular Retirements for Di∣rection and Assistance in the Work before me.—GOD has been pleased to send me many inward Tri∣als. And now my fresh Provisions are gone, and the People are put to the Allowance of a Quart of Water each Man for a Day. So that I hope now the Spiritual Man will grow, having so little for the natural Man to feed on. <HI>Amen, LORD JESUS.</HI>—Blessed be GOD I can by his Grace say that I rejoice in Necessities, and do in every Thing give Thanks. <HI>Keep me thus minded, O Dear Redeemer, till thou perfect thy Work in my Soul.</HI></P>
<P>Had this Sentence out of <HI>Henry</HI> much pressed up∣on my Heart to comfort me in my Retirement;—<HI>The Mower loses no Time whilst he is whetting his Scythe.</HI>—Thus shall all <HI>Christians</HI> be taught of GOD.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, October</HI> 15. The Weather being calm, and I being kindly invited Yesterday, went on board the <HI>Constant,</HI> Captain <HI>Philips</HI> bound from <HI>Jamaica,</HI> who now sails in Company with us, and was kind∣ly received both by the Captain and his Passengers, and not only so▪ but they spared me what they could of their Provisions. A most providential Supply; for ours was quite out. But our Extremity is GOD's Opportunity. <HI>Blessed be his Name for thus strengthning our Faith. May this be looked upon as a Pledge that he will never leave or for sake us.</HI></P>
<P>Our chief Discourse was about <HI>Georgia;</HI> and stay∣ing a little longer than was thought, my Shipmates were very suspicious I should be detained on board. But tho' their was Provision for the Flesh, yet I like my own Situation best, because here are greater
<PB N="28" REF="004855_0014_100E02CF4043DB18"/>
Opportunities of denying myself, and consequently of making farther Improvement in the Spirit. <HI>Oh that I may always walk by this Rule!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, October</HI> 21. Made but slow Advances in our Voyage, having had but one or two Days of fair Wind. But notwithstanding, I believe we shall now soon reach Shore; for GOD has been pleased to visit me all the Week with Variety of inward Trials, which is a Sign to me that I shall experience yet more and more of his Mercies. <HI>How good is GOD thus to prepare me by Sufferings, that so his Blessings may not he my Ruin; these Things to the natural Man are not joious, but grievous; but GOD enables me to take Com∣fort only in him, to thank him sincerely for his loving Correction, and therefore when I am sufficiently exer∣cised thereby, I hope it will bring forth in me the peace∣able Fruits of Righteousness.</HI> Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, Octob.</HI> 22. At the Desire of the Captain preach'd my Sermon on rash Anger, having hitherto used to expound only. In the Lesson were these re∣markable Words, <HI>Return to thy own House, and show how great Things God has done unto thee.</HI> And again, <HI>It came to pass that when Jesus was returned, the People gladly received him, for they were all waiting for him.</HI> These last Words were remarka∣bly pressed upon me at <HI>Savannah,</HI> when I was con∣sulting GOD by Prayer, whether it was his Will that I should go to <HI>England. Thus GOD's Word is in particular Cases as well as in general, a Light unto our Feet, and a Lanthorn unto our Paths.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday, October</HI> 25. Was much comforted this Evening in reading the 33<SUP>d</SUP> &amp; 34th Chapters of <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> wherein I could not but observe many
<PB N="29" REF="004855_0014_100E02CF4043DB18"/>
Circumstances of GOD's dealing with him corres∣ponding with what I have experienced in myself: The following Verses in particular were set home to my Heart,—<HI>Also thou Son of Man, the Chil∣dren of thy People are still talking against thee by the Wall and in the Doors of the House, and speak one to another, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what Word cometh from the LORD.</HI>—<HI>And they came unto thee as the People cometh, and they hear thy Words, but they will not do them, for with their Mouth they shew much Love, but their Heart goeth after Covetousness. And lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely Song of one that hath a pleasant Voice, and can play well on an Instrument: For they hear thy Words, but do them not.</HI>—Who that knows how GOD has dealt with me since I have been in the Ministry, sees not that this Passage answers to my Circumstances, as Face answers to Face in the Water? However, this I know, what I have spo∣ken from GOD will come to pass (lo it will come) and then shall these Scoffers and Despisers know, that a Minister of CHRIST has been amongst them. <HI>O that I may never be brought forth as a swift Witness against any; but we must all appear before the Judgment Seat of</HI> CHRIST.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, October</HI> 28. Sailed about 300 Miles the four first Days of this Week: Had a little Storm on <HI>Wednesday</HI> Night, and a great Calm ever since. We are now within 150 Leagues of Land, and our Provisions and Water very scanty, and our Ship very weak; but the Hour of our Arrival is not yet come. <HI>Lord, Teach me to be resigned and thankful, and then deal with me as seemeth good in thy Sight.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="004855_0015_100E02D1978967E8"/>
Blessed be God! he has this Week enlarged my Heart, and filled me with great Comfort, after great inward Conflicts. Is not all this to prepare me for further Trials we are yet to endure e're we get to <HI>England? LORD, thy Grace I know will be sufficient for me, and therefore I rejoice in the Prospect of enduring Tribulation.</HI></P>
<P>Had Reason to believe one on board was offended at my enlarging one Night on the Sin of <HI>Drunken∣ness.</HI>—I always endeavour to speak with the Meek∣ness and Gentleness of CHRIST.—But if People will account me their Enemy, because out of Love I tell them the Truth, I cannot help that. <HI>Lo, I have delivered my Soul.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, October</HI> 30. Still GOD is pleased that the Wind, what there is of it, should be contrary, and our Ship's Company are now brought into great Streights. Their Allowance of Water is a Quart a Day, and our constant Food for some Time has been on Salt Beef and Water Dumplins, which do not agree with the Stomachs of some amongst us. But GOD enables me to rejoice in that and all other our Necessities, yea, He so comforts me that many I believe are surprised at my Chearfulness. But when we are destitute of outward Comforts, then does GOD more comfort our Souls. This Morning when I awoke, the Faith of <HI>Abraham</HI> was greatly pressed upon me; and the Example of <HI>Daniel,</HI> and the three Children, who were fat and well favoured, notwithstanding they were fed with Pulse and Pease, is continually before my Eyes. Some say we are within a hundred Leagues of Land. But what does that signify, if GOD says, <HI>Hitherto shall you go, and
<PB N="31" REF="004855_0015_100E02D1978967E8"/>
no further. LORD, in thy due Time, let that which now letteth be taken away, but not before this Trial has done what it was sent for, tho' it make us smart.</HI></P>
<P>I warm myself by smiling on, and exhorting them, and this Afternoon we joined in solemn Prayers suitable to our present Circumstances. <HI>LORD, let our Cry come unto Thee.</HI> I know it will, and that we shall be answer'd, if it be best. But great Bles∣sings await me on Shore, and great Trials must pre∣cede. <HI>Oh that I may by these small, be prepared for greater Sufferings. Amen, LORD JESUS.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, October</HI> 30. Was comforted to-Night in my present Circumstances, by these Verses out of this Evening's Lesson.—<HI>I have learnt in whatsoever State I am, therewith to be content. I know both how to be abased, and how to abound; every where, and in all Things I am instructed, both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer Need. I can do all thro'</HI> CHRIST <HI>which strengthneth me. Even so come,</HI> LORD JESUS. Amen <HI>and</HI> Amen.</P>
<P>Reading afterwards in the Book of <HI>Maccabeus,</HI> and thinking of my present Situation, this Verse was pressed with unspeakable Comfort upon my Soul. <Q>After this, they went Home, and sung a Song of Thanksgiving, and praised the LORD in Heaven; <HI>Because it is good, because his Mer∣cy endureth for ever.</HI></Q> I hope my Friends will take care to fulfil this when we meet together on Shore.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday, Nov.</HI> 1. This Afternoon, about 4 o'Clock, as I was in Secret, humbling my Soul be∣fore GOD, interceeding for my Friends, &amp; had been praying for a fair Wind, &amp; Assistance in the great
<PB N="32" REF="004855_0016_100E02D3BB97D048"/>
Work lying before me, News was brought that the Wind was fair; which put me in Mind of the Angel's being sent to <HI>Daniel,</HI> to tell him his Prayer was heard, when he was humbling his Soul with Fasting, and praying for the Peace and Re∣stauration of <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> Indeed I cannot say, I have purposely, for these three Weeks, eat no pleasant Food, or fasted, as he did; but our Food is so salt, that I dare eat but little, so that I am now literally in Fastings often. <HI>Oh! that I may improve this blessed Season for Humiliation, and ex∣traordinary▪ Acts of Devotion, that I may be duly prepared to approve myself a faithful Minister of</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>whether by Honour or Dishonour, by evil Report or good Report.</HI></P>
<P>As soon as we found the Wind fair, we joined in Thanksgiving, and in singing the first Part of the 34th <HI>Psalm,</HI> (new Version) which was very applicable to our Circumstances. For they tell me they have not above three Days Water on Board, allowing a Quart to each Man a Day. But he, that at one Time, at the Request of his Disciples, considered the Multitude, and worked a Miracle for their Relief; and, at another Time, at the Intercession of <HI>Moses,</HI> gave Water to the wandering <HI>Israelites,</HI> I trust, now, has heard our Prayers, and sent this Wind with a Commission to bring us where he will supply all our Wants, <HI>If not, O blessed</HI> JESU, <HI>thy Will be done. Give me Grace, I most humbly beseech thee, to hold out my three Watches, and at the fourth Watch I know thou wilt come. Even so come</HI> LORD JESUS.</P>
<P><HI>Thursday, November</HI> 4. For these two Days last
<PB N="33" REF="004855_0016_100E02D3BB97D048"/>
past, GOD has been pleased greatly to humble my Soul, and bring me low by spiritual Desertions. And to-Day he has thought proper again to send us a contrary Wind, bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>d be his Name. Ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Allowance of Water no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but a Pint a Day, so that we dare not eat much Beef. Our Sails are exceeding thin, some more of them were split last Night, and no one knows where we are; but GOD does, and that is sufficient.</P>
<P>Last Night he lifted up the Light of his blessed Countenance upon me, and to Day fills me with Joy unspeakable, and full of Glory; so that though I have little to eat, yet I inwardly possess all Things. I am sometime afraid lest continued Abstinence may occasion a bodily Sickness. But wherefore do I fear? If it does, that and every Thing else I know will work for my Good.—What I most dread, is lest any on Board should charge GOD foolishly; but I check the first Motions I discern arising in any one's Heart, and endeavour to justify our good GOD, in all the Evil that he hath brought upon us. I put before them the Example of the Widow of <HI>Sarepta,</HI> and caution them against mur∣muring like the <HI>Israelites</HI> at the Waters of <HI>Meri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ah. And thus I endeavour to comfort and support them with the Comforts wherewith I myself am comforted of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>This is now the eighth Week I have been Aboard. If my Friends ask me, why I arrived no sooner, I may truly answer, <HI>Satan</HI> hindered us. For I believe it is he who is permitted to do this; but this still gives me greater Hopes, that a more effectual Door than ever, will be opened in <HI>England,</HI> for
<PB N="34" REF="004855_0017_100E02D630C64848"/>
preaching the everlasting Gospel. <HI>O Satan, Satan, I defy thee to do thy worst; thou mayest toss me up and down, and bring me into Jeopardy on evey Side; but Jesus Christ is praying for me on the Mount. And when the Time appointed by the Father is come, and my Soul hereby prepared, he whom Winds and Storms obey, will speak the Word; and then I shall have a happy Meeting with my dear Friends!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, November</HI> 5. This Day we rejoiced with trembling. For though we thereon commemorated our Deliverance from the <HI>Gunpowder-Plot,</HI> yet as our Circumstances called for Acts of Humiliation, I used Part of the Office of Commination, (besides solemn Prayer and Psalms three Times) and enlarg∣ed on these Words of St. <HI>James,</HI> <Q>My Brethren, count it all Joy, when ye fall into divers Temp∣tations; knowing this, that the trying of your Faith worketh Patience: But let Patience have her perfect Work.</Q> I hope this had a good Effect upon my Hearers Hearts, and calmed their Spirits. For indeed we are brought very low: But I can say with the penitent Thief, <Q>That I suffer justly, and do not receive the ten thousandth Part of the Reward due to my Crimes.</Q> <HI>Lord, remember me now thou art in thy Kingdom!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, November</HI> 6. Last Night, about seven o'Clock, GOD was pleased to suffer a violent Wind to arise, which would not permit me to rise till this Afternoon, about which Time it began in some Measure to abate▪ Blessed be GOD, through the Precaution used by our Ship-Mates, we ship'd but little Water, only we were driven some Leagues back. The Weather was pretty cold, and a little
<PB N="35" REF="004855_0017_100E02D630C64848"/>
Cake or two baked on the Coals, and a very little Salt-Beef was all my Provision for the Day; but thus <HI>Elijah</HI> lived for a long while, and why not I? Nay, he fasted forty Days and forty Nights. And though I dare not presume to do so, yet if GOD still brings me into greater Wants, I doubt not, but I shall find that Man liveth not by Bread alone, but by every Word that proceedeth out of the Mouth of GOD. <HI>Lord, I desire not to be exempted from suffering, but to be supported under them. If thy Glory can be promoted by my Trials, lo, here I am, scourge me, try me as it seemeth good in thy Sight!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wednesday, November</HI> 8. Preached myself, Yester∣day and this Morning, inwardly weak and fainting, and unable to read scarce any Thing. <HI>But, blessed be God! though he kill me, yet will I put my Trust in him.</HI></P>
<P>When my Spirits are gone, I then find my Faith, as it were, less lively: But I trust that is only ow∣ing to the Frame of my Body. For at all other Times I have great Confidence in GOD! And was he now to put it to my Choice, whether this Trial should continue, or he should send us a fair Wind, I should humbly refer it to him again. <HI>For I know not what is best for me!</HI></P>
<P>Most in the great Cabin now begin to be weak, and look hollow Ey'd, yet a little while, and we shall come to Extremities; and then GOD's Arm will bring us Salvation. <HI>May we patiently tarry the LORD's Leisure!</HI> Amen, Amen.</P>
<P>Great Part of this Day I lay down, being weak and much oppressed in my Head; but at Night when some doubted what the End of this Visitation would be, the following Verses were with great
<PB N="36" REF="004855_0018_100E02D9431736C8"/>
Comfort pressed upon my Soul. <Q>For I am in a strait between two, having a Desire to be dissolved, and to be with CHRIST, which is far better. Nevertheless to abide in the Flesh is more need∣ful for you. And having this Confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all, for your Furtherance and Joy of Faith: That your rejoicing may be more abundant in JESUS CHRIST for me, by my coming to you again.</Q> <HI>Thus Christians have Meat to eat, which the World knoweth not.</HI></P>
<P>In confidence of this, and such like Texts, that have been from Time to Time applied to my Soul, I still, (as often as my Strength will permit) con∣tinue to write Letters ready to send when I come on Shore. Which reminds me of <HI>Jeremiah'</HI>s being commanded to buy Land, when his whole Country was about to be carried into Captivity. <HI>Blessed are they that walk by Faith, and not by Sight!</HI></P>
<P>Though one in his Haste the other Day cried out, "What <HI>Jonah</HI> have we on Board?" And I an∣swer'd, I am he; yet many now, I believe, bless GOD, that I am with them. For, say they, <Q>How should we have been blaming and cursing one and other, had not Mr. <HI>W</HI>—<HI>d</HI> been amongst us?</Q> <HI>Blessed be God, if my Ministry or Presence can be in∣strumental to prevent Sin against thee, O Lord, toss me on the Ocean as long as it pleaseth thee! O my dear Lord, I desire to be resigned!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday, November</HI> 9. Enjoyed great Peace of Mind to Day, and was stronger in Body than usual. <HI>Blessed be the Lord!</HI> We are now making for <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> and are advanced some Leagues towards it.
<PB N="37" REF="004855_0018_100E02D9431736C8"/>
Whether we shall arrive there or not, GOD only knows. I find all Uneasiness arises from having a Will of my own. And therefore I simply desire to will what GOD willeth. <HI>Oh! when will this once be?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, November</HI> 10. Was much strengthened in our present Distress by the second Lesson for the Day. It was our Saviour's turning the Water into Wine at the Marriage of <HI>Canaan.</HI> We have appli∣ed to him as the Holy Virgin did, and told him in Prayer, that, "We have but very little Water?" At present, he seems to turn away his Face, and to say, "What have I to do with you?" But this is only because the Hour of Extremity is not yet come. When it is▪ I doubt not but he will now as richly supply our Wants, as he did theirs then. <HI>May we in Patience possess our Souls!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, November</HI> 11. Still we are floating about, not knowing where we are. But our People seem yet to have Hopes of seeing <HI>Ireland.</HI> I know not whether I am out in my Conjecture, but I imagine some of those Ships we have seen, are arrived at <HI>England</HI> before us. Upon which, perhaps, my Friends will expect me, pray for me, and at last give me up for lost. <HI>And then God will restore me to them.</HI></P>
<P>The Weather now begins to be cold, so that I can say, with the Apostle, <HI>I am in Hungrings and Thirstings▪ Cold and Fastings often.</HI> Hereafter, per∣haps, I may add <HI>moreover in Bonds and Imprisonments.</HI> But I trust the Sufferings of this Life will not move me. <HI>For they are not worthy to be compared with the Glory that shall be revealed in us.</HI></P>
<P>My outward Man sensibly decayeth, but the
<PB N="38" REF="004855_0019_100E02DB50FCC140"/>
Spiritual Man, I trust, is renewed Day by Day. I have besought the LORD many times to send us a fair Wind: But now I see he does not think fit to answer me. I am wholly resigned, knowing that his Grace will be sufficient for me, and that his Time is best.</P>
<P>Our Ship is much out of repair, and our Food by no means, enough to support Nature in an ordi∣nary Way, and that of the most indifferent Kind too: An Ounce or two of Salt-Beef, a Pint of Water, and a Cake made of Flower and Skimmings of the Pot. But I think often on him who preserv∣ed <HI>Moses</HI> in the Ark of <HI>Bulrushes.</HI> And so long as I look upwards my Faith will not fail.</P>
<P>Blessed be GOD for these Things, I rejoice in them daily. They are no more than what I expect∣ed, and I know they are Preparatives for future Mercies. <HI>GOD of his infinite Mercy humble and try me, till I am rightly disposed to receive them. Amen.</HI> LORD JESUS. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>It pities me often to see my Brethren, lying in the Dust, as they have done these many Weeks and exposed to such Streights: For GOD knows both their Souls and Bodies are dear unto me. But thanks be to GOD they bear up well, and I hope we shall all now learn to endure Hardships, like good Soldiers of JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday Nov.</HI> 12. This Morning the Doctor of our Ship took up the <HI>Common-Prayer Book,</HI> and observed that he opened upon these Words, <HI>Blessed be the LORD GOD of</HI> Israel, <HI>for he hath visited and redeemed his People.</HI> And so indeed he has, for about 8 o'Clock this Morning News were brought,
<PB N="39" REF="004855_0019_100E02DB50FCC140"/>
that our Men saw Land, and I went and was a joyful Spectator of it myself. The Air was clear, and the Sun arising in full Strength, so that 'tis the most pleasant Day I have seen these many Weeks. <HI>Now know</HI> I <HI>that the LORD will not always be chiding, neither keepeth he his Anger forever.</HI> For these two or three Days last past, I have enjoyed uncommon Serenity of Soul, and given up my Will to GOD. And now he hath brought us Deliver∣ance.—From whence I infer, that a Calmness of Mind, and entire Resignation to the Divine Will, is the best Preparative for receiving Divine Mercies. <HI>LORD evermore make me thus minded!</HI></P>
<P>As soon as I had taken a View of the Land, we joined together in a Prayer and Psalm of Thanksgi∣ving, and already began to reflect with Pleasure on our late Streights. Thus it will be hereafter, the Storms and Tempests of this troublesome World will serve to render our Haven of eternal Rest dou∣bly agreeable.—I fear now nothing so much as the Treachery of my Heart, lest like the ungrateful Lepers, I should not turn to GOD and give Thanks by leading a Holy Life. <HI>But all Things are possible with GOD, on whose rich Mercies and free Grace in</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>I alone depend for Wisdom, Righ∣teousness, Sanctification and Redemption!</HI></P>
<P>Spent a good Part of this Afternoon in walking upon Deck, and blessing GOD for the Prospect I saw all around me. His good Providence has been plea∣sed to bring us into a fine large Bay, surrounded on each Side with high Lands and Hommocks, much like those near <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> and a large Light-House on the Fore-Land, from which in the Evening was
<PB N="40" REF="004855_0020_100E02DD52D57CC8"/>
shewn a Light. It lies on North-West of <HI>Ireland</HI> and most suppose we are near <HI>Limerick,</HI> but are not certain, only one of our Men having been here before. There are no Soundings till you come very near the Land. The Wind being against us (that little that was of it) we could not get much forward: <HI>But GOD in his due Time will bring us on shore.</HI> Blessed be his Name, the Weather is exceeding clear, and this is the most comfortable Day I have seen along Time. <HI>LORD make me mindful of these thy Mer∣cies all the Days of my Life!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, Nov.</HI> 14. Let this Day, my Soul, be noted in thy Book, for GOD has visited thee with his Sal∣vation.—On <HI>Monday</HI> midnight, as I was lying on my Bed, my Sleep departed from me, and I had no rest in my Spirit, because although the Weather was so exceeding Calm, and we in so great Distress, yet no Boat was sent to fetch us Provisions. Upon this I spoke to the Captain, and he to the Mate, who in the Morning went with a Boat, and about Noon this Day returned loaded with Provisions and Wa∣ter, and not only so, but told us, he was kindly in∣treated by the People he met with, especially by a great Country Gentleman, who came to his Seat at midnight, on purpose to relieve him and his Com∣panions; furnished them with a fresh Boat and other Necessaries, most kindly invited me, though unknown, to his House, to stay as long as I pleased; and has order'd Horses to wait ready to take me thither.</P>
<P>Who is so great, so good a GOD, as our GOD? Our Hour of Extremity was indeed come: For we had but half a Pint of Water left, and my Sto∣mach
<PB N="41" REF="004855_0020_100E02DD52D57CC8"/>
was exceeding weak, through my long Absti∣nence; but now his Almighty Arm hath brought us Salvation.</P>
<LG>
<L>Thro' all the changing Scenes of Life,</L>
<L>In Trouble and in Joy,</L>
<L>The Praises of my GOD shall still</L>
<L>My Heart and Tongue employ.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of his Deliverance I will boast,</L>
<L>Till all that are distrest</L>
<L>From my Example Comfort take,</L>
<L>And charm their Grief to rest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fear him ye Saints, and you will then</L>
<L>Have nothing else to fear;</L>
<L>Make you his Service your Delight,</L>
<L>Your Wants shall be his Care.</L>
</LG>
<P>As soon as the Provisions came, we kneeled down and returned hearty Thanks to our good GOD, who has heard our Prayers, and sent his Angel before us, to prepare our Way.</P>
<LG>
<L>Therefore my Lifes remaining Years,</L>
<L>Which GOD to me shall lend,</L>
<L>Will I in Praises to his Name,</L>
<L>And in his Service spend.</L>
</LG>
<P>A little before our Provisions came, I had been noting in my Diary, that I believed Deliverance was at Hand; for last Night and this Morning, I had the most violent Conflict within myself that I have had at all. Thus GOD always prepares me for his Mercies. <HI>Oh that this may strengthen my Faith, and make me willing to follow the Lamb wheresoever he shall be pleased to lead me, Amen,</HI> LORD JESUS, <HI>Amen!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="004855_0021_100E02DF52D19C98"/>
Still greater Mercies GOD confers on his unwor∣thy Servant. For after our Provisions were brought aboard, the Wind still continued fair, and by six at Night blew us to a little Place on <HI>Karrigholt</HI> Island, before which we cast Anchor. <HI>Praise the LORD, O my Soul, and all that is within me praise his Holy Name!</HI></P>
<P>Ever since I have been on Board the <HI>Mary,</HI> these Words, <Q>Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain Island</Q> (which were Part of the Lesson I read last at <HI>Savannah</HI>) have been continually press'd upon my Heart, so that I have often mention'd it to one of my Companions. Behold they are now fulfilled. <HI>Oh how unsearchable are thy Doings, O LORD, and thy Ways past finding out!</HI></P>
<P>Why GOD dealeth thus with me, I know not now, but I shall know hereafter. However this I know, that this Voyage has been greatly for my Good.—For I have had a glorious Opportunity of searching the Scriptures, composing Discourses, wri∣ting Letters, and communing with my own Heart.—We have been on Board just nine Weeks and three Days.—A long and perilous, but profitable Voyage to my Soul: For I hope it has learnt him, in some measure, to endure Hardships as becometh a Mini∣ster of CHRIST. My Cloaths have not been off (except to change me) all the Passage: Part of the Time I lay on open Deck, Part on a Chest, and the Remainder on a Bed-stead cover'd with my <HI>Buffa∣loe'</HI>s Skin. These Things, tho' little in themselves, yet are great in their Consequences; and whosoever despiseth small Acts of bodily Discipline, it is to be feared, will insensibly lose his spiritual Life by little
<PB N="43" REF="004855_0021_100E02DF52D19C98"/>
and little.—Many inward Trials also GOD has been pleased to send me, which I believe, he has sanctifi∣ed to my great Good. I am now going on Shore, to the House of a wealthy Gentleman, whom GOD has commanded to receive me. I may yet be expo∣sed to many Perils by Land e're I see my dear Friends. But his Grace who has preserved me from so many Perils by Water, will also be sufficient for me on dry Land. Whilst I continue on this side Eterni∣ty, I never expect to be free from Trials, only to change them. For it is necessary to heal the Pride of my Heart, that such should come: With a par∣ticular fear and trembling, I think of going to <HI>Lon∣don.</HI> But he that preserved <HI>Daniel</HI> in the Den of Lions, and the three Children in the fiery Furnace, will, I hope, preserve me from the fiery Trial of Popularity, and from the misguided Zeal of those, who without Cause, are my Enemies▪ <HI>Father, in∣to thy Hands I commend my Spirit. Magnify still thy free Grace in me. Guide me by thy unerring Wisdom, receive, O receive me for thy infinite Mercies sake, in</HI> CHRIST JESUS, <HI>into Glory hereafter!</HI></P>
<P>As for the Success of my Ministry, whilst on Board, I shall only say, That I hope much Sin has been prevented, and one I hope effectually conver∣ted, who is to be my Fellow Traveller to <HI>England. LORD if I can but be made instrumental to save one Soul▪ I care not if I am tossed on the Ocean through my whole Life. Glory be to GOD on High!</HI></P>
<P>It is observable that just as we had cast Anchor, a violent Wind rose, which (had it happen'd sooner) must have greatly hurt us. <HI>Marvellous are thy Works,</HI> O LORD, <HI>and that my Soul knoweth right well!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="004855_0022_100E02E135883558"/>
About seven at Night I dress'd myself and went on Shore, and was received in a strong Castle be∣longing to Mr. <HI>Mac Mahon,</HI> the Gentleman who sent me an Invitation. He himself was not at Home, having went some Miles up to meet me; but his Maid Servant kindly received us, <HI>I asked for Water, and she gave me Milk, and brought forth Butter in a lordly Dish:</HI> and never did I eat a more comforta∣ble Meal: About ten the Gentleman (having mis∣sed of me at the Place appointed) came through the Rain, and entertain'd us most hospitably, and about One we went to Bed; I hope with Hearts full of a Sense of the Divine Love. <HI>My Song shall hence∣forward be always of the Loving Kindness of the LORD. I will make mention of his Righteousness, and Truth, in the Assemblies of his Saints. Now our Water is turned into Wine.</HI></P>

<HEAD>KILRUSH in IRELAND.</HEAD>
<P>This Morning about 11 o'Clock, after being most hospitably entertain'd by Mr. <HI>Mac Mahon,</HI> and fur∣nished with Three Horses, I and my Servant and my new Convert set out for <HI>Dublin</HI> and reached <HI>Kil∣rush,</HI> a little Town, about eight <HI>Irish</HI> Miles from <HI>Kirrigholt,</HI> about two in the Afternoon, where we where sweetly refreshed; and tarried the Remainder of the Day with Captain <HI>Coc,</HI> who last Night with his whole Crew was like to be shipwreck'd; but this Morning, by the good Providence of GOD, was brought hither on Shore. <HI>Surely my Ship-mates will, of all Men be most miserable if they continue impeni∣tent, having such loud and repeated Calls from GOD.</HI></P>
<P>As I rode along, and observed the Meanness of the poor People's living in these Parts, I said, if my

Parishioners at <HI>Georgia,</HI> complain to me of Hard∣ships, I must tell them how the <HI>Irish</HI> live; for their Habitations are far more despicable, and their Living as hard, I believe as to Food; and yet, no doubt, Content dwells in many of these low Huts. <HI>A Man's Life does not consist in the Abundance of the Things which he possesseth.</HI></P>
<P>At my first coming into our Inn, we kneeled down and prayed; and again at Night sung Psalms, and prayed with the Captain and several of my Ship-mates.—The first Time I believe the Room was ever put to such a Use by a Ship's Crew and their Chaplain.</P>

<P><HI>Friday, Nov.</HI> 17. Had a very pleasant ride, over a fine fruitful open Country to <HI>Fourthfargus,</HI> a Vil∣lage as was reckoned only ten, but at a moderate Computation thirty <HI>English</HI> Miles from <HI>Kilrush:</HI> But this is not the first Piece of <HI>Irish</HI> I have met with.—<HI>Their innocent Blunders often extort Smiles from me.</HI></P>
<P>As I stopped to have my Horses shoe'd I went into one of the Poor Peoples Cabins, as they call them; but it may as well be called a Stye, a Barn, or a Poultry Coop. It was about twenty Feet long, and twelve broad, the Walls built with Turf and Mud. In it, was a Man threshing Corn, two Swine feeding; two Dogs, several Geese; a Man, his Wife, three Children, and a great Fire.—<HI>Georgia</HI> Hutts are a Palace to it.—Indeed the People live very poorly in this Part, some walk barefoot with their Shoes in their Hands to save them from wearing out, others out of Necessity.
<PB N="46" REF="004855_0023_100E02E3B2B8C590"/>
And I observed many of their Feet to be much swell'd, and ready to gush out with Blood, through extremity of Cold.—<HI>LORD, Why is my Lot cast into a fairer Ground? Thy free Grace alone has made the Difference!</HI></P>
<P>Whilst I was in the Cabin, as they call their little <HI>Irish</HI> Huts, I talk'd with the Woman in the House, and found she was a <HI>Roman Catholick:</HI> And indeed the whole Commonalty almost, are of the <HI>Romish</HI> Profession, and seem to be so very Ignorant, that they may well be termed the <HI>Wild Irish.</HI> No Wonder, when the Key of Knowledge is taken from them. Wo unto their blind Guides. I can think of no likelier Means to convert them from their erroneous Principles, than to get the Bible translated into their own native Language, to have it put in their Houses, and Charity-Schools erected for their Children, as Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> has done in <HI>Wales,</HI> which would insensibly weaken the <HI>Romish Interest:</HI> For when once they could be convinced that they were imposed upon, they would no longer suffer themselves to be misled▪ <HI>Oh that some Man, in whom is the Spirit of the Holy GOD, would undertake this!</HI></P>

About two this Afternoon we reach'd <HI>Limerick,</HI> a large Garrison Town, with a Cathedral in it, about twenty one <HI>English</HI> Miles from <HI>Fourthfargus.</HI> The Roads, as we came along, grew better; but the People much more subtle and designing. Here are also many Beggars, which I impute to the Want of Parish Provisions for them.—At Even∣ing-Prayer we went to the Cathedral, and return∣ed publick Thanks for our safe Arrival. The Remainder of the Night was spent in necessary Business, refreshing our Bodies, religious Conver∣sation, and in writing some Things I stood in need of.</P>
<P>Good GOD! Where was I last <HI>Saturday?</HI> In Hunger, Cold and Thirsting; but now I enjoy Fulness of Bread, and all Things convenient for me, GOD grant, I may not, <HI>Jeshurun like, wax fat and kick.</HI> Perhaps it is more difficult to know how to abound, than how to want. But I endea∣vour to receive both with Thanksgiving.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, Nov.</HI> 20. Having sent last Night to in∣form Dr. <HI>Burscough,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Limerick,</HI> that I was lately arrived: At his Lorship's appointment, I waited on him this Morning, and was received with the utmost Candour and Civility. At his Lordship's Request, I preached this Morning at the Cathedral, to a very numerous Audience, who seem'd universally affected, and full of expectation that I would preach in the Afternoon; but Pro∣vidence did not seem to open a Door. But why should not a Strange Minister always offer his Ser∣vice? I think it is a wrong Piece of Modesty not to do it. For a Sermon from a Stranger may do more Good than many from those the People are constantly used to.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="004855_0024_100E02E6DB53D598"/>
After Sermon the Mayor sent twice to invite me, but I was pre-engaged to the Bishop, who kindly invited both me and my Friend, thanked me for my Sermon, and offered me the free Use of his Palace, and would have insisted on my accept∣ing of it, had I not told his Lordship I was to leave <HI>Limerick</HI> in the Morning: <HI>Oh into what a wealthy Place has my Good GOD brought me?</HI> How does he every where command some or other to receive me? As I was eating at Dinner, I was meditating on the Divine Goodness in spreading such a Table for me, when last <HI>Sunday</HI> I was in danger almost of perishing with Hunger. But I thought at the same Time, if this was so great a Blessing, what an in∣finitely greater one will it be, after the Troubles of this Life, to sit down and eat Bread in the Kingdom of GOD. <HI>O that I may be accounted worthy of that heavenly Banquet!</HI></P>

<P><HI>Monday, Nov.</HI> 20. Went about <HI>Limerick</HI> Town this Morning, to dispatch some necessary Business. And found the good Seed sown yester∣day, had received a Blessing from above. For all the Inhabitants seem'd alarmed, and look'd most wishfully at me, as I passed along. One substan∣tial Tradesman in particular even compell'd me to come in, and shewed me and my Friend uncom∣mon Civilities, and told me how solicitous the Peo∣ple were for my staying longer.—Another came to my Inn, and begg'd me to come and see him, which I did.—And the good Bishop, when I went to take Leave of his Lordship, kissed me, and said these Words, <Q>Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> GOD bless

you, I wish you Success abroad. Had you staid in Town, this House should have been your home.</Q></P>
<P>About four in the Afternoon, against much Per∣suasion to the contrary, we left <HI>Limerick,</HI> and reach'd <HI>Tuller-Bridge,</HI> about six Miles distant from thence by six o'Clock, where I and my Friend were agreeably refreshed, and spent the Remainder of the Evening in writing to some at <HI>Limerick,</HI> and strengthning one another, and blessing GOD for these fresh Instances of his unmerited Mercies.

<P>In my Way I had a short Conference with a <HI>Roman Catholick,</HI> who seem'd more knowing than the Generality of those of that Persuasion, but sadly misguided.

<P>As far as I can find by all I converse with, they place Religion in being of the <HI>Protestant</HI> or <HI>Roman Catholick</HI> Communion, and are quite ignorant of the Nature of inward Purity and Holiness of Heart. <HI>Lord, the Christian World is cast into a deep Sleep, send forth, I beseech thee, some faithful and true Pastors to awaken them out of it!</HI></P>

<P>Two Things I can remark much for the Credit of <HI>Ireland,</HI> that the Roads, especially to <HI>Dublin,</HI> are surprisingly Good, and Provisions exceeding cheap. A Person may travel without much Expence.</P>

<HEAD>NANTWICH.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Friday, December</HI> 1. Rode from <HI>Park-Gate</HI> to <HI>Nantwich,</HI> in hopes of seeing my old Friend Mr. <HI>Salmon,</HI> but GOD was pleased to disappoint me. However, he enlarged my Heart, and enabled me to write several Letters to Friends at <HI>Dublin;</HI> and I now, as I have often done before, make this Remark, "That GOD never disappoints us one Way, but he opens a Door to do good in another.</P>

<HEAD>MANCHESTER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Saturday, December</HI> 2. Reached <HI>Manchester,</HI> by four this Afternoon, and was much edified by dear Mr. <HI>Clayton'</HI>s judicious Christian Conversation, for the Benefit of which, I came so far out of my Way.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, December</HI> 3. Preached twice at Mr. <HI>Clayton'</HI>s Chapel to a thronged and very attentive Audience, especially in the Afternoon, assisted with six more Ministers in administring the blessed Sacra∣ment to three hundred Communicants. Never did I see a Table more richly spread, nor a greater Or∣der and Decency observed.—<HI>Blessed be God for my coming to</HI> Manchester, <HI>I hope it has greatly benefited and strengthned my Soul.</HI>—<HI>This has been a Sabbath indeed! May it prepare me for that eternal Rest which awaits the Children of God!</HI></P>

<P><HI>Monday, December</HI> 4. Set out at Day-break and got to <HI>Stone,</HI> thirty four Miles from <HI>Manchester,</HI> by five in the Evening, was a little fatigu'd; but quite refreshed by the Morning.—<HI>Blessed be God for these Conveniencies. Oh that I may always look upon myself as a Stranger and a Sojourner upon Earth!</HI></P>

<HI>Friday, December</HI> 8. After having rode thirty six Miles on <HI>Tuesday,</HI> and twenty four on <HI>Wednesday,</HI> on <HI>Thursday</HI> about three in the Afternoon reached St. <HI>Albans.</HI>—In the Morning I set out for <HI>London,</HI> and was agreeably surprized with the Sight of some of my Christian Friends, on the Road, who were coming to meet me, which put me in Mind of St. <HI>Paul'</HI>s Friends, meeting him at the three Taverns, and I like him, was not a little comforted. <HI>Oh, that I may like him also, be willing to follow my Ma∣ster wheresoever he shall be pleased to call me, not counting even my Life dear unto myself, so that I may finish my Course with Joy!</HI></P>

<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<L>Shall I, for Fear of feeble Man,</L>
<L>Thy Spirits Course in me restrain?</L>
<L>Or undismay'd in Deed and Word,</L>
<L>Be a true Witness to my Lord?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>Aw'd by a Mortal's Frown Shall I</L>
<L>Conceal the Word of GOD most High?</L>
<L>How then before thee shall I dare</L>
<L>To stand, or how thy Anger bear?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>No; let Man rage! since thou wilt spread</L>
<L>Thy shadowing Winds around my Head:</L>
<L>Since in all Pain thy tender Love</L>
<L>Will still my sweet Refreshment prove.</L>
</LG>

<L>Saviour of Men! thy searching Eye</L>
<L>Does all my inmost Thoughts descry:</L>
<L><PB N="54" REF="004855_0027_100E02ED735F0BF8"/>
Doth ought on Earth my Wishes raise?</L>
<L>Or the World's Favour, or its Praise?</L>

<LG>
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<L>The Love of CHRIST does me constrain,</L>
<L>To seek the wand'ring Souls of Men:</L>
<L>With Cries, Intreaties, Tears to save,</L>
<L>To snatch them from the gasping Grave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<L>For this let Men revile my Name,</L>
<L>No Cross I shun, I fear no Shame:</L>
<L>All hail, Reproach, and welcome Pain!</L>
<L>Only thy Terrors, LORD, restrain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<L>My Life, my Blood I here present,</L>
<L>If for thy Truth they may be spent,</L>
<L>Fulfil thy Sov'reign Counsel, LORD:</L>
<L>Thy Will be done? thy Name ador'd!</L>
</LG>

<HEAD>VIII.</HEAD>
<L>Give me thy Strength, O GOD of Power!</L>
<L>Then let Winds blow, or Thunders roar,</L>
<L>Thy faithful Witness will I be—</L>
<L>'Tis fix'd! I can do all thro' Thee!</L>
