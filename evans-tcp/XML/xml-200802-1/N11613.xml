</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HOME-FELT joys, this day, possess our breasts, on account of the distinguishing blessings of LIBERTY and FREEDOM, which illustriously exert them∣selves, animating the members of this community.</P>
<P>LIBERTY! the darling of generous and noble souls, extends her hand once more, without controul, to give in her suffrages for men to rule us in the fear of GOD.</P>
<P>WITH gratitude to the Almighty Preserver of our privileges, we see the returns of this joyful anniversa∣ry; and the leaders of this people assembled, to im∣plore wisdom and influence from heaven, to conduct our public affairs at this difficult and trying day.</P>
<P>GLOOMY and threatning indeed, is the cloud impend∣ing our land and nation. Our privileges, civil and sa∣cred,
<PB N="6" REF="014675_0005_0F948B87DB2BE308"/>
are imminently endangered. Under these alarming circumstances, the admonitory language of divine pro∣vidence and revelation is this, <HI>Stand fast in the liberty wherewith CHRIST hath made us free.</HI></P>
<P>BY an allegory borrowed from what is written con∣cerning <HI>Sarah</HI> and <HI>Hagar,</HI> and their respective offspring, the apostle had been illustrating their distinguishing privileges: Immediately upon which, our text is in∣troduced—of a noble import, considered only as res∣pecting christian liberty. But it is proposed, upon this occasion, to apply in a more general view, what might be suggested with a particular reference.</P>
<P>WE have glorious privileges asserted—liberty and freedom belonging to us, not merely as men, originally created in GOD'S image, holding a distinguished rank in his creation, but also as christians, redeemed by the blood of CHRIST. The divine author, purchaser and bestower of all these mercies and blessings, expresly men∣tioned CHRIST JESUS, who, by his perfect obedience and the sacrifice of himself made compleat atonement for sin—purchased reconciliation with GOD—temporal favours and blessings for a ruined world, and eternal glory for all that truly believe in him.</P>
<P>HERE is also a very important duty, enjoined by the highest authority, to exert ourselves in maintaining and defending our liberties and privileges. <HI>Stand fast,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>AS our privileges, civil and sacred, are nearly relat∣ed, each one being a part of the grand whole; so we shall consider briefly,
<LIST>

<ITEM>BY whom these were PURCHASED for and BESTOWED upon us.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="7" REF="014675_0006_0F948B87F6F87E98"/>
WHAT is IMPLIED in the DUTY ENJOINED, to STAND FAST THEREIN.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>FIRST. As to our liberty and freedom, civil and re∣ligious. These may be considered as general terms, in∣cluding our inestimable rights and privileges of a civil and sacred nature.</P>
<P>MAN was originally formed such a creature, and plac∣ed in those circumstances that infinite wisdom determined it was not good for him to live alone. The glorious CREATOR put him under strong and endearing obliga∣tions of convenience, inclination and necessity to in∣duce him into society, furnishing him with reason and language to continue and enjoy it. For perpetual soli∣tude the human mind was not adapted, nor the strength of an individual proportionate to his necessities. From hence society appears convenient and necessary.</P>
<P>THE state of nature is a state of freedom and equali∣ty. No one can therein challenge a superiority over o∣thers. Every man was amenable to GOD alone. Nor could he invade his neighbour's property, or abridge his natural liberty, without violating one of nature's most sacred laws. In this apostate world, the inability of mo∣ral virtue renders government absolutely necessary.</P>
<P>THE motives upon which individuals made a particu∣lar surrender of that plenitude of power which they possess in a state of nature, are abundantly obvious. For, though in that state, no one was subject to the controul of another; but in this respect was absolute lord of his own person and possessions; yet every one being his equal, and the greater part no strict observers of justice and equity; the enjoyment of property, in this situation must be very precarious. Therefore he volun∣tarily relinquishes that condition which must necessarily
<PB N="8" REF="014675_0007_0F948B890DE7F790"/>
be attended with unceasing fears and dangers, to unite with others for the mutual preservation of their lives, li∣berties and properties. But then—freedom from abso∣lute, despotic power is so necessary unto, and closely connected with a man's preservation that he cannot part with it, but by what forfeits his preservation and life together.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide Lock on Gov. Blackst. Comment, &amp;c.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>WHEN mankind form into society and submit to the necessary restrictions and subordinations of government, it lies with the people, under GOD, to determine who shall make and execute the laws by which they shall be governed. Man's liberty in society is to be under no legislative power, but that established in the common wealth; and to be subject to no human laws but those enacted by that legislature. These are conceived to be first principles, coeval with time, and sanctified by use—of importance in the disputes of the present day.</P>
<P>As to the rights and immunities of a free state, we have been most highly favoured of the LORD. When new states were founded upon the ruins of the Roman empire, a free form of government, obtained in <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and various other parts of Europe. Under the <HI>Saxon</HI> heptarchy and after the union of those kingdoms, liberty prevailed in <HI>England,</HI> as history informs us.</P>
<P>UPON the Norman conquest, despotic power was es∣tablished by King William the first. His son, to secure his crown, solemnly engaged to restore it's ancient laws and government. Similar promises were made by some succeeding Princes, who neglected the due performance and involved the nation in a bloody war. The Barons and people nobly exerted themselves to recover their li∣berties, 'till the charter of British privileges, the Magna Charta, was solemnly confirmed by King John. Sordid
<PB N="9" REF="014675_0008_0F948B89798474F0"/>
attempts have since been made, to deprive the people of their inestimable rights; which have ever involved their authors in wretched misfortunes; terminating in the loss of their lives or crowns. The lawless endea∣vours of Charles the first, to establish arbitrary govern∣ment, introduced a civil war, which raged until his blood quenched the flame. His son, King James the second, enterprized absolute rule, and had almost sub∣verted the civil and religious liberties of his country. At this critical time GOD raised up, and the people, vi∣gilant of their rights, invited over the Prince of Orange; upon which James abdicated the throne and kingdom. Thus hath GOD preserved our nation, in times past.</P>
<P>THE American colonies in general, and <HI>Connecticut</HI> in special, have enjoyed most distinguishing privileges. If a perfect civil constitution cannot be found existing; yet our own we esteem, by far, the most eligible; the ad∣vantages of which are illustriously demonstrated at the present day. Our legislature consists of two houses, an∣nually elected by the freemen of the corporation, under the sacred solemnity of an oath, to give in their suffrages so as they verily believe in their consciences may be most conducive to the best good of the government. Beyond all dispute, frequent elections are a noble preservative from the execrable sin of venality in rulers. Our General Assembly, thus composed, enact our laws, appoint our judges, erect our courts, prescribe their powers, and adjust the method of procedure. Our rulers are not fo∣reigners obtruded upon us, from whence, interference of interest and disaffection would naturally arise. While the people retain their elective power, rulers must neces∣sarily share very largely in the choicest affections of a free people. Such hath been the public virtue of this people, that those in highest seats of honor, dignity and authority, in this colony, have been revered for their
<PB N="10" REF="014675_0009_0F948B8A337CF438"/>
superior wisdom and integrity, virtue, magnanimity and piety. The public have been served, from time to time, by men of probity and a public spirit. Instead of the bramble in Jotham's parable, to distress us, we have sat under the shadow of a pleasant and fruitful vine—Our air healthful—our soil fertile, liberally rewarding the diligent husbandmen—yielding different crops for our sustenance. If one fail, a famine may not ensue, as it doth in many countries. Every town is a corporation invested with singular power to suppress immoralities which are provoking to GOD, and destructive to civil so∣ciety. Every family is entitled to the strength of the community for its defence. We have enjoyed all the sweets and felt very little of the burdens of government.</P>
<P>WHILE our government is so popular; yet where are civil rulers and executive courts so truly revered as in this colony? Where is so little of riotous and factious behaviour?</P>
<P>AS our civil liberties and privileges are nearly connect∣ed with, and greatly promotive of our religious (on which account they are chiefly to be esteemed) so our religious privileges are not inferior to our civil. Every one has GOD'S word, may read and judge for himself—may wor∣ship GOD in the way he verily believes Heaven will ap∣prove. Every ecclesiastical society may chuse its own minister, and provide for his support. Happily deli∣vered from Romish superstition, unappointed rites and ceremonies, and that ecclesiastical hierarchy, which neither we, nor our fathers were able to bear—we <HI>may serve God without fear.</HI> Difference of sentiment res∣pecting the non-essentials of religion, seems one of the unavoidable consequences of man's dreadful apostacy. None may impose for doctrine, the commandments of men; or force others to believe with them. Surely
<PB N="11" REF="014675_0010_0F948B8AF5ECFA38"/>
the sacred rights of conscience, are ever to be treated with utmost delicacy. But if any under pretence of conscience, sap the foundation of civil society, or ma∣terially injure it, they are to be restrained by the ci∣vil arm. Civil rulers are GOD'S ministers for good to mankind—a terror to evil works, and to punish evil doers, by salutary laws, faithfully executed. In fa∣vour of virtue, to suppress immorality, and support religion, we have a system of excellent laws enacted, while different persuasions enjoy the most generous li∣berty and freedom. What greater civil or christian liberty can be enjoyed, or even wish'd for, than the in∣habitants of this colony are indulged?</P>
<P>THAT no external advantage may be wanting, to render us happy, if we are not wanting to ourselves; we have a flourishing seminary of learning in the co∣lony, for the instruction of our youth; from whence many streams have issued, rejoicing the church and city of our GOD.</P>
<P>A PEOPLE thus <HI>exalted to heaven,</HI> should be all grati∣tude to GOD for discriminating favours—emulous to excel in obedience and subjection, by leading most <HI>quiet and peaceable lives, in all godliness and honesty.</HI></P>
<P>SECONDLY, To consider by whom these privileges were purchased for, and bestowed upon us?</P>
<P>ALL things were originally created by CHRIST. A∣dam was placed at the head of this lower creation, with dominion over all creatures therein—crowned <HI>with glo∣ry and honor, but little inferior to the angels in heaven.</HI>—Soon did man dreadfully apostatize from a state of pri∣meval integrity. This was an act of the most horrid treason against the KING of KINGS. Thereby the whole patrimony of temporal and spiritual blessings was con∣fiscated.
<PB N="12" REF="014675_0011_0F948B8BC2458EE8"/>
CHRIST JESUS interposed, redeemed the ali∣enated inheritance, <HI>being appointed heir of all things, visi∣ble and invisible.</HI> By purchase and by power, <HI>he delivers from the bondage of corruption, and vindicates into the glo∣rious liberty of the children of God.</HI></P>
<P>HAVE sinners a reprieve from hopeless torment?—The means of grace afforded?—The schools of CHRIST opened?—His gospel preached, and ordinances ad∣ministered, to train us up for heaven?—Have we free access to GOD, and hopes of glory? All flow from CHRIST as their foundation. Are temporal favours confer'd upon sinful creatures? They come from CHRIST who is <HI>heir of all things, and by whom all things consist.</HI> Every blessing is therefore to be considered as flowing to us through the blood of JESUS. Civil government is his institution. <HI>The powers that be, are ordained of God. By him, princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.</HI> In scripture, we have the character of civil ru∣lers decypher'd—the design of government pointed out—the duty of subjects enforced. In carrying into ex∣ecution the glorious purposes of divine providence and grace, GOD hath chosen, in numberless instances, to use the mediation of others. Agreeably, civil rulers are his <HI>ministers for good to mankind;</HI> while CHRIST is the origi∣nal from whence flow all our blessings.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, What is implied in the duty enjoin'd, <HI>Stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free.</HI></P>
<P>THAT others may endeavour by fraud or violence to deprive us of our inestimable privileges, is here sup∣posed; yet we must assert them; highly esteem, and conscientiously improve them; zealously, and with ut∣most vigour, exert ourselves to maintain and defend them.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="014675_0012_0F948B8C875A2BF0"/>
THE duty enjoin'd in our text supposes that others may endeavour, by fraud or violence to deprive us of our inestimable rights and privileges. We need'nt re∣vert to the history of past ages, to find this ex∣emplified. Not long since, the British parliament made solemn declaration, "<HI>That it has a right to make laws binding upon the colonies, in all cases whatsoever.</HI> In conse∣quence of which, taxes have been imposed upon us without our consent—chartered privileges vacated—various cruel edicts passed. The time would fail us to enumerate and particularly consider those which vi∣olate our essential rights. To enfore which edicts, fleets and armies have been sent over, compelling us ei∣ther to disobey the divine precept in our text, or engage in a civil war. These colonies have nobly chosen the latter. Whoever will impartially consider the tragical scenes of the past year, and the causes of them (me thinks) cannot help but see that our precious privile∣ges have been invaded; and that heaven hath arrested the hand of violence in its ravages. At <HI>Lexington,</HI> our countrymen were attack'd, fired upon, and some of them impiously slain. From thence the inhuman mur∣derers of their fellow-subjects, proceeded to <HI>Concord;</HI> up∣on which an action ensued "<HI>inglorious to the British arms.</HI>" The horrors of a civil war then commenced.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the violence used to deprive us of our inestimable rights and privileges, we are under indispensible obligations to assert them. As rational creatures, and professing christians, a competent know∣ledge of, and acquaintance with them is to be ob∣tained. What is sacred by the laws of GOD, nature and compact, may not be buried in oblivion, or sunk under the carnal rubbish of luxury and stupidity. The rights belonging to us, as men and christians, we are to understand and assert.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="014675_0013_0F948B8D59659640"/>
AGAIN. We must highly esteem, and conscientiously improve them. They demand our highest attention. GOD'S glory, our own and other's best good, with hea∣ven's special command, lay us under the most sacred obligations thus to value them. Were they of trifling importance, or our necks galled with the yoke of des∣potic power and oppression (those engines of accumu∣lated misery and destruction to mankind) our case had been far different. But (blessed be GOD) from those dread∣ful curses we are hitherto delivered. We are called to LIBERTY, one of heaven's choicest blessings to man∣kind. Amidst the various calamities of life, LIBERTY administers consolation—redoubles the pleasures of our highest gratifications—inspires the human breast with noblest sentiments—dilates the heart—expands the soul, and is the source of almost every thing excellent and desirable on earth. This animates industry and oeco∣nomy—promotes commerce—procures wealth—che∣rishes the liberal arts and sciences, and wears a most friendly aspect upon all the most important interests of mankind, while it encourages and promotes the pro∣fession and practice of religion.</P>
<P>LIBERTY is the glory of a community, and ensures its felicity so long as it is retained. SLAVERY, on the other hand, debases the mind—clogs the finest move∣ments of the soul; discourages industry, frugality, and every thing praise-worthy; introduces ignorance and poverty, with the most fordid vices, and universal mi∣sery. How striking the contrast! If this cannot convey any tolerable idea of the blessings of FREE∣DOM, let the history of mankind inform us, and the ab∣ject condition of those people where slavery clanks her chains, contrasted with those that are free born. In <HI>Turkey,</HI> every house, at the death of it's master, is at the disposal of the Grand Segnior.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="014675_0014_0F948B90C56F0978"/>
<Q>LIBERTY, (says a celebrated author) is the natural birth-right of mankind; and yet, to take a compre∣hensive view of the world, how few enjoy it! What a melancholy reflection is it to think, that more than nine tenths of the species should be miserable slaves to despotic tyrants! The largest part of the world, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Asia,</HI> is despotic throughout. Anarchy may rule the wandering Tartars and Arabs, but their numbers are very small. Here we fall at once on the most nu∣merous body of people in the world, in a state of sla∣very. <HI>Africa</HI> comes next; and what misery involves that vast country! Liberty only exists at one Cape, an exotic plant of European growth, unless we ex∣hibit the Hottentots as the only specimen of <HI>African</HI> freedom! In Europe itself, what a disproportion be∣tween liberty and slavery! <HI>Russia, Poland,</HI> the chief of <HI>Germany, Hungary, Turkey,</HI> the greatest part of <HI>Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, Denmark</HI> and <HI>Norway.</HI> The following bear no proportion to them, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the Bri∣tish isles (observe, this writer is an Englishman) <HI>Sweeden, Holland, Switzerland,</HI> and the <HI>Germanic</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> states. And in <HI>America, Spain, Portugal</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> have planted despotism; only <HI>Britain,</HI> Li∣berty.</Q></P>
<P><Q>ON the whole, what a trifling part of the globe's inhabitants, enjoy what all have, by nature, a right to! How insignificant is the number of those who possess the greatest of blessings, compared with the unhappy tribes who are cruelly deprived of it! The inhabitants of the world are supposed to amount to about 775,300,000 souls; of these, the arbitrary go∣vernments command 741,800,000, and the free ones only 33,500,000; and of these few, so large a por∣tion as 12,500,000, are, (or have been) subjects of
<PB N="16" REF="014675_0015_0F948B91D06232D8"/>
the <HI>British</HI> empire.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Polit. Essays on the present state of the British Empire.</HI></NOTE></Q> Perhaps we may further de∣duct almost all the inhabitants of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> from the number of those free.</P>
<P>BY the price paid for them, especially by the blood of the great REDEEMER, and as they are transmitted to us through the blood of our illustrious ancestors, let our privileges be estimated. Shall not those so glori∣ously purchased, and nobly transmitted, be highly es∣teemed, and conscientiously improved?</P>
<P>OUR ever memorable ancestors, left their native coun∣try, in times unfriendly to liberty, civil and religious; and gave illustrious proofs of rising superior to the most discouraging obstacles; leaving their houses, lands, and tenderest connections, with every thing dear and esti∣mable among men, for the undisturbed fruition of those rights, sacred by the laws of GOD and nature. For this they brav'd the dangers of the sea, surmounting perils, want, toil, famine, and even the sword of the wilderness; among the asperities of nature, seeking an asylum for liberty, which they sought in vain from the justice and policy of a powerful empire. GOD sent them into the world to plead the cause of liberty, and prepare western mansions against arbitrary power, for the persecuted lovers of freedom. Having by purchase or conquest, obtained an indisputable title to their lands; they cou'd'nt but think the produce, by the divine blessing on their labors, to be their property, with an exclusive right of disposal. Property without this, is but an insignificant name. To them was ratified a legislative power, respecting their internal policy. They quitted the mortal stage with joyful hopes that this fair inheritance, purchased at a vast expence of treasure and blood, would be transmitted, unimpaired, to their
<PB N="17" REF="014675_0016_0F948B9278834130"/>
posterity. Our privileges are a most noble legacy, be∣queathed to us; a sacred deposit, committed to our care. Blood infinitely precious, was the original pur∣chase, and rather than despotic power should prevail, let us seal the surrender with the last drop of our own. What are the lives of this numerous assembly, with my∣riads added thereto, if our blood may be honored as the channel of conveyance for our precious privileges, to countless multitudes yet unborn!</P>
<P>METHINKS we may this day, well nigh see the ghosts of our departed progenitors, and hear those blessed wor∣thies, in solemn accents, through the vast of Heaven, addressing us, saying, <Q><HI>Stand fast in the liberty wherewith</HI> CHRIST <HI>hath made you free.</HI> At the inestimable price of his blood, the glorious REDEEMER purchased these bles∣sings for his people. Through rivers of blood, and great tribulation we have been made the instruments of hand∣ing these down to you. Let your hearts glow with most ardent gratitude to the fountain of all grace and mer∣cy, and your lives be entirely devoted to GOD'S glory. Wisely estimate, improve and maintain your inestima∣ble privileges civil and sacred. Nor can you wanton∣ly throw them away, without incurring JEHOVAH'S most tremendous indignation and curse. GOD, Angels and Saints in glory are looking on. When you have such a glorious cause, and such spectators, consider, what should be your behaviour. Trust in GOD, and firmly defy every danger. Let the blood of CHRIST animate you. Your heaven daring impieties, profane∣ness, intemperance, and other abounding iniquities, contempt of gospel grace, and abuse of the most blessed privileges, have procured your present calamities. <HI>Remember from whence ye are fallen, repent and do the first works;</HI> and Zion's GOD will support his cause in America. Heaven demands your most vigorous ex∣ertions.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="014675_0017_0F948B9334D20C88"/>
OUGHT we not then to be zealously engaged? Are not our sacred as well as civil privileges greatly threaten∣ed? Is not the King of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> by the Quebec bill, set at the head of the Romish church in <HI>Canada?</HI> A colony of far greater extent than the islands of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI> Let us be zealous in a good cause, defending the truths of the gospel with the armour of light; without the least shuddering at the impotent thun∣ders of papal mandates. What awful tragedies hath u∣surped authority acted, in church and state! It hath shed rivers of blood—introduced purgatory, transub∣stantiation, with all the other absurdities of the church of Rome. Men's souls, no less than their bodies are thereby enslaved.</P>
<P>THOSE servile doctrines of indefeasible right, passive obedience, and non-resistance, are not the doctrines of reason, good policy or revelation. An attempt to vin∣dicate them from scripture is highly criminal. Obedi∣ence to lawful authority, acting agreeable to this insti∣tution, Heaven strictly enjoins; and by this argument enforces <HI>they are ministers of</HI> GOD <HI>for good.</HI> But, when they become the reverse, and counteract every kind design of Heaven in their ordination—rob mankind of their rights—plunder and destroy them—form conspiracies a∣gainst freedom and the state—commence rebels to the laws of their country, of nature, of reason and of GOD—that the Apostle's argument for entire subjection, re∣tains its force or that resistance is then a damnable sin, wants proof. The history of all ages will evince that the public interest hath succeeded best, when the peo∣ple have retained, in a good measure, the power in their own hands.</P>
<P>IF our privileges are abridged, our country suffers, in whose welfare, every thing dear to us on earth is involv∣ed.
<PB N="19" REF="014675_0018_0F948B93F3DEDEA0"/>
If it flourishes, all our interests are better secured. We must share our country's fate. From sordid views, despicable hopes or fears, possibly some few, may be so vile as to abandon their GOD and country. Human language wants a name, to paint out those.—We have the means of perpetuating our privileges, by the divine blessing on our endeavours. Our present distresses loudly admonish us to stir up ourselves in the fear of GOD. Nor may the moral causes thereof be forgotten. The judgments of GOD are executed in token of his an∣ger, and to wake up the guilty, secure sinner, that he may learn righteousness and flee from the wrath to come</P>
<P>WITH deepest penitence, we should reflect upon our stupidity and carelessness, so provoking to GOD, under his solemn, remarkable goings. Wonderful have been the dispensations of divine providence towards us and our fathers in this land. GOD sent the wasting pestilence before them to make way for the ransomed of the LORD to come in. By a series of remarkable providences GOD hath defended and established the protestant cause in A∣merica. How often did our predecessors experience glorious salvation while their numerous enemies were vanquished! Sometimes, GOD with his own hand hath immediately destroyed those that sought our ruin. Thus he did to that powerful French armament, which was sent against us, soon after the reduction of <HI>Cape-Briton,</HI> the last war but one. To go no further back than the last year; GOD hath been merciful to us (in many instanc∣es) not only beyond our deserts, but beyond our expec∣tations. The battle at Lexington and Concord (hinted at above) in which a thousand disciplined Britons, hav∣ing by night marched out, suddenly fell upon and in∣humanly massacred a few of our countrymen; but were obliged precipitantly to retreat the same day; leaving many dead, having more wounded, and before night the rest almost harrassed to death.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="014675_0019_0F948B94AF5E7318"/>
SOON after this, Ticonderoga was taken by our men without the effusion of any blood. A martial spirit a∣nimated the united colonies. <HI>The people willingly offered themselves to come up to the help of the</HI> LORD <HI>against the mighty.</HI> Several regiments in this colony, as soon as en∣listing orders were received, almost instantaneously en∣listed; and more than were wanted were so engaged to go, they could hardly be restrained.</P>
<P>VARIOUS artifices had been used to engage several tribes of Indians to fight against us; but were remarka∣bly unsuccessful. Those who in all former wars thirst∣ed for our blood, would now be at peace with us, not∣withstanding the unjustifiable methods taken to induce them to distress our frontiers.</P>
<P>AT the battle on Bunker's-Hill, in which so few of our men were killed, when almost surrounded with un∣equal numbers and a multitude of cannon, and many, (perhaps more than a thousand) of the enemy were slain, the hand of GOD is to be devoutly acknowledged, in co∣vering the heads of our men in the day of battle. This action was remarkably calculated to teach our men cir∣cumspection in their advances, and inure them to the thunder of cannon. How suprisingly were they spirit∣ed, longing for another battle!</P>
<P>WHEN our northern army had invested the fort of St. John's and almost expended their ammunition; that Chamblee should then be taken, with plenty of warlike stores, whereby our army was supplied, was owing to a most gracious providence. Presently upon which St. John's surrendered. General Carleton left Montreal, of which our troops took possession and several vessels in the river. Repeated successes are apt to have a far different effect upon mankind, in this fallen state, from what they ought. Instead of endearing the author of all

good to them, and making them more firmly trust in the LORD, they may be, and oftentimes are guilty of <HI>sacrificing to their own nets,</HI> indulging carnal confidence, "To forsake the alliance of Heaven—trust in means and fetch all our hope and spirit from such feeble things as ourselves, is such an horrid affront to almighty GOD, that his honor calls for the highest resentment." He sends such offenders <HI>to the Gods they have chosen and served,</HI> say∣ing, <HI>let these deliver you in the time of your tribulation. Cursed be the man that believeth in man.</HI> Whether we have not been guilty in these respects, should seriously be consi∣dered. The strong city of Quebec, defended ('tis said) by 1500 men, was invested and afterwards attempted to be stormed, by about one thousand of our men. In this vigorous attack, the gallant General Montgomery, with a number more was slain; some were captivated and the rest repulsed. But these, about 600 in num∣ber, maintained the blockade of Quebec, till assistance arrived. This repulse, Heaven might see necessary to rouse the attention of these colonies to that place, of ut∣most importance to the securing of Canada, and the In∣dians in our interest, so that our frontiers may remain unmolested.</P>
<P>"THE relief of BOSTON from the cruel and oppres∣sive invasion of those, who were sent to erect the stand∣ard of lawless domination and to trample on the rights of humanity, must give pleasure to every virtuous and sympathetic heart—and being effected without the effu∣sion of the blood of our soilders and <HI>fellow citizens</HI> must be ascribed to the interposition of that kind providence, which has manifestly appeared in our behalf, through this important struggle:" That General Howe and his men should so precipitantly and in an apparent panic evacuate Boston is truly astonishing. In like manner the enemies of GOD'S people were terrified and fled of of old, according to the word of the LORD.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="014675_0021_0F948B9A79D8EDF0"/>
THE success of the continental fleet at <HI>New-Provi∣dence,</HI> where they took considerable warlike stores, and in their return some vessels of force, demands our sin∣cerest gratitude to the LORD of HOSTS.</P>
<P>WE need not enlarge on these particulars, which are fresh in every one's memory now, and in the history of America, will astonish posterity.</P>
<P>WONDERFUL is the union subsisting in the Ameri∣can <HI>States:</HI> Yet in <HI>North-Carolina,</HI> by some lately set∣tled there, and others deluded and infatuated, a sordid insurrection was not long since formed. This was speedily and remarkably crushed; their General, (<HI>M' Donald</HI>) captivated; their commander in the engagement (<HI>M'Cloud</HI>) killed; of the rest, some were killed, some taken, and others dispersed: Some of their ring-leaders are confined, and 'tis apprehended, all the rest are disarmed. In this affray, only two men on our side were wounded, one of them mortally, though the conspirators who attacked our men, were almost double their number, if not more. But yet our enemies are practising every artifice to seduce and destroy us. Are not all our rights and liberties, civil and sacred, and therein the rights of the constitution, invaded and threatened? <HI>British</HI> troops are sent to subjugate us—fleets to annoy and ruin us, lining our sea-coasts—plundering the inha∣bitants—butchering our friends—endeavouring with fire and sword, to make our pleasant places desolate. With what impotent rage, do the tools of tyranny pant for our blood! With what amazing ardour do they le∣vel the arrows of their vengeance against every thing dear and sacred to us, even those very privileges CHRIST purchased for us and commands us to defend! Can Britons, who have been a terror to tyrants, fight suc∣cessfully under the banners of tyranny, against the
<PB N="23" REF="014675_0022_0F948B9AE5FD6EF0"/>
of Heaven! Can their swords retain their edge or their arms their accustomed vigour! It is very remarka∣ble, that so small a number of our men have been slain in the various skirmishes hitherto: In some of which our men have been imminently exposed, to all human ap∣pearance, and not one killed. This is the LORD'S do∣ing, and marvellous in our eyes! It is apprehended, Heaven hath not suffered one ball in a thousand, which they have levelled against us, to do any execution.</P>
<P>WE must be greatly wanting to ourselves, to poste∣rity, to our country and to our GOD, if we do not ex∣ert ourselves to maintain our rights. The public wel∣fare, demand the attention of all, in their respective de∣partments, to inspire and invigorate their best efforts for its advancement; and especially those in public trust; that with inextinguishable ardour, they pursue the pub∣lic good. In any member of society a selfish, narrow, contracted temper is criminal: But in those of public character 'tis odious, and under our present circum∣stances, unsufferable.</P>
<P>A LATE writer in England observes, <Q>The nation in general look on the struggle, between the colonies, in defence of their rights and freedom, and the arbitra∣ry power which would enslave them, in a very inte∣resting point of view. They consider American free∣dom as the palladium of their own. Many there∣fore wish for your firmness, perseverance and suc∣cess. America is considered as an asylum from op∣pression. If you preserve your constitutional rights and liberties, you may depend upon it, that people, arts and manufactures will flock to you from all parts of the globe. Riches and power will follow of course. Take care that you do not fall into the vices, luxury and oppression, which have brought destruction to all former great states and kingdoms, and now threaten
<PB N="24" REF="014675_0023_0F948B9D4ABF4820"/>
the like to <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> Consider the importance of the parts you are now to act. The freedom and hap∣piness of yourselves, your posterity, of the whole Bri∣tish empire, and the oppressed of all nations seems to depend upon you. Think! O think what should be your conduct where a charge of such consequence devolves upon you! Providence hath placed you in a most important station, see that you discharge the du∣ties of it, with faithfulness and dignity.</Q></P>
<P>THE Bishop of ST. ASAPH, in his sermon before the society, &amp;c. holds up to view the future greatness and glory of America, instead of representing us as savages and barbarians, which had been too common upon that occasion. In his Lordship's patriotic speech in favour of BOSTON's charter, he observes, <Q>arbitrary taxation is plunder authorized by law. It is the support and essence of tyranny, and has done more mischief to mankind, than those other three scourges from Hea∣ven, sword, pestilence and famine. In whatever hands the power of taxation is lodged, it includes and implies all other power. He adds, my Lords, I have ventur∣ed to lay my thoughts before you, on the greatest na∣tional concern that ever came under your deliberation, with as much honesty as you will find from others, and with a melancholy assurance that not a word of it will be regarded. And yet, my Lords, by your permission, I will waste one short argument more on the same cause. My Lords, I look on America as the only great nursery of freemen now left upon the face of the earth. The most precious remains of civil liberty the world can now boast of, are now lodged in our hands; and GOD forbid that we should violate so sacred a deposit. By enslaving the colonies, you not only ruin the peace, the commerce and fortunes of both countries, but you extinguish the fairest hopes, shut up the last asylum of mankind. I think, my
<PB N="25" REF="014675_0024_0F948B9E4D081328"/>
Lords, without being weakly superstituous, a good man may hope that heaven will take part against the execution of a plan which seems big, not only with mischief, but impiety. In which hope we all most cordially unite.</Q> <HI>Hath not Heaven as yet, answered the pious wish?</HI></P>
<P>IN addition to what is before mentioned, we may here add, that in the encounters at Noddles and Hog-Islands, and in one more lately at Georgia, we lost not a man, though imminently exposed.</P>
<P>DID not Heaven also most apparently take part a∣gainst them when it consumed some of their vessels by lightning: and when a terrible storm destroyed much of their shipping on the banks of Newfoundland, with the treasures they had taken out of the seas, where we had been prohibited fishing—many men lost their lives, (some say above three thousand) who, it is confidently affirmed were to have come against us, when the season for fishing was over. GOD immediately interposed, and prevented them. Besides, the colonies are surprizingly united, considering the methods that have been used to divide and destroy. What Union and resolution have our provincial assemblies and conventions mani∣fested! How wonderfully has the spirit of wisdom, love, peace, goodness, unanimity, and fortitude inspir∣ed the grand American Congress! To their resolves, the people have yielded remarkable obedience. In all which GOD is to be acknowledged; and while the propect bright∣ens before us, our obligations to support our rights are in∣reased. Under the Jewish Theocracy, GOD destroyed those who were intimidated, and discouraged their brethren.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Numb.</HI> 13 <HI>and</HI> 14 <HI>chap.</HI></NOTE> We may be sorely chastised, but the righteous cause, so dearly purchased, will prevail. The LORD of HOSTS
<PB N="26" REF="014675_0025_0F948BA0ED2EDD30"/>
will arm the whole creation—level the artillery of Hea∣ven—send all his angels, and martial all the elements in battle array, against his enemies, before his cause shall suffer.</P>
<P>MANY remarks that might be made, must be sup∣pressed, and the subject closed with some addresses.</P>
<P>FIRST. To the legislature of this colony now con∣vened.</P>
<P>MAY it please your HONOR, the honorable COUNCIL, and REPRESENTATIVES, in General Court assembled:</P>
<P>IN this dark and difficult day, you will consider yourselves as the guardians of our excellent constituti∣on, which has true English liberty for its basis. Nor can it fail of giving you singular consolation, that (under GOD) you hold these places of public trust and honor, by the spontaneous suffrages of a free people. You will ever bear in mind, that wisdom, prudence, courage and for∣titude, a public and patriotic spirit (which on this oc∣casion have so often been recommended) with the true fear of GOD in your hearts, are essential qualifications for civil rulers—Religion inspires the mind with forti∣tude—makes it truly great, and in scripture, always forms a principal part of the good ruler's character. <HI>The fear of the</HI> LORD <HI>is the beginning</HI> and perfection <HI>of wisdom.</HI> It wou'd be most absurd for the ministers of GOD not to revere the Almighty. Therefore, you will consider yourselves as under peculiar obligations to ex∣emplify religion. To promote virtue, example is more efficacious than human laws. While you show your∣selves the noble patrons of christian liberty, you will patronize learning by all due encouragements.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="014675_0026_0F948BA184AF7A68"/>
HONORED SENATORS,</P>
<P>MATTERS of last importance are upon the very point of decision. The appeal is made to Heaven. When you are called to deliberations and determinations of most universal concern, may GOD grant you all that wisdom, grace, firmness and magnanimity you need. When the fate of millions now existing, and innumera∣ble multitudes yet unborn is depending, this counsel of heaven cannot be unseasonable, <HI>Stand fast in the liber∣ty wherewith Christ hath made us free.</HI> The distinguish∣ing favour of Heaven to this colony, in giving us a Governor firmly attached to, and with unremitted zeal, integrity and magnanimity, promoting of the public in∣terest, is most gratefully acknowledged, whom GOD hath mercifully supported, under the greatest burthen of cares, and most urgent multiplicity of the most im∣portant business, that ever any Governor was called unto in this colony.</P>
<P>THIS is the only provincial, General Assembly upon this continent which hath not been harrassed and per∣plex'd by being adjourned, prorogued or dissolved by its Governor, except one, which was necessitated to ap∣point a new one.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rhode-Island colony was reduced to this necessity last year.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>GENTLEMEN,</P>
<P>WAS it ever of equal necessity and importance that our civil and military officers be known friends to their country. Your eyes will be upon the faithful of the land to sustain every office you are entrusted to bestow. You will never suffer our precious privileges, so dear∣ly purchased and transmitted, to be lost by your neglect. Should you sink with the weight of the community up∣on your shoulders, O! how dreadful.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="014675_0027_0F948BA2378E1390"/>
WE look to you to consult measures necessary to per∣petuate our liberty. Trusting in GOD, you will exert your∣selves to suppress iniquity, and be strong—show yourselves men; not tarnishing the dignity of your characters, but standing fast in the cause of GOD and your country. This will embalm your memories. Future generations, as well as the present, will call you blessed. But a little while and the place which now knows you, will know you no more. You will be animated to duty from the consideration of your approaching dissolution. Several of those who, not long since were seated at the council board, are now consigned to the gloomy recesses of the dead.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The honorable</HI> EBENEZER SILLIMAN, <ABBR><HI>Esq</HI></ABBR> <HI>the honorable</HI> SHU∣BAEL CONANT, <ABBR><HI>Esq</HI></ABBR> <HI>the honorable</HI> JAMES-ABRAHAM HILLHOUSE, <ABBR><HI>Esq</HI></ABBR> <HI>who deceased the year past.</HI></NOTE> Honorable counsellors and judges must die as well as others. Those who (through grace) act their parts well, while living, shall be rever'd and admir'd by men, and when they die, be applauded by Heaven. Then may you exchange your seats in this senate for mansions of glory.</P>
<P>SECONDLY. To our honorable GENERALS, COLONELS, and other OFFICERS in our armies.</P>
<P>HONORED GENTLEMEN,</P>
<P>THE LORD of HOSTS hath raised you up and called you to most important services. Your country reposes the highest confidence (under GOD) in your wisdom, prudence, martial skill, intrepid courage and heroic valour. GOD hath stiled himself <HI>a man of war.</HI> CHRIST, <HI>the Captain of</HI> GOD'S <HI>host.</HI> Under his banner the people that do know their GOD, shall do exploits. You will therefore endeavour to promote the knowledge of, love and obedience unto, and entire trust in GOD. As you are engaged, not on∣ly
<PB N="29" REF="014675_0028_0F948BA2F2DC5708"/>
in a most just but glorious cause; <HI>be strong and very couragious. Play the men for the church and city of our God; and the</HI> LORD <HI>do what seemeth him good. The battle is not your's, but the</HI> LORD'S. Should any of you die, fighting in defence of your country's rights, you will expire in a full blaze of glory.</P>
<P>IN testimony of our great regard for such illustrious worthies, we this day, with deepest lamentations, pour forth our tears over the urns of the brave, the gallant and heroic WARREN and MONTGOMERY. America la∣ments their fall.</P>
<P>GENTLEMEN, we wish you a blessing from the house of the LORD. GOD ALMIGHTY crown your military enterprizes with success; and after you have been the happy instruments, in GOD'S hand, of saving your country, may you, in some late period, receive distin∣guished honors in the celestial state of uninterrupted peace.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, To my FATHERS and BRETHREN in the GOSPEL MINISTRY.</P>
<P>REVEREND AND BELOVED,</P>
<P>NOT only as men, but as ministers, we are peculiarly interested in the event of the present controversy. You will allow me to <HI>stir up your pure minds, by putting you in remembrance.</HI> We must watch for souls, as those that must give account; and wo to us if they are lost by our neglect. As we are to carry into execution the glorious designs of sinner's salvation, what blessed, ani∣mating prospects are disclosed, when all the glories and dreadfuls of the eternal worlds rise up to view! Faith, repentance, and universal reformation, are to be incul∣cated; the whole counsel of GOD must be delivered, and all be enforced by a Christlike example, which adds greatest weight to council, edge to reproof, and efficacy to admonitions. While we openly bear testimony against
<PB N="30" REF="014675_0029_0F948BA3CABDE0C0"/>
oppression, how solicitous should we be, that no disposition lurk within us, to <HI>lord it over God's heritage.</HI> Warning a∣gainst those vices which have subjugated mighty nations, we must carefully avoid them ourselves; otherwise our warnings will rebound with amazing confusion, into our own faces. Who knows what scenes may be approaching▪ we may be called to the fiery tryal. Let us now sound the alarm, that saints may be quicken'd, and sinners, having the sentence of death in themselves, be excited to fly to the living GOD.</P>
<P>VERY soon must we give an account of our stewardship to our eternal JUDGE. Of this, Heaven loudly premo∣nishes us, by the late frequent deaths of our venerable fathers and brethren in the ministry,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The Rev. Messieurs</HI> WILLIAMS, D. D. MILLS, HALL, BARTHO∣LOMEW, ROBERTS, BROWN, CLARK, HEART, <HI>and</HI> HOWE: <HI>all who deceased since the last election.</HI></NOTE> whose praise is in the churches. With what incessant importunity should we address the GOD of grace, for ourselves, our people and our country, at the present day. May we obtain grace to be faithful, and mercy to be successful labourers in GOD'S vineyard. And when CHRIST, the Chief Shepherd, shall appear, may we and our respective flocks appear with him in glory.</P>
<P>THIS discourse closes, with an address to this numer∣ous assembly.</P>
<P>RESPECTABLE AUDIENCE:</P>
<P>THE time is short—eternity near, and your work great to prepare therefor. <HI>We are ambassadors for</HI> CHRIST, <HI>as though</HI> GOD <HI>did beseech you by us: We pray you, in</HI> CHRIST'S <HI>stead, be ye reconciled to</HI> GOD. For conscience sake, yield all due obedience to civil magistracy, which is perfectly consistent with standing fast in our liberty. Improve the best of privileges to the noblest purposes. Think nothing too dear to be parted with in support of them. If a people, under all our peculiar advantages, and con∣straining
<PB N="31" REF="014675_0030_0F948BA46FE8A600"/>
motives, to holiness can find in their hearts to indulge all manner of iniquities, their destruction is has∣tening. <HI>Is not destruction to the wicked, and a strange pu∣nishment to the workers of iniquity?</HI> GOD <HI>will rain upon them fire and brimstone and an horrible tempest.</HI> The times call for deepest humiliation, frequent fasting, and most ar∣dent prayer. Our land is sacrilegiously polluted with the blood of our fellow citizens, impiously shed by worse than savage hands. We are involved in the horrors of a civil war. Let your heads, hands, fortunes and lives be devoted and consecrated to your country's good. When our host goeth forth, against the most unnatural enemy, let us keep ourselves from every wicked thing, as we would not pull down Heaven's vengeance upon the land, and those who defend the common cause. Let us cry mightily to GOD, and be careful to engage JESUS to be our <HI>Captain-General.</HI></P>
<P>FOR Heaven's sake and for our own, let us arouse, my countrymen, and act up to the dignity of our cha∣racter as free-born Americans. Let us be steady, pru∣dent, firm and united, trusting in the LORD. Now, by the love of GOD to perishing sinners—by all that CHRIST hath done and suffered to purchase our privi∣leges and eternal salvation—by the worth of your own precious and immortal souls—by all that is dear and sacred—by all your regard to the sacred Trinity, to yourselves, to posterity, and to your country, we be∣seech and adjure you to <HI>Stand fast in the liberty wherewith</HI> CHRIST <HI>hath made us free.</HI></P>
