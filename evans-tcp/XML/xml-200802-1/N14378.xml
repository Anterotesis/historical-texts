<HEAD>A PRACTICAL ESSAY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART I. To HUSBANDS and WIVES.</HEAD>
<P>THE words of the apostle, in <HI>Ephesians</HI> v. 32. "this is a great mistery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church," naturally lead to two inquiries.</P>
<P N="1">1st. What is the most obvious meaning of the word church in the scriptures?</P>
<P N="2">2d. How doth the marriage union convey, as in a mis∣tery, the union of Christ and the church?</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<P>For the most obvious meaning of the word church in the scriptures, we may look into the various texts where it is mentioned.</P>
<P>I do not recollect that the word is any where used in the old testament. The apostle, in <HI>Acts</HI> vii. 38. uses it for the old testament church, "this is he that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel," &amp;c. The words that are used in the old testament are assembly and congregation; <HI>Exodus</HI> xii. 6. "the whole assembly shall kill it in the evening," that is, the whole church of Israel that were bound to keep the passover; <HI>Psalm</HI> xxii. 22. "In the midst of the congregation will I praise thee," which the apostle, in <HI>Hebrews</HI> ii. 12. calls the church, "in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee."</P>
<P>In the new testament, the first mentioned place I recol∣lect, is <HI>Matthew</HI> xvi. 18. "upon this rock will I build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it." Upon this rock the truth Peter had made confession of, "thou art the Christ, the son of the living God," is the
<PB N="4" REF="018214_0003_0FA5C1A173AE4150"/>
rock on which the church is built, against which the gates, the power and policy of hell, shall not prevail.</P>
<P>Then in the 18th of <HI>Matthew,</HI> 17. in which, so far as I understand, Jesus Christ is instructing his disciples their duty in their particular connection, those believers of of the apostles doctrine collected in the profession of of the name of Jesus, meeting together in one place, was called the church in that place. In <HI>Acts</HI> viii. 1. we read of the church which was at Jerusalem, the first church gathered by the apostles after the descent of the Holy Ghost; <HI>Acts</HI> xiii. 1. of the church at Antioch; <HI>Acts</HI> xx. 7. and <HI>Revelations</HI> ii. 1. of the church of Ephesus; <HI>Romans</HI> xvi. 3 5. and 1st of <HI>Corinthians,</HI> xvi. 19. we read of the church in the house of Priscilla and Aquilla; in <HI>Collosians</HI> iv. 15. of the church in Nymphas's house, and of the church in Philemon's house, in the 2d verse of that epistle.</P>
<P>These particular churches, gathered by the apostles doctrine, was governed by the will of Jesus Christ, as taught by them; and so far as that can be understood from the scriptures, are the rule by which particular churches of Christ are to be governed in all ages; but as that would be too lengthy to be here considered, must be passed over.</P>
<P>We read also of the church of the first born, written in heaven, <HI>Hebrews,</HI> xii. 23; of the church for which Christ gave himself, "that he might sanctify and cleanse it, by the washing of water through the word, that he might make it to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, but that it might be holy and without blemish." <HI>Ephesians</HI> v. 26. 27.</P>
<P>Hence I collect, 1st. That Jesus Christ is the founda∣tion on whom the church is built.</P>
<P>2d. That those that were brought by the apostolick doc∣trine concerning him, to believe that Jesus is the Christ. in the first ages of christianity, were by apostolick authority collected into distinct, particular churches, in such places where there were a sufficient number of believers for that purpose, and were called the church in that place. There is little said about the place of their meeting: I suppose any place that they could obtain, that was convenient for
<PB N="5" REF="018214_0004_0FA5C1A2341EC9E8"/>
that purpose: The church of Troas met in an upper cham∣ber; <HI>Acts</HI> xx. 7. 8. the church of the Collosians in Phile∣mon's house, as may be seen by comparing those two epistles.</P>
<P>These churches appeared as a representation of the uni∣versal church, in their holding the one truth, that Jesus Christ is the son of God, by which they were all gathered together, this being the sole foundation on which the universal church is built, and in their professed subjection to the authority of Jesus Christ, the head of the church, and head over all things for its good.</P>
<P>3dly. That there is a universal church, which will con∣sist of all that are included in that glorious church for whom Jesus Christ gave himself; the full meaning of which is the general assembly and church of the first born, written in heaven; Jesus Christ is the first born among the many brethren brought to glory. <HI>Psalm</HI> lxxxix. 27. "I will make him my first born, higher than the kings of the earth;" <HI>Romans</HI> viii. 29. "the first born among many bre∣thren;" <HI>Collosians</HI> i. 15. "who is the first born of every creature,"—verse 18. "the first born from the dead." It is his church the church of the first born; this church, this general assembly, called <HI>Psalm</HI> cvii. 32. "the assembly of the people, the congregation of the elders," <HI>Psalm</HI> cxi. 1. "the assembly of the upright, and the congregation," <HI>Psalm</HI> clxix. 1. "the congregation of the saints," that are represented to John, <HI>Revelations</HI> v. 8. by the four living creatures and four and twenty elders, and chap. vii. 9. by a great multitude, which no man could number, of all na∣tions and kindred, and people and tongues, in addition to the hundred, forty and four thousand, that were sealed in the former part of the chapter▪ of all the tribes of Israel. The same sealed number are represented, in chap. xiv. 1. to 5. "standing with the lamb on the mount Zion," which did not exclude the preaching of the gospel to every na∣tion and kindred and tongue and people, verse 6; which gospel or word shall not return void, but shall accomplish what he pleases, and shall prosper in the thing where unto he sends it.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="018214_0005_0FA5C1A32F10D7E8"/>
Of this church every believer of the apostles testimony, or every one that believeth that Jesus is the Christ, accord∣ing to Peter's confession, appears▪ upon the confession of this faith, to be a visible member. And it is the duty of every such person, who can find a particular church built on this foundation, and who in subjection to his authority make the apostolick churches their rule as to order, to join with them in the profession of his name, with them observ∣ing all things whatsoever he has commanded, walking to∣gether in love, as he hath given commandment; for this they are chosen and called to the faith of the gospel, 1st of <HI>Peter,</HI> ii. 9. Such are made use of for the ingathering of others. 1st of <HI>Thessalonians,</HI> 1. 8. "for from you founded out the word of the Lord;" <HI>Ephesians</HI> i. 9. 10. "having made known to us the mistery of his will, according to his good pleasure, which he hath proposed in himself, that in the dispensation of the fullness of times, he might gather to∣gether in one all things in Christ, both which are in hea∣ven and which are on earth, in him." But the Ephesian church being chosen in him before the foundation of the world, to be holy and without blame before him in love, being predestinated to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace, was not to the final exclu∣sion or reprobation of others, but as a means made use of by him, that in the dispensation of the fullness of times, he might gather together all things in Christ; chap. ii 7. "that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus." The church then is to hold forth the word of life; the word is to sound out from them. "As oft as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do shew forth the Lord's death till he come:" Thus they boldly bear his name, in opposition to earth and hell; shew that he is pre∣cious, and hold forth to the world, that there is no other name under heaven given among men, whereby they must be saved. Such are the means the great head of the church makes use of, as he pleases, to the conviction of others: But be the consequences what they will, it is their
<PB N="7" REF="018214_0006_0FA5C1A6CF23F230"/>
duty to testify to his name, truth and ways, looking for the time when he will gather all the fruit of his purchase into one in himself; for every one for whom Christ died, shall certainly, in his time and way, come to the know∣ledge of him, and to partake in his salvation, as those who have been or are visible members of his church.—For doth not the scriptures shew the connection of the hu∣man race with Jesus Christ, as their head, in as exten∣sive a view as their connection with the first Adam, see <HI>Romans</HI> 5, 14, to the end; <HI>Hebrews</HI> ii. 9. "we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the sufferings of death, crowned with glory and honor, that he by the grace of God, should taste death for every man." 1st. of <HI>John,</HI> ii. 2. "he is the propitiation for our sin; and not for ours only, but for the whole world." And the apostle says, 2d. of <HI>Corinthians,</HI> v. 14. to the end, "we thus judge, if one died for all, then all died; and he died for all, that they which live, should not henceforth live to themselves, but to him that died for them, and rose again." This appears to be the design of the manifestation of this truth, or of persons being brought to the knowledge of the truth, and to life in Christ thereby, that they which live should not henceforth live to themselves, but to him that died for them, and rose again;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The thought of this is enough to croath wish shame, as a garment, those who have hope of life by Jesus Christ, that this design has been no more attended to. For myself I can say, to me belongs shame and con∣fusion of f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce. Praised be his name, to the Lord our God belongs mercies and so givness.—Though we have rebelled against him, may the hope of forgivness ever keep us from despair, and be a flesh spring of exci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ement to live to him that died for us, and rose again.</NOTE> verse 16. "wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh;" before they knew the Jews after the flesh, as those "to whom pertained the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giv∣ing of the law, and the service, and the promises, whose were the fathers and of whom concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen."</P>
<P>The gospel was first published to them, beginning at Je∣rusalem; upon their rejecting it, the apostles are sent
<PB N="8" REF="018214_0007_0FA5C1A915808C10"/>
to the Gentiles, and are taught to call no man com∣mon or unclean; what God hath sanctified, call not thou common, which the apostle explains, <HI>Acts</HI> x. 28. "God hath shewed that I should call no man common or un∣clean." Why? Because God hath sanctified them; I view them sanctified, in that Christ died for all, and designs in his time and way to bring them all to the knowledge of himself, and manifest his sanctifying and setting them apart for himself. This destroys all distinction between Jew and Gentile, and not only as the nations of Jews and Gentiles, but of all men in every age, that on some account or other, besides the atonement, would presume to be in, or near, or have a claim upon the divine favour before some of their fellow creatures. Henceforth know we no man after the flesh, "yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more;" Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision, was made under the law, fulfilled the righteousness of it, came to his own, sent his gospel first to the Jews; but when his death and resur∣rection were fully made manifest, and the premises under∣stood, that all the families of the earth were to be blessed in him, that the Gentiles were to glorify God for mercy; when these things were mad, fully manifest, the apostle says, "yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more; therefore if any man be in Christ a new creature, these old things are passed away, behold all things are become new." There is not a fragment of the old dispensation or of the righte∣ousness of our own, can have any admission as recommend∣ing us to the divine favour, "all things are become new. and all of God, who hath reconciled us to himself," us, the apostles and first disciples, with the church of the Corinthians, to whom he wrote, who were together visibly reconciled to himself by Jesus Christ, "and hath committed to us the word of reconcilation;" that is, the word of reconciliation committed to the apostles, "that God was in Christ re∣conciling the world to himself; not imputing their tres∣passes unto them." Now then, if God was in Christ re∣conciling the world unto himself; if he be the propitiation
<PB N="9" REF="018214_0008_0FA5C1AA931C5968"/>

for the whole world; if he tasted death for every man; if Adam was a full figure of him that was to come, and the connection of the human race with Jesus Christ as their head as extensive as their connection with the first Adam, then we must conceive that the church of the first born, the church for which Christ gave himself, will finally consist of all nations, kindreds, tongues and people; and in this view, the design of mercy for bids, calling any man com∣mon, and lays a sure foundation of universal love and be∣nevolence to all the human race, and of faith in prayer for them; while those brought to believe that Jesus is the Christ, professing their faith in, and subjection to him, and appearing influenced thereby, are subjects of that gospel charity which the apostle enjoins, when he says, "have fervent charity among yourselves," and which I think appears evidently distinguishable from the univer∣sal benevolence due to the whole human race.</P>
<P>Thus from the most obvious meaning of the passages where the word church is used in scripture, these things have been collected. 1st, That Jesus Christ is the foun∣dation on which the church is built. 2dly, A collection of believers professing his name, and in subjection to his authority observing his laws, in any place, are a visible church there, or a visible representation of the univer∣sal church. 3dly. The universal church will finally have gathered into it, or be made up of all for whom Christ died.</P>
<P>The second inquiry is, How doth marriage convey, as in a mistery, the union of Christ and the church?</P>
<P>Attention to this inquiry will lead us to compare this passage in <HI>Ephesians,</HI> with the beginning of <HI>Genesis,</HI> and various other passages, one with another. In <HI>Genesis</HI> i. 27. we read, "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him, male and female created he them." There appeared to be male and female created in the one man: The particular formation of building of the woman was from man, of which we have the account, <HI>Genesis</HI> ii. 21. 22. "And the Lord God caused a deep sleep
<PB N="10" REF="018214_0009_0FA5C1AB3597B618"/>
to fall upon Adam, and he slept<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As Adam was a figure of him that was to come, may not this deep sleep prefigure the death of Jesus Christ, from which the church arises.</NOTE>; and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof; and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man, builded<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the Hebrew in the bible margin.</NOTE> he a woman, and brought her unto the man." Thus the woman "is of the man, and for the man," 1st of <HI>Corin∣thians,</HI> xi. 8. 9. So is the church, in every view, of and for Jesus Christ. <HI>Romans</HI> xi. 36. "for of him, and to him, and through him, are all things." <HI>Collosians</HI> i. 16. "all things were created by him and for him." As the woman was created in him, was of him and for him, so they are called by one name, or she bears his name. <HI>Ge∣nesis</HI> v. 2. "male and female created he them, and called their name Adam." When she was brought to him, he says, "she shall be called woman, because she was taken out of man." She shall be called by a name derived from that of man. So the church is called by the same name with Jesus Christ; <HI>Jeremiah</HI> xxiii. 6. and xxxiii. 16. "he and she are called, the Lord our righteousness." Yet, so as to be denominated from him, "he shall be called a Nazarene," they "the sect of the Nazarenes;" he is call∣ed Christ, "the disciples were first called Christians at Antioch;" names derived from him, shewing that with∣out him they were nothing; that he is their all, and that in him they possess and enjoy all good.</P>
<P>We have the reason of this name, "This is now bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called wo∣man because she was taken out of man." "So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies; he that loveth his wife loveth himself, for no man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church, for we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones." The circumstances of the church with Jesus Christ, are similar to that of Adam with his wife, bone and flesh. "For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and be joined to his wife, and they two shall be
<PB N="11" REF="018214_0010_0FA5C1AC02A69E90"/>
one flesh: This is a great mistery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church."</P>
<P>"This is a great mistery;" the mistery, that in marriage conveys the union of Christ and the church, appears herein: That the woman was created in the man, was united to him before she was distinctly builded a woman: When she was thus builded and brought to him, there appeared the visible marriage union; he said, "this is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh." "Therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife." Therefore, because of the previous union that was the ground of it, "but I speak," says the apostle, "con∣cerning Christ and the church," this holds forth the union between Christ and the church, prior to the visible mar∣riage union which takes place upon any of the children of men being brought to Jesus Christ, who says, "for no man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me, draw him."</P>
<P>In <HI>Romans</HI> xvi. 7. Andronicus and Junia are spoke of as in Christ before the apostle, though they were together chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world. Thus is the whole church in Christ, in the most universal sense: He stands answering fully to the figure of him that was to come, the head of every man, a universally as Adam was. In this view there is a union or connection of head and members, even before the members actually appear. "And for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and cleave to his wife." Jesus Christ left father and mother in cleaving to his wife; <HI>John</HI> xvi 18. "I came forth of the father, and am come into the world." In <HI>Matthew</HI> xii. 47. to 50. and <HI>Mark</HI> iii. 32. to 35. his attention to what he had to do for his church, was not diverted by his mo∣ther.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Is he not the true an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. o. Levi? <HI>Dueteronomy</HI> XXXIII. 8. 9.</NOTE> Jesus Christ took her circumstances as his own; took her debts upon himself; undertook to look after her when lost; and in pursuance of his undertaking, gave his life for her. "Even as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it," she wears his name, is compleat in him,
<PB N="12" REF="018214_0011_0FA5C1ACB51AF0B0"/>
"who of God is made unto her wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and redemption." It is visibly so with respect to those that are brought by the gospel to the knowledge of, faith in, and subjection to him: It was really so in the purpose and purchase of Jesus Christ, before they came to the knowledge of him, and is really so respecting those who yet know him not, live in unbelief and disobedience; for, says the apostle, <HI>Hebrews</HI> ii. 8. "then hath put all things in subjection under his feet; for in that he put all in subjection, he left nothing not put under him; but now we see not yet all things put under him: But we see Je∣sus for the sufferings of death crowned with glory and ho∣nor, that he, by the grace of God, should taste death for every man." And the prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> gives us the divine oath for this, chap. xlv. 22. "Look unto me," (the just God and the Saviour) "and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth, for I God and none else; I have sworne by my∣self, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, that to me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear, surely shall say, in the Lord have I righteousness and strength, to him shall come;" which must make all that are incensed against him ashamed.</P>
<P>The name of the visible church is, "the Lord our righteousness." All that are brought to him call him so, and are denominated by it, "'tis the name whereby she shall be called." But we have the divine oath, that "every knee shall bow, and every tongue shall swear, surely shall say, in the Lord have I righteousness and strength." The time and manner is with him, who saith, "I will work and who shall let it;" "who will have all men to be sav∣ed and come to the knowledge of the truth; for there is one God, even one mediator, of God and man, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testi∣fied in due time."</P>
<P>In Christ Jesus, God manifest in the flesh, we have the fullness of the divine nature, as i. e. pressed in <HI>Hebrews</HI> i. 3. "who being the brightness of glory and the express image of his person." <HI>Collosians</HI> ii. 9. "for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily;" who could say, "I and Father are one."</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="018214_0012_0FA5C1AD74F9C098"/>
Is there not the fullness of the human nature also in him? The apostle says, "we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones," Who does he mean? Doubt∣less the church, the apostles, the first disciples, the church of the Ephesians, who were visibly so, and those who should believe through their word, in every age; yea, all for whom Jesus Christ gave himself. The church, in the most extensive sense, are in this union, and are represented tra∣veling together in pun, till the manifestation of it. <HI>Romans</HI> viii. 22. "for we know that the whole creation," it is the same word we have in <HI>Mark</HI> xvi 15. "preach the gospel to every creature;" therefore every creature that the gospel is to be preached to, "groaneth and traveleth in pain together; and not only they, but we ourselves that have the first fruits, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body." By the redemption of our body, I conceive the idea of the body of which Jesus is the head, as captivated, enslav∣ed, sold, and groaning under this bondage; and those whose minds have been led to an understanding of re∣demption by Christ, though their minds are thereby re∣lieved, yet groaning, waiting for the adoption, the re∣demption of the whole body.</P>
<P>Now that in Jesus Christ there is the fullness of the hu∣man nature, is it not evident from the consideration of <HI>Ge∣nesis</HI> v. 2. where we read of our first parents in their primi∣tive state, "male and female created he them, and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day they were created." Whom he blesses are blessed; for his gifts are without repentance. So when we have the account of their being seduced from their allegiance, brought under bondage, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed captive by satan, the curse is denounced upon the serpent, <HI>Genesis</HI> iii 4; but the way opened through which the original blessedness. pronounced in the day they were created, should be accomplished, verse 15, although they could not sin without smart and sorrow; to the woman. "I will greatly multiply thy sorrow; in sorrow shal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thou bri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g forth children." &amp;c—to the man, "cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shall
<PB N="14" REF="018214_0013_0FA5C1AE36B91C08"/>
thou eat it all the days of thy life," &amp;c. And as the way in which the original blessing that was forfeited was to be restored and confirmed, was brought to view in the 15th verse; so it is repeated and illustrated in <HI>Genesis</HI> xii. 3. xviii. 18. xxii. 18. and xxvi. 4. "In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed." This the apostles calls "preaching the gospel to Abraham," <HI>Gallations</HI> iii. 18. 'Tis agreeable to <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> xxxii. 43. "rejoice, O ye nations, his people;" <HI>Psalm</HI> lxxii. 11. "all nations shall serve him," verse 17. "all nations shall call him blessed;" <HI>Psalm</HI> lxxxii. 8. "arise O God, for thou shalt inherit all nations;" <HI>Psalm</HI> ii. 8. "ask of me, and I will give the heathen thine inheritance, and the utmost parts of the earth thy possession;" <HI>Psalm</HI> lxxxvi. 9. "all nations shall come and worship before thee, and glorify thy name." <HI>Psalm</HI> c. all the earth are called upon to make a joyful noise to the Lord, on account of his making us his people and the sheep of his pasture: "Know ye." Who is to know? Answer, all the earth. "Know ye that the Lord, he GOD,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I read this verse without the words supplied by the translators.</NOTE> he hath made us, and not we ourselves, his people and the sheep of his pasture." Agreeable to <HI>Psalm</HI> cxvii. "O praise the Lord." Who? "All ye na∣tions; praise him all ye people." Where are any exempt∣ed? "For his merciful kindness is great towards us." Towards who? All the earth, as extensive as the call to praise him. "And the truth of the Lord forever; praise ye the LORD." His merciful kindness; how is the greatness of it made manifest, and how doth the truth of the Lord appear to endure forever, but in him "who is the mercy and the truth," in him "in whom all nations are blessed," in him "in whom thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob and the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn to our fathers in the days of old.</P>
<P>Now this blessedness of the nations, of which these passages speak, was to have its accomplishment in the seed of Abraham, "In thy seed;" which is Christ. <HI>Gallations</HI> iii. 6. Now if all the nations of the earth are included in the
<PB N="15" REF="018214_0014_0FA5C1AF2C51A078"/>
blessedness in Christ Jesus, they are in him as their head; there is the fullness of the human nature in Christ Jesus; so they were considered in him before the evidences of it appeared in or upon any of them; and because of this union, he is engaged in all the doth for them, to bring them to himself. "This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my felsh; she shall be called woman because she was taken cut of man." "Therefore," because of the pre∣vious union, "shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife, and they shall be one flesh: This is a great mistery, but," says the apostle, "I speak concerning Christ and the church." "This is now bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman;" she shall wear my name, come into a visible connection and intercourse with me, be interested in what I am and have, &amp;c. So in consequence of this union shall the church, in the most extensive sense, even every member, from all the ends of the earth, be brought to Jesus Christ, in his times, who is the blessed and only potentate; shall bear his name; be called by the name which the mouth of the Lord doth name: 'Tis by his authority we are assured, she shall be called "the Lord our righteousness." These things shall be made manifest when <HI>Psalm</HI> xlv. 15. 15. and <HI>Psalm</HI> lxxii. from the 9th to the end of the 15th verse, have their ac∣complishment.</P>
<P>Against what has been brought to view, particularly in the several quotations from the Psalms, arises this objec∣tion, that the apostle appears to apply such passages to those gathered by the gospel from the among the Gentiles; not to the Gentiles in so extensive a manner as is expressed in the Psalms; and so those passages are to be understood in the limited sense used by the apostles, who direct their epistles to the believers of their testimony, collected from among the Gentiles.</P>
<P>To this it may be answered, that the epistles of the apostles were wrote to visible churches, and visible believers, for their express direction in their conduct towards God and one another, and are left on record for the same end, to all believers in all ages, as none but such as are led to the
<PB N="16" REF="018214_0015_0FA5C1B2D657B618"/>
knowledge of Jesus Christ, were capable of understanding the grace there made manifest, and the obligations thence arising to glorify him in their spirits and bodies which are his; but yet it is evident they were designed as a means of communication of the knowledge of Christ to mankind in general. See <HI>Ephesians</HI> i. 9. 10.</P>
<P><HI>Ephesians</HI> ii. 4 to 7. "But God who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he hath loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, and hath raised us up together and made us sit to∣gether in heavenly places in Christ Jesus." For what end? "I hat in the ages to come, he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness towards us, through Christ Jesus." And in the 3d chapter, from the 2d verse▪ we have the end of the dispensation of grace, given to the a∣postle towards the Ephesians, "how that by revelation he made known unto me the mistery, which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit, that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gos∣pel; unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to make ALL MEN see what the fellowship of the mistery, which from the be∣ginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ."</P>
<P>Here we have glad tidings to ALL MEN; to ages to come; to all things in heaven and earth, in what divine grace did for, and among the apostles and Ephesians. The 5th of <HI>Romans,</HI> from the 14th to the end and 1st of <HI>Corin∣thians,</HI> v. 15. 19. shew the same thing, but have been al∣ready mentioned and need not be repeated.</P>
<P>Thus the second enquiry has been attended to, <ABBR><HI>Viz.</HI></ABBR> How doth marriage convey as in a mistery, the union of Christ and the church?</P>
<P>From what has been brought to view, we see the obliga∣tions those are under, that are brought to the faith of the gospel, to collect together in the profession of his name, and
<PB N="17" REF="018214_0016_0FA5C1B48EEB9098"/>
subjection to his authority, after the example of the first disciples in the first churches, to the same end, which will, I conceive, be the duty of the disciples till the second com∣ing of Jesus Christ, or till all things are put under his feet; till which time, he will use the same means to the same end. Much might be said here, "but except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it."</P>
<P>And not only their obligations to stand forth in the pro∣fession of his name, observing the order of the gospel, as practised by the first churches, but their obligations to an attention to all the precepts of the new testament, con∣cerning their conduct in every relation they sustain; par∣ticularly that of husband and wife, which the apostle has in view in the passage before us, beginning with the wives, verse 22. "Wives submit yourselves unto your own hus∣bands, as unto the Lord." <HI>Col.</HI> iii. 18. "as it is fit in the Lord." <HI>Titus</HI> ii. 4. "That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their husbands, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed." 1st of <HI>Peter.</HI> iii. to the end of the 6th verse, "Likewise ye wives in subjection to your own husbands; that if any obey not the word, they also may without the word, be won by the conversation of the wives, while they behold your chaste conversation, coupled with fear."</P>
<P>In these passages, the duty of the wives is made plain; inculcated and enforced from the obligations to Jesus Christ, "as unto the Lord, as it is fit in the Lord;" which shews the duty of the wise to flow from the authority of Jesus Christ, and to be directed by his will: So that in all her attention and submission to her husband, the autho∣rity and directions of Jesus Christ are ever to be kept in view, as the first motive the apostle uses, and truly it is no barren one, but full of excitation. The believing wife may thus think with herself, While I am attending my duty to my husband, the ever blessed Jesus, in his adorable con∣descension, is pleased to accept me as attending to him: Therefore, as to the Lord, will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in her mind, and excite to ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulness therein. The second m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tive, if it
<PB N="18" REF="018214_0017_0FA5C1B604BA20F8"/>
be a distinct one, is, "that the name of God and his doc∣trine be not blasphemed." <HI>Titus</HI> ii. 4. 5. "That they," the aged women, "may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children."—Wives are not only taught submission to their husbands from a sense of duty, but "to love their husbands, to love their children;" which will excite them, from inward af∣fection, ever to be studying and pursuing their comfort and happiness, while their own is increased by the comfort of love: And when to the motive, "as unto the Lord," is joined the "love of husbands and children, good, obe∣dient to their own husbands, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed," will follow; will fol∣low, did I say! is it not inseparably interwoven? O my Jesus! is thy name and doctrine concerned in my love and duty to my husband and children; how happy hast thou made me, in making love, which is my happiness, my duty; and bringing thy name and doctrine to my continual view; may it never be blasphemed by my evil conduct towards my husband and children; methought I moved in a low sphere in attending daily to them, but now I find I'm ex∣alted to wait on my Lord; he has been pleased to com∣mit his name and doctrine to my daily care: Angels hath not higher employment than is appointed me, in the very place where he hath placed me; and when I dwell in love, I dwell in him. The third motive, "that if any obey not the word, they also may, without the word, be won by the conversation of the wives, while they behold your chaste conversation with fear," must also be a powerful one, in the minds of believing wives, to an attention to the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corrupt∣able, of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price. If by the hidden man of the heart▪ we understand Christ dwelling in the hearts of believers by faith, we are led to that which is not corruptable, and to the pattern, fountain, and foundation of a meek and quiet spirit, which indeed, in the sight of God, is of great price. In <HI>Matthew</HI> xi. 29. Jesus Christ says, "Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly, and ye shall sind rest to your souls."
<PB N="19" REF="018214_0018_0FA5C1B6B8269A70"/>
The believing wives understand Jesus Christ to be the green olive tree from whence this fruit is found. So did their examples in the old time; "The holy women who trust∣ed in God, and thus adorned themselves, being in subjec∣tion to their own husbands, even as Sarah obeyed Abra∣ham, calling him Lord, whose daughters ye are as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement." What doth that import? So long as you are influenced by your duty to Jesus Christ, to attend your duty as wives, you appear to be the children, the followers, or imitators of the holy women who trusted in God; to belong to that family; and need not be afraid with any amazement; for if our hearts condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God. But if instead of attention to the directions of the apostles of Christ, there is giving heed to temptation, not contented in "modest apparel, with shamefacedness and so∣briety," but giving way to a prevailing solicitude for "the outward adorning of plating the hair," and of "wearing of gold, pearls and costly array," you will appear to be un∣der the influence of your lusts; to be walking according to the course of this world; according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the chil∣dren of disobedience; and the tendency of it will be to darkness and fear with amazement, more especially at times when there is most need of consolation. It certainly doth not become women professing godliness, to be thus adorn∣ed; but it becometh them to be adorned with good works. Certainly there appears ability for the good works of the gospel; such as feeding the hungry and cloathing the nak∣ed, at least as far as the price of the gold, pearls and costly array beyond modest apparel, that they wear; when the wearing it can be of no use, except evidencing their inat∣tention to the scripture, which prohibit their wearing it; or what is worse, opposition to them. In which case they may be advised to read <HI>James</HI> v. 1. 2. 3. with sober atten∣tion, which will shew such a conduct to tend to fear with amazement; which Christian women ought to turn from; to walk in love to Jesus Christ, to their husbands and chil∣dren, according to the directions of the apostles of Jesus
<PB N="20" REF="018214_0019_0FA5C1B737DD5888"/>
Christ, which tends to cast out the fear that has torment. Verse 24. "Therfore, as the church is subject to Christ, so let the wives to their own husbands, in every thing." Which shews the duty of wives to submit to and seek to please their husbands, in every thing that is not contrary to the mind of Jesus Christ, "as it is fit in the Lord." When the wife makes this the rule of her conduct, she pursues her own hap∣piness in connection with her husband's. When his will is contrary to the mind of Christ, or would wish his wife to do that she is afraid will incur his displeasure, she is then only to point out her reasons from the word, and to perse∣vere in attention to the will of Jesus Christ. But when she sets up her own will in opposition to her husband, and glo∣ries in a victory over him, however she may seem to gratify herself, she will find it leads to future shame, and fear with amazement.</P>
<P>We have also, in the passage before us, verse 25. "Hus∣bands love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it," &amp;c. Verse 28. 29. and 30. "So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies; he that loveth his wife loveth himself: For no man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church. For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones." From this passage, to∣gether with <HI>Collosians</HI> iii. 19. and 1st of <HI>Peter,</HI> iii. 7. we may collect the mind of Jesus Christ, as signified by the apostles, concerning the duty of husbands. 'Tis compre∣hended in love. "Husbands love your wives." Love is the fulfiling of the law, and the rule or measure of the love of the husband to the wife, is, "as Christ loved the church, and gave himself for it, that he might sanctify and cleanse it, with the washing of water by the word; that he might make<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the former translation.</NOTE> it to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish."</P>
<P>"Jesus Christ loved the church, and gave himself for it." "Husbands love your wives, even as Christ loved the church." Did Jesus Christ give himself; and am I or have
<PB N="21" REF="018214_0020_0FA5C1B7F4157B18"/>
I any thing that is for the comfort and happiness of my wife, that through covetousness or self-will I may with∣hold from her, and yet manifest I love her as Christ loved the church? Jesus Christ paid the church's debt, re∣deemed her from captivity, directed her in her duty, sup∣plied her wants, knows how to have compassion on the ig∣norant, and them that are out of the way: He took her circumstances of want, distress and misery, upon himself, and communicates of his fullness unto her; "is of God made to us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and re∣demption;" and is in all an example to direct the love of the husband to his wife; that he attend to all her wants, distresses and miseries; to relieve and supply them accord∣ing to his measure. And when any thing appears in the conduct of the wife inconsistent with her duty, as the hus∣band is the head of the wife, he is to point out her duty from the word. "Jesus Christ gave himself for the church, that he might sanctity and cleanse it, with the washing of water by the word." If the word be made use of in the exercise of love, the tendency and efficacy would be to heal, as it would always bring Christ's authority to the view of the wife, and keep his example in the view of the hus∣band, and guard against the evil cautioned in <HI>Collosians</HI> iii. 19. "husbands love your wives, and be not bitter against them." Remember that bitterness always springs from the root of bitterness; "the root that beareth gall and wormword, from the turning away from the root of the righteous, that beareth fruit." Yet so great is the deceit∣fulness of our own hearts, and so imperceptible the preva∣lence of the enemy, transformed into an angel of light, that this bitterness may appear to spring from a sort of re∣ligious ignorance, or a mistaken religious Zeal.</P>
<P>When we read, "that the husband is the head of the wife," and that it is his duty to rule well his own house, a strange notion of headship and rule may take place, that upon every slight occasion there is a bitter resolution; I will be master of my own house; I will be minded; it is my duty, &amp;c. That instead of viewing the head as the seat of wisdom, care and tenderness, it is viewed as the
<PB N="22" REF="018214_0021_0FA5C1B8D37E0550"/>
seat of domineering; as if its only care was to see, that my will may be done; and perhaps for no fault, only that a particular humour is not pleased, there will be a stamp on the floor, enough to make all ring again, and the hus∣band hold himself not guilty, from a religious zeal to be minded to rule his own house. If I find out the man, can he be offended if I should inquire, Dear sir, where find you this in the example of Jesus Christ?</P>
<P>From this cause often proceeds such discontent with that which the industrious wife has endeavoured to pre∣pare, with as much agreeableness to her husband, as the means he had put into her hands was capable of; that he will despise both it and her; and instead of coming with gratitude, thanksgiving and satisfaction to his meals, as that which shews his increasing and perpetual obligation to eat, drink, and do all to the glory of God, there will be bitter unneasiness through the whole of the time calcu∣lated for family enjoyment and happiness. If there be such a man, shall I put him in mind, that when Jesus fed the multitude with barley bread and fish, he gave thanks; and when Paul and those with him on board the ship, were about to eat, "he took bread and gave thanks to God, in presence of them all, and when he had broken, he began to eat; then were they all of good chear, and they also took meat." Dear sir, thanksgiving to God, and all of good chear, becomes a Christan's table, which the head of the family is to lead in:* Every thing contrary comes from the root of bitter∣terness, however disordered the head may be, so as not to see whence it is. The caution, "be not bitter against them," is to be attended to through the whole of the conduct of the husband to the wife, with whom he is to "dwell ac∣cording to knowledge." The above described conduct must flow from ignorance and blindness, from the God of this world blinding the mind, though it be with a religious zeal for his own honor as the head of the wife, while the honor that is to be given to the wife as the weaker vessel, as his own flesh, as now, "bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh, as heirs together of the grace of
<PB N="23" REF="018214_0022_0FA5C1B9C03C5938"/>
life," is not attended to, and their mutual prayers are here∣by hindered.</P>
<P>I have been the longer on this, because this evil may proceed from ignorance, and the temptation in it not disco∣vered, which, when brought to light, may be the sooner turned from; for certainly, if a man find a proneness to these or the like evils, in his temper, it will be natural to seek a hiding place, to excuse and justify himself, and no where can he find one more easy, than under a cloak of false religion. But when the true cause or source is discovered to himself, he must conclude, that it is more agreeable to his duty, when he finds a legal, fretful, froward disposition working in him, only waiting an opportunity of breaking forth, to get alone, and take shame to himself, before him to whom all things are naked and open, who is "the great High Priest that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the son of God, touched with the feeling of our infirmities, in all points tempted as we are, without sin," and take encouragement from him, "to ask mercy, and find grace to help, in time of need," and take his example with him into his family; who says, "learn of me, for I am meek an lowly." Whence proceeds a gospel disposition, which is meek and quiet.</P>
<P>Now then, if there be any in this honorable relation, "HEAD OF THE WIFE, EVEN AS CHRIST IS HEAD OF THE CHURCH," who with their mouths shew much love to "the grace of God that bringeth salvation to all men that hath appeared," who are so far from soberly at∣tending to its teaching "to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously and godly, looking for the blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour, Jesus Christ; who gave him∣self for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify us unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works," that they give themselves over to ungodliness and worldly lusts, in such a manner, as to neglect their business, their means of providing for the temporal salvation and comfort of their families for idle company, and gaim∣ing, till pinched with want, they are fretful and profane
<PB N="24" REF="018214_0023_0FA5C1BD8795D560"/>
in their families, to a degree, that would be a scandel to heathens, where by the name of God and his doctrines are blasphemed. I dare to appeal to their consciences, upon sober reflection (which they must come to, whether they will or no) whether their hearts don't die within them and become as a stone.</P>
<P>I was looking in my own mind, whether there were not a deception some how attending the temptations, by which these persons are carried away. Perhaps they will say, they thank God they are not as other men,—worldly, covetous, afraid of spending a little time or a little money; for their part they don't desire to have their hearts over-charged with cares of this life, &amp;c. But do they not see, that this very practice involves them and their families in the utmost perplexity? What, though they may sometimes appear to gain, hath not divine truth said, "wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished"? Yes, it shall. Divine power is en∣gaged in the cause of divine truth, and it shall be accomplish∣ed. Perhaps in this very instance in which you gain, it is fulfiled respecting some other family.</P>
<P>When Jesus Christ exhorted his disciples. "Take heed least your hearts be over charged with surfeiting and drunk∣enness, and cares of this life, and that day come upon you unawares," did he not give an example of diligence in work∣ing the work of him that sent him? Says he, "my meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work." Is it not the character of his spouse? "She worketh wil∣lingly with her hands, she looketh well to the ways of her houshold, and eateth not the bread of idleness." And doth not his apostles direct his disciples, 1st of <HI>Thessalonians,</HI> iv. 11. 12. "That ye study to be quiet and do your own business, and work with your own hands, that ye may walk honestly towards them that are without, and ye may have lack of nothing." 2d of <HI>Thessalonians,</HI> iii. 11. 12. "We hear that there are some that walk disorderly, work∣ing not at all, but are busy bodies; now them that are such, we command and exhort, by our LORD JESUS, that with quietness they work and eat their own bread." <HI>Ephesians</HI> iv. 28. "Rather let him labour, working with
<PB N="25" REF="018214_0024_0FA5C1BF4B84A778"/>
his hands the thing that is good, that he might have to give to him that needeth." In this the apostle was an ex∣ample, 1st of <HI>Thessaionians,</HI> ii. 9. "For labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God." <HI>Acts</HI> xx. 34. 35. "These hands have ministered to my necessities, and to them that were with me: So labouring, ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of our Lord Jesus, how he said it is more blessed to give than to receive."</P>
<P>Let these sayings sink down into our ears, and let us remember the exhortation, <HI>Romans</HI> xiii. 13. 14. "Let us walk honestly as in the day, not in rioting and drunken∣ness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envy, but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof." 'Tis all day with him; we are naked and open before him; "If I say the darkness shall cover me, even the night shall be light about me; yea, the darkness hideth not from thee, but the night shineth as the day; the darkness and the light are both alike to thee."</P>
<P>As the duty of husband is now in view, I would take a little more particular notice of the apostle <HI>Peter</HI>'s compre∣hensive address to them, all contained in one verse, 1st epistle, iii. 7. "Likewise ye husbands dwell with them ac∣cording to knowledge, giving honor unto the wife as to the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers be not hindered."</P>
<P>"Dwell with them according to knowledge." This may import the knowledge of the mistery contained in the marriage union; as it is a figure of the union of Christ and the church, the knowledge of the love, care, compas∣sion and tenderness, that Jesus Christ shews to his church, as an example to the husband, and of what his word and the nat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e of the marriage union binds upon them."</P>
<P>"Giving honor to the wise as to the weaker vessel." The apostle says, "If one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; and if one member be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, all the mem∣bers rejoice with it." 'Tis true here, if the head and hus∣band give honor to the wise, all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sible parts of the fa∣mily
<PB N="26" REF="018214_0025_0FA5C1BF70FA8360"/>
rejoice; if she frequently, and without cause, suffer his displeasure, all the family suffer herein. But how may I understand this expression, "honor as to the weaker ves∣sel"? When I look into the house, I see the weaker vessels, the glass, the china, honored with the most attention, the safest and most honorable place assigned to them; they are handled with the greatest care and tenderness; and in <HI>Isaiah</HI> xxii. from the 15th, I read, that when Shebna, who looked upon himself as the nail fastened in the sure place, should be removed, cut down and fall, and the burden on it broken, God would fasten Eliakim as a type of Jesus Christ, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a nail in a sure place; "And they shall hang on him all the glory of his Father's house, all vessels of small quantity, from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of flaggons." Here is honor to the weaker vessels. Hence the honor to the wife, denotes the care and tenderness with which she is to be treated; and in all her fears, distresses and perplexities, to be put in mind of the nail in the sure place, that can never be cut down and fall.</P>
<P>This is agreeable to what follows: "And as being heirs together of the grace of life." The grace of life, is the grace that reigns through righteousness to eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord; which comes not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy. The idea of heirship, is the idea of inheriting what was not our own, by the will of another. Heirs to∣gether of the grace of life, carries the mutual obligation that the grace of the gospel brings us under, to obedience to him in our mutual duties one to another.</P>
<P>"That your prayers be not hindered." The direction, 1st of <HI>Peter,</HI> iv. 7. "Be ye therefore sober, and watch un∣to prayer," together with the repeated exhortations of Je∣sus Christ, to watch and pray, shews the duty of watch∣fulness against every thing whereby our prayers may be hindered; and as Jesus Christ, in <HI>Mark</HI> xi. 52. says, "When ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any," we may easily see that the contrary spirit must hinder mu∣tual prayer; for where envy and stri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is, there is confusion and every evil work. That your prayers be not hinder∣ed,
<PB N="27" REF="018214_0026_0FA5C1C05108F258"/>
may have reference to mutual prayer in the church, which ought to be attended in the exercise of fervent charity, and which may be marred, weakened or broken, by an indulged carriage, unbecoming the gospel of Christ; in which case the direction of Jesus Christ, "If thou bring thy gift to the alter, and there remember that thy brother hath ought against thee, leave there thy gift before the al∣ter, and go thy way, first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift," ought to be attended to.—It may also have reference to their mutual prayers in the family, as their circumstances, opportunity and sense of divine mercy, may call them thereunto: For we have di∣rection to pray with all prayer and supplication in the spirit; and in every thing, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, to be making our requests known to God; and it must be the mutual duties of husbands and wives, to guard against that conduct which would hinder the mutual enjoyment of such a privilege.</P>
<P>In what has been brought to view, the scriptures, in their most obvious meaning, have been attended to, as knowing they come with the authority of Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all. The authority of the apostles is the authority of Christ, as he has connected them with him∣self; so that he that despises these their exhortations, de∣spiseth not man, but God. And sure I am, that an atten∣tion to them, is the surest way to domestic happiness. I have often thought, that if two persons come together in the relation of husband and wife, that wished to live hap∣pily in that relation, they could walk by no better rules, even supposing they did not believe the scriptures; but in that case they would have but the body or the letter, with∣out the spirit. The honor, the nearness, the endeared af∣fection, and the obligations mutually arising in that rela∣tion, cannot be fully seen but as they center in Christ Jesus, in his union with, love to, and care of, his church; in whom the man is not without the woman, nor the woman without the man: "For OF HIM, and TO HIM, and THROUGH HIM, are all things:" To whom be glory forever. AMEN.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX,</HEAD>
<HEAD>Containing thoughts occasioned by the pro∣visions of the table.</HEAD>
<P>Upon looking over the time calculated for family enjoy∣ment, happiness, &amp;c. mentioned in the 22d page; some thoughts occured on the provision of the table, which swell'd beyond the compass of a marginal note, and are brought in by way of appendix, as follows.</P>
<P>WHEN the head of a family retiring from his business to his meals, has the happiness to make them all set down around him and the example of Jesus Christ and the apostle, to direct, excite, embolden, and encourage him to give thanks before them all, if his mind is led to understand the glory of the gospel, what can hin∣der his breaking forth into praise, for all spiritual blessings in heavenly things, in Christ Jesus, as they are brought to his view in the bounties of providence on his table; yea, though it be at a time of poverty, and there be only bread and water, to preserve life till some further provisions can be procured, yet even that would point us to the bread and water of life, for even they were made by him, and for him, and do silently, eminently and constantly hold forth his glory; if with them I have a piece of a broiled fish, shall I be discontent because I have no more, and seem as if the meal was not large enough to call me to thanksgiv∣ing; or shall I not rather remember it is the same with which Jesus fed the multitudes after he had given thanks; the same that was laid on the coals, <HI>John</HI> xxi. 9. to which he called his disciples to "come and dine," verse 12; or would my discontented mind find fault with my bread, because I can't obtain every day the finest of the wheat, let it rather remind me, that it was barley bread with which
<PB N="31" REF="018214_0030_0FA5C1C39CCE30F8"/>
Jesus fed the multitude, <HI>John</HI> vi 9. If the adversary, whose name is legion, for they are many, attempt like the Midi∣anites that typified them, <HI>Judges</HI> vi. to destroy the increase of the earth, by introducing murmuring, dis∣content and uneasiness, instead of thanksgiving at my table, may this barley bread with which the multitudes were fed, remind me of what the barley cake did, in the host of the Midianites, and be as officacious to take away my murmuring; for will it not pierce my heart with grief and shame that I should murmur at that for which my Lord gives thanks! Can I have the least appearance of a servant or disciple, to be thus above my master and Lord, while a "perfect disciple shall be as his master." <HI>Luke</HI> vi. 40. "Herein is the love perfect in us, that we should have boldness in the day of judgment, for as he is, so are we in this world." 1st of <HI>John,</HI> iv. 17. Methinks here is also a further lesson for me; when a lad had only five barley loaves, and two small fishes, they were all at the service of Jesus Christ, of whom and for whom he had them. If I am favoured with meat, it is calculated to lead me to the meat that endureth to eternal life, which the Son of man shall give, who says, "my flesh is meat indeed." If I have a dinner of herbs, and the sense of di∣vine love exciting me and my family to love one another, 'tis better than a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ox, and hatred to my God and family therewith: Shocking the thought! that my un∣grateful heart is capable of this! If I cast my eye on the salt, while I reach after it, it would silently remind me of the favour of the knowledge of Christ, made manifest by his apostles in every p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace, "which is the salt of the covenant of God that never should be lacking," typified by that which was to accompany all the offerings of the children of Israel, and which was given them in Ezra's time, by Darius, chap. vi. 9. and by Artaxerxes, chap. vii. 22. at the commandment of the priest, without prescribing, pointing forward to the favour of the knowledge of Christ, which my salt would remind me of: This turns my mind to an instruc∣tion we have in <HI>Ezra</HI> iv. 14. "Now because we are salted with the salt of the palace, it was not meet for us to see
<PB N="32" REF="018214_0031_0FA5C1C81EA1C818"/>
the kings dishonour:" This is the instruction my salt, which was created by him, is of him and for him, would communi∣cate to me. Is my table furnished, and am I favoured with roots, and will they not turn my mind to the "root of Jesse," <HI>Isaiah</HI> xi. 10. "the root out of a ory ground," chap. liii. 2. "the root of the righteous that yieldeth or giveth," <HI>Proverbs</HI> xii. 12. For my roots were by him, they are from him and for him, to hold forth his glory. Do I find my table enrich'd with fruits, the fruit of the vine; have I a cup of wine there, surely it so fully points to Jesus Christ, that as oft as I drink it, I ought to remember him, whether it be at the Lord's supper, or at my own table. Do I see the beans▪ pease and squashes on my table, either of these are the fruit of the bush, and would lead my mind to the angel of the Lord, or the agent Jehovah, that appeared to Moses in the bush, which burned with fire and was not consumed, which caused Moses to turn aside, to behold with attention, when he was told to put off his shoes from off his feet, in token of reverence and resignation to his Lord, which be did, and was then instructed in the meaning, which led Moses to understand, that though the posterity of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, were in bondage in Egypt, sighing and groaning, and was expeled a stranger in Midi∣an, a strange land, yet God saw their trouble and heard their cry, and said unto him, "I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, of Isaac and of Jacob, this is my name forever, and my memorial unto all ages;" I that de∣livered Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in all their distresses, particularly that saved Jacob, and his family when in danger o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> being burnt up with famine, by bringing them into Egypt, and giving them there the blessing of Joseph, with which he blessed his land in the seven plentious years, even the sweetness of heaven, the dew, and the deep, and the sweet increase of the sun and the moon, the precious things of the mountains and hills, and the precious things of the earth, and the abundance thereof; whereby the good will of him that dwelt in the bush rested on Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren, as a type of him in whom all fullness dwells.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="018214_0032_0FA5C1C98FAB7D68"/>
"I AM that I AM, I am the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob; this is my name forever, and my memorial throughout all generations: I know the sorrows of their posterity, therefore I am come down to deliver them."—And is there not in this name and memorial joy to the whole earth? Is he the God of the Jews only, and not of the Gen∣tiles also? Yes, "even of the Gentiles also; the God of the whole earth shall he be called." The promise to Abra∣ham is. "In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed." So that there is not held forth to Moses in the burning bush, the distressed state of the children of Israel and their deliverance only, but of the whole human race, who by the curse of the fiery law, appeared in danger of being burnt up without remedy; but Jesus "was made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law;" he sustained the fire, and freed us from being consumed. His sustaining of, and deliverance from it, was the beginning of revenges on the enemy; on which the call is, "Rejoice O ye nations, his people." In view of which, in the lxviith <HI>Psalm,</HI> "All people" are called to "clap their hands, and shout with the voice of triumph; for the Lord, High and Terrible, a Great King over all the earth, he hath subdued the people under us, and the nations under our feet." The nation and people of the Jews, apprehend∣ed themselves above the Gentiles, and despised them; but since "God is gone up with a shout, the Lord with the sound of the trumpet," it is evident he hath chosen our inheritance for us, "the excellency of Jacob, whom he loved."</P>
<P>Our inheritance: All people, the Gentiles, who are fellow heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promises in Christ by the gospel, and all people, are called on, "Sing praises to God; sing praises; sing praises unto our King, sing praises; for God is King of all the earth; sing ye praises that have understanding: God reigneth over the heathen; God siteth upon his holy throne."—Agreeable to <HI>Psalm</HI> ii. where it is said, "Yet have I set my King upon my holy hill of Zion: Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee," (referring to the resurrection) "ask of me, and I will give the heathen thine inheritance, and the utmost parts of the earth thy possession." Upon
<PB N="34" REF="018214_0033_0FA5C1CB58D1CE38"/>
his resurrection, 'tis manifest they are his purchased pos∣session. This King now manifestly appears to reign in righteousness: "I have set my King upon my holy hill of Zion." So in the above xlviith <HI>Psalm,</HI> on his ascension, he is "King of all the earth," he "rigneth over the heathen," he "sitteth on his holy throne," he is come whose right it is; thus "the princes of the people are gathered together, the people of the God of Abraham;" he not only shielded Abraham's family in their affliction, but "the shields of the earth belong unto the Lord; he is greatly exalted."</P>
<P>Is there not a lesson for me, under my distressing trials, of what sort soever, to realize the reverence and sub∣jection that is due to my Lord, as in the case of Moses, <HI>Exodus</HI> iii. 5. and <HI>Joshua</HI> v. 15. resigning myself up to him as not my own, but redeemed by him? Now this was the manner in Israel, concerning redeeming and changing,—to establish all things, a man pluck'd off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour, and this was a sure witness in Israel that he had resigned his right, and it was the pro∣perty of him that redeemed it; which I am of my Lord Redeemer, and ought to realize it with reverend submis∣sion, under every affliction, knowing that in his everlasting name, his memorial through all generations, there is a fountain of all-sufficient consolation.</P>
<P>Are not these things brought to my view in the fruit of the bush upon my table? And doth not the rising and growing of these bushes from year to year, bring to my mind the use my Lord teaches me to make of this mani∣festation of himself, in proof of the resurrection, in <HI>Luke</HI> xx. 37. 38? Or, are the above-mentioned beans, pease and squashes, with the cucumbers and mellons, on my table, the fruit of the vine, then they all, with the blood of the grapes, point to the true vine from whence they proceed, to whom they belong, and for whom they were created. But have I not yet done? Am I presented with the fruit of the apple-tree, to bring to my mind the tree of life, which bear twelve fruits, and yielded her fruit every month; which fruit was for meat, and the leaf for medicine; "the leaves of the tree for the healing of the nations?" If my apple should remind me of the fruit of the forbidden tree,
<PB N="35" REF="018214_0034_0FA5C1CB85F75800"/>
by which sin and death entered, it will also lead me to Christ, by and for whom the apple-tree was created; for "as the apple-tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons." I have all in this tree; for the fruit is for food and the leaf for medicine. What may I understand by the leaves of the tree, in a natural sense? It shows that which evidences of what sort the tree is: Thus the fig tree was known it had leaves; and as the leaves of a fig-tree were sewed together for aprons, after the fall, to hide nakedness and shame, as has been the manner ever since, "to cover with a covering, but not of God's spirit," to go about to establish our own righteousness, which covering is too narrow, a man cannot wrap him∣self in it; so when Jesus came the Lord our righteous∣ness, he saith to the fig-tree, the emblem of seeking life by our own righteousness, "never man eat fruit of thee henceforth forever, and immediately the fig-tree withered away;" but his leaf shall not wither,—his profession.—The truth he heard of God at this baptism, "this is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased," the truth he taught through his life and ministry, that he witnessed a good confession to, before Pontious Pilot, that was wit∣nessed in his resurrection, whereby he is "declared the Son of God, with power according to the spirit of holiness," this truth, which Peter made confession of, on which he will build his church, is, I apprehend, what we are led to for the meaning of the "leaves of the tree, that are for the healing of the nations," whose virtues shall prevail 'till "there be no more curse."</P>
<P>But it is time to rise from table. Please, sir, to stop and taste a few nuts. Yes, my friend, I will taste them, that they may lead me down to the garden of nuts, of which I read, <HI>Song</HI> vi. 11. to see the "fruits of the valley;" for val∣lies, mountains, rocks, hills and plains, beasts, and all cat∣tle, fruitful trees, and all cedars, creeping things, and fowls of every wing, all in their places shew forth his glory; for all things were created by him and for him: To whom be glory forever. AMEN.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>PARENT and child comprehends more endearing, engaging, and respectful ideas, than I can conceive, much less express the fullness of: But when I think of them, they appear as harmonious notes in agreeable musick, which may delight the ear of him who cannot give them their proper sound. Notwithstanding, I shall attempt something that may be useful in conducting in that endeared relation.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="018214_0036_0FA5C1CCF80C2CD0"/>
'Tis the place and duty of a child to be in his parents presence with reverence and delight; and 'tis the duty of the parent to guard against a childless familiarity, that would tend to make the child humoursome, and bring the parent into contempt; and against such an austerity as would make their presence a dread which the child would seek to avoid. 'Tis their duty also to guard against ill names, and such phrases and expressions as would intimate to the minds of the children, that their parents have not the fear of God before their eyes. If instead of the pater∣nal, endearing expressions of—my dear child, my son, my daughter,—'tis—you little our, you dog, you plague,—or the like; 'tis, what shall I call it! a violent rape on the morals of the child. Such children are early capable of reasoning after this manner,—if I am such a creature, what is my father that begat me, or my mother that brought me forth?—and they soon get emboldened to use the same expressions, at least to those that offend them; which is productive of wrath and strife, and promotes an undesirable hardness and harshness of temper and manners.</P>
<P>Parents must likewise guard against a customary threat∣ning, which alienates the mind, and sowers the temper of the children, and produces contempt of the parents, when they see their threatnings are only verbal, never to be feared except when they get into a passion. Threatnings ought to be given out with great caution and care; to be what will be the parents indispensible duty in the threatned case: They ought to be confined to moral evils; such as ap∣parent wilsul disobedience, lying, cheating, or profaneness; any thing that is an apparent sin against God or our neigh∣bour: And when judiciously given out, they ought to be punctually executed, not in passion and anger, but in love and faithfulness. And when any accidental miscarriage takes place, such as the breaking an earthen vessel, or a square of glass, it should meet with a gentle admonition, never carried so high as to tempt the children to lie to hide it, for fear of the wrath of their parents.</P>
<P>Here I would take notice of the apostolick direction, <HI>Ephesians</HI> vi. 4. "And ye fathers provoke not your chil∣dren
<PB N="38" REF="018214_0037_0FA5C1CE07CF7F18"/>
to wrath, least they be discouraged, but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord."</P>
<P>"Least they be discouraged." Doth it not include in it every thing in the education of children, that would give them a dreadful discouraging idea of God, or of their natural parents, so as to cause them secretly to wish they could hide themselves from him or them, or to make them unhappy at the thought of being always in the Divine presence (a source of security and happiness where his name is known) or at the thought of coming into the presence of their parents.</P>
<P>The scripture account that God is love, and the way in which it is made manifest, is calculated to shew our high∣est happiness in his presence and favour; and what is to be most feared, is that which will displease him, and procure his frown. In like manner, if parents conduct by the Divine rule, their children will be happiest in their pre∣sence and favour, and it must be a great punishment to be turned away from them, as a token of displeasure, but for an hour. But when, on the contrary, they cannot come where they are, without some hard names or dreadful threatnings, they are provoked and discouraged.</P>
<P>"But bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord." Nurture conveys the idea of nursing or nourishment, agreeable to 1st of <HI>Thessalonians,</HI> ii. 7. "We were gentle among you, as a nurse cherisheth her chil∣dren;" 1st of <HI>Peter,</HI> ii. 2. "As new-born babes desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby;" 1st of <HI>Timothy,</HI> iv. 6. "Nourished up in the words of faith and good doctrine." Admonition conveys the idea, to coun∣sel, advise, instruct, warn and reprove.</P>
<P>The admonition of the Lord, leads my mind to 1st of <HI>Corinthians,</HI> x. 11. where the apostle, speaking of the things written in the old testament, says, "they are written for our admonition." The scriptures of the new began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by them that heard him▪ They are the admonition of the Lord; not only the sayings of Christ himself, but of his apostles, that he connects with himself, "He that heareth you, heareth
<PB N="39" REF="018214_0038_0FA5C1CE77E67878"/>
me;" are the admonition of the Lord, as is expressed 1st of <HI>Thessalonians,</HI> ii. 11. "As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father his children, that ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you to his kingdom and glory."</P>
<P>1st. For nurture. Let the children have the sincere milk of the word, that they may grow thereby; let them suck and be satisfied with these breasts of consolation. Only let us look into the various passages, in which Jesus Christ spake of, to, or about little children: See <HI>Matthew</HI> xviii. 1. to 14. chap. xix. 14. 15. <HI>Matthew</HI> xxi. 16. <HI>Mark</HI> xi. 13. to 16. <HI>Luke</HI> xviii. 14. 16. and see if there is any thing besides glad tidings of great joy to them: If it be so, let the dear children know it as soon as they are capable of understanding; let them be "nourished up in the words of faith," in those truths that are to be believed, "and good doctrine;" the good news, the glad tidings that the GOSPEL contains. Or is there any threatnings of eter∣nal damnation to children, by the apostles of Christ? If not, who dare ring them in their ears!</P>
<P>There is indeed, temporal destruction, with the greatest infamy, threatned disobedient children, <HI>Proverbs</HI> xxx. 17. which is a part of the second branch: The admonition of the Lord so is, <HI>Luke</HI> xv. 15. where the prodigal, from a father's house, where is bread enough, and to spare, is brought to be a poor hungry swine-feeder.</P>
<P>So is every caution and warning through the scriptures, especially the new testament, which the parents ought to be acquainted with, and bring to the children's view, for warning, reproving, counseling, advising and instructing on all occasions, particularly upon any thing that is sinful: The divine admonition ought to be brought immediately from the lively oracles, and they convinced it is disagree∣able to the will of their Greater, Preserver and Redeemer, on whom their all depends.</P>
<P>For an example of admonition, we have one drawn to our hands by the apostle, 1st of <HI>Corinthians</HI> 1. to 11. which being well considered, may help parents to make use of other scriptures in a similar way, as there may be occasion.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="018214_0039_0FA5C1CF41D57798"/>
Thus have I given some thoughts on the education of children, to whom I wish the blessedness of an early ac∣quaintance with what God has done for them, and their obligations of gratitude to him. 'Tis the duty of parents, from childhood, to acquaint them with the holy scriptures, where∣in these things are contained (as Timothy was) "which are able to make wise unto salvation, through faith in Christ Jesus:" 'Tis with him to communicate the know∣ledge of himself, according to his good pleasure: To whom be glory and dominion, forever.

<Q>—<HI>I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in the truth.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN I meditate on the case of children, and propose an exhortation to them, instead of being governed by the various opinions there are about them. I would turn to the scriptures, and form my apprehensions from them, that I may know what ground there is for a word of exhortation to them. In <HI>Matthew</HI> xviii. 5. and <HI>Mark</HI> ix. 37. Jesus Christ says, "Whosoever shall receive one such little child in my name, receiveth me." One such;—it was a child he took in his arms, in <HI>Mark;</HI> a lit∣tle child in <HI>Matthew:</HI> And in <HI>Luke</HI> xviii. 15. they brought infants, and Jesus said, "Suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom
<PB N="42" REF="018214_0041_0FA5C1D223C95C98"/>
of Heaven." How comes infants constituted of the king∣dom of Heaven? <HI>Matthew</HI> xviii. 11. shews Jesus Christ came to save them; therefore, "take heed that ye de∣spise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my fa∣ther which is in heaven; for the son of man is come to save that which is lost." Their angels: What is the office of the holy angels? "Are they not all ministring spirits, sent forth to minister for them that shall be heirs of salvation?" If their angels always behold the face of the God and Fa∣ther of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is in heaven, doth it not convey the idea that nothing can be done against them, in a way of despising them, but what must be immediately known there? And if angels minister to infants, are they not heirs of salvation? How came they heirs; are they not by nature children of wrath; are they not lost in Adam, their head; how came they heirs of salvation? Verse 11. informs us, "For the son of man came to save that which was lost." Though they are really lost in union with the first Adam, and however they may appear lost in their own utter helplessness, and the various distresses and miseries, even death itself, that they are exposed to; yet if the son of man is come to save that which is lost; has taken hold of them, taken their nature into union with himself, and constituted them of the kingdom of God, in virtue of his own righteousness, who says, <HI>Luke</HI> xviii. 15. "for of such is the kingdom of God," then "take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones." Are they not despised by those that freely and frequently speak of the everlasting damnation of infants? Do they get it from any word of Jesus Christ concerning them? Why is it so? That they are lost is readily acknowledged; but the son of man came to save that which was lost: Will he not accomplish his design; is he not mighty to save? He is the shepherd that looks after that which is lost," that "takes the lambs into his arms and carries them in his bosom:" "How think ye, if a man have an hundred sheep, if one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety-nine, and goeth into the mountains and seeketh that which is gone astay▪
<PB N="43" REF="018214_0042_0FA5C1D24E8F2470"/>
and if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, that he rejoiceth more of that than of the ninety-nine that went not astray: EVEN so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish." If Jesus Christ came to save them, and it is not the will of your Father in heaven that one of them should perish, must not the despisers of them, that so freely treat of their dam∣nation, suspect themselves as advocates for the destroyer? Do they not prevail to draw a vail over the power and compassion of the Saviour, and destroy the peace of thou∣sands?</P>
<P>It may not be amiss to illustrate this, by bringing in the testimony of the prophets and apostles. When God, by his prophet <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> was comforting ancient Israel in what he would do for them, chap. xxxi. 1. to 14. the ground and reason of which we have in the 11th verse, "For the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand of stronger than he." Having redeemed and ransomed him, "He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him as a shepherd his flock: Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion; and they shall not sorrow any more at all; then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old men together; for I will turn their mourning into joy, and make them re∣joice from their sorrow, and I will satiate the soul of the priest with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the Lord." That this good news may reach the bottom of their affliction and sorrow, expressed in verse 15. in a prophetic view, of the destruction of the children of Bethlehem, by Herod, 'tis said, verse 16. "Re∣frain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears, for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the Lord; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy, and there is hope in thine end, saith the Lord, that thy children shall come again to their own border." Death was the enemy where they went; from which they shall come again, and inherit their own border, in him, or by virtue of union with him, "who through death, destroys him that had the power of death; that is the devil." "Thus saith the Lord,
<PB N="44" REF="018214_0043_0FA5C1D2F12D10C8"/>
even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered; for I will con∣tend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children, <HI>Isaiah</HI> xlix 25." "They shall come again from the land of the enemy."</P>
<P>"And there is hope in thine end that thy children shall come again to their own border." What is their own bor∣der? 'Tis the fruit of the purchase of Jesus Christ, called their own in virtue of their union to him. To this I would add the apostle Peter, in <HI>Acts</HI> ii. 39. "For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all that are afar, of even as many as the Lord our God shall call." The promise to you and your children, as extensive as the call of the gospel, which is directed to every creature, and expressed in this language by the prophet, "Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth."</P>
<P>It may not be unsuitable to take notice here of the error of many parents, and others, who comfort themselves con∣cerning their infant children, when they die, from their in∣nocency, saying they are undoubtedly gone to happiness, and rob the Saviour of his glory, and themselves of any true comfort. If they would think a few minutes, if the salva∣tion by Jesus Christ is excluded, and they gone to happi∣ness by virtue of their own innocency, 'tis a happiness that they themselves can never be admitted to; "for there is no other name under Heaven among men, whereby they can be saved, but the name of Jesus" They seem not to attend to the apostle; "he hath concluded all under sin, that he might have mercy upon all."</P>
<P>The apostle John, when writing to the disciples, under the character of little children, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ys, "I write unto you, little children, because your sin are forgiven, for his name sake: I write unto you, little children, because you have known the Father." The Father is not known to any but to whomsoever the son will reveal him. When they understood the forgivness of sins for his name's sake, the know the father: Thus is he, who is love, made mani∣fest. And this is what little children in Christ's school are taught, by an aged apostle, "I write unto you, little chil∣dren,
<PB N="45" REF="018214_0044_0FA5C1D75F6AA210"/>
because your sins are forgiven you, for his name's sake," which he lays in the foundation of his exhorta∣tions to them, "Love not the world," &amp;c.</P>
<P>I am aware of an objection against what I have brought to view. How can these things be so, when we see chil∣dren, as soon as they grow up, turn after their own lusts, after "the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience?" Do we not see children and youth soon arrive at a shocking pitch of profaneness and immora∣ity? Yes, verily, multitudes of them appear to be in the snare of the devil, and led captive by him, at his will: But whose are they? Do they belong to him who hath insnared them, and leads them captive; yea, though he so blind their minds as to lead them to profane the name of their right∣ful owner, and to say he shall not reign over us, doth it alienate the property of them? May they not be told with truth and propriety, that they are not their own, they be∣long to Jesus Christ, to whom they must give an account of their conduct, who will bring every knee of them to bow to him; that they are working out their own shame and confusion of face before him? May they not be called to repent; to return to their rightful proprietor, owner and Lord?</P>
<P>But how repent, unless they are wrong in their aliena∣tion to Jesus Christ, and in their walking according to the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience? How return, if they have not gone astray; if they belong not to their Lord Redeemer; i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he be not the shepherd and bishop of their souls? Is not this idea held up in every call to repentance? <HI>Isaiah</HI> xiiv. 22. "Return, for I have re∣deemed thee." <HI>Jeremiah</HI> iii. 12. "Return, thou back-slid∣ing Israel, saith the Lord;" 14. "Turn, O back sliding children, saith the Lord. for I am married unto you;" 22. "Return, ye back sliding children, I will heal your back-slidings." The idea of his right as Redeemer, Husband and Father, is implied in the call to return, and every ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to re∣pentance supposes mercy: "I here is forgivness with thee, that thou mayest he feared," and we cannot conceive of
<PB N="46" REF="018214_0045_0FA5C1D78A2A0D00"/>
mercy but in a consistency with justice: If justice is satisfi∣ed, mercy slows without obstruction, "Return, for I have redeemed thee."</P>
<P>Besides, if they are in the snare of the devil, led captive by him at his will, "for this purpose was the son of man manifest, that he might destroy the works of the devil."—When the prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> introduces the inquiry, chap. xlix. 24. "Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hebrew, in the bible margin, "The captivity of the just."</NOTE> the lawful captive delivered?"<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">By "the lawful captive," or "the captivity of the just," I understand, that those who were taken captive by the mighty adversary, were taken from where they lawfully belonged, led captive from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e just one, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> The answer is, verse 25. "But thus saith the Lord, the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered, for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children." He will not leave them in his hands; no, not one of the hundred; the shepherd will not lose one of the hundred sheep; he came to save that which is lost; he came to do his Father's will, and it is not his will "that one of these little ones should perish."</P>
<P>Thus much OF CHILDREN; what follows is address∣ed TO CHILDREN.</P>
<P>Children,—let me ask your attention to what is laid be∣fore you, simply from the scriptures.—Are these things so? If so, methinks it is "glad tidings of great joy," and shews the ground of obligation that lies upon you to look upon yourselves as not your own, as not at liberty to walk after your own lusts, as not belonging to satan, however he may seek to devour or insnare you,—you be∣long to Jesus Christ, our Creator, Preserver and Redeem∣er, he has bought you with his blood, and therefore you are under the highest obligations to "glorify him in your spirits and bodies which are his;" and is it not in this view, most ungrateful, base and wicked, to walk contrary thereunto? I have thought whether it were not the ig∣norance of children about what our Lord and Saviour is to them, has done, and is doing for them, that was the
<PB N="47" REF="018214_0046_0FA5C1D96B5FB6C8"/>
cause of their sinking so low into the mire and filth of pro∣faneness and immorality; while a sense of love always carries with it, a sense of obligation to grateful obedience: Where this is the case, it would be natural to turn our minds to the exhortation of the apostle to children, "chil∣dren obey your parents in the Lord, for this right." When we consider the wretched, helpless circumstances we come into the world in, and view the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, giving paternal love, tenderness and compassion to our parents, and by this means, daily loading us with his benefits; as soon as we are capable of reflecting, it must give us a view of ob∣ligation to gratitude and thankfulness, which cannot be expressed, without a sense of obligation to obedience; therefore, children "obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right," it must commend itself to your own con∣sciences as right.—I wish to unfold something of the mean∣ing of this expression; if I could, it would discover such obligations as could not be broken through, without do∣ing violence to our own consciences, our peace and com∣fort, for it must lead to a united view of what our Lord Jesus Christ has done, and is doing for us, and what he makes our parents to us, and does for us by their means, which would lead our minds to all the thought, care, toil and labour of the father, and to the compassionate tender∣ness of the mother, who often, with much pain and plea∣sure, nourishes her offspring from her own body, both night and day; well might the apostle say, "children obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right." Here also is a direction to children, when they come to years capable of understanding the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning them; if ever the parents, through the preva∣lency of temptation, command any thing contrary to his revealed will, to remember the words of the apostle to the rulers who commanded them contrary to the will of the Lord, "we ought to obey God rather than man," and duti∣fully to remind their parents of the reasons of their con∣duct; to obey in any thing contrary to his revealed will, would not be to obey them "in the LORD."</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="018214_0047_0FA5C1D9C0B6F008"/>
"Honor thy father and mother," which is the first commandment, with promise, "that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest live long on the earth;" a con∣trary conduct, slights the divine authority that commands, and the divine promise annexed thereto; it slights our own welfare, and forfeits life upon earth. What base fol∣ly, guilt and shame, doth disobedience to parents carry along with it!</P>
<P>When the apostle to the Romans, speaks of God's giv∣ing over the Gentiles to a reprobace mind, and rehearses what they were filled with which led thereunto, we find in the catalogue. "disobedience to parents," <HI>Romans</HI> i. 30. So when he speaks of the perilous times that should come in the last days, one part of the description is, "disobedi∣ence to parents," 2d. of <HI>Timothy</HI> iii. 2.</P>
<P>This is that which, besides the ingratitude, baseness and wickedness that appears in it, has a leading tendency, to various others, if not all kinds of vice and wickedness: Therefore, "children obey your parents in the Lord;" "Honor thy father and mother, that it may be well with thee, that thou mayest live long upon the earth," even till it please God in his providence, to call you by a natural death, in his own time and way, and not hurry yourselves, by your disobedience, into the hands of civil justice, to an untimely death, to which it has a tendency.</P>
<P>When Jesus Christ addressed his disciples under the cha∣racter of little children, <HI>John</HI> xiii. 33. the exhortation he had to give them, to which he thus called their attention, was, verse 34, "a new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another." This is the duty of every one, more especially of all who hope for salvation from the love of the Saviour, which ought to excite children to treat one another with kindness and love, not to wish evil to any that offend us, not to "render evil for evil," not to de∣spise those that are poor, but endeavour to think of the forgivness and condescension of Jesus Christ, agreeable to the exhortation of the apostle, <HI>Ephesians</HI> iv. 31. "let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil
<PB N="49" REF="018214_0048_0FA5C1DAC7857210"/>
speaking, be put away from you, with all malice, and be ye kind one to another, tender hearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ hath forgiven you."</P>
<P>Here I would take notice of what I have seen in some instances, with sorrow. When young persons have been intrusted with the care of little children, either at home, or to lead them abroad, they have seemed to lose all sense of that kindness and tender-heartedness, of which the apostle speaks; and as it were, cruelly divert themselves with tell∣ing the dear little ones frightful stories, and giving out many threatnings to them, 'till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear and distress has banish∣ed every agreeable feeling from their tender breasts, and they burst forth into sobbing and crying; for which they have been called cross,—twitch'd, scolded at, threatned and beaten: Which conduct, in many cases, has been of very hurtful consequences. How contrary is this to the obligations we are under to walk in love one to another!</P>
<P>There is one consideration I would suggest to all that have the care of little children; i. e. what Jesus Christ said, "of such is the kingdom of heaven," and in that remark∣able passage, <HI>Mark</HI> ix. 36. 37. "he took a child and set him in the midst of them, and when he had taken him in his arms," (observe the bigness of the child, a child in the arms) "he said unto them, whosoever shall receive one of such children, in my name, receiveth me, and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth him that sent me." Would we treat Jesus Christ in the above manner were he upon earth! And will not the above passages warrant us to say that he is now on earth, in the least of these his brethren; so that as ye did unto them ye did unto him; and on re∣flection on the above conduct, any of us that have been guilty, on recollecting what we have done when we thought no one saw us, may well be afraid, and say—surely God was in the place, and I knew it not.</P>
<P>May the thought ever excite to an attention to the fore∣mentioned exhortation, "Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamour and evil speaking, be put away." Evil speaking comes from a little member, but "'tis a fire, a world of iniquity▪ it sets on fire the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of nature, and
<PB N="50" REF="018214_0049_0FA5C1DC3B769090"/>
is set on fire of hell," saith the apostle <HI>James,</HI> iii. 6. It would perhaps be impossible to describe the variety into which this fire blazes and unfolds itself. Without attempt∣ing this, I shall just take notice of it as it discovers itself in profaneness, uncleanness, covetousness, stealing and lying.</P>
<P>To begin with profaneness. Can there be any thing more base, ungrateful and wicked, than to profane that worthy name, which is above every name, in which there is salvation, the just God and the Saviour, Emanuel, God with us. We know not God but as he is thus manifest: So there can be no species of profaning that name, but it includes in it the base ingratitude of profaning the Saviour. If the consideration of his being their God, was used as an argument against profaneness with ancient Israel, as <HI>Levi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us</HI> xix. 12. "neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God," certainly the grace manifested in the gospel hath the same obligations in it; and opens up a ground of perpe∣tual praise and thanksgiving: And who of us are not at some times constrained to acknowledge it; and with our tongues to bless God, even the Father? Shall we there∣with curse our follow-creatures, "that are made after the similitude of God?" <HI>James</HI> iii. 9. Certainly these things ought not so to be; the grace of the gospel teaches, by precept and example, "to bless them that curse you, bless and curse not, love your enemies; do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that despitefully use and per∣secute you." Here we are warranted to make use of the Saviour's name, in praying for our enemies; he bids us, and sets the example. How contrary the profane practice of calling on his name to damn those we think injure or displease us! It comes as evidently from the destroyer, our adversary, the devil, as the above-mentioned precepts and examples come from the Saviour. Stop dear child! stop young man, over-heated with passion and resentment, and hurried by temptation! stop one minute and consider which you ought to follow: Hear the apostle, "Let all evil speaking▪be put away from you, with all malice."</P>
<P>The next branch of evil speaking I would take notice of, is uncleanness. If we consider the warnings and cautions
<PB N="51" REF="018214_0050_0FA5C1DCB69F1010"/>
given against it by the apostles of Christ,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Gallations</HI> v. 19 <HI>Ephasians</HI> v. 3 to 6. <HI>Collosians</HI> iii. 5. to 8 1st of <HI>Thessalonians,</HI> iv. 3. to 8. 1st of <HI>Peter.</HI> iv. 2. 3. And in the epistle to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> the apostle says, "What, know ye not that your bodies are members of Christ; shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? GOD forbid. What I know ye not that he that is joined to an harlot is one body, for two shall be one flesh; but he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit. Flee fornication: Every sin that a man doth is without the body; but he that commiteth fornication, sineth against his own body. What! know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a price? Therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's." 1st of <HI>Corinthians,</HI> vi. 15. to the end.</NOTE> we must see the propriety of our children's being warned to shun the appear∣ance of this evil; to shun the speeches, behaviour and com∣pany, that tends hereunto. What shameful ingratitude doth it discover, when we see our children, who are pri∣viledged in their education so as to be able to write their thoughts legibly, defiling the fences, as they pass the streets, with shameful uncleanness! writing what they would at first be afraid to speak, 'till their minds are hardened by writing, then reading and repeating, 'till they contract a habit of evil speaking; which has a tendency, as they grow up, to lead after all uncleanness with greediness. I think I may tell them with truth, if they should live two or three times twenty years after, it would not obliterate, but in∣crease the shame that such conduct must produce, upon the remembrance of such follies; for old age has a lively re∣membrance of what is done in youth, though it forgets later transactions; and the sense of forgivness doth not take away the ground of shame, but increases it, agreeable to <HI>Ezekiel</HI> xvi. 63. "That thou mayst remember and be ashamed and confounded, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified towards thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord God."—This I would close with the advice of Divine wisdom. <HI>Pro∣verbs</HI> vii. 24. to 27. "Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth; let not thine heart decline to her ways; go not astray in her paths; for she hath cast down many wounded, yea, many strong have been slain by her: Her house the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death."</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="018214_0051_0FA5C1DDAA613288"/>
I might mention the scripture warnings and cautions against covetousness, stealing and lying. Covetousness in children discovers itself in a fretful uneasiness for what be∣longs to other children, prompting them to attain it by any means, if it can't be had, as they say, by fair means, and tempts them to steal, and then to lye to hide the crime. The story of Achan is left on record for warning and ad∣monition, which we have in <HI>Joshua</HI> vii. particularly verses 20 and 21, where Achan says, "Indeed I have sinned against the LORD GOD of Israel, when I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold, of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them and took them, and behold them hid in the earth, in the midst of my tent." &amp;c.</P>
<P>Covetousness is idolatry, it makes an idol of what it fixes on: Can there be any thing more base and disinge∣nious, when we consider what God is to us, and hath done for us, than to prefer any thing our pevish minds covet after, and in pursuit of it to disobey him. The apostle speaking to the Ephesians, who were in some mea∣sure acquainted with what God in Christ was to them, and had done for them, says, chap. iv 28. "Let him that stole, steal no more, but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing that is good, as shewing a more ex∣cellent way of attaining what we need, and helping those that may need help from us. And in the same chapter, he exhorts to put away lying, and speak truth "every man to his neighbour," from this motive, "for we are members one of another;" therefore, in this view, we act as if we would deceive ourselves, as if the eye should pur∣posely betray the feet into the mire.</P>
<P>By what has been brought to view of the ingratitude and baseness of some of the many works of the flesh, something is discoverable of the source from whence they proceed, and of the darkness, distress and misery to which they tend: It may lead to the same reflections on all the works of the flesh, which are brought to view by Jesus Christ, <HI>Matthew</HI> xv▪ 19. 20. <HI>Mark</HI> vii. 21. 22. and by the apostle, <HI>Gallations</HI> v 19. 20. 21. It might be very season∣able
<PB N="53" REF="018214_0052_0FA5C1DE3B7EAEB0"/>
and profitable by way of contrast, to consider the source and leading tendency of the fruits of the spirit, against which there is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o law, the very mention of which, as they are enumerated by the apostle, <HI>Gallations</HI> v. 22. 23. wears the aspect of delight and satisfaction, both as they flow from the love of Jesus, and lead to an imitation of him, and satisfaction in him: But as I mean not to burden young minds with what is over lengthy, I only hint at these things, to open a field for themselves to walk in with pleasure, delight and thanksgiving,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thanksgiving is a grateful, delightful expression of our obligations to God, for the manifestation of himself, "in Christ Jesus who is love;" and for all the mercies that flow to us from that fountain, both temporal, spiritual and eternal, which is to be expressed in thinking, speaking, sing∣ing and living his praise, to which children are encouraged, by the graci∣ous acceptance the children met with from Jesus Christ, in their hosanna's to the son of David, <HI>Matthew</HI> xxi. 15. 16.</NOTE> as they come to be capable; knowing that the path of the just one, which he trod and laid out for his followers to walk in, who has given us an example, "that we should follow his steps," is as "the shining light that shineth more and more unto the perfect day," while the way of the wicked one, into which he seeks to insnare his followers, is as darkness. <HI>Proverbs</HI> iv. 18. 19.</P>
<P>Thus, dear children, I have endeavoured to lead your minds to the grace revealed in the gospel, and to the view of the obligations this grace lays upon us;—if you accept my attempt, and are hereby excited to turn over the pages of revelation and to attend to Jesus Christ and his apostles, speaking in them, I have all I wish for from you: I know I am not my own, and that every opportunity and talent I have, belongs to my Redeemer; therefore, so far as duty to him. and love to you hath excited me hereto, I have reason to be satisfied, whatever reception it hath. To his honor and glory, and your comfort and benefit it is de∣voted. To the only wise God our Saviour, glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. AMEN.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>Note.</HI> In page 10th I mentioned, that both "he and she are called the Lord our righte∣ousness," referring to <HI>Jeremiah</HI> xxiii. 6. and xxxiii. 16. where we read, "In those days shall Judah be saved and Jerusalem shall dwell safely; and this is the name wherewith she shall be called, The Lord our righteousness." In the former translation it is, "And he that shall call her, is the Lord our righteousness;" referring to the glorious person by whom she should be called into that safe and happy state. If our translators meant to be thus understood, it did not appear clear in their manner of expression,—which led me to understand it as spoken of the name of the church. I have therefore recited the passage as it stands in both translations.</NOTE>
