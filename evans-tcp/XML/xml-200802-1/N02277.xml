</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE words are a moving Exhortation from GOD to a provoking People, whose multiplied and hai∣nous Transgressions had ripened them for the Ven∣geance of Heaven, and for Disolating Judgments. If we look back to the preceeding Chapter, we shall find a heavy Charge drawn up against a Professing People of GOD, as an Evidence of their woful Apostacy
<PB N="2" REF="002709_0005_0FE5F2F4D55E7D50"/>
and Declension: Yea their Case is represented as if there was scarce a Godly Man to be found among them all. Ver.I. <HI>Run ye to and fro through the Streets of Jerusalem, and see now and know, and seek in the Broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be any that executeth Judgment, that seeketh the Truth, and I will pardon it.</HI> A <HI>sad Case</HI> truly, if there were not one such to be found. <HI>Jeru∣salem</HI> would then be worse than <HI>Sodom</HI> that was destroyed by Fire from Heaven, for even there a Righteous <HI>Lot</HI> was found. But doubt∣less the Words are to be taken not absolutely, but in a comparative sense, to denote the few∣ness of the Godly there, and the general Cor∣ruption reigning among all Ranks and Orders of Men. More particularly, they are Articled against for their <HI>false swearing, their Incorri∣gibleness under the Judgments of God, their Idolatry and Adultery, their contempt of God's Word and Prophets, together with their criminal regardlessness of him whose Power is great, and for which he is to be feared, their Deceit, In∣justice &amp; Violence, and delight in false Prophets.</HI> The <HI>Prophets prophesy falsely, and the Priests bear rule by their means, and my people love to have it so.</HI> And in the midst of these Charges we have once and again such sharp Interroga∣tories, as one would think should have awaken∣ed and wounded them. <HI>How shall I Pardon thee for this? Shall I not visit for these things? saith the Lord: and shall not my soul be aven∣ged on such a nation as this? Hear ye not me?
<PB N="3" REF="002709_0006_0FE60FFB28BCD540"/>
saith the Lord: Will ye not tremble at my pre∣sence? And again, Shall I not visit for these things? saith the Lord: Shall not my soul be a∣venged on such a Nation as this?</HI> In this Chap∣ter therefore we find a justly offended GOD giving a Commission to the <HI>Chaldeans</HI> the E∣nemies of His People, to go up against and de∣stroy them for their very great Wickedness: which Commission, with the ground and reason of it, we have opened, Ver. 6, 7. <HI>Thus hath the Lord of Hosts said, Hew ye down Trees, and cast amount against Jerusalem: this is the City to be visited, she is wholly oppression in the midst of her. As a Fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her wickedness: Violence and spoil is heard in her, before me continually is grief and wounds.</HI> Thus is <HI>Jerusalem</HI> con∣victed and threatned. Nevertheless, such are the Compassions of a Merciful GOD, that before he brings the threatned Ruin upon a sinful People, he will give them warning and advise them of their Danger; that they may Repent of their wickedness, and thereby pre∣vent the evil coming upon them, which he threatens to do unto them.</P>
<P><HI>BE thou Instructed, O Jerusalem</HI>; or as it is in the Original, <HI>Be thou Corrected, O Jerusa∣lem: i.e.</HI> <Q>By the Correction thou hast felt already, and which is further threatned, Be perswaded to Repentance before it be too late.</Q> Let the Rod and Reproof teach thee Wisdom. Nor were they at any loss what to do in this
<PB N="4" REF="002709_0007_0FE5F2F5B20AEDA8"/>
Case, being well enough acquainted with what GOD tells them by this Prophet, Chap. 18.7, 8. <HI>At what Instant I shall speak concerning a Na∣tion and concerning a Kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down and to destroy it: If that Na∣tion against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>LEST my Soul depart from thee</HI>; or ac∣cording to the Marginal Reading of our Bibles, be <HI>loosed</HI> or <HI>disjointed</HI> from thee: which doubtless, as our English Annotatours observe, <Q>is a Metaphor taken from the Dislocation of a Limb, the loosing it from it's natural Place and Posture, and putting it, as we say, <HI>out of Joynt</HI>: intimating what a Pain and Grief it is to GOD to leave or cast off a People, whom he hath taken into Covenant with himself, and with how much difficulty he is drawn thereunto.</Q></P>
<P><HI>LEST I make thee Desolate, a Land not Inhabited.</HI> Lest I both cast thee off, and cut thee off. So that the Exhortation is grounded upon the most Important and weighty Consi∣derations Imaginable.</P>
<P>THERE are Four Doctrines I shall offer you and briefly speak to from the Words.</P>
<P><HI>DOCT.</HI> I. THAT the <HI>Happiness</HI> of a Peo∣ple consists in having the <HI>Gracious Pre∣sence</HI> of GOD with them.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002709_0008_0FE610239635FD48"/><HI>DOCT.</HI> II. THAT GOD is not so engaged to any People, but that upon Just Provo∣cation given him, his <HI>Soul</HI> may <HI>Depart</HI> from them.</P>
<P><HI>DOCT.</HI> III. THAT the <HI>Departure of GOD</HI> from a People, opens a Door for <HI>Desola∣ting Judgments</HI> to enter in upon them.</P>
<P><HI>DOCT.</HI> IV. THAT it is both the <HI>Duty &amp; Interest</HI> of a People, to do all that in them lies, to prevent so great a Calamity, as the Departure of GOD's Soul <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them will certainly carry in it.</P>
<P>DOCT. <HI>I.</HI> THAT <HI>the happiness of a People consists in having the gracious</HI> Presence <HI>of GOD with them.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Doctrine, tho' not express'd, is yet ne∣cessarily implied in the Words. For if the Departure of GOD from a People be threatned as the sorest Judgment that can befal them, and they be earnestly called upon to use their ut∣most endeavours to prevent it, then nothing can be more plain than that his gracious Pre∣sence with them is their Happiness and Glory.</P>
<P>AND this is a Truth very easily proved and evidenced. It is not the Confluence of all the Blessings of Providence, the abounding of Peace. Plenty, and every other common Mercy desi∣rable, that does so denominate a People Happy, as the having <HI>GOD with them</HI>; whose Pre∣sence is <HI>All in All</HI> to their <HI>Felicity</HI>: Their
<PB N="6" REF="002709_0009_0FE60FDE2C95E8F0"/>
<HI>Decus ac Tutamen</HI>; their Ornament and Safety, their Defence and Glory. This is the compre∣hensive Sum of all GOD's gracious Promises to his People, as he told <HI>Joshua,</HI> Chap. 1.5. <HI>I will be with thee: I will not sail thee, nor forsake thee.</HI> Yea we find the Phrase sometimes used as expressive of all the Good that need to be re∣quested for. Thus by Pious <HI>Jacob,</HI> Gen. 28.20. <HI>If God will be with we, and will keep me in the way that I go.</HI> What Benediction can be more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> than that, <HI>The Great G0D be with</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Every Blessing is included in such a Wish. Thus <HI>Boaz</HI> came from <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> and said unto his Reapers, <HI>The Lord be with you</HI>: And they to be even with him in Blessing, an∣swered, <HI>The Lord bless thee,</HI> Ruth 2.4. With this also we find good old <HI>Israel</HI> comforting his Sons a little before his Death; Gen. 48.21. And Israel said, Behold I die: but <HI>G0D shall be with you.</HI> So that the best thing which GOD can Promise, or we can desire, either for our selves or others, is, <HI>That GOD will be with us and them.</HI> Agreable whereto is that Prayer of <HI>Solomon,</HI> at the Dedication of the Temple, I. Kings 8.57 <HI>The Lord our God be with us, as he was with our Fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us.</HI> If the Divine Presence be once obtained, all other Blessings both Temporal and Spiritual will be consequent thereupon.</P>
<P>Particularly,</P>
<P><HI>IF GOD be with a People,</HI> he will favour them with all that <HI>Guidance, Conduct and Di∣rection</HI> that they need. It is one Character given;
<PB N="7" REF="002709_0010_0FE60FFB33EBA428"/>
of the Blessed GOD, <HI>Psal.</HI> 84.11. For the Lord God is a <HI>Sun.</HI> And when he is thus stiled in reference to his People, it denotes that he will afford them all that <HI>Light &amp; Direction,</HI> which their <HI>Darkness</HI> &amp; <HI>Difficulties</HI> may render need∣ful for them: That he will instruct and teach them in the way which they should go, and guide them with his eye; that when their way is hedg'd up with thorns, and their Perplexities such that they know not what to do, he will acquaint them with their Duty, and make their way plain before them.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>GOD's Presence</HI> with a People sup∣poses that he will both <HI>Support under, and ex∣tricate them out of their Difficulties</HI>: That his Wisdom, Power and Goodness shall be singu∣larly concern'd and employ'd for them; that he will be to them a present help in every time of trouble to support them under their Burdens; yea that in the mount of their Diffi∣culties he will be seen, working Deliverance and Salvation for them. And O that in these respects there were more visible tokens of GOD's <HI>Gracious Presence</HI> with this People!</P>
<P>Again, <HI>GOD's being</HI> with a People implies his <HI>Prospering and giving Success to all their lawful Undertakings.</HI> We read concerning <HI>Jo∣seph,</HI> Gen. 39.23. <HI>The Lord was with him: and that which he did, the lord made it to prosper.</HI> And of <HI>Uzziah,</HI> 2 Chron. 26.5. <HI>That as long as he sought the Lord, God made him to prosper.</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="002709_0011_0FE60FE0C3437AD0"/>
The Success of all endeavours is from the Lord alone, and if a People once engage the Pre∣sence of GOD with them, they may be assured of all kind of Prosperity. Salvation then will in every respect be nigh unto them, and Glory dwell in the Land.</P>
<P>I might further have said, That where <HI>GOD is present with a People,</HI> he will mul∣tiply <HI>Spiritual Blessings</HI> also upon them. He will be <HI>graciously present</HI> with his <HI>own Ordi∣nances,</HI> and give abundant Success to the Means of Grace. He will <HI>pour his Spirit upon the Seed</HI> of his People, <HI>and his blessing upon their Offspring</HI>: Yea such shall be the remarkable smiles of Heaven upon them, that all shall take Notice, That they are <HI>a People whom the Lord hath Blessed.</HI> This and much more than this is implied in the <HI>Presence of GOD</HI> with a People; and if so, we may well draw up the Psalmists's Conclusion, Psal. 144, ult. <HI>Happy is the People that is in such a case: yea, Happy is that People whose God is the Lord.</HI> And may I not say, that GOD is thus with a People, and will continue to be so as long as they con∣tinue Faithful to him? 2 Chron. 15.2. <HI>Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin. The Lord is with you, while ye he him.</HI> Hag 2.4. <HI>Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabe, saith the Lord, and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech the High Priest, &amp; be strong, all ye people of the land saith the Lord and work: for I am with you, saith the Lord of Hosts.</HI> And the People of GOD may while they keep close to their Duty, glory
<PB N="9" REF="002709_0012_0FE6100200B2BDD0"/>
in this, and triumph over all the Difficulties and Dangers that may await them, as the Church does, Psal. 46. ult. <HI>The Lord of Hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our Refuge. Selub.</HI></P>
<P>DOCT, II <HI>THAT GOD is not so </HI>enga∣ged<HI> to any People, but that upon just Pro∣vocation given him, his Soul may</HI> depart <HI>from them.</HI></P>
<P>THE People of the <HI>Jews</HI> were once the on∣ly Professing People that GOD had in the World; a People whom he chose to himself above all People that were upon the Face of the Earth, and upon whom he bestowed special Marks of his Favour. Nevertheless these he warns, to take Care lest by their unsuitable Carriage they should provoke him to abandon and cast them off; left his <HI>Soul</HI> should depart from them: Which Phrase imports not only his suspending the former manifestations of his Love; but even his utter loathing and abhor∣rence of them.</P>
<P>For clearing this, I shall</P>
<P N="1">I. SHOW <HI>when</HI> a People may be said to <HI>provoke</HI> GOD to depart from them.</P>
<P N="2">II. THAT upon such Provocation given, <HI>his Soul may depart</HI> from them.</P>
<P N="1">I. I am to show <HI>when a People may be said to provoke G0D to depart from them.</HI></P>
<P>AND altho' it be true that all Sins are dis∣pleasing to GOD, and what his Soul hates you
<PB N="10" REF="002709_0013_0FE60FE0D045B5E0"/>
there are some particular Evils which are more provoking, and have a more direct tendency to cause him to depart. I'll Instance here only in a few of them; and hint at some others af∣terward.</P>
<P N="1">1. A <HI>Low Esteem of the Presence of GOD with a People,</HI> will be a just Provocation to him to depart from them. If that which is the highest Favour of GOD to a People be under∣valued and meanly accounted of by them, how Just must it be with him to take the same from them, that they may learn to know the worth of it by the want thereof? What Person would burden others with his Company, that neither value nor desire it? Now this is too often the Case of a Professing People with respect to the gracious Presence of GOD with them. They don't set that Value upon it, which the Excel∣lency of the Blessing calls for: they are not so Thankful for it when enjoyed, as they ought to be: they are not so desirous of the Continuance of it, as indeed they should be: nor are they so concerned at the awful Tokens of it's withdraw from them, as it might be rea∣sonably expected they would be: not yet so Prayerful to him as the solemn Dispensation calls upon them to be like him, Psal. 90.13, 15. <HI>Return, O Lord, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy Servants. Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil.</HI> When a People are so regardless of the Presence of GOD, and look upon it as a matter
<PB N="11" REF="002709_0014_0FE61023A12C2830"/>
of Indifferency whether they are favour'd with it or not, no wonder if a Jealous GOD be pro∣voked to withdraw the same from them. Here is Just Provocation given him to depart.</P>
<P N="2">2. A <HI>Departure from the Pure Instituted Worship of GOD</HI> will provoke him to Depart. The Glorious GOD who is the sole Object of Religious Worship, has given sufficient Directi∣on in his Word, how he will be Worshipped by his Creatures. And to Worship him after a way of our own devising, will be found very provoking to him, who is a GOD Jealous for himself and his own Glory. Now as to a Pro∣fessing People, it is but reasonably supposed that they have been instructed in the Purity of Divine Worship; that unto them has been shown the Form of GOD's House, and the Fashion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, with all the Or∣dinances and Laws thereof. (<HI>Ezek.</HI> 43.11.) That they have often been urged to hold fast the form of sound words, and contend earnestly for the Faith delivered to the Saints: to re∣member how they have received and heard, and hold fast: and beware lest being led away with the Error of the Wicked, they should fall from their own stedfastness. To leave then the Com∣mandments of GOD for the Traditions of Men, and introduce those Ceremonies into his Worship, and add those Inventions of our own thereto which he never Commanded, will be found a plain encroachment upon the Divine
<PB N="12" REF="002709_0015_0FE60FE8386E1B20"/>
Prerogative. And such as are guilty in this re∣spect would do well to consider what Answer they shall give in to GOD another Day, when he shall demand of them, as in Isa. 1.12. <HI>Who hath required this at your hands?</HI> Matth. 15.8, 9. <HI>This People draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honoureth me with their lips: but their heart is far from me. But in Vain they do worship me, teaching for Doctrines the</HI> Commandments <HI>of Men.</HI> This will be look'd upon as a Departure from GOD.</P>
<P N="3">3. AN <HI>unsuitable Carriage towards G0D's Messengers &amp; Servants,</HI> will have a dreadful tendency to provoke him to Depart from a People. Where his Gospel is priz d, and his Servants meet with a kind Entertainment, with such a People GOD will continue his gracious Presence. With them he has given his Servants Orders to abide; and a Temporal Blessing has been wont to go along with the Gospel. But if a People grow cold in their Affections to Divine Truths, and misuse the Messengers of the Lord, he who has sent them, will look upon it as a Contempt cast upon him∣self, which he will not bear. There were ma∣ny crying abominations in <HI>Jerusalem</HI>; but yet her Destruction seems to bear Date from the prevailing of this Sin. 2 Chron. 36.15, 16. <HI>And the Lord God of their Fathers sent to them by his Messengers, rising up betimes, and send∣ing them, because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place. But they mocked
<PB N="13" REF="002709_0016_0FE61025B59B1560"/>
the Messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his Prophets, until the wrath of the Lord arise against his People, till there was no Remedy.</HI> Be thou <HI>Instructed,</HI> O NEW-ENG∣LAND, and let <HI>Jerusalem</HI>'s Ruine be a Warn∣ing to thee.</P>
<P>Felix quem faciunt aliena pericula cantum.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>INCORRIGIBLENESS under the Judgments of G0D</HI> has also a direct tendency to provoke him to depart. This we find to be an Article in the heavy Indictment brought in against that People, whom God in the Text calls upon to be Instructed, left his Soul depart from them. Jer 53. <HI>O Lord, thou hast stricken them, but they have not grieved: thou hast consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a Rock, they have refused to return. lsa, 42.25. He hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of Battel; and it hath set him on fire round about, yet he know not, and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.</HI> The Design of GOD in the Calamities he brings upon his People is to humble, reform and do them good: whereas if these prove ineffectual to reclaim them, if in the very face of Judg∣iments, they will continue to provoke him, what can be expected, but that being grieved for the hardness of their heart, he should withdraw from them? The abuse of his Goodness, with the Contempt of his Rod, is certainly a suffici∣ent
<PB N="14" REF="002709_0017_0FE61009E1D33DA0"/>
Provocation to him to take his leave of such a People, and to resolve against them; as in Ezek. 24 13. <HI>Because I have purged thee,</HI> (i e. used Means for thy Purgation and Reformation,) <HI>and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be pur∣ged from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. THE general Unprofitableness of a People under Gospel Ordinances, <HI>will be a sad Prog∣nostick of GOD's Departure from them,</HI> Bar∣renness <HI>under the Means of Grace is very pro∣voking to GOD, and what he will by no Means dispense with. However it may be born with in the</HI> Wilderness, <HI>yet in the</HI> Vineyard <HI>it is In∣tolerable. Luke 13.6, 7.</HI> A certain man had a Fig-tree planted in his vineyard, and he came and sought fruit there on, and found none. Then sail he unto tbe Dresser of his Vineyard, Behold these three years I come seeking fruit on this Fig-tree, and find none: cut it down, why cum∣breth it the ground? <HI>Agreable where to are those awful words of our Saviour, Matth. 21.43.</HI> Therefore I say unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. <HI>And how much greater the Danger is, when instead of</HI> Good Fruits, <HI>there is an abounding of</HI> Evil Fruits, <HI>may be seen from, Isa. 5.1, —7.</HI> My wel beloved hath a vineyard in a very fruit∣ful bill. And he senced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted with the choisst vine, and built a Tower in the midst of it, and
<PB N="15" REF="002709_0018_0FE61025C4661558"/>
also made a wine press therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes. And now 0 Inhabitants of Je∣rusalem, and wen of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard, what could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes? And now go to: I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard; I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down. And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged, but there shall come up briars and thorns: I will also command the Clouds that they rain no rain upon it. For the vineyard of the Lord of Hosts is the House of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for Judgment, but behold Oppression; for righteosness, but behold a Cry.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>DECAYS in Religion,</HI> as to the life and power of it, have a sad tendency to provoke GOD to Depart from a People. When Men abate in their Love to GOD and his Service, decline in Grace and as to a close Walk with GOD; become Formal in Duty, luke-warm and remiss in Religion, this is most hateful and abominable to GOD, and what we often find him warning his People against. Hear how he bespeaks the Church of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> Rev. 2.4, 5. <HI>I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love. Remember therefore from
<PB N="16" REF="002709_0019_0FE61009ED333E48"/>
whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works: or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place.</HI> Thus the Church of <HI>Sardis,</HI> Rev. 3.2, 3. <HI>Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect,</HI> or filled up, <HI>before God. Remem∣ber how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast and repent.</HI> And again, Ver. 16. to the Church of <HI>Laodic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a; Because thou art luke-warm and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth,</HI> Other things might here have been mention'd, but the time will not allow it.</P>
<P>I pass therefore,</P>
<P N="2">II. TO show that <HI>upon such Provocation given, GODs Soul may depart from a People.</HI> He is not so bound to them that he must needs continue his gracious Presence with them. He may depart from them. The thing is possible, as may easily be made to appear.</P>
<P N="1">I. IT is painly supposed in the <HI>Threatnings</HI> of GOD thus to deal with his People in case they depart from him. He has given them sufficiently to understand what they may expect and look for, in Case they provoke his Holy Anger and Displeasure against them. The Text supposs that GOD <HI>may</HI> depart from a People, or else the Admonition had been of no force at all. Yea there are many express threatnings of this Nature in the Word of GOD.

So GOD told <HI>Moses,</HI> Deut. 31.16, 17. <HI>Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy Fathers, and this People will rise up and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land, and will forsake me, and break my Covenant which I have made with them. Then my Anger shall be kind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed against them in that Day, and I will forsake them, and hide my face from them, and they shall be de∣voured, and many evils and troubles shall befal them, so that they will say in that day, Are not these Evils come upon us, because our God is not amongst us?</HI> Josh. 24.20. <HI>If ye forsake the Lord, and serve strange gods, then he will turn, and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.</HI> Jer. 23.39, 40. <HI>Be∣hold I, even I will utterly forget you, and l will forsake you, and the City that I gave you and your Fathers, and cast you out of my presence. And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame which shall not be forgotten.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. GOD has <HI>actually</HI> departed from a People upon their forsaking him. The Threatning has been verified in a most awful and terrible manner upon those that have stood in as near a Relation to GOD as ever any People did. Yea thus in particular he has done by the Na∣tion of the <HI>Jews.</HI> He has cast them off, and given them a Bill of Divorcement. 2 Chron. 24.20 <HI>Because ye have forsaken the Lord, he hath also forsaken you.</HI> Psal. 78.58, &amp;c. <HI>For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to Jealously with their gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="002709_0021_0FE610138FB61458"/>
<HI>Images, when God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel, So that he forsook the Tabernacle of Shiloh, the Tent which he placed among men: and delivered his Strength,</HI> (as the Ark was called) <HI>into Captivity, and his glory into the Enemies hand.</HI> And now they are set forth as an <HI>Example,</HI> to deter and warn others against the like Evils, Jer. 7.12, &amp;c. <HI>But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it, for the wickedness of my People Is∣rael. And now because ye have done all these works; saith the Lord, and I spake unto you ri∣sing up early and speaking but ye heard not. Therefore will I do unto this house, which is cal∣led by my name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you, and to your Fathers, as I have done to Shiloh. And I will cast you out of my sight, and my fury shall burn and not be quenched.</HI> And indeed it is but a <HI>Righteous</HI> thing with GOD to abandon and depart from a People that have first forsaken him, 2 Chron. 12.5, 6. <HI>Thus saith the Lord, ye have forsaken me; and therefore have I also felt you. Whereupon the Princes of Israel, and the King humbled them∣selves, and they said, The Lord is Righteous.</HI></P>

<P>DOCT. III. THAT the Departure of GOD from a People, opens a Door for <HI>Desola∣ting Judgments</HI> to enter in.</P>
<P><HI>LEST my Soul depart from thee, lest I make the Desolate, a Land not Inhabited.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ter.
<PB N="19" REF="002709_0022_0FE5F2F32354C8D8"/>
Desolation will be the sure Effect of the Lord's Departure from a Land.</P>
<P>WHEN GOD departs from a People he throws down the Wall of his gracious <HI>Protection</HI> over them. While he is with them, he is as a wall of Fire round about them, and the Glory in the midst of them. His watchful eye is con∣tinually over them for Good, and his Almighty Power always engaged for their Safety, to keep off Troubles from them. Isa. 27.2, 3. <HI>In that day,</HI> (<HI>i.e.</HI> the Day when GOD is present with his People, in that Day,) <HI>Sing ye unto her, A vineyard of red wine, I the Lord do keep it. I will water it every moment: lest any hurt it, I will keep it night &amp; day.</HI> He is on their side when Men rise up against them; and all that would devour them shall be found <HI>Offenders; Evil shall come upon them,</HI> saith the Lord, (<HI>Jer.</HI> 2.3.) But WO unto them, when he <HI>departs</HI> from them. Then may they set up their <HI>Icha∣bod</HI> and inscribe upon it, <HI>The Glory is departed from Israel.</HI> The Hedge is broken down, and a Gap opened for an Inundation of wasting Calamities to enter in. No wonder if then they mourn out their sad Complaint, Psal. 80.12, 13. <HI>Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way, do pluck her? The Boar out of the Wood doth waste it, and the wild Beast of the Field doth devour it.</HI></P>
<P>Again, WHEN GOD's Soul departs from a People, he withdraws from them that <HI>Guidance,</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="002709_0023_0FE610139A8EF340"/>
and Direction he was wont to favour them with: he hides his Counsels from them, and leaves them in the Dark. Deut. 28.29. <HI>And thou shalt grope at noon-day, as the Blind gropeth in dark∣ness, and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways.</HI> Their Case is the same with <HI>Sauls,</HI> who once complained, I Sam. 28.15. <HI>I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by Prophets, nor by Urim, nor by Dreams.</HI> Thus the Church laments this Effect of GOD's Departure, Psal 74.9. <HI>We see not our signs, there is no more any Prophet, neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.</HI></P>
<P>AND what should now hinder, but that Sword and Fire, Famine and Pestilence, Inun∣dations, Earthquakes, and all sorts of Desola∣ting Calamities should rage among them? That all the Temporal Curses threatned in the Book of GOD against Disobedience, should be in∣flicted upon them? When GOD departed from <HI>Israel,</HI> we read of nothing but perpetual Deso∣lations, the Enemies roaring in the Congrega∣tions, and Burning up all the Synagogues of GOD in the Land, while He himself seem'd unmindful of their Grief, and regardless of their Prayers</P>
<P>Again, WHEN GOD departs from a Peo∣ple, <HI>Spiritual</HI> Plagues and Judgments will slow in upon them. If he remove not his Gospel, yet the Continuance of it will be in Judgment
<PB N="21" REF="002709_0024_0FE61032CD10C9A0"/>
to them. He will suspend the Influences of his Spirit and Blessing from it, so that it shall prove a favour of Death unto Death to them. He will verify those awful Words upon them, Isa. 6 9, 10. <HI>Hear ye indeed, but understand not, and see ye indeed, but perceive not, make the Heart of this People fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes, lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert and be healed.</HI> Rev. 22.11. <HI>He that is unjust, let him be unjust still; and be which is futhy, let him be filthy still.</HI> The work of Conversion is now at a dreadful stand, and the Gospel it self proves ineffectual to the doing any Good upon the Souls of Men. They are sealed up under Ju∣dicial Blindness and Hardness; penally given over by GOD to their own Hearts Lusts, to walk in their own Counsels. No Means used to reclaim them shall be of the least Service to them. The Curse is gone out against them. Let Fruit grow here no more forever; and so they languish, pine away and die in their Iniquities. A way is now made for GOD's Anger, and the Flood-gates opened for the Billows of his Wrath to over-whelm and de∣stroy them.</P>
<P>THIS, in short, is the deplorable Case of that People, from whom GOD's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oul departs, and over whom we must take up the Lamentation; and say <HI>Oh! that thou hadst but known,</HI> even thou, at least in this thy Day, <HI>the things that
<PB N="22" REF="002709_0025_0FE61015EA32B430"/>
belong unto thy peace; but now they are hid,</HI> Alas! <HI>for ever hid from thine eyes.</HI> All Good goes when GOD departs, and all Evil follows upon his Removal.</P>
<P>DOCT. <HI>IV.</HI> IT is both the <HI>Duty</HI> and <HI>In∣terest</HI> of a People to do all that in them lies to <HI>prevent</HI> so great a Calamity, as the Departure of GOD's Soul from them will will certainly carry in it.</P>
<P><HI>BE Instructed, O Jerusalem</HI>: Be advised, be counsell'd and warn'd; for the thing is not a matter of Indifferency, but of the highest Importance. It is not a vain thing, because the whole of your Happiness is concern'd in it.</P>
<P>FOR clearing this Doctrine, I shall</P>
<P N="1">1. CONSIDER <HI>what is implied</HI> in being thus Instructed; or what a People are to do, if they would prevent the sore Calamity of GOD's Departure from them</P>
<P N="2">2. GIVE you the <HI>Grounds</HI> of the Point, as they are laid down in the Doctrine.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> I am to show what is <HI>implied</HI> in being Instructed; or what a People are to do, if they would prevent the sore Calamity of GOD's Departure from them.</P>
<P>AND to hint only,</P>
<P N="1">I. IT implies that they be <HI>sensible of,</HI> and <HI>humbled for</HI> the least <HI>tokens</HI> of his <HI>Withdraw∣ment</HI> from them. GOD's Departure from a sinful People is not sudden and at once. He is
<PB N="23" REF="002709_0026_0FE61032D78F4BB8"/>
Infinite in his Patience, and endureth with much long-suffering, being loath to leave and give them over to Ruin. And when he is as it were compelled to do so, he proceeds very leisurely in such an Act of Judgment. He gives a People timely notice of it, that so they may stir up themselves to take hold of a Departing GOD.</P>
<P>THUS he dealt with <HI>Judah.</HI> Ezek. 9.3. <HI>The Glory of GOD</HI> goes first from the <HI>Cherub,</HI> to the <HI>Thre∣shold of the House</HI>; and stays there, as if it had a mind to be invited back again: then it goes from the <HI>Threshold of the House,</HI> and stands over the <HI>Cherubims,</HI> as if upon a penitent Call, it would drop down again to it's antient Station and Seat, over which it hovered, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 10.18. And when he was not sollicited to return, he <HI>departs out of the City,</HI> and <HI>stands upon the Moun∣tain,</HI> which is on the <HI>East part</HI> of the City, (Ezek. 11.23.) looking still towards, and hover∣ing about the <HI>Temple,</HI> as if loath, to depart and abandon the Place and People. As the Learned Mr. <HI>Charnock</HI> observes upon the Places.</P>
<P>NOW to be <HI>Instructed,</HI> in the sense of the Text, is for a People to take Notice of the first Tokens of GOD's going from them, and to be humbled under the sense of it: to see his hand lifted up, see it and be afraid, trembling at the Thoughts of his Departure from them.</P>
<P N="2">2. THAT they <HI>Repent of</HI> and <HI>Reform</HI> those <HI>Evils,</HI> that have given him just Provocation to forsake them. GOD does not leave a People for nothing, or upon any trivial occasion: He
<PB N="24" REF="002709_0027_0FE61015F480CFA8"/>
has reason sufficient to J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stify him therein; and he will make them to <HI>know, that he has not done without a cause, all that he has done unto them.</HI> Ezek. 14 ult. And if they would be Instructed to engage the Presence of GOD still with them, they must Repent of, and put away all those GOD-provoking Evils that have excited his Holy Anger against them. Jer. 26.2, 3. <HI>Stand in the Court of the Lord's house, and speak un∣to all the Cities of Judah, which come to worship in the Lord's house, all the words that I com∣mand thee to speak unto them, diminish not a word. If so be they will hearken, and turn every man from his Evil way, that I may repent me of the Evil which I purpose to do unto them, because of the Evil of their doings.</HI> Ezek. 18.30, 31. <HI>Repent and turn yourselves from all your Trans∣gressions, so Iniquity shall not be your ruin. Cast away from you all your Transgressions where∣by ye have transgressed: for why will ye die!</HI> GOD is ready to return to a People upon their sincere Repentance, and reforming what has been the matter of Offence. An Evidence and Instance whereof you have, Judg. 10 15, 16. <HI>And the Children of Israel said unto the Lord, We have sinned, do thou unto us, whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; deliver us only we pray this day. And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the Lord: And his Soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.</HI> <Q>He acted towards them like one that felt their Sufferings, pitied them and to speak after the manner of Men, <HI>repented</HI> of his own
<PB N="25" REF="002709_0028_0FE6103B0225D5D0"/>
Proceedings against them</Q>. Reformation is the only way to recover the Presence of a De∣parting GOD, and obtain Deliverance from a Threatned Destruction. Hence the King of <HI>Nineveh</HI> exhorted and argued with his People after this manner, Jonah 3.8, 9. <HI>Let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: Yea let them turn every one from his Evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands. Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?</HI> And the Effect was answe∣rable, ver. 10. <HI>God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way, and God repented of the Evil that he had said he would do unto them, and he did it not.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. IT implies the most earnest <HI>Cries</HI> and <HI>Intreaties</HI>; that he would not utterly forsake or cast them off. That they unite their Prayers and fervent Supplications for his gracious re∣turn: expressing themselves in some such Lan∣guage as that, Psal. 80.14, 19. <HI>Return we be∣seech thee, O God of Hosts: look down from hea∣ven, and behold, and visit this vine. Turn us again, O Lord God of Hosts: cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.</HI> Jer. 14.20, 21. <HI>We acknowledge, O Lord, our wickedness, and the Iniquity of our Fathers, for we have sinned against thee. Do not abhor us for thy names sake, do not disgrace the Throne of thy Glory: remember, break not thy Covenant with us.</HI> This, GOD reasonably expects from a sinful
<PB N="26" REF="002709_0029_0FE60FE84739A7B8"/>
People; and for this very end, he threatens to remove from them. Hos. 5.14, 15. <HI>For I will</HI> (says GOD,) <HI>be unto Ephraim as a Lion, and as a young Lion to the house of Judah: I, even I will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ar and go away: I will go and re∣turn to my place, till they acknowledge their Of∣fence; and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early.</HI> And unless a People do this, they are far from receiving Instruction, and doing what in them lies to keep GOD yet a∣mong them. But I come,</P>
<P N="2">II. TO give you the <HI>Grounds</HI> of the Point, as they are laid down in the Doctrine.</P>
<P>And,</P>
<P N="1">1. IT is the <HI>Duty</HI> of a People thus to be <HI>Instructed</HI>: thus to repent of and reform every thing that has been amiss, and earnestly cry after a with drawing GOD, that he would please to stir up his Strength, and come and save them. Without this, a sinful People frustrate the Design of GOD, and lay them∣selves open to his most terrible rebukes. Zeph. 3.6, 7, 8. <HI>I have cut off the nations, their Tow∣ers are desolate, I made their streets waste, that none passeth by: their Cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none Inhabi∣tant. I said, surely thou wilt fear we: thou wilt receive instruction, so their dwelling should not be cut off: but they rose early, and corrupted all their doings. Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the Lord, until the day that I rise up to the prey: for my determination is
<PB N="27" REF="002709_0030_0FE74EFA6AA5F418"/>
to pour upon them mine Indignation, even all my fierce anger.</HI> A Refusing to be Reformed by the more gentle Strokes of GOD's hand, both adds to the People's Guilt, and exposes them to heavier and much sharper Dispensati∣ons; for GOD will by one means or other, at∣tain his End upon a provoking People. And if <HI>Rods</HI> won't do, he will Chastise them with <HI>Scorpions,</HI> yea Chastise them till he has con∣sumed them. But this brings me to say,</P>
<P N="2">2. IT is for the <HI>Interest</HI> and <HI>Safety</HI> of a People, to do their utmost to prevent the De∣parture of GOD's Soul from them. As long as he is with them, they are Safe and Happy. He will ride upon the Heavens for their help, and in his excellency upon the Skies: He will keep off wasting Judgments from them, or whatever might prove an annoyance to them. Zeph 3.16, 17. <HI>In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: and to Zion, let not thine hands be slack. The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty: he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his Love, he will joy over thee with singing.</HI> But O who can express the very sad and lamenta∣ble Condition of a People, that have once been Happy in the Enjoyment of GOD's Presence, but are now deprived of it, cast out of his sight, and called by him <HI>Loammi, Ye are not my people, and I will not be your God!</HI> There is nothing now to secure them from desolating Calamities, but they may continually expect
<PB N="28" REF="002709_0031_0FE6101AACE8D380"/>
those Judgments which shall root out their Me∣morial from under Heaven.</P>
<P>SO that if a People have any regard to their own Interest and Welfare, they can manifest it in no better way, than in a hearty Concern and strenuous Endeavour to obtain and keep the Pre∣sence of GOO with them. For if he Depart, they will soon be Desolate.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. FROM what has been said we learn upon <HI>whom</HI> a People are to lay the <HI>blame,</HI> in case GOD should at any time depart from them. He never breaks first with them; but in case they would continue Faithful to their Engage∣ments with him, he would ever be mindful of his Covenant for them. Psal. 105.8, <HI>&amp;c. He hath remembred his Covenant for ever; the word which he commanded to a thousand Genera∣tions. Which Covenant he made with Abraham, and his Oath unto Isaac; and confirmed the same unto Jacob for a Law, and to Israel for an Everlasting Covenant: saying., unto thee will I give the Land of Canaan.</HI> And notwithstand∣ing the manifold Rebellions and Provocations of that sinful People, for which he did punish them in the Wilderness; yet had he a respect unto his Promise and fulfill'd it. Hence <HI>Joshua</HI> appeals to their very Consciences for the Proof of this, Josh. 23.14. <HI>Ye know in all your hearts, and in all your souls, that not one thing hath
<PB N="29" REF="002709_0032_0FE6103B0D2F1F40"/>
failed of all the good things, which the Lord your God spake concerning you: all are come to pass unto you, and not one thing hath failed thereof.</HI> The Lord is with his People, while they are with him; but they are ever first in a Depar∣ture. And therefore whatever the sorrow∣ful Effects may be of GOD's Soul's Departing from them, they can blame none but <HI>them∣selves,</HI> and must charge the whole Fault upon their own Prevarications and treacherous Deal∣ings in his Covenant. So <HI>Israel</HI> of old were forced to do. 1 Sam. 12.10. <HI>They cried unto the Lord, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the Lord.</HI> Dan. 9.11. <HI>Yea all</HI> Israel <HI>have transgressed thy Law, even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice: therefore the Curse is poured upon us, and the Oath that is written in the Law of</HI> Moses <HI>the Servant of God, because we have sinned against him.—O Lord, Righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us Confusion of faces as at this Day.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. MAY GOD's Soul Depart from a Profes∣sing People? What a <HI>Vanity</HI> then must it be for such to <HI>Presume upon his Presence</HI> with them, meerly because of their <HI>Covenant-Relation</HI> to him? And yet thus it was with the People of the <HI>Jews</HI>: because GOD had chosen them a∣bove all other People, and taken them near to himself, they would not believe, that ever he would reject them, tho' they were guilty of the grossest abominations. Hence it was that they so readily listned to what the False Prophets
<PB N="30" REF="002709_0033_0FE60FEE5522B888"/>
said, That the City should not be delivered into the hands of the <HI>Chaldeans.</HI> But what a Vanity it was, you may see from what GOD commanded the Prophet to say unto them, Jer. 7.2, <HI>&amp;c. Stand in the gate of the Lord's house, and proclaim this word, and say, Hear the word of the Lord, all ye of</HI> Judah, <HI>that enter in at these gates to worship the Lord. Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, the God of</HI> Israel, <HI>amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place. Trust ye not in Lying words, saying,</HI> The Temple of the Lord, The Temple of the Lord, The Temple of the Lord <HI>are these. Behold, ye trust in Lying words that cannot pro∣fit.</HI> If a Professing People will allow them∣selves in those things that are a violation of the Covenant, will revolt and backslide from GOD, their External Relation to him will be no secu∣rity at all to them. He will as the Prophet's Expression is, Zech. 11.10. <HI>Cut asunder the staff, even</HI> Beauty, <HI>that he may break his Cove∣nant which he had made with the People.</HI> It is O∣bedience and Faithfulness to GOD, that will en∣gage, his Presence with a People, and not any Profession or Covenant Relation, that they may make, or stand in to him.</P>
<P N="3">3. DO'S the Departure of GOD from a People, <HI>open a Door for Desolating Judgments,</HI> and is it their <HI>Duty</HI> and <HI>Interest</HI> to do all they can to <HI>prevent his Removal?</HI> This then plainly Instructs us what the Duty and present Business of this People is.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="002709_0034_0FE6103C1A7C7CB0"/>THAT GOD is Departing, and upon his way from us, is too plain to be denied. Every one that observes any thing cannot but see and take notice of it.</P>
<P>GOD has been marching up and down the Land in Indignation and Wrath, visiting our Iniquities, and punishing our Transgressions by a Series of Judgments; and yet we are not Humbled nor Reformed to this very Day. He has given us frequent and solemn warning of his Departure, and there are those things most certainly to be found among us, which are aw∣ful Presages of his forsaking us.</P>
<P>IF we compare our selves with <HI>Israel</HI> of old, our manners with theirs, we shall find that there was scarce any Sin they were chargeable with, (save their more gross <HI>Idolatry,</HI>) but the same may be found among our selves. And what can we plead why GOD should not leave us as he did them? Are not our forgetfulness of GOD and Disobedience to his Commands, our Rebellions and Lustings, our Perfidy and Murmurings equal to theirs? And besides the Evils mentioned under the <HI>Second Doctrine</HI>; and as to the more heinous Transgressions of the Law, <HI>Oppression</HI> and <HI>Injustice, Drunken∣ness</HI> and <HI>Uncleanness, Lying, Swearing,</HI> and <HI>Prophaning</HI> the <HI>Name</HI> and <HI>Day</HI> of GOD, we must confess that the Land is full of Sin, and deserves to be forsaken of the Holy One of Israel.</P>
<P>WE have in a very shameful degree forgot∣ten our Fathers GOD, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for which that Pious Generation follow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d him into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> then

waste and howling Wilderness. And GOD may now expostulate with and chide us just as he did Backsliding <HI>Israel,</HI> whom we are so very like unto, Jer. 2.2, 5, 31. <HI>Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the Lord, I remember thee, the kindness of thy Youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou iventest after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown. Thus saith the Lord, What iniquity have your Fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain? 0 Generation, see ye the word of the Lord: have I been a wilderness unto Isra∣el? a land of darkness? Wherefor, say my people, We are lords, we will come no more unto thee?</HI> Iniquity abounds, and the Love of many waxes cold. Where is that Zeal for GOD, and Af∣fection to his Ordinances and Ways, which our Fathers were eminent for? Real vital Pi∣ety is under a dreadful decay, and languishes daily. Men content themselves with a <HI>form</HI> of Godliness, without the <HI>power</HI> of it, with a <HI>name</HI> to live, when really they are dead. A Carnal, Selfish and Worldly Spirit prevails, and threatens to eat out the heart of Religion and a Formal <HI>Liolicean</HI> Indifferency is what the most of Professors are dangerously Sick of, and it will be well if they don't Die of the Distemper. The SPIRIT is withdrawn, and there is but little of that Power and Efficacy attending the Word and Ordinances which for∣merly there was. All which are Evidences of GOD's Departing.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="002709_0036_0FE610020CA52308"/>AND is our GOD going from us, and shall we be secure and quiet? Shan't we bitterly re∣sent the awful tokens of it? and cry more ear∣nestly after him than ever an Idolatrous <HI>Micah</HI> did after the Children of <HI>Dan,</HI> when they had taken away his Dunghil-Deities?</P>
<P>O let it not be said of us under such a Dispen∣sation, as it was once complained of, Isa. 64.7. <HI>And there is none that caileth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee.</HI></P>

<P N="4">4. LET it be of <HI>Instruction</HI> and <HI>Exhortation</HI> to all, in their several Capacities, <HI>to do what they can to prevent</HI> GOD's Total and Final De∣parture from this People.</P>
<P>AND to Encourage you hereto I will say, That GOD is not wholly gone from us; and as to the Degrees of his Presence that seem to be removed, they also are recoverable.</P>
<P>GOD has still a Favour for our Land; and if we would but Repent of and Reform the E∣vils that are in the midst of us, he would soon cause his Anger towards us to cease. Yea he would revive us again, and cause his People to rejoyce in him. Let every one then chearfully lend a hand, and contribute all he can to so good a work as that of Reformation is.</P>
<P>AND here,</P>

who contrary to my own Expectation and In∣clination, have order'd me into this Desk to Day.</P>
<P>AND the Message, which now arrives unto you from HIM who standeth in the Congre∣gation of the Mighty, and judgeth among the <HI>Gods,</HI> is</P>
<P>THAT <HI>you Improve all your Power, Interest, and influence to engage the gracious Presence of G0D with this Poor People.</HI></P>
<P>CIVIL Rulers are GOD's Vice-gerents on Earth, and in Scripture-Language wear the Honourable Title of <HI>Gods,</HI> (Psal. 82.1, 6.) Which speaks not only their Dignity and Au∣thority, the Honour and Obedience which is their Due; but also the special Obligations lying upon them, to Imitate the Great GOD by whom they Rule, to be concern'd for his Glory in the World, and be the most Extensive Blessings unto others.</P>
<P>AND in what way can you better Evidence your selves so? than by doing all that in you lies, that there may be a Reformation of those Evils, which threaten us with the Loss of God's Favour, and due Encouragement given to those things, which will be so many Tokens for Good that GOD will not leave and forsake us.</P>
<P>IF then you will permit the meanest of the Lord's Servants to be your Monitor, to put you in Remembrance of those things which we trust you know and are established in the Be∣lief of, I would with all possible Deference sug∣gest a few things briefly.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="002709_0038_0FE610039982F5C8"/>IT is without Controversy a Duty indispen∣sably Incumbent upon the <HI>Civil Magistrate</HI> (who is <HI>Custos Utriusque Tabula</HI>) to see to it, that the <HI>Glorious G0D he acknowledged and worship'd</HI> according to his own <HI>Prescription</HI> and <HI>Institution,</HI> without the addition of <HI>Humane Inventions.</HI></P>
<P>THAT the <HI>Religion</HI> of the <HI>Second Command∣ment</HI> be maintain'd and kept <HI>pure,</HI> especially where a <HI>peculiar Regard</HI> to it has been the <HI>prin∣cipal Foundation</HI> of a <HI>People's Settlement,</HI> as is our <HI>own Case</HI> most certainly.</P>
<P>THAT the <HI>Great and Dreadful Name of G0D</HI> be <HI>reverenc'd</HI> and <HI>fear'd</HI>; and that the Breakers of the <HI>Third Commandment</HI> by Pro∣fane Oaths and Hellish Curses be not suffered, to escape a just Punishment from Men.</P>
<P>THAT the <HI>Holy Sabbath</HI> of the Lord, which he himself has Sanctified, be Religiously obser∣ved, and every thing tending to the violation of it discountenanced and suppress'd: that his <HI>Publick Worship</HI> be attended, and the <HI>Ministry</HI> of the Word suitably provided for.</P>
<P>AND this leads me naturally to say, It is incumbent upon YOU the Rulers of our Peo∣ple, to take effectual Care, that those who are devoted to the Service of the Sanctuary, and called to wait at the Altar, be partakers with the Altar. I mean as the Apostle expounds it, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.14. that according to Divine Ordina∣tion, <HI>they which preach the Gospel, should live of the gospel.</HI> That the <HI>Ministers of CHRIST and Religion</HI> should have an <HI>honourable Support</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="002709_0039_0FE60FEE60A15908"/>
from those among whom they spend their Thought, Time and Strength; and not be forced, in ways unbecoming their Station and Character, to provide for themselves and Fami∣lies: or else be reduced to Penury and Want, which in this Worldly-minded and Gospel∣glutted Age, will effectually bring not only the Clergy themselves, but the very Office of the Ministry into the greatest Contempt. It is recorded to the Everlasting Honour of that good King <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> (2 Chron. 30.22.) that he <HI>spake comfortably unto all the</HI> Levites <HI>that taught the good knowledge of the lord.</HI> He assu∣red them of his Princely Favour and Paternal Care, and that nothing on his part should be wanting for their Encouragement and Comfort. And of that Excellent Governour <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> who truly sought the Welfare of the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> it is observ'd, Neh. 13.10, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> That when he <HI>perceived that the Portions of the Le∣vites had not been given them,</HI> he <HI>contended about it,</HI> and took speedy Care for the redress of their Grievances. And from the Steps alrea∣dy taken by the Government, will our Honoura∣ble Rulers now allow the <HI>Oppressed</HI> Ministers of JESUS CHRIST humbly to hope, that this Matter shall have a Thorough Consideration with them: that by means hereof, thro' the Thanksgiving of many on your account, Glory may redound to GOD.</P>
<P>Again, IT lies upon yon our Fathers in the Goverment, to have a singular Concern for the <HI>Means of Education,</HI> and training up of Youth
<PB N="37" REF="002709_0040_0FE61003A3DD3A88"/>
for Future Service: that <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Learn∣ing,</HI> which have been our <HI>Distinguishing Glory</HI> among the Provinces, may flourish abundantly. That <HI>Inferiour Schools</HI> may be cherish'd, and the <HI>College</HI> in special, which GOD has made so great a Blessing to this People from the begin∣ning, tenderly regarded and encouraged; the True Interest of it; ever lie <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ar your Hearts, and be vigorously pursued. May that <HI>Society</HI> always live before GOD.—May the wide Breach made upon it be happily repair<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d.—And may it ever be a Seminary of <HI>Piety</HI> and the most useful <HI>Knowledge.</HI></P>
<P>Again, THE Honour of GOD calls for it, that you exert all that Authority and Power he has vested you with, for the Suppression of those <HI>growing Evils,</HI> such as <HI>horrible Injustice</HI> and <HI>cruel Extortion, Uncleanness, Intempe∣rance, Lying, Stealing</HI> and the like, which like a mighty Torrent, threaten to carry all before them. Thus must you be a <HI>Terror to Evil∣doers.</HI></P>
<P>Furthermore, IT concerns Civil Rulers to see to it that the <HI>Publick Faith</HI> be preserv'd In∣violate and Sacred; that the <HI>Publick Credit</HI> be as good or better Security than any Private Bond can be; that those who serve the best Interests of it, be no sufferers by a Failure here∣in, but may be able with just reason and pro∣priety to use this Speech, The Lord bless thee, <HI>O Habitation of Justice and Mountain of Holi∣ness.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="002709_0041_0FE60FF1032557F8"/>In fine, CIVIL Rulers are to be themselves shining <HI>Patterns of Religion</HI> and <HI>Godliness</HI>; to go before their People in every thing that is vertuous and praise-worthy, and by their holy unblameable Conversation provoke others to an Imitation of them; This will be a good Means to promote the Blessed work of <HI>Reforma∣tion</HI> among us, which will be for the length∣ning out of our Tranquillity.</P>
<P>SUFFER then the word of Exhortation, which speaketh to you as unto Rulers, Ezra 10.4. <HI>Arise, for this matter belongeth unto you.</HI> And may all the Lord's People be with you, in their earnest Supplications and Payers, that the GOD of Heaven would put this Honour upon you, of making you the <HI>Instrumental Saviours</HI> of a sinful sinking People, that are in many re∣spects brought very Low. <HI>so let the Lord our God be with you, and let all the People say,</HI> Amen.</P>
<P N="2">2. LET me apply my self to my <HI>Reverend Fathers and Brethren</HI> in the <HI>Ministry</HI>: who, 'tis to be hop'd, will look upon themselves in this Day of sad Degeneracy, peculiarly obliged to do their utmost, that GOD may not be pro∣voked finally to depart from this People. This is no more than what GOD and Man justly ex∣pect from us, and our Office binds us to.</P>
<P>WE are Watchmen upon <HI>Jerusalem</HI>'s Walls, whose proper Business it is to des<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y Dangers,
<PB N="39" REF="002709_0042_0FE6103C25709C28"/>
and give seasonable Notice thereof: to observe the Sins of the Times, and the awful Symp∣toms of GOD's Departure, and thereupon to <HI>Cry aloud, an spare not, lift up our voices like a Trumpet, and shew the People their Transgres∣sions.</HI> Nor can we hold our Peace, and be Guiltless. We are to warn the wicked, that they turn from their Evil ways, and by Pro∣mises and Threatnings, Counsels, Exhortati∣ons and Entreaties, do what we can to engage them to Repentance, as ever we would be Pure from their Blood, and obtain the Divine Favour for them. A Flaming Zeal for the Honour of GOD and against Sin, should ever inspire and influence us. We must rise up a∣gainst the Evil Doers, and stand up for GOD against the Workers of Iniquity; and whether Men will hear, or whether they will forbear, we may not fail to bear a due Testimony a∣gainst the GOD-provoking Evils that are to be found in the midst of us.</P>
<P>NOR is all this enough, but it concerns us also by the peculiar Sanctity of our Lives to condemn the Practices of the World and show Men the way to Heaven; that others in fol∣lowing us may not fail to obtain Eternal Bles∣sedness. We should shine in our Conversations, as well as burn in our Doctrine, and be Patterns of good Works.</P>
<P>A Difficult Service we truly have, attended with more than ordinary Temptations and Dis∣couragements:
<PB N="40" REF="002709_0043_0FE6101C61F23F20"/>
however it is a Good Work, and we serve a Good Master in it; and therefore let us not sink under our Burden of Service for GOD, or of Suffering from an ungrateful World, but in an humble Dependance upon the Strength and Grace of CHRIST, labour to ap∣prove our selves Faithful unto him that hath Called us. Let us heartily grieve and mourn for the Evils which we can't Reform, and at the same time improve all the Interest we have in Heaven, that GOD's Soul may not be dis∣joynted from us. Joel 2.17. <HI>Let the Priests the Ministers of the Lord, weep between the Porch and the Altar, and let them say, Spare thy People, O Lord.</HI></P>
<P>YEA tho' we may have too much reason to bewail the unsuccessfulness of our endeavours, that we <HI>labour in vain,</HI> and <HI>spend our strength for noughts</HI>: Yet let this be our Comfort, that surely our Judgment is with the Lord, and our work with our GOD. Though <HI>Israel</HI> be not gathered, yet shall we be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, and our GOD will be our Strength and exceeding great Reward.</P>
<P>IN the last place,</P>
<P N="3">3. LET it be a solemn Call to this whole <HI>People,</HI> to <HI>return every Man from his Evil way,</HI> and <HI>amend his doings,</HI> that GOD's Soul may not abhor us.</P>
<P>AS ever we value the Favour of GOD and desire to be Happy in the Enjoyment of it, let
<PB N="41" REF="002709_0044_0FE6104392C08598"/>
us put away our abominations out of his fight, and beware of every thing that may provoke him to leave us: complying with that his voice to us at this Day, Isa. 1.16, 17. <HI>Wash ye make you clean, put away the Evil of your doings from before mine eyes, cease to do evil, learn to do well.</HI> Let every one <HI>Repent of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? Be as a Dove in the valley, mourning for his own Ini∣quity,</HI> and besufre to Reform what has been amiss in his own Heart and Life.—And Oh that there were this token for Good among us, that GOD will not forsake us, even the pour∣ing forth a Spirit of <HI>Supplication</HI> and <HI>Reforma∣tion</HI> upon this whole People, that being sensible of his Anger, we may follow hard after him, by fervent Prayer hold him fast, and resolve that we will not let him go!—Oh that it might be said of us, as of those, 1 Sam. 7.2. <HI>And all the house of Israel lamented after the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>WERE it once come to this, he would soon <HI>arise for our help, and redeem us for his mercies sake.</HI>—Then would the Lord <HI>awake as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine; then would he smite our ene∣mies as in the binder parts; and put them to a perpetual Reproach.</HI>—Then should the <HI>Earth yield her increase, and God, even our own God would Bless us.</HI>—Then would he extricate us out of all our <HI>Difficulties,</HI> and continue to us the Enjoyment of all our <HI>Pleasant things.</HI> In a word, then would he <HI>cause the Righ∣teousness
<PB N="42" REF="002709_0045_0FE60FF10D75CD00"/>
of our Jerusalem to go forth as bright∣ness, and the Salvation thereof as a Lamp that burneth</HI>: Yea in every respect it would be said of us, as of <HI>Israel</HI> of old, Deut. 33.29. <HI>Hap∣py art thou, O Israel: who is like unto thee, O People saved by the Lord!</HI></P>
<P><HI>NOW the Lord, which made Heaven and Earth, bless yen all out of Zion: and cause you to see the good of Jerusalem, all the Days of your Lives. — And Return O Lord to the many Thousands of Israel!</HI></P>
