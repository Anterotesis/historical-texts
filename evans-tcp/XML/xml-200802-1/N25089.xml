<P>HAVING applied to practice, in the General Hospital, at Calcutta, those medical Principles, vulgarly known by the Name of the Brunonian Doctrine; and being convinced, from the Result, of their Conformity to truth; we think it may be useful to attempt to promulgate the Doctrine in India, where it seems to be almost wholly unknown, and to call forth the Attention of medical Men, to a Subject so worthy of In∣vestigation.</P>
<P>SOME Cases are annexed, in illustration of the Mode, in which, according to our Ideas, the Principles of the Doctrine should be applied to practice.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>UPON examining the records of medicine, from the earliest periods, it appears that phy∣sicians have never considered the living body as subject, like all other parts of the universe, to regular and immutable laws; but seem actually to have drawn an opposite conclusion. It is from this circumstance principally, that the practice of medicine has hitherto acquired so small a portion of certainty, as still to merit the appellation bestowed upon it, more than two thousand years ago, of a "conjectural art."</P>
<P>THE various doctrines which have been pub∣lished to the world, regarding the human body, are in general, nothing more than a mere as∣semblage of words, without the power of con∣veying any distinct ideas. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As truth is but one, and the hypothesis, which may be formed upon any given subject, infinite; so the chance of any hypothesis being true, is as one is to an infinite number; or the certainty of its being erroneous, absolute. Every just deduction of reasoning, is properly called theory. But these terms are, to the great detriment of science, very generally confounded.</NOTE>Hypothesis has suc∣ceeded
<PB N="18" REF="033254_0010_0ff6a76840cffe18"/>
hypothesis, in the same regular manner, that physician has succeeded physician. Opi∣nions have been adopted, according to the chances of education; supported by the au∣thority of great names; and religiously adhered to, as fundamental axioms, into the truth of which it would have been heresy to enquire.</P>
<P>THE mischiefs arising from this source,
<Q>greatly extend their influence, and spread in every possible direction, when error acquires the patronage of authority, and the protection of dignified names. It then takes its chair in the schools, and assumes the pompous titles of profound, refined, or liberal know∣ledge. Raised to this eminence, the indus∣try of a single teacher, or author, may cor∣rupt thousands; that of a few, whole na∣tions; and the addition of a proportional number, ruin the education of a world.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THIS universal diffusion of error, receives sanction and establishment from the progress of time. It becomes venerable: and every attempt to detect it, is branded with the name of profanity or madness.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Introduction to the Outlines, &amp;c. by John Brown, p. ii.</NOTE> Such has, un∣happily, been too long the state of science.
<PB N="19" REF="033254_0011_0ff6a76a9f90b810"/>
But, of late years, every department of human knowledge has undergone a rapid improvement. The dawn of reason has, in a particular degree, begun to enlighten the medical world; and the practice to assume a consistency, which could only be founded on the discovery of the laws, by which all living bodies are governed.</P>
<P>THIS discovery, one of the grandest efforts of the human mind, that ever dignified the page of science, the discoveries of the immortal Newton himself not excepted, is contained in the Elements of Medicine, of the late celebrated John Brown. This discovery, hitherto neg∣lected from ignorance, opposed from the shame of recantation, and calumniated from interest, prejudice, and passion, contains so many unde∣niable truths that, to an unbiassed mind, it only requires to be known, in order to be admired and adopted. The doctrine, although it has not yet been sanctioned by the medical schools of Britain, has, however▪ been very generally re∣ceived, in the other schools of Europe, and in America. "In the University of Pavia," says Dr. Rasori,
<Q>undoubtedly one of the first in Europe, there is hardly a student endowed with talents, who is not a Brunonian. The doctrine begins equally to spread in Ger∣many. Many of the periodical publications of that country have noticed it, and the Ele∣menta
<PB N="20" REF="033254_0012_0ff6a76d9eadbab0" MS="y"/>
have lately been published there. A friend at Genoa assures me, that several sur∣geons to French men of war have informed him, that Brown is known and much admired in France. In the University of Pavia, Brown is in high esteem, even with some of the most respectable professors; and in other parts of Italy, I can assert, from my own knowledge, that old physicians have not refus∣ed their sanction to many of the Brunonian principles.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Beddoes' Life of Brown.</NOTE></P>
<P>ONE of his Italian critics, supposed to be Professor Carminati, says,
<Q>Quaerenti mihi causas incredibilis prope illius commotionis ani∣morum, atque ingentis feré plausus, quibus nuperimè singularis illa hypothesis, cui novum Universae Medicinae Systema celebrismus An∣gliae Scriptor et Medicus BRUNO superstruxit, ab iis optimae spei adolescentibus excepta esset, qui in florentissimo Ticinensi Archigymnasio sa∣lutaris artis studiis omnibus mecum incumbunt, peraduum sane, non fuit eas **** invenire.</Q></P>
<P>MANY translations and editions of this work, and various criticisms upon it, have appeared in different parts of Europe, which it is by no means necessary to enumerate here. That
<PB N="21" REF="033254_0013_0ff6a717a1534fa0"/>
the knowledge of it has also made a considerable progress, among the medical philosophers of America, is evident, from the frequent allusions made to it, in a late publication, by Dr. Rush, of Philadelphia.
<Q>The principle of the gradu∣al application of stimuli to the body, in all the diseases of indirect debility on the one hand, and of direct on the other, opens a wide field for the improvement of medicine. Perhaps all the discoveries of future ages, will consist more in a new application of establish∣ed principle, and in new modes of exhibiting old medicine, than in the discoveries of new theories, or of new articles of the Materia Medica.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> "An Account of the bilious remitting yellow Fe∣ver,"—<HI>page 284.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>ANOTHER proof of the excellence of the doc∣trine, no less convincing, is deducible from the frequent plagiarisms of its fundamental princi∣ples, by which some men, desirous of passing them upon the world as their own discoveries, have lately endeavoured to establish a reputation for superior genius. Any attempt to detect these, in their various and most infinite ramifi∣cations, would, as Dr. Beddoes <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It would be injustice, upon this occasion, to pass over, without a tribute of applause, the laudable exertions of Dr. Beddoes, in promulgating the knowledge of Brown's doctrine, He is perhaps the only author in Britain, who has dared pub∣lickly to assert the merits of it. This ingenious conduct, and the liberal manner in which he stepped forward, to benefit the unfortunate family of our illustrious philosopher,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide a new edition of the Elements of Medicine, of John Brown, M. D. with a biographical Preface by Thomas Bed∣does, M. D.</NOTE> equally evince his superior mind, and universal philanthropy.</NOTE> very justly re∣marks,
<PB N="22" REF="033254_0014_0ff6a719d5b53870"/>
be now unnecessary. Among the most conspicuous, however, in this list, we may par∣ticularise Doctor Gritanner.—There is not a single idea in any of the papers, which he has published upon that subject, that is not borrow∣ed from the Doctrine of Brown, or the different modifications of it, discussed in the Medical So∣ciety of Edinburgh, and recorded upon its books. These he has freely used, without the smallest acknowledgment. His doctrine, of the principle of irritability, is taken from a paper, written by a respectable member of that Society.</P>
<P>DR. G. was a student at Edinburgh, long af∣ter the publication of the <HI>Elementa Medicinae;</HI> and at a time, when the principles of the doc∣trine, were the subject of investigation, in the literary societies of that University. His plagia∣risms must therefore have been wilful; and no acknowledgment, subsequent to detection, can
<PB N="23" REF="033254_0015_0ff6a71ce8f22d80" MS="y"/>
be considered as an atonement. There is some∣thing so flagitious in the attempt to rob departed genius of its honours—honours too, in the ac∣quisition of which friendships, emolument, and ease, were all sacrificed,—that it cannot be too severely reprobated.</P>
<P>IT is a common and often a true observation, that "no man is a prophet in his own country." Accordingly, it appears, that this doctrine was longer neglected, and is still more anxiously op∣posed in Britain, than in other nations. Few men at an advanced period of life, have sufficient courage to relinquish sentiments to which they have been habituated, from their early years; fewer still have candour enough to acknowledge the truth of what they have strenuously opposed; and young men, although generally open to con∣viction, seldom have sufficient confidence in them∣selves, to stem the torrent of general opinion. The rising generation, however, in order to adopt the new doctrine, will not have many sacrifices to make. It will neither <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffect their interest, nor wound their vanity.</P>
<P>THAT the force of truth already begins to si∣lence the unmeaning clamour, which has hither∣to been made against this doctrine in Baitain, is evinced, by the reception of a late volumi∣nous publication, of which the chief merit con∣sists
<PB N="24" REF="033254_0016_0ff769a76c45f048" MS="y"/>
in, an occasional and imperfect coincidence with the principles of Brown. It will readily be perceived, that we allude to the Zoonomia of Dr. Darwin,—a work which, from the excel∣lent character and reputed talents of its author, had raised considerable expectation in the public mind. But disappointment, on the perusal, was in proportion to the previous expectation. In∣stead of important and luminous corrections of the doctrine, which might have been looked for, at this time of day, from a man of abili∣ties, pursuing the same track of investigation, a want of argument and correct reasoning, is found to pervade the whole. It is such a <HI>rudis indigesta∣que molis</HI> that, after wading through nearly six hundred pages,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At the time this was written, the first volume only, of Darwin's Zoonomia, appeared in India.</NOTE> it seems impossible to compre∣hend the scientific principles, upon which the author intended to build his doctrine. From these strictures, it ought not to be inferred, that we wish to detract from the merits of the excel∣lent poet, who has so elegantly sung the "Loves of the Plants." But justice forbids that, out of respect to character or reputation, one man should be allowed to assume to himself, any por∣tion of that honour, which exclusively belongs to another. Science knows no personal distinc∣tions.
<PB N="25" REF="033254_0017_0ff7699fb500dce8"/>
The author of a grand discovery, is, at least, entitled to posthumous fame.</P>
<P>THE ORIGIN of this, like every other discovery of importance, has been attempted to be traced to hints thrown out by preceding authors. E∣ven the visionary speculations of Cullen, have been mentioned, as the source, of some of its fundamental principles:—with just as much pro∣priety might they he imputed to any ingenious suggestion in "The life and Opinions of Tris∣tram Shandy." Upon the whole, it may with confidence be asserted, that this doctrine is, in all its parts, original, as it is undoubtedly true, and important in its application. And those, who are disposed to deny it this merit, should, in decency, adduce something like argu∣ment, instead of the ebullitions of vanity, de∣traction, or jealousy.</P>
<P>AFTER this eulogy, the reader may perhaps expect, that the following pages contain a mere verbal copy of Brown's <HI>Elements of Medicine</HI>; but he will soon perceive, that this is not the case. For, although its fundamental principles are in∣disputably true, there are several errors in the detail, and some of them of very considerable importance. His opponents, however, if truth had been their object, should have endeavoured to perfect the doctrine, by a correction of its errors, instead of illiberally affecting, on ac∣count
<PB N="26" REF="033254_0018_0ff7699e3166f130"/>
of partial blemishes, to reject the whole. To the candid, liberal, and enlightened, it will appear much less wonderful, that Brown should have some times erred, than that he should have been so pre-eminently successful, in first pointing out, to the world, the right path of medical in∣vestigation.</P>
<P>THE principal deviations, from the original doctrine, to be found in the following
<Q>View of the Science of Life,</Q>
are these:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1st.—It is demonstrated, that diseases of exces∣sive excitement cannot exist; and that all those, which have been so called, are diseases of in∣direct debility.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2dly.—ALMOST the whole of the diseases, which were ranked, by Brown, and his follow∣ers, among the diseases of direct debility, are shewn to be diseases of indirect debility.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3dly.—IN the mode of applying the exciting powers, for the cure of diseases of indirect debi∣debility.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>FROM this statement, it appears, that the al∣terations, here made in the doctrine, as they affect the method of cure, in more than one half of the diseases, to which living bodies are subject, are of the first importance; and there∣fore deserve a candid examination.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="033254_0019_0ff769ad0fbca7f0"/>IT may be proper to remark, that some per∣sons have affected to reject this doctrine, upon the very grave and solemn ground, of its being favourable to intemperance. To those however, who will take the trouble of making themselves acquainted with its principles, it will only be necessary to observe, that such persons do not understand the subject.</P>
<P>IN climates and countries where the transition, from health to disease, and from disease to death, is often alarmingly rapid, and health always pre∣carious, the knowledge of a doctrine, which re∣duces the practice of medicine to a degree of cer∣tainty hitherto unknown, cannot but be attend∣ed with great and evident advantages. To dif∣fuse that knowledge in India, where the doctrine seems to have been but little cultivated, and so have acquired but a small degree of reputation so justly due to it, is the design of this undertak∣ing. The attempt is made with the greater con∣fidence, from having experienced, in the appli∣cation of the principles to practice, a degree of success, far beyond even the most sanguine expec∣tations, that had previously been formed in theory. If, however, this confidence should not, after a fair investigation, be justified by the experience of others, the subject remains open for free dis∣cussion,
<PB N="28" REF="033254_0020_0ff769ae919436b0"/>
by which alone the doctrine must, final∣ly, be either confirmed, or refuted.</P>
<P>AS it is, for obvious reasons, desireable, that a knowledge of medical science, should not be ex∣clusively confined to medical men, we have en∣tirely divested our observations of the mysterious garb, in which such knowledge is usually con∣veyed to the world.</P>

<HEAD>1. Diseases of direct Debility, or of Accumulation.</HEAD>
<P N="13">XIII. As the body becomes susceptible of im∣pression, in the direct ratio of subduction of sti∣muli (v. 1.), it follows that the force of stimu∣lus to be applied, in the cure of diseases, of this state, should be inversely as the accumulation of the excitability. Thus in the case of persons who have been exposed to great degrees of cold, heat should be applied, first in a degree not much greater than the lowest temperature, to which the person has been exposed, and gradually increased to the usual standard. To frozen limbs, the
<PB N="34" REF="033254_0026_0ff6a78a2c8f9f90"/>
first application should be snow, then cold wa∣ter, afterwards water less cold, and so on, through the various degrees, until motion and sensation are fully restored. Whereas, by the immediate application of the accustomed degree of heat, death would be produced in the whole, or those parts of the body, which had been exposed.— To persons who may have remained long without food, nourishment should be exhibited in the same gradual manner. The quantity usually ta∣ken at a meal would, in such a case, instantly extinguish life,— a fact of which there are many instances upon record. The eyes of persons, who have been long kept in darkness, become exceedingly sensible to the smallest degree of light. Those unfortunate beings, whom the mis∣taken and perverse policy of man has doomed to long confinement in dungeons, become, in the course of time, capable of distinguishing all the corners of their gloomy abode; where, upon their first entrance, they could distinguish nothing. The impression of the full glare of a meridian light, upon organs in such a state of susceptibility, would occasion instant and irreco∣verable blindness. A person, suddenly awoke in the night, can scarcely bear even the small de∣gree of light, emitted from a common candle. It is only by the gradual approach of day, that the eye is enabled to bear the full force of the mid-day sun.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="033254_0027_0ff6a78d8e8b1948"/>SCURVY seems to be a disease of direct debili∣ty, occasioned by the absence of some of the usual exciting powers, particularly nutritive food, heat, and the mental stimuli. These powers must be gradually applied, in order to re-produce health. Upon this principle it is, that vegitables and vegi∣table acids, as being less stimulant than fresh ani∣mal food, are found so useful in the cure of scurvy. An immediate indulgence in the latter, after a long abstinence, would produce dangerous consequen∣ces. In advanced stages of this disease, a very small quantity of stimulus, such as a glass of ardent spi∣rits, or a strong mental impulse, has been frequent∣ly known to extinguish life. That diminution of heat has a share in the production of scurvy, is evi∣dent from its more frequent occurrence in cold, than in hot climates. And that the absence of the mental stimuli, is often a source of this disease, is obvious from this,—that every circumstance that can occur, during a long voyage, calculated to rouse the mind to moderate exertion, will pro∣duce an alleviation of the symptoms;—the sight of an enemy—the sight of land—approach to the de∣stined port—the anticipation of the pleasures of the shore, &amp;c. This is farther corroborated by the frequency of scurvy among the enslaved Afri∣cans, in their passage to the West Indies, where all the mental stimuli are as completely abstract∣ed, as can be supposed to happen in almost any
<PB N="36" REF="033254_0028_0ff6a78f90e13290"/>
possible situation. The disease in this case affects the men, more than the women and children. The reason is evident. With men, the transiti∣on from liberty to slavery, is greater than with women and children, accustomed, in their most free state, to look up to them as their superiors. The minds of the latter too, from being less ex∣ercised, are the less capable of reflection, and become more easily reconciled to their new situa∣tion; which is also rendered less irksome, by the indulgence usually granted to them, even on board of ships, employed in the vile traffic of slaves.</P>
<P>THE absence of those objects, which were wont to excite pleasurable sensation in the mind, pro∣duce diseases of this state.—Such is the despond∣ence of a lover, in the absence of the object be∣loved: and that melancholy, with which some persons are affected, when absent from their na∣tive country.</P>
<P N="14">XIV.—AS the situations, in which the ordi∣nary stimuli can be with-held, in any considera∣ble degree, are rare, the diseases of this state are consequently few in number; and seldom be∣come objects of medical treatment.</P>
<P N="15">XV.—IN all of them, the cure consists in a gradual re-application of those exciting powers,
<PB N="37" REF="033254_0029_0ff6a7921ee8a8a0"/>
the abstraction of which occasioned the disease; or, in situations where that is impracticable, by a similar application of other powers equivalent in force.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>2.—Diseases of indirect Debility, or of Exhaustion.</HEAD>
<P N="16">XVI.—AS the body becomes less susceptible of impression, in the direct ratio of the excessive application of stimuli (v. iii), it follows that the force of stimulus to be applied, in the cure of diseases of this state, should be directly as the exhaustion of the excitability.</P>
<P N="17">XVII.—AS all diseases arise, either from accu∣mulation or exhaustion of the excitability, (vi.) and as the diseases of accumulation have been shewn to be extremely few (xiv), diseases of in∣direct will probably be to those of direct debility, in some such proportion, as nine hundred and ninety nine to one. The diseases of warm cli∣mates may be considered, without exception, as diseases of exhaustion, or of indirect debility.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII.—AS the highest excitement is the greatest degree of health, it is evident that, in disease, health is to be reproduced, by the ap∣plication of such a degree of stimulant power, as is calculated to support the highest state of ex∣citement, of which the body, at the time, is
<PB N="38" REF="033254_0030_0ff6a7964ad91980"/>
capable. Let the middle state of the excitability for instance, be represented by 20, and the appro∣priate degree of stimulus, producing healthy ex∣citement, by 20 also (vide Table); let the dimi∣nishing or increasing sum of stimulus, in propor∣tion to the accumulation or exhaustion of the ex∣citability, be represented by numbers, as in the annexed table. If the excitability is exhausted to 10, the sum of stimulus to be applied, in or∣der to produce the greatest excitement, which the state of the body will allow, will be as 30. Every degree of stimulus, beyond that, will exhaust the body still farther, and every degree, below it, will retard the cure. Thus 35 degrees of stimu∣lus will be too much, 25 too little.</P>
<P N="19">XIX.—AS the production of the healthy state is always gradual and progressive, and is effected by the powers of life; it follows that, in proportion to the degree, in which these powers can be maintained, the cure will be accelerated. There is no other mode of supporting them, but by an application of stimuli, proportionate to the susceptibility of impression.</P>
<P N="20">XX.—AS the sum of the powers, producing disease, cannot possibly be ascertained, the degree of stimulus to be applied, for the reproduction of health, must be entirely regulated by observation
<PB N="39" REF="033254_0031_0ff6a799e1340000"/>
of the effects, arising from the application of me∣dicines.</P>
<P N="21">XXI.—AS the varieties of diseases that occur, from the highest degree of accumulation, to the lowest degree of exhaustion, of excitability; so is the variety, in the degree of stimulus, necessary to be applied, for the cure.</P>
<P N="22">XXII.—THIS variety is of very great extent. The usual mode, therefore, of prescribing certain fixed doses of medicines, in every disease, what∣ever may be the degree of it, is and must be nugatory and inefficacious; excepting when these doses happen, by mere chance, to correspond with the state of excitability.—In ascertaining these degrees, and proportioning the stimuli, consist the judgment of the physician.</P>
<P N="23">XXIII.—IF, for example, opium, aether, vo∣latile alkali, the preparations of mercury, wine, bark, &amp;c. exhibited in the usual doses, do not produce effects, which indicate an approximation to health,—such as a diminution of frequency,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is sometimes a peculiar slowness, which is equal∣ly a sign of debility, with a quickness of pulse. Vide Case 8th.</NOTE> and an increase of strength, in the pulse, a cool∣ness of the skin, moisture of the tongue, refresh∣ing sleep, and the other familiar signs of increas∣ing
<PB N="40" REF="033254_0032_0ff6a72aa76d1808"/>
excitement,—it is evident that the doses are insufficient, and should be increased, until these effects are produced.</P>
<P N="24">XXIV.—THE doses should be repeated in such a manner, as to maintain the highest degree of excitement, of which the body, at the time is capable. But in proportion as the excitability accumulates, or the body approaches to the state of health, the doses should be gradually and pro∣portionally diminished, until at length, health being established, nothing more than the action of the ordinary exciting powers is required.</P>
<P N="25">XXV.—ALL the diseases enumerated by Brown, as diseases of accumulation or direct debi∣lity, with perhaps the single exception of scur∣vy, are diseases of exhaustion. Typhus, Inter∣mittents, Dysentery, and some other diseases, as they appear to be occasioned by exposure to cold, and moisture, a deficiency of nutriment and of other stimuli, have been ranked, by him, in the class of diseases of accumulation. But as the sum of the powers, which are concerned in the pro∣duction of any particular disease, cannot be ascer∣tained, the nature of it can only be determined by the effects of the stimulant powers, applied for the cure. And, as the cure of these diseases de∣pends upon the application of the most powerful stimuli, it necessarily follows that, they are diseas∣es of indirect debility.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="033254_0033_0ff6a79cae51aa80"/>THIS error seems to have arisen from an opi∣nion, that upon the abstraction of stimuli from (or in the the words of Brown, the application of directly debilitating powers to) a body in a state of exhaustion, the irritability would accu∣mulate; or that direct would be superinduced on indirect debility. But this opinion is evidently erroneous. If from a person labouring under plague, malagnant fever, or gangrenous sore throat, all the usual remedies are with-held, and only cold water given, no accumulation of the excitability will take place; but on the contrary, the exhaustion will rapidly proceed, to the ex∣tinction of life. If a person, previously exhaus∣ted by exposure to excessive heat, drinks large∣ly of, or plunges himself into cold water, the exhaustion will not be removed; but on the contrary, those greater degrees of it produced, constituting Tetanus, Spasms of the stomach, &amp;c. And that these are all diseases of indirect debility, the mode of cure, which consists in the application of a very high degree of stimulant power, is a suf∣ficient proof. Gout is a familiar instance in point. The state of body liable to this disease, is produc∣ed by a long continued application of food and drink, stimulant in too high a degree. Let a gouty person be exposed to cold and moisture, and a paroxysm will readily be produced. Let him suddenly refrain from his usual quantity of
<PB N="42" REF="033254_0034_0ff6a79f7a59be80" MS="y"/>
food and drink, his stomach or head will be af∣fected; and the most powerful stimuli, as Aether, Brandy, &amp;c. will be requisite to re∣lieve him.</P>
<P N="26">XXVI.—HENCE it follows that, in diseases of exhaustion, the irritability does not accumulate upon the abstraction of stimuli; but on the contrary, the state of exhaustion is, thereby, in∣creased.</P>
<P N="27">XXVII.—IT follows also that, in the production of Typhus, Intermittents, Dysentery, and such other diseases as have appeared to arise from ex∣posure to cold, moisture, &amp;c. and have therefore been ranked by Brown, among the diseases of direct debility, the body must have previously been in a state exhaustion. By a subduction of exciting powers, from a body in such a state, the previous degree of exhaustion must be in∣creased, and the diseases of that state consequent∣ly induced.</P>
<P N="28">XXVIII.—MOST of the diseases of exhaustion appear to be produced in this manner.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV. OF DISEASES DENOMINATED BY BROWN, DIEAS∣ES OF EXCESSIVE EXCITEMENT.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Lynch's Table, prefixed to Beddoes's edition of Brown's Elements of Medicine.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P N="29">XXIX.—AS there are three states of the excita∣bility, (v. 1, 2, 3) so there are three correspond∣ing states of excitement.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="43" REF="033254_0035_0ff6a7a22134cb20"/>1st.—THE state of diminished excitement, from a <HI>deficient</HI> application of stimuli, corres∣ponding with the state of accumulation, or di∣rect debility.</P>
<P N="2">2dly.—THE state of high excitement, from a <HI>due</HI> application of stimuli, corresponding with the middle state of the excitability or health.</P>
<P N="3">3dly.—THE state of diminished excitement, from an <HI>excessive</HI> application of stimuli, corres∣ponding with the state of exhaustion, or indi∣rect debility.</P>
<P N="30">XXX.—ALTHOUGH the stimulant powers may be applied, in an excessive degree, to the middle or healthy state of the excitability, it is evident that excitement never can be excessive; for eve∣ry degree of stimulant power, greater than is ne∣cessary to produce health, must occasion a de∣gree of exhaustion proportionate to the excess, (v. 3); and every degree of stimulant power, less than is necessary to produce health, must oc∣casion a degree of accumulation, proportionate to the deficiency. (v. 1.)</P>
<P N="31">XXXI.—THERE are, therefore, no diseases of excessive excitement. From whence it follows that those, which have been so denominated by Brown, must be diseases, either of direct, or indirect debelity (vi.)</P>
<P N="32"><PB N="44" REF="033254_0036_0ff6a7a4f9996450"/>XXXII.—THAT they are all diseases of indi∣rect debility, seldom constituting a very high de∣gree of exhaustion, is proved, both by the pow∣ers that are known to induce them, and the remedies that are found most successful in their cure.</P>
<P>CATARRH, pneumonia, acute rheumatism, and other diseases of this class, are occasioned by the application of a considerable degree of heat, after the body has been previously exposed to cold;—or <HI>vice versa.</HI> The temperature of warm rooms is, in general, greater than is sufficient to support healthy excitement. If the body there∣fore has been previously exposed to a considera∣ble degree of cold, the irritability must be accu∣mulated (v. 1); and the application of a high degree of heat, to a body in that state, must in∣evitably produce exhaustion.</P>
<P>IF, on the contrary, a person has been previ∣ously exposed to a degree of heat, beyond what is necessary to support healthy excitement, and cold be suddenly applied, the same effects will be produced (xxv.)—In most of these diseases, a lo∣cal affection takes place, which evidently arises, from some parts being more exposed to the exci∣ting powers, than other parts of the body;—as the mucous membrane of the nose and fauces, in
<PB N="45" REF="033254_0037_0ff6a7a9f42dbe08"/>
catarrh; the bronchioe and lungs, in pneumonia; and the extremities, in rheumatism. The mode in which the cure of these diseases is effected, viz. by warmth, small quantities of opium, wine, &amp;c. and the application of fomentations, rubefacients, and blisters to the local affection, is a proof that they are diseases of indirect debility.</P>
<P>THE langour, inability to motion, want of ap∣petite, nausea, costiveness, &amp;c. which occur in these diseases, are evidently incompatible with such a state, as that of excessive excitement. Could such a state possibly exist, the functions of the body would be invigorated, in the exact degree of the excess.</P>
<P>IN convalescence from these diseases, it is well known, that a greater degree of nutritious food, wine, and other stimuli, are necessary, than in a state of health. But if they depended upon a state of excessive excitement, the cure could not otherwise be effected, than by persevering in an abstraction of stimuli, until health was re-establish∣ed. The exhibition of stimulant powers would produce an increase of disease.</P>
<P>SMALL-POX and meazles are of this kind, and to be cured only by stimulant powers.</P>
<P>THE mode in which Brown fell into error, in
<PB N="46" REF="033254_0038_0ff6a72e4437f8a8"/>
considering some diseases as depending upon a state of excessive excitement, was probably this. Having still, (altho' contrary to one of his own fundamental principles "that all powers applied to living bodies are stimulant,"—in other words "that there is not a sedative in nature,") retained an idea, that those medicines, called evacuants, are debilitating; and having found that, under a moderate application of them, together with the other parts of the usual treatment, patients gene∣rally recovered from these diseases, he was led to conclude, that they depended upon a state of ex∣cessive excitement.</P>
<P>THE mode of action, however, of those me∣dicines, seems to have been universally misun∣derstood. As all objects, capable of producing an effect upon living bodies, are stimulant (x), those which produce evacuations must necessarily be included. If a certain quantity of calomel, in∣fusion of senna, salts, or any other cathartic medi∣cine, be taken, its immediate effect, like that of opium, camphor, or any other acknowledged stimulus, will be an increased strength of pulse, a sense of general invigoration, and all the usual symptoms of increased excitement, in proportion to its degree. And this will continue as long as the operation of the medicine. If the dose is sufficient to produce a high degree of excitement,
<PB N="47" REF="033254_0039_0ff6a7adbb88cc88"/>
a discharge of natural foeces, when these have previously been long retained, will be the conse∣quence. Is there any other mode, by which the intestines may be made to perform their functi∣ons, and to expel their contents, but by increasing their excitement? Certainly not —But if a greater quantity be given than is necessary, to en∣able the intestines to expel, with facility, their contents, a new disease is produced;—indirect debility is established; and a discharge of mucus, and sometimes of blood, accompanied by dis∣agreeable sensations, follows; symptoms which are only to be removed by opium, and other stimuli.—It is not therefore with an intention of evacuating, that those medicines should be given. In diarrhoeas, and incipient dysentery, where the intestines are evidently in a state of indirect de∣bility, calomel, castor oil, and all the other me∣dicines called cathartics, instead of increasing, invariably diminish the number of evacuations; and, by a judicious repetition of the doses, cure the disease. Those medicines, therefore, do not effect cures, by their EVACUANT, but by their STIMULANT POWERS.</P>
<P>AS opium, aether, volatile alkali, wine, &amp;c. when given in an improper manner, diminish; so the medicines, usually denominated evacuants, when given in a proper manner, increase the excitement.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER V. LOCAL DISEASES.</HEAD>
<P N="33">XXXIII.—THE principles laid down in the preceding pages, respecting diseases, which affect the whole body, equally apply to those, which effect only a part.</P>
<P N="34">XXXIV.—AS diseases, which affect the whole of the body, depend upon, either accumulation or exhaustion of the excitability (vi.); the same law must apply, with equal force, to any of its parts, separately considered.</P>
<P N="35">XXXV.—IF that proposition (vi.) be true (as it undoubtedly is) it follows, that local diseases never depend upon a state of excessive excitement. Inflammation, therefore, alocal disease of the most frequent occurence, does not, as has been gene∣rally supposed, depend on such a state; but, like the diseases of the whole body, which have been de∣nominated by Brown, diseases of excessive excite∣ment, and by others inflammatory, is, on the contra∣ry a disease of diminished excitement, from indirect debility; excepting in the single case of inflam∣mation, produced by the exposure of any particu∣lar part of the body to a high degree of cold. As this proposition is of considerable importance, it may be necessary to enlarge upon it. The symp∣toms
<PB N="49" REF="033254_0041_0ff6a7b8e7ae37e8"/>
of local inflammation are heat, pain, redness, swelling; and, in secreting surfaces, an increased secretion. It is evident that, in inflammation, an enlargement of the vessels takes place without a proportionate degree of contraction; and that an increased quantity of blood flows into them.—As the effect of stimuli, upon the muscular fibre, is to produce contraction; and as the blood is the appropriate stimulus of the arteries; it is evident that, if these were diseases of excessive excitement, an increased contraction of the vessels, or a di∣minution of their diameters, in proportion to the increased quantity of the blood, would take place. If the vigour of a muscle is ascertained, by the force of its contraction, it is clear that every increase of vigour should be attended with an in∣creased force of contraction. If local inflamma∣tion, therefore, was a disease of excessive excite∣ment, there would be a diminution, instead of an increase, of the quantity of blood, in the vessels of the part. But that there is actually an encreas∣ed quantity of blood, in the vessels of the parts inflamed, is evident in opthalmia, and those in∣flammations, which are produced, in the course of experiments, upon the transparent membranes of animals. The same idea too is farther confirm∣ed, by the mode of cure, which is universally a∣dopted, and found successful, in those diseases.
<PB N="50" REF="033254_0042_0ff6a7bc429531a0"/>
The application of blisters, and inhalation of warm steam, in pneumonia, catarrh, and inflammatory sore throat; of vinegar, and ardent spirits, in burns, and scalds; warm fomentations, and poul∣tices, in phlegmon; solution of volatile alkali, tincture of cantharides, and the different prepara∣tions of camphor, in the inflammation of the joints, in acute rheumatism; tincture of opium, and solutions of corrosive sublimate in opthalmia; —are all so many proofs of the truth of this pro∣position.</P>
<P N="36">XXXVI.—IN catarrh, pneumonia, acute rheu∣matism, phrenitis, and those other diseases of in∣direct debility, which have been called diseases of excessive excitement, the local affection, which arises from the parts being more exposed to the action of the exciting powers, differs from the general, only in being greater in degree.</P>
<P N="37">XXXVII.—IN local, therefore, as well as ge∣neral disease, the causes which produce, and the powers which cure them, tend equally to prove, that a state of excessive excitement can∣not possibly take place, either in the whole, or any part of the body; and that the diseases usually considered as dependent upon such a state, are almost, without exception, diseases of indirect debility.</P>
<P N="38"><PB N="51" REF="033254_0043_0ff6a7be1c7a63d8"/>XXXVIII.—LOCAL diseases, like those of the whole body, are to be cured by an application of stimulant powers, in a degree proportioned to the state of the excitability.</P>

<HEAD>☞ <HI>EXPLANATION</HI> of the <HI>TABLE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS Table is meant merely to convey a general idea of the manner, in which stimuli should be increased, or diminish∣ed, in proportion to the exhaustion, or accumulation of the excitability. It is not supposed, that the degree of the excitability, or the proportion of stimulus represented by the figures in the table, can be ascertained in any other man∣ner, than by observation of the effects produced by their ap∣plication. The range of figures, is by no means sufficient to express the various degrees of accumulation and exhausti∣on of the excitability, that can take place, between the middle state and death. It will however, be sufficient to give a general idea of the mode of cure, deducible from the principles laid down in the preceding pages.</P>

<HEAD>CASE I.</HEAD>
<P>FRANCIS LOTE, aged 35, was admitted into the General Hospital, at Calcutta, on the 1st of May, 1796.—At that time, he complained of general pains over his body, with all those symptoms which indicate an exhausted constitu∣tion. On the 15th of May, he came under my care. At that time I found his mouth sore, from the use of Mercury; and he was much purged and griped. On the 3d of June, when I discontinued attending him, his complaints were considerably relieved, by the use of Opium. On the 21st of August, he again came under my care, in a state of extreme debility, with ex∣cessive purging, and bloody stools. Du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing the whole of this time, he had remained in the Hos∣pital; but, from necessary arrangements, had fallen, during intervals, under the care of other
<PB N="55" REF="033254_0047_0ff6a7306d31fdf8"/>
gentlemen. During the last of these intervals, he was so extremely weak that, in the act of vo∣miting, the right clavicle was fractured, which occasioned much pain. On that and the two successive days, I gave him eighty drops of Tinc∣ture of Opium, morning, and evening. On the 24th, in the morning, as no effect seemed to be produced by the medicine, it was ordered to be given three times a day. At one o'clock P. M. the same day, I was called to him; and found him complaining of violent pain in the bowels, with incessant purging. He had taken the 2d draught about an hour before. The draught was ordered to be immediately repeated. At 9 P. M. he was not relieved; upon which 150 drops of Tincture of Opium was prescribed immediately and ordered to be repeated at 12 o'clock. A glyster, with 200 drops of Tincture of Opium was also given. On the 25th he was easier. The glysters, with 200 drops of Tincture of Opium, were continued every three hours, and the draught, with 150 drops, was repeated in the evening. On the 26th, in the morning, he was nearly in the same state; the glysters were continued, and the draughts ordered 3 times in the day. At 9 P. M. I found that the relief from the glysters, was merely temporary, that he had stools every hour, and no inclination to sleep. Four hundred drops of Tincture of Opium were
<PB N="56" REF="033254_0048_0ff6a7cb6630cb60"/>
ordered in glyster, every two hours, and a fourth draught of 200 drops to be taken at 12 o'clock. On the 26th he was easier; he had six or seven stools in the night, with less griping. Slept better than he had done, since he came to the Hos∣pital. His pulse beat about 90 strokes in the minute; previous to this his pulse had been very quick and small, but the state of it was not particularly noted; he had 150 drops of Tinc∣ture of Opium in the morning, and 200 at 12 o'clock. Four hundred drops were ordered in glyster, every three hours. One P. M. He had 5 stools since morning; the glysters were continued; and a draught of 200 drops or∣dered to be taken at 4 o'clock. At 8 P. M. he had 13 stools since the last visit, with a good deal of pain in his bowels. He had not slept; was ordered a draught of four hundred drops of Tincture of Opium at ten o'clock. August the 28th, he had slept a little the preceding night; bowels were easier; pulse 80; had draughts of 200 drops every two hours, with the glysters occasionally. At 2 P. M. his pulse was 90; he was in other respects as before: had ta∣ken three draughts. The draughts of 200 drops were repeated every hour. At 9 P. M. his pulse was still 90; he had dosed much, but had no sound sleep; he had taken 4 draughts. A draught of 400 drops was ordered to be given
<PB N="57" REF="033254_0049_0ff6a7cdf4f79db8"/>
at 12 o'clock. On the 29th, his pulse was 80, and strong; he had 3 stools, with less pain; but slept little; the draughts of 200 drops were continued every hour.—2 P. M. had incessant stools since morning, with violent pain of the bowels; glysters of 400 drops were ordered eve∣ry hour. 8 P. M. had four stools since 2 o'clock; had taken only one draught; his bowels were easy after the glysters; pulse 112.—Eight draughts, with 200 drops each, were ordered to be placed at his bed-side, of which he was direct∣ed to take one every hour, during the night, with glysters of 500 drops every hour, in the intervals between the draughts.—30th, had six stools during the night. He was free from pain, and his pulse 80 and full; the draughts were continued every two hours, and the glysters occasionally. 9 o'clock P. M. he had eight or ten stools since morning, with some griping; pulse 90. The draughts were increased to 300 drops every two hours; and the glysters continued.—31st, had passed a good night; his pulse was 90; he had five stools; his medicines were continued as the day before. In the evening, he was nearly the same; no alteration was made in his medi∣cines—September the 1st, he had six stools during the night, with griping: did not sleep; had no blood in his stools; for two days; the draughts of three hundred drops were given every hour, and the glysters of five hundred drops were conti∣nued
<PB N="58" REF="033254_0050_0ff6a7d2baa79448"/>
as before, and repeated according to his own discretion, as the tenesmus and griping might in∣dicate.—8 P. M. he was much worse; had eight stools during the day, and no sleep; his pulse was 120, and he was so extremely weak, that I con∣sidered him as approaching to dissolution. Draughts of 500 drops each, were ordered to be given every hour, and the glysters of 500 drops; to be continued as before.—2d, he had not slept, but felt himself better; pulse 104; his medicines were continued, in the same manner during the whole of that day. On the 3d, his pulse was 100; he had slept well the preceding night; his medicines were continued. On the 4th, he was much better, had dosed much, and had only two stools; the draughts were directed to be taken occasionally, as circumstances might indicate—This plan was continued until the 14th, at which time his mouth became sore, and the flow of saliva was increased, as if he had been using mercury. The draughts and glysters were, from that period, ordered to be repeated occasi∣onally, according to his own discretion. On the 22d, the discharge of saliva continued in the same state.—On the 26th, he was better; and his bow∣els easy.— 29th, he continued without pain, with two or three stools in the day, and his strength increasing. On the 30th, when I discontinued attending him, he had only two stools in the
<PB N="59" REF="033254_0051_0ff6a7d59ce8a280"/>
day, without pain; and felt a returning appetite. Being a sensible and steady man, he was, at that time, allowed to proportion the strength and frequency of the draughts and glysters according to his own judgment.—During the whole of the time that he was under my care, he had an al∣lowance of wine from one to two or three bot∣tles in the 24 hours, according to exigency.— From his good sense and punctuality, I have a perfect reliance upon his having conformed to my orders, in every particular, as far as it is possible for patients, in an hospital, to do.</P>
<P>THE treatment of this case may give some idea of the manner in which stimuli should be increased, in diseases of great exhaustion, until the quantity is ascertained, which is capable of producing the highest degree of excitement. It will shew the very great quantity of the most powerful stimuli that may be necessary, in some diseases of that state, in order to effect a cure; and is also an example of the mode in which the doses ought to be repeated. The soreness of the mouth, and the increased flow of saliva, evince that there is a greater similitude between the action of opium and mercury, than has yet been acknowledged. The soreness of the mouth and spitting commenced, after the quan∣tity of opium was diminished. Upon resum∣ing the draughts, the mouth became less sore,
<PB N="60" REF="033254_0052_0ff6a7384ef68d18"/>
and the flow of salava decreased; and upon leaving them off, the soreness and spitting in∣creased. This was repeatedly remarked by the patient himself. It should be observed, in or∣der to prevent a rash imitation, where the cir∣cumstances are not alike, that the tincture of opium employed; upon this occasion, was much weaker than what is usually made in Europe; that a very great degree of exhaustion had taken place; and that the doses were gradually increased, from eight drops to five hundred.</P>

<HEAD>CASE II.</HEAD>
<P>—DE HAES, aged 40, was admitted into the General Hospital, at Calcutta, on the evening of the 26th of August, 1796, with dysentery of eight days standing. He had about 30 stools in the day, containing slime, mixed with blood; and complained of much pain in his bowels. His pulse was 90 in the minute. At 9 o'clock P. M. he was ordered to rub in, half an ounce of Mercurial Ointment, with half a drachm of Calomel, and to take a hundred drops of Tinc∣ture of Opium, to be repeated at 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> o'clock—27th, the Ointment was omitted by neglect. He continued in the same state. Half an ounce
<PB N="61" REF="033254_0053_0ff6a7d788746208"/>
of Mercurial Ointment, with a drachm of Ca∣lomel, was ordered to be rubbed in immediately, and repeated at 12 o'clock. A hundred drops of Tincture of Opium was desired to be given every two hours.—1 o'clock P. M. he had ten stools since morning, with blood and slime. Had taken only two draughts. The Ointment was ordered to be repeated at 4 o'clock, a glys∣ter with two hundred drops of tincture of opi∣um to be given every two hours, and one bot∣tle of wine to be taken in the course of the evening—8 P. M. pulse 100. He had six stools with less pain. The ointment was rubbed in, and glysters were regularly administered. The ointment was ordered to be again repeated at 9 o'clock, the glysters to be continued, a draught of a hundred and fifty drops of tincture of opium to be given immediately, and to be re∣peated at 12 o'clock; and a bottle of Madeira to be given during the night.—28th, he had vo∣mited several times during the night, but had only one stool; pulse 75. The ointment was ordered to be repeated, the glysters to be omit∣ted, a draught with one hundred drops of tinc∣ture of opium to be given, and the wine to be continued.—2 P. M. pulse 72; vomited twice since morning; he had only two stools, and the pain was less; he slept a little. The ointment, draught, and wine were repeated.—9 P. M. pulse
<PB N="62" REF="033254_0054_0ff6a73b96c043b8"/>
84, had vomited twice, and had six stools. He complained of virtigo; the ointment was repeated, a draught of two hundred drops of tincture of opium was ordered to be given at 12 o'clock, and the wine to be continued.—29th, his pulse was 80 and full. He had ten stools, consisting of slime and blood. The ointment and wine were continued, and a draught, with one hun∣dred drops of tincture of opium, ordered every two hours—9 P. M. his pulse was 80, he had six stools, and frequent vomitting, particularly after taking the Maderia wine. The ointment was repeated, two hundred drops of tincture of opium ordered every two hours, and port wine to be given in lieu of the Madeira.—30th, pulse 74. He had two stools, vomited only once, and slept a little. The ointment and wine were repeated, and the draughts with two hundred drops, continued every third hour.—9 P. M. he had several stools in the course of the day, with much pain. No return of vomiting; pulse 100. The ointment was repeated with two drachms of calomel. Draughts of two hundred drops each, were ordered to be continued every two hours. The port wine became disagreeabie to him, and Medeira was again given—31st, pulse 84; had only two stools, and slept well. His mouth was a little sore. The ointment was repeated with one drachm of calomel, and the draughts
<PB N="63" REF="033254_0055_0ff6a7da27329f48"/>
were continued every third hour.—9 P. M. pulse 80, he had eight stools. His skin and tongue were moist, and he began to spit a little. He had slept some during the day. The oint∣ment, draughts, and wine were continued. September the 1st, pulse 76, he had only one stool, slept well, and was better in every respect. The ointment was repeated, with half a drachm of calomel; and the draughts and wine were continued.—8 P. M. continued better. He had no pains, excepting in going to stool. The dis∣charge of salava was considerable. He had slept during the day. The ointment was omitted. A draught of two hundred drops of tincture of opium was ordered at 12 o'clock; and the wine was continued.—2d, he had only one stool during the night; pulse 68; the ointment was repeated without the calomel; and the wine continued—8 P. M. he had slept during the day, and spit considerably; the draught of two hun∣dred drops was repeated at 12 o'clock, and the wine continued.—3d, he had slept well, and had no stool; the ointment as entirely omitted; and the evening draught and wine were conti∣nued.—From that period the wine, and draughts occasionally, were continued until the 30th of September, at which time I left him in an ad∣vanced state of convalescence.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="033254_0056_0ff6a83842182db8"/>THE great quantity of mercury that was used, in this case, in conjunction with opium and wine, shew what a high degree of stimulant power may sometimes be required to effect a cure, in the state of exhaustion, which consti∣tutes dysentery.</P>

<HEAD>CASE III.</HEAD>
<P>JACOB MEYER, aged 35, was admitted into the General Hospital, at Calcutta, on the 23d of August, 1796, with pain of bowels and frequent stools. These complaints appeared at first to be slight; and seemed for sometime, to give way to ordinary doses of calomel and opi∣um. On the 29th he became worse; and the same treatment was persevered in, but without effect. On the 1st of September, calomel and opium, of each two grains, every second hour, and a draught of eighty drops of tincture of opium, twice a day, were prescribed. The symptoms still increased in force. On the 3d, he had very frequent stools with violent pain in the bowels; and could not bear the least pres∣sure on the caput coli. His pulse was 132, thirst extreme, tongue furred; and he had no sleep. Half an ounce of mercurial ointment,
<PB N="65" REF="033254_0057_0ff6a8120e837440"/>
and one drachm of calomel were rubbed in. The calomel and opium were given every hour. On the 4th his pulse was 120, he had vomited through the night, tongue brown and furred. The ointment was rubbed in, and to be repeat∣ed at 12 o'clock; the pills of calomel and opium were continued.—9 P. M. pulse 130; he had several stools during the day; tongue dry; he thought that he spit more than usual, but his mouth did not seem affected; one ounce of ointment and two drachms of calomel were rubbed in, and the pills were continued.—On the 5th his pulse was 120, he complained of violent pain in his bowels; the medicines were continued as the day before.—6th, his pulse was 100; he complained of violent pain on pressing the arch of the colon, had frequent stools with profuse perspiration, and appeared to be much alarmed and dejected; no increase of the quan∣tity of saliva; the ointment and pills were con∣tinued in the same manner.—7 P. M. his pulse was 124; in other respects as before; he was immersed in the warm bath, and afterwards had one ounce of ointment, with half an ounce of calomel rubbed in; the pills were continued. —7th, pulse 112; complaints were nearly as the day before. He had an eruption upon the skin, such as usually appears, when salivation cannot be produced, after having used a large quantity
<PB N="66" REF="033254_0058_0ff66b67241da6b8"/>
of mercury. The warm bath, with the oint∣ment and calomel, were repeated; and the ca∣lomel in the pills was increased to four grains.— 8 P. M. pulse 128, he had incessant stools, accompanied by violent pains of the abdomen; his tongue was brown and furred, and skin co∣vered with profuse moisture. The bath was ordered to be repeated, and an ounce of oint∣ment, with two ounces of calomel, to be rubbed in, immediately after the bath. A scruple of colomel and six grains of opium were ordered to be given every second hour—8th, pulse 112; he had incessant stools, with violent pain. He felt ease from the warm bath; had taken five doses of the calomel and opium. The warm bath was ordered to be repeated three times in the day, the ointment and calomel to be again rub∣bed in, and the pills to be continued.—8 P. M. pulse 120, there was no increase in the quantity of saliva from the mercury, he had incessant stools with blood, and was extremely debilitated. Had taken six doses of the calomel and opium in the course of the day. Could not bear the least pressure upon the colon. The warm bath was ordered to be repeated, and afterwards two ounces of ointment, with four ounces of calomel, to be rubbed in. The calomel and opium to be given every hour—9th, pulse 112 and small. He had stools innumerable. The medicines were
<PB N="67" REF="033254_0059_0ff6a8187b3eea78"/>
continued. 9 P. M. his pulse was almost im∣perceptible, and extremities cold. The medi∣cines were continued as far as circumstances would admit. 10th at 1 o'clock, A. M. he ex∣pired.</P>
<P>THE body of this patient was either not op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦ed, or the appearances upon dissection were neglected to be noted down, at the time; and were consequently forgotten. But from the analogy between this case and all the others, in which the mouth could not be affected, in the usual manner, by mercury, there can scarcely be a doubt that the colon and rectum, if not the whole of the abdominal viscera were in a state of local disease. The cases of dissection, des∣cribed by Mr. Maclean, will explain this point more fully. Of many cases of dysentery, and other diseases, that were opened by us, in which salivation could not be produced by mercury, there was not one without confirmed local disease of the viscera, either of the thorax or abdomen, or both.</P>
<P>THOSE, who may look upon the quantity of medicine here prescribed as extraordinary, should consider, that when a patient is evidently in∣curable, by the common practice, it becomes the duty of the practitioner to depart from it.
<PB N="68" REF="033254_0060_0ff6a81f6af07650"/>
An opposite conduct is dictated, much more by a sly regard to reputation, than an earnest and conscientious desire of saving the lives of patients. Nothing can be more easy than to take shelter under customary forms.</P>

<P>IN the above case, the medicines were regu∣larly given, either by a friend of the patient's, who took a particular interest in his welfare, by Mr. RIDGES, then surgeon's mate of the Nor∣thumberland, or by myself.—The relapses which always took place, upon suddenly laying the me∣dicines aside, or with-holding them even for a night, shew the necessity of repeating the doses, with the utmost regularity and care. The sore∣ness of the mouth, together with the increased flow of saliva, after the use of opium, was not a peculiar circumstance. Upon that subject, the following remark appears in my Journal:—
<Q>In many cases, in which opium was freely giv∣en, for a length of time, a considerable in∣crease in the flow of saliva, was observed to take place, and to continue long after the me∣dicine was laid aside. But in cases, where a considerable spitting had before existed, opium as well as mercury had the effect of lessening it.</Q>
These facts, with the explanation of them, will be considered in another place.</P>

<P>ENSIGN G—, 36th regiment, a stout healthy man, about 25 years of age, went up, in a fit of playfulness, to the main-top-mast-head, on the evening of the 10th of June, 1791. Af∣ter having remained there a short time, he fell asleep upon the cross-trees, and about mid-night fell down upon the quarter-deck. In the fall, he first struck with his hip, as was supposed, against an iron stauncheon in the main-top, which bent; he then came upon the mizzen-stay, which took him, as far as could be collected from the confus∣ed intelligence of some people upon deck, about the middle of the abdomen; and from the stay he fell upon the quarter-deck. He was, as may well be supposed, entirely insensible; much blood was discharged from his mouth, nose, ears, and even from his eyes; in this state he was carried down to his cabbin; upon examina∣tion, no fracture was found; the whole conse∣quences of the fall seemed to consist of contusi∣ons or concussion, the marks of which were very

general over his body. His pulse was small, but regular. There happened to be in the ship four professional gentlemen, besides myself. They all seemed of opinion, that Mr. G. should imme∣diately lose blood. Some of them insisted upon it, with much earnestness; and the by-standers, knowing that to be the common practice, joined in urging a compliance. I replied, that, how∣ever common the practice might be, I was con∣vinced of its being entirely wrong; and that I would not, even with the sanction of a majority, do what I was certain must endanger the life of my patient. But that if any of the gentlemen present, chose to take charge of Mr.—G, they might have an opportunity of bleeding him, with propriety, if convinced in their conscience that it was right; and I would give them my opinion when asked. This offer was not accepted. Mr. G. was not bled. In the course of two hours from the accident, he became sensible; was sick at stomach, and vomited. This, as a symptom of concussion usually enumerated, would far∣ther indicate, according to the hypotheses of the schools, and the practice of hospitals, copious blood-letting. That, however, did not alter my plan. I was aware indeed that, if the pati∣ent died, his death would be attributed to the non-observance of customary forms. But I was
<PB N="76" REF="033254_0068_0ff6a833ebc77d30"/>
also persuaded that, if he lived, after having been copiously bled, it would be in spite of the blood-letting. He was my friend, as well as my patient; and in defiance of obloquy, I deter∣mined to do what appeared to me best, in order to save his life. Externally the most powerful stimulating substances were applied, in concourse or succession. For four days he could not move in bed, without excruciating pain. He had small opiates occasionally, wine, and nourishing food; and once half an ounce of sal catharticus amarus, so as to produce one stool. Nothing more was done. He had not an unfavourable symptom. The pains gradually abated; and on the eighth day, from the fall, he was carried upon deck in a chair.</P>
<P>THAT there was absolutely a considerable de∣gree of concussion in this case appears, from his having wholly lost the sight of one eye, although, when the marks of contusion had disappeared from that side of his face, the eye looked almost as well as the other. He complained at times of headach, which was always relieved by wrapping up his head in warm cloths.</P>
<P>THE issue of this, as well as of every other case of contusion or concussion, which I have seen treated, either in or out of hospitals, convinced
<PB N="77" REF="033254_0069_0ff6a835d7bc89c0"/>
me, that blood-letting is not only unnecessary but pernicious. In private practice, I fear, a mean and criminal compliance with vulgar prejudice, in order to conciliate vulgar favour, too often influences practitioners, whose better judgments would lead them to reject intirely so deplorable a remedy:—a remedy of which the use is not only contrary to all principle; but which, so far as I know, cannot adduce a single uncontrovert∣ible fact, in proof of its utility.</P>

<HEAD>CASE VI.</HEAD>
<P>WILLIAM HOLLOWAY, aged 22, was admitted into the General Hospital, at Calcutta, on the 3d of September, 1796, with symptoms of typhus fever, of several days standing. At bed time, he took two grains of opium, and six grains of calomel.—4th, he had slept a little; his tongue was parched and black; pulse 96, he had two stools on the 3d. Six grains of calomel, and six grains of powder of jallap, were ordered to be given every four hours.—5th, in addition to his former symptoms, he complained of cough and pain of breast. He had only one stool, since he began to take the powders. The powders.
<PB N="78" REF="033254_0070_0ff6a7fcd5da5c40"/>
were ordered to be repeated, and a draught, with sixty drops of tincture of opium to be given at bed time.—9 o'clock, P. M. he had not yet taken the draught prescribed for him in the morning; the pain of his breast was more severe; he had no stool for twenty-four hours; was ordered a glyster with one ounce of castor oil, and one ounce of Glauber's salts; and afterwards to take the draught.—6th, he had no stool from the glyst∣er. His pulse was 116; his tongue furred and black, and his mouth exceedingly parched; he was a little confused, and had a slight degree of subsultus tendinum. Two ounces of the common infusion of senna was ordered every hour, and a glyster, double the strength of the former, every second hour until he should have a stool or two.— 7 o'clock P. M. he had one copious stool, after having taken several doses of the infusion, and two or three glysters. Four grains of opium and four grains of calomel were ordered to be taken at 8 o'clock, and to be repeated at 12— On the 7th, he conceived himself better; pulse 108; his tongue was still furred and skin hot. He was allowed twelve glasses of wine in the day. Ten grains of calomel, and fifteen grains of powder of jallap, were prescribed every four hours.—9 o'clock, P. M. his skin was very hot, pulse only 100; he had taken three of the pow∣ders,
<PB N="79" REF="033254_0071_0ff6a83e9ea9cec8"/>
and had 3 stools; he complained that his tongue was sore. It was still furred and black in the middle. He was ordered a draught, with a hundred drops of tincture of opium, at 8 o'clock, and again at twelve.—8th, his pulse was 100, and heat of skin more moderate; but his tongue remained foul; he expressed a wish for porter.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The desire for beer or porter, is a symptom that frequently occurs, when the mouth begins to be affected, after having used mercury.</NOTE> A bottle of porter was allowed him; —and the wine was continued. The powders and draughts were repeated.—9th, he remained nearly in the same state; but complained of a severe cough. He had two stools. All his me∣dicines were continued as the day before.—10th, he had no cough, and rested well; his pulse was 112; he had no stool; two ounces of infusion of senna were ordered to be taken every hour through the day, and the draughts to be repeated at night.—11th, his pulse was 116, tongue very foul, and mouth parched; he had slept but lit∣tle; and had no stool since the 9th.—A glyster, with two ounces of castor oil, and two ounces of Glauber's salts, was ordered to be given imme∣diately, and to be repeated according to circum∣stances. The powders were given as before.— 7 o'clock, P. M. his pulse was only 100; tongue
<PB N="80" REF="033254_0072_0ff6a842f7209068"/>
cleaner, and moist.—He had one stool after hav∣ing taken two glysters. He remarked that he had, for the first time, a distinct paroxysm of fever in the afternoon. The draughts were given as usual.—12th, his pulse was 92, and his skin nearly of a healthy temperature; his tongue remained a little furred; he had no stool. The glysters, powders, and draughts, were directed to be given in the same manner as the day before.— 13th, when I visited him, he was sound asleep, seemed easy, and his skin cool. The medicines were ordered to be continued.—7 o'clock P. M. his pulse was 76; skin moist and cool; he had two stools, and was inclined to sleep. The draughts were continued.—14th, he was not so well as the day before; his pulse was 96 in the morning, and 92 in the evening, and his tongue rather foul. The medicines were continued. On the 15th, his skin, tongue, and pulse, ap∣proached nearly to the healthy standard. He expressed a desire to eat, and was ordered to have chicken broth. The powders and draughts were continued. On the 16th, he had no fe∣verish symptom, his tongue was sore at the edges, and there was an increased flow of saliva. The powders were omitted, and the draughts conti∣ed. From that period, he was convalescent, and only took one draught occasionally at night. On
<PB N="81" REF="033254_0073_0ff6a8458cc0c540"/>
the 23d, he was free from complaint, and dis∣charged from the Hospital.—During the whole of the time, he was allowed wine and porter, as at first prescribed.</P>
<P>THIS case is not given as an uncommon one, either in respect to the violence of the disease, or the quantity of medicines that were prescrib∣ed. The history of it shews, that the sum of sti∣mulant power first applied, was inadequate to effect a cure, even in a case of slight disease; for the symptoms by no means approached to the severity of typhus gravior. In every fever, what∣ever be its nosological description, the same plan would have been pursued, increasing or dimi∣nishing the force of the exciting powers, in pro∣portion to the degree of indirect debility. If such a quantity, as was used here, be necessary for the cure of mild typhus, what powerful sti∣muli must often be required in typhus gravior, dy∣sentery, or plague?</P>
<P>THE intervals, I think, at which the medicines were repeated, are too long. The duration of the action of each dose of mercury or jallap is not, perhaps near so much as four hours—pro∣bably not more than one. But whatever it be, such is the period exactly, at which doses ought to be repeated.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="033254_0074_0ff6a847d1caee80"/>IN this, as well as in many cases, both of dy∣sentery and fever, I have given castor oil, jallap, and other cathartics, with a view simply to in∣crease the excitement. In so far as they effect that, and thereby invigorate the functions of life, they are proportionally as useful as opium, aether, mercury, brandy, wine, or bark. But the purging I conceive to be proportionally as in∣jurious a consequence, and as much a mark of in∣direct debility, as the headach, sickness, and vom∣iting, which follow an excessive or irregular use of these substances. This subject is considered at greater length elsewhere.</P>

<HEAD>CASE VII.</HEAD>
<P>JOHN BROWN, aged 28, was admitted in∣to the General Hospital, at Calcutta, on the 10th of July, 1796, with typhus fever—He had besides a sore leg, and chancres. His fever, although apparently slight, was very obstinate. In the course of two months, he was several times almost cured, by small and frequently repeated quantities of opium, mercury, wine, and bark, varied accor∣ding to circumstances. But, seemingly in conse∣quence of internal local affection, he as often re∣lapsed, without any apparent cause. His fever,
<PB N="83" REF="033254_0075_0ff6a84a05559da8"/>
from continued became remittent, and from re∣mittent intermittent. On the 24th of September, suspecting the existence of local disease, I repre∣sented to him the necessity of undergoing such a course of mercury as to affect his mouth, to which he had hitherto expressed an insuperable aversion. He had, for some days previously, taken calomel in small doses; and had latterly two emetics, at his own request.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That tartar emetic is a stimulant of very high power is evident, from the small quantity of it, which produces the state of indirect debility, that occasions vomiting. It should be given in such a manner, as to increase and to support the excitement. But this will be found difficult, as the duration of its action seems to be even shorter than that of opium. If its action does not continue more than a quarter of an hour, might it not be repeated at such short intervals, and the doses so gradually reduced, as not to allow the establishment of in∣direct debility? If, when given at such a random rate, as to produce vomiting, and the most disagreeable sensations that can be imagined, medicines sometimes produce good effects, how much more useful must they be, when given according to just principles? The prejudices of patients may sometimes be turned to their advantage, by judiciously alternating stimuli, so as to humour their whims. The medical prejudices of the vulgar, are generally dictated by those of physicians. At pre∣sent they are as unreasonably in favour of tartar emetic, as they are against opium.</NOTE> On that day, he was ordered to take ten grains of calomel, and fifteen grains of jallap every four hours.—25th, he had taken three powders in the course of the day, and was exces∣sively
<PB N="84" REF="033254_0076_0ff6a850b93f9fd8"/>
purged and griped through the night<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This is one of many facts that prove purging to be the effect of a state of indirect debility, occasioned by the impro∣per subduction of stimulant powers. Had the powders been regularly repeated in the night, the purging and griping would not have taken place. This I have observed so repeatedly with respect to calomel, that I have no hesitation in asserting it to be an undoubted fact.</NOTE>. He had no fever. Two grains of opium, and four grains of calomel were directed to be taken every three hours, through the day, and four grains of each at bed time.—26th, the same plan was con∣tinued; and he had no return of fever.—27th, he had no fever, and his mouth was very sore. The pills were ordered to be given every six hours.— 28th, his head, face, tongue and throat, were much swelled; he had a considerable discharge of blood from the mouth and fauces, and some purging. In this case, the medicines were by no means cor∣rectly exhibited. But it is probable also, that they were not regularly taken. Salivation, or, in cases of local disease, where salivation cannot be produced, a discharge of blood from the mouth and fauces, does not take place, while the mercu∣ry is regularly taken, but when it is either sudden∣ly laid aside, or given at improper intervals.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide the subsequent cases, and the "Treatise on Mercu∣ry."</NOTE> The
<PB N="85" REF="033254_0077_0ff6a85686ddcc18"/>
following mixture was prescribed—tincture of o∣pium three hundred drops—water one pint—pep∣permint-water and sugar, as much as will make the mixture agreeable—an ounce of it to be taken every hour. The pills were omitted. On the 29th and 30th, he continued the mixture; his mouth was better; he had no fever, and but little purging; and his pulse was 86.—October the 1st, his pulse was 76, and of good strength; his mouth was much better; and he had no return of fever. The tincture of opium was diminished to two hun∣dred drops.—From that period, he recovered strength, and had no return of fever. The mix∣ture was gradually decreased in strength and dis∣continued. On the 16th of October, he was dis∣charged, apparently well.</P>
<P>THERE are several inferences to be drawn from this case. The obstinacy of the fever convinced me, that it depended upon local disease, and de∣termined me to give mercury in large doses. The discharge of blood from the mouth and fauces, without a previous increased flow of saliva, was an additional proof of the existence of internal local affection. And, altho' this patient left the Hos∣pital apparently well, I am convinced, from the circumstances mentioned, as well as from an ir∣regularity of his bowels, that his abdominal vis∣cera were in a diseased state, and that his exemp∣tion
<PB N="86" REF="033254_0078_0ff6a8589299cb88"/>
from general disease was merely temporary. From these observations, I would not be under∣stood to infer, that mercury acts as a <HI>specific</HI> in re∣moving local disease; but that, by supporting the exeitement of the whole body, it invigorates each particular part, and thus occasions, to a certain extent, the regeneration of those organs, which may have been injured by disease.</P>
<P>THIS is not the only instance, in which the good effects of opium have been experienced, where an excessive salivation, or a discharge of blood from the fauces, after the use of mercury, had taken place. As these symptoms happen from too sudden a subduction, or an irregular re∣petition of the mercury; so they may be either obviated or removed, by a proper application of the same power. But as the prejudices of pa∣tients will seldom admit of a continuance of the medicine, in these cases, it is absolutely neces∣sary to substitute some other stimulant power, equiv∣alent in force. Those which I have found to an∣swer best, are opium blisters, and the warm bath. Other stimuli, justly proportioned, might no doubt answer equally well. But from the end∣less hypotheses of the art, no successful attempts have yet been made to ascertain their relative powers. This is a discovery, which, however distant, I am yet sanguine enough to expect.

<P>HENRY DOLLAWAL, aged 26, was admitted into the General Hospital, on the even∣ing of the 22d of October, 1796. He had, for a fortnight before, complained of headach, pain of loins, hoarseness, and cough, &amp;c. pulse 58. He was ordered to take two grains of opium and four grains of calomel, at 9 o'clock, P. M. and again at twelve.—on the 23d, he was somewhat easier. Pulse as before. He had no stool. One grain of opium and three grains of calomel, were given every three hours; and several glysters of castor oil.—9 o'clock P. M. he had one stool. The opium and calomel were desired to be re∣peated as the night before. Pulse 64.—24th, he thought himself better; but his cough continued severe. Pulse 56. He was desired to take four grains of colomel every three hours.—9 o'clock P. M. he was not sensible that the pills produced any effect. Four grains of opium and ten grains of calomel were ordered to be taken immediate∣ly,
<PB N="88" REF="033254_0080_0ff6a86551678d18"/>
and repeated at 12 o'clock.—25th, he was seized in the morning with violent spasms. Pulse 64. He was put into the warm bath, which was ordered to be repeated according to circumstan∣ces. Afterwards, two grains of opium and four grains of calomel were directed to be taken eve∣ry two hours, day and night.—26th, he was much better, and had no cough. The pills were continued.—27th, he thought himself better. His pulse beat only 44 strokes in the minute. The pills were repeated every three hours.— 28th, his mouth was gently affected. Two grains of opium and two grains of calomel were given every three hours.—29th, he was in every respect better, had some slight spitting, and felt a returning appetite. Pulse 68.—One grain of opium and one grain of calomel were given eve∣ry four hours.—On the 30th, he was discharged well.</P>
<P>AN uncommonly flushed countenance, and what is called a plethoric habit, together with an unusual slowness of pulse, hoarseness, cough, and pains, would have indicated, according to the common practice, blood-letting and other evacu∣ations, in this case. The powers, however, by which a cure was effected, proved, that these symp∣toms depended upon a state of indirect debili∣ty; and that the use of debilitating powers, would have been improper. For the same rea∣son,
<PB N="89" REF="033254_0081_0ff6a816031805d0"/>
it may be inferred, that a peculiar slowness, as well as a quickness of the pulse, sometimes takes place in a state of indirect debility. Every departure of the pulse from the healthy standard, whether in quickness or slowness, depends upon debility; as well as every deviation from health, in any of the other functions. Costiveness, as well as purging, depends upon debility of the in∣testinal canal. This is shewn from patients affect∣ed with the same disease having, in some cases a quickness, in others, a slowness of pulse; in some cases purging, in others costiveness; and all of them being cured by the same means. It is farther corroborated by the proof, that such a state as that of excessive excitement, cannot take place. As blood-letting is the abstraction of a high stimulant power, it must be shewn that diseases of evcessive excitement exist, before it can be admitted as a remedy. Or if it be con∣tended that blood-letting is useful in diseases of debility, it must be shewn that it acts as a stimu∣lant power. Mere assertions that it has been found useful, do not amount to a sufficient refuta∣tion of this reasoning.</P>
<P>THERE was an error of some importance in the treatment of this case, which affords the most convincing proof of the necessity of repeating the doses of medicines, at certain regular inter∣vals, and by a certain rule.—On the morning of the 25th,—after having taken four grains of
<PB N="90" REF="033254_0082_0ff6a868736d3110"/>
opium and ten grains of calomel, at nine and at twelve o'clock, the preceding night, the pati∣ent was seized with violent griping and spasms. This symptom, as I have had frequent opportu∣nities of observing, was undoubtedly owing to the doses not having been repeated at proper inter∣vals. If a dose of equal strength, or one somewhat smaller, had been given at three, and another still smaller, at six o'clock in the morn∣ing, the state of indirect debility, constituting spasm, would not have taken place. As these symptoms may be occasioned, or prevented, at pleasure, the fact is incontrovertible. In this case, they immediately yielded to the stimulant power of the warm bath,—another proof that they arose from a state of indirect debility, oc∣casioned by a deficient frequency or force, in the application of stimulant powers. Opium, calo∣mel, camphor, aether, or castor oil, given in just proportions, would have produced the same effect with the warm bath. But external appli∣cations may often, with great advantage and con∣veniency, be alternated, or conjoined, with in∣ternal remedies.</P>

He reported that he was attacked with fever, seven or eight days before, which had become more severe and continued for the last two days. Some medicines had been taken before he came into the Hospital.—At 3 o'clock P. M. when I first saw him, ten grains of calomel were order∣ed to be taken every three hours. At 10 P.

He had one stool<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In this case the medicine seemed to produce but a very small effect. If to supply the waste of the excitability be the proper function of the lungs, it is evident that, after a cer∣tain degree of organic lesion has taken place, it cannot be re∣cruited. But stimuli are not therefore to be with-held. For, by such a treatment, the excitability must be still farther exhaust∣ed.</NOTE>; his breathing was laborious, his eyes

<P>UPON dissection, the thoracic viscera were found adhering to each other, in such a manner as to form but one mass. The lungs adhered to the pleurae, mediastinum, and diaphragm; the heart to the pericardium; and the pericardium to all the surrounding parts. The adhesions were remarkably strong as well as general. The lungs were of a darker blue than usual. Upon a gene∣ral view of the abdominial viscera, they appear∣ed to be sound. The scrotum was gangrenous. In one of the arms, there was the mark of a re∣cent incision, made by a lancet.</P>
<P>THIS was undoubtedly a case of the most vio∣lent peripneumony. According to the common practice, the patient would have been repeatedly bled. Would the abstraction of blood have pro∣duced a resolution of the adhesions, which were found in the thorax? The greatest partizan of the practice, I think, would scarcely affirm it. According to the confused notions entertained of peripneumony being a disease of excessive ex∣citement, it becomes necessary, in order to pre∣serve some appearance of consistency, to divide
<PB N="93" REF="033254_0085_0ff6a871b46ada90"/>
the disease into different stages; and to use a different or even an opposite plan of treatment, in each. Is it possible that any disease can vary in its progress, excepting in degree? And if not, ought the powers applied for the cure to be varied, in the progress of any disease, except∣ing in their degree of force? These would ap∣pear to be the conclusions of reason and com∣mon sense. But to overturn such flimsy ar∣guments, come in medical hypotheses and say
<Q>inflammation we <HI>suppose</HI> arises from an increas∣ed impetus of the blood in the part affected, and is <HI>therefore</HI> to be cured by diminishing the quantity of that blood. In peripneumo∣ny, there is an inflammation of the lungs; and in order to cure the disease, the impetus of the blood in the lungs must be lessened by blood-letting.</Q>
To this curious fabric of "reasoning, I will just oppose a single fact.— There is not an inflammation, with which we are acquainted, that is not to be cured (as far as it is curable) by the application of stimulant pow∣ers,—as warm fomentations, tincture of opium, tincture of cantharides, camphorated spirits, aether, volatile alkali, and mercury. If any per∣son seriously doubts the fact, it will be an easy matter to submit it to the test of experiment.— And if there be any other reason, for persever∣ing in the practice of blood-letting, than be∣cause it is derived from the hypotheses of the
<PB N="94" REF="033254_0086_0ff6a873c75ecb88"/>
schools, and is conformable to custom, let it be produced. That blood-letting had been used, in this case, previous to the patient's having been sent into the hospital, appears probable from the incision in the arm:—that he was purged is known. As catharticks, however, produce an increased degree of excitement, before the debili∣tating operation of purging succeeds, their stimu∣lant effects will often more than counterbalance the indirectly debilitating effects, which after∣wards arise. But as blood-letting is a directly debilitating operation,— the abstraction of an or¦dinary and powerful stimulus,—it must always be highly injurious. In diseases of direct debility, as far as they can become subjects of medical treat∣ment, it must add to the accumulation; in those of indirect debility, it must increase the exhausti∣on (<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide, "View of the Science of Life," Prop. XXVI.</NOTE>). It is upon the supposition alone that some diseases depend upon a state of excessive excite∣ment, that blood-letting can ever be thought admissible. And that such a state does not exist has, in my opinion been fully proved. I know it will be urged, by individuals, that they have found blood-letting useful. But this, like many other medical facts, is mere assertion, not proof. Whatever has been useful in one case, must be useful in every similar case of dis∣ease. But it is not so with blood-letting.—It
<PB N="95" REF="033254_0087_0ff66b695e6c0e30"/>
has not invariably been found useful in any one disease. We may therefore, I think, fairly con∣clude, that it has never been useful in any one case of disease. If it be said that this is reason∣ing, and that experience; let me be permit∣ted to ask whether just reasoning and real experi∣ence can ever differ? It is impossible.—Whate∣ver is true in theory, must be right in practice. To inculcate a contrary opinion is the grand shield of empiricism. Circumstances delivered as facts, from the presumed experience of indivi∣duals, ought never to weigh against principles, which are deduced from numerous and undoubt∣ed facts, and which can be put to the test of ex∣periment by all mankind.</P>
<P>THE quantity of calomel given here was large. But after taking two scruples at two doses, and allowing time for the operation of purging from indirect debility to take place, only one scanty stool was produced. This shews clearly, that, although the quantity was large, in proportion to what is usually given, it was by no means sufficiently large in proportion to the exhaustion of excitability that had taken place; or, in other words, to the violence of the disease. Altho' it be extremely doubtful whether the excitability can ever be accumulated to the healthy standard, by any degree of stimulant power, when so many
<PB N="96" REF="033254_0088_0ff6a876686fc6b0"/>
principal organs have become unable to perform their functions; yet it is certain that, in order to give a patient, in such cirumstances, the only chance of cure, the stimuli should be increased in power, until they produce some effect. In this case, therefore, the medicines should have been both increased in quantity, and more frequently repeated. But as, in every kind of practice, the prejudices of patients, or carelessness of attend∣ants, will frequently render it impossible strictly to adhere to the application of principles, we can only make such an approach to them, as these, and other circumstances, will permit.</P>
<P>HAD it not been my wish to bring the theory and practice of this doctrine to the fullest and fair∣est proof of discussion and experiment, this is one of those cases which I would have suppress∣ed. It is to be regretted that writers do not oft∣ener think it necessary to publish their unsuccess∣ful, as well as their successful cases.</P>

standing. He had 10 or 12 stools in the day, with blood; and complained much of headach, pain of loins, griping, and tenesmus. He lay ea∣siest on his right side. His pulse was 108: and he had frequently a flush in both cheeks. I be∣gan by giving him small doses of calomel, fre∣quently repeated; frictions of mercurial oint∣ment; and draughts of 70 or 80 drops of tinc∣ture of opium, repeated according to circumstan∣ces, through the night. In the course of a few days, the calomel was increased to six grains, with two grains of opium, every two hours; an ounce and a half of ointment was rubbed in at four times, in the course of the day; and draughts, with two hundred drops of tincture of opium <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some cases of dysentery will require much more than this quantity. It is to be recollected however, that the laudanum was weaker, perhaps one third, than what is commonly used in Europe.</NOTE> in each, were given, every second hour, during the night. The calomel was occasionally alter∣nated with camphor, and the tincture of opium with aether. Blisters were applied, and glysters of castor oil frequently given. These applications were made in concourse or succession; and increas∣ed or diminished in strength, according to the judgment formed of the state of the excitement, at the time. For a fortnight he seemed to get bet∣ter;
<PB N="98" REF="033254_0090_0ff6a7dd9d9fa9f8"/>
at one time, the purging rather decreased, and he had no blood in his stools. But from his mouth not being affected, so as to produce an in∣creased flow of saliva, after having used an uncom∣mon quantity of mercury; from frequent sickness and vomiting; his always lying on the right side; some degree of silliness and anxiety; an occasion∣al flush of the cheeks; and his having no appear∣ance of getting better upon the whole; I conclud∣ed, although there was no apparant enlargement, that his liver was diseased.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By disease of the liver is meant, that state in which it is incapable of performing its functions, whether it consist in in∣flammation, suppuration, induration, enlargement, &amp;c.</NOTE> The medicines, how∣ever, were continued, with a view of supporting the excitement, with as much equality as possible. He continued nearly in the same state as at first de∣scribed, until the 14th of November, when his pulse (which had varied throughout from 64 to 108, with intermissions occasionally) increased in frequency to 120. His tongue became very dry and glossy. On the 15th, together with his other symptoms, he had a severe hiccup, and intermis∣sion of the pulse after every 7th or 8th beat. On the 16th the hiccup was severe and incessant; his pulse 116, and intermittent; he had no power in his extremities—and at ten o'clock P. M. he died.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="033254_0091_0ff6a88020e5e3e8"/>IN tedious illness, patients naturally get dis∣gusted with their medicines in the course of some weeks, or their attendants become negligent. Although both these circumstances happened, in some degree, in this case, the directions were upon the whole observed with much punctuality. From the beginning a cure was not expected. For in every similar case, of between twenty and thirty that were opened by myself, and some by Dr. Yates, the appearances of local disease were so much alike, that I can now almost venture to pronounce, from the symptoms, in what state the viscera will be found, upon dissection. In this case, I was so certain the liver was diseased, that it was mentioned in the daily report some time before his death. Upon dissection, there were found several abscesses in both lobes of the liver, communicating with each other, and con∣taining, in all, about one pound of matter, of a thick consistence and white colour. On the upper surface, there were five or six ulcers, com∣municating with the abscesses. The edge of the right lobe, a part of the colon in contact with it, and part of the diaphragm, at its origin from the cartilages of the ninth and tenth ribs, were all sphacelated. The intestines, omentum, &amp;c. were adhering throughout.</P>

<HEAD>CASE XI.</HEAD>
<P>THOMAS KELLAN, aged 28, was ad∣mitted into the General Hospital, at Calcutta, on the 2d of October, 1796, with dysentery of five weeks standing, accompanied by pain in the region of the liver. He had the usual symptoms of griping, tenesmus, and a discharge of blood; generally lay either upon his right side, or in a sitting position; in the latter of which he found most ease. He was frequently sick, and vomit∣ed. His tongue was white and furred; and his pulse 104. Four grains of calomel, and one grain of opium were given every hour. One ounce of mercurial ointment, and half an ounce of calomel were rubbed in. On the 4th, he was easier, and had slept well. His tongue and pulse remained as before. The ointment was ordered to be rub∣bed in, morning and evening, and the pills to be continued<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the commencement of this case, two mistakes were made: one in not giving draughts at night, and the other in not rubbing the ointment at shorter intervals.</NOTE>; he was allowed eight glasses of
<PB N="101" REF="033254_0093_0ff6a884484a1db8"/>
wine in the twenty four hours<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This quantity was by far too little. In a case like this, a wine glassful every hour, would not have been too much.</NOTE>.—Eight o'clock P. M. he had slept much during the day; pulse 120; he was in other respects much as before.— 5th, his pulse was 120, and he complained of weakness. He had six or seven stools, without blood; and was much inclined to dose. He complained of considerable pain, and burning sensations, in the region of the liver. A blister was ordered to be applied; and two grains of opium, with eight grains of calomel, to be given every hour. He was allowed twenty glasses of wine in the twenty four hours.—6th, he had tak∣en ten doses of the opium and calomel. Was much vomited and purged, and had some degree of fever during the night<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In consequence of the irregular exhibition of the pills. This frequently happens, when pills are given in the day, and discontinued at night; or where draughts are not given at night, in lieu of them.</NOTE>; but was then bet∣ter. Pulse 108. The pain in the region of the liver was somewhat relieved. A pill of one grain of opium and four of calomel was ordered to be taken every hour; a draught with one hun∣dred and fifty drops of tincture of opium, to be given at eight o'clock P. M.; and to be repeated at twelve. The ointment was continued.—7th, he slept well, and had only two stools. Had taken seven pills, and the draughts; pulse 100.
<PB N="102" REF="033254_0094_0ff6a88be6beced8"/>
The pills, ointment, and draughts, were conti∣nued.—8th, he was considerably better; had five or six stools. He had taken eleven pills, and the draughts. The pills, ointment, and the draughts reduced to 100 drops, were continued. —9th, he had taken ten pills, and one draught; had some stools yesterday, but none last night. Pulse 100: no sickness. The medicines were continued.—10th, having begun to get indiffer∣ent about taking his medicines, they were varied, in order to humour him. Instead of the pills, a mixture consisting of half an ounce of tincture of opium, and one pint of water, was given, in divided portions, in the day. This was again alternated with pills. Blisters were repeatedly applied, and the draughts were continued; but the pain and burning sensations over all his ab∣domen sickness and vomiting; frequency of stools with blood; smallness of the pulse, &amp;c. seemed to be rather increasing. On the 14th, the tincture of opium in the mixture was increas∣ed to an ounce and a half, to one pound of wa∣ter, of which he was ordered to take an ounce every half hour; the ointment was omitted, and the draughts continued. On the 15th, he said that he had been easier the day before; but, hav∣ing become irregular in taking his draughts, he was frequently purged and griped at night. From that period till the 23d, the opium and calomel, from two to four grains of the one, and
<PB N="103" REF="033254_0095_0ff6a7ff77496970"/>
from six to ten grains of the other, were alter∣nated with the mixture; the ointment was rub∣bed occasionally; and the draughts, with from 60 to 100 drops of tincture of opium were giv∣en at night, or 3 or 4 grains of opium, which∣ever he seemed inclined to prefer. From the 23d of October, to the 18th of November, he appeared to be so much better, that, although confident of the existence of much internal local disease, I was not without hopes, that it was of such a degree as to admit of a reproduction of parts. His pulse varied from 80 to 96. The doses of medicines were considerably diminished. Camphor, four grains every two hours, was al∣ternated occasionally with the calomel and opi∣um. Glysters, with one ounce of castor oil, were sometimes given every hour, or every two hours; and two pounds of decoction of bark, with an ounce of powder, was given in the day. The ointment, and calomel pills were gradually di∣minished, to two drachms of the former, four times in the day; and two grains of the latter, every two hours. His sickness and vomiting still recurred. The burning sensations of the abdomen continued. And he was sensible of a feverish exacerbation every third day.—Nov. the 17th, the pills were omitted, and the other medicines continued.—18th, he had not taken any of his medicines the day before. Complain∣ed
<PB N="104" REF="033254_0096_0ff6a890abb583a0"/>
of the offensive smell of his breath. This was evidently occasioned by leaving off the medi∣cines. Being tired of all those to which he had been accustomed, I thought it might be of use to try the effects of hepar sulphuris, to remove the offensive smell of his breath, and prescribed one drachm three times a day. The other me∣dicines (viz. decoction of bark, glysters, and draughts) were at the same time, desired to be continued.—20th, he had frequent sickness, and vomiting; much purging, and great thirst. No appetite; and a sense of burning heat in his stomach and intestines. Common flowers of sul∣phur had been given, instead of the hepor sul∣phuris. They were desired to be omitted. Two pounds of decoction of bark, with half an ounce of aether, was given, in the course of the day; and the draughts were repeated.—22d, his symp∣toms continued as before. There was an evi∣dent enlargement of the right lobe of the liver; but no perceptible undulation. From that pe∣riod, he had two pounds of decoction of bark, with two hundred drops of tincture of opium, in the day; the draughts occasionally at night; calomel, castor oil, and other medicines were also given, and alternated, so as to prevent, as much as possible, his being disgusted with a same∣ness of treatment. But the symptoms were ra∣ther increasing in violence. The purging became
<PB N="105" REF="033254_0097_0ff6a89d816e68c8"/>
more severe, with blood in his stools; sickness and vomiting more frequent; he complained much of heart-burn; and had sometimes feverish paroxysms, which seemed to be of a quartan type. There was, from the beginning, a flush in both cheeks, like those of a consumptive person. He complained of insensibility of the back, and weakness of the extremities. From all these cir∣cumstances, and from no increased flow of saliva having been produced by the mercury, I conclud∣ed that there was such a degree of local disease, as to render the case incurable, by any treatment that was possible, in such a situation, to be pur∣sued. It was, however, persisted in, with as much regularity as was practicable. He conti∣nued gradually sinking, until the 2d of December, when he died.</P>
<P>UPON dissection, the left lung was found ad∣hering strongly to all the neighbouring parts. Its substance was unusually dry, hard, and yel∣low; and appeared as if it had not, for some time, transmitted blood, or performed its proper functions. The liver weighed about five pounds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The average weight of a sound liver, I believe, may be about three pounds and an half, or perhaps somewhat more.</NOTE>, was considerably indurated, but had undergone no suppuration. The other abdominal viscera were adhering, in such a manner as to form but one mass; with the exception of the spleen, which
<PB N="106" REF="033254_0098_0ff6a89f755624f0"/>
had a sound appearance.—The coecum, colon, and rectum, were ulcerated throughout their whole extent. The ulcers were, in many places, an inch in diameter; and had penetrated the two inner coats. It is somewhat remarkable that, in between thirty and forty cases of dysentery which I have seen opened, there was not, in a single in∣stance, any of the scybala mentioned by authors, as a symptom of that disease.</P>
<P>THE uncommon quantity of mercury that was here used, without being followed by any affecti∣on of the mouth, was a sufficient proof that there existed a lesion of organs, which, if curable, re∣quired the application of still higher powers than those that were employed. Even in external lo∣cal affections, it is now well known, that a cure depends more upon the support of the general ex∣citement, than upon local applications. The cure then, of internal local disease, were it even possible to apply local remedies, must still be per∣formed by the application of powers, calculated to support the general excitement.</P>
<P>WE have yet, perhaps, no adequate idea of the degree of power, that may sometimes be re∣quired, to produce this effect. But it is very certain that, while in some cases by far too little, in others by far too much of stimulant power is applied. Mercury, for instance, in cases of dy∣sentery, is generally used in too small proporti∣ons,
<PB N="107" REF="033254_0099_0ff6a8a21f9c77e0"/>
while in venereal cases, it is by much too freely given. Half a grain of calomel, or less, given every two or three hours, will in a short time effect a cure in ordinary cases of chancre, gonorrhoea, or even a certain degree of syphilis. In these cases, there is seldom any great degree of organic lesion, at least of those organs which are most essential to life. It is only when some of the primary organs are in a state of local dis∣ease, that a great and long continued application, of high stimulant powers, becomes necessary, in order to re-produce health. Of this, dysentery is one of the most familiar and fatal examples.</P>
<P>The diminution of the medicines that was made at one period, upon the prospect of the pa∣tient being better, was injudicious. Although, in such a case, no plan would probably have suc∣ceeded, a perseverance in the regular application of high exciting powers, would have given him one chance of recovery.</P>
<P>THE offensive state of his breath, of which he complained on the 18th of November, was evi∣dently occasioned by the subduction of the medi∣cines. This is a symptom of indirect debility, as well as salivation, purging, sweat, or any other effect of an irregular application, or sudden sub∣duction, of mercury. That these effects are so frequently produced, by the ordinary mode of ex∣hibiting
<PB N="108" REF="033254_0100_0ff6a7e2f1c16958"/>
that medicine, ought not to surprise us. It is also obvious that if, when given at random, this and other medicines of high stimulant pow∣er so frequently produce good effects, their salu∣tary effects, when applied according to just prin∣ciples, may be expected to surpass any thing, of which we can yet form an idea.</P>

<HEAD>CASE XII.</HEAD>
<P>JOHN CLUFF, aged 30, was admitted into the General Hospital, at Calcutta, on the 18th of November, 1796, with a dysentery of some days standing. He had incessant calls to stool, passed blood, with severe griping, tenes∣mus, and prolapsus ani. His thirst was intense; and he seemed in dreadful agony, from lancinat∣ing pains. Six grains of opium, and eight grains of calomel, were ordered to be given every hour; a glyster, with three ounces of castor oil, and three ounces of warm water every hour; and half an ounce of mercurial ointment to be rub∣bed in, four times in the day. A bottle of Ma∣deira, in two quarts of barley water, was pre∣scribed for drink. At twelve o'clock, A. M. he had taken two of the pills, and seemed easier.
<PB N="109" REF="033254_0101_0ff6a8aad831e8a0"/>
In consequence of a consultation, the pills were or∣dered to be omitted, and two ounces of the follow∣ing mixture to be given every half hour;—viz. Sal. Cathart. Amar. ten drachms, Crem. Tart. two drachms, Tart. Emetic two grains, water one pint. A draught, with one hundred drops of tincture of opium, was ordered at eight o'clock, and another at twelve. November the 19th, after having taken the mixture, he was both vo∣mited and purged. These operations continued occasionally during the night, and were not en∣tirely stopped by the draughts. His pulse was 92, tongue foul, and thirst intense; he complain∣ed of great pain across the umbilical region; and passed blood in his stools. The mixture was ordered to be repeated; the ointment and glysters to be continued; warm fomentations to be used; and three draughts, with one hundred and fifty drops of tincture of opium in each, were ordered to be given at night, at intervals of three hours. No∣vember the 20th, he was much better. His tongue, however, was foul. The glysters did not seem to produce much effect. The mix∣ture, ointment and draughts were ordered to be repeated; and the glysters to be disconti∣nued.—21st, having, on the evening of the 19th, taken his three draughts at once, in the course of yesterday, he became rather confused; and was dissuaded, by one of his comrades, from tak∣ing
<PB N="110" REF="033254_0102_0ff6a8af3425f9c0"/>
the draughts the night before as prescribed. He appeared much confused; but the purging was less severe. The mixture, ointment, and draughts, with one hundred drops in each, were desired to be repeated. 22d, he was again dis∣suaded, with the best intentions however, from taking his draughts; in consequence of which his confusion increased, and he ran about the ward, in a state of considerable derangement, all night. I represented to his friend, who had with-held the medicines through kindness, the danger of persevering in such conduct; and en∣treated that he would exhibit the doses exactly as they were prescribed, which he afterwards punctually did. But in order to ensure a com∣pliance, I thought it best occasionally to vary the remedies, and to use such as should fall in with the prejudices of the patient and his friend. Accordingly one drachm of jallap was immedi∣ately given. The warm bath was desired to be used three times a day; and after the bath, two drachms of mercurial ointment to be rub∣bed in each time.—When the operation of purg∣ing should commence, after the exhibition of the jallap, a pill, consisting of four grains of opium, and six of calomel, was directed to be given every hour; and to be continued through the night, in lieu of the draughts.—23d, in the course of
<PB N="111" REF="033254_0103_0ff6a801c84c63c0"/>
the preceding day and night, he had taken nine pills, consisting of four grains of opium and six of calomel each. He slept well; had little purg∣ing; and was free from pain. He only complained of weakness and thirst. The pills were re∣duced to two grains of opium, and four grains of calomel, every two hours. The ointment was continued; and the bath and glysters omitted.— 24th, he was better. He still passed some blood by stool, and had a difficulty in making water. He complained that his mouth was sore. These symptoms I judged to have arisen, either from the subduction of stimulus the day before having been two great, or the patient having neglected to take the quantity that was prescribed. The medicines were desired to be continued; and the patient was particularly enjoined to take them regularly.—25th, his mouth was less sore, he had fewer stools, and no blood in them; his skin was moist and his pulse 80.—26th, pulse 88, and smaller. Purging and griping continued. By mistake, he had no pills during the night. This fully accounted for the alteration since the day before. He was ordered to have a quart of de∣coction of bark, with two hundred drops of tinc∣ture of opium, to be taken in divided doses through the day. Two drachms of mercurial ointment, and one drachm of calomel, were rub∣bed
<PB N="112" REF="033254_0104_0ff6a8b16318c590"/>
in four times in the day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On the 26th and 27th there was an omission, in not pre∣scribing draughts or pills, sufficient to support the excitement in the night.</NOTE>. On the 27th, he was rather better; the medicines were continu∣ed; on the 28th, he was much the same; the decoction, with two hundred drops of tincture of opium, was continued.—He did not always take the whole of the decoction; but generally more than two thirds of it. The ointment was diminished to one drachm four times in the day; and two draughts, with eighty drops of tincture of opium in each, were ordered to be given in the night.—29th, he had taken the draughts and slept well; had only one stool; pulse 84;— tongue clean; he felt some degree of oppression about the pit of the stomach; a blister was appli∣ed; the ointment was omitted; the decoction of bark, with tincture of opium, was ordered to be continued; and the draughts to be re∣duced to sixty drops. From that period, he continued to get better. The stimuli were in∣creased, or diminished, according to cir∣cumstances; and on the 12th of December, he was discharged without any complaint, except∣ing a little griping at times. At his own request, he had a small phial of tincture of opium, and some pills, with directions how to take them, if
<PB N="113" REF="033254_0105_0ff6a8b39625f3d0"/>
required, before he could join his ship at Dia∣mond Harbour.</P>
<P>WHEN, in consequence of consultations, as happened in this case, cathartics were exhibited, I endeavoured so to manage them, as regularly to support the excitement; and to prevent, as far as possible, the state of indirect debility, which con∣stitutes vomiting and purging, by exhibiting other stimuli, on the commencement of these opera∣tions. But this is generally very difficult to ac∣complish, principally from the ideas, which pa∣tients traditionally imbibe, of the utility of these operations.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the hitherto uncertain state of the art, it is not surprizing that consultations, in which, to use the words of an elegant writer," learned physicians neutralize their plans,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aikin's Letters to his Son.</NOTE>" should seldom be productive of benefit to patients. They are too often scenes of mutual complaisance, in which he, who has most to gain, sacrifices most of his opinion. This has been a subject of much re∣gret to sensible men of the profession; and such scenes have consequently been avoided by many of them. It is no mean proof of the truth of the medical principles, asserted in these pages, that
<PB N="114" REF="033254_0106_0ff6a804b3387510"/>
two persons, who thoroughly understand them, will differ, but in a very small degree, in their ap∣plication to practice. In this respect, I have known a coincidence so perfect, that it could, in no other manner, be accounted for. Their general adop∣tion, then, would banish that vulgar adage, which, at present, not undeservedly attaches a degree of ridicule to the cultivators of the healing art, "doc∣tors differ."</P>
<P>IN the report of the 24th of November, it is ob∣served, that the patient had a difficulty in making water, and a soreness of the mouth, which were judged to have arisen, either from the subduc∣tion of stimulus, on the 23d, having been too great, or his having neglected to use the quantity prescribed. This is not hypothesis; but a clear induction of facts. It is certain, that a difficulty of making water, is a symptom that arises from a state of indirect debility, whether that succeeds the exhibition of cantharides, opium, or any other stimulant power. It is also true, that it may be cured by opium, the warm bath, or cantharides. The general mode of applying blisters is such, as often to induce that state; and is therefore im∣proper. Blisters of a small size, frequently repeat∣ed, will produce a regular excitement, like succes∣sive frictions of mercurial ointment. But they ought not to lay on the skin ten or twelve hours;
<PB N="115" REF="033254_0107_0ff6a8b5a28dcf58"/>
nor so long as to be succeeded by vesication, which is a state of indirect debility. Neither is it neces∣sary that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey should be applied, in preference, to any particular spot. For, although they make the first, and a somewhat greater impression, upon the part, with which they come immediately in con∣tact; yet, to whatever part of the body they are ap∣plied, their action will extend to every other. The action of stimuli upon the excitability, may be compared to an electric shock, which, seemingly at the same instant of time, affects every person in company,—the nearest and the most distant from the phial. When the <HI>modus operandi</HI> of the one is ascertained, we may expect to ascertain the <HI>mo∣dus operandi</HI> of the other.</P>
<P>IN the preceding, as well as in many other ca∣ses, medicines were often exhibited improperly; sometimes from omissions in prescribing, some∣times from negligence or mistakes of attendants, and sometimes from the prejudices of the patient.</P>
<P>WITH any number of patients, there cannot be much difficulty in prescribing, according to the old plan of practice, which consists in giving cer∣tain fixed doses of medicines, in every disease, whatever be its degree. But justly to proportion the application of stimulant powers, to the ex∣haustion of the excitability of each patient, re∣quires more exertion of judgment and considera∣tion, on the part of the practitioner, and a stric∣ter conformity with directions, on the part of the
<PB N="116" REF="033254_0108_0ff6a8ba644dd6a8"/>
patient, and of the attendants. It is evident then that, in an hospital, it requires an unusual degree of exertion to apply these principles to practice, in from thirty to forty bad cases of disease, daily. But it is their introduction only that is difficult. Once generally admitted, their application would be attended with as much facility, and certainly with more pleasure, because with more success, than any routine of empiricism.</P>

<HEAD>CASE XIII.</HEAD>
<P>ISAAC HUDSON, aged 30, was admit∣ted into the General Hospital, at Calcutta, on the 31st of October, 1796, with the following symptoms: Pulse 132, and small. He had for some time feverish paroxysms, at 11 o'clock, A. M. and 11 P. M. which continued between two and three hours. Tongue foul; skin hot; his bowels were quite irregular, sometimes extremely loose, at other times excessively costive. He had a cough, with hoarseness; and pains of the bones and joints. Together with these com∣plaints, he had chancres of a fortnight's stand∣ing.—One grain of opium and one grain of calo∣mel were prescribed every hour; and two drachms of mercurial ointment were ordered to
<PB N="117" REF="033254_0109_0ff6a8bf1379a820"/>
be rubbed in, three times in the day. Novem∣ber the 1st, pulse 96. The fever and purging continued. His pains were rather less severe. His tongue was very white. Ten grains of calo∣mel were given every three hours. On the 2d, his pulse was 92. He had taken four doses of the calomel. His tongue was less soul. Eight grains of calomel were ordered every three hours, day and night.—3d, pulse 88; he had taken eight doses of the calomel. He had a sore throat and hoarseness, with an incipient spitting. The calomel was omitted, because it was deem∣ed highly probable that he would not have taken it, if prescribed. Three grains of opium were given every hour. And three drachms of oint∣ment were ordered to be rubbed in, three or four times in the day.—4th, his mouth and throat were very sore, and he spit some blood; from whence it was concluded, that he had omitted to take his medicines, or that he had used them in an irregular manner. A blister was applied to one of his cheeks; two grains of opium were giv∣en every two hours; and a glyster, with one ounce of castor oil, was ordered every two hours. He was allowed four glasses of wine in the day. On the 5th, his mouth became very sore, and there was some increased flow of saliva. A blis∣ter was applied to the other cheek; the pills and glysters were continued; and he was allowed six
<PB N="118" REF="033254_0110_0ff6a8c1b80dbb40"/>
glasses of wine.—6th, his mouth became exceed∣ingly sore, and his face more swelled. He had no stool; a blister<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Among patients, upon whose veracity there is not much dependence, I prefer in these cases, the use of blisters, up∣on this principle, that they cannot deceive.</NOTE> was applied to his breast. The pills were ordered to be continued, and a glys∣ter, with two ounces of castor oil, to be given every second hour.—7th, he was much in the same state; the medicines were ordered to be con∣tined. On the 8th, he had some difficulty of breathing, his pulse was exceedingly small, and he had fainting fits. Upon enquiry, it was found that he had lately neglected to take the medicines, which he himself confessed. In order to ensure compliance in this respect, a change was made in the medicines. He was put into the warm bath three times in the day. The glysters were con∣tinued. And he had three draughts, with one hundred drops of tincture of opium in each, at regular intervals in the night. 9th, he was better; his pulse was 108 and stronger. Cough less severe; and swelling of the face abated. The bath, and glysters were ordered to be repeated; and a draught, with forty drops of tincture of opi∣um, to be given every hour.—10th, he was much in the same state; the medicines were con∣tinued.

—11th, his breath was very foetid, and tongue much swelled; which evinced that he had been irregular in taking his medicines. A blister was applied to his neck, and the other medicines were continued—12th, he was rather better; the medicines were continued; and two drachms of ointment were ordered to be rubbed in, twice a day.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was too seldom.

The ointment and glysters were continued; and he was enjoined to use his me∣dicines regularly. The following mixture was given,—decoction of bark two poun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, powder of bark one ounce, tincture of opium one hun∣dred and fifty drops; the whole of it was order∣ed to be taken, in divided portions, in the day. The draughts were continued as before. From that period, he got gradually better. His mouth became more or less sore, in the exact proporti∣on of the regularity, with which he took his me∣dicines.
<PB N="120" REF="033254_0112_0ff6a8c6fb430540"/>
By that symptom, I could detect his irregularites. He continued, for some time, subject to purging, and slight paroxysms of fe∣ver occasionally. But, by a perseverance in the same plan of treatment, diminution of the me∣dicines, he remained, on the 13th of December, free from complaint, excepting a slight soreness of the mouth. And on the 14th, when I discon∣tinued attending him, he was in an advanced state of convalescence.</P>
<P>THIS is one of those cases, which shew that sore∣ness of the mouth, and salivation, do not arise from the action of mercury, when regularly appli∣ed, and gradually decreased; but that these, and other symptoms of indirect debility, arise in con∣sequence of its irregular application, or sudden subduction. This patient, like many others, was so sensible of the truth of the above observation that, after there was a necessity for using the warm bath, he took his medicines with much regulari∣ty, until he became convalescent. He was, from repeated experience, convinced that the soreness of his mouth increased, upon the subduction of the mercury, opium, or warm bath.</P>
<P>FROM the beginning, I was doubtful of a recov∣ery. For, a small and quick pulse, hoarseness and difficulty of breathing, and the very irregular state of his bowels, indicated that some degree of local

affection, both of the thoracic and abdominal vis∣cera, had taken place. From the issue, however, it appeared that they were of such a degree, as to admit of a regeneration of organs.</P>

On the 7th, having discontinued his medi∣cines the day before, his mouth became very sore, and an encreased flow of saliva commenced. The pills were ordered to be reduced to six grains of calo∣mel, and three grains of opium; the draughts to be repeated; and the ointment to be omitted. But as I had no reliance on his taking the pills regular∣ly, a quart of decoction of bark, with a hundred drops of tincture of opium, was ordered to be ta∣ken in the day, to prevent his mouth from becom∣ing excessively sore.—8th, did not take the pills on account, as he said, of his having some diffi∣culty in swallowing them; but took the decoction and draughts; pulse 100; his mouth continued sore, and the flow of saliva increased. Three drachms of mercurial ointment were ordered to be rubbed in, four times in the day; and he was informed that, if he did not allow it to be regular∣ly applied, his mouth would become much sorer. The decoction and draughts were continued; and the pills omitted.—9th, he spit freely; and seem∣ed much better. The decoction and draughts were continued; and the ointment omitted. From that period, he was convalescent. And on the 14th of

December, when I discontinued attending him, he had no complaint, excepting the soreness of his mouth; which, however, was rapidly decreasing.</P>
<P>WHEN the medicines were increased to a due degree, as on the 3d of December, the patient speedily got better; and had he continued to take them with regularity throughout, he would have got well much sooner. He had however taken a sufficient quantity, to be succeeded by an increased flow of saliva. And after that symptom occurred, he was considered as out of dan∣ger.</P>
<P>IN the foregoing cases, in general, the state of the pulse has been noted with some care. The pulse in all its degrees of quickness, slowness, weakness, irregularity, and intermission, may be considered as a kind of thermometer, by which, together with the state of other functions, some judgment may be formed of the state of the ex∣citement. A deviation from health in the state of the pulse, is one of the most constant symp∣toms of indirect debility. But the surest crite∣rion yet known, by which to estimate the degree of exhaustion, is the effect produced, by the sti∣mulant powers, applied for the cure.</P>
<P>WHEN the effects of the mercurial ointment were not deemed sufficiently powerful, calomel
<PB N="126" REF="033254_0118_0ff6a8db9cb067f8"/>
was added. The ointment used was the strong∣est; but the quick-silver was not always suffici∣ently triturated. It is almost unnecessary to ob∣serve that, in dangerous cases, mercury may at the same time be used, both internally and exter∣nally, with advantage.</P>
<P>THE explanations annexed to the cases will, perhaps, appear unnecessarily copious; and, in some parts mere repetitions. But that was deemed the most familiar, and therefore, in some respects, the best mode of illustrating the subject.

<P>THE preceding cases, it will be observed, are not particularly selected from such as termi∣nated happily. Those only that were deemed most instructive, in illustrating particular points, have been chosen. Many more of equal impor∣tance might have been added; but the publica∣tion would thus have become too voluminous. None of them are offered, as approaching to per∣fect examples; but merely as conveying a ge∣neral idea of the mode, in which, according to our opinion, the principles of the doctrine should be applied to practice.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH opium and mercury are the me∣dicines, upon which we have placed most depen∣dance, in diseases of high degree, as being more intimately acquainted with their powers; it is conceived that the doctrine, properly understood, embraces the whole range of the Materia Medica. It does not admit, indeed, of any other effect being produced, by the application of any power in nature, to living bodies, than an increase or
<PB N="128" REF="033254_0120_0ff6a8de40bcf318"/>
diminution of the vigor, with which they per∣form their proper functions; i. e. an increase or diminution of their excitement. With a view to the excitement solely is every medicine what∣ever prescribed. And when the means employ∣ed are unsuccessful, the failure should be attri∣buted to a want of judgment in their application, rather than to any error in the principles them∣selves.</P>
<P>IT ought not to be overlooked that, in most of the foregoing examples, the diseases were those of the greatest exhaustion, occurring among a set of men (soldiers, mariners, &amp;c.) possessing robust constitutions, and accustomed to the ap∣plication of high degrees of stimulant power. In diseases of warm climates, in general, the ex∣haustion is much greater than in those of cold climates. Perhaps too, in the former, the me∣dicines lose much of their strength, before they come into use. So that a material difference will be required in the practice. Another caution that deserves to be attended to, in all countries, is to guard against the application of cold, dur∣ing the operation of high exciting powers. For, when the smallest degree of indirect debility hap∣pens to take place, from irregularity in the ap∣plication of these powers, the application of cold, or, to speak more correctly, the subduction of
<PB N="129" REF="033254_0121_0ff6a7ebb01d71a0"/>
heat, will increase the exhaustion, and add to the force of the disease.</P>
<P>THE strenuous and authoritative manner, in which this doctrine has always been opposed, renders a knowledge of its application to prac∣tice difficult to be obtained, even by those who thoroughly understand its principles. The laws of mechanics may be perfectly well understood. But if a body of artificers, who had from time, immemorial conducted the operative part, in to∣tal ignorance of those laws, were unanimously to declare,
<Q>that the principals might indeed be both ingenious and just, for aught they knew, but that they were dangerous in their applica∣tion to practice,</Q>
it is certain that the pub∣lic would for a time, be deceived by the repre∣sentations of these workmen; and the principles of mechanics, however just or applicable, could not generally be reduced to practice, until the deception ceased. Moral truths may be perfect∣ly well understood by a few; but the ignorance, prejudices, and passions of a great majority of the human race, will long retard their complete application to practice. Medical truths however have only to combat the prejudices and interests of a particular, and but a small body of men. It may therefore be permitted to hope, that their application to practi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, cannot be much longer delayed.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="033254_0122_0ff6a8e0ae365280"/>THOSE who have admired, and those who have opposed the new medical principles, without being masters of the subject, must have been equally unsuccessful, in their attempts to apply them to practice. By every succeeding case of failure, the admiration of the one would be di∣minished, the opposition of the other confirm∣ed. The objection, therefore, is very just, that
<Q>attempts to apply the principles of the Brunonian Doctrine to practice, may be dan∣gerous, in ignorant hands.</Q>
In other words, men cannot apply to practice principles, which they do not understand.—Let us suppose a per∣son, wholly unacquainted with the <HI>laws</HI> of liv∣ing bodies, applying <HI>powers</HI> to them; how can he be expected to produce a <HI>given effect?</HI> Over∣looking the immense variety of degrees, between the state of health, and the highest state of ex∣haustion, he would probably prescribe one grain of a solid medicine, when he should have pre∣scribed twenty; or twenty, when he should have prescribed but one; he would give twenty drops of a fluid, when he should have given two hun∣dred; or two hundred, when he should have given but twenty. He would repeat the medicine but once or twice in the twenty-four hours, instead of every hour, or every half hour, according to the duration of its action. He would use the strongest powers, instead of the weakest; and
<PB N="131" REF="033254_0123_0ff6a7f0c2c405e8"/>
the weakest instead of the strongest. He would not make any distinction between the delicate fe∣male, and the robust male frame; between child∣hood and youth, and youth and old age; be∣tween recent and long standing diseases. He would not even know how to make allowances for inveterate habits. In such hands, no success could be expected, any more than from a me∣chanic, who should employ equal powers to raise unequal weights. He might sometimes in∣deed be right by chance.</P>
<P>FAR otherwise is it with him who applies prin∣ciples to practice. He calculates, combines, and proportions his powers, according to known laws; and applies them, in such a manner, as to produce certain and given effects. Nor is the practice of medicine different, in this respect, from any other art, which is founded upon principle, and re∣quires a certain degree of mental exertion.</P>
<P>IN the preceding pages, some things may ap∣pear doubtful, the arrangement occasionally inac∣curate, and the whole requiring illustration. Was it not even too late, I should not think myself at liberty, without the approbation of my ingenious and esteemed friend, Dr. Yates, to make any material alter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/> in the text. But, in the mean time, it may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> proper to offer such re∣marks, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> by subsequent re∣flection,
<PB N="132" REF="033254_0124_0ff6a8e42cd7e390"/>
and may perhaps lead to an arrangement somewhat different, if ever an opportunity should occur of revising the subject.</P>
<P>IN the first place, diseases of accumulation, or of direct debility, appear to be even more rare than we have supposed them. For if, to a body in a state of accumulation, the ordinary stimuli be applied, a disease of exhaustion will immediately ensue. But a body can never long remain in a state of accumulation, without having the ordi∣nary degree of stimulant power applied, and sometimes even more. The accumulation, which is produced by the abstraction of heat, food, or the mental passions, if it be not immediately re∣moved, by the gradual re-application of these powers, will be converted into a state of exhaus∣tion, as soon as the ordinary exciting powers, which support the healthy state, are again appli∣ed. It is evident, them, that accumulation of the excitability, from the abstraction, or diminution of one or more stimuli, must soon terminate in the re-establishment of health, by the gradual re-application of these powers, or in the establish∣ment, of a state of exhaustion, or of indirect de∣bility, by their sudden and excessive re-applica∣tion. But it is difficult to suppose, such a com∣plete abstraction of heat, food or mental stimuli, as to occasion death, without the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tervention of
<PB N="133" REF="033254_0125_0ff6a8e65db22470"/>
some stimulant power, converting the state of ac∣cumulation into a state of indirect debility. When food and drink have been long with-held, even a draught of water will exhaust the excitability, and occasion death. Let us suppose a person travelling through a sandy desart, under the scorching rays of a vertical sun. If he was pre∣viously in a state of accumulation, from the ab∣straction of the ordinary stimuli, that would im∣mediately be converted into a state of exhaustion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This follows as a consequence from Prop. V. I. although not so stated in the text.</NOTE>. And a continuance of the abstraction, would still farther add to the exhaustion, until it terminated in death. When heat has been long abstracted, and to a considerable degree, a degree less than that which constitutes the common temperature, sudden∣ly applied, will produce mortification, or the death of a part. The case of the Roman mother, so aptly quoted by Brown, will exemplify the same principle, as applied to the mental stimuli. The state of torpor in which some animals remain, during the winter, and the manner of their re∣suscitation in the spring, even in a lower degree of temperature than that in which they became torpid, at the same time that it affords a beauti∣ful explication of the principles of this doctrine,
<PB N="134" REF="033254_0126_0ff6a8e979ee6220"/>
seems to shew, that death does not take place, from the mere abstraction of heat, or from ac∣cumulation of the excitability. In this state of prolonged sleep, while respiration is languidly performed, the other functions are diminished or entirely suspended. Thus in a two-fold manner, the excitability is accumulated, the susceptibility of impression is proportionally increased, and a degree of heat lower than that under which tor∣por took place in autumn, will produce healthy excitement in spring<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This idea is, in part, taken from Dr. Girtanner.</NOTE>. It seems very difficult to conceive, how death can ever take place from mere accumulation. For while excitability re∣mains, a due application of exciting powers will produce healthy excitement; and when it is ac∣cumulated in an unusual degree, it is only requir∣ed that a diminution of exciting powers, propor∣tionate to the accumulation, or to the susceptibi∣lity of impression, should be made, in order to produce the highest excitement. But in every case, in which death <HI>seems</HI> to take place from ac∣cumulation, it is easy to conceive, that it <HI>really</HI> happens from exhaustion. For, in the highest degrees of accumulation, for instance, when a liv∣ing body is nearly frozen, the smallest degree of exciting power, although greatly below the force
<PB N="135" REF="033254_0127_0ff6a8eba655d3d8" MS="y"/>
of the ordinary stimuli applied in a state of health, will be disproportionate to the susceptibility of im∣pression, and will therefore produce a state of ex∣haustion. And the farther subduction of heat, will increase the exhaustion so produced, until it ter∣minates in death. Upon the whole, it may, I think, be concluded, that death never takes place directly from accumulation; but always from ex∣haustion of the excitability. The state of accu∣mulation, then, when it does not terminate in health by the gradual re-application of exciting powers, must always terminate in a state of exhaustion, by the application of exciting powers, dispropor∣tionate to the state of the excitability. Scurvy therefore, and the other diseases which have been mentioned as arising from the abstraction of sti∣muli, would seem to be all diseases of exhausti∣on or of indirect debility. In proof of this, every case, that I have met with at sea, resembling what has been described by authors under the name of scurvy, yielded to mercury. It was so certain a cure, that I never thought of using any other remedy. Nor did it at all, when properly ex∣hibited, increase the debility of the patient. The reason why mercury has so often been found inju∣rious in scurvy, is, that it has seldom been given in a proper manner. The salvation, of which au∣thors complain, as being so easily excited, would never occur, if it was exhibited in such a manner,
<PB N="136" REF="033254_0128_0ff6a8f38b8aa2b8"/>
as regularly to support the excitement. It is now perfectly known, that this and every other symp∣tom of indirect debility, which succeed the use of mercury, arise from the subduction, not from the immediate action of that medicine. But where salivation actually takes place, after the applicati- of mercury, or other stimulant powers, many facts concur in shewing, that but a small degree of organic lesion exists; and if a patient, in that state, ever dies, it must be from subsequent mismanage∣ment. The complaints, therefore, against mer∣cury, in scurvy, and other diseases, are not justly to be attributed to the medicine, but to the abuse of it. There does not seem much difficulty in accounting for the bad effects, which have arisen from the abuse of mercury in that disease. As the proper principle, upon which that and every other medicine should be exhibited, as not being understood, the mode in which it was applied in scurvy, must necessarily have increased the exhau∣stion, or converted the original state of accumu∣lation, into a state of exhaustion; and the vicissi∣tudes of weather, that usually occur on board of ships, would increase still farther the exhaustion. It is in this way, and upon the principles explain∣ed in the text, that cold proves so injurious, dur∣ing the application of mercury, or other high ex∣citing powers, when they are unskilfully exhibit∣ed. Scurvy, in fact, appears to be a disease mere∣ly
<PB N="137" REF="033254_0129_0ff6a8f6ee5b3bb8" MS="y"/>
general, and in its origin of slight degree; at first arising from the subduction of nourishment, and the mental stimuli, and afterwards increased by an excessive, or irregular application of other exciting powers, and a continued negation of food sufficiently nourishing. Accordingly, the gradual re-application of food sufficiently nou∣rishing, and of the mental stimuli, is alone, for the most part, sufficient to cure the disease. It is upon the principle of the gradual re-application of nourishment, that vegetables have been found at first preferable to animal food. And this fact it was, if the above reasoning be right, that led to the error, committed in the text, of considering scurvy as a disease of accumulation.</P>
<P>WITH respect to the excitement and excitabili∣ty, a more elegant and just arrangement of the propositions might, no doubt, have been made. This defect, however, is not of material import∣ance; as the principles of the doctrine are still sufficiently intelligible; and every one, who un∣derstands them, as they now are▪ will be able to judge what they ought to be.</P>
<P>AN early and sincere admirer of this doctrine, for whose judgment I entertain a respect, hav∣ing expressed some doubts in regard to the non∣existence of diseases of excessive excitement, and requested me to re-consider the subject, a defer∣ence
<PB N="138" REF="033254_0130_0ff6a7f2b8202230"/>
for his opinion, and a wish to place the matter in a clearer point of view, induce me to enter upon a detail, which seemed at first un∣necessary. As the entire rejection of diseases of excessive-excitement, is a great deviation from the original doctrine, and one of very considera∣ble importance in its influence upon practice, I shall endeavour, by stating the grounds of it at some length, to obviate all reasonable objections to the theory. In this place, it may be proper to observe, that medical facts, as they have been called, are too often nothing more than a loose relation of circumstances. A fact, properly speak∣ing, must be so evidently true, that every man, possessing sound organs, may discern it. And the general facts, or principles, which are induc∣tions from partiular facts, may also be discerned by all men of ordinary capacities, who will take the trouble of going through the necessary steps in reasoning. But where are the facts of this descrip∣tion, which prove that some diseases arise from what has been called, by Brown, a state of ex∣cessive excitement, and, by others, a state of plethora? If they can be produced, I will with much readiness acknowledge my error, in having denied the existence of such a state. Un∣til that happens, however, there is no good rea∣son why it should be taken for granted, upon mere <HI>ipse dixit.</HI> As in medicine, much useless
<PB N="139" REF="033254_0131_0ff6a8f8bb903ec8"/>
controversy might have been avoided, by attend∣ing to accuracy of expression, it may not be im∣proper to explain the sense, in which the term "excessive excitement" is here understood. Excitement is meant to express the vigor, with which the functions of life are performed, in all their different degrees. But the functions of life can only be performed in a due, or in a defici∣ent degeee. To say that they can be performed in an <HI>excessive</HI> degree, is as great a contradicti∣on in terms, as <HI>excessive virtue,</HI> or <HI>excessive joy</HI>; the one is <HI>vice,</HI> the other <HI>pain.</HI> When stimulant powers are applied in due proportion, the ex∣citement is at the degree which constitutes vi∣gor, tone, or health. But when they are ap∣plied, either in a deficient or an excessive de∣gree, the power with which the functions of life are performed, i. e. the <HI>excitement</HI> is diminished. That power consists in a pleasant, easy, and ex∣act use of these functions; which is certain∣ly not enjoyed in the diseases, that have been referred to a state of excessive excitement. When a degree of stimulant power, higher than is ne∣cessary to the state of health, is applied, the func∣tions of life will be performed with more than u∣sual vigor, before they fall into a state of indirect debility; but never with <HI>excessive</HI> vigor. The <HI>action</HI> of the fibre may be excessive, but its <HI>power</HI> cannot.—If we trace the progress of the living
<PB N="140" REF="033254_0132_0ff6a8fb4e6fcd00"/>
functions, in a person exposed to the action of high stimulant powers, it will be found, that their vigor is first increased to the highest point, and afterwards diminished in a degree proporti∣onate to the excess. But if these powers be gradually subducted, that diminution will not take place; or if they be re-applied, it will be removed; unless the excess has been such as to occasion the destruction of organs. It will not, I believe, be denied, that the headach, sickness, &amp;c. which arise after excessive drinking, consti∣tute a state of indirect debility, which might have been prevented by the gradual subduction, and is to be removed by the re-application of stimu∣lant powers. That a certain quantity of spirits, a ride, &amp;c. will remove these symptoms, is a fact that is known, almost to every one. After excessive walking, or dancing, that state of in∣direct debility constituting fatigue, is not imme∣diately induced. It becomes more severe the second and third day, unless, by a certain degree of walking, or dancing, or the substitution of other stimuli, in the intermediate time, it be prevented. After such an excess, rest is exceed∣ingly injurious.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dean Swift's mode of taking exercise, but in somewhat lower degree, was good. The regulation of exercise and the passions, is at present almost totally neglected, in the cure of diseases. They are subjects which seem to be yet but little understood, although their importance to health and to morals are evidently great.</NOTE>—It is equally true, that the de∣lirium,
<PB N="141" REF="033254_0133_0ff6a90613f01488"/>
fever, &amp;c. which arise from excessive exposure to the sun, from opium, aether, mer∣cury, or any other stimulant power, applied in too high a degree, depend upon indirect debi∣lity; and that they may be prevented by a grad∣ual reduction, or cured by a proper re-applicati∣on of the same powers, or of others equivalent in force. None of these symptoms occur, during the action of the exciting powers; they always commence after these powers have been with∣drawn. If this be denied, it must be supposed, that medicines lie dormant in the body for some hours, after having been taken; and then, all at once, begin to act. But headach does not in∣stantaneously follow the application of spirituous liquors; delirium, or fever, the application of opium, or the solar rays; vomiting, the application of tartar emetic; salivation, the use of mercury; purging, the exhibition of cathartics; sweat, of sudorifics; nor vesication, the application of a blister, or of sire, to the skin.—On the contra∣ry, these symptoms always appear somtime after the application of the exciting powers; and may be prevented by a gradual reduction, or cured by a judicious re-application of the same powers, or
<PB N="142" REF="033254_0134_0ff6a809c6ce5af8"/>
of others equivalent in force; excepting, indeed, when the force of the noxious power has been so great, as to produce an immediate lesion of or∣gans. Let us take a familiar case, as an exam∣ple. Suppose an arm, or a leg has been exposed to the action of fire, no person, in his right sen∣ses, would think of plunging it into cold water, or snow, or applying ice. It is a fact well known, that ardent spirits, vinegar, and other stimuli of high degree, are the proper remedies; and that, if applied in due time, and in sufficient quantity, they will prevent the inflammation, vesication, pain, and fever that would otherwise ensue. If the principle be established, in one case of exces∣sive application of stimuli, it must equally apply to all. Every fact concurs in proving, that the bad symptoms which arise after an excessive application of the stimulant powers already men∣tioned, or of others, depend upon a state of in∣direct debility, <HI>not</HI> upon such a state as that of excessive excitement; and that they are to be prevented or removed by the proper application, <HI>not</HI> by the subduction of stimulant powers.</P>
<P>IF, to a person in health, a very high degree of heat has been applied, as in exposure to the rays of a burning sun, would it not be as danger∣ous to remove him suddenly into a cool, or even a temperate atmosphere, as it would, in the case
<PB N="143" REF="033254_0135_0ff6a908b16bee88"/>
of a person, who had been exposed to a high de∣gree of cold. In the one case the fact is uni∣versally admitted, and the principle applied to practice: Why not in the other? Is it more difficult to comprehend that, after an application of extraordinary stimuli, a sudden subduction of them should produce indirect debility, than that the same effect should follow a sudden re-applica∣tion of the ordinary stimuli, after they have been for any time withheld?—Upon principles equally clear, the excitability in the one case, would not be accumulated; in the other, it would be exhaus∣ted. Hence it is evident, why cases of <HI>coup de soleil</HI> are so frequently fatal. I should think my∣self acting with equal propriety, in suddenly subducting, not only the high stimulant power of the solar rays, after having been for some time applied, (at least without substituting ano∣ther stimulus nearly as powerful, and then gra∣dually reducing it) but farther taking away a quantity of blood, and diminishing all the ordi∣nary stimuli, as in plunging legs nearly frozen into hot water, giving a pound of meat to one who had been long fasting, and farther apply∣ing, to persons, in these states, opium, aether, or brandy. It is much to be regretted that, in this, as well as in many other cases, practitioners who are not themselves convinced of the efficacy of blood-letting, should think it incumbent up∣on
<PB N="144" REF="033254_0136_0ff6a90ad15c2720"/>
them, from a false desire of reputation, or a regard to interest, to put it so frequently in practice. It is very true, that a conformity with the common practice is safest in a prudential view. For, if a patient dies of peripneumony, without the formalities of bleeding and purging, he will be said to have lost his life, in consequence of these omissions. But if he dies, after they have been duly performed, it is only from the necessity of his fate.</P>
<P>PERIPNEUMONY, in reality, is seldom a dan∣gerous disease, until, by blood-letting and other debilitating means, inflammation and adhesion of membranes, suppuration, and dropsy are pro∣duced.—Has a person ever died in a state of ex∣cessive vigour? No, nor ever will. No danger, then, need be apprehended from such a state.</P>
<P>IF it be a certain fact that opium, judiciously repeated, will prevent or cure those very symp∣toms, which an unskilful application of it may have produced; if, by the proper exhibition of mercury, that medicine may be given, not only without producing salivation, but so as to cure it; if the sickness and headachs that occur, after excessive drinking, may not only be preven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed by a gradual diminution of the excess, but may be cured by the application of a certain degree of the same power. If, I say, all these be facts (and
<PB N="145" REF="033254_0137_0ff6a9102c250a68"/>
they will be found so by those who will give them a fair trial) the inevitable conclusion is, that all the diseases in question, depend upon a state of exhaustion or of indirect debility, and are to be cured, by the application of stimulant powers, in a degree proportionate to the exhaustion.</P>
<P>FROM the general ignorance and neglect of this doctrine, the best adapted of these powers, to particular cases and degrees of disease, have not yet been well ascertained. But in proporti∣on as it is more generally received, physicians, instead of random empirical prescriptions, will apply powers to living bodies, according to known principles, and with a view to particu∣lar effects. They will consider the living body as a whole, upon the state of which depends that of every particular part; and they will de∣sist from the hopeless task of prescribing for strangling symptoms. They will co-operate in discovering the relative powers, the duration of their action, and the best method of exhibiting, every substance that can be employed in medi∣cine. While, in diseases of the highest degree, they will all probably employ the most diffusible stimuli, as opium, aether, camphor, volatile al∣kali, mercury, &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The powers of arsenic and other substances called poisons, are by no means well ascertained. But we have implements enough, if we knew how to use them.</NOTE>; in the lower degrees, each
<PB N="146" REF="033254_0138_0ff6a913afbd4c58"/>
may with advantage give a preference to his fa∣vourite medicine. And if he applies it, so as to support the excitement, health will be re-produc∣ed, whether he uses bark, or wine, salts, aloes, or gamboge; castor oil, rhubarb, or cream of tartar.</P>
<P>NOTHING perhaps has contributed more to increase the confusion in medical doctrines, than the inaccurate language and loose reasoning, with which the cultivators of the art have found it necessary to veil the absurdities of their sys∣tems. The division of causes into proximate and remote, is a remarkable instance of this. It shews evidently that, in medical reasoning, POWER has uniformly been confounded with CAUSE. Many powers may combine to produce one effect; but it is not any one of these powers, but the sum of the whole, that constitutes the <HI>cause</HI> of that <HI>effect.</HI> Thus, excessive heat,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is always to be understood, that excessive heat, or other stimuli applied in excess, relates to the state of the ex∣citability, not to any particular standard of heat, or any degree of other stimulant powers.</NOTE> fa∣tigue, bad news, noxious air, may all combine to produce a state of indirect debility. The cause of this state of indirect debility, is <HI>not</HI> excessive heat, fatigue, bad news, or noxious air; <HI>but</HI>
<PB N="147" REF="033254_0139_0ff6a9159931dc10"/>
the sum of all these powers. Again, indirect debility, in its various degrees, is the cause of all those symptoms which constitute diseases, depending upon that state, each of which has, in nosological systems, obtained a particular name. But, as there can be nothing intermedi∣ate between a cause and its effect, and as there can only be required one cause to produce one effect, <HI>remote cause</HI> is evidently a gross contra∣diction in terms. To say that any of the powers, the application of which will produce a state of indirect debility, is a <HI>cause</HI> of symptoms, which are <HI>consequences</HI> of that state, appears to me as great a perversion of reasoning, as it would be to affirm, that a man dies <HI>because</HI> he has been begotten. The one event undoubtedly precedes the other; but they are not in the relation of cause and effect, as these terms are generally un∣derstood.</P>
<P>ANOTHER circumstance, which has contri∣buted to prolong the public delusion, in respect to the uncertainty of medical principles is this. THEORY and HYPOTHESIS, I hope and believe more through ignorance than design, have been very generally confounded under the common name of OPINION; as if it were impossible, that principles should exist, because they have not been discovered by system makers; that, as all
<PB N="148" REF="033254_0140_0ff6a80f012fb9e8"/>
medical systems which have hitherto been framed are erroneous, there cannot be a true one in na∣ture; or that man alone is that curious composi∣tion, that "fortuitous concourse of atoms," which nature, in a frolicksome mood, had ex∣empted from the operation of laws, fixed, im∣mutable, eternal.—It will be difficult, without the aid of inspiration, to reconcile assertions of successful practice, with a confession that it is founded upon conjecture. It will be equally dif∣ficult to account, with decency, for an oppo∣sition to a doctrine, of which the fundamental propositions are either self-evident facts, or in∣ductions from numerous facts; of which every proposition has an evident relation to every other, and the whole to every part. It might rather be supposed that the contention would be, who should apply the principles most correctly to practice.</P>
<P>TO the ridiculous and vague objections, found∣ed on the alledged danger of giving large doses of medicines, the following remarks, it is pre∣sumed, will be a sufficient reply. From the principles of the foregoing doctrine, it results that, in every disease, a sum of stimulant power equal, or nearly equal, to that which has pro∣duced the disease, must be applied, in order to effect a cure. It is only when the sum of the
<PB N="149" REF="033254_0141_0ff6a91837059a10"/>
powers so applied exceed that, which has produc∣ed the disease, that the medicines can do harm. In that case, and in that case only, they will produce a disease more dangerous, because high∣er in degree, than that which had previously ex∣isted. Hence it appears that, while in diseases of the highest degree, as plague, dysentery, and fevers, more especially in those cases in which organic lesion has taken place, the common dos∣es of medicines is merely sporting with lives, in diseases, deviating but little from health, they, for the most part, exceed the just proportion. While, in some cases of the former, from four to five hundred drops of tincture of opium will be too little, in some cases of the latter, the usu∣al quantity of from twenty to thirty drops, will be too much. Indeed in cases, deviating but lit∣tle from health, those high stimulant powers are unnecessary, and ought not to be used. These conclusions will appear so evident, to all who understand the principles of the new doctrine, that it would be superfluous, and might seem im∣pertinent, to dwell longer on that subject.</P>
<P>IN like manner, it is evident whence the disputes, which have arisen among physicians, respecting the virtues of particular medicines, have derived their source. From want of just principles as a guide, the same power which proved useful
<PB N="150" REF="033254_0142_0ff6a91a1648c1f8"/>
in the hands of one man, from a particular mode of application, has been found injurious by o∣thers, from a different mode of exhibiting it. Hence the virtues of the peruvian bark, since its first discovery, have been extravagantly ex∣tolled, and as unreasonably decried. Hence hemlock, which was so successfully used by the judicious Dr. Stork, entirely failed with other practitioners, and unjustly lost its reputatation. Hence electricity, which, applied according to principle, I will venture to affirm, will be found a power of superior efficacy in the cure of diseas∣es, has been greatly neglected; and when suc∣cessful, has only been so by chance.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have some opinions regarding electricity, as applied to living bodies, which I shall take an early opportunity of verifying, or disproving by experiment. If they prove true, it will throw much light on the principles of the doctrine.</NOTE> And hence, more recently still, the inconclusive dis∣putes concerning the effects of opium, and other substances of high stimulant power, applied to living bodies.</P>
<P>ONE of the most egregious mistakes which has been made, respecting the doctrine of life, re∣mains still to be mentioned. It has been under∣stood, or rather misunderstood, to consist entire∣ly in the exhibition of opium, brandy, and wine,
<PB N="151" REF="033254_0143_0ff6a9216498aed0"/>
in every case, and with no discrimination▪ To those who know it better, it must appear evident, that these substances have no more relation to the principles of the doctrine, than any other pow∣ers, that may be applied to the excitability. The free use of them, in a state of health, is even contrary to principle. But the laws of nature, as they respect living bodies, would seem, in the ordinary routine of custom, to have been nearly reversed. In a state of health, for the most part, too great a sum of stimulant power is applied; in a state of disease, generally too little. Suppose opium, brandy, and wine annihilated, the doctrine would remain entire. Provided the excitement be supported, it matters not by what powers it is done. It is evident, then, that those, who have rested their opposition upon objections to any particu∣lar medicine, or the doses of medicines, could not have understood the subject. Indeed to un∣derstand is to believe in it. As soon will eyes, in a sound state, be unable to distinguish light from darkness, as a mind capable of comprehend∣ing the terms, can disbelieve the fundametal pro∣positions of the doctrine of life. If this be true, can it be denied, that the doctrine has, by all its opponents, been either prejudged or mis∣understood?</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="033254_0144_0ff6a9248637e758"/>THIS is not a question of party; but a contest between truth and error. It is not the judgment, dignity, or character of this or that individual, that is in dispute; but the truth or falshood of a doctrine, whose principles embrace every part of animated nature. Whether discoveries have been made by a man named Brown, or a man named Cullen; whether they have issued from the obscurity of a cottage, or the elevated desk of a professor, is of little consequence to the world. But it is of essential importance, that they should know the nature and extent of the discoveries. It is high time to bring the question to an issue. If the doctrine be true, it behoves those, who consider themselves as <HI>multis experimentis eruditi,</HI> avowedly to embrace it; if false, they should, by reasoning, or a comparative trial, undeceive the rising generation, whose minds are rapidly re∣ceiving the infection.</P>

<HEAD>A TREATISE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN enquiring into the action of mercu∣ry upon living bodies, no attempt will be made to investigate its <HI>modus operandi,</HI> of which we are totally ignorant. It is the effects, whether salutary or noxious, that succeed the application of that power to living bodies, which will form the subject of consideration.</P>
<P>WHATEVER be the mode in which mercury acts, like every substance in nature, it can pro∣duce no other effect upon living bodies, than to increase or diminish the power, with which they perform their proper functions;—in other words, to increase or diminish their excitement. All the substances in nature, which are capable, when applied to living bodies, of increasing or diminish∣ing their excitement, are denominated stimulant or exciting powers. Should it, then, appear
<PB N="156" REF="033254_0148_0ff6a9332f82f6c0"/>
that mercury will increase or diminish the excite∣ment,—that it will both produce and cure diseas∣es of indirect debility,—may we not, nay, must we not conclude that it is a stimulant or exciting power?</P>
<P>THIS theory I had adopted in 1789; since which period, I have applied it to practice, in ma∣ny cases, and with considerable success. The first trial was made upon myself. In January, 1789, on the passage from Bengal to England, having been seized with a quotidian intermittent fever, tartar emetic, and afterwards bark, with now and then a cathartic medicine, were, as usual, exhibited. Under this mode of treatment, I daily became weaker, and in the course of three weeks, during which the same plan was persisted in, my legs became aedematous, the paroxysms of fever more severe, and I could, with difficulty rise out of bed.</P>
<P>THE <HI>evacuant</HI> and <HI>antiseptic</HI> plans were now entirely abandoned; and between two and three drachms of mercurial ointment, were rubbed up∣on my body, at bed time. The alteration, which this single rubbing produced, was equally unex∣pected and salutary. I slept the whole night; and in the morning, awoke in a gentle perspirati∣on, without fever, or pain, any disagreeable symptoms, excepting aedema and general debility,
<PB N="157" REF="033254_0149_0ff6a934e70b48f8"/>
remaining. The ointment was rubbed in, three or four times; and I had no return of fever. My mouth was not affected; and I speedily got well. The issue of this experiment made a deep impression on my mind, and determined me, in future, to use mercury, in every case of inter∣mittent fever. Having obtained a slight know∣ledge of the Brunonian doctrine, I thought my∣self in the state of the benighted traveller, to whom Brown, with so much justice and elegance, compared himself, upon the first discovery of his doctrine. ***
<Q>veluti viatori, ignotâ re∣gione, perditis viae vestigiis, in umbrâ nocti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> erranti, perobscura quoedam, quasi prima diur∣na, lux demum adfulsit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Elementa Medicinae.</NOTE>.</Q>
I inferred that mercury, in common with <HI>many</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>All,</HI> according to the present ideas.</NOTE> other medicines, was a stimulant power; and would, therefore, be useful in all diseases of indirect debility. As, according to the same principles, it appeared that other fevers differed from intermittents, only in degree; and as mercury was found a certain cure for intermittents; I thence concluded that fevers, whatever their nosological distinctions, were the proper cases, by which to subject the theory to farther proof. One of the first instances, in which an opportunity of trying the practice in other
<PB N="158" REF="033254_0150_0ff6a93a152281d8"/>
fevers occurred, was the following.—Having made a voyage to Jamaica, in the interval of two voyages to Bengal, I was, early in 1790, on a visit to my friend, Dr. Hector Maclean, of Rus∣sel Hall, in the parish of St. Mary's. During my residence there, an European book-keeper upon the plantation, by name—Macmillan, was seiz∣ed with typhus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is almost unnecessary to observe that nosological distinc∣tions are totally disregarded, as incompatible with the princi∣ples of the new doctrine. Generic names are, for conveni∣ence, sometimes retained.</NOTE>, or the common yellow fever of that country. When I first saw him, he was comatose and picking the bed cloathes; he had got some purges, and had been taking bark. His pulse was quick and small; his tongue black and furred; and he was supposed beyond the possibi∣bility of recovery. I represented to Dr. Maclean the good effects produced by mercury, in other cases of fever, and requested that he would permit it to be tried in this; to which, with a liberality, not always to be met with from established practitioners, he readily consented<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This gentleman had been a practitioner of reputation. But had then retired from the exercise of his profession, and resided on his estate.</NOTE>. About an ounce of strong mercurial ointment was immediatly rubbed on the patient's body.
<PB N="159" REF="033254_0151_0ff6a93d61b55d30"/>
But, as in typhus, this was a new experiment, I did not choose wholly to trust to the mercury; and therefore desired that he might be allowed a wine glassful of Madeira every hour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is but a small quantity of wine in typhus fever.— In some cases it may be necessary to give three or four bottles, in the twenty-four hours. In others, wine, in any quantity, is not sufficiently powerful. Recourse must then be had to the more diffusible stimuli.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE next day he was still insensible; but sat up in bed, and searched, as it were instinctively, for the Madeira bottle. When it was given him, he would not consent to part with it; but held it firm, between both hands, as if something, upon which depended his existence. The oint∣ment was again rubbed in, by guess, twice in the day,—the quantity about half an ounce each time; and the wine was continued. He was perceptibly getting better. The same treat∣ment was persevered in; and at the end of five days, from the commencement of it, he walked in the verandah, in a state of convalescence. It was sometime, however, before he entirely lost the fatuitous look, which has been noticed as a syptom of yellow fever. His face was a little swelled, and his gums slightly affected by the mercury. During convalescence, he took wine and bark freely.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="033254_0152_0ff6a93f57e62de8"/>This recovery, although it appeared surprising, was still only regarded as accidental. The idea of using mercury in fevers was treated, by the generality of medical men, as an extravagant chi∣mera; or, at best, a mere ebullition of Bruno∣nianism, which they had learnt, at school, to con∣sider as heretical.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From this it may be inferred, how well the doctrine has been understood, by those who have pretended to sit in judg∣ment on it. The use of mercury as a stimulant power, results as an obvious inference from the medical principles of Brown. But not more so than tartar emetic, or salts. He did not perceive these inferences himself: from whence it will appear, that, instead of pushing the consequences of his doctrine too far, he did not extend them far enough.</NOTE> But these rebuffs by no means discouraged me from prosecuting my researches, as will appear from the following remarks, ex∣tracted from a medical journal, which I kept in the year 1790:</P>
<P><Q>MERCURY is universally allowed to cure lues venerea. All writers on hepatitis concur, in ex∣tolling its virtues in that disease. I have ex∣perienced its efficacy repeatedly in intermittent fevers, once in typhus, twice in gout, and once in bleeding discharges. A case is related in the London Medical Journal of 1786, (page 413) of obstructed menses, cured by calomel. Af∣fections produced in irritable habits, by the transplantation of teeth, have also been cured
<PB N="161" REF="033254_0153_0ff6a9421a8ce3e8"/>
by mercury; and hence, these diseases have, in my opinion, very erroneously been supposed venereal.</Q></P>
<P>THIS conclusion, which is certainly not just, must have been productive of the most disagreea∣ble consequences. The very idea would severely wound the feelings of delicate and modest females; among whom diseases, from the transplantation of teeth, have most frequently arisen. Besides the injury to the constitution, from an excessive use of mercury, supposing the disease to be venereal. In that disease, mercury is usually given, in much lar∣ger quantities than is necessary, and very seldom in such a manner, as to produce the best pos∣sible effects. In fact, ulcerations produced by the improper exhibition of mercury, may be cured by such an application of the same power, as to support the general excitement.—The same jour∣nal proceeds thus:</P>
<P><Q>At it must be allowed that mercury, like ev∣ery other pow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, can have but one uniform operation upon living bodies, it may fairly be concluded, that all the diseases, which it cures, are of the same kind. And as some of these are certainly diseases of debility, the rest must be diseases of debility also<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This proposition, although of easy comprehension, does not seem to be generally understood. It means that all diseas∣es, which can be cured by the same powers, must depend up∣on a similar state of the body, by whatever powers that state may have been produced. Thus the matter of small-pox, and the powers which produce dysentery, and typhus, must occa∣sion a similar state of the body, differing only in degree; for they are all cured by the application of the same powers, dif∣fering only in degree.</NOTE>. I infer therefore,
<PB N="162" REF="033254_0154_0ff6a945f9330160"/>
with as much confidence as analogical reasoning can justify, that mercury is useful, in every dis∣ease of debility <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It should have been <HI>indirect</HI> debility. These observa∣tions were originally written for my own amusement, without any intention of publishing.</NOTE>. But I would not be under∣stood to prefer it in every case, nor totally to rely upon it in any. For, even in lues venerea, where it is generally a certain cure, it often requires the aid of other stimuli, par∣ticularly opium, wine, and bark; or to be al∣ternated with them, when from habit, it begins to lose its effect.</Q></P>
<P>THE following case, extracted from the same journal, is the instance alluded to of gout and bleeding discharges, being cured by mercury.</P>
<P><Q>MRS. E— B—, of Kingston, Jamaica, aged forty years, had been accustomed to live freely, and was subject to frequent attacks of gout. Having been occasionally at her house, she sometimes asked my advice. In the course of a short space of time (for she was subject
<PB N="163" REF="033254_0155_0ff6a94b88224a68"/>
to frequent paroxysms) she was cured of two attacks of gout, by mercury, opium, and the warm bath; but mercury was the principal power applied. On the 8th of August, 1790, she complained of an incessant menstrual dis∣charge, alternating with a discharge of blood from the piles. These symptoms she said had commenced seven weeks before, occasioned, as she thought, by fear; and, for some days, had been accompanied with headach, pain of back, loins, and other feverish sensations.— Her stomach was very irritable, and could bear nothing liquid in the morning, excepting wa∣ter, accidulated with elixir of vitriol, or ginger tea. She had a troublesome cough, and pain in her side, which she supposed to arise from the affection of the liver. This idea she was rather encouraged to entertain, that an op∣portunity might be got of trying the effects of mercury, in bleeding discharges. Two drachms of mercurial ointment were rubbed on her body in the evening, and she was de∣sired to take a draught, with forty drops of tincture of opium, every four hours, through the night. Her legs were immersed in warm water. She was advised to take solid food only; and to use for drink, water strongly accidulated with elixir of vitriol, or ginger tea. August the 9th, the ointment and lau∣danum
<PB N="164" REF="033254_0156_0ff6a972d4439388"/>
had been used as directed. She had no fever; her headach was less severe; and she perspired freely. The menses ceased to flow, and discharge commenced from the piles. She was still encouraged to believe that her liver was affected; and the medicines were ordered to be continued. August the 10th, she was in all respects better. The discharge from the piles was considerably less.—One drachm of ointment only was rubbed in, and the tincture of opium was omitted. 11th, the ointment was once more rubbed in. The dis∣charge from the piles entirely ceased; and she had no return of any of her symptoms.</Q></P>
<P>THOSE who are inclined to question the effi∣cacy of mercury, in diseases of indirect debility, may object that, as other powers were, in this case, combined with it, the cure cannot fairly be attributed to the mercury alone. That is very true. All the other powers performed their re∣spective parts. But, from a thousand analogies, I think it may be affirmed, that mercury alone would have been sufficient. In general, when several powers can be applied to different parts of the body, either in concourse or succession, so as to support the excitement regularly, and with equality, it is much better to have recourse to many, than to trust entirely to one.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="033254_0157_0ff6aa069c749f48"/>THE effects of mercury, in fevers and other diseases of indirect debility, were mentioned in conversation with medical men, in many parts of the Island of Jamaica; most of which I visited in 1789-90. The idea, as usually happens, was endeavoured to be ridiculed, and the facts to be discredited. It has since that period, however, come into general practice in Jamaica, the other West-India Islands, and in America, as appears from Dr. Duncan's Medical Commentaries, for 1795<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 348 to 354.</NOTE>. By this history, it is not intended to claim any more merit for the introduction of that practice, than each reader may be disposed to allow. Provided the facts be admitted, the origin and progress of the discovery is of little consequence. As the practice, in so far as it is good, is but a mere application of the principles of Brown, the whole merit of it is, in my opini∣on, justly and solely due to the doctrine of that most ingenious physician.</P>
<P>THE following extracts, from the Medical Journal of the English East-India Company's ship Northumberland, in the years 1791 and 1792, will farther shew the manner, in which the application of mercury, upon the same prin∣ciples, was extended to diseases, in which it had never, to my knowledge, been used before.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="033254_0158_0ff6aa0aa16d82a8"/><Q>JOHN HURST's case<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A case of intermittent. The observations refer to par∣ticular cases in the journal.</NOTE>, is a proof of what I have experienced on several occasions, and first of all tried upon myself,—the efficacy of mercury in intermittent fevers. In all the cases (not less than ten or twelve) in which the experiment was fairly made, I have not known it to fail once, where the mercurial ointment was used in such quantity as to affect the mouth. The soreness of the mouth, seems to be a sign, that the system is sufficient∣ly excited, to overcome diseases of debility<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This is incorrect. The soreness of the mouth arises from a state of indirect debility, in consequence of the sudden sub∣duction, or irregular application of mercury.</NOTE>. A man in health, or in a state of high vigor, is much sooner affected, than a person in a low, languid condition. In the case of John Hurst<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Intermittent—</NOTE>, William Smith<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Jaundice—</NOTE>, — Cummins<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ophthalmy—</NOTE>, and Paul Harris<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Hectic fe∣ver—These patients were prescribed for, without any other rule, than to rub in a certain portion of mercurial ointment daily, until the disease should cease, or the mouth become affected. But this as I have since found, is not a proper mode of exhibiting mercury. As it was not supposed to act in any <HI>specific</HI> manner, its operation was supported by opium, camphor, wine, bark, the warm bath, and blisters, according to circumstances. The principles, however, were not always correctly applied. Nor does it seem to be any valid objecti∣on, that a knowledge of their application is not to be acquired by intuitively.</NOTE>, the quantity of mercury
<PB N="167" REF="033254_0159_0ff6aa111aa12380"/>
used before salivation was produced, seemed to be inversely as their vigour. This propo∣sition is farther confirmed by a fact well known to practitioners—that by premising blood-let∣ting, more opium or mercury may be <HI>safely</HI> thrown into the system.</Q></P>
<P>ALTHOUGH it is rather deviating from the subject, it is worth while to pause a moment in admiration of the rule of practice, founded upon this fact. First, to draw blood, to have after∣wards the pleasure of introducing more opium, or mercury into the system, than could other∣wise have been done; to debilitate, in order to strengthen; to accommodate the patient's habit to the quantity of medicine that is to be given, rather than proportion the quantity of medicine to the state of the patient; these are rules so wonderfully sublime, that they can never be sufficiently admired! If it were permitted, upon such subjects, to reason in a plain way, I would ask, if a patient's excitement be five degrees be∣low the healthy standard, how can any rational being think of lowering it five degrees more,
<PB N="168" REF="033254_0160_0ff6aa13d38066b0"/>
that he may afterwards raise it, with the greater safety? He will then require to apply double the force, that would at first have been sufficient. The Journal goes on to observe, that
<Q>mercury affects the mouth much sooner, when opium, blisters, the warm bath, or any other of the more powerful stimuli are used at the same time. In the case of Willian Kirk, the addi∣tional stimulus of the warm bath speedily ac∣complished what opium, mercury, and wine did not effect for a fortnight.</Q></P>
<P>THIS patient had the usual symptoms of chro∣nic diarrhoea, with a considerable degree of hec∣tic fever, emaciation, and entire loss of appe∣tite. Externally he used mercury, and internally opium and wine, according to circumstances. It was found necessary to alternate these stimuli with others, such as blisters and the warm bath. He used to remain a quarter of an hour in the bath, heated to as great a degree as he could easily bear. It was not tried, until after he had been a fortnight using mercury. After having used it twice, his mouth became sore. There was an increased flow of saliva, and he recovered in a very short space of time, to the great sur∣prise of all who saw him; and, I confess, contrary to my own expectations. It now, however, ap∣pears, as a case of disease, by no means danger∣ous, if treated in a manner, but distantly ap∣proaching
<PB N="169" REF="033254_0161_0ff6a969d6a8d3b8"/>
to the exactness of scientific princi∣ples. The following remarks are in prosecution of the same subject:—
<Q>In June, 1791, we had from thirty to forty soldiers, ill of fevers, catarrhs, and rheumatisms, and many more with various trifling ailments▪ whose cases were not entered in the Journal. The similarity of their diseases and treatment, rendered it unnecessary to record any, excepting the most dangerous. In every case in which mercury was given, so as to produce salivation, the pulse rose, and all complaints gave way, as soon as the mouth was thoroughly affected. But in some cases, that was found very diffi∣cult to accomplish; and in others, I was afraid, although perhaps without just grounds, to push the medicine to a great extent, particularly in diarrhoea and dysentery.</Q></P>
<P>THIS groundless apprehension, arose from a knowledge of the purging effects that succeeded the use of calomel, and other mercurial prepa∣rations; and from erroneously supposing that a medicine, which, exhibited in one way, produ∣ces purging, cannot, if exhibited in another way, cure diseases, of which purging is the principal symptom. But farther reflection and experi∣ence, soon banished this remnant of scholastic prejudice.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="033254_0162_0ff6a96ca0ebc3d0"/>I SHALL give one extract more, from the ob∣servations upon this subject, made on board the Northumberland, in April, 1792.
<Q>In every case of low fever, which occurred among the soldiers, on the passage to India, from the mo∣ment the mouth was effected<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By affection of the mouth, is meant an increased flow of saliva. When a free and increased flow of saliva takes place, such as constitutes salivation, a reeovery will always ensue, if the succeeding treatment be right. But the mouth, gums, fauces, and tongue may be ulcerated, without an increased flow of saliva being produced. In those cases, many facts au∣thorise the conclusion, that no recovery will take place. In∣ternal locai disease, of the thoracic or abdominal viscera, or both, will be found upon dissection. These appearances have been so uniform, in many cases which I have opened, that I can now venture nearly to predict, in what state the visce∣ra will be found, where the mouth cannot be affected, so as to produce an increased flow of saliva.</NOTE>, a recovery commenced. But as the mercury was used externally only; and as, in some cases, the mouth could not, in that manner, be affected (which cases never terminated favourably) might not the internal use of that medicine prove more effectual? And would it not be ad∣viseable to exhibit it, in small doses, frequently repeated, until the desired effect is produced?</Q></P>
<P>As the foregoing observations were not ori∣ginally designed for publication, it was found
<PB N="171" REF="033254_0163_0ff6a96f38bf7b28"/>
impossible to copy them literally from the jour∣nal. In many places, therefore, words are alter∣ed to render them less unfit for publication; but no alteration is any where made in the sense. The journal, from which they are extracted, was ex∣amined by the English East India Company's physician, in August or September, 1792, and afterwards deposited in their warehouse.</P>
<P>From that period, my confidence in the pow∣ers of mercury, for the cure of all diseases of in∣direct debility, became so decided, that I determi∣ned to apply it in every case, in which the ideas of my patients would admit of the practice,—even in diarrhoeas, and dysentery, the diseases in which the theory seemed most difficult of reconciliation. With respect to the diseases that were considered as depending upon a state of excessive excitement, although I much doubted the existence of such a state, yet my ideas were by no means sufficiently clear in regard to it. An opportunity having soon occurred of putting it to the test of expe∣riment, in my own person, it was eagerly em∣braced. In September, 1793, after having been exposed a whole day to the heat of the sun, in an open boat, upon the river Hooghly, I was seized, in the evening, with symptoms of high fever. According to the common practice, I should immediately have lost blood, taken an emetic, or purgative, and abstracted as far as
<PB N="172" REF="033254_0164_0ff66b6b208fe060"/>
possible, all the usual and ordinary stimuli. Instead of that, a pill, consisting of one grain of opium and one grain of calomel, was taken every hour, through the night. By this means, the excitement was sufficiently supported, and I remained easy, with an abatement of all the fe∣brile symptoms. On the following morning, a considerable stiffness, swelling, and pain, affected my left arm, from the shoulder downwards; and it had assumed a kind of livid appearance, rather alarming. This arm, from the situation in which I stood in the boat, had been more exposed to the direct rays of the sun, than any other part of my body. It was bathed with tincture of opi∣um, and rubbed with mercurial ointment alter∣nately; and the pills were continued. After having taken about thirty pills, my arm began to return to its usual state, and all the other symptoms disappeared. The pills were omitted; and I found myself quite well.—From eight to twelve hours, however, after the pills were omitted, my mouth, all at once, became very sore. A discharge of blood from the fauces and gums soon commenced, which continued trou∣blesome for two days, and ended in salivation. Had I then adverted to the fact, that a sore mouth and salivation are not produced by a re∣gular exhibition of mercury, but by the irregular exhibition, or sudden subduction of it, these
<PB N="173" REF="033254_0165_0ff66b6fdae2cc18"/>
troublesome and disagreeable symptoms might easily have been avoided; or if, by neglect, they had been allowed to occur, they might as readi∣ly have been cured. The fever did not return; and I was soon restored to health. This fever, after a bleeding or two, would most probably have assumed the appearance of peripneumony, which, according to the medical hypotheses of the schools, would have indicated still farther bleeding, and other evacuations. And there is little doubt that, under such treatment, it would have terminated, at the best, as so many cases of acute diseases do, in this country,—in adhe∣sions of membranes, local affections of the vis∣cera, or a very lingering recovery<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In consequence of a conversation that took place, after writing this treatise, the following note, extracted from the 9th vol. of the Edinburgh Medical Commentaries, was sent me,
<Q>Dr. Robert Hamilton, of Lynne Regis, on eighteen years experience, recommends mercury, joined with opium, in inflammation of the liver, peripneumony (even in women far advanced in pregnancy) inflammatory gout, wounds of the head, thorax, abdomen—from one to five grains of ca∣lomel, and from ¼ to one grain of opium, every six, eight, or twelve hours.</Q>
This most excellent practice was, in all probability, opposed at the time, in order to support some ri∣diculous hypotheses of the Schools.</NOTE>. But let me not be misunderstood. It is the bleeding alone which I condemn in so unqualified a man∣ner. The cathartics, sudorifics, &amp;c. employed
<PB N="174" REF="033254_0166_0ff6a94d45b88dc8"/>
in these diseases, although by no means given with the proper view, and therefore seldom giv∣en in a proper manner, are, upon the whole, productive of more good than harm. Their ef∣fect is always to increase excitement, and the state of indirect debility, which succeeds their operation, constituting purging, sweating, &amp;c. arises from their not being repeated afterwards in such a regular manner, as to produce the highest excitement.</P>
<P>SOON after this period, an opportunity occurr∣ed of giving mercury a very fair trial, in diarr∣hoea and dysentery, almost the only diseases in which I had not yet ventured to apply it. Ear∣ly in the year 1794, I was on board the English East-India Company's ship Houghton, composing part of a squadron on a cruize against the French, and designed for the protection of Batavia. The crew of the Houghton, in consequence of the ship's having been ill manned, some peculiarities in the internal oeconomy, and having been stati∣oned, at the port of Batavia, a month longer than the other ships, suffered much from sick∣ness. A very great proportion of the seamen were seized with diarrhoeas, fevers, and dysen∣teries, the severest that I had ever seen. The European soldiers and lascars<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We had on board a company of European infantry, and a company of gun lascars, from Bengal.</NOTE>, being subject to
<PB N="175" REF="033254_0167_0ff6a97568f4fc40"/>
different regulations, enjoyed a tolerable exemp∣tion from disease. Upon this occasion, the in∣efficacy of the treatment, recommended by au∣thors and teachers, in severe cases of dysentery, struck me in the most forcible manner. The usual doses of medicines produced no percepti∣ble effect. In this dilemma, it was determined, as had been successfully practised upon other oc∣casions,
<Q>to use opium, camphor, mercury and other stimuli, both internally, and externally, until the disease was cured, or a salivation pro∣duced. In every case, in which the mouth was affected, a recovery with certainty ensued<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">But in those cases, in which the mouth could not be affected, so as to produce an increased flow of Saliva, not one recovered. This remark was omitted in the journal, having been supposed to follow as a necessary conclusion from the other. But as, upon a more attentive consideration, that does not appear to be the case, it is proper that both circum∣stances should be explicitly stated. I was sometimes deceiv∣ed by an appearance of soreness of the mouth, and left off the medicine prematurely.</NOTE>. Blisters and wine were used, with great ad∣vantage, as auxiliaries</Q>.
These remarks are taken, with some trifling alteration in the lan∣guage, from a copy of the Medical Journal, kept on board the Houghton, in 1793 and 1794<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">THE Journal itself ought to have been d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>posited, as usual, at the India House. But I am informed, that it has either been mislaid, or, for private reasons, wilfully suppressed, by the commander of the Houghton, on his passage to Europe. A copy of the remarks, however, has been forwarded to the Court of Directors.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="033254_0168_0ff6a950e17ce810"/>THUS it appears, that the efficacy of mercury has been experienced in almost every disease of in∣direct debility. In the East and West Indies, and in America, it has been found a cure for the yel∣low fever of these climates. But it has not been exhibited with the view, or in the manner, in which alone it can produce the best possible effects, viz. so as to support the excitement. Dr. Chish∣olm, indeed, has approached the nearest to the proper mode of exhibiting this medicine, without however seeming to understand the principles. It is more surprising that Dr. Rush, who appears to understand the fundamental principles of the doc∣trine of life, should not have applied them, in the treatment of the yellow fever of Philadelphia. His attributing the cure to the purging operation, which succeeds the use of calomel, shews how dif∣ficult it is to erase early impressions, however erro∣neous, even from the most vigorous mind.</P>
<P>IF opium, wine, and bark failed in cases of yel∣low fever oftener than mercury, as is said to have happened at Philadelphia, it must have arisen from the former having been exhibited in deficient quantities, while the latter was given more freely.
<PB N="177" REF="033254_0169_0ff6a978e14c8170"/>
It will often happen that the prejudices of practi∣tioners, as well as of the multitude, will render the choice of one medicine more eligible than that of another, when there is no difference in other re∣spects. The circumstance of calomel being suc∣ceeded by purging led, by chance, to a proper practice. But I cannot admit, with Dr. Rush, that it was "the triumph of a medical princi∣ple." The disease would have been cured by any mode of treatment capable of supporting the ex∣citement, in such a manner as to admit of an ac∣cumulation of the excitability.</P>
<P>THAT the opinion is erroneous, needs no other proof than this fact, that, in all diseases, a cure will be better effected, when the medicine is re∣peated at such intervals, as not to produce purg∣ing; but to support the excitement in a regular manner. A cure will also be performed, by the external application of mercurial ointment, with∣out producing purging, as well as by the internal exhibition of calomel. Neither is salivation, sweat∣ing, or an increased discharge of urine, necessary to the cure. On the contrary, these symptoms, all of which in their different degrees depend up∣on a state of indirect debility, should, as far as pos∣sible, be prevented. Salivation is, no doubt, an unequivocal proof of the original disease having been removed; for, being itself a disease of indi∣rect
<PB N="178" REF="033254_0170_0ff6a97bd32d0ad8"/>
debility, occasioned by the sudden subduction of mercury, or its repetition at improper intervals, it cannot co-exist with any other disease. Al∣though, therefore, in diseases of very high degree, salivation is so far a desirable symptom; yet as the disease, if not incurable, may be cured with∣out it, it ought as far as practicable, to be avoid∣ed. There are however, two conditions necessary to this. The first is, that the practitioner should know the principles, and the manner in which they are to be applied to practice: the second, that the patient should conform exactly to his directions. When these circumstances happily concur, accor∣ding to any facts that are yet known, there is not a single disease of indirect debility, in which an organic lesion has not taken place, that may not be cured, without producing either purging, or salivation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Two ingenious papers, on the use of nitric acid in the cure of diseases, were, some time ago, published at Bombay, said to be written by Dr. Scot, of that place. Upon peru∣sing them, I was led to institute some experiments with that medicine. For reasons unnecessary to mention, they were not completed. But there were sufficient grounds to infer, that Dr. Scot's statement of its effects was faithful, and not over∣charged. In chronic cases of disease, of every kind, it pro∣duced good effects; and, in several ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, after the nitric acid was laid aside, a very small quantity of calomel was succeeded by salivation. The inference is obvious. It produced an ef∣fect upon the mouth, similar to that which arises from mer∣cury; and, if a considerable degree of salivation seldom en∣sued, in the cases in which I tried it, that probably arose from its not having been given in sufficient quantity.—The ingenious author of the papers alluded to, it is hoped, will find leisure to trace the analogy, between mercury and nitric acid, more in detail; and to give his ideas to the public in a less perishable shape, than a news-paper essay. The discovery is the more entitled to our respect, as it was the result of rea∣soning, not of accident. Perhaps the large quantity of fluid, necessary to dilute the acid, may be an objection, where the less bulky preparations of mercury can be used with more convenience. But it will often be found a pleasant drink: and may, with advantage, be alternated with the preparations of mercury. I usually began by giving from sixty to a hun∣dred and twenty drops, of highly concentrated acid, in a quart of water, in the 24 hours.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="033254_0171_0ff6a952f73e9018"/>ON the contrary, all evacuations, in so far as they exceed the degree that takes place in the heal∣thy state, are symptoms of indirect debility; and ought therefore to be avoided.</P>
<P>FROM the cases annexed to the
<Q>View of the Science of Life,</Q>
and from the preceding ac∣count of the application of mercury for the cure of diseases of indirect debility, as well as from the history of some hundred cases which have
<PB N="180" REF="033254_0172_0ff6a97dc5323ef8"/>
come within my knowledge, I think myself war∣ranted in drawing the following</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="conclusions">
<HEAD>CONCLUSIONS:</HEAD>
<P>I. THAT mercury applied to living bodies, in due proportion, will increase the excitement, and thereby cure diseases of indirect debility, in their various degrees.</P>
<P>II. THAT, applied in an excessive degree, or in an irregular manner, it will induce a state of in∣direct debility, in its various degrees.</P>
<P>III. THAT this state is indicated by ulcerations of the throat, soreness of the mouth, salivation, purging, sweat, an increased flow of urine, some∣times strangury, and costiveness, &amp;c.</P>
<P>IV. THAT in the exhibition of mercury for the cure of diseases, all these symptoms should, as far as possible, be avoided.</P>
<P>V. BUT as in diseases of high degree, in which large quantities of mercury are required, it will for the most part be difficult, and often imprac∣ticable
<PB N="181" REF="033254_0173_0ff6a981057d1720"/>
to conform to prescriptions, with the necessary exactness;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If in the application of mercury, the judgment of the physician, and the punctuality of the patient, should even co∣operate in ensuring a perfect conformity to principle; the intervals of sleep will often be sufficiently long to occasion a sore mouth, an increased flow of saliva, griping, purging, or any of the other symptoms of indirect debility. Few pa∣tients, under a course of mercury, according to the usual mode of exhibiting it, entirely escape these symptoms. But in proportion as the principles and practice here inculcated are better understood, it will be more in the power of practi∣tioners and patients, so to regulate their conduct, as to pre∣vent, for the most part, those disagreeable occurences.</NOTE> it is much safer in such cases, to run the risque of producing these symp∣toms, than to give such an under proportion as not to remove the disease.</P>
<P>VI. THAT the duration of the action of each dose of mercury, upon the living body, appears to be not less than one or more than two hours. This, however, is not considered as a point yet estab∣lished, with sufficient precision.</P>
<P>VII. BUT whatever be the duration of its action, such exactly is the period at which the doses should be successively repeated, so as to support, in a regular manner, the excitement.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="033254_0174_0ff6a983dd5e5f20"/>
VIII. ULCERATIONS of the throat, soreness of the mouth, salivation, purging, strangury, costiveness, &amp;c. arise, <HI>not</HI> from the immediate action of mer∣cury, <HI>but</HI> from its irregular application, or sud∣den subduction<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If any one affects to doubt this fact, let him take one grain of calomel every hour, for twenty or thirty hours, and then stop. He will find that his mouth does not become sore while he is taking the calomel, at regular periods, but some hours after having left it off; that the soreness will continue to increase for some time after having desisted from taking the medicine; and may be diminished, or removed by a proper re-application of the same power.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IX. WHEN, in consequence of an injudicious ap∣plication, or sudden subduction of mercury, these symptoms of indirect debility occur, they may be cured by the same, or other exciting powers, applied in a degree proportionate to the exhausti∣on of the excitability.</P>
<P>X. MERCURY may, upon these principles, be giv∣en in much greater quantity, and with much bet∣ter effect, than could have been done, according to the old mode of exhibiting it; and without producing salivation, or any other symptom of indirect debility.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="033254_0175_0ff6a9886d439db0"/>
XI. AS, in the cure of those high degrees of ex∣haustion, constituting dysentery and fevers, mer∣cury has been found to be one of the most use∣ful medicines; and as plague is a disease, de∣pending also upon a very high state of exhaustion, it is inferred, that mercury will be found pro∣portionally useful, in the cure even of that pes∣tilential and fatal disorder.</P>
<P>XII. EVERY case of disease, in which an increased flow of saliva succeeded the use of mercury, ter∣minated in recovery.</P>
<P>XIII. EVERY case in which ulceration of the gums, fauces, and tongue, or a discharge of blood from these parts took place, without being accompa∣nied or succeeded by an increased flow of saliva, terminated in death.</P>
<P>XIV. IN all the cases, which, under these circum∣stances, terminated fatally, extensive local dis∣ease of the abdominal or thoracic viscera, or both, was found upon dissection<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">IN a word, infinitely the worst in the Calcutta General Hospital, and perhaps in all India, I opened, during the most unhealthy months of the year, the body of every patient that died under my charge. The appearances were recorded on the books of the Hospital. In every case, there was an extensive lesion of some of the primary organs. Several li∣vers weighed each between five and six pounds, and one near∣ly eight. Some of them contained above a pint of thick pus; and that which weighed near eight pounds, contained above a quart. In some cases, cartilaginous, in others boney substances, were found in livers, in which there were no traces of recent suppuration. They seemed to be concretions form∣ed from purulent matter. There were generally, in these cases, ulcerations of the coecum, colon, and rectum. In one case of fever, the substance of the spleen was quite dissolved. It had the appearance of dark coloured mud, without a single trace of a blood vessel remaining. The most urgent symptom, in that case, was a raging thirst. The treatment, in every instance of disease of high exhaustion, was conducted on the same plan that was pursued in the foregoing cases. And I have the satisfaction to say, that I did not lose a single patient, who came under my charge in the incipient stage of disease. But as it is not my design to set my own judgment in com∣petition with that of any other person, I will only affirm, that the practice resulting from the principles of the new doc∣trine, was in general infinitely more successful, than the com∣mon mode of practice, in like cases, has ever been in my own hands. That of Dr. Yates, and Mr. Brydie, founded upon the same principles, was attended with undeniable success.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="033254_0176_0ff6a98d0aff71e8"/>
XV. FROM all these facts I conclude, that lesion of particular organs, such as to render them unfit for the performance of their proper functions, is the state which constitutes an incurable disease,
<PB N="185" REF="033254_0177_0ff6a990e3d942e8"/>
when the foregoing principles are skilfully ap∣plied.</P>
<P>XVI. TO what degree a lesion of organs, of primary importance to life, may take place consistently with the re-establishment of health, is a point that is by no means ascertained. We have now, how∣ever, one criterion by which to judge, with tole∣rable accuracy, when organic lesion actually ex∣ists.</P>
<P>THE prosecution of this subject, conducted up∣on the principles which have now been explained, may be attended with important advantages to the practice of medicine; and it is hoped will not be neglected by those, who wish to exercise their in∣tellectual powers upon subjects of real importance.</P>

<Q>SCIENCE has much to deplore from the Multiplicity of Diseases.—It is as repugnant to truth in Medicine, as Polytheism is to Truth in Religion. The Physician who considers every different Affection of the different Systems in the Body, or every Affection of different Parts of the same System, as distinct Diseases, when they arise from one Cause, resembles the Indian or African Savage, who con∣siders Water, Dew, Ice, Frost and Snow, as distinct Es∣sences: while the Physician, who considers the morbid Affections of every part of the Body (however diversified they may be, in their Form or Degrees) as derived from one Cause, resembles the Philosopher, who considers Dew, Ice, Frost and Snow, as different Modifications of Water, and as derived simply from the Absence of Heat.

<HEAD>DISSERTATION ON THE SOURCE OF EPIDEMIC AND PESTILENTIAL DISEASES, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IN endeavouring to promote knowledge, it may sometimes be as useful to correct ancient errors as to promulgate new discoveries. In medicine, doctrines of the greatest importance have been handed down from generation to generation, which altho' demonstrably false, have never once been called in question. The supposed exist∣ence of contagion in plague, dysentery, and fe∣vers, appears to me, to be a very remark∣able instance of this propensity in man, to pursue the beaten tract, however unprofitable or unsafe. Is not this conduct often the effect of selfishness, choosing to avoid the responsibility of innova∣tion?
<PB N="190" REF="033254_0181_0ff6a9a337be2058"/>
And is it not for the same reason, that erroneous doctrines generally remain longer undisproved, in proportion to the extent of their influence upon practise? However that may be, it is certain that contagious matter has, in all ages, been considered, by the multitude, as the cause of plague, dysentery, and fevers,—by far the most destructive diseases that affect the human race. And this hipothesis, upon the belief of which must have depended, and may yet depend, the lives of millions of our fellow-creatures, seems to have been implicitly assented to, by every phy∣sician, from Hippocrates to the present day.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH I had long entertained doubts up∣on this subject, it was not till very lately, that I was led to consider it, with particular attention. Upon perusing Dr. Rush's publication on the yellow fever, which desolated Philadelphia in 1793, all my former doubts recurred, with ten fold force; and the history of that epide∣mic, served to complete my conviction, <HI>that no general disease, which affects a person more than once during life, can ever be communicated by contagion.</HI> But as this term may be variously understood, it may not be improper to give a definition of it in this place. Contagion I conceive to be—a spe∣cific matter, generated in a person affected with disease, and capable of communicating that par∣ticular
<PB N="191" REF="033254_0182_0ff6a9a5027b6040"/>
disease, with or without contact, to ano∣ther.</P>
<P>WAS it a matter of mere idle speculation to in∣quire into the truth of this hypothesis, not less respectable from its antiquity than from the uni∣versality of its adoption, I should have been en∣tirely silent. But the frequent recurrence and great mortality of epidemic and pestilential dis∣eases, in many parts of the globe, render it an object of the most essential importance to ascer∣tain, whether they are ever contagious. That they never arise from that source, I shall endea∣vour to prove, in the following manner:—</P>
<P N="1">1st—BY shewing that consequences would ne∣cessarily result from the existence of contagion in epidemic and pestilential diseases, which do not actually take place.</P>
<P N="2">2dly.—BY shewing that the existence of con∣tagion, has always been taken for granted in these diseases, not only without any proof, but even cantrary to the evidence of numerous and con∣vincing facts.</P>
<P N="3">3dly—BY pointing out the real source of such epidemic and pestilential diseases, as have usual∣ly been reputed contagious; viz. a certain state or certain vicissitudes of the atmosphere, toge∣ther

with the casual application of other powers, producing indirect debility<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When any reference is made to general medical princi∣ples, in this Dissertation, they are understood to be those of the Elementa Medicinae Brunonis, with the modifications of that doctrine, contained in the preceding "View of the Science of Life."</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I—CONSEQUENCES would result from the exis∣tence of contagion, in epidemic and pestilential diseases, which do not actually take place.</P>
<P>IF a person be affected with any contagious disease, it will necessarily be communicated to every other person who comes within the infec∣tious distance <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">By infectious distance, I do not mean to express any de∣finite space, but merely the distance at which contagion is supposed to act.</NOTE>, and is not at the time labouring under some disease higher in degree <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Vide prop. viii. View of the Science of Life.</NOTE>. But it is well known, to every one conversa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪ in the sub∣ject, that in plague, dysentery, and fevers, a ve∣ry small proportion only of those, who come within what may be supposed to be the infectious distance, or even in contact with the sick, is seized with these diseases. In the most universal epidemic, it does not appear that a tenth part of the whole inhabitants of a city, has ever been, at
<PB N="193" REF="033254_0184_0ff6a9acd4f478b0"/>
one time, affected. But let it be supposed, that eve∣ry sixth person might have been seized; is it credi∣ble that the remaining five sixths were, either, not within the infectious distance, or were at the time, labouring under some disease higher in de∣gree, than the prevailing epidemic? If it even be admitted that, in a terrible pestilence, one half of the inhabitants of a city, may possibly be affected, the supposition that the other half could escape, if the disease was contagious, would be more extravagant; for the greater the number affected, the less chance must any individual have, of being exempted from contagion. Allowing that one person in ten may not have been within the infectious distance; and that one in an hundred may have been labouring, at the time, under a more severe disease, than the prevailing epidemic; such is the exact proportion that would escape. The reverse, however, is probably true. But whatever may be the proportion of the num∣ber seized, to those that escape, it cannot be doubted that the application of powers, which produced the disease, in the person first affected, is adequate to produce the same effect, in all those, who are subsequently seized.</P>
<P>AS the fact cannot be denied, that a great majority have escaped, after contact with persons ill of diseases supposed to be contagious, attempts may perhaps be made to account for it, by sup∣posing
<PB N="194" REF="033254_0185_0ff6a9b022dfc7b8"/>
a certain peculiarity of constitution, which exempts from, or disposes to disease. Is it the many, who escape, that have this happy peculi∣arity of constitution; or the few, who are seized, that are so unfortunate as to possess it? The former are evidently too numerous to admit of such an hypothesis. The property must, there∣fore, I conclude, be given to the latter. But a child, here and there, is exempted from small-pox, although exposed to its contagion. In order to preserve a consistency, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s fact must be accounted for, by the same, or another peculi∣arity of constitution. Peculiarities of consti∣tution, then, exempt from contagion in one case, and dispose to it in another▪ and thus a term, which in reality means nothing, may be made to account for any thing. For my own part, I must confess my inability to comprehend any other <HI>peculiarities of constitution,</HI> or <HI>idiosyncrasies of habit</HI> than what are constituted, by the differ∣ent degrees of health and disease,—the different states of the excitability.</P>
<P>IT appears, therefore, wholly unnecessary, for any purpose that I know, to suppose that, in epi∣demic and pestilential diseases, contagious matter is generated in those individuals who are first seiz∣ed, and from them communicated to others; un∣less indeed, it be determined, at all events, to take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> existence of such a power for granted.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="033254_0186_0ff6a9b211c6aca8"/>IT is a well known law of nature, that small-pox, meazles, and other general diseases, which are unquestionably contagious, occur, in the same per∣son, only once during life. It is also acknow∣ledged by every author, who has written upon the subject, that plague, dysentery, and fevers af∣fect the same person, as often as the powers which produce them are appied. Dr. Alexander Russel, affirms of the plague
<Q>the having had this distem∣per once, does not prevent the contracting it again. I have seen instances of the same per∣son being infected three several times, in the same season.</Q>
A similar observation is made by Dr. Rush, respecting the yellow fever of Phila∣delphia. Cases of reinfection," says he,
<Q>were very common during the prevalence of this fe∣ver.</Q></P>
<P>SMALL-POX, meazles, and other general disea∣ses, which occur only once during life, never dis∣appear, until the whole of those who have been within the infectious distance, and were not, at the time, labouring under some disease higher in de∣gree, have received the infection. As these dis∣eases are very mild<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They are not diseases of excessive excitement, but of in∣direct debility, and generally of a low degree.</NOTE>, children sometimes resist the power of contagion, from the superior force of
<PB N="196" REF="033254_0187_0ff6a9b4c624d488"/>
other diseases, although they may be so slight as to escape common observation. I will venture to as∣sert that no person, in perfect health, ever was, or can be exposed to the power of contagion, without receiving the specific disease, which that contagion produces; excepting in small pox, mea∣zels, &amp;c. when the person has previously the dis∣ease.</P>
<P>PLAGUE, dysentery, and fevers, then, as they are not subject to the same law, would, if they were contagious, never disappear. The conta∣gion, meeting with no obstacle from other disea∣ses, feverer in degree (for there are few indeed of that description) would exercise an unlimited and fatal sway. No person could escape. Those, who once recovered would, again and again, be seized. Infection would proceed, in a continued circle, un∣til the whole human race was extinguished.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE existence of contagion in plague, dy∣sentery, and fevers, has uniformly been taken for granted, not only without proof, but even con∣trary to the evidence of numerous and convinc∣ing facts.</P>
<P>IT is well known, that, in hospitals, camps, and ships, a very small proportion only of those, who sleep within a short distance of, are frequent∣ly in conversation, or even in contact with, per∣sons
<PB N="197" REF="033254_0188_0ff6a9ba976380c8"/>
ill of typhus, dysentery, or fever, is seized with these diseases. So far from infection being invariably communicated in this manner, no in∣stance of it has ever been distinctly traced. If such cases had ever been recorded, we must either reject them as false, or abandon one of the funda∣mental axioms of philosphy. For, whatever has happened once, must happen often; it must hap∣pen always, in similar circumstances. But in the situations alluded to, these circumstances con∣stantly occur, and the alledged effects do not fol∣low. It is not fair to conclude, that dysentery is contagious, because one person happens to be tak∣en ill, while in the neighbourhood of another, who has got the disease. If the conclusion was just, all within the infectious distance, not labour∣ing under a disease higher in degree, would be similarly affected. They would have the disease with as much equality of force as children have the small-pox. In proportion to the number af∣fected, the power of contagion would increase. It would proceed in a geometrical ratio, diverg∣ing from the centre, to every point of the circum∣ference, of a city, a camp, an hospital, or a ship. It is evident then, that in these situations, a con∣tagion, which and the power of producing its pe∣culiar diease, in the same person, more than once during life, would never disappear. But dysen∣tery, fevers, and the plague itself cease, in all
<PB N="198" REF="033254_0189_0ff6a9bd3724e5c8"/>
those situations, without having affected perhaps a tenth part of the community. They cease too when they are epidemic, according to some peri∣odical law, which evinces that they do not arise from any casual and uncertain source, like the accidental application of contagious matter.</P>
<P>THE absurdity of the conclusions which result from admitting contagious matter to be the cause of epidemic and pestilential diseases could not have been overlooked till now, if the existence of such a source had not been so implicitly taken for granted, that even to call in question the truth of it, must, to many, have the appearance of succes∣sive scepticism. But I shall endeavour to deduce my conclusions, from such numerous and un∣doubted facts, as ought, perhaps, to exempt me from that imputation.</P>
<P>DURING the prevalence of epidemic and pesti∣lential diseases, it is well known, that nurses, and other attendants upon the sick, are not more liable to be affected than other people, who un∣dergo an equal degree of fatigue. It may per∣haps, be said, that they become habituated to the contagion. But how do they escape the first ap∣plication of it? They have not then got the ha∣bit. No person of that description caught the in∣fection from those who died, of what was called the jail fever at the black assizes at Oxford; a
<PB N="199" REF="033254_0190_0ff6a9bf67c82888"/>
case of alledged contagion so generally known, and so frequently quoted by authors. That the power, which occasioned disease at the Oxford assizes, was not contagious matter, is proved by its producing diarhoea in some, while it produced fevers in others. And further, no person was seized, who had not been directly exposed to the influence of the noxious air. Specific contagion, I conceive, cannot produce a disease less uniform in its appearance, than small-pox and meazles. But every epidemic and pestilential disease, which has hitherto been reputed contagious, assumes such various and dissimilar appearances, in differ∣ent persons, that they cannot be the effect of any power, equal and uniform in its operation. The symptoms are not, in any two persons, exactly alike. Hence the difference of opinion among the physicians of Philadelphia, during their late epidemic; some asserting that every disease had resolved itself into yellow fever, while others, cer∣tainly with more reason, affirmed that the diseases of the city, were various. No epidemic can become so general, as to suppress all other diseases; because all men, labouring under dis∣eases of lower degree, are not exposed to the powers which produce an epidemic. The same person indeed cannot, at the same time,
<PB N="200" REF="033254_0191_0ff6a9c2adc61bf0"/>
have both a dysentery and a dropsy;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is only meant, in as far as they are general diseases; for, the local affections, which have obtained these names, as they occur in different parts of the body, may readily co-exist.</NOTE> but every usual variety of disease may exist in a com∣munity, even in the time of a powerful epide∣mic, altho' the epidemic be the most general dis∣order. The dissimilarity of symptoms, which occasioned this difference of opinion at Philadel∣phia, is, to me, a convincing proof, were there not many others, that the yellow fever of that ci∣ty, did not arise from any power, of such uni∣form operation, as contagious matter. Like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine, opium, or mercury, specific contagion must produce similar effects, upon all men, who are similarly situated. It must act alike in Egypt and in America, in London and in Constantino∣ple. But, according to all accounts, the symp∣toms of epidemic diseases, in different parts of the world, are very dissimilar; while those of dis∣eases that are undoubtedly contagious, such as small-pox, meazles, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> venerea, &amp;c. are the same in all. Wine will intoxicate, cathartics will purge, mercury will salivate in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll countries. They will produce these effects, upon almost all men; certainly upon all men who are in health. Those only, who are in a state of disease, higher
<PB N="201" REF="033254_0192_0ff6a9c57277ad80"/>
in degree than these powers can produce, will resist their operation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is impossible, with the greatest quantity of mercury that has ever been given, to salivate a person, whose liver is in a state of supuration. No quantity of wine will intoxicate a person, ill of typhus fever, without having first cured the disease.</NOTE> But this proportion can∣not be one in a thousand, perhaps not one in ten thousand. Such also may be the proportion that would escape, from the effects of a specific con∣tagion, applied to them. It is common, how∣ever, for men in health, to be exposed to contact with the sick, and to escape. In that case, con∣tagion, if the disease had been c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntagious, must inevitably have been applied; and without producing its imputed effects.</P>
<P>WAS not the typhus fever, by which so many of the unfortunate people, who were imprison∣ed in the black hole of Calcutta, perished, at∣tended with an endless variety of symptoms? It does not appear that the disease was, in that case, communicated to any person, who had not breathed the polluted air of the dungeon. Will it be said, that the Nabob Surajeddoullah had previously ordered contagious matter to be in∣serted into the black hole? If not, whence was it imported, or where generated?</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="033254_0193_0ff6a9cb46194b68"/>IN the history of these diseases, I think it may be remarked, that physicians have been peculi∣arly exempted from their influence. Is it that there is a principle of repulsion between medical skill and contagion? or is it not rather for this plain reason, that these diseases depend upon some other power, which the physician is better able to avoid? For, will any reasonable person assert, that a medical practitioner (unless the structure of his body be supposed different from that of other people) can visit a patient ten or twelve times, feel his pulse, and converse with him, without receiving the infection, if the dis∣ease of the patient be contagious, and the practi∣tioner has not, at the time, a disease of higher degree? Physicians, in perfect health, have at∣tended as many patients, ill of diseas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itherto reputed contagious, as they could visit in the day; and yet have escaped. But it is as absurd to believe, that a person can be exposed to the influence of any power, capable of producing plague, dysentery, or fever, without being affected, as that a large quantity of spirituous liquors, or stimuli, still more diffusible, can be applied to living bodies, without producing a correspondent effect. If it be at all admitted, that contagion is the cause of these diseases; it must also be admitted, that contagion, as in this
<PB N="203" REF="033254_0194_0ff6a9cdea55a580"/>
case, may sometimes be applied, without pro∣ducing its effect,—which is impossible.</P>
<P>ANOTHER fact worthy of notice is, that aged persons and children, are both seldomer and less severely attacked by epidemic and pestilential dis∣eases, than the young and middle aged; and women seldomer and less severely than men. Now, if contagion was the source of these dis∣eases, the case would be exactly reversed. Old people, women, and children, being more in the way of contagion, would be more frequently and more severely attacked. But the young and middle aged, being more exposed to the vicissi∣tudes of the atmosphere,—the principal source, as I shall afterwards endeavour to shew, of those diseases, than aged persons and children, and men more than women, they are consequently more severely attacked. It has been a puzzling question to solve,
<Q>why old people and chil∣dren have been less obnoxious to plague, dy∣sentery, and fevers, than the young and middle aged; and women less than men?</Q>
But the solution will no longer be difficult, if it should be proved that these diseases never arise from contagion, but are always produced by certain states or certain vicissitudes of the atmos∣phere, together with the application of other powers, co-operating in the production of indi∣rect
<PB N="204" REF="033254_0195_0ff6a958b0a3ef50"/>
debility. For, it is evident that, to the influence of these states, or vicissitudes, and of these powers, the young and middle aged are al∣ways more exposed than old people and chil∣dren; and men more than women.</P>
<P>LET a person, in the height of a pestilential disease, be removed from the atmosphere which occasioned it, into one more pure, he will com∣municate the infection to no one.
<Q>It has been remarked,</Q>
says Dr. Rush, speaking of the yel∣low fever of Philadelphia
<Q>that this fever did not spread in the country, when carried there by persons who were infected, and afterwards died with it.</Q>
In another place he observes,
<Q>during four times that it occurred in Charles∣ton, in no one instance, according to Dr. Lining, was it propagated in any other part of the state.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide an account of the bilious, remitting, yellow fever, of Philadelphia, by B. Rush, M. D. page 157.</NOTE> Convincing proofs these, that the disease did not depend upon contagion, but upon the state of the atmosphere at Philadelphia in the one case, and at Charleston in the other. The va∣rious ways in which the College of Physicians of Philadelphia and Dr. Rush attempted to account for the origin of the contagion, which they sup∣posed had produced the yellow fever of 1793.
<PB N="205" REF="033254_0196_0ff6a9d0a365a540"/>
shews into what inconsistencies the most sensible men may be betrayed, when they attempt to reason upon false data. Having all taken the <HI>existence</HI> of contagion for granted, they only differ with respect to the <HI>origin</HI> of it. The College was of opinion, that it was <HI>imported</HI>; Dr. Rush affirmed, that it was <HI>generated</HI> in the city. A better de∣scription cannot be given of the several hypothe∣ses, which distracted the faculty, upon this occa∣sion, than in his own words,
<Q>public report had derived it</Q>
(the contagion)
<Q>from several different Islands; had chased it from ship to ship, and from shore to shore; and finally con∣veyed it, at different times, in the city, alter∣nately by dead and living bodies; and from these tales, all of which, when investigated, were proved to be without foundation, the col∣lege of physicians composed their letter.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Containing their opinion respecting the origin and treat∣ment of the Yellow Fever. Vide Rush, page 21.</NOTE> It would seem, from this conduct of the col∣lege, as if medical superstition had changed its names, and that in accounting for the origin of pestilential fevers, celestial, planetary, and demoniacal influence, had only yielded to the term—<HI>importation</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vide an Account of the Yellow Fever, page 164.</NOTE>.</Q>
But it does not appear that Dr. Rush, in his attempts to trace the origin of the contagion, was more successful
<PB N="206" REF="033254_0197_0ff6a9d313b12b10"/>
than the college. He supposed it to arise from putrid, vegetable exhalation, produced by a heap of damaged coffee, lying on a wharf. But the progress of the disease was not traced, with any certainty, to that focus. It is evident, indeed, from Dr. Rush's own account, that the inhabit∣ants of other streets had been as early and as ge∣nerally affected, as those of the streets in the im∣mediate neighbourhood of the coffee.</P>
<P>IN this, and every other case of epidemic and pestilential disease, the existence of contagion would seem to have been uniformly taken for granted, not only without examination, but even contrary to the evidence of numerous facts—a conduct certainly not less unphilosophical in me∣dicine, than in any other department of science.</P>
<P N="3">3—CERTAIN states or vicissitudes of the at∣mosphere, together with the application of other powers, producing indirect debility, are the cause of all epidemic and pestilential diseases, which affect the same person more than once during life, and have hitherto been reputed contagious,</P>
<P>EVERY country has its unhealthy season, cor∣responding with some particular period of the year, at which the diseases, peculiar to that coun∣try, are more general and severe than at other times. This is observed to happen, in those months most remarkable for heat, calm weather,
<PB N="207" REF="033254_0198_0ff6a9d52e3e2a50"/>
or sudden vicissitudes of the atmosphere; and they are nearly the same in all parts of the world. In Europe, Asia, Africa and America, from July to October, with little variation, includes the most unhealthy portion of the year. In some places indeed, as Aleppo, that happens from April to July; but always with a certain regula<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ty, coinciding with periodical states of the weather. The diseases which anunally arise from this source, are not always general or severe. It is only when the heat, calm weather, or vicissitudes of the at∣mosphere, have been uncommon, that the ordi∣nary diseases of the season arise to a degree, which constitutes epidemic and pestilential diseases.</P>
<P>FROM every record of epidemic and pestilenti∣al diseases, it would appear, that they have their stated periods of recurrence; that these periods are such months, as are most remarkable for vi∣cissitudes of the atmosphere; that they become general, only in years in which these vicissitudes are exteme; that they do not occur in seasons when the degrees of heat or cold, however in∣tense, are equable; nor in years when the state of the atmosphere remains tempered throughout; and that they uniformly cease, with the estab∣lishment of an equable state of the atmosphere, whether the weather be hot or cold.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="033254_0199_0ff6a9d70f871ce8"/>THE yellow fever in America
<Q>appeared six different times about the 1st or middle of Au∣gust, and declined or ceased about the mid∣dle of October—viz. in 1732, 1739, 1745, and 1748 in Charleston; in 1791 in New York; and 1793 in Philadelphia.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rush on the Yellow Fever.</NOTE> In 1793, the yellow fever appeared also in different parts of the West Indies.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vide Chisholm on the Malignant, Pestilential Fever, &amp;c.</NOTE> Attempts were made, in the Islands, to trace the contagion to the con∣tinent. On the continent it was traced back to the Islands. But why should we hesitate to be∣lieve, that the same general causes which produc∣ed unusual vicissitudes of the atmosphere, in the one country, should extend their influence to the other? In the same year, and the same sea∣son, the English settlers, on the coast of Africa, were siezed with a fever, which proved fatal to a great number of them. It happened, at this period, that a ship arrived from Boullam, on the coast of Africa, at Grenada, in the West Indies. And hence the contagion was supposed, by Dr. Chisholm and others, to have been im∣ported in that ship. Was it necessary, it might easily be shewn, that these suppositions were adopted upon very slight grounds. But if the ex∣istence of contagion can be disproved upon gene∣ral
<PB N="209" REF="033254_0200_0ff6a9da46267e50"/>
grounds, it would be superfluous to investi∣gate every particular circumstance in its favour, that may have been hastily assumed as a fact.</P>
<P>IN Aleppo, according to Dr. Russell, the European inhabitants regularly shut themselves up, in their houses, every year, at some period between April and July. And the rich natives begin to adopt the same plan, as far as their cus∣toms will permit them to do, without scandal. From this fact, it appears that the plague occurs at Aleppo, in a state less or more mild, almost annually, and <HI>that it commences and ceases at cer∣tain known periods.</HI> But it has been remarked there that, in its most severe state, this dis∣ease recurs only at periods of ten years, or there-abouts—a regularity, which cannot, upon any known principle, be attributed to a power of such casual application, as contagious matter.</P>
<P>It has farther been observed of the plague, that
<Q>the winter puts an end to it at Constanti∣nople; the summer destroys it in Egypt.</Q>
In fact, what epedemic or pestilential disease has been known to occur with severity at these peri∣ods of the year? But, in order to account for this, will it be said, that contagion is destroyed, both by heat and by cold? The assertion would certainly be absurd. Besides the fact can be muhc better explained. At these periods, the body is
<PB N="210" REF="033254_0201_0ff6a9dfc5d702a8"/>
not so liable to disease, because it is not exposed to the effects of heat and cold, dryness and moisture, tempestuous and calm weather, suddenly and frequently alternated. These vi∣cissitudes are most remarkable in spring and autumn, which accordingly are the sea∣sons, most fertile of diseases, in all parts of the globe. It is a curious circumstance, and much to our present purpose, that the belief of the Turks in the contagious nature of the plague, has considerably increased, since their communi∣cation with Europeans has become more extend∣ed. Formerly there was no want of servants, or relations, to undertake every necessary office about the sick, the same as in any common dis∣temper; but now, it is difficult to procure even mercenary attendants. "I have met," says Dr. Russell, speaking of the plague at Aleppo in 1760,
<Q>with several instances, even in Turkish houses, where the mistress of the family was not only ill attended, but even abandoned through the timidity of her daughters and slaves. I apprehend the dread of contagion gains ground among the Mahommedans, in all parts of Syria, where the Europeans have much commerce.</Q>
Mahommed, having pro∣bably perceived the bad consequences that would result from such a dread, condemned the belief of diseases being spread by contagion, as <HI>impious.</HI> And this at least shews, that the plague has not
<PB N="211" REF="033254_0202_0ff6a9e39abcf498"/>
always been supposed, by the Turks, to arise from contagion; or if it has, that the belief was deemed injurious. With the example of Europe∣an credulity before them, the modern followers of Mahommed may, in no long time, put more faith in contagion, than in this law of their pro∣phet. But in such a renunciation of faith, e∣ven a Christian will have little cause to rejoice. If it should appear to be only a substitution of one error for another, Europeans will not have much reason to ridicule the former stupidity of the Turks; nor to boast of their own superior penetration, in intoducing among them a belief in the contagious nature of pestilential diseases.</P>
<P>PHYSICIANS, having observed the dependence of epidemic diseases upon the state of the atmosphere, their uniform appearance under some states, and cessation under others, could not well reconcile these facts with the hypothesis of contagion. But a reconciliation was, at all events, determined upon. The state of the atmosphere was made to act upon the matter of contagion, in such a man∣ner as to explain every phoenomenon. Is the weather hot, when an epidemic commences, heat gives activity to contagion; is it cold, cold is favourable to contagion; is it dry, the contagion is concentrated; is it wet, diluted: even vicissi∣tudes set it in motion. But should the epidemic
<PB N="212" REF="033254_0203_0ff6a9e7915cc360"/>
happen to cease, during any of these states of the atmosphere, this may with equal facility be ac∣counted for, by assigning to the <HI>same</HI> powers, as has frequently been done in medical reasoning, <HI>different</HI> or even <HI>opposite</HI> modes of operation. Let the existence of contagion be once admitted as a fact, and there is nothing more easy than to trace its orign to some ideal source. The most obvious, and therefore the most frequently insisted upon, is contact with some person, ill of the same dis∣ease. But as the person, who happens to be first seized, could not have received the infection in that manner, it was found necessary to refer it to various sources. Even with those advantages, however, it was often difficult, and exercised the ingenuity of the learned, to discover the origin of particular epidemics. The imputed sources of those calamities became at length so numerous, that it requires little labour to trace the origin of all dis∣eases to some one, or other of them. If, for in∣stance, it cannot be traced to actual contact, it will probubly be discovered, that the patient has, at some recent period, been exposed to the effluvia of rotten hemp, flax, coffee, cabbage, onions, black pepper, or potatoes; for all of these pow∣ers have been said to produce epidemics. But in years, when these diseases are so highly pesti∣lential,
<PB N="213" REF="033254_0204_0ff6a9e9cd6a3828"/>
that the effluvia, arising from a heap of rotten vegetables, might seem too trifling a pow∣er to produce such important effects, recourse may still be had to the importation of contagious matter, in bales of goods from the Mediterra∣nean; or, with the ingenious Gibbon, to the gene∣ration of it, by swarms of putrid locusts, in Egypt. These hypotheses, were they not supported by the authority of celebrated names, are almost too ri∣diculous for refutation. That a parcel of rotten vegetables should produce a disease, that is con∣tagious, and capable of producing desolation and death, over a populous city▪ ought not certainly to be credited without proof; and with respect to proof, it does not appear that there is any, excepting that, during the prevalance of epide∣mics, vegetables have become putrid. Was pu∣trid vegetable exhalation ever the cause of a con∣tagious disease, it would spread in an evident and regular progression, affecting first those who are nearest to its source. There could be no possibitity of mistaking or overlooking the cause. But as no such progress has ever been ascertained, and as it might have easily been traced, had there been any truth in the opinion, it is every way in∣consistent with just reasoning to admit, that pu∣trid vegetable exhalation can be the cause of con∣tagion.—I mean not to deny, that putrid vegeta∣ble exhalation may produce disease, but the disease
<PB N="214" REF="033254_0205_0ff6a9eb95456388"/>
will be contagious. There cannot be a doubt that putrid vegetable exhalation is a power, ca∣pable of producing disease, in its immediate neighbourhood; but it is equally certain, that it never can occasion an epidemic or pistilential dis∣ease, over a whole country, or city. The pu∣tridity of vegetables, and the epidemic diseases of animals, are probably occasioned by the same power, viz. a certain state or certain vicissitudes of the atmosphere. That kind of weather or that disposition of the surrounding elements, which occasions an uncommon mortality among animals and vegetables, will also produce an uncommon degree of putrefaction, among these substances, their dead state.</P>
<P>COULD the history of all epidemic and pestilen∣tial diseases of animals be minutely traced, I am-well convinced it would be found that they have uniformly been attended with correspondent dis∣eases of vegetables, in that particular part of a country, to which they have been confined. For, as all living bodies are subject to the same laws,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide prop. I. View of the Science of Life.</NOTE> it is evident that any power, which can produce general disease in animals, will have the same ef∣fect upon that portion of vegetable substances to which it is applied; and <HI>vice versa.</HI> Accordingly those diseases of indirect debility of vegetables,
<PB N="215" REF="033254_0206_0ff6a95ae473a270"/>
known to farmers by the terms <HI>rust</HI> and <HI>blast,</HI> have ofte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> been observed to occur, at the same time with epidemic diseases among animals. And the rea∣son why such a coincidence has not always been expressly noticed, is probably, that the subject has not been considered in this point of view. If such a coincidence then should be found invariably true, will it be said that contagion may be communi∣cated from animals to vegetables, and from vege∣tables to animals?</P>
<P>WHEN particular districts of a country, whole nations, or considerable portions of a continent, are suffering from a scarcity of grain, will it be said that the disease of vegetables, which is the cause of the scarcity, was produced, not by the state of the atmosphere, but by contagion? In this case, how is the contagious matter to be traced? Is it wafted, as it were by a magic influence, from field to field,—over mountains, rivers, lakes, and oceans? The infectious distance would, in that case, be wide indeed! But I apprehend it will scarcely be contended, that the epidemic diseases of vegetables are contagious. And in regard to animals, the opinion does not appear at all more probable; excepting from the single circumstance of their not being rooted to the soil. Would it not be more rational to admit, that the diseases, in both cases, as produced by the operation of some such general power as the states or vicissi∣tudes
<PB N="216" REF="033254_0207_0ff6a9f458bdbd80"/>
of the atmosphere, to the influence of which animals and vegetables are equally exposed?</P>
<P>OF the numerous facts, by which this proposi∣tion is supported, it will suffice to quote a few. As Dr. Rush's account of the yellow fever of Phila∣delphia is, perhaps, the best history that has been given of any epidemic, it may be often with pro∣priety referred to. There was something in the "heat and drought of the summer months," (1793)
<Q>which was uncommon, in their influ∣ence upon the human body. Labourers every where gave out, (to use the common phrase) in harvest, and frequently too when the mercury in Farenheit's Thermometer was under 84*** **. The crops of grain and grass were impair∣ed by the droughts.</Q></P>
<P>IT appears, from several observations, that there was, that year, an uncommon calmness of the weather.</P>
<P><Q>IN the year 1762, the billious yellow fever prevailed in Philadelphia, after a very hot sum∣mer, and spread like a plague, carrying off dai∣ly, for some time, upwards of twenty persons.</Q>
Can it be doubted, that these states of the weath∣er will produce disease, both among animals and vegetables? And if the operation of such an obvi∣ous power, be adequate to explain the phoenome∣na
<PB N="217" REF="033254_0208_0ff6aa18958d1700"/>
of pestilential diseases, what need is there of adopting an ideal one, like contagious matter, to account for them?</P>
<P>MR. Potter, in a letter to Dr. Rush, dated from Caroline, county Maryland, 1st November, 1793, says,
<Q>it is an invariable maxim here, both among physicians and farmers, that, if the wheat be damaged by rust or blast, a contagious dysen∣tery is soon to follow.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 181.</NOTE></P>
<P>PREVIOUS to the occurrence of every epidemic, something unusual, in the state of the atmosphere, has always been remarked. A yellow fever ap∣peared at Cadiz, after a hot and dry summer in 1764; and at Pensacola, in similar circumstances, in 1765. Was the contagion traced, in this case, from Cadiz to Pensacola, by a direct or circuit∣ous channel, or was it traced at all?—That the yellow fever of Philadelphia, in 1793, depended upon the states or vicissitudes of the atmosphere, evidently appears from the following observations, communicated to Dr. Rush, by a gentleman, who resided occasionally in southern and tropical coun∣tries. He informed him, that he had observed, in
<Q>the month of July, several weeks before the yellow fever became general, a peculiar and
<PB N="218" REF="033254_0209_0ff6a9f68966ff68"/>
universal sallowness of complexion, in the faces of the citizens of Philadelphia, such as he had observed to precede the prevalence of malignant bilious fevers, in hot climates.</Q>
Dr. Dick had
<Q>observed the same appearance in the faces of people in Alexandria, accompanied in some ca∣ses, by a yellowness in the eyes, during the last summer,</Q>
(1793)
<Q>and some time before vio∣lent, bilious fevers became epidemic, upon the banks of the Potowmac.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Rush, page 183.</NOTE> A change so gradu∣al and general in the appearance, both of animals and vegetables, can never be explained by admit∣ting contagion, but is easily and satisfactorily ac∣counted for, by supposing the states or vicissitudes of the atmosphere to have been the noxious pow∣er.
<Q>It appears farther, from the register of the weather, that there was no rain between the 25th of August, and the 15th of October, ex∣cept a few drops, hardly enough to lay the dust of the streets, on the 9th of September, and the 12th of October. In consequence of this drought, the springs and wells failed in many parts of the country. The dust, in some places, extended two feet above the surface of the ground. The pastures were deficient or burnt up. There was a scarcity of autumnal fruits in the neighbourhood of the city. But while veg∣etation
<PB N="219" REF="033254_0210_0ff6aa1b0c72e7a8"/>
drooped or died from the want of mois∣ture in some places, it revived with preterna∣tural vigour, from unusual heat, in others. Cherry trees blossomed, and apple, pear, and plumb trees bore young fruit, in several gar∣dens in Trenton, thirty miles from Philadel∣phia, in the month of October.</Q></P>
<P><Q>HOWEVER unoffensive uniform heat, when agitated by gentle breezes, may be; there is, I believe, no record of a dry, warm, and stag∣nating air, having existed for any length of time, without producing diseases. Hippocrates in describing a pestilential fever, says, the year in which it prevailed, was without a breeze of wind. The same state of the atmosphere, for six weeks, is mentioned in many of the histories of the plague, which prevailed in London, in 1665.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Rush, pages 109—110.</NOTE></P>
<P>THUS all the facts stated by Dr. Rush, and many of his observations prove, that the yellow fever of Philadelphia, in common with other epi∣demics, was produced by the states or vicissitudes of the atmosphere, and not by contagious matter, imported, or generated in the city.</P>
<P>PESTILENTIAL diseases are neither so frequent nor so fatal in modern, as they were in ancient
<PB N="220" REF="033254_0211_0ff6a9f8b99691a8"/>
times. Cities are now more commodiously built; the mode of living is improved; and every circumstance that can contribute to the pre∣servation of health better understood. Is it not from these changes, in the state of society, that London, Paris, Madrid, Lisbon, and Marseilles are now much less subject to epidemic diseases than formerly? And in the progress of improvement, may not these diseases entirely disappear? The inhabitants of Grand Cairo, according to Mr. Savary, are heaped together by thousands. Two hundred citizens there occupy less space than thirty at Paris. Thirty citizens at Paris occupy less space than ten citizens of London. Twenty citizens of Grand Cairo, therefore occupy less space than one citizen of London. The manner in which the citizens of Grand Cairo are thus crouded together, would alone seem sufficient, in a stagnant state of the atmosphere, to produce pestilential diseases of the highest degree.</P>
<P>THE large commercial cities, which have been most frequently ravaged by the plague, are for the convenience of sea ports, built in low and unhealthy situations. Their streets have gene∣rally been irregular, crouded, and dirty. In these cities, therefore, pestilential diseases always commence. This circumstance, together with that effect of self-love, which prevents us from disco∣vering the origin of any evil with ourselves, pro∣bably
<PB N="221" REF="033254_0212_0ff6a95ee4d18598"/>
gave rise to the idea, that contagion was imported in bales of goods, or even in parcels of old clothes, from distant countries. The Epide∣mic of a season, appearing generally in several places at a time, by enabling the inhabitants of one place to trace it to another, has also served to strengthen the same opinion. But may not simi∣lar states of the atmosphere occur in the same season, in Egypt and in Syria, in Damascus and in Aleppo, in Grand Cairo and in Marseilles, in Smyrna and in London, in the West India Islands and in America? And will not these si∣milar states produce pestilential diseases of a si∣milar appearance? The plague, indeed, will ne∣ver appear with similar symptoms in London and in Constantinople, because the states or vicissi∣tudes of the atmosphere, in these two places, can never be exactly alike. But if it depended upon a power, like specific contagion, which must be the same in all places, the symptoms would every where appear with a uniformity similar to those of small-pox.</P>
<P>CONTAGION then, it would seem, cannot ex∣plain the phoenomena of pestilential diseases, without the assistance of the states or vicissitudes of the atmosphere; but the states or vicissitudes of the atmosphere will explain them, without the assistance of contagion. Here I will again avail myself of the authority of Dr. Rush, as far as importation is concerned.
<Q>The report of
<PB N="222" REF="033254_0213_0ff6aa1d7a3cf750"/>
the College of Physicians has served to con∣firm me in an opinion, that the plagues which desolated most of the countries in Europe in former centuries, and which were always said to be foreign extraction, were in most instan∣ces of domestic origin. Between the years 1006 and 1680, the plague was epidemic 52 times all over Europe. It prevailed 14 times in the 14th century. The state of Europe in this long period is well known. Idleness, a deficiency of vegetable aliment, a camp life from the frequency of wars, famine, an un∣cultivated and marshy soil, small cabins, and the want of cleanliness in dress, diet, and furniture, all concurred to generate pestilenti∣al diseases. The plagues which prevailed in London every year, from 1593 to 1611, and from 1636 to 1649, I suspect were generated in that city. The diminution of plagues in Europe, more especially in London, appears to have been produced by the great change in the diet and manners of the people; also by the more commodious and airy forms of the houses of the poor, among whom the plague <HI>always</HI> makes its first appearance. It is true these plagues were said by authors to have been im∣ported, either directly or indirectly from the Levant; but the proofs of such importation were in most cases as vague and deficient as they were of the West-India origin of our late
<PB N="223" REF="033254_0214_0ff6aa1fd4413610"/>
epidemic. The pestilentitl fevers, which have been mentioned, have been described by au∣thors, by the generic name of the plague.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 265—166.</NOTE></P>
<P>WHY do pestilential diseases <HI>always</HI> make their first appearance among the poor? Has contagi∣ous matter an instinctive attachment to this class of men? No. But they are constantly more ex∣posed than the rich, to the principal power, which produces pestilential diseases, viz. cer∣tain states o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> certain vicissitudes of the wea∣ther.</P>
<P>THE vicissitudes of the atmosphere constitute a power great, evident, and extensive, in its effects upon the animal and vegetable world:—a source, to which the epedemic and pestilential diseases of living bodies may, with certainty, be traced. Whereas contagious matter is a power that has uniformly been taken for granted, without ex∣amination; of which the existence, in epidemic and pestilential diseases, is even disproved by a numerous induction of facts; and, if admitted, is incapable of explaining their phaenomena.</P>
<P>FROM all these considerations, I conclude that no general disease, excepting such as occur only once during life, is contagious. And that all epidemic and pestilential diseases, which occur more than once during life, and have hitherto
<PB N="224" REF="033254_0215_0ff6a9fce30bc958"/>
been reputed contagious, depend upon certain states, or certain vicissitudes of the atmosphere, together with the application of other powers, producing indirect debility.</P>
<P>VIEWING this as not merely a question of idle medical disputation, but as one of the utmost practical importance, I regret that neither my abilities nor my situation, enable me to do it that justice, which it certainly deserves. The attempt, which I have made, may however, be the means of calling forth the observations of others, better qualified to illustrate the subject. Whether the existence of contagion, in epidemic and pestilential diseases, be ultimately proved, or disproved, a discussion, and decision of the ques∣tion must be attended with considerable utility. Let us take a view of the pernicious consequen∣ces which result from the opinion now received, supposing it to be false; and contrast it with the benefits that would arise from a contrary one, supposing it to be true.</P>
<P>THE consternation and mortality, occasioned by epidemic diseases, must always be greatly in∣creased, by a belief in their contagious nature. Those who are yet well, will be the more readily affected; and those who are ill, will be in great∣er danger of suffering, from the desertion of timid relations, or mercenary attendants. What serious evils may not the dread of contagion
<PB N="225" REF="033254_0216_0ff6aa23d401c7c8"/>
produce, among the uninformed multitude, when it can occasion such scenes as the following, among sensible men of the medical profession? In 1665, we find Dr. Hodges prescribing, from his parlor window, for patients in the streets of London; and at a later period, Dr. P. Russell prescribing from a chamber window, fifteen feet above the level of the streets at Aleppo. Dr. A. Russell's candid account of the manner in which he prescribed, is worthy of note; both as it tends to disprove contagion, and to shew the pernicious consequences of believing in it.
<Q>In the two preceding years</Q>
(he wrote in 1744)
<Q>I had prescribed for the sick, chiefly from the accounts brought me by a person, whom I em∣ployed to visit them; for though before shutt∣ing up, I was often, in spight of all my pre∣cautions, deceived by false representations of the case, and led to visit some of the infected; yet I avoided it to the utmost of my power: but this year the dread of contagion (like that of other dangers to which one has been long exposed) being much worn off, I attended the sick in the plague in the same manner as those labouring under ordinary fevers.</Q>
Could Dr. Russell, or his deputy, have attended the sick, with impunity, if the disease had been contagi∣ous? In other words, can a power be applied, without producing its correspondent effect? I
<PB N="226" REF="033254_0217_0ff6aa28c695f960"/>
know not by what refinement of sophistry the force of this objection can be alluded. To come down to a period still more recent, some of the physicians of Philadelphia are said to have fled the city, during the prevalence of their late epide∣mic; a conduct that must have added both to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he consternation and mortality of their patients. The effects of a popular belief in such opinions are, in my estimation, no less injurious to man∣kind, than they are humiliating to the medical profession. What would be said of a military officer, who deserted his post at the sight of an enemy, leaving his fellow-soldiers to fight the battle? During the rage of an epidemic, phy∣sicians may be looked upon as general officers, in whom it is always regarded more shameful to abandon the field of battle, than in private soldiers.</P>
<P>IF on the other hand, a belief in contagion was entirely laid aside, the European inhabitants of Aleppo, and other places subject to the plague, would no longer shut themselves up in their hous∣es, for fear of contagion. They would only re∣main at home occasionally, to avoid the influence of the sun, or vicissitudes of the weather. Instead of a constant confinement for several months, they would only think it necessary to refrain from go∣ing abroad during the hottest part of the day; or to take precautions against the morning and
<PB N="227" REF="033254_0218_0ff6aa004f6dff38"/>
evening fogs. Thus the dread inspired by the apprehensions of infection, would happily be ba∣nished from their minds; and that alone would be a powerful mean of protecting them from disease. It is not supposed, however, that the custom of shutting up is useless. The utility of it is evident; and it is as evidently founded upon a principle very different from that of avoiding contagion. By con∣finement, the inhabitants of Aleppo avoid expo∣sure to heat, and the vicissitudes of the weather, which are the real source of the plague. But their confinement, if regulated upon principle, need neither be so constant nor so anxious.</P>
<P>ANOTHER advantage that would result from rejecting the doctrine of contagion, in pestilential diseases, is that the quarantines usually exacted of ships, coming from places suspected of contagion, would no longer be considered necessary. The hardship, or rather the cruelty of such ordeals, is too evident to require a comment. Could the con∣tagion be conveyed in the manner supposed, the injury to individuals must of course be suffered, on account of the community. But if it be prov∣ed that this cannot happen, the restriction must appear exceedingly absurd. Is it probable, that London being exempted from pestilential diseases, for many years past, will be imputed to the won∣derful strictness, with which Mediterranean
<PB N="228" REF="033254_0219_0ff6aa0274b61848"/>
ships have been made to perform this forty days farce?</P>
<P>ABOVE all, the adoption of this theory, by recalling physicians from a wrong tract of investi∣gation, would probably be the means of enabling them to apply principles to the cure of all epide∣mic diseases, hitherto so often fatal, which would render them little more dangerous, than common fevers are at this day.—Instead of wasting time in tracing contagious matter from city to city, they would endeavour to discover what are the particular states or vicissitudes of the atmosphere, which produce epidemic diseases; what are the causes of these vicissitudes; and what are the best modes of counteracting their effects upon the hu∣man body.</P>
<P>THIS subject is highly worthy of investigation. For though it may be said that, as the stimu∣lant powers, which are found to cure epidemic diseases, afford a proof that they depend upon a very great degree of indirect debility, and that therefore a minute acquaintance with the pow∣ers which occasioned them is not necessary to guide the practice; yet it must also be admitted, that every link, in the chain of knowledge, is a valuable acquisition.—There is not a fact in na∣ture, from which some useful inference my not be drawn.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="observations">
<PB N="229" REF="033254_0220_0ff6aa2b05cfabc0"/>
<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON THE CURE.</HEAD>
<P>WHATEVER be the powers that produce epi∣demic diseases, it is evident, from those which are found to cure them, that they all depend upon a high state of indirect debility. Fevers and dysentery have of late, every where, yielded to the powers of mercury, and other stimuli of the most diffusible kind. That is, those medi∣cines have been found more successful, than any that were ever used before. If eight grains of calomel, and four grains of opium, repeated every two, three, or four hours, will cure a fever, or a dysentery of a certain degree, will not the same medicines produce the same effect in plague▪ if given in quantities proportionate to the force of the disease? Ought not the physicians of Aleppo to give a fair trial to a medicine in plague, which has been found so successful in other epidemics? As plague, however, is a dis∣ease, by all accounts, of a very high degree of exhaustion, it may sometimes be necessary to go the length of, from fifteen to twenty grains of calomel, or even more, in repeated doses. The duration of the action of each dose, should re∣gulate their repetition; but that does not seem
<PB N="230" REF="033254_0221_0ff6aa2e64795378"/>
to be yet accurately ascertained. It appears, as far as I have been able to observe, that the in∣tervals, between the doses of mercury, ought not to be longer than two or three hours.—In exhi∣biting this medicine, it is a fact worthy of re∣mark, and deserves to be particularly remember∣ed when large doses are required, that by a sud∣den subduction of it, the patient is apt to have a very sore mouth, a violent salivation, and some∣times an alarming discharge of blood from the fauces. When any of these symptoms unex∣pectedly occur, it will be found, that the pati∣ent has suddenly left off his medicine, or has taken it in such an irregular manner, as to pro∣duce similar effects. This will often happen, from the imprudence of patients, in the hands of the most skilful physicians; but it perhaps more frequently occurs, from an ignorance of the fact. Although it has already been noticed in my "Treatise on the Action of Mercury," yet it appears proper to insist upon it, in a more particular manner, when that medicine is pro∣posed to be given in a disease, that will probably require its exhibition in unprecedented quanti∣ties. Suppose a case of plague to require the exhibition of a scruple of calomel every two or three hours, if it was suddenly left off, an alarm∣ing hemorrhagy would in most cases ensue. It would be of considerable advantage to the prac∣titioner, to know that this effect was produced
<PB N="231" REF="033254_0222_0ff6aa04a0ba24b0"/>
by the too sudden subduction of the high stimu∣lant power, which had been for some time pre∣viously applied to the body; and that it may be prevented by the regular exhibition and gradu∣al reduction; or removed by the re-application of the same power, or the substitution of others equivalent in force. Vicissitudes in the applica∣tion of substances, used in medicine, will pro∣duce disease, as well as vicissitudes in the state of the atmosphere, or in the force of any other ex∣citing power. But an application of the same powers, in a due degree, will remove the dis∣eases which an excessive or deficient application, or alterations in the force of them may have oc∣casioned.</P>
<P>THE terms excess and deficiency, in the ap∣plication of external powers to living bodies, do not relate to the sum of stimulus usually applied in a state of health, but to the state of the ex∣citability at the time.</P>
