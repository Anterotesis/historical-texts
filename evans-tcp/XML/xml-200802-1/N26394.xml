<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Publishers of the <HI>First American Edition</HI> of Ambrose and Eleanor, feel a pleasure in presenting to their Country, a work replete with originality and entertain∣ment; which, from the correctness of the style, the chastness of the ideas, and its con∣taining an interesting account of the life of Two Children, whose fortitude in adversity, and moderation in prosperity, peculiarly ad∣apts it for academies, schools, and private families, where it may serve the double pur∣pose of entertaining the elder, and instructing the younger branches.—Its also having been written by the author of a Visit of a Week, lately published in Philadelphia, we think, will be an additional recommendation to those who have read that pleasing and use∣ful performance.</P>

<P>A Clear sky, and prosperous gales, announced a happy voyage to the vessel in which Co∣lonel Carlton had embarked for England: it was returning from Jamaica, leaving on the left the Isle of Cuba, and on the right the superb forests of the ancient Bayti.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, so called <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI></NOTE> The pilot steered toward the Bermuda Isles; and the Colonel in a few weeks hoped to embrace a wife and child, endeared to him by an absence of twelve months; but these delightful prospects soon vanished; the rolling of the vessel encreased, a tremendous water-s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>out approached, and threatened instant destruction. This being, by the advice of the pilot, broken by a discharge of cannon, all that remained to be done was to lower the sails, shut <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>,
<PB N="6" REF="035098_0004_1000B5AEA256A258"/>
and abandon the vessel to the mercy of the waves. The Heavens were soon filled with flashes of light∣ning; thick darkness succeeded day; the thunder rolled, and the vessel, the sport of all the various revolutions of the boisterous waves, presented only to the unfortunate passengers shipwreck or death; this soon followed, for the point of a rock forcing an entrance into the vessel, in a few minutes, precipitated it into the bosom of the vast ocean. In this moment of danger, the Colonel, ever calm and collected, seized a plank, upon which he committed himself to the waves: his example was followed by a few others, and by his faithful domestic Peter.</P>
<P>Having long floated at random, and contended with the fury of the waves, the Colonel found himself near land; but such was the violence of the sea, that at the moment his hopes were strong∣est, he was frequently carried by an overwhelming wave to the greatest distance: at length, after va∣rious e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>orts, he gained a coast covered with rocks, over which he with difficulty climbed to an exten∣sive plain, where he sunk down, wholly deprived of sensation. In this state he remained nearly two hours, when his senses by degrees returning,
<PB N="7" REF="035098_0005_1000B5B16CDBB038"/>
he discovered two children, half-naked, on their knees, at his side, who, by their innocent gestures, expressed the most lively interest in his situation. One of them perceiving that he breathed, exclaim∣ed, in a jargon he could just distinguish to be Eng∣lish, "He is not dead, sister; he is come to take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s home—are you not father?"</P>
<P>His first questions were, "Where am I? What country do you inhabit?" But finding that he was not clearly understood, he looked round for some person to whom he might address himself. Not seeing any one, he attempted to rise; but ex∣hausted with fatigue, sunk down, uttering invo∣luntary sighs and groans, forced from him by the weakness of his condition.</P>
<P>"He is hungry, brother," said one of the chil∣dren, "I will go and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etch him some food;" and immediately she fled across the plain.</P>
<P>"Who do you belong to?" said the Colonel, recovering himself, "have you no friends? no father, no mother?"</P>
<P>"Are not you our father?" asked the boy.</P>
<P>"I! my child," said the Colonel, "I do not know you."</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="035098_0006_1000A3171881BE20"/>
"Will you not then love us?" said the child.</P>
<P>"Yes; but are you alone?"</P>
<P>"O yes," returned he, "we are all alone; nobody but Eleanor and Ambrose; we see only the great beasts, and they frighten us very much."</P>
<P>"And who brought you into this country, Am∣brose?" said the Colonel.</P>
<P>"A great house," replied the child, "that went <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on the water."</P>
<P>"And have you never seen one like it touch here?"</P>
<P>"O never," said the child; "there are only great men, all black, that come sometimes in little boats. When we see them we hide ourselves for sear they should eat us."</P>
<P>"Well!" said the Colonel with a sigh, "I am then lost without resource! I must end my days here, far from my wife, my friends, my country."</P>
<P>"You will stay with us, will you not?" said the boy.</P>
<P>"Alas, my child! I have no choice."</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="035098_0007_1000B5B397A3AA90"/>
"Oh," returned he, "we will love and caress you, as we used to do Derley."</P>
<P>"Derley! who was he?"</P>
<P>"Our good friend," answered the child; "but he is dead; we have wept a great deal for him." As he said this, his sister returned with some tor∣toise and colibri eggs; she brought also some dates and a large shell filled with a liquor, which to the taste seemed that which flows from the palm tree. This simple repast proved very salutary to the Colonel; his strength returned, he thanked his little hosts for their solicitude, and reflecting a-new upon his adventure was astonished to con∣ceive it possible that two children, so young and so delicate, should provide for all their wants at an age when others scarcely know how to walk or think: he wished to discover by what means it had been effected, but they expressed their ideas very imperfectly; he could only guess at their little jargon, and judge from it that they were English. He resolved, nevertheless, while he awaited the return of day, to interrogate them, that he might, from their answers, form some conjectures upon their condition, and the cause of
<PB N="10" REF="035098_0008_1000A31A59639688"/>
their being deserted at so early an age. "How old are you?" said he. "We do not understand you," replied Ambrose; but when he repeated, "I ask how many times you have seen the cold and hot seasons?" Eleanor said, "We cannot tell; but since the time our good friend died, we have at every sun made a mark with a stone on that great tree you see there. The Colonel ad∣mited the ingenious expedient the children had employed, and going toward the tree, by the light of the moon added all the marks, and counted 1528, which made four years two months and eight days since they had lost Derley. "But," said he, "did he die as soon as you came here?"</P>
<P>"O yes," replied the children, "his blood slowed like the spring at which we drink."</P>
<P>"He was wounded then?" said the Colonel.</P>
<P>"Very much," they replied.</P>
<P>"But," said the Colonel, "who brought you hither in the wooden house?"</P>
<P>"Mama, with a great many men; one of them was a very bad man; he beat Derley, and gave him a great many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uts with a knife, and
<PB N="11" REF="035098_0009_1000B5B52364E9C0"/>
then put him with us into a little boat that brought us here."</P>
<P>"And do you," said the Colonel, "recollect where you lived before you went into this ship? (for the wooden house you speak of is called a ship.)"</P>
<P>"Yes, in great houses, where there were many fine things; then we used to see our dear father sometimes, and he used to kiss and love us."</P>
<P>"And was your father in the ship?" said the Colonel.</P>
<P>"No; before we went into it, he and mama <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> very much; and then we saw him no more."</P>
<P>"In what place," said the Colonel, "was the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eat house in which you lived?"</P>
<P>"In a place where there were a great many others," replied Ambrose. "Do you remember, sister, that a woman used to carry us often into a fine garden, where there was a great river, and roads of trees, where fine women and men used to walk, while we played upon the grass with little girls and boys?"</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="035098_0010_1000B5B7E7C1A878"/>
"Yes," said Eleanor, "I remember it very well."</P>
<P>From these answers the Colonel could draw little information; all that he conjectured was that his little hosts were the victims of some sort of treachery, and that Derley was their friend; and he thought it possible that the fine garden of which they spoke might be St. James's Park; but all this was not sufficiently clear; he hoped that time, by strengthening their reason, would afford him a more satisfactory explanation.</P>
<P>No sooner had the morning sun inflamed the horizon, than he arose, and taking the young pu∣pils of Nature, who were henceforth to be his own, by the hand, set out to take a view of the land which Providence had destined, for some time at least, to be his abode. He discovered that it was an island, surrounded by steep rocks, and ac∣cessible only on one side to vessels; it was not very extensive, but was covered with mountains, woods, little hills, and cool and fragrant valleys; here an embowering sorest invited the traveller to taste in its religious inclosure the sweets of solitude: there a mountain slowly rising, covered with fern, discovered from its top an extensive ocean, strewed
<PB N="13" REF="035098_0011_1000A3222A6516A0"/>
with an infinity of little islands, which appeared only like the points of so many rocks. Farther on a spring of water escaped trembling from the hollow of a cave, and ran meandering over beds of reeds to water a smiling plain, enamelled with all the various beauties of vegetation. A thousand succulent vegetables and blooming flowers, a thou∣sand fruits and odoriferous trees, contended for the shade and land; the cocoa, the casia, the palm and the banana tree, the leaves of which were, according to the Indians, the vestments of our first parents; the fig, the white cotton tree, in a word, all the most curious and useful productions of America. No traces of men were, however, vi∣sible, but those of different animals, such as otters, flags, goats, and the anta, a small animal which resembles the elephant, though much smal∣ler, and is common to Peru. Among the birds was the sou, a little inoffensive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owl, which has the habit of clinging to the masts of vessels; the Edolio, so called from its repeating, without ceas∣ing, in a low melancholy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one, '<HI>edolio;</HI> and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, a bird of an exquisite flavour.</P>
<P>"Well," said Ambrose, having led the Colo∣nel over the island, "do you find all this so fright∣ful?
<PB N="14" REF="035098_0012_1000B5B96DDF2230"/>
Eleanor and I sleep when it is no longer light, and when the sun shines, we run into the woods to seek food. We throw stones at the high trees, and the fruits fall, and we eat them."</P>
<P>"But you had not always strength to do so," said the Colonel.</P>
<P>"No," replied Eleanor, "it is only since the dry weather that Ambrose thought of it. O me! before we were not tall enough, and we only eat the fruits that the trees let fall, or some eggs that the great fish brought to the side of the water: but we are near our cabin; come, in father, you shall see it; take care you do not hurt your head." It was' a kind of subterraneous cave, at which the arrived through a deep valley, overgrown with palm-trees. The Colonel readily entered; but was instantly alarmed by a faeted smell, that nearly stifled him: he advanced to discover the cause; but what was his horror and astonishment, when, at the further part of the cave, he saw a disfigured corpse! it was partly dry, and partly putrified and was covered with different aromatic leaves "Do not be freightened," said Eleanor, observ∣ing the impression it made upon the Colonel, "it is he!"</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="035098_0013_1000B5BB1B223E48"/>
"He! my child, who!" "Poor Derley," she replied, "who fell dead in this corner."—"And have you, my children," said the Colonel, "inhabited a cavern where—" "Oh, we never left it," interrupted Eleanor, "that we might be always with him." "Yes," said Ambrose, "we look at him every sun, and cover him with fresh leaves." "Good creatures!" exclaimed the Co∣lonel; "but, my little friends, he can no longer hear you." "Oh! we know very well," said Ambrose, "that he cannot hear us; for if he could, he would speak to us, but we would not part with him for all that." "But, my dear chil∣dren," said the Colonel, "you expose yourselves to the danger of becoming sick, and dying like∣wise."</P>
<P>"Ah," said Ambrose, having remained thought∣ful a moment, "once as we were looking at Der∣ley, Eleanor's face turned quite white, and she fell upon the ground. I thought she was going to die; for I called, and she did not answer me; Eleanor I said, my dear Eleanor, will you leave Ambrose all alone? but she did not speak. Then I turned to the Sun, and begged he would give me back Eleanor, or burn me with his fire. He heard me, for she got up and walked."</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="035098_0014_1000B5BD996ACA48"/>
"Not the Sun, my child," said the Colonel, but God heard you."</P>
<P>"God! who is God?" "That Great Being, my child," said the Colonel, "who has placed you upon the earth; who watches over you, who has miraculously preserved your life: but I shall ex∣plain this hereafter, at present we must think of tak∣ing hence this inanimate corpse."</P>
<P>"Oh, no," exclaimed the children at the same instant. "Suffer me to remove it," said the Colo∣nel, "I know where God would have it put."</P>
<P>"Pray, pray," said Eleanor, holding her little hands towards him, "do not take it away: we shall die if we do not see poor Derley."</P>
<P>By dint of argument and entreaty, the Colonel, however, at length prevailed; he drew from them a reluctant consent, and drawing the corpse of the unfortunate Derley from the cavern, he began to examine it, hoping to form from it some conclusions relative to the fate of the two little strangers. Dis∣figured as it was, it appeared to be that of a man about thirty years of age, tall and well ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e: his cloaths, upon being touched, fell into rags; but the Colonel picked up a watch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et with dia∣monds,
<PB N="17" REF="035098_0015_1000B5BFC1126230"/>
and a gold snuff-box, in the inside of which was set the portrait of a woman: the damp had al∣most wholly defaced it, but it was easy to distinguish that the principal features were handsome. The box, he observed also, had a double bottom, in which he found a letter, which he opened precipitately, but it was so macerated, that among others entirely defaced, he could only distinguish the following words—</P>

<P>Finding nothing more upon the corpse, except∣ing some guireas, a kni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, scissars, and a pocket∣book absolutely in ashes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e resolved to inter it. "But," said he to the children, who, with eyes bathed in tears, and fixed upon Derley, seemed buried in the most profound apathy, "how was it that you did not touch the jewels your unfortunate friend possessed?" "Oh," they replied, "we
<PB N="18" REF="035098_0016_1000A30CF4CE18D0"/>
loved him too much to take any thing from him, and then we did not know he had all these pretty things."</P>
<P>"You have never then searched him?" said the Colonel."</P>
<P>"Never," said Ambrose, "we only looked at him and then wept."</P>
<P>"What respectful tenderness!" exclaimed the Co∣lonel. His thoughts then reverted to the interment of the corpse. He had observed in an adjacent vale, a little mount which rose covered with myrrh trees, and overshaded by four palms. To this spot he im∣mediately repaired, and having with a branch of the Bischalo, the hard wood of which the negroes use for the construction of their cabins, dug a grave, he deposited in it the remains of the unfortunate Derley, while his two little friends beheld the mournful ceremony bathed in tears.</P>
<P>He then struck fire from a neighbouring rock, a wonder which much surprised the children, and burnt upon the grave the clothes of the deceased, adding a quantity of mint, cloves, and other fragrant herbs that grew near, to purify the air. Ambrose and Eleanor could not depart without casting many a
<PB N="19" REF="035098_0017_1000B5C1478742E8"/>
lingering glance towards a spot which contained in their eyes an inestimable treasure. They walked—stopped—walked—and would again retrace the same steps to bid an eternal adieu to their good friend.</P>
<P>In the mean while t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e sun inclined toward the West, and the sea, as they ascended the valley, re∣flecting his crimson rays, appeared a vast plain of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire. Arriving on the shore, the Colonel stopped to admire the glories of the scene, and the children, forgetting their grief, walked hand in hand toward the rocks, and amused themselves with collecting shells and sea-weeds. For some minutes the Colo∣nel lost sight of them, but Eleanor soon returned out of breath, to t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll him that her brother and she had discovered a great thing which they believed to be a fish. "Come and see it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ather," said she; "it is dead, so do not be afraid." Saying this, she led him among the rocks, where they found Am∣brose attentively examining something which the Colonel soon discovered to be a large bundle of ham∣mocks which the returning tide had driven on shore. This suggesting to him the idea of recovering from the wreck some articles that might soften the severity of his misfortune, an idea which had not till this moment occurred to him, he began to search diligent∣ly
<PB N="20" REF="035098_0018_1000A32A4B4D7E60"/>
among the rocks, and with inexpressible joy, dis¦covered two large chests, three small casks of brandy, and some tubs of salt provision, besides several copper utensils and other articles. These treasures were by degrees conveyed from the rocks, and de∣posited i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> a subterraneous cave which the children pointed out. The Colonel then impatient to exa∣mine the contents of the chests, forced one of them open, and found in it several suits of clothes, a quantity of shirts, stockings, handkerchiefs, and some gold and jewels. The other which was the carpenter's chest, contained a variety of different tools, and was considered by the Colonel as a greater treasure than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll the rest.</P>
<P>The fatigues of the day at length rendering rest and refreshment necessary, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e kindled a fire, and roasted some pieces of salt meat. Then seating himself with his young companions on the sea beech, he shared with them a meal of which hunger made the chief dainty: and he was not a little diverted to see them, with sparkling eyes, palate the flavor of meats, the relish of which they had long lost, and tenderly incite each other to partake of a feast which to them appeared delicious.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="035098_0019_1000A33C247EE540"/>
"You do not eat, brother," said Eleanor; "nor you, sister," returned Ambrose; and then they both fell greedily upon their meats, which presently dis∣appeared. Their good friend smiled; and congra∣tulated himself upon the power of contributing to their happiness. The repast being ended, they all three repaired to the cavern where Ambrose and Eleanor soon sell asleep. It was not so with their friend: a thousand painful reflections kept him long from tasting the same refreshment. He could not forbear contrasting his situation and prospects the preceeding day with those of the present moment. What a change had a few hours wrought! Flushed with hope he was returning to his country to enjoy with a wife and child whom he tenderly loved, all the conveniencies and the elegancies of life. He now saw himself the solitary inhabitant of an unfre∣quented tract, obliged to renounce his wife, his friends, all he held dear. These reflections, in spite of his fortitude, bedewed his cheek with tears; but when he c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lled to mind the dangers from which he had escaped, that his life, among numbers the waves had swallowed, had been preserved, be ac∣knowledged the goodness of the Being who had pro∣tected him, and with chearfulness and resignation
<PB N="22" REF="035098_0020_1000B5C2CD5CD660"/>
committed his fate into his hands. His thoughts then turned upon his little companions in whose f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te it was impossible not to be interested, abandoned to themselves on an uninhabited island, at the early age of three years and a half; for the marks upon the great tree forming four years two months and eight days, the whole amounted to no more than seven years, two months and eight days. Their preser∣vation, he thought, could have been effected by lit∣tle less than a miracle, and viewing them as the ob∣jects signally pointed at by Providence in his ship∣wreck, he resolved henceforth to be to them a fa∣ther, guide, and friend.</P>
<P>The rising sun awoke him from a short repose, and he looked round to salute his fellow-citizens; but he was surprised to find that they had left the cave: at first he concluded they would soon return, but an hour nearly elapsing, he grew alarmed and having sought them without success in the cave they had formerly inhabited, he repaired to the sea-shore which he traversed in the utmost anxiety, calling them repeatedly by name. He knew not what to think, and began to form a thousand horrid conjec∣tures concerning wild beasts, that for any thing he knew to the contrary, might inhabit the island,
<PB N="23" REF="035098_0021_1000A332181E1280"/>
when the idea occurred to him that they might be at the place where Derley was interred. To this spot their affectionate hearts had in truth conducted them; he met them returning through the wood, their eyes still wet with the tears they had shed upon the grave of their friend. The Colonel chid them gently for the alarm they caused him, and taking them by the hand, "I am pleased my little friends," said he, as they walked through the wood, "with the gratidude and affection you discover towards your unfortunate good friend; it convinces me that your hearts are good; nevertheless you must cease to regret him; God has, I doubt not, taken him from you to bellow on him a happiness that nothing can interrupt.</P>
<P>"How is that, father?" said the children, "we do not understand you."</P>
<P>"I will explain it to you, my little friends," said the Colonel, "I ought to do so, but necessity engages me at present to defer this duty. We can∣not inhabit the gloomy cave we now occupy; we must endeavor to construct a more agreeable re∣treat; a cabin that will shelter us from the injuries of the air, and serve us as an asylum against all alarms. The children were delighted; they jumpt
<PB N="24" REF="035098_0022_1000B5C4543FB740"/>
round their good friend, exclaiming in an extacy, "We will help you, father! we will help you!' He resolved, however, before he began his opera∣tions, to visit the rocks, judging that the influx of the tide might, during the night, have brought other articles from the wreck on shore. Nor was he de∣ceived; he found a cask of oil, a second <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of salt provisions, and a chest containing, besides linen, a variety of books, among which were some of the best Latin and English authors. It contained also a case of mathematical instruments, and a small mariner<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s compass. The books were dama∣ged by the wet, but he hoped soon to dry and ren∣der them fit for use. Besi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, these he found seve∣ral other articles scattered along the shore.</P>
<P>Having secured these new treasures, he turned his thoughts upon the grand work of constructing a cabin, between two hills that rose near the sea coast, was a cool valley, in the midst of which a spring of water, gushing from a rock, formed a ba∣sin, bordered with a thousand odoriferous flowers. This valley was shaded by palm-trees, and exposed to the rising sun, was a stranger to the burning heats of noon. It o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ered an agreeable retreat to the philo∣sopher, and was on one side bounded by the whole

extent of the ocean, and on the other by an embow∣ring forest. Here, at the entrance of the forest, the colonel resolved to erect his new habitation, and with this design collecting the precious instruments he had taken from the wreck, hewed two of those trees called Bischalos, and shaped four stakes fifteen inches thick, and eight long; these he drove into the earth at the distance of twenty feet from each other, planting between each six smaller: this done, he filled the intermediate space with flints, cementing the whole with a whitish sort of earth, very much resembling that in Europe called marne, and which mixed with water formed a cement to which the rays of the sun soon gave a hardness equal to stone. He did not forget previously to leave in this little edifice a door, narrow, that he and his companions might the better defend themselves, in case of an attack, against the wild beasts. A large chimney was also formed, and two windows to establish a current of air necessary in so confined a place occupied by three persons. The l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>teral parts thus finished, a covering was next to be thought of, and this did not a little puzzle our architect, who having neither tiles nor the tools necessary to saw planks, was embarrassed how to defend his house against the rain and hail, the size of which is prodigious in North America.

length, &amp;c;cedil;alling to mind the manner in which the Africans roof their dwellings, he placed seven or eight joists horizontally upon the building, and then having raised others into a point, he formed the whole into a carcass, with tenons and mortices, and covered it with the leaves of the palm-tree in∣terwoven into a sort of mat, in the manner of the negroes on the gold coast: he next made a partition, which separated the interior of the cabin into two parts, and formed for Eleanor a little chamber, about eight feet square, the entrance of which com∣municated with that which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e designed for himself and Ambrose. Three stools and a billet, serving for a table, were next produced; also some plates, spoons, and drinking cups, made with the leaves of a tree called the Balizeir, which are used by the natives of Madagascar for the covering of their houses, and which, if well dried, will remain, it is said, undecayed five or six years. It is impossible to describe the zeal and activity of the Colo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el; al∣ternately carpenter, mason, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and joiner, he pursued his operations with a degree of vigour and perseve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nce that removed every obstacle. Am∣brose and Eleanor, on the other hand, assisted him as much as their strength would permit; they went

in search of the earth of which their cement was formed, moistened it, presented the tools, carried away the chips, gathered the palm leaves (for they climbed the highest trees with the greatest agility) joined them together under the conduct of their friend; in a word, united all their endeavours to alleviate his fatigue, and accomplish a work of which they felt, as he did, all the utility. At the end of a month the little edifice was completed, and all that he had gained from the wreck, chests, tools, linen, clothes, &amp;c. conveyed into it: as for beds, he made three very commodious of some hammocks, spread with mats composed of palm leaves dried in the sun. The chimney concealed his kitchen utensils, which were hung upon hooks, driven into the wall for that purpose: in short, every thing was complete, and the Colonel and his little friends took possession of their new habitation. The children knew not how to express their joy; they ran, wept, laughed, examined <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll, and leaping by turns on the neck of their friend, called him repeat∣edly their father, their de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Carlton, for he had taught them to express his name: then, suddenly quitting him, they re-examined all, seated them∣selves twenty times upon the benches, touched, and
<PB N="23" REF="035098_0026_1000A3339AB72C20"/>
removed all the furniture, and then returning, again threw themselves into his arms. The Colonel made them, at length, sit down, recommended silence, and spoke to them in these terms. "It is time, my children that I think of the great work to which God has appointed me; that of your education: the forming of your hearts will not, I think, cost me much trouble; they are good and susceptible: with respect to your intellects, I believe them to be sound and comprehensive, but I shall form a better judg∣ment when I am more particularly acquainted with the manner in which you have conducted yourselves since your residence in this island: it is necessary, therefore, Ambrose, before I detail to you my plans, that you recount to me in the most exact manner that your memory will permit, what you did upon first coming out of the ship that brought you hither, and acquaint me with the means you have employed since that time to preserve your exist∣ence, and to provide for all your wants: arrange your ideas, my child, as well as you are able, and do not omit the most trivial circumstance; the de∣tail will be more interesting to me than you may suppose."</P>
<P>The Colonel ceased, and Ambrose, who du∣ring
<PB N="29" REF="035098_0027_1000B5CBCB20C140"/>
a month had learned to reflect a little, and to express his ideas in a more intelligent manner, was silent a few minutes to recollect himself, and then gave, without interruption, the following re∣cital.</P>
<P>"We lived, as we told you, father; in a wood∣en house that went upon the water: we had slept in it a great many times, and every morning Der∣ley used to come and take us up, and carry us to mama, who used to kiss us and cry, this made us cry too. Once as she was kissing us and crying, a man came into the cabin, and talked a great deal to her: it was that naughty man I told you of: mama cried very much, and would have taken us in her arms, but he took us away from her and threw us upon the ground. Then Derley was very angry, and seized that naughty man by the throat, but he drew a very long great knife, and run it into his belly. Then several ugly men came in, and put us and Derley into a little boat, that went upon the water much faster than the wooden house. Der∣ley groaned very much, and we were all covered with his blood; but the men in the boat laughed, and set us all three upon this land, father. Then
<PB N="30" REF="035098_0028_1000A337056B2560"/>
Derley fell down, and lay along time upon the ground: at last he got up very softly, and took us by the hand, and walked to the cave, where you know we lived, father, till you came; but as soon as he got in he fell down again, and dragged us upon him. We cried, and spoke to him, but he did not answer, he only groaned. He groaned all night, and we cried, and when the sun came again, he breathed no more. We took him by the hands, but they were quite cold; then we spoke to him again, but finding he did not answer, we went out of the cave, crying, and running about up on the sea-shore. Eleanor soon fell down; I ran to her, and fell too, for I felt as if I was going to fall asleep. While we were sitting, a goat passed by with a young one sacking: at that moment it came into my mind to drive away the young one, and suck some of the milk; so drawing myself under the goat, the good creature let me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as much as I would, without going away or hurting me. This g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve me strength; I got u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and led her to Eleanor, who sucked some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> milk, smiled, held out her hand to me, and got up; but the go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t was going away, and we were afraid she would not come back to us. "What shall we do:" said I to Eleanor. "Let us lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="31" REF="035098_0029_1000B5CDEEA7A638"/>
to Derley," she replied: so we took her by the horn, and led her to the cave, the young one follow∣ing all the way. Still Derley did not speak, so we began again to cry, and call him: Derley!!' we said, "Derley, speak to us, are you angry? we will do so no more. Answer us, Derley, it is Ambrose, it is Eleanor; do you not love us?" Our uneasiness encreased every instant, we were so happy with mama! and now we were in a frightful cave, all dark! This made us on a sudden thought∣ful; we ceased crying, and looked at each other, without speaking or stirring at all. In this time we forgot our goat, till seeing she was gone, we run out of the cave to seek her. In our way something fell from a hightree as we passed it, and frightened us very much; we ran away as fast as we could, but at last venturing to look back, and seeing nothing to alarm us, we returned on tip toe, to see what had fallen from the tree, and found a fruit shaped like a very large green pear: I was so hungry, that I could not help tasting it, and found that it was very good: so I gave it to Eleanor, who eat half, and left me the rest. We then went again in search of the goat, but seeing as we passed, a great tree that water came out of it, being very dry, I put my mouth to the tree, and sucked some. Eleanor did
<PB N="32" REF="035098_0030_1000A33AA0FCFDF8"/>
the same, and we both thought it was much better than the water we had before drank. At last, think∣ing we should not find the gentle beast which had gi∣ven us her milk, we went back to the cave, which we were a long time in finding. The sight of our good friend made us again cry very much, till no longer seeing any light, we fell upon the ground, and slept till a new sun. When we awoke, we kissed Derley, and being very hungry, ran to the tree at the foot of which we had found the great pear; but there were no pears; so we run to the sea-shore, crying, and repeating the prayers mama used to make us say morning and night. "O, Eleanor, do you remember how frightened we were!" There was a great beast upon the sands, just like a spider; Eleanor, who saw it first, scream∣ed out, and taking me by the hand, ran to our cave, where we hid ourselves; for we thought the great beast was coming after us. We staid there till the heat of the day, crying and screaming dreadfully; but finding it did not follow us, we grew calm, and I began to think of the great pear which had frightened us, and afterwards proved so good: so I said to Eleanor, "Let us go and see if the great beast is there." "Ah!" she replied, "it will eat us." "No," said I, "if it wants to eat us, I
<PB N="33" REF="035098_0031_1000B5D016611870"/>
will throw a great stone, and kill it."—Eleanor consented, and we went softly to the place where we had seen it, and in its room found several yellow eggs. We did not much like the looks of them, but I was so hungry, that I soon took courage to break one, and Eleanor and I swallowed them one after another, and found them nicer than the eggs we had eaten with mama. It was very lucky, father, that we found them, for we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as if we should fall and die for want of food; but after we had eaten the eggs we grew strong again, and began to speak of what had happened to us. Still we called upon Derley, hoping in time to awake him, and at last got so weary and sick, that we lay ourselves down to sleep till another sun. This too we spent in crying, and seeking food. A very pretty little bird, with a∣long be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k, and black and blue f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ers, let its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est fall from a tree, and we found in it some eggs, whole and broken, but much smaller, and more yellow than those which the great beast had left on the sands. We divided them, and at the same time, I saw ly∣ing on the ground two of the same large apples which had before f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llen from the tree. "Here, sister," said I, "is one for you and one for me." We ate them, and then went to the tree which gave
<PB N="34" REF="035098_0032_1000B5D19C573FC0"/>
the water, and sucked till we were no longer dry. In this manner, father, we lived for several suns, and were only sorrowful when we entered the cave where poor Derley continued to sleep without speak∣ing: still we hoped he would wake, and a thought one sun came into my head, as we stood on the sea∣shore, looking at the great fire which shines in the heavens. "What shall we do, sister," said I, "to count the suns Derley shall have slept, that we may tell him when he awakes?" We both thought a good while; but at last, Eleanor took a flint, and said, "Let us make a stroke upon this great tree every time the sun comes back to us; Derley knows how to read, and he will tell when he awakes." Since that time we have not passed one sun without mak∣ing a stroke on the tree; you have read them, father, and know how many there be."</P>
<P>Here the Colonel could no longer retain his admi∣ration: he embraced his two little friends, addressed some exclamations to heaven, and desired Ambrose to continue his recital, which he did in these words.—</P>
<P>"We every day found food, and began to forget our griefs, when I thought to myself, if these trees should not let fall any more apples, nor these birds
<PB N="35" REF="035098_0033_1000A33F2DFCC038"/>
their nests; if those great beasts should not bring us any more eggs, what must we do? We must try to get something to eat, if all this should happen. Then I took some stones, and threw them with all my strengh at the trees, and a great many apples and nests fell at our feet. Eleanor and I gathered them up, and carried them to the cave, where we hid them under some leaves of the same trees, which are very large. We did this every sun, and were never in want of food; but sometimes we were very much frightened indeed! for those great beasts you have seen, father, in the woods, would come by night almost into our cave; but we always hid ourselves behind Derley, and they went away without biting us. One night there came a horse that had a long neck, and a great lump upon its back; the sight of it frightened us so much, that we fled out of the cave, and ran screaming violently, till coming to a tree, I set my feet and hands against it, and grasping it it very close, climbed quite to the top, calling to my sister to do the same. She followed my exam∣ple, and the crooked horse finding he could not get at us, went away directly, and when he was a good way off, we came down. Ah, father, we should have been very glad, if we had known the secret
<PB N="36" REF="035098_0034_1000A37CF3374848"/>
you have shewn us, of getting fire out of the stones, for we were sometimes cold. Our clothes got torn, and when they were very bad, we threw them away, and for some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s remained quite naked; but at last, we found the skin of a beast, which we divided be∣tween us: here it is still; what do you call it?"</P>
<P>"It is the skin of an otter," replied the Colo∣nel. "Well, then," continued Ambrose, "this country is full of these otters. We will try to get a skin for you when your coat is worn out.</P>
<P>"Is this all that has happened, Ambrose?" said the Colonel. "Yes," said Ambrose, "all."—"But," returned the Colonel, "you have not yet spoken of the large black men you saw." "Oh," said Ambrose, "I forgot: in truth, we must take care of them." "Well," said the Colonel, "but how came you to see them?" "Why," said Am∣brose, "one day when it was very bad weather, I left Eleanor in the cave, and went out to seek food, and when I came back, she came running to me, quite frightened, crying, "we shall be eaten,—we shall be eaten—I have seen—" I asked her what? "Great ugly black men," said she, "there—look—do you not see them?"—While she was speaking, I saw a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar of a great many black men,
<PB N="37" REF="035098_0035_1000A349C9534C70"/>
running one after the other. I directly let f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll all that I had brought, and taking my sister by the hand, we both ran to a dark cave that is under ground: if you stand where I do, father, you may see it: there, on that side where the sun appears: we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id ourselves at the bottom of it, very much terrified; but not hearing any thing, came out from time to time, to see if the black men were still there: at last we did not see them at all, and running to the side from whence they came, we saw them a very great way off, in a little boat that went very fast upon the water. They have been here since, but we saw no more of them than we did at first; they never come this way, it is only in the great gardens which you call woods, that we see them; when they are gone, we find large large animals there skinned, trees quite destroyed, and the feathers of birds, which makes us think that these black men come here to kill the beasts, and to take the birds and ap∣ples. This, father, is all I can recollect: we have lived, as I have told you, from the time you see the marks upon the tree, without doubt, through the goodness of the God whom you tell us of: till now we have said the prayers mama taught us to the sun, who walks in the heavens, thinking he was
<PB N="38" REF="035098_0036_1000B5D356FD6428"/>
God; but if you have another, we will pray to him, and be very good, that he may love us."</P>
<P>Ambrose ceased speaking, and the Colonel was silent a few minutes, to admire the hand of Provi∣dence in the preservation of these innocents! The green pears of which they spoke, he found no diffi∣culty in judging to be Carasols, a fruit common to North America; the great beast on the shore a tor∣toise, the eggs of which are delicious, and common∣ly deposited by this creature on the sands: the bird with black and blue feathers, he deter∣mined to be the colib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i, and the water which flowed from the great tree, the sap of the palm; but more especially did he acknowledge an over-ruling Providence in the succour they had re∣ceived from the goat: he had read of bears, and even lionesses, having suckled infants, but till now had justly considered such stories as fabulous. At length, taking Ambrose by the hand, "The desire you express, my son," said he, "of knowing that powerful and beneficent Being, who has miracu∣lously preserved you amidst these deserts, shall be gratified: too great to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ender himself visible to his weak creatures, know, my child, that, from the height of Heaven, he watches over the conduct of
<PB N="39" REF="035098_0037_1000B5D643909900"/>
all men: nothing escapes him, he knows all, sees all, hears all, and with a glance of his eye, com∣prehends the whole earth." "The earth!" inter∣rupted Ambrose, "do you mean the country where we live?" "The earth, my children, I need not tell you," said the Colonel, "is the ground on which we tread, but it consists not only of this island, it extends beyond the seas, and contains four great countries, which are called EUROPE, ASIA, AFRICA, and AMERICA, which last is the part of the world we are now in."</P>
<P>"Then this Island," said Ambrose, "is Ame∣rica?"</P>
<P>"No," replied the Colonel," but it makes a part of it."</P>
<P>"We do not," said the children, "understand you." "When you are further instructed," said the Colonel, "when I shall have taught you to read and write, you will perfectly comprehend all this: at present it will be sufficient to acquaint you that this great Being, who is called God, created all things: the Sun, which has hitherto been the object of your adoration, and which communicates light and heat to all nature, was formed by his
<PB N="40" REF="035098_0038_1000B5D7C94D0EC8"/>
word: he has furnished the earth with thousands of beautiful plants and animals: we can behold no∣thing that does not speak his praise and almighty power: to him, my children, you owe your be∣ing: his word called you into existence, and his mercy renders that existence a blessing: you must look up to him as the author of all good, and to please him, be humble, meek, and endeavour to imitate his perfections, by diffusing happiness to every creature around you."</P>
<P>Ambrose and Eleanor listened to this discourse with an attention from which their friend drew the happiest presage: the day passed insensibly away; they supped in the new cabin, and afterward pre∣pared to occupy their hammocks. Eleanor busied herself for some time about her chamber: she walked in it a great while, and did not go to sleep till she had twenty times examined and changed the place of the little furniture it contained. The Colonel and Ambrose, neighbours to each other, discoursed for some time: then resigning themselves to the pow∣ers of sleep, they enjoyed an uninterrupted repose. The rising sun at length enlightened the cabin, when the Colonel, finding that his pupils were still bu∣ried in a profound sleep, took them gently by the
<PB N="41" REF="035098_0039_1000B5D94F86C310"/>
hand, and with pleasure saw them open their eyes, stretch first one arm, then the other, raise their heads, and smile on him with an inexpressible grace. "You should give an example to your sister, Am∣brose," said he, "and be before hand with the Sun." "Forgive me, dear father," said Ambrose, but we have slept in such a good bed!"</P>
<P>"It is enough, my son," replied the Colonel, "but to-morrow, and every future day, you must at day-break repair both of you to the sea shore, and o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er your thanks and prayers to the Being who has preserved you during the night." This the chil∣dren assured him they would not fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of doing.</P>
<P>Having erected and furnished his little dwelling, the Colonel was resolved to visit the interior part of the Island, that he might more particularly examine its vegetable productions, and execute the projects he had formed: he accordingly set out, and had not advanced far before he discovered plains covered with rice and maize, and manioque. These were the principal objects of his pursuit: with the assist∣ance of the children, about two bushels of maize was gathered, and conveyed in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the cabin. Some handfuls of this was spread upon the
<PB N="42" REF="035098_0040_1000B5DB09854568"/>
turf, and exposed to the scorching heat of noon, which soon dried it sufficiently to grind. The Colo∣nel then made, in a rock, a hole in the form of a mortar, and with a pestle of wood broke the grains, and reduced them to powder, It was then neces∣sary to winnow it, that the chaff might be separated from the grain, and this he performed by shaking it violently in a cloth, which Ambrose and Eleanor held extended: afterwards it was ground into flour between two stones, and diluted with water. A little brandy being mixed with this paste, by way of leven, it was put to bake upon flints strongly heated by the fire, and thus a bread, very light and agreeable to the palate, was made. While the chil∣dren watched the bread, the Colonel returned to make fresh discoveries: he found, as he proceeded into the island, a great deal of millet, but different from that of Europe, and fine potatoes, which he knew would afford them excellent nourishment; he discovered also some green figs, and a variety of wholesome and delicious fruits common to America; but for these it was necessary to go far into the island, which became an inconvenience: to remedy it, therefore, with the assistance of his little pupils, he dug up and sowed a piece of land, near the cabin,
<PB N="43" REF="035098_0041_1000A34E52167670"/>
which extended from the sea shore to the forest, which served as its boundary. This sort of orchard in the end, furnished them with maize, rice, millet, pota∣toes, and all the most useful and delicious productions of the soil.</P>
<P>The Reader having now seen our islanders fur∣nished with the first necessaries of life, will not, perhaps be displeased to learn in what manner they employed their time. In the morning the Colonel took Ambrose into the woods with him to hunt, having for this necessary purpose fabricated a bow about three feet and a half long, the string of which was a gut twisted, and the arrows a stick furnished with two feathers, and terminated by a flint sharp∣ened: with these they killed the different animals that inhabited the woods, such as stags, goats, does, and among the birds, the duck and the foken, which furnished them with excellent food. Du∣ring this time Eleanor was employed in baking the bread, or in other little offices of domestic econo∣my. On returning, they busied themselves in col∣lecting the eggs which were deposited by different fish upon the sea beach, but especially by the tor∣toise and alligator: the last mentioned is so singular that a short description of it may be deserving the
<PB N="44" REF="035098_0042_1000B5DDE9CB47A0"/>
attention of the Reader. The alligator is a sort of crocodile common to America: its head is large, and its jaws furnished with strong teeth, two of which especially are extremely long; it has four legs, which are very short, and terminate by large feet, and its back from the head to the tail is cover∣ed with strong scales, as also two large lumps which are over the eyes; its stomach is furnished with four glands, and its tail always drags on the ground. This animal lives indifferently on land or water, and is not mischievous but when provoked: its eggs are esteemed a great dainty. The cultivation of their field next engaged the attention of the Colonel and his pupils, after which they dined, and spent the afternoon in study or in gardening.</P>
<P>Nothing could exceed the attention of Ambrose and Eleanor to the lessons of their friend, who had found the means of teaching them, not only to read, but to write. He had discovered in the woods a tree much resembling the fimpi of the Isle of Ma∣dagascar: its bark, after being exposed to the sun, became as white as paper, and though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t smelt a lit∣tle of musk, this was easily weakened by exposing it to the fumes of aromatic herbs: at the foot of this flowed a sort of gum, much like that of the
<PB N="45" REF="035098_0043_1000A3519691E0B8"/>
Indian fig-tree, the sap of which is used by the In∣dians to colour their vessels black. Being thus fur∣nished with paper and ink, he soon added pens; he shaped them with his knife, and put them into the hands of his young pupils, who were soon able to write and read, and consequently to feel the value of those books (for among them were some of the best authors) which had been taken from the wreck. "Pray, father," said Ambrose one day, laying down a book, "explain to me why they have kings in the countries I read of." "Men living in so∣ciety, my son," said the Colonel, "in which there are good and bad, it is necessary to establish rulers, that order and peace may be maintained."</P>
<P>"I do not understand you," said Ambrose.—"I will endeavor," replied his friend, to ex∣plain myself more clearly; suppose, now, for ex∣ample, there were in this island a great many men and women who lived together in common, can you not conceive that one would wish for the field of his neighbour, that another would cut the throat of his enemy without pity; that this man would enter our cabin to seize upon our food, and that drive us from it to establish his own residence in it?</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="035098_0044_1000B5DF6F941590"/>
"How!' exclaimed the children with astonish∣ment, "are men capable of this?'</P>
<P>"I am ashamed, my children," said the Colonel, to reply that they are; and that, unfortunately, the number of the wicked surpass that of the good." "Ah, Eleanor," exclaimed Ambrose, "let us stay in our isle!"</P>
<P>"Hear me to an end," interrupted the Colonel; "what I have said granted, you will see that it is ne∣cessary to establish laws to render our habitations and property secure, and also to invest certain indi∣viduals with a power to enforce those laws: this power is not, however, always invested in one man, but sometimes in a certain number chosen by the body of the people; this form of government is called a republic; the other, where a king governs, a monarchy."</P>
<P>"I comprehend very well what you say, father," said Ambrose, but is it not strange that men should be so wicked as to render these laws necessary?</P>
<P>"It is a melancholy proof, my son," replied the Colonel, "of the depravity of human nature: from pride, envy, ambition, and avarice, vices, which are the more dangerous in community, as opportunities
<PB N="47" REF="035098_0045_1000A354A56B6050"/>

<P>"Pray, father, said Ambrose, "what is ava∣rice?"</P>
<P>"An inordinate desire of possessing more than we can enjoy," said the Colonel: "you will scarcely believe, my child, that there are beings who possess great wealth, and bury, without employing it."</P>
<P>"In what, then," said Ambrose, consists the riches of your country, father?"</P>
<P>"Alas, my son!" returned the Colonel, "it is those miserable pieces of gold and silver which con∣stitute all the happine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and misery of life."</P>
<P>"What! those," exclaimed the children, "that you found upon Derley?</P>
<P>"The same," replied the Colonel; those pieces stamped with the image of the ruling power are divi∣ded into small and great coin, each of a proportion∣ate value, and with these are procured all the com∣modities of life."</P>
<P>"What," said Eleanor, do men agree to pay one another for things that belong alike to every one? I do not understand—"</P>

"Oh, I understand very well,' interrupted Am∣brose, and I could willingly pardon them for selling the works of art; if one man is wiser or more skil∣ful than another, he deserves a recompence: but to assume a right over grain, wood, and all the common productions of the earth, that is indeed unrea∣sonable."</P>
<P>"You do not reflect, Ambrose," said the Colo∣nel, "that all these productions of the earth require culture, conveyance, and a thousand little cares which equally deserve reward: is the man who tills a field, sows it, and watches the vegetation of its produce, who gathers and carries it afterward into cities, obliged to take upon himself this trouble? No, surely: if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e consider gold an equivalent, has he not a right to receive it?

<P>"Your observation, my dear father," said Am∣brose, "is very just; I did not consider.'</P>
<P>In this manner the Colonel endeavoured to inform the minds, and rectify the judgment of his young pu∣pils: towards sun-set, they were at liberty to run,

One even∣ing when the sky was clear, and strewed with s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s, Eleanor observed that phenomenon which we gene∣rally express un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er the name of "a falling star." "What is that, father?' said she, "I have many times forgotten to ask you why we see the stars fall so often?" "Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, Eleanor,' said the Colonel, which appears to you a star, is not one; it is a spark of elementary, or rather electrical f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, which shines in the ethereal region, and evaporates by the shock of a current of air."</P>
<P>"I do not," said Eleanor, "understand what you mean by electricity."</P>
<P>"Be attentive then, said the Colonel. "ELEC∣TRICITY is a matter of fire invisible to our eyes, but which nevertheless exists; penetrates all bodies; gives to one vegetation, to another trepidation, to another impulsion, &amp;c."</P>
<P>"Explain this more clearly, dear father," said Eleanor.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="035098_0048_1000B5E285D9D938"/>
"ELECTRICITY," continued the Colonel, "cau∣ses the vegetables to grow, agitates the air we breathe, drives the winds with more or less violence, penetrates our bodies, and gives them strength, nay, health; fortifies, and even preserves in us the vital principle; it ren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers our blood active and warm, quickens, and is, perhaps, the cause of its circula∣tion."</P>
<P>"I understand this very well," said Eleanor.</P>
<P>"Well then," said the Colonel, "this electrical matter, the element of every thing that exists, oppo∣sed by a current of air, kindles itself, and produces the appearance you have observed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>This opinion is supported by the Abbe Bertholon, in his work entitled</HI> Physic des Methores.</NOTE>: from this cause also proceeds those spontaneous fires which we often see on the banks of morasses or lakes.</P>
<P>"I comprehend this very well," said Eleanor: "so then all those stars that we see in the heavens are sparks of electrical fire?"</P>
<P>No, Eleanor," replied the Colonel, "those stars are bodies of surprising magnitude; they are globes like the earth we inhabit, but much larger; it is
<PB N="51" REF="035098_0049_1000A360E638F150"/>
their distance only that makes them appear less. Among an infinity of thers, there are six called pla∣nets, which revolve, without ceasing, round that wonderful body of light, the Sun, which is compu∣ted to be upwards of a million of times as large as the earth. The distance of these globes from the Sun, which dispenses light and he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to them all, is so immense, that numbers can scarcely convey an idea of it, and their velocity is no less amazing. MERCURY, which is the planet nearest to the Sun, is about thirty-seven million of miles distant from it, and moves at the rate of a hundred and five thousand miles every hour, completing his course round the sun in less than three months. VENUS, which is the next planet above Mercury, is sixty eight milli∣ons o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> miles from the Sun, and by moving seventy-six thousand miles every hour, performs its revolu∣tion in twenty-three days and twenty two hours. The next planet above Venus is the EARTH upon which we live: its distance from the Sun is ninety-five millions of miles, and by travelling at the rate of fifty-eight thousand miles every hour—"</P>
<P>"How!' interrupted the children, does the earth move?"</P>
<P>"Yes," said the Colonel, it turns once in twen∣ty
<PB N="52" REF="035098_0050_1000B5E555673B98"/>
four hours quite round; and by this motion oc∣casions the apparent motion of the Sun and all the heavenly bodies, from east to west, in the same time: its revolution round the Sun is completed in three hundred and sixty-five days and something less than six hours, or the space of a year, which causes the variation of the seasons: but I shall ex∣plain this more fully hereafter.</P>
<P>"Above the Earth's orb is MARS, whose dis∣tance from the Sun is a hundred and forty-four milli∣ons of miles; it travels at the rate of fifty five thou∣sand miles an hour, and goes round the Sun in something less than two of our years.</P>
<P>"JUPITER, the largest of the planets, is still further removed from the Sun; it is twenty times the size of our Earth, and travels at the rate of twenty-nine thousand miles an hour, completing its journey in something less than twelve years. Still higher in the system, about nine millions of miles from the Sun, is SATURN, who, by travelling at the rate of twenty two thousand miles an hour, finishes his course in about twenty-nine of our years and a half.</P>
<P>Besides these which are called PRIMARY PLA∣NETS,
<PB N="53" REF="035098_0051_1000A36268553DB8"/>
there are in our system others, called second∣ary planets, or satellites, which move round the planets in the same manner as their primaries do round the sun. The first of these is the Moon, which accompanies the earth in its annual progress round the sun, completing its circuit round the earth in the space of twenty nine days and twelve hours. As the moon receives its light from the sun, and presents only one side to us, in the course of its monthly journey, we see more or less of its enlightned side, according to its different position with respect to that part of the earth we inhabit, and hence arises the different appearances which we ex∣press under the name of a new and full moon, &amp;c. Four of these satellites or moons attend JUPITER, and five<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Modern astronomers have discovered two more of these moons which attend Saturn.</HI></NOTE> SATURN; besides these five moons, a broad flat luminous circle called his ring, encircles without touching the body of SATURN at a distance nearly equal to the breath of the ring, which is a∣bout twenty one thousand miles. Some astronomers have thought, that this ring is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omposed of a vast number of moons or satellites, which, being seen
<PB N="51" REF="035098_0052_1000B5E6E5303BB0"/>
at such an immense distance, may, by means of their blended light, give the whole the appearance of one continued body; upon this an eminent astro∣nomer, whose works I lament not being able to put into your hands, says, "when we consider the re∣mote situation of Saturn, and consequently how much the sun's light must be weakned before it can reach him, such a glorious assemblage of moons does not appear an unnecessary appendage to this planet."</P>
<P>In this manner the Colonel began his astronomi∣cal lectures. The two children looked up astonished at the prodigious magnitude of those globes he had been describing, and were desirous of travelling in∣to the planets, especially into Saturn, whose ring and five moons astonished them; but when in due time their worthy instructor spoke to them of the fix∣ed stars, each of which he told them was a sun sup∣posed to enlighten other systems of worlds, they were lost in the stupendous contemplation, and could on∣ly in silence adore the great Being who formed and animated the whole. The Colonel was delighted to see their young minds gradually expand, and was studious to render even the most trifling incidents subservient to their improvement. One day as Elea∣nor
<PB N="55" REF="035098_0053_1000A3680BD2F658"/>

entered the cabin, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he excl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imed in an extacy, "Oh father! if you had but seen what I have!"</P>
<P>"What was it, Eleanor?" said her friend, smil∣ing. "As I was gathering vegetables,' she replied, "upon the great rock, I saw two of those little crea∣tures you, I believe, call lizards, crawl to a hole in the rock, each bearing a small stalk full of seeds.—They laid down their provision at the entrance, and went in, but directly came out accompanied by an old lizard, much larger than they were; he began to eat the seeds, and the two little ones looked at him without stirring; but the noise I made frightening them all three, the old one, in attempting to get away, fell down. I took it up, and was surprised to see that it was blind. While I was examining it, I observed that the two little ones were searching for it with the greatest une<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>siness, so I put it on the edge of the hole, and directly they all three went in, as if they were rejoiced to have escaped so great a dan∣ger. The little lizards must certainly have been the children of the great one."</P>
<P>"Perhaps they were," said the Colonel.</P>
<P>"I was quite delighted,' said Eleanor, "to see them carry food to their poor blind Father, who could no longer seek it for himself."</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="035098_0054_1000B5E9167F8198"/>
"You see, Eleanor," said the Colonel, "that the pure sentiment of filial tenderness is given alike to a∣nimals and to men."</P>
<P>"Animals have then a soul?" said Eleanor.</P>
<P>"Why do you presume that they have?" returned the Colonel.</P>
<P>"They have, at least, <HI>reflectio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI>" said Eleanor.</P>
<P>"Upon what do you found your conclusion?" said the Colonel.</P>
<P>"Why," said Eleanor, "is it not evident that the lizards must have reflection? They, without doubt, say to themselves, our father is blind and old, he can∣not seek food for himself; it is, therefore, our part to carry it to him, that he may live the longer."</P>
<P>"I am pleased with your argument, Eleanor," said the Colonel, as it springs from the goodness and simplicity of your heart; but I will teach you to ac∣count more rationally for what you have seen; many celebrated naturalists have given examples equally striking of the seeming rationality of animals. The intellectual faculties may be divided into two kinds, <HI>soul</HI> and <HI>instinct.</HI> The soul is that portion of us,
<PB N="57" REF="035098_0055_1000B5EA9DE2E4E8"/>
which reflects, foresees, examines and compares. Instinct is that natural sentiment which leads us to preserve our being, to tremble at the sight of a wound, and to compassionate an unfortunate being. Some philosophers have given to this last faculty the name of SYMPATHY. Whatever it be, it is that alone which animates animals, and dissolves with their machines. INSTINCT serves them instead of reflec∣tion. The lizards do not, as you imagine, say, "Let us comfort ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> father." They do not know him under that character: they are ignorant that they owe their life to him, but they love and comfort him because nature prompts them to it. Do you think, my child, that ferocious animals reflect when they fall upon you? No; neither, by the same rule, would those that are gentle, should you treat them ill, resolve to retaliate. They have passions, but they owe them only to the organization of their ma∣chine, and to the nature of their instinct. Had they REFLECTION, they would feel grief, inquietude, and melancholy, sensations which they experience only when sick or wounded. Su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rance is the only sentiment they prove, and this alone can e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ect their spirits or their faculties. So you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leanor, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at animals have no soul; but they have an instinct so
<PB N="58" REF="035098_0056_1000B5ECC68B1068"/>
acute, so subtile, that it is easy mistaken. There are, my children, three sorts of existence. The first passive and insensible; the second active and sensible; and the third, active, sensible, and ratio∣nal. A celebrated naturalist said formerly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Linnaeus.</HI></NOTE>, "That stones grew, vegetables grew and lived, and that animals <HI>grew, lived▪</HI> and <HI>fel▪.</HI>"</P>
<P>"How!" exclaimed Eleanor, "have trees life?"</P>
<P>"Undoubtedly," replied the Colonel, "the sap is their blood, and the elementary or electrical fire, the principle of their life."</P>
<P>"They must then, said Eleanor, "feel pain when we cut them."</P>
<P>"No," said the Colonel, "their life is only pas∣sive; they have neither passions nor affections; but in other respects, they are subject to the same vicis∣situdes that animals are; they <HI>exist,</HI> they <HI>grow,</HI> they <HI>decrease,</HI> and are subject to sicknesses, as we are."</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="035098_0057_1000A3932B086B20"/>
"It is very singular," said Eleanor.</P>
<P>"The more you study nature, my child," said the Colonel, "the more will it ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lt your ideas of that great Being, who with a single word created so many wonders."</P>
<P>"We will never," said the children, cease to adore him, we will love, obey, and pray to him that our soul, which you have taught us is immor∣tal, may live with him for ever, when our bodies are like poor Derley<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s."</P>
<P>This conversation led to digressions on morality and metaphysics, which furnished discourse for more than eight days.</P>
<P>During four years which the colonel had now re∣sided in the island, he had had time to make observa∣tions on its soil and temperature. By the help of his compass, and knowledge of physics, he discovered that it was situate near the 22d degree, 30 min. north latitude, and about 301 degrees W. longi∣tude. The air was extremely, mild, ice and snow being equally unknown. During summer, which began about November, and continued till April, neither clouds, vapours, nor exhalations were to be

seen. The atmosphere was so clear, that not only the rising and setting of the sun, but the increase and wane of the moon might be seen even in full days. At this season the drought was so gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t that the leaves fell from the trees, every plant drooped, and even the animals withdrew into the woods or the hollows of rocks to seek the coolness necessary to their preservation; but when the sun approached the tropic of Cancer, the vapours it exhaled from the sea and marshes, condensed into thick clouds, from whence issued lightning and thunders, accom∣panied with tone <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of rain, which continued during eight or ten days: these rains which cooled the air, induced the Colonel to distinguish this season by the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion of Winter: though very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erent from the Winters of Europe it produced in N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ture the most favorable change.

There was in the island a sort of tree from which flowed a whitish gum so ductile that it might be drawn out into threads: of this Eleanor made nets, with which they caught the most delicious fish, such as thornback, mullet, doree, &amp;c. Tortoise<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of all kinds were so abundant during Winter, that they furnished our islanders with food for the Sum∣mer, a season when these amphibious animals do not appear, on account of the aridity that reigns. In the course of May, large yellow and red ser∣pents, eight or ten feet long, were found in the morasses: the heads of these creatures were in the form of a triangle, and their jaws furnished with long sharp teeth; but they were not dangerous. About this time also, large grey snakes, tufted, and spotted with black, descended with a great noise from the mountains: their heads were about the size of one's hand, flat, and armed with eight teeth about an inch long. These reptiles were perfectly ino<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ensive, and having no sort of venom, made war only upon the ants, which surprising their enemies when asleep, came in battalions to prey upon their eyes.</P>
<P>The Colonel, who was formed equally for the
<PB N="62" REF="035098_0060_1000B5F1511C8228"/>
pleasures of a contemplative as he was for the active scenes of a military life, spent the Winter in study∣ing nature, and the Summer, when the heat was intense, in philosophical reflections; but these could not banish from his remembrance a wife and child, who possessed his fondest a sections, and to whom he had now lost all hope of returning: their image was present in every pursuit; and in spite of his fortitude, he was at times melancholy and dejected. On these occasions Eleanor and Ambrose endea∣voured, by their innocent caresses, and a thousand little tender cares, to dissipate his sorrows and restore him to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: their a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ection called forth on his part an equal return: with delight he saw their young minds <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> instruction, and their suscep∣tible hearts expand with every virtue: then calling to mind the hopeless state in which he had first dis∣covered them, and beholding himself in the hand of Providence, an instrument of their happiness, he lost, in the pleasing contemplation, the remembrance of his sorrows: nay, hope itself once more revi∣ved, and st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttered him with one day restoring them to society, and being himself reunited to all he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dear.

games, returned to him, pale, trembling, and scarcely able to speak.</P>
<P>"What is the matter, Ambrose?" said he: "Speak, Eleanor; what has happened?"</P>
<P>"They are come!" faultered the children; "they are in the island!"</P>
<P>"Whom do you mean?" said the Colonel.</P>
<P>"The great naked men," they replied.</P>
<P>"Well," said their friend, "do not alarm your∣selves; we must retreat to some place of safety."</P>
<P>"They will not come on this side," said the children.</P>
<P>"No matter," said the Colonel, it is necessary that we conceal ourselves:" saying this, he began to strip the cabin, and, assisted by Ambrose and Eleanor, carried the most precious moveables to a subterraneous cave, the entrance of which was ac∣cessible only to those acquainted with its windings. Here they remained some time, when the Colonel, not hearing any thing, and wishing to see the ex∣tremity of the danger which threatened them, as also whether the savages bent their steps toward his
<PB N="64" REF="035098_0062_1000B5F550F25160"/>
beloved cabin, went out, accompanied by his little friends, who refused to be le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t behind, and lying flat on his stomach, on the summit of a mount that over∣looked the isle, beheld the savages, to the number of about forty or fifty, quit their canoes, and ad∣vance into the island. Their skins were painted of such a deep red, that being almost naked, in the sun they more nearly resembled boiled lobsters than men; and to add to their grotesque appearance, round their bodies, on all sides, hung plates of me∣tal, the form of which the Colonel, however, could not perfectly determine. The women, distinguish∣able by their children, which they carried on their backs, wore a pagne or camisa round their waist, closer than that of the men, and about two or three inches deep. Having taken from their canoes ham∣mocks, arms, and different utensils, they penetra∣ted further into the isle, entered the forest, and be∣gan to hunt. This exercise continued the whole day and part of the night, during which the Co∣lonel and his pupils, not daring to descend from the mount, were witnesses of all that passed. They saw them toward morning issue from the wood, carrying with them the beasts they had slain, goats, otters, antas, and a great number of parrots and other birds.
<PB N="65" REF="035098_0063_1000A374AF93CB58"/>
Immediately the quadrupeds were skinned, the flesh out up, and the bones separated. A fire was then kindled, in the manner of the negroes, by rubbing two pieces of wood violently together, and they set about dressing their meats. A large vessel, contain∣ing a quantity of crabs, was then brought, and smal∣ler ones of palm wine, brandy, camphire, &amp;c. after which they began their repast. It was a sight truly comic, to see all these coloured savages squatted, like so many monkies, in a circle, devouring with an excessive appetite, and picking with as much agi∣lity as eagerness, even the smallest claws of the crabs, which are considered among them as a great dainty. Having drank repeated draughts of palm wine and brandy, they began to shout, sing, and burst into fits of excessive laughter, opening an enor∣mous mouth, and discovering the whitest and most beautiful teeth in the world: but soon growing in∣toxicated, they rose, leaped, gambolled, and com∣mitted a thousand extravagancies; till this noisy feast being ended, they on a sudden overturned their uten∣sils, carried them away, and ran half mad to their canoes, which, swift as an arrow, conveyed them from the island. When they were at some distance, the Colonel and his two pupils descended from the
<PB N="66" REF="035098_0064_1000B5F78FAC3CD0"/>
mountain, and replaced in their cabin the movea∣bles they had for safety deposited in the subterranean cave, exhausted with fatigue and hunger, they did not that night go to reconnoitre the place where the savages had been feasting, but the next morning early they set out, and arrived at the field of action. They found there baskets, knives, and wooden cups, which the savages, in their haste and intoxication, had left behind them, besides plenty of good cheer. They took from among the utensils such as appear∣ed to them the most useful and curious, and having rested and refreshed themselves, again set out for their cabin. Their way was through a wood, which they had hitherto but little frequented, and they slop∣ped to admire a grot upon which Nature seemed to have lavished all her beauties. Concealed by cotton shrubs, and bananas, the shade of which gave a religious aspect to the place, they gained the en∣trance by a path hollowed out of the rock, and bor∣dered by a thousand aromatic plants. The entrance, arched and ruinated, was enlightened only by a re∣flection which the light threw on a rivulet that issued from the grot: the banks of this stream being more∣elevated, formed a natural foot way through the grot, at the bottom of which our travellers obser∣ved a faint light, which appeared to shine through the chinks of the rock. This induced them to enter,
<PB N="67" REF="035098_0065_1000A377D5C787F0"/>
but scarcely had they advanced many paces, when deep groans seemed to proceed from the further part of the grot. The Colonel stopped:—and the chil∣dren alarmed, in vain endeavoured to articulate founds which fear froze upon their lips. They ad∣vanced a few paces farther; the groans became more distinct, and in a few minutes they heard these words repeated in a melancholy voice:—"Oh, Death, when wilt thou come to my succour."—"Heavens!" cried the Colonel, "what prodigy is this? The accents are English!"</P>
<P>"Whosoever thou art?" returned the voice, "in pity—"</P>
<P>"Where are you?" interrupted the Colonel, still advancing; "who are you?"</P>
<P>"An unfortunate dying man," returned the voice.</P>
<P>The Colonel still proceeded: the voice seemed familiar to his ear, but he could see nothing. At length, his eyes becoming more accustomed to the gloom, he discerned on the ground a body almost naked, which, on a closer view, he found to be wounded. Shocked at a sight of so much horror,

he knelt down, and taking the hand of the stranger, "Unhappy man," said he, "what barbarian has treated you thus inhumanly?"—He was continuing, when the stranger grasping his hand to raise himself a little, on a sudden exclaimed, "Merciful Hea∣ven! do I deceive myself—that voice—my honoured master—Colonel Carlton—"</P>
<P>"What do I hear?" cried the Colonel. "Peter! Is it possible, Can it be?"</P>
<P>"Thank Heaven!" said the dying man, "I die content: my dear master lives!—"</P>
<P>"Talk not of dying, my faithful Peter," said the Colonel, raising him, and endeavouring to stanch the blood with his handkerchief, "Provi∣dence has not restored you to take you from me so soon. Eleanor, Ambrose, run to the cabin, re∣freshment is necessary."—The children disappear∣ed in an instant, and presently returned with some goats milk, tortoise eggs, and palm wine. The stranger took a little of this nourishment, and was much revived; but the Colonel found that he was not in a state to be removed: he conveyed therefore to the grot, hammocks, mats, and such things as were necessary to render it commodious, and attend∣ed

him there, till finding, in the course of a few days, that his patient had gained a little strength, he determined to remove him to the cabin. It was an interesting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight, to see this worthy man bearing his old domestic upon his shoulders, Eleanor and Ambrose holding each of them a leg, to case the sick man, and lighten the burden of their protec∣tor. The cabin was at some distance from the grot, but, atlast, they arrived at it, and Peter being laid in a hammock, enjoyed soon after a comfortable re∣pose The Colonel, during his abode in the island, had had sufficient time for the study of botany, to know thoroughly the properties of the different sim∣ples it produced: this knowledge he applied so suc∣cessfully, that in less than eight days Peter was out of danger, and at the end of a month was perfectly restored to health.</P>
<P>The Reader will conclude that the Colonel, du∣ring this time, had put many questions to him con∣cerning his misfortunes, the particulars of which he now wished to hear in the order as they had occur∣red; Peter, one day, therefore, gave his master the following recital.</P>
<P>"At the instant, Sir," said he, "that the vessel foundered, I followed your example; seized a piece
<PB N="70" REF="035098_0068_1000A3A615552E80"/>
of wood to assist me in swimming, and threw my∣self into the sea. I struggled long against the vio∣lence of the waves, but at length my strength failed me: I swooned, I believe, and let go the friendly oar that supported me, for I remember no more till I found myself stretched in a canoe, and surrounded by five or six naked men of the most frightful co∣lour. My ideas were confused: I knew not what to think: I cast my eyes on the vast plain of waters, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lightened by the moon: then I looked round for you, my dear master, but not seeing you, and re∣collecting the fatal events that had happened, my heart sunk, and persuaded that you were swallowed in the waves, an involuntary cry of horror and grief burst from me; this terrified the savages who sur∣rounded me so much, that they would have thrown me into the sea, had I not, seeing their design, sof∣tened them by my prayers and tears. One of them at length addressed me in a jargon, composed of English, Dutch, and French, of which I compre∣hended, "<HI>From whence come you, White?</HI>"</P>
<P>"A vessel," I replied, "in which I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ailed has been wrecked, and I should without doubt have pe∣rished, had you not preserved me."</P>
<P>"What is your name, White?"</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="035098_0069_1000B5FAA018E370"/>
"Peter—"</P>
<P>"Have you any knives or scissars about you, Peter?"</P>
<P>"I have only a knife."</P>
<P>"Give it me, White."</P>
<P>"There it is," said I, giving it to him.</P>
<P>"Come," returned he, "I will love thee: thou shalt be slave to the Grand Cacique."</P>
<P>"Oh, Heaven!" I exclaimed, "where do you mean to take me?"</P>
<P>"To Friz," answered the negro, and you will be very happy."</P>
<P>"I now felt the full extent of my misfortune: I was condemned, I saw, to serve the negroes, who, from their serocious aspect, I doubted not were can∣nibals; but lamentations were vain! Our canoe ra∣pidly cut the waves, and at break of day we arrived at the port of our destination. My guides shewed me in triumph to an innumerable tribe of inhabitants, who, bursting into sits of laughter, presently surround∣ed me, and encreased my distress by their importu∣nities. One cut my coat, another tore my waist∣coat;
<PB N="72" REF="035098_0070_1000A37E76FCACE8"/>
in short, they divided my clothes among them, and in a few minutes I was naked as my hand. In this situation I was conducted to the Grand Cacique, who is Governor of the Island. He was seated with great state upon a hammock, in a cabin raised above the rest, and having, as I found, heard my story, received me with much kindness. "White," said he, "thou shalt be my slave; serve me faithfully, and the soul that is in thy heart<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The Carribes imag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne that every human being has as many souls as he has pulses in his arteries, and that the principal of these resides in the heart.</HI></NOTE> will enjoy in Heaven all the happiness that awaits those who have done well: I forbid thee to do three things, White: to drink my brandy, to rob me, and especially to see my wives. If thou dost any of these, I shall kill thee, and thy great soul will float upon the ocean, and mix with the spirits who di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>use evil upon the earth."</P>
<P>"The Cacique ceased; and I, surprized at this singular harrangue, could only bow in sign of sub∣mission, shedding abundance of tears. His gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ess then took me by the hand, and ordered one of his attendants to fill me a cup of brandy to dispel my sorrow.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="035098_0071_1000A383EF90CDB8"/>
The next day I began my labour, which was to turn up the savannas, to plant, weed, clear, and cul∣tivate them: these, and a thousand other services which were added, I performed without intermission during four years that I remained with these barbari∣ans, known in Europe by the name of Carribes, or Cannibals."</P>
<P>"How?" interrupted the Colonel, "are these the Carribes, inhabitants of the Antilles?"</P>
<P>"The same, Sir," said Peter, "I was myself ig∣norant of their name during a year, but I learnt it af∣ter from a French slave who lost his life in their ser∣vice. The isle we now inhabit, Sir, is no other than one of the Antilles, which apparently has not yet been discovered."</P>
<P>"Ah, my good Peter," said the Colonel, what do you tell me? Am I so near Cuba, St. Jago, St. Do∣mingo, Porto Rico?"</P>
<P>"You undoubtedly are, Sir," said Peter, "but you must observe that the islands of which you speak form the Great Antilles, whereas this we now inha∣bit is in the Little Antilles. There are also other countries of the Carribes; but that I have left is so savage and barbarious, and so little commercial, that
<PB N="74" REF="035098_0072_1000B5FD8FBDB960"/>
it is to be presumed it has little connexion with the Europeans established in the Great Antilles."</P>
<P>"Your observation is just, Peter," said the Colo∣nel; but gracious Heaven! a possibility remains—Hope once more revives—I shall again see En∣gland! Yes, my children, I shall conduct you to the abodes of men—to the bosom of my country."—Such was the flattering prospect with which the vici∣nity of cities inhabited by civilized men furnished Colonel Carlton; he did not reflect that he was, ne∣vertheless, seperated from them, and that during four years which he had resided in the island, he had never seen a human being except the Carribes land upon it. The transports to which these hopes gave birth being, at length, somewhat calmed, Peter, at the request of his master continued his narrative.</P>
<P>"The Carribes with whom I lived, Sir, have ve∣ry little commerce with the Europeans; they put to sea every year, and came into this island to kill buffa∣loes, otters, birds, &amp;c. after which they go to the coasts inhabited by Europeans, and barter the skins of these animals, baskets, lizards, and different sorts of eggs, for knives, scissars, hatchets, arms, European linnen, and especially brandy. The day fixed upon for their last voyage, my master ordered me to bring
<PB N="75" REF="035098_0073_1000B5FF16A04C20"/>
into the canoe his hammocks, arms, and household utensils: then having, according to the custom of these idolaters, made libations to the good spirits, we embarked to the number of fifty, as many women as men, and at the end of two days arrived at this island. As it was the first time during four years, my master had made me the companion of his voy∣age, I drew from it the happy presage of soon seeing an end to my captivity: for I doubted not meeting, on some of the coasts at which we should touch, Eu∣ropeans whom I should find means to soften in my favour and prevail on to assist me in my escape. Alas! I foresaw not the issue of that unhappy day. At the end of their brutal repast, my master, intoxicated with brandy, ordered me to fill him another glass: I imprudently ventured to represent to him mildly the injury he would do himself; but instead of tak∣ing this as a mark of my good-will, he seized me by the throat; "Ah, dog of a white," said he in a rage, "thou hast without doubt robbed me—Die, and may thy thousand souls go to the seas, to en∣crease the storms, and form the fires of Heaven!" Saying this, he g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve me several stabs with a knife; but none of them were happily directed to the heart. I had sufficient strength to retreat; and notwitstand∣ing

the effusion of blood, gained a cave, in which I sunk down exhausted, and must have perished, had not Heaven in mercy conducted you, my dear mas∣ter, to the spot."</P>
<P>Eleanor and Ambrose who had listened very at∣tentively to Peter's narrative, were highly incensed against the Cacique, and expressed their indignation in very forcible terms; but Peter endeavoured to mo∣derate it, by observing that the Carribes, though ca∣pricious and cruel, were only so when contradicted. "They cannot," said he, "bear to be dictated to; their pride upon this point is inconceivable; but they are humane, and have great compassion for women and children."</P>
<P>This led the Colonel to make some enquiries con∣cerning the laws and manners of the Carribes, and, especially, whether they were as sanguiuary and fond of feeding upon human flesh, as they were represented by Europeans.</P>
<P>"Nothing, Sir," said Peter, "can be more false; they are certainly anthropophagi, or man-eat∣ers, but it is from accident, not national taste; if they devour their enemies, it is in the transport of fury, in the heat of conquest, and even upon the
<PB N="77" REF="035098_0075_1000B6009C73DBF8"/>
field of battle. They do not like to be called savages;—this name, they say, belongs to beasts of prey: they equally detest that of a cannibal, which is with them equivalent to man-eater; but they are very fond of the title of Carribes, because in their primitive language, this word signifies a good warrior, a cou∣rageous man. The Carribes are in general tall and well proportioned; they have agreeable features ex∣cept the forehead, which is flat and much sunk, a de∣fect which gives them a ferocious air, and arises from a custom they have of pressing the heads of their in∣fants with a little board, tied fast behind, and left there till the fore head has taken the form they wish, and is become so flat, that without raising the head they can see almost perpendicularly above them.</P>
<P>"This custom," said the Colonel, "is not peculiar to the Carribes; it is common to the savages in other parts of America, and it is said to render the skull so hard, as frequently to have broken the swords of Eu∣ropeans when they made the conquest of Peru."</P>
<P>"The Carribes, Sir," said Peter, 'dye their skins red, not only for ornament, but to preserve them from being injured by the intense heat of the sun, and also, to defend them from the mus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ettoes and
<PB N="78" REF="035098_0076_1000B6022231DC48"/>
other infects, which have an antipathy to the smell of the oils, and different mixtures they use. The women, who are shorter than the men, and have a more sprightly air, decorate themselves with brace∣lets, earings and necklaces of glass beads and blue stones; from the age of twelve they wear also a sort of cotton buskins, which reach about five or six inches above the ancle bone, and are wrought so closely to the leg that it is impossible to take them off.—The ornaments of the men are feathers and small plates of a metal they call caracoli; these they wear at their ears, nose, and under lip. The houses of the Carribes are called carbets, and like those of the Indians of Guiana, are of a singular form; the lateral parts are of reeds, and the covering of palm leaves: the roof descending to the rafters, gives to the whole the form of a hive. At the dis∣tance of ten paces is another carb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, half as large, separated into two parts by a pallisade of reeds. The large carbet serves to lodge the chief of the family, and the small one, as a kitchen, and for the accommodation of the women and children, who never enter the great carbet but when the master wishes to receive them. The furniture of the wo∣mens carbet is baskets and hammocks; of the mens,
<PB N="79" REF="035098_0077_1000B6057522C880"/>
bows, arrows, zagayes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>A long dart.</HI></NOTE>, tied to the rafters, and hammocks; ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r which is generally a coffer, mus∣ket, sabre, pistol, and cartouch, effects which they exchange with the Europeans for the productions of their country. The women are very dexterous in a sort of wicker work, of which they make their hammocks, and very curious caskets. In these caskets, which are so neatly wrought that no water can enter, they enclose their jewels and attire, and when they go to sea, fasten them to the edge of their canoes, that they may not lose any thing should they turn over, which very frequently happens. The Carribes, who took me out of the sea, had encoun∣tered, as we had, all the violence of the tempest, but without any alarm, tied like their caskets to their canoes, they follow the revolutions of the waves, turn with them, and continue their rout when the danger is past. They have among them a sort of religion; the sun and moon have all their adoration, but they have neither temple nor form of worship. Some of their laws announce very good sense; such, for example, as the not electing a grand Cacique, till he has distinguished himself in war, and is cho∣sen by a plurality of voices; he must also have borne
<PB N="80" REF="035098_0078_1000B6070A387C50"/>
away the prize in swimming, strength, and forti∣tude. Surely, Sir, such a people ought not to be compared to savage beasts."</P>
<P>The Colonel agreed with Peter, that such a com∣parison was by no means just; and then added; "I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> has often surprised me that the children should, upon their arrival in the island, have found otter skins, nay, I myself," said he, "found some very fine ones when I made my researches the day after the Carribes had been feasting."</P>
<P>"Do not the Carribeans," said he, "carry them away, or is it an act of forgetfulness?"</P>
<P>"The latter, Sir, sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Peter, "appears to be the reason. A minutia would div<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t a Caribe from the most important occupation: they frequently take a deal of trouble to accomplish an enterprize, and if they are attracted by another object, abandon the former, at the moment often in which they are on the point of succeeding."</P>
<P>Peter had nearly completed three score years, but he was still active and vigorous; his health being perfectly re-established, he assisted at the tillage, grinding of corn, and at the most laborious occupa∣tions. He was extremely attached to the Colonel,
<PB N="81" REF="035098_0079_1000B608A0A61BC8"/>
in whose and his father's service, he had passed his youth; he was therefore treated by him rather as a faithful friend, than a domestic, especially now that one common misfortune united them. Peter soon became attached to Eleanor and Ambrose: he would sometimes take them upon his knee, and give them lessons of morality which experience alone had taught him; and sometimes he would play with them like a little child; sing them Carribe songs, and gambol in the manner of the savages. In the mean while, under their indefatigable preceptor, they made a considerable progress in <HI>history, geo∣graphy,</HI> the <HI>mathematics, poetry,</HI> and even music. The description which Peter had given them of a musical instrument called the <HI>bala<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o,</HI> used by the Carribes, had excited their industry; they had in∣vented and executed under the direction of their friend, one less complexed and barbarous: upon this they accompanied songs, of which they com∣posed both the words and music themselves. The subjects were either their gratitude to the Supreme Being, their affection to each other, or the beauties of their island, and the happiness they enjoyed in it with their dear Carlton and honest Peter.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="035098_0080_1000B60A31A073D8"/>
Three years had revolved since the arrival of Peter, and seven since his shipwreck, when the Co∣lonel was one night alarmed by confused cries or rather shouts near his cabin. He started from his hammock, opened the door softly, and went out, but the night being extremely dark, he could not see any thing. The shouts still continued, but seemed at a much greater distance: he knew not what to think; but unwilling, till urged by necessity, to alarm Peter or the children, who were all three bu∣ried in sleep, he ascended a hill that bounded his en∣closure to the north, and looking down, perceived an enormous cloud of smoke through which flames of every colour soon found a passage. The forest that bounds his enclosure is on fire! "Oh heavens!' exclaimed he, seeing the sparks carried towards his cabin, "my children—Peter'—and suddenly dart∣ing from the hill he awakened Peter, took Eleanor in one hand, Ambrose in the other, and flew with them to the sea-shore, while Peter, informed of all by the flames and smoke he saw in the air, carried a few of the most valuable effects of the cabin. He would have returned for what remained, but the wind blowing from the north, carried so many lighted brands upon the little dwelling, that wholly
<PB N="83" REF="035098_0081_1000A391A768CE60"/>
dried by the Sun, it became in a few minutes a prey to the flames. It is impossible to form a just idea of the grief and consternation of the Colonel and his three companions: the children ran—screamed—and seemed ready to throw themselves into the flames to preserve their beloved abode, while the Colonel and Peter beheld the fatal catastrophe buri∣ed in a stupid dejection. The Colonel, however, at length recovering his usual firmness, bent his steps, followed by his little friends and Peter, toward the summit of a neighbouring rock, from whence, casting his eyes round, he endeavoured to divine the cause of a conflagration so fatal and unexpected. On one side they beheld only a vast plain of fire, but looking towards the sea, they saw a croud of Carribes carrying off their e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ects, and embarking precipitately in their canoes. The flames threw a reddish reflection upon th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> savages, and rendered them visible at the distance of half a league on the sea, their arms extended, and their eyes fixed upon the burning forest. Little doubt remained but that the disaster originated with them, and Peter, some∣what recovered from his terror, suggested a very probable cause. "It is evident, Sir," said he, "that the Carribes have, as usual, landed to hunt
<PB N="81" REF="035098_0082_1000B60D5C437558"/>
in the forest, and it appears to me very probable tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this accident may have happened through the stratagem they make use of to catch the parrots, which, among other things, they barter with the Europeans.</P>
<P>"Why," said the Colonel, "do they use fire?"</P>
<P>"Yes, Sir," said Peter, "They observe in the evening the trees upon which these birds perch, and when it is dark, tie to some of the lower bran∣ches an earthen pot in which they put lighted wood, and upon it gum and pemento; the thick smoke which arises, renders the parrots so giddy, that they fall down intoxicated, and become an easy prey to their pursuers, who immediately seize them, tie the feet and wings, and recover them by simply throw∣ing water upon their heads."</P>
<P>The mystery was now unravelled; it was no longer difficult to account for an accident which had proved so fatal to our islanders; but alas! the dis∣covery of the cause did not diminish the calamity.</P>
<P>At break of day they descended from the rock, and returned to the spot where once their beloved habitation had stood. Instead of it they beheld a
<PB N="85" REF="035098_0083_1000B60F0DECED18"/>
heap of smoking ashes! no furniture! no books! no shelter! they must forego all.</P>
<P>In the mean while the fire raged with violence in the forest; at the end of twelve days it was not ex∣tinguished, and would undoubtedly have consumed the whole island, had the forest been adjacent to others; but it was absolutely alone, forming a sort of thicket in the midst of an immense plain: be∣sides, the wind blowing from the north, carried the flakes of fire upon the cabin only, and consequently towards the sea.</P>
<P>During these twelve days, the Colonel was re∣volving in his mind different plans, and was undeter∣mined which to pursue. He saw plainly that he must build another habitation if he remained in the island: but he did not stop here: the idea of making his es∣cape from it had long been the favorite subject of his meditations; he had conceived a project which he believed to be practicable though hazardous, and no∣thing had prevented his putting it into execution, but his affection for Eleanor and Ambrose, whose ex∣treme youth had hitherto rendered them less able to encounter the dangers and fatigues that must unavoid∣ably attend the enterprize; but now that he was stripped of all, that he found himself once more on
<PB N="86" REF="035098_0084_1000B610F7073050"/>
the island without habitation, without furniture, without any thing to render his abode in it desirable, he began again to revolve his favourite project. "If it were possible," said he to himself, "to construct a canoe. My tools cannot be consumed, I shall find them among the ashes. If, I say, it were possible in this canoe to gain the islands inhabited by Europe∣ans! The Antilles form a half circle, so that if we missed one we should unavoidably arrive at another; Cuba, St. Domingo, Jamaica, any of those islands would facilitate our return to England. What a de∣lightful reflection! But, may we not," said he, re∣collecting himself, "fall into the hands of the Car∣ribes, by whom we are to all appearance surround∣ed? My own life I have a right to risk, but ought I to expose to slavery, to the dangers of shipwreck, two unfortunate children, for whom Heaven has ren∣dered me responsible? The Colonel rested some time on this idea; but the hope of seeing England, and of restoring to society two beings whose hearts and manners he had formed, in the end prevailed, and he resolved to hazard all rather than give up an enter∣prize that flattered him with such pleasing prospects.</P>
<P>His plan well digested, he communicated it to Peter; but this wary domestic, far from approving,
<PB N="87" REF="035098_0085_1000B61287118A30"/>
remonstrated with his master upon the danger of the enterprize. "Ah, Sir," said he "reflect, consider, I beseech you, what will be the consequence, should we again expose ourselves to the fury of an element that has already proved so fatal to us."</P>
<P>"But, Peter,' said the Colonel, you have seen the construction of a canoe; you have even guided one?"</P>
<P>"I agree, Sir," said Peter, "that I have; I know very well how to work a canoe; I hope I should not sink you: nay, I could perhaps shun the rocks—but still it is necessary to know where to steer to."</P>
<P>"Do not be alarmed about that, Peter," said the Colonel: we can steer towards St. Domingo, or should we miss that, we shall find other of the Antilles inhabited by Europeans."</P>
<P>"But the Carribes, Sir," said Peter, "think, should we fall into their hands!"</P>
<P>"True, Peter," said the Colonel, "but you know the Isle of Friz: we can avoid that."</P>
<P>"But, Sir," said Peter, "we are undoubtedly surrounded by the Carribes."</P>
<P>"Heaven," interrupted the Colonel, "will pro∣tect
<PB N="88" REF="035098_0086_1000B614CBDDEEF0"/>
us; deprived of all that has hitherto rendered our abode in this island tolerable, we have only a melancholy alternative." More he said to this pur∣pose, till Peter, overcome at length by arguments and importunities, consented to embark in an enter∣prize of which he clearly foresaw all the dangers;—more perhaps than really existed, for being himself ignorant of geography or navigation, he beheld the success of the voyage as much more uncertain than the Colonel.</P>
<P>The children leaped for joy; the pleasure of go∣ing on the sea, of seeing strange countries, rendered them blind to the perils they were to encounter; they saw only the end of the voyage, without bestowing a thought on the accidents that might interrupt it.</P>
<P>The enterprize being resolved upon, they began to remove the ashes, and seek for their tools, which they happily found in a state fit to make use of, ex∣cepting that it was necessary to whet them, and to make new handles, which was the business of three days. The next object was to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ix on a tree calculat∣ed for the purpose of constructing a canoe; and af∣ter much deliberation, the cocoa-tree, of all the island produced, was preferred; not only on account
<PB N="89" REF="035098_0087_1000A399AF5F78D0"/>
of its enormous size, but the nature of it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s wood, which is soft, porous, and easy to work. One of those trees was without loss of time rooted up, the trunk out to about the length of fifteen feet, and the bark stripped of. It was then put upon the stocks, and with the help of fire and hatched <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ollowed, a work that was very long and laborious. The bot∣tom remained flat, and the sides four feet high and fif∣teen inches thick, inclined rather inward. The two extremities, lengthened into a point, turned up a little, that the vessel might the more easily tack about. Our workmen then scraped the surface with flints, and thus compleated their canoe, which when fi∣nished was fifteen feet long, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ix wide, and four deep. A mast and rigging was next to be added, but this was not the most difficult part of the work: a strong branch was the mizen m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st; rushes woven into a mat made sails, and the leaves of the palm tree twist∣ed became strong and solid cordage. As our car∣penters had neither iron nor nails, the whole was joined with teno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and mortises, and fixed with wooden pegs. Peter did not forget to remind his master that the negroes fasten to the sides of their ca∣noes strong cables, that may be stretched horizontally in case of need. "To these, Sir," said he, "as I
<PB N="90" REF="035098_0088_1000B61701CCEC18"/>
have before told you, they tie themselves, that when the tempest agitates the canoe, or causes it to turn over, they may follow the revolutions of their barks. The Colonel took the same precaution, and at the end of a month the little bark was finished, and nothing remained but to launch it; a work which was per∣formed with great ease; for the Colonel, having taken care to fix rollers under his stocks, by means of a capstan the whole was gradually moved to the sea, where the rollers were lost and the bark swam.</P>
<P>Destitute of tools necessary for the undertaking, our reader must judge of the activity that was em∣ployed to root up, cut, shape, hollow, and polish a tree of an immense size. The possibility of effect∣ing it might even be doubted, were i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not known that diligence and resolution are great masters which surmount obstacles, smooth difficulties, and render every thing possible to the man who is enterprising and persevering.</P>
<P>Their departure was fixed for the eighth day of the month of May. On the evening that preceeded it, the Colonel made the two children sit down at his side and spoke to them in these terms.</P>
<P>"To-morrow, my dear pupils, we shall leave

our island; to-morrow we shall resign ourselves to a capricious element in pursuit of man: alas! you may, perhaps, one day regret the peaceful country in which you have till now lived so happy. You may one day reproach me with having caused you to forsake it. No matter; I do my duty, if, as I trust, my confidence in this enterprize is a secret counsel of that benign Being who has hitherto watch∣ed over you. <HI>Man,</HI> my children, is not formed to live alone; he must carry his imperfections into so∣ciety, that he may feel them, and learn that humi∣lity which can alone arise from a sense of his weak∣ness. Excluded from the world, we are apt to as∣cribe to ourselves a perfection which does not belong to human nature, and forget that we are called upon by the great author of our Being to combat and to conquer passions, of the influence of which we are alone insensible, because strangers to the objects that would excite them. Can we, for example, assure ourselves that we are exempt from the sordid passion of avarice, when no object is presented to excite our cupidity? Can we ascertain the conquest we have gained over ourselves, our progress in patience and forbearance before we are contradicted? No, my children; it is in society alone that we can form a just estimate of ourselves; self-love may indeed de∣lude

us, but a cool and impartial examination of our actions, and the motives from whence they spring, will secure us from yielding implicitly to its dictates. In society, my children, you will meet with contradictions, anxieties, and a variety of cares from which a life of solitude would exempt you; but be not discouraged; you will experience equivalent pleasures; your hearts will dilate in the thought that you do not exist for yourselves alone; they will expand in love to all around you, and in proportion as your opportunities of communicating happiness encrease, your own sources of enjoyment will multiply; but let me not, while I draw this in∣viting picture, forget to remind you, that the suc∣cess of our purposed voyage is uncertain: we are on the point of committing ourselves to the caprice of the ocean, in a bark, the work of our unskilful hands:—our rout is by no means certain. The Antilles, 'tis true, are numerous; if we miss one, I trust we shall arrive at another; but many of them are inhabited by the Carribes, and I need not re∣peat the consequence, should we fall into their hands. I do not make these observations, my children, to discourage you; no, my own hopes are strong; they are besides founded upon rational and solid grounds; but I would recal to your young minds, too soon
<PB N="93" REF="035098_0091_1000B61CF5DAE550"/>
elated with the prospect of success, the necessary reflection, that our enterprize is in the hands of God, to whose decrees, whether they tend to pros∣per or frustrate it, 'tis our duty to submit with pious and chearful resignation."</P>
<P>Ambrose and Eleanor listened with attention to the discourse of their friend, and in silence lifted up their hearts to the Supreme Being, and implored his protection. They then with renewed vigor set about conveying on board their little bark, the few articles that had been preserved from the conflagra∣tion. Among these were their tools, and a Carribe casket, containing some jewels, and the letter and articles found upon Derley. These last the Colonel had so much at heart, from the hope that they might one day lead to a discovery of Ambrose and Elea∣nor's parents, that he secured them about his own person, in case of shipwreck or other accident. They laid in also a store of rush matting and cordage made of palm leaves, and thus having completed their little cargo, retired to rest in expectation of the next day, which was to be that of their departure. The Colonel could not close his eyes all night; the success of his approaching voyage, which at a dis∣tance hope had represented nearly a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a certain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y,
<PB N="94" REF="035098_0092_1000A39CDCCB0478"/>
now appeared doubtful; he feared, not for himself, but for those who were to accompany him, especi∣ally for the children; "they," said he, "have scarcely entered the morning of life, and I presume to expose them to the caprices of the waves! to the dangers of shipwre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k! Gracious God," said he, looking with fervour toward heaven, "protect them! but if they must perish, suffer me to perish with them; let me share the punishment of a crime of which I alone shall be guilty." These reflecti∣ons were nevertheless counterpoised by others more pleasing: he still flattered himself with arriving at a port of safety, and the thought of returning to En∣gland, once more lulled him in a pleasing delusion. From this he was, at length, roused by the return of light: the Sun gilt the tops of the mountains, and he arose in haste; but the children and Peter had been before hand with him and were amusing themselves with carrying into the vessel different forts of grain, salted fish, and other provisions that were previously prepared, and, undoubtedly, very needful to undertake a voyage, the term of which was uncertain. One thing, however, which had till now escaped their recollection, caused some em∣barrassment: this was means to carry fresh water, which was equally necessary as the other part of their
<PB N="95" REF="035098_0093_1000B61E809E4F58"/>
stores. The difficulty was, however, soon fur∣mounted by Peter, who presently formed with planks, in the bottom of the vessel, a reservoir for the purpose▪ To prevent the filtrations, he stopped the joints with leaves dipped in a sort of resinous gum which had the property of being impenetrable to the water, and when filled, closed it very exactly, to defend it again the motion of the bark, which he feared might drive out the water.</P>
<P>In two hours all was ready, and nothing was thought on but setting sail, when on a sudden, Am∣brose seeming to recollect himself, entreated the Co∣lonel for a few minutes to delay their departure.</P>
<P>"With all my heart, Ambrose," said the Colonel; "but tell me, do you leave your island with regret?"</P>
<P>"No, father," said Ambrose, "we have nothing to regret, since we take you with us; but we have forgotton—Eleanor, you know what I mean—come with me—quick, quick." Saying this, he took her hand; and without further explanation, set off across the plain, and was out of sight in an insta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. If the Reader is desirous of knowing whither Eleanor and her brother were running with so much precipitation, he need only ask his heart, and he will strongly sus∣pect
<PB N="96" REF="035098_0094_1000B620080B6320"/>
it was to the tomb of their good friend Derley. "Oh yes," said Eleanor, as they ran across the plain, "indeed, we forgot; it was very ungrateful in us not to think of taking a last farewel of him." They presently arrived at the grave, upon which, as a small memorial, they had placed large stones something in the form of a tomb. Here, with full hearts, they prostrated themselves, hand in hand, and began several phrases which they could not finish. "Farewel, farewel, Derley," said they. "Poor Derley! we shall never see you more, but we will always think of you. Poor Derley! There he lies, sister."—"Yes, brother, he will be always there—Farewel, Derley, farewel, we will always remember you.—Yes, Eleanor and Ambrose will keep you always in their hearts!"</P>
<P>Having thus given free course to their gratitude, they rose to return to the sea-shore, when on a sud∣den they started back, struck with a noise entirely new to them, they looked at each other; the noise was repeated: "It is only a clap of thunder, brother," said Eleanor. "No," return∣ed he, "it is not thunder." The noise was repeated a third time; their knees bent under them, and Elea∣nor sunk without sense or motion on the turf. While Ambrose was supporting her, and endeavouring to
<PB N="97" REF="035098_0095_1000A3A49185CB48"/>
recall her senses, confused sounds of distant voices, caught his ear, "Ambrose, Eleanor,' was repeated more than once: he knew not what to do; he would have run from the spot, but affection to his sister with-held him. "Rise, rise, my dear Eleanor," said he, "we are called, it is the voice of our father;" but some time elapsed before her senses returned. At length, supporting her as well as he could, he ran precipitately toward the sea-shore; but instead of go∣ing to that side from whence the voice proceeded, by a natural impulse he took a path that led to that part of the shore where they had left the Colonel and Pe∣ter. They arrived at the spot, but they were not there; their vessel was still on the waves, but no o∣ther trace of their friends remained. Ambrose and Eleanor were too much alarmed to form any settled ideas; they ran here and there, repeatedly calling Father! Peter! and invoking Heaven to hear and pity their anxiety. A cluster of rocks at length set some bound to their despair. "Brother," said Elea∣nor, "it strikes me that we shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd them among these rocks." "Heaven grant that we may," said Ambrose. The path they took winding, by degrees brought them to an eminence, from whence their view comprehending a larger extent of the ocean, they discerned a small vessel sailing from the island
<PB N="98" REF="035098_0096_1000B6218E818FE0"/>
with the greatest rapidity. This sight encreased their grief; they doubted not but that their friends were in the vessel, and that the Carribes, or other enemies, had forced them from the island. Immovable with grief, their eyes swimming in tears, they remained upon the rock till the bark had totally disappeared, and then bursting a-new into a flood of sorrows, de∣scended with heavy steps by a winding path, which brought them imperceptibly to a part of the shore at some distance from that where they had ascended: but what a spect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de of horror struck their sight! a disfigured corpse, covered with blood, lay on the sands! the upper jaw and skull had been carried a∣way; but the height and clothes corresponding, they doubted not but their generous protector lay extended before them. Eleanor shrieked, and again fell sense∣less on the ground, and Ambrose reduced almost to the same state, had scarcely strength or courage to search for proofs to destroy or confirm their dread∣ful suspicions. His heart revived, upon observing that the hands of the unfortunate victim were small and soft, whereas those of his friend were hard, and much sun-burnt; the Colonel wore no stockings, the de∣ceased did; and upon close examination, he found that their clothes in many particulars differed. As for honest Peter, he had no fears on his account, as
<PB N="99" REF="035098_0097_1000B624D7AB3828"/>
besides being much smaller, he was habited in skins. Convinced that it was neither the Colonel nor Peter, he flew to Eleanor, who began to revive, and com∣municated the joyful intelligence; but the idea of its being their friend, had so strongly impressed her mind, that it was not till after she had repeatedly questioned her brother, and examined the proofs, that she could be persuaded her suspicions were un∣founded. For further satisfaction, Ambrose searched the pockets of the deceased, and found in them a pocket-book, knife, pipe and other articles, which they well knew their friend did not possess. This re∣moved every doubt: tears of joy mingled with those of woe were shed on both si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es; it was not their friend—the dreadful certainty of his being no more was re∣moved; and hope, if it did not speak peace to their hearts, at least suspended the violence of their grief. They began to discourse with more c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lmness on what had happened, and attem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted to form some conjec∣tures on the cause of their misfortune. At the side of the deceased they found a weapon, which, by the description they had heard, they judged to be a pis∣tol. This they concluded had deprived him of life, but all beyond was a mystery they could not pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣trate. Tired with co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>jecture they were turning from the melancholy spot, when Ambrose observed
<PB N="100" REF="035098_0098_1000A3DA5F91A270"/>
to his sister, that it was necessary, in some way or other, to dispose of the unfortunate man before them. "Whether he were a friend or an enemy, Elea∣nor," said he, "we owe him the duties of humani∣ty: this was a lesson taught us by our dear father, and shall we neglect to practice it?" He then went in pursuit of a wooden spade, and presently return∣ing, dug a hole in the sand, in which, assisted by Eleanor, he with infinite toil and difficulty deposit∣ed the corpse. They then, hand in hand, took their way along the shore: the sight of their little bark, at length, recalled the remembrance of their friend, and renewed the violence of their grief; they stopped to give vent to their tears, and then sitting down on the point of a ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, they for some minutes were lost in melancholy reflections: at length Eleanor broke silence: "I am persuaded," said she, "that the Carribes have forced them from the island." "There is more reason," returned Ambrose, "to think that it was other enemies; the man whom we have just buried is not a Carribe; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is dressed like our father."</P>
<P>"True," said Eleanor, "but a thought has struck me; perhaps, like Peter, he has been made prisoner by the Carribes; it is very possible that he
<PB N="101" REF="035098_0099_1000A3C08DCC49A0"/>
may have lost his life in the defence of our dear father."</P>
<P>Ambrose paused a moment upon this idea. "What you suggest, sister," said he, "is certainly possible; the unfortunate man we have seen may have lost his life in defence of our father, but the vessel we saw was certainly very different from the canoes of the Carribes."</P>
<P>"It certainly," said Eleanor, "appeared very different; but the distance was great, our eyes might deceive us; for my part, I scarcely knew what I felt or what I saw."</P>
<P>"That is true," said Ambrose; "but yet I am sa∣tisfied, from the description I have heard from my father, that what we saw was a European vessel."</P>
<P>"But the Carribes," said Eleanor, "are so ac∣customed to land upon this island—"</P>
<P>"Well," interrupted Ambrose, "Carribes or Europeans, would to Heaven they had taken us with them! For my part, I would rather have en∣dured slavery, nay, death itself, than what I now feel."</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="035098_0100_1000A46A1509B248"/>
"And so would I," faid Eleanor. "Oh, Am∣brose, our dear father! can we ever forget him! Pe∣ter too—'</P>
<P>A burst of sorrow concluded. The day was spent in lamentations and vain conjectures, and at night they returned with slow and heavy sleps to the cave, which, since the conflagration had served them as an abode. Here every object reminded them of their loss, and renewed the violence of their grief; here their dear protector had discoursed with them; here they had partaken with him the last meal; they wept, they recollected a thousand instances of his kindness, which did but aggravate their sorrow. At length, nature exhausted, called for repose; Elea∣nor sunk into an uneasy slumber; Ambrose did the same, but presently started from it, and began again to ponder upon the dreadful events of the preceeding day; his thoughts hurried from one thing to another, till an idea occurred which fixed effectually his atten∣tion, and revived his hopes. He impatiently waited for the return of day, that he might communicate it to his sister, who no sooner awaked than he addres∣sed her in these words: "What can it avail us, sister, to remain in an island where every object re∣minds <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the happiness we have lost? Our ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k
<PB N="103" REF="035098_0101_1000A46B9E5A37C8"/>
is, you know, ready, it is rigged, stored, every thing is complete. What hinders us from putting to sea? If we remain here, we must for ever give up the hope of seeing our dear father again; where∣as, if we venture to sea, it is possible we may ar∣rive at some island, where we may hear tidings of him."</P>
<P>"But," said Eleanor, starting at so daring an en∣terprize, "we do not know how to guide a canoe—and then the Carribes—"</P>
<P>"As to the guiding of a canoe," said Ambrose, "I have heard Peter describe it so often, that I have no fears upon that head; and as to the Carribes, we must avoid them; we, as well as my father, know the islands that are inhabited by the Europe∣ans, and can easily steer toward them."</P>
<P>"Yes," said Eleanor, "we know them very well upon the map, but when one is upon the great ocean'—</P>
<P>"Well sister," said ambrose, "I do not desire to force you, but for my part, as I have told you before, I would rather endure slavery, or even death, than this dreadful uncertainty upon our dear Carlton's fate."</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="035098_0102_1000A3B502C62CB0"/>
"I would risk every thing," said Eleanor, "were there a hope of discovering him; but our success is very uncertain; we may never reach the islands in∣habited by Europeans, and if we do, may not—"</P>
<P>"Well," interrupted Ambrose, provoked at the obstacles his sister raised to a project upon which his imagination, already began to be much heated, "I see that you are averse to what I propose."</P>
<P>"You cannot surely think, brother," said Elea∣nor, "that I am averse to any thing that can afford a reasonable hope of seeing again our dear father. But we in our certain danger in this enterprize, and after all, our success is very uncertain; if we es∣cape the Carribes, and the dangers of the sea, we may not gain the information we wish.."—</P>
<P>"I agree, my dear sister," said Ambrose, "that it is possible our enquiries may not prove successful: but on the other hand, there is rational grounds to suppose that they may. The vessel which conveyed our friends from the island, was undoubtedly Euro∣pean; it is therefore highly probable, that among Europeans we may find them. Cuba, St. Domin∣go, Porto Rico, and the other islands inhabited by Europeans, lie near to, and without doubt, have
<PB N="105" REF="035098_0103_1000B626B02F57A8"/>
a communication with each other; if we reach one, we shall easily extend our enquiries to others, and it will be hard indeed if we do not somewhere gain the intelligence we seek. Courage and perseverence, sister, are necessary to every enterprize; without these, our dear father has often told us, nothing can be effected, and with them, that few things are im∣possible."—</P>
<P>"And do you really think, brother," said Elea∣nor, half persuaded to listen to a project, which though it at first alarmed her, held out the soothing hope of recovering their lost friends, "Do you re∣ally think we may reach the islands you speak of?"</P>
<P>"I am persuaded that we may," said Ambrose, "I do not pretend to suppose that we are not to en∣counter dangers and difficulties; but, my dear sister, had circumstances been reversed, had my fa∣ther's fate been ours, and he left to lament our loss, do you think dangers or difficulties would have re∣tarded his pursuit? No, be assured his affection would have surmounted every obstacle; and shall we, who owe all to his goodness, fear to encounter the perils of the sea, or, perhaps, slavery, (for this is the worst that can happen) when the delightful
<PB N="106" REF="035098_0104_1000A3BBC3E2A4E8"/>
hope, however distant, is afforded of seeing him and sharing, if we cannot alleviate, his misfortune? Recollect, my dear sister, with what tenderness he has watched over our infancy, how studious he has been to cultivate our minds, and train our hearts to virtue! Reflect upon the many—"</P>
<P>"Say no more, brother," interrupted Eleanor, upon whose feelings this last argument operated more powerfully than all the rest, "I am ashamed of my fears, and will from this moment be wholly guided by your advice. God will, I trust, grant us his protection, and guide us to our dear father, our best, our only friend."</P>
<P>Such was the discourse of Eleanor and Ambrose before they left the cave. They then fell upon their knees, implored the protection of the Supreme Be∣ing, and walked toward the sea shore, discoursing upon their project. The Sun was by this time ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en, and the sea calm, and reflecting, in its various undu∣lations, the purple colours of the firmament, seemed to invite their confidence, and engage them to em∣bark, They stopped a few minutes; entered the ves∣sel, and out the cable that fastened it to the shore. In an instant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> shot away like an arrow. Eleanor, seeing the shore fly from her, shrieked, and would
<PB N="107" REF="035098_0105_1000B62888E96710"/>
have returned to the island; but Ambrose, affecting the greatest fortitude, employed all his eloquence to encourage his sister, and at last succeeded. A wind presently arising from land, drove them into the open sea, and their beloved isle soon vanished from their view. The sun, in the mean while, had run more than half his course, and the weather, which had till now been favourable, on a sudden changed: thick clouds obscured the air, the sea ran high, and some drops of rain threatened an approaching storm; all nature seemed to prepare for a great revolution. Am∣brose, though alarmed, endeavoured, by every ar∣gument he could suggest, to encourage and per∣suade his sister there was no danger, but the horror, which, in spite of his efforts to appear serene, was impressed on his countenance, and the gulf, which from time to time opened and threatened to swallow them, spoke too forcibly not to be understood. Elea∣nor, nevertheless, encouraged by the example of her brother, summoned all the resolution she was mis∣tress of, and resolved, if it were the will of God that they should perish, to meet death with fortitude. The weather, however, which continued foul till the middle of the night, at length cleared, and gave place to the Moon, which, reflecting her silver disk
<PB N="108" REF="035098_0106_1000A3BF0A0260C0"/>
upon the waves, somewhat re-anim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted the courage of our poor voyagers, more embarrassed on the li∣quid elements, than were, heretofore, the first navi∣gators. But on a sudden a new object excited their terrors. On the top of their mast shone a light, which to their troubled imagination, seemed fire de∣scending from heaven to consume their vessel. This, tho' an appearance familiar to mariners, &amp; the natural consequence of a heated and damp atmosphere, struck them with inconceivable horror. They clasped each other closely, and fixing their eyes upon the electric flame, had neither power to weep nor to speak. Nor was this all; the sea ran high. Some∣times their little bark rose upon the billows, and then again seemed to sink, never to rise, into the depth of the vast ocean. Death every instant present∣ed itself to their view, and they could only wonder that they had not already met it in the waves.</P>
<P>Thirty hours they remained in this anxiety, scarce∣ly daring to stir, and only from necessity taking a little of the nourishment their vessel afforded, At length, near the close of the day, the wind chang∣ing carried them towards a coast, which, on the first view, appeared to be desert; but on approaching it they distinguished men running on the sands, to ex∣amine
<PB N="109" REF="035098_0107_1000B62A11400018"/>
their bark. Their hearts rebounded at the sight of land; they perceived by the dress and colour of the islanders, that they were not Carribes, and far from being alarmed, were inspired with the great∣est confidence. They rejoiced at the prospect of be∣ing once more safe upon land, and hoped soon to hear news of the colonel and Peter, as if, (such was was their simplicity) all the world was obliged to know them.</P>
<P>When they were near land, a little boat took them on board, and carried them on shore; but the astonishment of the islanders upon finding two child∣ren habited in skins, alone, in a bark ingeniously constructed and furnished with different sorts of pro∣visions, is not easy to be described; a thousand questions were in an instant put to them, to which they answered in English, have you seen Colonel Carlton or Peter? Where are they? In pity tell us, we are seeking them, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The islanders, who were Spaniards, understood nothing of all this; but one among them, who knew English, acted as interpreter, and answered by assur∣ing them that they knew nothing of the persons of whom they spoke.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="035098_0108_1000A3C7654824C8"/>
The noise of their arrival, and the singular cir∣cumstances that attended it, soon reached the ears of the Governor, to whose palace they were conduct∣ed amidst a croud of people, whom curiosity had drawn together.</P>
<P>The Governor viewed them with surprize, put several questions to them, and seemed to be much pleased with their youth and simplicity. Ambrose and Eleanor, giddy with all they saw and heard, answered only in monosyllables, or by something in which the Colonel or Peter always made a part. The Governor, who spoke English, in vain as∣sured them he did not know their friends: solely oc∣cupied with the idea, they would absolutely insist upon his knowing them, and giving them the infor∣mation they wished. At length, after repeated ques∣tions, the Governor made them sit down, and ad∣dressed them to this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. "My children, you ap∣pear to me to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and wise.; I am a sove∣reign of this island which is called St. Verado, one of the Lacaye isles; I made a discovery of it twelve years si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce, and have established in it a colony, of which I am chief. You shall remain at my Court, and shall have no reason to regret the country you have left. As for this Colonel, who seems to inte∣rest
<PB N="111" REF="035098_0109_1000A3CC5E6BD398"/>
you so much, I will cause him to be sought; Do not make yourselves uneasy, you shall have news of him shortly. Poor children! how old are you?</P>
<P>Do you know?</P>
<P>Ambrose replied, "We are almost fifteen."</P>
<P>"And what is your name?" said the Governor."</P>
<P>"I am called Ambrose."</P>
<P>"And you?"</P>
<P>"Eleanor."</P>
<P>"Well, Eleanor, "said the Governor, "come near me: are you afraid? have I an ill look?</P>
<P>"No," said Eleanor. "Well then," continu∣ed he, "draw near: you will be very happy here, and you too, Ambrose."</P>
<P>A superb supper was now served up, during which the governor lavished on his young g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ests the most flattering attentions, especially upon Eleanor, with whose beauty and artless graces he appeared much delighted. Eleanor and Ambrose eat but little; though much comforted by the gover∣nor's promises in behalf of their friend; they
<PB N="112" REF="035098_0110_1000A3CADAC4B4F8"/>
could not forget that they had lost him; besides, their attention was wholly engrossed by the objects that surrounded them: the wax lights, the plates, the meats, the furniture, and then the clothes of the islanders! all struck them with wonder and delight. They could only gaze and admire, they had not leisure to eat▪ and scarely to attend to the questions of the Governor. Supper being at length ended, and a few hours having in some measure fa∣miliarized the surrounding wonders, the Governor requested Ambrose to acquaint him more particu∣larly with his adventures. He complied, and ac∣quitted himself with the best grace imaginable; omitted no circumstance that was in the least inte∣resting; spoke in the highest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erms of their obligations to Colonel Carlton; extolled the fidelity of Peter, and concluded with describing the manner in which they were deprived of their friends, their grief, and the happiness they should experience could they be restored to them.</P>
<P>The Governor thanked Ambrose for his narra∣tive; and observing that rest was necessary after the fatigues they had undergone, ordered each to be con∣ducted to a separate apartment. The thought of a separation, situated as they were among strangers,
<PB N="113" REF="035098_0111_1000B62D4DE83DE0"/>
and in a strange land, excited a painful sensation, but propriety rendered it necessary, and they sub∣mitted. In the morning however, at day break, Ambrose hastened to his sister<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s apartment; she was already up, and when sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> saw her brother, melted in tears?</P>
<P>"What is the matter, my dear sister?" said he; "why are you in tears?"</P>
<P>"I don't know," replied Eleanor; "but every thing here alarms me: I am afraid we shall be very unhappy."</P>
<P>"Why do you think so?" said Ambrose.</P>
<P>"I don't know," returned Eleanor, "but there is something in this Governor that terrifies me very much. He is not like our dear Carlton."</P>
<P>"True, Eleanor," said her brother; "but what do you apprehend?"</P>
<P>"I don't know," said Eleanor; "but whenever he speaks, or looks at me, I cannot help trembling."</P>
<P>"Nay, my dear sister," said Ambrose, "that is absurd; there is at present no cause for alarm; the

Governor treats us with kindness, and gives us hopes of seeing our dear father; what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we desire more? Besides, let the worst happen, if we are not happy here, we can embark again in our vessel."</P>
<P>"I am, indeed, very foolish," said Eleanor, dry∣ing her tears, "but you most allow that there is something very forbidding in the countenance of this Governor."</P>
<P>"I agree with you sister," said Ambrose, "that Don Lescar has neither the co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>enance nor man∣ners of our dear Carlton; but we are not on that account to conclude that he is base or treacherous; how often has our father described to us the diversity which reigns throughout human nature; he has told us that a corrupt heart is frequently hid under a pleasing set of features; and may we not equally in∣fer, that a good o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e may be concealed by an unpro∣missing countenance?</P>
<P>In this manner, though himself not prepossessed in favour of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ost, did Ambrose endeavour to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the fears of his sister. While he was thus en∣gaged, a servant came to conduct them to Don Lescar, who received them with great kindness▪ and excited their confidence by a thousand flatter∣ing

They accordingly let out un∣der the conduct of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and were much amus∣ed with observing the variety which reigned in the persons, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and buildings of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: eve∣ry thing was to them new and interesting. The houses, only one story high, were built with wood and bricks made of a sort of reddish earth found in the mountains? the streets long, spacious, and re∣gularly built, formed a star, the center of which was a spacious square, describing an exact pentagon. No shops were to be seen in the island; the inhabitants, to the number of about four hundred, as many men as women, lived upon the produce of a little field, which each cultivated behind his house. At the side of Don Lescar's palace was a chapel, in which was an old Dominican, who was held in great venerati∣on by the whole island, presided. With respect to the morals and customs of this Baytian colony, the reader will soon learn them from the mouth of an

inhabitant, who will play an interesting part in the sequel of this history.</P>
<P>The island was situated about the 25th degree 15 minutes north latitude, and 57 degrees 11 minutes west longitude. It might be in length about six lea∣gues, and in breadth three: nothing was wanting to neatness, convenience, or utility: the houses were built along the sea-coast to the east, where a port was formed, well fortified with a tower and ramparts. Here Eleanor and Ambrose stopped, while the of∣ficer, their guide, withdrew to converse at some dis∣tance with a friend whom he had met. They sat down, and fixing their eyes upon their little bark, which remained chained in the basin, began to call to their remembrance the happy hours they had spent with their protector, when a little old man with a long white beard, came and seated himself beside them: he looked steadfastly on them for some mi∣nutes, and then broke silence:—"Amiable, inte∣resting children," said he, "suffer an old man, whose head is white with age, to behold and converse with you: from the first moment! saw on the port, your youth, your innocence, your misfortunes in∣terested me: As I view you, my heart expands: speak, amiable children, who gave you birth?"</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="035098_0115_1000B63059E02158"/>
"We are ignorant," replied Ambrose; "in our infancy we were deserted in an uninhabited island: God sent us a father a protector; he brought us up and instructed us; but we have just lost him, and set out determined to seek him all over the world, when chance brought us to your country."</P>
<P>"How I pity you, my good children!" said the old man, "how! lament that you must reside a∣mong men so wicked as those which inhabit this island!"</P>
<P>"What do you tell us!" exclaimed Eleanor and Ambrose, alarmed.</P>
<P>"I tell you, my children," replied the old man, "a melancholy truth; nothing but unbridled licen∣tiousness reigns here; vice and folly divide the wretched inhabitants of St. Verrado."</P>
<P>"But Don Lescar—" inter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>upted the children: "the has loaded us with kindness—he has promised us his protection."</P>
<P>"Ah! my children," <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail the stranger, "his promises are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but to deceive and entangle you in his snares; fated experience has rendered me wise;
<PB N="118" REF="035098_0116_1000B632D260BE10"/>
suffer me then to warn you of your danger; it was for this I watched a favourable moment to accost you."</P>
<P>Ambrose and Eleanor thanked the old man for the friendly interest he took in what concerned them, and assured him of their readiness to attend to his coun∣sels; at the same time they could not forbear express∣ing their surprize that he should continue to reside among such wicked people. "Alas! my children," said the stranger, necessity not inclination detains me: would to Heaven I could abandon this detested place! but fate has rendered it my prison."—Here the old man seemed for some moments overwhelmed with grief; then recollecting himself, and observing, by the intelligent countenances of his young auditors, the impression his discourse made upon them, he re∣sumed: "I see, my young friends, that my dis∣course surprizes you: you know not what to think of it; but the history of our Governor, with which a residence of some years in this island has fully ac∣quainted me, will throw a full light on my subject. Don Lescar was born of a good family at St. Do∣mingo: being destined from his youth to the ser∣vice of his country, he was sent by the Governor of the island upon an expedition, in which he dis∣graced
<PB N="119" REF="035098_0117_1000A3B151F81900"/>
himself by the most unheard-of excesses; noth∣ing withstood his rapacity; unawed by any princi∣ple of justice or honour, by nature avaricious and cruel, he preyed upon the substance of the people he was sent to de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end: his depredations were at length made known to the Governor; he was tried, and condemned to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y the forfeit of his life; but before the sentence was executed, George Blake, the cap∣tain of an English vessel, one of his most zealous partizans, and some others, partly by force and partly by bribery, found means to set him at liberty. They failed for South Carolina; but near the lake of Bahama were encountered by a violent tempest, which continued eight hours. They then hoisted fail, but the winds proving contrary, and their yard and top mast being broken, they were o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>liged to abandon themselves to chance, and at l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st found themselves near an island, which the pilot assured them was one of the Lucay or Bahama Isles, which was probably yet unknown to Europe: for though Christopher Columbus discovered forty, it is well known that more exist. While the carpenter pursu∣ed his work, Don Lescar, with his friend Blake, and a few others advanced into the isle, which he found to be fruitful, but entirely unfrequented, and wild; immediately the singular idea of founding a
<PB N="120" REF="035098_0118_1000A4010907A928"/>
colony struck him; he communicated it to his friends and to the whole crew, who having left their coun∣try to escape the punishment of their crimes, or upon different discontents, unanimously approved it: in short, they took possession of the island, tilled the land, and built commodious habitations: but they had among them no women, and they wanted wives. In this dilemma, Don Lescar, ever fruitful in ex∣pedients, recollected the stratagem made use of by the Romans to carry of the Sabine women—but I forget, my children, that you are unacquainted with the history of civilized nations—"</P>
<P>Eleanor and Ambrose here interrupted him to ob∣serve, that though they had been brought up on a desert island, their kind friend had taught them that they were not the only beings existing in the world, and had acquainted them with the history of other countries.</P>
<P>The old man then continued: "Don Lescar pro∣posed to his comrades to make use of the same stra∣tagem, and they accordingly set <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail for Cuba, an island inhabited by the Spaniards. There feigning themselves travellers come to see the country, they one night gave <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> on board their vessel to the women, who assembled to the number of sixty,
<PB N="121" REF="035098_0119_1000A3E21E739BC8"/>
with some gentlemen: I was unfortunately among the latter, for in the midst of our gaiety, our perfi∣dious hosts weighed anchor. The wind was favou∣rable, and the vessel departed, while the people on share gazed on us with the utmost unconcern, think∣ing Don Lescar's design was merely to afford us the pleasure of a little excursion on the sea; we too at first believed his intention to be no other, but fa∣tally were we undeceived? The vessel, which was a swift sailer, in spite of our prayers and tears, conveyed us to this island, never to return. The men, myself only and a few others, from whom they judged they had nothing to fear, excepted, were all massacred; the women alone, who were the objects of their treachery, were preserved, and those assembled at the fete, being for the most part dissipated and abandoned, easily accommodated themselves to the terms offered by Don Lescar. A few, however, preferred death to becoming the wives of their base enslavers; and these drag out a miserable existence in the prisons of St. Verrado.</P>
<P>When the inhabitants were furnished with the ne∣cessaries, they began to think of the luxuries of life, and George Blake, at the head of an hundred men, put to sea to pillage merchant-men and other vessels▪
<PB N="122" REF="035098_0120_1000B6345746A9F8"/>
when he meets one superior in force to his own, he hoists the white flag, salutes it with three fires, and pusses as a friend; but if it has suffered from the tempest, or is inferior, he attacks it, throws out his grappling irons, and brings it in triumph into our port, taking always the cruel precaution to massacre all the men from whose courage or address <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e thinks he has any thing to fear: he acts the same with res∣pect to vessels which unfortunately put in here for repairs, or to take in water: violating every law of justice and hospitality; he murders the men, and seizes upon the women and cargo. By such means he has collected this little fleet of twenty sail, which you see in the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sin, and has procured for the colony in profusion, all that is necessary to encourage luxury, and secure the establishment of his colleague. It is seven days since he set out upon one of these expeditions; he is not yet returned, and his absence so much longer than usual, begins to alarm the whole colony. It is not improbable but that this villain may have met the just punishment of all his crimes.</P>
<P>With respect to the Verradians, there is scarcely an excess to when they are not carried; drunken∣ness reigns indiscriminately amongst them. As the
<PB N="123" REF="035098_0121_1000B636BB32C900"/>
prizes made by their vessels are divided in the public square among the inhabitants, each has a profusion of brandy, and other spirituous liquors, which they employ to their own destruction: even children are infected with this dreadful vice; there are already in the island upwards of two hundred, who, corrupt∣ed by the example of their parents, before they have attained the age of reason, lose the little they possess in draughts of brandy. The inhabitants are in continual strife, and sometimes kill <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> other, but this crime is punished with death. They know here no other employment than di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>pation, no other God than volu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ousness, and no other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> than liberty. Thus ene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vated by i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leness and excess, they are not in a state to resist the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> attack: a hundred men, could they discover and surprize it, would be sufficient to sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e the whole colony; but Don Lescar has prohibited any one under pain of death, leaving it without hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> order or permission. Nor is this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; the vessels you see here are with their boats chained in the basin; and he alone has the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey of the chains.

<P><PB N="124" REF="035098_0122_1000B6388CBAE558"/>
Ambrose and Eleanor trembled at these dreadful words, which the stranger observing, hastened to divert their attention.</P>
<P>"Don Lescar," said he, "notwithstanding these precautions, is sensible that other chains than those of force are necessary to bind his subjects; he labours to render their state agreeable, that he may add those of inclination; with this view he permits an unre∣strained licence, which he judges alone capable of attaching them. To consess the truth, all are satis∣fied with their condition, and among them there is not a single inhabitant, myself excepted, desirous of quitting St. Verrado to inhabit another country. Every day there are superb entertainments at the palace of the Governor, balls, concerts, and assem∣blies, they love riot and dissipation; what would they more? they have it to their wish. Such, my children, are the laws of the Verradians; such their manner of life; endeavour to bear with, and to ac∣commodate yourselves to it, without wandering from the principles of virtue: live here, since hea∣ven has sent you, wise, gentle, modest, temperate, and do not imitate the odious companions with whom you must associate. I will from time to
<PB N="125" REF="035098_0123_1000A3E6A35C8168"/>
time see, and advise you: persuaded that you will be secret, and set some value on my lessons.</P>
<P>Eleanor and Ambrose astonished and shocked at all they heard, thanked the old man for his informa∣tion, and expressed their readiness to be guided by his advice. Then seeing their guide, he bade them farewell, telling them at parting, that he was called the Count d'Oresty.</P>
<P>Don Lescar upon their return, inquired how they liked his city? But observing the impression of melancholy, which notwithstanding their efforts to appear chearful, the discourse of the Count d'Oresty had left upon their countenances, he expressed his displeasure. Eleanor and Ambrose excused them∣selves, attributing it to the concern they could not help feeling for the loss of their protector. This was the first time they had ever known dissimulation, or felt the necessity of it. "And wherefore," said the Governor, "this unavailing sorrow? This Carlton was your friend and protector: well, I will be so; I will love and protect you as well as he did; I will do more; I will cause all my subjects to honor and respect you. Besides, a thought has struck me concerning your friend; the manner in
<PB N="126" REF="035098_0124_1000B63A811A8C08"/>
which he and Peter disappeared, is singular; I have reflected upon it, and do not think it in the least improbable but that you may, in a very short time, see him land in this island."</P>
<P>Eleanor and Ambrose exclaimed in an extacy, How? Where? My Lord—do you know?—Is there any hope of—</P>
<P>"Have patience," interrupted Don Lescar, "and be not so elate; what I suggest, is merely conjecture; I will tell you upon what grounds: My subjects frequently make short trips upon the seas, for the purpose of taking prizes; it is not eight days since one of my captains sailed with about a hundred and fifty men: now as the time agrees with that in which, by your account, your friends dis∣appeared, it seems very probable that he may have touched at the island, and borne them away to en∣crease the inhabitants of my colony. Can you des∣cribe the corpse you found lying on the ground?"</P>
<P>"No," replied Ambrose, "it was too much disfigured; but we found about it some papers and other articles which I will shew you. Saying this, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e searched his pocket, and produced them; but no sooner had Don Lescar examined the papers,
<PB N="127" REF="035098_0125_1000A3EB1D917158"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>an his countenance changed; "Heavens! exclaim∣ed he, what do I see! 'tis the hand writing of my friend! 'tis he himself; the hand of an assassin has divided us for ever." With these words he darted a furious glance upon Ambrose, grasped the papers, and went out of the apartment, without pronounc∣ing a single word. The children looked at each other amazed: "What have we done?" said Eleanor.</P>
<P>"He thinks," said Ambrose, "that the man who was killed upon our coast is his friend."</P>
<P>"Let us fly," said Eleanor, alarmed, "perhaps he will revenge his death upon us."</P>
<P>"And why fly?" said Ambrose, "were that even possible, when we may expect soon to see our dear father; he will counsel and defend us.</P>
<P>"Ah, no," said Eleanor, "he is without doubt murdered: we can no longer entertain the hope of seeing him."</P>
<P>A deep silence ensued, and they remained over∣whelmed with the bitterest reflections. Two days elapsed before they saw the Governor; on the third he sent for them into his apartment; his counte∣nance was gloomy and morose; hut he received them
<PB N="128" REF="035098_0126_1000B63D7572DC80"/>
with his former kindness. "I have suffered much, my young friends," said he, "since I saw you; I have shed many tears and it is this Carlton whom you regret so much, who has caused them to flow; banish him, therefore, from your remembrance, as the enemy of one whom you must henceforth learn to honour and obey."</P>
<P>"Ah, my Lord," said Eleanor, falling upon her knees, "pardon our dear protector—the injury he has done you was involuntary: in his own defence—Pardon him; Eleanor on her knees entreats it. As a favour—"</P>
<P>"As a favour, sister," interrupted Ambrose bluntly; "as justice you mean; had Don Lescar been in the place of our Carlton, would he not have done the same?</P>
<P>"Young man," said Don Lescar, incensed at the oblique reproof that was conveyed to him in these words, "moderate your impetuosity; remember that you are in the presence of your King.</P>
<P>"I respect your title," said Ambrose, "though I know not what is due to it; but I appeal to your heart, to your probity: you believe that our Carlton has destroyed your friend, admitting it to be so, you
<PB N="129" REF="035098_0127_1000A3F001E8DC70"/>
know not the provocation:—WE are assured it was in defence of his life or liberty, and, in this case, is he not justified? The man of honour should approve the actions that honour justifies."</P>
<P>"And do you," said Don Lescar, "bred in the depths of forests, pretend to talk of honour? Do you pretend to know its laws?"</P>
<P>"I know the rights of man toward man," said Ambrose, "they are equal to all beings, common to all States."</P>
<P>"And so," said Don Lescar, with a sarcastic smile, "knowing natural laws, you pretend to judge of those prescribed by civil society and religion? Are these the fine maxims your friend has taught you?"</P>
<P>"He has taught me at least," said Ambrose, "to despise irony, and to brave pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>."</P>
<P>Don Lescar was incensed: "Ungrateful wretch," said he, "is this the return for all my favours? Tremble at the effects of my displeasure."</P>
<P>It must be owned that the sentiments of Ambrose were uttered with an asperity and confidence that cannot be justified: Don Lescar was his superior in
<PB N="130" REF="035098_0128_1000B63F01B3CE68"/>
years; had hospitality entertained him and his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, &amp; though the Count d'Oresty had destroyed the confi∣dence they might otherwise have reposed in him, no personal injury had yet been offered; some respect was, therefore, due to him; but bred in unfrequent∣ed wilds, accustomed to combat the beasts of the forest, and hardened by labour and fatigue, Am∣brose had contracted a certain roughness of character, which rendered him a little savage: he had never been contradicted; on this occasion he was; his heart, replete with the noblest sentiments, could not brook the pride of a man, whom he not only consi∣dered as the enemy of his dearest friend, but de∣graded by his vices beneath the lowest of his species. Eleanor possessed equal strength of mind with her bro∣ther, but she was more timid; every thing alarmed her, because she more quickly foresaw the conse∣quences. Terrified at the scene that was taking place between her brother and Don Lescar, she en∣deavoured in vain to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them: "Be calm, my Lord," said she: "Brother, do not vex him."</P>
<P>"It is for your sake alone, Eleanor," said Don Lescar, "that I can forget the insults and arrogance of a youth, who is unworthy a sister so beautiful and interesting: my heart is already weighed down
<PB N="131" REF="035098_0129_1000A3F5A4790170"/>
with care; the hand of an ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssin has bere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t me of a faithful friend and a valuable subject: it is you only who have power to console me: I love you, Elea∣nor, you sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l one day be Queen of St. Verrado—Do you not understand me? You are at present young; I will be your guardian and protector, but at last you shall be my Queen."</P>
<P>It is impossible to express the astonishment of Eleanor; the idea of ever becoming the wise of Don Lescar, however distant the period might be, st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ck her with a horror which she could n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: be observed it, but not thinking it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> fur∣ther upon the subject, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>; but with a lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k which taught his young guests they had every thing to fear if his will was resisted.</P>
<P>"Oh!" said Eleanor, "what will become of us!"</P>
<P>"Fear nothing, sister," said Ambrose, "God will protect us; I trembled on the waves, I wept at our separation from our dear father and Peter, but I will never weep or tremble at the threats of a tyrant: we will endeavour to see our good old man; he will console and advise us." Saying this, they took their way towards the port, in the hope of meeting the Count d'Oresty, but they were that night disappoint∣ed: in short, several days elapsed before they saw
<PB N="132" REF="035098_0130_1000B64088AA6628"/>
him, except in the presence of witnesses, before whom it was impossible to discourse of any thing in∣teresting. During this time, Ambrose and Eleanor had the mortification of hearing the most horrid exe∣crations bestowed upon the name of Carlton; he was now universally believed to be the assassin of the naval Chief, and the arrival of the Verradian ves∣sel was awaited with impatience, to sacrifice both him and his accomplice, Peter, to the vengeance of the people. Eleanor and her brother, therefore, far from looking with joy, as formerly, to the mo∣ment of his arrival, prayed fervently to Heaven that it might be retarded. In the mean while a de∣lay so unusual began to alarm the inhabitants, from the supposition of their vessel being captured, and a discovery made of their retreat. The port was doubly guarded, and the whole colony put into a state of defence; but in a short time their fears in∣sensibly decreased, and lulled in indolent security, they returned to their former course of luxury and dissipation.</P>
<P>Eleanor and Ambrose continued to be treated as the distinguished guests of the Governor; but under this mask of kindness, it was easy to discern that he concealed an implacable hatred to Ambrose,
<PB N="133" REF="035098_0131_1000B6420E118060"/>
he could not, without indignation, behold the pride and firmness of a youth whom he considered as a savage; the strictness of his principles, and the soli∣dity of his arguments, always on the side of virtue, incensed him; the unshaken attachment too which he at all times discovered to his dear friend, and the freedom with which, even at the peril of his life, he expressed his sentiments on this subject, was another cause of his disgust; in short, his hatred arose to such a pitch, that had it not been for Eleanor, it is probable he would have sacrificed him to his resent∣ment. She, however, more soft and gentle, medi∣ated between her brother and Don Lescar, and thus warded off the blow that might otherwise have proved fatal. As observed before, Eleanor was now nearly fifteen; she was tall, and well-made; her sun-burnt complexion was fresh as the dew; her teeth were white and regular, and her large dark eyes sparkled with intelligence and vivacity: her hair flowed negligently in natural curls upon her shoulders, and there was a gentleness in her man∣ners, and a grace in her least motion, that rendered her whole figure inexpressibly interesting. Don Lescar was struck with her innocence and beauty, and from the first moment of her arrival conceived
<PB N="134" REF="035098_0132_1000A3FA28903F30"/>
the idea of making her one day his wise. From this cause had arisen the favours he had bestowed on her and Ambrose; favours which they might justly have claimed from humanity and hospitality; but Don Lescar was a stranger to both, and was too depraved to bestow upon other ground<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> than those of self-convenience or self-gratification.</P>
<P>Ambrose and Eleanor had now more than once seen and communicated their griefs to the Count d'Oresly; the good old man sincerely sympathized in their sorrows, and by his counsels endeavoured to confirm them in the principles of virtue; he often pointed out to them, in the wretched inhabitants of St. Verrado, the fatal effects of luxury and intem∣perance; "behold," said he, "their features dis∣torted, their constitutions undermined, their reason obscured, their faculties decaying even before they have attained their due maturity, and their whole frame convulsed with passions which degrade them far beneath the beasts which they despise; such, my children, is the price of pleasures which cloy in the possession, and which are pursued more, perhaps from habit than from inclination. He then set before them the superior advantages of a life of virtue and moderation, and thus strengthened them against the
<PB N="135" REF="035098_0133_1000B6444AD19F70"/>
temptations to which their innocence was exposed among the dissipated companions with which they were daily constrained to associate. One day, as they were as usual, discoursing upon their misfor∣tunes, and lamenting the cruel necessity which doom∣ed them to live under a tyrant whom they abhorred, having remained a few minutes silent, the Count ad∣dressed them in these words: "When I reflect, my children, upon the dangers to which your inno∣cence is exposed, and that your lives are scarcely safe in a place where you are beheld as the friend of one who is universally believed to be the assassin of a man, who, though stained with the blackest crimes was nevertheless the idol of his comrades, I feel an irresistible desire to deliver you from so many pe∣rils: my own life is of little importance; in a few years I shall be removed to a country far beyond this circumscribed spot of earth. I had resolved to wait for this happy release in St. Verrado, since a whimsical destiny had made it my abode; but your misfortunes, my children, the perils to which your innocence is exposed, has shewed me the possibility of an escape, which would otherwise have remained undiscovered, as unsought."</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="035098_0134_1000A3FDF61E10A0"/>
"But," said Eleanor, "our dear Carlton; we must stay and take him with us."</P>
<P>"Yes," said Ambrose, "we must take him, or stay and die with him: while a hope remains of our dear father <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> arrival, we cannot leave St. Verrado."</P>
<P>"My dear children," said the Count d'Oresty, "your affection and gratitude charms, and interests me still more in your behalf; but rest assured, what∣ever may be the cause, that the vessel which you have reason to suppose deprived you of your friends, will never more return to St. Varrado. Don Lescar himself, nay, every inhabitant of this island, has relinquished all idea of it; who knows, therefore, Heaven may have preserved your friends; and that misfortune (if, as is generally believed the vessel has been captured) which may end in the destruction of the colony, may have brought life and liberty to them: but however this may be, you are as likely, if God permits, to meet them in other countries as in this."</P>
<P>Eleanor and Ambrose acknowledged the force of this argument, and were soon persuaded to enter into a me sure, which the Count assured them af∣forded a much greater probability of discovering
<PB N="137" REF="035098_0135_1000B6466794FAF8"/>
their friends than remaining at St. Verrado. They expressed their readiness to be guided by his advice, and enquired how he proposed to effect their escape?</P>
<P>The Count d'Oresty did not think proper at this time to disclose his plans; he only counselled Am∣brose to moderate his impetuosity, and keep up a friendly intercourse with Don Lescar; on which he told them the success of their enterprise would in a great measure depend: he then departed, telling them to attend every day at the port, and that when he had digested his plan, and arranged matters for its execution, he would talk more to them upon the subject.</P>
<P>Eleanor and Ambrose exactly followed the in∣structions of their friend: they attended regularly, at the port, but a week elapsed before they saw the Count d'Oresty; at length he accosted them: "Well, my children," said he, "do you think you shall have courage to trust yourselves once more on the seas in your little bark?"</P>
<P>"Ah, father," said Ambrose, "we commit ourselves wholly to your guidance; we have lost our dear Carlton, and think ourselves beyond mea∣sure
<PB N="138" REF="035098_0136_1000A3FF7A716530"/>
happy in meeting a friend to supply his place. We are very simple—we know nothing of the great world—It is you who must advise and direct us."</P>
<P>"Well, my children," said the Count d'Oresty, "God, who sees the purity of my intentions to∣ward you, will, I hope, direct me: we must en∣counter perils—"</P>
<P>"Talk not of perils," interrupted Ambrose; "tell us only what we must do—deliver us from Don Lescar—from this wicked place, since we must no longer indulge the hope of seeing our dear father."</P>
<P>"It is in your little bark, my children," said the Count, "that we must attempt our escape; I have examined it, and find it solid and well built; if we can once embark, I doubt not but I shall be able to steer so, as to land you on some shore in∣habited by beings less cruel than those among whom you now reside: from thence, if God spare me so long, I will convey you to England, where you may, perhaps, hear tidings of your friend; but much before remains to be done; your little bark, you see, is chained in the basin; the keys of the port must therefore be obtained or we cannot pro∣ceed in the enterprize. Do you think, Ambrose,
<PB N="139" REF="035098_0137_1000B6481A734550"/>
that you would have courage to enter the apartment of Don Lescar, and get possession of them?"</P>
<P>"I could have courage," said Ambrose, "to do any thing rather than live under a tyrant whom I despise and abhor—but how—"</P>
<P>"You must take them," said the Count, "from under the head of Don Lescar while he sleeps."</P>
<P>"Oh Heaven!" exclaimed Eleanor, "should he awake! my brother's life—"</P>
<P>"Be not alarmed, Eleanor," said the Count d'Oresty, follow exactly my directions, and all will be well. If the wind, Ambrose, continue in the same quarter as at present (for this will be necessary to observe, that it may blow us swiftly from the coast) towards evening feign an excuse to withdraw, and steal privately into the chamber of Don Lescar, where you must conceal yourself till he retires to rest."</P>
<P>"But," said Ambrose—"</P>
<P>"Hear me to an end," interupted the Count<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> "you, Eleanor, take this powder, and when Don Lescar has drunk a few glasses, watch a favoura∣ble opportunity, and drop a pinch of it into his
<PB N="140" REF="035098_0138_1000A409F1678988"/>
wine. It will first cause a drowsiness, which will probably induce him to repair to his chamber, and throw him into a deep sleep, during which, Am∣brose may, without danger of awaking him, take possession of the keys, which, when he retires to rest, are always placed beneath his pillow. Now, my children, if you have address and courage to execute this, you must immediately haste with the keys to this place, where I shall expect you, and be ready to perform what is farther necessary to the success of the enterprize."</P>
<P>The attempt was bold and hazardous; the exe∣cution of it, if not impossible, seemed difficult and replete with dangers; but Ambrose, transported with the hope of escaping from a country which he had in horror, and also with the thought of visiting England, where a probability remained of one day seeing his dearest friend, if he was still an inhabi∣tant of the earth, promised every thing. Eleanor, though alarmed for the safety of her brother, con∣sented to perform her part, and after some farther arrangements concerning the execution of the plan, they returned to the palace of the Governor.</P>
<P>Early in the evening, pursuant to the instructions of his friend, Ambrose, alledging indisposition,
<PB N="141" REF="035098_0139_1000A41636C93138"/>
withdrew from the presence of Don Lescar, and watching an opportunity, slipt privately into his chamber, and concealed himself behind the hang∣ings. He left Don Lescar, as usual, carousing among a number of his comrades, but as if Hea∣ven favoured the enterprize, on account of a slight indisposition which had afflicted him for some days, he dismissed them at an early hour. Eleanor watch∣ed a favourable opportunity, and, with a beating heart, dropt the powder given her by the Count d'Oresty into his glass. Don Lescar soon was sen∣sible of its power, and rising, retired to his cham∣ber. Let the Reader judge if possible what were the feelings of Eleanor at this moment; the idea of her brother being concealed in the chamber of Don Lescar, of the dangers to which he was expo∣sed, of the double part she had been acting, which obliged her to smile with pretended sincerity on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tyrant she was deceiving, all rushed forcibly on her mind; she threw herself into a chair, and bursting into an agony of tears, "Oh!" said she, what is to be compared with sincerity and truth! What advantages can be equivalent to the loss of it! Bet∣ter were it to have borne all the malice Don Lescar could have inflicted, than have entered into this la∣byrinth
<PB N="142" REF="035098_0140_1000B64A59104A50"/>
of deception; gracious heaven! should Don Lescar awake—should my brother be discovered—what will be the consequence—I tremble—merciful God protect him—save him—if we have done wrong, forgive us—Oh save him, save him, let not Eleanor lament her last, her only friend."</P>
<P>In the mean while Don Lescar entered his cham∣ber, and was scarcely stretched upon his bed, before, as the Count d'Oresty had foretold, he sunk into a deep sleep, and gave Ambrose, who boldly advan∣ced to the bed, an opportunity of seizing the keys, which, at this moment seemed to him a greater treasure than the wealth of the Indies. He then, as it had been agreed, stole to the apartment of his sister, who was ready to expire with joy upon seeing him safe out of the chamber of Don Lescar. Lit∣tle passed; he took her hand, and they escaped toge∣ther by a private door, of which Eleanor had the key: they flew immediately to the port where the Count d'Oresty anxiously expected the success of the undertaking. He no sooner behold the keys, than without staying to accost them or to disclose his in∣tentions, "Run, run, my friends," cried he to the guards, "the prison is on fire, and all the prison∣ers will escape." While he was speaking, a fright∣ful
<PB N="143" REF="035098_0141_1000B64C7744C9D8"/>
volume of smoke arose to the clouds: he had found means to set fire to a neighbouring arsenal in which the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pirates kept all their powder. The guards alarmed, quit their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, run to the conflagration, and afford the Count an opportunity of opening the palisades. Accompanied by his young friends, he precipitately enters the little bark, unchains it, and rows from land. It was not long before the Verra∣dian arsenal blew up, and made the Count easy res∣pecting the pursuit, which he was sensible would be made after them, should his absence or that of his young friends be discovered; but the universal alarm and confusion occasioned by the unexpected event, precluded all idea of an immediate pursuit.</P>
<P>A brisk gale blowing from land, our navigators lost no time in spreading the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail of their little ves∣sel. Eleanor, her eyes fixed upon the island, mo∣tionless with terror and astonishment, could not ut∣ter a single word: the Count d'Oresty and Am∣brose, mute also, bus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed themselves with flowing some provisions which the Count, a short time be∣fore he set fire to the arsenal, had found means to conceal in a retired spot at the foot of the pallisades, and with the assistance of Ambrose, had conveyed, after the retreat of the guards, into the vessel. Am∣brose
<PB N="144" REF="035098_0142_1000B64E014E1370"/>
first broke silence, "Whither are we going, father?" said he.</P>
<P>"Can I tell, my son?" said the Count, still confused with the events that had occurred in such quick succession to each other. "Let us get clear of this hated land, before we talk of our rout."</P>
<P>"Our island," said Eleanor, "cannot be far from hence."</P>
<P>"And what do you infer from that?" said the Count.</P>
<P>"I do not know," replied Eleanor, "but some∣how I have an idea that we should find our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dea Carlton there."</P>
<P>"Mere chimera, my child," said the Count; "No, we must not quit an inhabited for a desert land; we will direct our bark towards Cuba."</P>
<P>The bark rapidly out the waves, and in a short time they lost sight of St. Verrado; the night was dark, and neither moon nor stars was to be seen, but in a few hours the sun began to enlighten the east, and the Count perceived a number of small islands, which he had apparently coasted during the night
<PB N="145" REF="035098_0143_1000A40E36C60C88"/>
without knowing it; but the waves seeming to drive the bark with more violence, he was fearful of being driven into the Canal of Bahama (not doubting but that he was near it) the rapidity of which is so great, that it threatens instant destruction. In con∣sequence of this, by dint of oars and sails, they worked the vessel, and the next morning found them∣selves near a coast, which, from the form of the buildings, and the colours of the vessels that were in the port, the Count judged to belong to the English. How great was the joy of our voyagers? The ves∣sel made into the port, and they landed amidst a crowd of inhabitants, who put to them a thousand questions, which the singularity of their dress, and the peculiar form of their vessel, naturally excited: they soon, in their turn, learned that they were in the island of Providence, one of the Lucay Isles, situated upon the Canal of Bahama, that it belong∣ed to the English, that Sir James Corpley was the Governor, and that they might expect from his hu∣manity all the succour they could desire. This was joyful information; the islanders readily conducted them into the presence of the Governor; but what was the astonishment, the joy of Eleanor and Am∣brose, when, upon entering the apartment, they be∣held
<PB N="146" REF="035098_0144_1000B64F88DA3470"/>
their lost, their lamented friend, Colonel Carl∣ton! In an instant they were in his arms. "My children—my father—my protector," was alter∣nately repeated.</P>
<P>At length, becoming more calm, "to what unforeseen event, my children," said the Colonel, "do we owe this unexpected, this unhoped-for happiness?"</P>
<P>"Oh, my dear father," said Ambrose, "if God had not sent us this good friend (pointing to Count d'Oresty) who has risked his life for our sakes, we should never have been blest with beholding you; he has—"</P>
<P>At this moment, Peter, informed of what was passing, rushed precipitately into the apartment, and overcome by the excess of his joy, sunk, half faint∣ing, at the feet of his young friends. Ambrose and Eleanor were rejoiced at the sight of the good old man, and were not a little affected at seeing tears (though of joy) roll down his furrowed cheeks. They supported him in their arms, and endeavoured to calm his agitated spirits by a thousand tender ex∣pressions, which the gratitude and affection of their hearts dictated.</P>
<P>

<PB N="147" REF="035098_0145_1000B651B7F59F60"/>
Sir James Corpley, the Governor, seemed sin∣cerely to participate in their happi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> and invited the Count d'Oresty and his young friends to remain his guests during their residence in the island. The Colonel expressed his acknowledgments to the Count d'Oresty (whom he recollected formerly to have seen in England) for the attention he had shewn to his young pupils, and they all sat down to an ele∣gant repast, during which they had leisure to con∣verse, and recover from their fatigues. What a happiness to be thus re-united after the dangers they had encountered! They could not eat, they looked at each other, questioned, and made such a confu∣sion of their adventures, that the Governor request∣ed they would recount them in the order they had occurred, assuring them that he was already much interested in their fate, and wished only to know in what he could be serviceable to them. The request was no sooner made than complied with; the Colo∣nel began first, and related the circumstance of his shipwreck, and all that had happened during his re∣sidence in the uninhabited island; but as the Reader is already acquainted with these particulars, we will take up his narration only at the moment in which Ambrose and Eleanor left him to visit, for the last

time, the tomb of their friend Derley. "The children," said the Colonel, "had scarcely left me, when Peter, who was employed in stowing the pro∣visions in our little bark, suddenly cried out, a ves∣sel, Sir! a vessel!"</P>
<P>"A vessel, I replied, do you say?"</P>
<P>"Yes, Sir," said he, "it approaches, it makes rapidly for land."</P>
<P>"I immediately turned my eyes toward the sea, and saw a ship making towards us full sail. I can∣not exactly describe my sensations at the sight of an object so unexpected: my heart seemed to fink at the moment I was transported with joy; and, as if I foresaw the consequences, this event, so long and ardently wished for, disquieted, and even alarmed me. Friends o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> enemies, said I to Peter, let us meet them. Accordingly I walked to that part of the shore to which I saw the vessel making. In pre∣portion as it approached my fears diminished, and the Spanish colours which were hoisted, entirely removed them: I thought we might expect every necessary succour from a civilized nation of Europe; probably, in alliance with ours. The Spaniards soon came upon deck, and shortly after descended
<PB N="149" REF="035098_0147_1000A41490CA0CC8"/>
from the vessel, headed by their captain. "Is this island inhabited," said the Chief, in a surly tone of voice?</P>
<P>"No," I replied, "this is the first vessel we have seen touch here."</P>
<P>"And who are you?" said he, "what—"</P>
<P>"He was continuing, when one of his own peo∣ple, animated by a motive to which I was then a stranger, fired a pistol, which grazed his shoulder. "Ah, traitor," said the Chief, drawing another, "is it thus?—Die villain!"—Saying which, he fired upon the assassin, who escaped by turning aside his head, and was preparing to draw another pistol, (for they had each two at their girdle) when I, thoughtless of the consequences, imprudently snatch∣ed an iron crow from one of the men, and felled the assassin to the ground; I was immediately seiz∣ed, while a ball from another of the conspirators dispatched the unfortunate Chief."</P>
<P>Here Ambrose interrupted the Colonel, by ex∣claiming, "I was sure he did not kill him—"</P>
<P>"What do you say, my child?" said the Co∣lonel.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="035098_0148_1000B65560174D30"/>
"Oh, nothing," said Ambrose: "go on, fa∣ther, we will explain this afterward."</P>
<P>"The confusion," said the Colonel, resuming his narrative, "immediately became general; myself and Peter, who had attempted to defend me, were conveyed on board the vessel: in vain we called on you, my children, and entreated the pirates at least, to join yours to our unfortunate destiny; sole∣ly occupied with the desperate act they had just com∣mitted, they embarked precipitately, without pay∣ing any regard to our prayers, inhumanly put us in irons, and confined us with a dozen unfortunate women, prisoners like ourselves. I need not des∣cribe the horror of our situation, separated from you, my children, and slaves without knowing our masters. Toward the middle of the night, some coarse food was thrown into our dungeon, and in the morning six sailors handcuffed, were added to our miserable society: from these we learned the motives that had given rise to the horrid scene trans∣acted on the island, and also the cause of their own detention. The prisoners confined with us belonged a few days before, to a French merchantman, which had been attacked and taken by the pirates. George Blake, the late Commander, being dissatisfied with
<PB N="151" REF="035098_0149_1000B656EA8139C0"/>
the little courage shewn by his comrades in the action, reproached them severely, and formally signified to them that they should not have any share of the boo∣ty: this highly incensed them, and one of the number, named Burney, formed a conspiracy with the others to assassinate their Chief on the first favourable op∣portunity that should offer, to go to St. Domingo or Cuba, sell their booty, and return to England, there to live quietly on their ill-gotten wealth. The plot was ripe for execution, when Blake, struck with the unexpected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight of our island, either from curiosity or the hope of booty, descended upon it. The rest explained itself, the unfortunate Chief was assassi∣nated, and we made prisoners: But, said I to the sailor who gave us this information, how is it that you are handcuffed and confined? are you not their friends? No, said the sailor, we refused to join in the conspiracy against our Chief, who was a generous, brave man, undeserving the fate he met with: they are afraid lest we, in our turn, should form a con∣spiracy against them, and it is on this account they confine us. And to what port, said I, are we now going? It is of little importance to us, said the sai∣lor, for a council has this day deen held in which it was probably agreed to massacre us all. Barbari∣ans! we exclaimed with one accord. It is their cus∣tom,
<PB N="152" REF="035098_0150_1000B6588196EBE0"/>
said the sailor, the French merchant ship they took yesterday was sunk with all the men it contain∣ed, after they had pillaged the cargo, and taken out these unhappy women, whom the will now proba∣bly sacrifice, as they do not return to the colony to which their vessel was bound.</P>
<P>"The women, upon this horrid recital, broke in∣to violent lamentations: as for me, I patiently wait∣ed for death, which no longer appeared un welcome, after I had lost all that could render life desirable.</P>
<P>"The vessel continued its course till towards the middle of the next day, when it was on a sudden vi∣olently agitated, and we judged from the noise of cannon which assailed us on every side, that the pi∣rates were engaged with another vessel, which, by the size of the balls that struck us, some of our com∣panions judged to be of superior force. I need not describe our anxiety during the engagement, which lasted about two hours; hope and fear alternate∣ly possessed us; at length our trap opened, and a strange voice exclamed, <HI>You are free!</HI> immediately our irons were taken off, and we were put on board another vessel, which proved to be English. The pirates had attempted to give chace to the English, but the Captain had made use of his superiority to at∣tack
<PB N="153" REF="035098_0151_1000A41B14C4E500"/>
them; they had fought, it was said, desperate∣ly, and did not strike to the English till the greater part of their men were killed. We learnt farther that the Captain was charged with dispatches from the English Government to its American possessions, and that he would first touch at the Isle of Provi∣dence, to the Governor of which he had letters of recall. Thus from slavery and death were we unex∣pectedly restored to life and freedom: I made my∣self known, and communicated my story to the Cap∣tain, who, upon our arrival at the Isle of Provi∣dence, presented me to Sir James Corpley, the Governor, with whom I had been formerly intimate in England: his reception was such as might have been expected from the most generous of men; he was interested in my misfortunes, and since that time has detained me his distinguished guest: but an im∣portant expedition is now in agitation; six of the Verradian prisoners, intimidated by the threats, and allured by the promises of the Governor, have con∣fessed the situation of the island they inhabit, and in a few days, four hundred men, of which Sir James has given me the command, will embark, to extir∣pate this horde of robbers, and take possession of the island in the name of the English Monarch: But do
<PB N="154" REF="035098_0152_1000A422AD325000"/>
not think, my children, said the Colonel to Ambrose and Eleanor, that I was unmindful of your situation; I had permission from my friend to touch at our island, little suspecting that you had ventured to abandon it."</P>
<P>The Colonel thus terminated his recital, and re∣ceived the thanks of all present. Ambrose then recounted all that had happened since his seperation from the Colonel; and his recital was continued by the Count d'Oresty, whose courage and exerti∣ons, in behalf of the amiable orphans were univer∣sally applauded. The Colonel again thanked him in the warmest terms, and a friendship from that moment took place between them, which continued to the end of their lives. The generous Governor congratulated his guests in the most polite and friendly terms upon their re-union, appointed by Providence to take place in his island, which on this occasion, he observed, justified its name.</P>
<P>The happiness of Eleanor and Ambrose would have been complete, had it not been embittered by the thought of a second separation form their friend, on account of the expedion to St. Verrado; Am∣brose earnestly entreated to be permitted to accom∣pany him, but the tears of his sister, and the com∣mands of the Colonel, to which he had been ac∣customed
<PB N="155" REF="035098_0153_1000B65B6262CF88"/>
implicity to submit, at length prevailed, and he relinquished his request. The Count d'Oresty, notwithstanding his age, made one in the expedition, justly considering that his knowledge of the island might forward the success of the undertaking. Eleanor and Ambrose accompanied their friends to the port, and with their eyes followed the little fleet, (consisting of three ships) till they could no longer distinguish it: they then returned with heavy hearts to the Governor, who used all his arguments to mitigate their sears for the safety of their friends, and to inspire them with the hope of their safe and speedy return.</P>
<P>It seemed as if Heaven favoured the expedition against St. Verrado; the weather continued favour∣able, and at the end of three days, towards mid∣night, the little fleet arrived before the island; the whole colony was buried in sleep, except the gaurds, who watched before the palisades, to pre∣vent any one mounting the bank, and entering the vessels.</P>
<P>The six Verradians (who, by the promise of liberty and a high reward, had been prevailed up∣on to enter into the plot) were dispatched in the long boat, and having entered the port, made
<PB N="156" REF="035098_0154_1000A4212A781DB8"/>
themselves known to the sentinels, whom they amused with a false recital of their adventures, while the Colonel and his men, favoured by the darkness of the night, scaled the palisades, fell up∣on, and out them to pieces before they had time to sound the alarm or to defend themselves. One of the guards, however, escaping, ran to the city, rang the alarm, and roused the inhabitants, who scarcely awake, knew not what they meant, nor what enemies they had to encounter. The English dispersed in the streets, attacked the Verradians, as they came out of their houses, and lighted brands soon set fire to the four corners of the city. Don Lescar astonished, thunderstruck at this sudden at∣tack, at length assembled about two hundred men, and advanced in order for battle: the slaughter soon became horrible; on one side, the English, armed with swords and bayonets, on the other, the Ver∣radians vigorously defending themselves with enorm∣ous masses of bamboo<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The bamboo here spoken of is not that of the East-Indies, which we frequently see converted in∣to walking canes.

<PB N="157" REF="035098_0155_1000B65CE7FE4800"/>
utmost horror and confusion. In the mean time, the besieged, little formed for combat, enervated by luxury and pleasure, first gave ground; and to ren∣der their defeat complete, a hundred men, which were left for that purpose in the ships, bombarded the city, and razed the citadel, the construction of which was not very solid.</P>
<P>In this expedition the English lost twenty men, and the Verradians nearly three hundred men and women; for the women, laying aside the timidity of their sex, armed with bamboos and stakes, rush∣ed into the midst of the battle, and fell fighting be∣side their husbands. In the midst of the carnage fell the proud Don Lescar, by the hand of the Count d'Oresty: the rest of the inhabitants having demand∣ed quarter, the English chiefs caused the slaughter to cease, and stopped the progress of the fire. Day, at length returned to discover the disasters of the
<PB N="158" REF="035098_0156_1000B65E7566BEF0"/>
night, and the Colonel satisfied with his expedition, thought of re-imbarking with his prisoners: but what was his consternation! not a single vessel, not a single boat was to be seen in the basin. The men who were left with the little fleet, had dispersed them∣selves over the city to assist their people, and the treacherous Verradians had seized this unguarded moment to set fire to the ships, as well to their own as to those of the English. Both Colonel Carlton and the Count d'Oresty had heard the explosion caus∣ed by the blowing up of the magazines of powder; they had distinguished the Heavens red with the re∣flection of the flames; but in the heat of combat, in the confusion that universally reigned, they had attri∣buted all to the conflagration of the city, which made a rapid progress. An event so unexpected, did not a little embarrass and mortify the Colonel; he saw himself deprived of means to return to the Isle of Pro∣vidence, where he had left his beloved pupils, and from whence he hoped shortly to embark for Eng∣land. Besides this, he was wholly destitute of shel∣ter, or any thing necessary to feed and lodge nearly four hundred of his own men, and upwards of three hundred prisoners. He was constrained, however, to accommodate himself to these difficulties, and as the only part there remained for him to take, order∣ed
<PB N="159" REF="035098_0157_1000B6600BF6B2C8"/>
the houses that were saved from the flames to be searched for sail cloth, cables and tools necessary to construct a vessel. These were happily found, and the carpenters immediately set to work. They la∣boured without intermission day and night, and at the end of six weeks launched two little barks, un∣worthy the name of ships, sufficient to contain the Colonel and about two hundred of his men, with whom he resolved to embark, leaving the residue to guard the Verradian prisoners. He took with him also twenty-five unfortunate women, who had long groaned in the prisons of St. Verrado. But before we take leave of St. Verrado, we must acquaint the reader with an interesting event, that occurred during the Colonel's continuance in the island. One day having visited different parts of the city that had escaped the ravages of the flames, a Verradian, who was with him, pointed to the house of their old com∣mander, George Blake, as the largest and best built in all the colony, excepting the Governor's. Curi∣osity induced the Colonel to enter it; he ascended into an upper chamber, and observing a small cabi∣net, forced it open to examine the contents. These were a few jewels, and several parcels of letters and papers, which he perused with little attention, till the following attracted his notice.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="035098_0158_1000A4282B650628"/>
<Q>Why, my dear Eleanor, must I deceive the best of fathers! Why is he blinded by ambition? Are not virtues, titles of nobility, and the quali∣ties of the heart, inestimable treasures? Oh, my wife, my children, why must I not own you? Why must you not find shelter in the arms of my venerable, my much respected father! but it can∣not be. Make every thing ready for your depar∣ture; I confide you to safe hands; Derley accom∣panies you, and my heart is easy; kiss my Elea∣nor and Ambrose a thousand times for me: how young they are to encounter the fatigues of so long a voyage! but Heaven and the tender cares of a mother will protect them. I shall find you all at Charles Town. Adieu, embark without unea∣siness, assured that nothing but death shall pre∣vent an affectionate husband from soon joining you.</Q></P>
<P>The Colonel did not, the Reader will conclude, unmoved peruse a letter, which, upon a comparison, evidently appeared to be written by the same hand as that found upon Derley; the date was nearly the same, but it had no signature. He now searched every part of the cabinet with the minutest attention, and at last drew from a private drawer a picture of
<PB N="161" REF="035098_0159_1000A4538C5F9E28"/>
the most interesting nature: it represented a beautiful young woman holding two children; "It is Elea∣nor! It is Ambrose!" The Colonel called to mind their features at the time he first entered the uninha∣bited island, and traced the resemblance undimi∣nished by the years that had then elapsed. Eleanor was the exact resemblance of her mother; Am∣brose, more masculine, was building a house of cards, upon which was written, "<HI>telle est la vie.</HI>" What an interesting discovery! The features of the woman (though fresh and lively) upon a compari∣son, evidently resembled those delineated in the gold box of Derley; but still it threw no light upon the birth of his pupils. As he viewed the interesting miniture, a thousand different ideas rushed upon his mind: By what means did these precious deposits fall into the hands of the pirate? Could it be possi∣ble his amiable pupils were the offspring of a wretch so depraved; or had he plundered and destroyed their unfortunate parents? His mind floated be∣tween these two ideas, when a letter, written in a woman's hand, presented itself, and threw some light upon the matter: it was as follows:</P>
<P><Q>At length, barbarian, I break the bonds in which you have for six months held me, and re∣turn
<PB N="162" REF="035098_0160_1000B66331B1A248"/>
to my country; but, alas! I return desolate and wretched, deprived by thy merciless hand of of all that could render life desireable. Detested wretch! where are my poor children? my Elea∣nor, my Ambrose? in what corner of the earth hast thou concealed them? Derley, the friend, the confidant of my husband, the only support of an unfortunate woman, is no more—Ah, without doubt, my children sleep with him in the night of the tomb. Oh, insupportable, reflecti∣on! I can no more; the moment is favourable, and I depart: but tremble, villain, the ven∣of a just God will pursue thee, and deliver the earth from a monster who contaminates it.</Q></P>
<P>This letter evidently had a correspondence with the former; the names and date were the same, and upon a calculation, the Colonel found the time nearly approached the period in which his pupils were left upon the Island: he no longer doubted, though ignorant by what means, but their misfor∣tunes originated from this villain, to whom it ap∣peared, by the superscription, the letter was ad∣dressed. Hoping to make farther discoveries, he enquired very particularly among the Verradians concerning their naval Chief, hoping from thence
<PB N="163" REF="035098_0161_1000A42DECC77C58"/>
to draw some conclusions, but he was disappoint∣ed; all that he could learn was, that George Blake was the Captain of an English vessel, who upon some misdemeanor had been outlawed; that having rendered services to Don Lescar, and, at last, assist∣ed him in making his escape, the closest intimacy had existed between them, and that he was consi∣dered as the most daring and enterprizing of all the pirates. Not being able to gain any farther infor∣mation, the Colonel secured the letters and picture, and embarked for the Isle of Providence. After five days sail they arrived there, and were received with universal joy by the Governor and the whole island, but especially by Eleanor and Ambrose, who, alarmed at an absence so much longer than was expected, began to fear both the Colonel and the Count d'Oresty had fallen victims to the fury of Don Lescar; but their friends were returned, and all sorrow was banished.</P>
<P>The arrival of the Colonel with his suite, and the news of the victory, was celebrated with univer∣sal demonstrations of joy; the brave soldiers who fought under him were generously recompensed, as well as the six Verradians who had been instrumen∣tal to the victory. The three hundred prisoners ta∣ken
<PB N="164" REF="035098_0162_1000B664B64AC9D8"/>
at St. Verrado were sent to the Governor of the Spanish island of St. Domingo, as also a parti∣cular account of the expedition.</P>
<P>Sir James Corpley, who was fond of splendid entertainments, gave one at which the soldiers who were sent on the expedition to St. Verrado, and the unfortunate persons released from its prisons were present; nor could a sight more interesting be con∣ceived than this social union of the heroes and the unfortunate persons delivered by their valour.</P>
<P>The reader will recollect that the vessel which delivered Colonel Carlton from the hands of the pi∣rates bore letters of recall to the Governor of the Isle of Providence. As soon, therefore, as he had settled the affairs of the island, as appointed by Government, he embarked for the British Isles, ac∣companied by Colonel Carlton, the Count d'Oresty, Eleanor and Ambrose, and the faithful Peter. With respect to the prisoners released from the dungeons of St. Verrado, some of them settled in the Island of Providence, and the rest returned to their different countries.</P>
<P>What now could exceed the happiness of Elea∣nor and Ambrose! returning to their country under
<PB N="165" REF="035098_0163_1000B66640AFCBE8"/>
the conduct of their dear protector and the Count d'Oresty. The weather was favourable; the vessel arrived happily in port, and our voyagers being fur∣nished with cloaths and every thing necessary to make their appearance as natives in England, set out post for the metropolis. It is not easy to form a just idea of the sensations of Colonel Carlton upon his arrival in a country which he had not seen for more than twelve years, and which contained trea∣sures, to him, of inestimable value. The different revolutions that might have occurred in so long a space of time naturally presented themselves to his mind, and alternately agitated him with hope and fear: he had left a wife and child whom he tender∣ly loved—but death might long since have consign∣ed them to the grave; or a second marriage, upon the supposition of his death, might have embittered the remainder of his days. As he drew near Lon∣don his fears encreased, and while every one was elate with joy and gladness, he was melancholy and dejected. Upon his arrival, he went immedi∣ately to the house of a relation, where he was in∣formed that since his supposed death, Mrs. Carlton had retired to a villa a few miles from the metropolis,
<PB N="166" REF="035098_0164_1000A430F1B16B98"/>
where, with her son, she lived wholly secluded from the great world. How grateful was this to the heart of the Colonel! Accompanied by his two pupils and the Count d'Oresty, he immediately set out for the village, and towards evening arrived at an inn about a mile from the house where Mrs. Carlton resided. Here he alighted and remained with Ambrose and Eleanor while the Count d'Oresty took upon himself the necessary office of preparing Mrs. Carlton for his reception. He introduced himself to her as a friend of the Colonel's, and mentioned at a distance a report of a few having been preserved from the wreck; then having inspir∣ed her with hope, he ventured to tell her that letters had been received from some of the crew; but when he announced the certainty of her husband's safety, and, at last, that he was actually in Eng∣land, notwithstanding the caution with which it had been revealed, her surprize and joy was so great, that the Count did not think it prudent to acquaint her he was so near, but contented himself, as the day was far advanced, with promising her an inter∣view the next morning. The description he gave the Colonel, on his return to the inn, of his Lady's emotions on the unexpected news of his arrival, af∣forded him heart-felt pleasure.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="035098_0165_1000B667C5C53BE0"/>
The next morning early, the whole group was assembled at the mansion of Mrs. Carlton, who was already up, and, with her son, a promissing youth of sixteen, impatiently a waiting the arrival of her husband. The meeting was too affecting to admit of description: the Colonel alternately pressed to his bosom his wife and son, and in the excess of hap∣piness he enjoyed, forgot the years of anguish that were passed, or remembered them only to heighten his present joy. The first transports of meeting be∣ing over, the Colonel presented Eleanor and Am∣brose to his lady, telling her with a smile, they were his adopted children, and that he hoped and trusted she would not find them undeserv∣ing her protection. The esteem of the Colo∣nel was a sufficient recommendation to Mrs. Carl∣ton; though unacquainted with their story, she cor∣dially embraced, and presented them to her son Charles, who assured his father he should from that moment consider them as his brother and sister. In her turn, Mrs. Carlton introduced to the Colonel, by the name of Millar, a worthy clergyman, who had undertaken the care of their son's education, as also a gentlewoman, about the age of thirty five, as the companion of her widowed hours. "Had it
<PB N="168" REF="035098_0166_1000A43406DED9A0"/>
not been for my worthy friend," said she, "I must have sunk under the weight of my affliction; but her example taught me fortitude a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d resignation; I looked for consolation to religion, and to a happy eternity, for the felicity I despaired of tasting here."</P>
<P>The joy of Eleanor and Ambrose, on seeing their generous protector thus happily re-united to his fami∣ly, was such as might be expected from the suscepti∣bility of their hearts: their eye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s were alternately fix∣ed upon the Colonel, Mrs. Carlton, and Charles, never wearied with contemplating the happiness that was expressed in the countenance of each. The Count d'Oresty, and all present, shared in the gene∣ral joy; and it was not, perhaps, possible to find a happier group than that assembled at the breakfast∣table of Mrs. Carlton. The adventures of the Colo∣nel, at length, became the topic of conversation, and at the request of his Lady and friends, he re∣counted the principal events that had occurred since he left England; he mentioned his shipwreck on the uninhabited island, his discovery of Eleanor and Ambrose, and did not forget the many little incidents that occurred to illustrate the goodness and simplicity of their hearts. This part of the narrative seemed to make a singular impression on the Lady, whom Mrs.
<PB N="169" REF="035098_0167_1000B66A99D743D0"/>
Carlton had introduced <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> her companion and friend during the absence of her husband; she lost not a word, and more than once her eyes were observed to be dim with tears; but when the name of Derley was mentioned, her countenance underwent a total alteration; she grew pale, and casting her eyes round with a wildness that alarmed every one pre∣sent, requested to see the letter and box found upon him. The Colonel produced them; and the stran∣ger immediately exclaimed, "My children!" and fell back senseless in her chair. All arose in haste to give the necessary assistance; she revived; and Eleanor and Ambrose, no longer doubting but they had found their mother, threw themselves on their knees before her: "Yes," said she, bending on them an eye of tender scrutiny, "it is my Eleanor—my Ambrose too! the living image of his lament∣ed father; my heart from the first moment I beheld him, pointed out the resemblance; but could I think!'—and here she stopped, overcome with sen∣sations too great for words to express. Ambrose and Eleanor, while alternately embraced by their mother, mingled tears of gratitude and affection with those she shed over them. The striking resemblance (allowing for the difference of years) between Elea∣nor and her mother, was now universally observed,
<PB N="170" REF="035098_0168_1000A43C2C492880"/>
and every one wondered it had not before struck him; yet an event so far exceeding the bounds of human probability, could scarcely obtain credit from any, excepting Mrs. Carlton, who, being acquaint∣ed with the story of her friend, entertained no doubt but that Providence had re-united her to her children. To remove every doubt, the Colonel pro∣duced the letters and picture he had found in the house of George Blake; these were immediately known by Mrs. Carlton's friend, who being suffici∣ently recovered, satisfied the company, by relating the particulars of her history. Her words were as follow:—</P>
<P>"I am the daughter of an officer; my father was descended from an ancient family, but inherited on∣ly a small patrimony; he had served many cam∣paigus, but soon after the death of my mother, re∣tired from the army in disgust upon a small annuity: this, from the embarrassments of the person in whose hands it was placed, after a few years ceased, and my father, at an advanced age, found himself reduc∣ed to a poverty, his high spirit was ill formed to brook.</P>
<P>"Our support depended chiefly upon a young man, an orphan, whom my father in happier days
<PB N="171" REF="035098_0169_1000B66C1E0C5A30"/>
had brought up and placed with a jeweller: forgive the tear I shed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his memory; to me his affec∣tion was that of the kindest brother; to my father, of the most duteous and affectionate son. Derley shared with us the pittance he obtained by industry, which, joined to the little I gained from my needle, preser∣ed us from the extremities of want. But greater dis∣tress soon followed; Derley, from a variety of in∣cidents too tedious to relate, and some debts he had contracted on our account, was thrown into a pri∣son, and my father who was reduced by a long ill∣ness, grew so bad, that his life was despaired of. Overwhelmed by this accumulated distress, I was one evening returning with some work from a shop that employed me, when, in passing through a retir∣ed street, I could not forbear giving vent to my tears, which in the presence of my father I felt my∣self obliged to suppress; but I cannot describe to you how much I was humbled and confused, upon ob∣serving that my grief had drawn upon me the notice of a young man, who, as I afterward found, had for some time followed me. He addressed me in the most respectful terms, and enquired into the cause of my grief, adding, "Do not suppose that any other motive than concern for the unfortunate prompts my curiosity, perhaps I may alleviate your distress.
<PB N="172" REF="035098_0170_1000B66DD84D5810"/>
I replied, that my grief was not of a nature for him to alleviate, and that the only favour he could do me was to suffer me to pass unnoticed. Saying this, I quickned my pace; but the stranger still following urged me, though in terms of great delicacy, to ac∣cept his friendship, at the same time offering me his purse. Great as our distress was, I was not yet sufficiently humbled to accept of pecuniary relief from a stranger; nor, indeed, would prudence have permitted it: I returned the thanks due to his gene∣rosity, but refused to accept any thing, and being arrived at our own door, wished him a good night. Upon entering, I found that an alarming change had taken place in my dear father, who survived only till the next evening. You who have hearts alive to the feelings of humanity can better imagine than I can describe my situation: deprived of a father whom I regretted, not only as the parent who had given me birth, but as the friend who had guided my youth; Derley, my only remaining friend, absent, languishing in a prison, unable either to console or advise me! I was overwhelmed with the weight of these afflictions, when the unexpected entrance of Derly, for a moment, suspended my grief; my heart gathered strength from the presence of my best friend, and I arose to communicate, in terms of as
<PB N="173" REF="035098_0171_1000B66F81587B80"/>
much gentleness as my own grief would permit, the loss we had mutually sustained. Derley was shock∣ed and affected to tears; for some moments he gave vent to the emotions of his grateful heart, and then turning to me, endeavoured to give me the consolation he himself wanted: at length we became more calm, and I enquired by what unexpected means he had obtained his release? He replied that a generous stranger, of whose name and quality he was ignorant, had by some means gained intelligence of his mis∣fortunes, paid the debt, and enclosed for him a bank∣note of ten pounds. The idea of the stranger who had accosted me the preceding evening, immediately rush∣ed upon my mind; I communicated to Derley what had passed between us, and he agreed with me that it might be the same, though we were at a loss to conceive how he had gained the knowledge of our situation.</P>
<P>"Having performed the last melancholy duties to my dear father's remains, I began to think of look∣ing out for a situation in which I might provide for my own subsistence, sensible that I could not long with propriety remain under the protection of Der∣ley. About a week after the funeral of my father,

<PB N="174" REF="035098_0172_1000B672A4394CD8"/>
the generous stranger introduced himself to Derley, as a friend willing to render him any father servi∣ces his situation might require: I was present, and knowing him to be the same that had accosted me, could not do less than express myself obliged by his civilities. Upon enquiring, we learnt that he had obtained a knowledge of our situation from the woman in whose house we lodged. From this time he called often, and his visits at last became so frequent, that Derley, the watchful guardian of my youth, was alarmed, and would absolutely have forbidden them, had not the stranger, foresee∣ing his intentions, professed his views to be honour∣able. Young and unexperienced, I too readily listened to his addresses, thoughtless of the obstacles that must attend our union, for we soon learnt that our benefactor was the only son of the Count d'¦Oresty, the Ambassador from France."</P>
<P>The Colonel and his pupils at this moment turned their eyes upon their venerable friend with surprize and enquiry; nor was the Count himself unmoved. The mother of Eleanor and Ambrose stopped—but the Count looking significantly at the rest, and making a sign that she should go on, she continued. "Thoughtless of the consequences,
<PB N="175" REF="035098_0173_1000A4432EC9EF90"/>
instead of restraining my inclinations, and setting before M. d'Oresty the duties he owed his father, and the evils that must attend his disobedience, I listened to his addresses, and consented to a private marriage, foolishly amusing myself with the hope that he would find means to reconcile his father to the imprudent step he had taken. A house was hired in a retired part of the town, and we lived together in mutual harmony; but happiness was far from being our guest; the idea of the troubles in which I was sensible I must involve my husband, should his father, who I now understood inherited all the pride of high birth and designed him for ano∣ther, prove inflexible, continually alarmed, and made me wretched. These reflections, which I ought to have made before it had been too late, un∣dermined my peace, though they did not repair my errors. A few months after our marriage, I ob∣served a gloom on the countenance of my husband, and enquiring the cause, he told me that his father, having learnt that a connexion existed between us, had declared that if it tended to marriage, he would certainly disinherit him. This entirely frustrated his design of disclosing his marriage, which he now thought it necessary more closely to conceal: our
<PB N="176" REF="035098_0174_1000B6742B46DB80"/>
residence was changed, and soon after I brought into the world twins; my Eleanor and Ambrose were born. More than three years elapsed, and all suspi∣cion of our union had died away when my husband one evening returned with the dreadful tidings that his father had ordered him to embark in a few weeks for France, to forward his nuptials with the daughter of the French minister, for whom he had from his infancy been designed. I need not tell you the anguish this communicated to my heart, nor was my poor d'Oresty less affected: I wept, and my husband, who well knew the inflexibility of his father, had scarcely a word of consolation to offer me. We parted that evening without re∣solving upon any thing, but the next, he met me with the appearance at least of more serenity; he told me that finding it impossible without the utter ruin of us all to discover his marriage to his father, he could think of no way but to embark immedi∣ately for South Carolina, and solicit the interfe∣rence of an uncle who resided there, and who had great influence with his father. The tender age of my children made me alive to all the perils and fa∣tigues they must encounter; I represented these to M. d'Oresty, and endeavoured to dissuade him from
<PB N="177" REF="035098_0175_1000B675B29EB1C8"/>
the voyage, especially as I conceived the interfer∣ence of his uncle might be equally as well obtained by letter; but poor d'Oresty thought otherwise; he imagined that his uncle, and every one must see with the eyes he did, and thought the presence of his wife and children would plead more powerfully than volumes. His first design was to embark with us, but the difficulty he found in disengaging himself, without creating suspicions which he wish∣ed to avoid, made him relinquish the idea, and it was determined that I should embark with the chil∣dren and Derley, and await his arrival at Charles-Town. Finding that his heart was set upon the voyage, I submitted, and in less than three weeks set out under the conduct of Derley, with the children and a female servant, for Plymouth, from whence we were to embark with the first fair wind. The letter you found in the pocket of poor Derley I re∣ceived from my husband the day before we left London.</P>
<P>"As the winds were contrary, upon our arrival at Plymouth, we took up our residence at the inn, where we remained above a week; during this time we had frequent visits from the Captain of the ves∣sel

in which we were to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail; indeed, he intruded oftener than was agreeable to me, but attributing all to his wish of obliging, and the partiality of a mother being flattered by the attention he paid the children, I passed it o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er in silence and embarked without suspicion of danger. We had not been many days at sea before I observed a familiarity in his manners that disgusted me; but judge what was my indignation when he had the presumption to profess a passion for me. I retorted in the language my wounded pride dictated and the insult deserv∣ed; to which he, with the utmost coolness return∣ed "that the offer of his hand, which he freely made me could not be construed into an insult, especially as I must consider that he was sole master in the ves∣sel, and consequently that I was in his power," I now saw the villain I had to deal with, and pro∣fitting by the hint that I was in his power, I en∣deavoured to remonstrate with less <HI>haut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur,</HI> repre∣senting to him, that being already the wife of ano∣ther, I could not listen to his proposals, however honourable or advantageous they might be." I had no sooner said this, than he drew from his pocket a letter, and putting it, with a sarcastic smile into my hand, told me that I should see he wished to

<P>All our plans are frustrated—I am mortally wounded—if this meets you, lose not a mo∣ment—set off instantly for London, (the bearer will conduct you) that I may have the satisfacti∣on of leaving you under the protection of my father.—There is no time to dissemble.

</LETTER>
<P>I will not attempt to describe what I felt upon reading this letter; my anguish arose to a pitch that bordered upon madness. When I cast my eyes round, and saw myself shut out from the possibility of flying to my husband, and learnt, that had it not been for the blackest treachery, I might have arrived time enough to have taken a last farewell of him; for Blake made no scruple of confessing, that though I was on board when the messenger arrived, we had not weighed anchor, attributing what he had done to
<PB N="180" REF="035098_0178_1000B67BB8F65DF0"/>
the violence of his passion, as he understood from the messenger whom he had accosted upon the beech, that it contained an express for me to return to London. For some hours I actually lost the use of my reason, which so alarmed the wretch who per∣secuted me, that he left me to the care of Derley, who in vain strove to soothe and reconcile me to my misfortunes. Time, however, and the tender cares of a mother, affected what argument could not; my reason returned, and the innocent prattle of my chil∣dren diverted my thoughts from a calamity, the re∣collection of which drove me almost to phrenzy; but I had more yet to endure. I was again persecuted by the odious addresses of Blake, from which Der∣ley in vain endeavoured to defend me. He grew impatient, and to intreaties added threats of the most horrid nature. Alarmed at my situation, I endea∣voured to dissemble, thinking, that when we arrived at Charles-Town, the place to which the vessel was bound, I should easily rid myself of his importuni∣ties. He, however, more skilled in artifice than I was, saw through my drift, and finding that Derley would ever remain an obstacle to his views, he re∣solved to be rid of him at the first opportunity: nor was this all; my innocent children became the ob∣jects
<PB N="181" REF="035098_0179_1000A44A27A95DB8"/>
of his detestation, from the supposition, I con∣clude, that they kept alive in my heart the remem∣brance of their father; at least I can assign no other reason for the dreadful scene I am going to relate. We had been at sea about seven weeks, when one morning as I was sitting with my children, one on one knee, and the other on the other, weeping, and talking with Derley on the events that were past, Blake came into the cabin: he renewed the usual theme, mingling threats with promises, till finding I paid no attention to his discourse, but still wept on, and embraced my children, he suddenly started up, and snatching them from my arms, threw them with violence on the floor. Derley, who was attached to the children, incensed at this act of brutality, yield∣ing to the impulse of the moment, seized him by the throat; an affront which Blake revenged by drawing a short sword, and stabbing him, as I thought, to the heart. At the instant, five or six men came in∣to the cabin, and at a signal given, seized Derley, while others, notwithstanding my prayers, tears, and frantic endeavours to prevent it, bore away the children. What were all my former troubles to the anguish of this moment! I fancied I heard the cries of my children under the hands of their murderers,
<PB N="182" REF="035098_0180_1000B67D4317FE00"/>
yet was unable to fly to their rescue; I endeavoured to force the door of the cabin, but finding my efforts vain, I sunk down insensible and remember no more till I found myself on my bed, my servant sitting by me. I called aloud for my children, my Ambrose—my Eleanor, and was in vain assured that they were in safety—that they were left with Derley on an island we had coasted; I gave no credit to the tale, believing it fabricated merely to amuse me, especi∣ally as I found my servant was in the interest of Blake. I will not trouble you with all I suffered dur∣ing the voyage; suffice it to say, that we arrived at Charles-Town, where I hoped to escape the ty∣ranny of my persecutor, but I was mistaken; un∣der the pretence that I was his niece, and deranged in my intellects, he conveyed me to his house, and committed me to the care of my treacherous servant, whom he had suborned to his interest. Six months I was closely confined, but at the end of that time, through the assistance of an honest labourer who worked in grounds adjacent, I effected my escape, and having fortunately concealed about my person bank notes to the amount of a hundred and fifty pounds, engaged for my passage in a vessel that was on the point of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ailing for England.</P>

"You will, perhaps, think that my first step ought to have been that of communicating my story to the magistrates of the town, and claiming their protecti∣on; but if you knew what I had suffered, how much my spirits were depressed, and what reason I had to dread the machinations of the wretch by whom I was persecuted, you will cease to wonder at my conduct. My sole object was to return to England, either to meet my husband, (which seemed within the bounds of possibility) or to die there in obscurity.</P>
<P>With these ideas I embarked; but on my arrival soon learnt, as I had reason to presage, that my hus∣band was no more. He expired, as far as I could judge from the vague information I collected, a few hours after the messenger was dispatched to me; e∣ven before the arrival of his father, who set off for Bath on the morning on which the duel was fought. I learnt also, that the Count d'Oresty, in conse∣quence of his affliction, had solicited his recall, and had returned to France a few weeks after the death of his son.</P>
<P>"All my hopes of happiness were now at an end, and I resolved, in some quiet family, to seek an hum∣ble establishment, where I could perform the duties of my station, and prepare for the quitting of a world
<PB N="184" REF="035098_0182_1000B6818D3122E0"/>
which had for me no longer any charms. The person at whose house I lodged, understanding my intention, mentioned a lady, who she said was on the point of retiring into the country, and wanted a person capable of being a companion, and at the same time of assisting in the management of her fa∣mily. Need I say that it was my dear Mrs. Carlton? I was introduced to her and immediately engaged. In due time I related to her my unhappy story, and experienced her generous sympathy: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>she treated me with the affection of a sister, and could I have for∣gotten my children—my husband—my friend—torn from me by the most perverse and cruel destiny, I might have been happy. She pressed me to make myself known to the family of my husband, offered me money for the purpose, nay would have accom∣panied me to France; but I declined her generous offers; I knew not whether the father of my hus∣band was acquainted with his indiscretions, and as I had not children to prompt my ambition, or to call forth my exertions, I wished not to fully his me∣mory with the revival of follies which originated on∣ly in his too great partiality for me. Twelve years have passed, not unprofitably away; religion has taught me to moderate both my griefs and my
<PB N="185" REF="035098_0183_1000B68314CFE180"/>
resentment, and reconciled me to a life which I once thought insupportable."</P>
<P>Here Madam d'Oresty ceased—and the Count, ris∣ing from his seat, looked with reverence toward Hea∣ven, and exclaimed, "<HI>Wonderful are thy works, Oh God, and thy ways past finding out.</HI>" Then taking Madam d'Oresty by the hand, <Q>What a train of interesting events, said he, have you unfolded! In me behold the father of your husband; in me, my children,</Q> turning to Ambrose and Eleanor, "behold your grandsire,"</P>
<P>The Colonel, his pupils, and indeed the compa∣ny in general, had been prepared by the aspect and gestures of the Count; to expect something extraordi∣nary; but Madam d'Oresty, absorbed in the recital of her calamities, and commanding only a side view of him from the seat she occupied, heard this declara∣tion with inexpressible wonder. She viewed the Count a moment in silent astonishment: but soon recollecting the character in which she stood before him, she covered her face with her hands, and bend∣ing forward, seemed to await the reproaches she considered due to her from the father of her hus∣band.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="035098_0184_1000A450843A5620"/>
The Count was affected by this interesting atti∣tude, too expressive to be misunderstood, and tak∣ing her hand, assured her he should henceforth consider her not only as the widow of his son, but as the daughter of his affection. "You appear, said he, "too sensible of your errors to permit me to animadvert upon them; we have none of us been blameless; myself not the least; the reserve and se∣verity with which, from his infancy I treated my son, repulsed rather than invited the confidence of friend∣ship, while the authority I assumed over his inclina∣tions made him lose the respect due to me as a pa∣rent; but his errors have been signally punished; let the grave cover them, and may they prove a use∣ful lesson to his children. Early my dear Ambrose, and you, my sweet Eleanor, learn to restrain your inclinations, and to keep them within the bounds of moderation; remember, my children, that the gra∣tification of a moment may be followed by years of anxiety and pain."</P>
<P>The Count then embraced Eleanor and Ambrose, who threw themselves upon their knees to implore his blessing. The conversation then turning upon past events, the Count confirmed what Madam d'Oresty had heard concerning the death of her husband. "I
<PB N="187" REF="035098_0185_1000B684993D5590"/>
unfortunately," said he, "set out for Bath the morn∣ing on which the fatal duel was fought; an express was dispatched for me, but before I arrived my son had breathed his last. I will not attempt to describe my grief; he was my only child, and Heaven is witness how dear! The country became hate∣ful to me: I solicited my recall, and returned to France. It happened soon after that I had letters from Cuba, acquainting me with the death of an old friend, who had left me his possessions there: I pre∣pared for the voyage, thinking an entire change of objects might dissipate the melancholy which since the death of my son had taken possession of my soul. I arrived, and remained there some months, when Blake, as the Colonel has before related, descended upon the island, and bore me, among the number assembled in his vessel, to St. Verrado." Here the Count ceased, and joined with every one present in admiring the wonderful chain of events by which Providence had united them.</P>
<P>The Count had passed about a week at the mansi∣on of his friend, when he began to think of embark∣ing for France, to see after his estates. The pros∣pect of so early a separation cast a gloom over the whole party; but when the Colonel proposed to his
<PB N="188" REF="035098_0186_1000B686265E5788"/>
Lady a trip to the continent, chearfulness was uni∣versaly restored. Charles and Ambrose, between whom a friendship founded upon mutual virtues had already taken place, looked at each other and smiled, while the eyes of Eleanor met those of her mother and Mrs. Carlton sparkling with pleasure; in short, the proposal was universally relished, and in less than a month they all embarked for France. The Count upon arriving found that his estates still re∣mained in the hands of his agent: for as no certain tidings of his death had transpired, no claim had been made. The Reader need not be told that the Co∣lonel and his family were the guests of the Count d'Oresty; during three months which their visit con∣tinued, he spared no polite and friendly attention to render it agreeable; they made an excursion to Pa∣ris, from which the Count's seat was a few leagues distant, and were gratified with the view of every thing that celebrated city contained deserving the at∣tention of the curious. They visited the Louvre, the Thuilleries, the Palace of Orleans, celebrated for its valuable collection of paintings, and the Gobe∣lines, a famous manufactory of tapestry, which takes its name from one Goblie, a noted dyer of Reims, who lived in the reign of Francis the First.
<PB N="189" REF="035098_0187_1000A4520829A538"/>
Ambrose and Eleanor were interested in every thing they saw; the perfection to which the arts had arisen struck them with wonder and delight; for though ac∣quainted with the principles of each, they had form∣ed no idea of the powerful effects produced by them when applied by genius and industry: in the mean while, they conciliated the affection of heir mother and grandfather by a thousand instances of their do∣cility and the goodness of their hearts; the Count became daily more attached to them, and they in return omitted nothing that might express their gra∣titude and affection. After three months spent in the pleasures of social intercourse, the Colonel prepared to return with his family to England, when an un∣expected event retarded his departure, and plunged every one in the deepest sorrow. This was the de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th of the Count d'Oresty, who was seized with a complaint of which he died in three days. His loss was sincerely regreted by every one but especially by Ambrose and Eleanor, who had flattered them∣selves with long enjoying his paternal care, and shew∣ing by their conduct the grateful sense they entertain∣ed of his kindness. Nor was Madam d'Oresty less affected: she regreted him with all the warmth of gratitude and friendship his generous conduct toward
<PB N="190" REF="035098_0188_1000B68947CFE4A8"/>
her and her children merited; indeed his attachment to them was manifested to the last act of his life; for being alarmed at the symptoms of his disorder, he sent for a notary and in the presence of the Colonel and Mrs. Carlton made his will, in which he nomi∣nated Ambrose his▪ heir, and provided amply for Eleanor and her mother: but this acquisition of in∣dependence, far from mitigating, encreased the grief they felt for the loss of their friend, by adding ano∣ther to the proofs they had already received of his friendship and affection.</P>
<P>As the Colonel was nominated executor to the Count's will, as also guardian to Eleanor and Am∣brose, his presence was necessary to arrange their affairs: he remained, therefore, some time longer in France, till having settled every thing to his sa∣tisfaction, he embarked for England, accompanied by Madam d'Oresty and his pupils, who joyfully accepted the invitation he gave of passing the en∣suing Winter in England▪ after a pleasant voyage they arrived; and in the society of their friends be∣gan to resume their wonted chearfulness, when an event the most distressing and unexpected turned all their joy to the bitterest anguish. The Reader must recollect that Sir▪ James Corpley had sent the pri∣soners
<PB N="191" REF="035098_0189_1000A4571E1B2F10"/>
taken at St. Verrado to the Governor of the Spanish island St. Domingo, with an account of the expedition, and his reasons for undertaking it: these reasons, however, did not satisfy the Court of Spain; the destruction of the Colony was con∣strued into an infringement upon the rights of the Spanish Crown, and remonstrances made to the British Cabinet. The inhabitants of St. Verrado were in vain represented as a banditti, to whose depredations all Europe was subject; the honour of the Spanish Court was thought to be concerned, and satisfaction demanded. In short, after various negotiations between the Courts, it was at last settled to punish the aggressors, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Sir James Corpley and the Colonel, with exile. This was an unexpected stroke: the joy which had for some months before enlivened the mansion of the Colo∣nel was no more. Eleanor wept; Ambrose in∣veighed loudly against the sentence, which, not∣withstanding the representations of the Colonel, he could not help thinking unjust, and both declared they would follow their protector to the end of the earth. Madam d'Oresty said the same to her friend Mrs. Carlton, who felt rather on her husbands, than her own account, observing that it was of lit∣tle importance what country she inhabited, if she
<PB N="192" REF="035098_0190_1000A468904A5960"/>
had the society of her husband, son, and friend. "Ah," said Eleanor, "would to Heaven we were all together in our isle!" This exclamation, utter∣ed without design, gave birth to an idea in the mind of the Colonel, which soon became the fa∣vourite topic of conversation: this was no other than the founding of a coloney in the island which had so long served him and his pupils as a retreat. He mentioned it to Sir James Corpley who imme∣diately entered into it, and pointed out the proba∣bility of Government approving and encouraging such a plan; in short, they united their interests, obtained the permission and encouragement they de∣sired, and began to arrange every thing for the founding of a new colony. Madam d'Oresty and her children still expressing their resolution of join∣ing their fate with that of their friends, the Colonel thought proper to set before them the advantages they would forego by quitting a civilized country, where every enjoyment affluence could purchase awaited them, for one unfrequented, in which they must wait some years, at least, even for the con∣veniences of life; he said all that the most generous and disinterested mind could dictate upon the sub∣ject, but Madam d'Oresty, to the inexpressible joy
<PB N="193" REF="035098_0191_1000B68ACD366E58"/>
of Ambrose and Eleanor, declared, that as it co∣incided with the inclinations of her children, her resolution was fixed, and that she had no higher ambition than to live and die with her friend.</P>
<P>In about six months all was ready for their de∣parture, and Sir James Corpley, the Colonel, Mrs. Carlton, Charles, Madam d'Oresty, her children, the worthy Mr. Millar, and honest Peter, embark∣ed at Portsmouth, with about six hundred persons, men and women, who willingly followed as sett∣lers in the new Government. The voyage was fa∣vourable; after a few weeks sail they drew near the Antillis, and Ambrose and Eleanor began to search with wishful eyes for the island which had been the asylum of their youth: at length, the ves∣sel directing its course eastward of Jamaica, they discerned from far the point of a rock which seem∣ed familiar to them: the vessel approches: it is the same; it is their beloved isle. They behold the melancholy vestiges of the forest destroyed by the conflagration; the shore where they had fabricated the little bark in which alone and unprotected they had tempted the dangers of the sea: they land, and feel a thousand pleasing sensations on finding them∣selves again in an island in which, though they had
<PB N="194" REF="035098_0192_1000A460C4191A50"/>
experienced some painful moments, they had pas∣sed years of peace and tranquility. Every spot is visited; the place where their cabin stood; the ca∣vern in which Derley expired; the grot where ho∣nest Peter was preserved; nor will it be asked if they visited the little mount covered with myrrh trees; they are already with their mother at the foot of the monument erected with their own hands to the memory of Derley, shedding with her the tear of gratitude and affection.</P>
<P>In a short time the ground is cleared, and broken up; buildings arise; fortifications, even a port issues from the hands of the new colonists, and in less than four years they had shelter, cultivated fields, in a word, all the conveniences of life. Sir James Corpley and the Colonel, who were nominated joint Governors, in conjunction formed a code of laws, which were tendered to, and universally approved by the people; they governed the Colony with that jus∣tice and moderation which formed the basis of their character; and the same of their wisdom, and of the happiness enjoyed under their administration soon reaching England, they had the pleasure of seeing the new Colony daily encrease, and at length become one of the most flourishing; it was called the <HI>Isle of
<PB N="195" REF="035098_0193_1000B68C510AEA40"/>
Twins,</HI> in memory of the desertion of the children, and the sign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d protection afforded them by Heaven. Not long after the arrival of the new Colonists, some Carribes, according to their usual custom, landed on the island; at the sight of the Europeans they em∣barked precipitately in their canoes, but the Colonel wishing to put some questions to them, ordered seve∣ral to be detained: the account they gave of their ex∣pedition into the island; once in three years, was nearly the same as that given by Peter: but they added, they often stayed several days in the island, during which they planted maize and other grain, in the hope of finding it multiplied at their next visit. This singular custom explained to the Colonel what he had till now considered as a mystery, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the finding, on his first arrival in the island, entire plains of maize and a variety of vegetable productions, which required the pains of culture, and consequent∣ly not to be expected in an uninhabited land: but to return. A few years after their arrival in the island, the Colonel and Mrs. Carlton had the satisfaction of seeing their son Charles united to Eleanor; and soon after Ambrose made choice of a young lady, the niece of Sir James Corpley, universally esteemed for her amiable disposition and personal accomplish∣ments. Honest Peter enjoyed the tranquility his
<PB N="196" REF="035098_0194_1000B68DDCEE7E80"/>
years required and his services merited; he died at an advanced age, a few years after their arrival in the island, and was buried at the side of Derley, to whose memory a superb monument was erected. The worthy Mr. Millar lived universally respected, and by his virtues did honour to the religion he pro∣fessed and maintained in the Colony. Madam d'Oresty and her friend Mrs. Carlton had the pleasure of seeing their friendship perpetuated in their children, who, by their conduct, d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ily rendered themselves more worthy their affection. In short, all these wor∣thy characters in this delightful retreat enjoyed the tranquility which is the result only of virtue.</P>
<P>Ambrose and Eleanor through life entertained for their preceptor that tender respect and gratitude his conduct toward them justly merited, and their hearts were so well formed to pay: they looked up to him as to the parent who had fostered and to the friend who had guided their youth, ever bearing in remem∣brance, that the happiness they enjoyed in society was the fruit of those precepts they had imbibed from him in solitude.</P>

<HEAD>Auguste and Madelaine. A REAL HISTORY.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By Miss HELEN MARIA WILLIAMS.</BYLINE>
<P>A FRIEND of mine who is lately gone to Toulouse, has sent me from thence an account of some circumstances which happened not long ago in that part of France, and which, she says, are still much the subject of conversation. I shall transcribe this narrative, which I believe will interest you. Perhaps a novel-writer, by the aid of a little additi∣onal misery, and by giving the circumstances which actually happened a heightened colour—by taking his pallet, and dashing with the full glow of red, what nature had only tinged with pale violet, might almost spin a volume from these materials. Yet, af∣ter all, nothing is so affecting as simplicity, and nothing so forcible as truth. I shall therefore send
<PB N="198" REF="035098_0196_1000B6921FBB1BA0"/>
you the story exactly as I received it; and in such parts of it as want interest, I beg you will recollect that you are not reading a tale of fiction: and that in real life, incidents are not always placed as they are in novels, so as to produce <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> effect. In some parts of the narrative you will meet with a little ro∣mance; but perhaps you will wonder that you meet with no more; since the scene is not in the cold phi∣losophic climate of England, but in the warm regi∣ons of the south of France, where the imagination is elevated, where the passions acquire extraordinary energy, and where the fire of poetry flashed from the harps of the Troubadours, amid the sullen gloom of the Gothic ages.</P>
<P>A young Frenchman, whose usual residence was at Paris, having travelled as far as Toulouse the year before the revolution, was invited by a party of his friends to accompany them to Bareges, where some of them were going in pursuit of amusement, and others in search of health from the medical springs which rise so plentifully, both in hot and cold streams, among the Pyrenean mountains.</P>
<P>This young Parisian, who had some taste for the sublime scenery of nature, felt that it would be lux∣ury to leave a little longer the regular walks which
<PB N="199" REF="035098_0197_1000A4654A426378"/>
art has planted in the Thuilleries, and the trim gar∣dens and <HI>jets-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eau</HI> she has formed at Versailles, to wander among those piles of mountains which over∣hang each other, and listen to the torrents which fall down them with loud and irresistible impetuosity.</P>

<L><HI>Like Anio, tumbling roars.</HI>"—</L>
</LG>
<P>What powerful sensations does the first view of such a scene produced—We seem to begin a new existence; every former impression is for a while <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ased from the memory, and the mind feels enwrap∣ped and lost in the strong emotions of awe astonish∣ment, and admiration.</P>
<P>Bareges was crouded, as it usually is in the sea∣son, not only with French company, but also with strangers, who travel from other countries, in order to use its celebrated baths. The company amused themselves, as they generally do at water-drinking places, by sauntering, lounging, cards, lotteries, jeux-d'esprit, and scandal.</P>
<P>Bareges is a very expensive place. Even mode∣rate accommodations must be purchased at a high
<PB N="200" REF="035098_0198_1000A484AB176AF8"/>
rate; and provisions, as well as lodgings, are some∣times obtained with difficulty. Bareges is therefore seldom resorted to by any but people of considerable fortune, who can afford to level the obstacles which mountains interpose to their conveniences and com∣forts, by the all subduing force of gold.</P>
<P>Among a number of persons of rank and fortune, there was however, one family at Bareges in a differ∣ent situation. This family consisted of an elderly in∣firm French officer, who had long been afflicted with the palsy, and his daughter, a young woman about nineteen years of age. Their appearance and mode of living seemed to indicate, that, though in search of relief this old officer had journed to Bareges, he had in so doing far exceeded the bounds of econo∣my which his circumstances prescribed, and was forced to deny himself every accommodation his in∣firmities could spare. He lived in the most retired manner, in the worst lodging at Bareges;—and while the other ladies were dressed in a style of ex∣pensive variety and profusion, his daughter wore on∣ly a plain linen gown, which though always per∣fectly clean, was coarse; and her dark hair was left unpowdered, and without any ornament whatever. Fortunately for Madelaine, however (for that was
<PB N="201" REF="035098_0199_1000A487EA6155B0"/>
her name) her person was calculated to make her coarse gown appear to the best advantage; and though she was not very beautiful, her countenance had an expression of sweetness which answered the end of beauty by exciting love and admiration.</P>
<P>The company at Bareges soon became acquainted with each other, and the ladies always took notice of Madelaine when they met her in their walks, which however, did not happen very often, for her father was frequently unable to go out. When he did he was supported on one side by Madelaine, and on the other by his servant. It was impossible to see with insensibility, the attention which this interest∣ing young woman paid her father, whom she never quitted one moment. It was remarked with what careful tenderness she used to lead him along the streets of Bareges, walking the slowest pace she could, and watching his steps as he moved feebly on. And when he was not able to venture out, she was seen at the window of their little parlour reading, in order to entertain him.—Her looks and manner announced that her disposition was naturally sprightly, and that she would have been gay, if her father had not been sick. But all the cheerfulness she could assume while he suffered, was exerted to amuse him, and shorten the tedious hours of languor and debility.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="035098_0200_1000A475AB28E3A0"/>
Though Madelaine was handsome, the obscurity and seclusion in which she lived preserved her from the envy of the women.—They knew well enough, that the gentlemen at Bareges were, for the most part, men of the world, who though they may ad∣mire beauty, and approve of virtue, are never so far the dupes of any tender or moral sentiment as to let it interfere either with their vanity, their ambition, or their interest. Although the French revolution had not yet happened, these ladies were aware that with respect to marriage, the age of <HI>calculators</HI> was already come, and therefore no rival was to be feared in Madelaine. The ladies joined with the men in admiting the grace of her person, and amia∣ble qualities which her conduct displayed. Made∣laine, in short, became the object of general esteem.</P>
<P>Auguste, for so I shall call our young Parisian, who has lost his title since the laws of equality have been established in his country—Auguste spoke less of Madelaine than the other gentlemen at Bareges; but it was perhaps because he thought of her more. Sometimes in his solitary morning rambles he used to make comparisons between her and the Parisian ladies, among whom he had passed the winter, and the comparison generally ended with a deep
<PB N="203" REF="035098_0201_1000A48B5DAD0FA8"/>
sigh. The scene on these meditations was certainly much in Madelaine's favour. Perhaps at Paris or Varsailles, Auguste might have been dazzled by the polished graces of a fine lady rouged, powder∣ed, perfumed and equipped for conquest. These artificial attractions might, perhaps, have accorded well enough with clipped trees and angular walks. But Madelaine's simple manners, Madelaine's na∣tural smiles, and unstudied blushes, were far more in unison with the Pyrennean mountains.</P>
<P>One evening when Auguste was walking in the town of Bareges with some ladies, he saw Made∣laine at a little distance assisting, with great difficul∣ty, to support her father, who appeared to be seized with a fit. Auguste darted like an arrow toward the spot, and held up the officer till he found himself somewhat recovered; and then Au∣guste, with a sort of gentle violence, obliged Made∣laine, who was pale and trembling, to let go her father's arm, and suffer him to assist the ser∣vant in leading him home, which was but a few steps farther. Auguste entered the house, where he remained till the old officer was a little revi∣ved;—and, after prevailing upon Madelaine to take a few hartshorn drops, he retired.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="035098_0202_1000A547A28065C0"/>
The next morning he felt that common civility required he should pay the old officer a visit and learn how he had passed the night. It happened that Madelaine had the very same idea. "Surely," thought she, "it will be very strange if this young man, who was so kind, so careful of my father, and who made me take some hartshorn drops, should neglect to call and enquire after us." This idea had come acros<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> her mind several times; and she was meditating upon it at her father's bedside, when Auguste was announced.</P>
<P>The old officer, who had all the finished polite∣ness of his country and his profession, received him in the most courteous manner; and though he spoke with some difficulty, yet he was profuse in acknowledgments for the service Auguste had ren∣dered him. Madelaine's thanks were few, and simply expressed; but the tone in which they were uttered was such that Auguste felt he could have sa∣crificed his life to have deserved them.</P>
<P>The old officer still continued sick, and therefore Auguste still considered it as an indispensable mark of attention to go every day, and learn the state of his health.—He also began to feel that these visits became every day more necessary to
<PB N="205" REF="035098_0203_1000A47E852F6868"/>
his own happiness. That happiness was indeed embittered by many painful reflections. He well knew that to obtain his father the count de—'s consent to marry Madelaine, was as impossible as it was for himself to conquer the passion she had inspired. He knew exactly the order in which his father's enquiries would run on this subject. He was aware that there were two interrogatories to be answered. The first was—"How many thou∣sand li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>res has she a year?" And the second—"Is she noble?" And nothing could be more embar∣rassing than that the enquiry concerning fortune, would, he was sure, come first; since that was the only article which could not be answered in a sa∣tisfactory manner; for to Madelaine's family no objection could have been made. By the way, though the former nobility of France would not ab∣solutely contaminate the pure streams of noble blood by an union with the daughter of a <HI>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>turier,</HI> they had always sufficient generosity to abate some ge∣nerations of nobility in favour of a proper equiva∣lent in wealth.</P>
<P>Auguste, while he was convinced of the impos∣sibility of obtaining his father's consent to his mar∣riage, did not pay Madelaine one visit the less
<PB N="206" REF="035098_0204_1000B693A5CE3130"/>
from that consideration; and when the usual hour of his visit arrived, he often suddenly broke a chain of admirable reason on the imprudence of his attach∣ment, in order to hasten to the dwelling of her he loved. In a short time he ceased all kind of reason∣ing on the subject, and abandoned his heart without reserve to the most violent and unconquerable pas∣sion.</P>
<P>Auguste made a declaration to the old officer of the sentiments which his daughter had inspired. The old gentleman mentioned it to Madelaine, and she only answered by tears, of which he perfectly under∣stood the meaning. When Auguste explained his situation with respect to his father, the officer de∣sired him to think of his daughter no more. Au∣guste felt that he might as well have desired him to cease to breathe. He continued his visits, and the officer was soon reduced to that state of langour and debility which left him neither the power nor the wish to forbid them. His complaints increased every day, and were attended with many alarming symptoms. The season for the water of Bareges was now past, and all the company left the place except the old officer, who was too weak to be re∣moved, and Auguste, who, while Madelaine re∣mained,
<PB N="207" REF="035098_0205_1000B6952EC0D388"/>
had no power to tear himself from the spot. In a few weeks the old officer felt that his dying hour was near. Auguste knelt with Made∣laine at his bedside—her voice was suffocated by tears: and Auguste had scarcely power to articu∣late in broken accents that he would devote his life to the happiness of Madelaine. The old officer fixed his eyes with a look of tender anxiety upon his daughter, and soon after expired. Madelaine mourn∣ed for her father with uncontrouled affliction, nor could all the attentions of her lover dispel that an∣guish with which her affectionate heart lamented the loss of her parent.</P>
<P>The winter being far advanced, she proposed to defer her journey to the distant province where she and her father had lived, until spring, and to place herself in the mean time in a convent not far from Bareges. Auguste exerted all the eloquence of love to induce her to consent immediately to a private marriage. She hesitated at this proposal; and while they were conversing together on the sub∣ject, the door of the room in which they were sit∣ting was suddenly thrown open, and Auguste saw his father the count de—enter. He had heard of the attachment which detained his son at Bare∣ges,
<PB N="208" REF="035098_0206_1000B69799CF0E40"/>
and had hastened to tear him from the spot before it was too late. He upbraided his son with great bitterness, and began also to upbraid Made∣laine: but there was something in her looks, her silence, and her tears, which stifled the terms of haughty reproach in which he was prepared to ad∣dress her; and ordering his son to leave the room, he desired to speak to her alone. After explaining to her the absolute impossibility of her being ever united to his son, and his determination to disinher∣it him, and leave his whole fortune to his second son, if Auguste should persist in his attachment to her—after endeavouring to awaken her pride and her generosity, he desired to know where she pro∣posed going. She told him her intention of plac∣ing herself immediately in the convent of—. He approved of this design, and left her to go to his son. No sooner was the door of the room shut, than Madelaine gave way to those tears which she had scarcely been able to refrain while the count was speaking. She had never felt so sensibly her orphan condition as at this moment; and the dear remembrance of her fond father was mingled with the agony of disappointed love.</P>
<P>Meantime the count de—declared to his son,
<PB N="209" REF="035098_0207_1000B69A1B552588"/>
that his only chance of ever obtaining his mistress, depended on his absolute un-conditional submission to his commands, and that he must instantly attend him to Paris. Auguste eagerly enquired what was to become of Madelaine, and his father told him that she had determined to take refuge in the con∣vent of—. Auguste absolutely refused to depart till he was allowed an interview with Madelaine. The count was obliged to consent; but before he suffered them to meet, he obtained a promise from Madelaine not to mention to her lover any particu∣lars of the conversation which had passed between her and the count.</P>
<P>Auguste, in this last interview with Madelaine, atoned for the cruel disdain of his father, by the most solemn and passionate assurances of fidelity, not to be shaken by time or circumstance; and then, after attempting to leave the room several times, and re∣turning as often, he at length tore himself away. Madelaine when she saw him depart, felt that every earthly hope had vanished with him.</P>
<P>She set out early the next morning for the con∣vent of—; but not till after she had sat for some time weeping in the chair which Auguste used to
<PB N="210" REF="035098_0208_1000B69B9F0D5F10"/>
occupy. Madelaine passed the remaining part of the winter in the convent of—, during which pe∣riod she received frequent letters from Auguste; and when spring arrived, he conjured her, instead of removing to her own province, to remain a little longer in her present situation; and flattered her with hopes of being able, ere long, to fulfil those engagements upon which all his happiness depended.</P>
<P>In the summer of this year an event took place which will render that summer forever memorable. The French nation, too enlightened to bear any lon∣ger those monstrous oppressions which ignorance of its just rights alone had tolerated; shook off its fet∣ters, and the revolution was accomplished.</P>
<P>Madelaine was a firm friend to the revolution, which she was told had made every Frenchman free, "And if every Frenchman is free," tho't Madelaine, surely every Frenchman may marry the woman he loves." It appeared to Madelaine, that, putting all political con∣siderations, points upon which she had not much medi∣tated, out of the question, obtaining liberty of choice in marriage was alone well worth the trouble of a revolution; and she was as warm a patriot from this single idea, as if she had studied the de∣claration of rights made by the constituent assem∣bly, in all its extent and consequences.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="035098_0209_1000A47143F42178"/>
The count de—, who was informed of the correspondence between the two lovers, and who saw little hopes of his son's subduing a passion which this intercourse of letters served to cherish, contriv∣ed means to have Auguste's letters intercepted at the convent. In vain Madelaine enquired with all the anxiety of tenderness for letters. In vain she count∣ed the hours till the return of the post days. Post after post arrived, and brought no tidings of Au∣guste. Three months passed in the cruel torments of anxiety and suspense, and were at length suc∣ceeded by despair. Madelaine believed she was for∣gotten—forgotten by Auguste! She consulted her own heart, and it seemed to her impossible; yet, after a silence of three months, she could doubt no longer.</P>
<P>Poor Madelaine now recollected with anguish, instead of pleasure, that all Frenchmen were free. She would have found some sad consolation in be∣lieving that all Frenchmen were slaves. It would have been some alleviation of her sorrows if Au∣guste had been forced to abandon her; and she fan∣cied she could have borne to lose him, if she had been sure that he still loved her—it was losing him by his own fault that filled her heart with pangs almost insupportable.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="035098_0210_1000B69D47A01E30"/>
The little pittance which Madelaine, after paying her father's debts, had left for her own support, was insufficient to defray her expences as a boarder in the convent. She had already by her sweetness and gen∣tleness, gained the affections of some of the nuns, to whom she was also attached, and who incessantly conjured her to take the veil. "And why," she sometimes exclaimed, "why should I hesitate any longer in so doing? Since Auguste is lost, what have I to regret in renouncing the world? What sacrifice do I make; what happiness do I resign?</P>
<P>Madelaine had no ties to the world, of which she knew but little: but to separate herself irrecovera∣bly, and for ever, from him to whom her soul was devoted—to see him, to hear his voice no more—to take vows which would make it even a crime to think of him—to banish him even from her thoughts—alas! Madelaine felt like Eloisa.
<Q><L>"All is not heaven's while Abelard has part,</L>
<L>"Still rebel nature holds out half my heart!"</L></Q>
Sometimes too the idea occurred that Auguste might love her still—"And am I then," thought Made∣laine, "going to reduce myself to a state in which I shall be forced to wish he was unfaithful, in order to save me from the agonies of remorse!"—She
<PB N="213" REF="035098_0211_1000B6A0042854C0"/>
put off all thoughts of entering on her novitiate for some weeks longer—no letters arrived, and again her resolution to take the veil returned. "Why," cried she, "why should I still continue to lament that inconstant lover who thinks of me no more? Alas, did he not see the anguish of my soul at part∣ing with him?—Does he not know the deserted situ∣ation in which I am left?—Oh, yes! he knows I have no other refuge, no other resource than taking the veil—no doubt he wishes to hear I have done so—he will find in my renunciation of the world some excuse for his infidelity—Oh, heavens! will Auguste hear then that I am separated from him for ever without one sigh?—Ah, why need I deli∣berate any longer?—My trials will soon be past—I feel that my heart will break—yes, death will come to my relief—and in heaven I shall find my father!"</P>
<P>Madelaine at length determined to join the holy sisterhood of the convent. The white veil for her novitiate was prepared. The day was fixed, when, prostrate with her face toward the earth, and with flow∣ers scattered over her, and a part of her long tresses cut off, she was to enter upon that solemn tribunal preparatory to her eternal renunciation of the world—of Auguste!</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="035098_0212_1000B6A1894FD9A0"/>
A few days before that which was appointed for the ceremony, Madelaine was called to the parlour, where she found her lover, with some of the munici∣pal officers of the town, wearing their national scar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</P>
<P>Madelaine, at the sight of Auguste, with difficulty reached a chair, in which she sellback senseless; while Auguste could not forbear uttering some imprecati∣ons against the iron grate by which they were sepa∣rated, and which prevented him from flying to her assistance. He, however, procured help, and Ma∣delaine recovered.</P>
<P>One of the municipal officers then informed her, that they had received the day before a decree of the national assembly, forbidding any nuns to be professed. He added, that the municipality had already given information of this new law to the abbess, who had consented to allow Madelaine to leave the convent immediately. As he pronounced these last words, Madelaine looked at her lover.—Auguste hastened to explain to her that his uncle, who loved him, and pitied his sufferings, had at length, made a will, leaving him his fortune upon condition that his father consented to his marriage with Madelaine.</P>
<P>When her lover and the municipal officers departed, Madelaine retired to her apartment, to give way to
<PB N="215" REF="035098_0213_1000A48632708578"/>
those delicious tears which were poured from a heart overflowing with wonder, thankfulness, and joy. When her first emotions had subsided, she began to pack up her little wardrobe in preparation for leaving the convent on the following day. "I always loved the revolution," thought Madelaine, as she laid a∣side the white gown in which she was to be mar∣ried the next morning; "and this last decree is surely of all others the best and wisest—but if it had come too late!"—At this idea Madelaine took up the veil for her novitiate, which lay upon her table, and bathed it with a flood of tears.</P>
<P>The next morning, Auguste and Madelaine were married in the parish church of—, and immedi∣ately after the ceremony, set out for Paris, where they now live, and are, I am told two of the hap∣piest people, and the best patriots in France.</P>
