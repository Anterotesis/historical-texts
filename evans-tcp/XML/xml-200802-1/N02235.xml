</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SOLOMON the Wise (as the Learn∣ed well observe) in the former part of our Context, is instructing Sub∣jects with their Duty toward Rulers, Which Duty he urges upon them with many excellent Motives and Arguments to enforce their Loyalty &amp; Obe∣dience; and left Rulers from what he had said concerning the Obedience of the Sub∣ject, shou'd take occasion to abuse their Power, lest they shou'd think themselves Priviledged ones to do as they list, &amp; become Arbitrary &amp; Despotick: He therefore brings in a Ca∣veat, and inserts an Admonition and puts them in mind that as Subjects may not Re∣bel against lawful Authority (and indeed
<PB N="2" REF="002662_0005_0FE5F974A5B1F2B8"/>
there is no other Authority but such; there's great difference between <HI>Potentia &amp; Potestas, Dunam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s &amp; Exousia</HI>) so neither may Rulers bec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me Licentious, Unjust, and Tyrannize over the Subject: Which Caution and Ad∣monition is included in a declaration of that Dependence which is mutual between Sub∣jects and Rulers, in regard of the good or ill State of the Common Wealth. Rulers can't be either good or bad to themselves, but the Subjects must share in either Felicity or Mise∣ry, under them in their Administrations.</P>
<P>1. The Miseries of a People is briefly hinted in ver. 16. <HI>Wo to thee, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Land</HI> Wo is the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e denounced in general terms; for who, alas, can give a detail of the Mischiefs that attend a bad Government? Ill Government arising from ill Governours and Rulers, Supreme and Subordinate.</P>
<P N="1">(1) <HI>Supreme;</HI> in that Clause, <HI>When thy King is a Child;</HI> Not so much in Years &amp; Age, as Vertue, Wisdom and Understanding, Good∣ness and Ability.</P>
<P N="2">(2) <HI>Subordinate Rulers,</HI> called <HI>Princes;</HI> a Se∣cond degree, including all lower &amp; inferior Ranks and Orders: whose fault as a ground of the Subjects Misery is mentioned, where one or two instances implies many: Intem∣perance, a careless Negligence &amp; Slothfulness, <HI>ver.</HI> 16. Spending their time in Feasting &amp; Ca∣rowzing;

indulging the Flesh when they should be Sitting in the Gates and upon the Service of the Subject, or preparing therefor, or in other necessary Business</P>
<P>2. We have intimation of the Happiness of a People under the Regimen &amp; Govern∣ment of good Rulers. <HI>Blessed art thou, O Land, &amp;c.</HI> And here the goodness of such Rulers is mentioned; and one particular is <HI>Synecdochally</HI> put for many, as <HI>Pemble</HI> observes.</P>
<P N="1">(1) When the Supreme Ruler the King, Rules well; <HI>is the Son of Nobles:</HI> The mean∣ing an't of Nobility of Birth and Extract, or Nobility in Blood mainly and principally, at least, 1 <HI>King.</HI> 3. 7. But 'tis meant of Policy, Piety and Prudence</P>
<P N="2">(2) As to Inferior Rulers, their goodness is set forth by their Prudence, Temperance, Care and Caution; who are men governed in all their Actions, Conversations and Ad∣ministrations, by good &amp; right Ends. That's the scope &amp; meaning of that Phrase, of <HI>their Eating in due season, for strength and not for drunkenness; i. e.</HI> to fit and prepare them for the discharge of their Duty: Which makes way for this Doctrine or Proposition.</P>
<P>DOCT. <HI>Good Rulers in a Common-Wealth, will be a great Blessing to a People.</HI></P>

<ITEM>2. <HI>The Reasons and Evidences of the Truth.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>The Use and Improvement.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>As for the Character, Properties and Qualifications of such a Ruler,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>A good Ruler must be a good man.</HI> Such is the Connexion between Piety &amp; Christian Policy, that a man must be a GOOD man, in order to his being a Good Ruler; a Con∣sciencious man, one that fears God, that walks with the fear of God before his Eyes. This is agreeable to what we have in God's Word; Exod. 18. 21. <HI>Thou shalt provide such as fear God, and place such to be Rulers.</HI> So <HI>Deut.</HI> 17. 14, 15. particularly <HI>ver.</HI> 19. which tho' spoken with express reference to Su∣preme Rulers, yet not exclusive of Inferior and Subordinate Officers. We read 2 Sam. 23. 3▪ <HI>He that ruleth over men must be Just, Ruling in the fear of God,</HI> Civil Rulers are to
<PB N="5" REF="002662_0008_0FE5F992048E1B70"/>
be <HI>Custodes Ʋ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ue Tabulae,</HI> Keepers of both Tables of the Law. Rulers in a Christian-Common-wealth have a <HI>Sacred Dep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>situm</HI> put into their hands. And as we have all reason in the world to fear, that men whose Biass is not Grace, will do no great Service for God &amp; Religion, so likewise that they will do a great deal of Mischief. If great men be good men, their goodness makes their greatness Honourable▪ but if they are bad men, their greatness makes their badness but the more Shameful &amp; Dangerous. And Famous <HI>Bolton</HI> writing to a great man, tells him out of <HI>Na∣zianzen That never any man void of the true fear of God, can possibly be cordially and conscionably Serviceable to men on Earth;</HI> and much more to the same purpose says that Man. Such men are acted by Self-love, and governed by Self-interest at best: Seek to serve themselves, and oft want nothing but an Opportunity &amp; Temptation to throw off the Mask; as is too often seen in Magistrates &amp; Ministers of the Gospel too. Such men are unfit &amp; unworthy to Rule over the Lord's People, who are unwilling to be Ruled by God himself. We read, <HI>Psal.</HI> 82.6. Civil Rulers are styled <HI>Gods.</HI> They are so by Deputation; they are GOD's Representatives, Cloathed with his Image, Adorned with Majesty &amp; Power by him▪ and shine with his Rays: But he who is not
<PB N="6" REF="002662_0009_0FE5F9875B617DB0"/>
partaker of the Divine Nature and vested with the Moral Beatifying Communicable Attributes of God, an't fit to bear the Scep∣ter of Rule &amp; Government over a Christian Common-wealth. Shall it be said by <HI>Zeno∣phon,</HI> That such was the Court of <HI>Cirus, That if a man blindfold should seek he could not miss of a good man?</HI> And shall a Christian People think Moral goodness no necessary Qualifica∣tion for Rulers? The Father of <HI>Constantine the Great,</HI> is said to have turned off some of his Courtiers and Councillors, saying, <HI>He can't be faithful to me, who is unfaithful to God. Pietate sublata tellitur Fides.</HI> I have oft with wonderment thought of <HI>Frederick</HI> a <HI>Gothick</HI> King and an <HI>Arian,</HI> who having a Servant that was near and dear to him, and of the Orthodox Faith; but turned <HI>Arian,</HI> hoping thereby to please his Master and recommend himself to his more peculiar Favour; the King his Master coming to understand it, most severely Punished him; commanding suddenly, <HI>Capite multari,</HI> giving this for his Reason (as he abovesaid) <HI>Qui non,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>He that won't be faithful to his God, I can't ex∣pect will be so to me.</HI> And to talk of mens being good Common-wealths men and fit to bear Rule over Religious People, and yet they not be men of Religion, is to talk at <HI>Random,</HI> without Reason or Religion. He
<PB N="7" REF="002662_0010_0FE5F99F941DD760"/>
that is not a good man or but only so, can never be a good Ruler, says <HI>Fuller.</HI> But this an't the only necessary Qualification.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Knowledge &amp; good Understanding is another Qualification that fits men for Rule.</HI> And in∣deed without this, men will be but Cyphers. They who Rule should be Knowing men in the nature and end of Government, and the Laws which ought to be the measure and boundaries of their Rule and Government. An Ignorant man may chance to do Justice, but much as the Blind man hits the mark: There is great hazard that either he prove rash &amp; precipitant and go beyond the Line, or else thro' fear or cowardize he fall mise∣rably short; and so the best of Causes may be miserably betrayed 'Tis especially dan∣gerous when Un-skilful men sit Judges in heavy &amp; weighty Cases. Many times thro' the cunning Craft and Subtlety of learned &amp; studied Lawyers, Judgment fails and falls in the Gate, and poor People ly under the weight of Oppression and Injustice; and all under the pretence &amp; colour of Law (wou'd to God it be never the miserable state of this Land) I shan't pretend to tell you the <HI>mini∣mum quod sic,</HI> of Knowledge necessary; but 'tis certain that the lower degrees will not make men <HI>Strong Rods to Rule.</HI> There will
<PB N="8" REF="002662_0011_0FE5F9A3A7383110"/>
be Seasons which call for good Hearts and the best Heads; and a strong head &amp; good heart together, make a good Ruler: And this <HI>head p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ece</HI> seems to be what God expects. See <HI>Exod.</HI> 18 21, 25 <HI>Able men.</HI> Ver. 20. <HI>Men of Study,</HI> men Taught &amp; Learned. In <HI>Deut.</HI> 1. 12 'tis said, <HI>Take wise &amp; understanding men.</HI> And without this, however honest &amp; well-meaning, 'tan't at all probable they'll do much to promote the welfare of a People.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Prudence &amp; Discretion is another necessary Qualification.</HI> Good Rulers will be discreet in their Administrations and Government. Wisdom will guide their Tongues Heads &amp; Hands too. Men who in the Executions of their Powers, will distinguish between Cause and Cause, Men and Men, Times &amp; Seasons. Such we read of, in that 1 <HI>Chron</HI> 12.32▪ <HI>Men that had understanding of the times, &amp; know what they and Israel ought to do.</HI> Those, 'tis said, <HI>mere the Heads &amp; Rulers of the People.</HI> Pru∣dent men who consult the State &amp; Condition of the People. What Laws to make what Penalties to affix, what Severity to use, when to brandish the Sword of Justice, and when to sheath it in the bowels of Offenders; they distinguish between such Thick S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll'd Trans∣gressors, whose hardiness make it necessary to brighten and sharpen the Sword, and to
<PB N="9" REF="002662_0012_0FE5F99060202AB8"/>
smite with redoubled force, and such upon whom a Frown will make due impression. They know how to distinguish between the Letter &amp; the Meaning of the Law <HI>Mens, ratio</HI> or <HI>finis Legis est Lex, not Litera.</HI> Rulers ought to suffer their Zeal to rise and to assert the Dignity of their Post; but this Zeal is to rise or fall as occasion serves: They are <HI>Dis∣creet</HI> men, <HI>Gen.</HI> 41. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Such guide their <HI>Affairs with discretion.</HI> David one of the best of Rulers was such, <HI>Psal.</HI> 101. So 112 5. They'll be men not heady and giddy, self-confident and conceited, but men willing to take the best Advice and Counsel in matters of Weight and Consequence: <HI>Prov.</HI> 1. 7. 'Tis a part of Folly <HI>to despise Counsel &amp; Instruction.</HI> A Prudent Ruler will endeavour to intermix Judgment with Mercy. 'Tis observed, in <HI>Prov</HI> 16. 12. 'Tis said, <HI>that the throne is E∣stablished by Righteousness.</HI> Yet Chap. 20. 28. 'Tis said <HI>that Mercy and Truth preserve the King, and that his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is Upholden by Mercy.</HI> He that is a Mortal God, should remember when he sits upon the Seat of Judgment, that he Represents that GOD who in Judg∣ment remembers Mercy. I remember I have read of a King, sitting out upon rule &amp; Government, asked a Counseller how he should do to best manage the Affairs of his Government? He took a piece of Paper and
<PB N="10" REF="002662_0013_0FE5F99EC14C65C0"/>
wrote on the top middle and bottom, <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de-ratio;</HI> Prudence and Wisdom carries Rulers between the Two Extremes, Indulgence and Severity, which is the best, if not the only way to Rule quietly, safely and succes∣sively. The old rule is, <HI>Legis Extremitas est Severitas.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Courage and Resolution is another Article.</HI> Good Rulers must be bold and resolute men, whose Front is well-steeled. Such who fear not the face of Man in a good Cause: Such men having forementioned Qualifica∣tions, will be Strong Rods indeed. <HI>Judg∣ment and Justice shall run down like Waters, &amp; Righteousness as mighty Streams.</HI> They'll break in upon the lines of strong and heady Op∣posers, and will not be beat out of Counte∣nance, or removed from the Seat of Justice by Vice however rampant. They fear not to sit in the Gate, tho' confronted by bold and daring Sinners: Nor can they be baffled and run down by bare-faced Impudence. Their Iron Sinew must either bend or break. <HI>Joshua</HI> was once and again bid to approve himself such an one; to be Bold and of good Courage and not Fear See <HI>Josh.</HI> 1. 6, 9, 18. Men of a cowardly truckling &amp; mean Spirit, will do but little Service; but will oft be out-faced in the Execution of Justice, Clear
<PB N="11" REF="002662_0014_0FE5F992D3A2A450"/>
Heads and stout Hearts, says <HI>Henry,</HI> make good Rulers and Judges.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Another Qualification is an Anti-worldly Spirit.</HI> They should be such by rights: Men that hate Covetousness. <HI>Gen.</HI> 18. 21. Men of a Generous and Noble Contempt of Worldly Wealth: Not only such who seek not Bribes, but such who Abhor even the very thoughts of it. That man an't fit to Rule, who don't despise the gain of Op∣pression and shake his hands from holding Bribes, <HI>Isa.</HI> 33. 15. God complained of such of old, who <HI>Judged for a Reward, Mic.</HI> 3. 11. <HI>Chap.</HI> 7.3. The Reward which a Jealous God will give such is very sad. 'Tis verily a sad time, when a poor injured People can't have Justice done them, without an extravagant Feeing &amp; Bribing the more principal Judges, Lawyers and Attorneys. Shall such Repre∣sent that GOD who tells us, <HI>He Judges not for a Reward Deut.</HI> 10. 17. It brings to mind a bold, yet deserved stroke of <HI>Catulus,</HI> meet∣ing the <HI>Roman Judges</HI> returning home, after they had Acquitted <HI>Clodius</HI> a great Male∣factor; <HI>You,</HI> said he, <HI>do well to be well Guarded for the Safety and Security of the Money you took for Bribes.</HI> A good Ruler will not only hate such Practises in himself, but will be careful to have no hand in Advancing others
<PB N="12" REF="002662_0015_0FE5F99B442F3E48"/>
of such rottenness to Places of Honour &amp; Dignity. They look on such Gain, but as a Cankering Rust; and esteem a <HI>Little</HI> well-gotten, better than <HI>Treasures</HI> gotten by Ini∣quity and Oppression. They are such who admire the Life of Famous Judge <HI>Hale.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>A Publick Spirit is an Excellent Qualifica∣tion in a Candidate for Rule:</HI> Such I mean, who have the Publick Interest lying near to their heart; that bear the Burden of it about with them from Day to Day. Such men the Interest of the People, is the greatest thing in the world with them. We read, when <HI>Samuel</HI> made a Feast for <HI>Saul,</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 9.24. The portion he sent him, <HI>was the Shoul∣der:</HI> If there's in it any Allegorical sense, as some acute Schoolmen imagine, it may in∣timate the Weight of Government; and that a People's Interest should ly near to a Ruler's Heart; and the need that Rulers have of strong Shoulders, a Generous Noble Spirit. A Narrow▪ Contracted, Selfish Spirit, is un∣becoming men in Publick Capacity.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>If a good measure of Activity and Zeal may be but added, we shall have a Ruler of Con∣summate Excellency indeed.</HI> And verily with∣out this, he'll be but too heavy moulded to move regularly in this Orb and Sphere.
<PB N="13" REF="002662_0016_0FE5F99DEEB93650"/>
Civil Rulers should be made of the best Me∣tal: Not Tin nor Lead, the one is too Flex-able, the other too Fragil▪ Rulers should be men of Sense and Feeling; that can be red hot when there is occasion for it, as the word signifies, <HI>Rom.</HI> 12. 11. <HI>Fervent.</HI> 'Tis true, Men that will appear in a declining day with a distinguishing Zeal for Justice and Piety, shall be stigmatized &amp; reproached, as hot Headed and Rash men: but this should not abate their Zeal, but rather increase it. They should be Cloathed with Zeal, as the Phrase is, <HI>Isa</HI> 59▪17 <HI>Phineas</HI> was Commended for his Zeal, and highly Rewarded too, <HI>Numb.</HI> 25. 11, 13 Natural Temper may be a great help to a man, but when Nature and Grace concur, a man may do great things I for∣bear adding, and proceed to the <HI>Reasons.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The First Reason and Evidence, <HI>Such Rulers are like to answer, in some good measure, the Ends of Civil Rule &amp; Government.</HI> A good Ruler, says <HI>Fuller,</HI> is one that looks on <HI>Salus Populi,</HI> to be <HI>Maxima Charta</HI> He owns what <HI>Cicero</HI> said, that <HI>Salus Populi est Finis imperii;</HI> The great subordinate End is the Publick good; the Means and Laws of Government must be calculated to work and bring about that End &amp; Effect. And a good Ruler knows these Maxims are not only founded in Na∣ture,
<PB N="14" REF="002662_0017_0FE5F02750037CC0"/>
but expresly asserted in God's Word: <HI>Rom.</HI> 13.4. <HI>He is the minister of God for good.</HI> A Peoples good is the End. A good Ru∣ler will study the Interest of the Common-wealth, and will not suffer any Private Views to come in Competition therewith: All shall be Sacrificed to subserve the Publick. He's one that has a Compassionate Regard for those of his Charge. Hence they are com∣pared to Fathers and Nursing Mothers, <HI>Isa.</HI> 49. 23. In the Book of Judges we find when <HI>Barak</HI> was ordered by <HI>Deborah the Prophetess,</HI> to Levy Forces and Oppose <HI>Siserah, Barak</HI> refuses <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nless she will go with him, tho' he knew her Presence wou'd bear away the Trophies of Honour and Eclipse his Glory, when he should be crown'd with Success, One makes this Observation upon it, that <HI>Barak</HI> was one that valued more the Success of the Enterprize, than his own Honour; having more at <HI>Heart</HI> the <HI>Publick Good</HI> than his own Honour. And 'tis observed, That a <HI>Saul</HI> before the Spirit of God departed from him, will be in distress for his People, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 11. 5. <HI>Henry'</HI>s Note upon it is, <HI>That good Ru∣lers will be in Pain, when their Subjects are in Tears.</HI> There will be a readiness in such Rulers to do even the best and all they can for the Subject. 'Tis an <HI>Ahasuerus</HI> and an <HI>Haman,</HI> that can sit down to Eat and Drink
<PB N="15" REF="002662_0018_0FE5F025174DDDB8"/>
when the City <HI>Shushan</HI> is Perplexed. A good Ruler can't look on himself Happy, unless the Subject be so too. Good Rulers consider well that their Peace, Prosperity &amp; Success, much depends on their interest in the hearts of the People: Therefore they will endeavour to suit and please the People what they may and can A Condescending Spirit is no un∣becoming Qualification in a Ruler. 'Tis taken Notice of by the Historian, to the honour of <HI>Trajon</HI> the Emperor, That once when mounted for Battle, he dismounted his Horse to hear the Complaint of a Poor Woman, that Cryed to him for Justice. 'Tis Chroni∣cled of our <HI>Edward</HI> the VI<HI>th.</HI> That he would appoint certain Hours to set with the Master of Requests, to see a Dispatch given to the Causes of the Poor. They that can pass by the repeated Cries and Complaints of the Subject and not take Notice thereof, han't the good Nature of the Unjust Judge. Good Rulers in their Exalted Station, think it not too low a stoop to do Service for God and their Country. 'Tis no ways inferior for a Governour to step into Inferior Courts, or into the Place of a Justice of Peace, to take care that Justice be done, and the Laws Exe∣cuted, when Necessity calls therefor. Dig∣nity of Place Excuses not from Extensive∣ness of Service. Excellent Mr. <HI>Henry</HI> Ob∣serves,
<PB N="16" REF="002662_0019_0FE5F994D6410968"/>
<HI>That when the Holy Ghost is about to give an Instance of</HI> Solomon'<HI>s Wisdom, a Proof is not fetch'd from the Mysteries of State, or the Poli∣cies of the Council-Board; but from the Trial &amp; Determination of a Cause between Party &amp; Party.</HI> And observes, <HI>That tho' Princes devolve such Business upon their Judges, yet they ought not to think it a matter below Themselves to take Cogni∣zance of</HI> Solomon <HI>the King patiently hears what the Parties had to say, the Case Opened, not by Lawyers,</HI> says he, <HI>but the Parties themselves, and then gives Judgment</HI> He did not divolve the Cause upon Inferior Officers; He him∣self will see Justice done, tho' a great King.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Such Rulers will have the Presence of God with them</HI> As good Rulers will be in a good measure Faithful to their Trust, so God will be with them to Guide, Prosper and Succeed them; and may if they will, many times, do a great deal of Service.

<HI>him whither soever he went▪</HI> 1 <HI>King.</HI> 2. 1, 23. Altho' Civil Rulers may sink far below what they could wish or desire, yet their La∣bours shall be Rewarded, and oftentimes with good Success. Tis observable at how low an Ebb Religion, good Order run of old in he Days of Bad Kings, and how they revived in the Reign of Good Kings.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The very Examples of such Rulers will do much good, many times, among a People.</HI> Ex∣amples are very taking: They are oft more Influential than Precepts. The Heathen <HI>Seneca</HI> was wont to say, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>us Exemplis quam P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aeceptis Vivimus.</HI> But 'tis especially true of the Examples of great Men, <HI>Magnates mag∣netes.</HI> Tis true the III Examples of such will have most Followers: Many will be exceed∣ing ready to take Advantage of any thing that looks like Ill in such men, to the hard∣ning themselves in their Sin; and so greedy are many of such Advantages, that they cen∣sure the more innocent Practises of great Men, and put an ill Face on Innocency to justify themselves in what is real Vice. If Ministers and Magistrates do now and then make an innocent Visit to the Tavern, some men will look on themselves Excused, if they sit &amp; Tipple, &amp; spend a great part of their Time there. Tis lamentably true. That ill
<PB N="18" REF="002662_0021_0FE5F97F00D15DA8"/>
Examples of such men will Corrupt not a few. We read of <HI>Manasseh,</HI> that he made <HI>Judah to Sin,</HI> 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 32.9. Which as Divines observe, was done much if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more by his Example than by his Commands. I say that good Examples and bad will have their In∣fluence. The Maxim of old <HI>Claudianus</HI> has truth in it, <HI>Regis ad Exemplum totus Componitur Orbis.</HI> The Historian observes to the Re∣proach of this Nation, <HI>That It changed her Re∣ligion Four times in Twelve Years.</HI> Great Men, says <HI>Trap, are the Country Peoples Looking-glasses, by which they Dress themselves.</HI> Both the Fashi∣ons &amp; Religion of the Court will have their Influence. One observes, that when <HI>Crispus</HI> the Chief Ruler of the Synagogue believed, many of the <HI>Corinthians</HI> believed also, <HI>Act.</HI> 18.8</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Good Rulers will prove Gap-men.</HI> They will be a good Defence many times to a Peo∣ple, and a Means to keep off heavy &amp; awful Judgments. It may be said of them as of him, 2 <HI>King.</HI> 2. 12. They are as <HI>the Chariots &amp; Horsemen of Israel.</HI> True, it may come to that, That God may say as of old, <HI>Tho' Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my Face cannot be toward this People, Jer.</HI>15. 1▪ And, <HI>Wo to such a People.</HI> Yet tis oft better times with a People and a very few may prevail with the Lord to spare &amp; turn away from the

fierceness of His Anger. Tis agreable with God's wonted manner of the Government with a People, when good Rulers stand up Zealously in Pleading the Cause of God, God regards the People for their Sakes One Zealous Justice in a Place, may do a great deal to avert awful impending Judgments. One <HI>Phinehas</HI> of old turned away the Wrath of God from the Lord's Professing People. See <HI>Numb.</HI> 25. 11. So it was in the case of <HI>Achan,</HI> so soon as <HI>Joshua</HI> does Justice upon <HI>Achan,</HI> God's Anger ceases towards the Peo∣ple The Prayers and Intercessions of men in Publick Capacity, are very Prevalent with God: God oft hears the Prayers and Cries of such on the behalf of a poor People, and spares them for the sake of Pious Ru∣lers. If Pious men in a Private Capacity may do much to Save a People, much more may men in Exalted Stations, if good, do to Save a people from Publick Calamities.</P>

their Rulers, such a Government as this Co∣lony is Favoured with. Tis much to be feared, we have many who are weary of their Priviledges, &amp; are willing to part with them, yea to cast them away. Some who are men of restless Spirits &amp; hanker after Novelties, <HI>Nova Placent.</HI> Some of an haughty, self-conceited, aspiring Humour, that long for Advancement. Some again are Crossed in their pretended Interest, and upon a Revo∣lution, hope for a Reparation. Others a∣gain of a mean low Spirit who Cry out of heavy Taxes. Were we under Oppression, what Government under better Advantages to Redress its Grievances, than where they choose their own Governours &amp; Rulers, &amp; <HI>from among themselves?</HI> Tis well known that our Priviledges are of great Value &amp; Worth in the Eyes of other Governments, and we En∣vied on the account of them, by Men and Places not now to be mentioned. Tis pity that <HI>CONNECTICUT</HI> who Enjoy them, should Undervalue them. Tis our Abuse that gives all the reasonable grounds of Un∣easiness. It was of old accounted a great Priviledge, not to have <HI>Strangers set over a People, but such as were of their Brethren, Deut.</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 15. Tis one of the Priviledges spoken of, <HI>Jer.</HI> 30. 20, 21. That <HI>their Governours &amp; their No∣bles should proceed from the midst of them.</HI> And
<PB N="21" REF="002662_0024_0FE5F9A208DB22B8"/>
where so likely as in a Government which may choose their own Rulers?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Then 'tis a Calamitous Time &amp; a Dark Day with a People, who are Governed by Bad Rulers.</HI> If it be an Happy Time with a People under good Rulers, it must then be the Reverse under bad Governours. Such will become <HI>Grins, Traps &amp; Snares,</HI> and bring a great deal of Mischief upon a People. Little good can be Expected from them, but a deal of ill. It was a sad time with them of old, under such Rulers, mentioned, <HI>Isa.</HI> 59. 14, 15. <HI>Judg∣ment is turned away backward, Justice standeth as far off; Truth fails in the streets, &amp; Equity cannot enter; when he that departs from Evil makes him∣self a Prey.</HI> Tis a sad time with a Land, when <HI>wicked men are Exalted, Psal.</HI> 12. 8. Sin will in a little time (without a glorious Revolu∣tion) walk bare-faced through the Streets &amp; ride in the black Chariot of Insolence, and the Land shall Mourn; the Sparks of God's anger will be enkindled to a Flame that won't soon and easily be Quenched: Yea there's great hazard lest the Sluices &amp; Flood-g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> be plucked up and an Inundation of Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y break in. Tis a dreadful sign of God▪ An∣ger, when he gives over a People to be Ruled by such Men. Rulers have many times by their Male-administration, a great hand in
<PB N="22" REF="002662_0025_0FE5F997FAB0B438"/>
pulling down the Judgments of Heaven upon a People. A People may be punished for their Rulers Sins. There are many signal Instances and Examples of it on Scripture Record: Particularly that of <HI>David,</HI> whose Sin in Numbring the People, brought down Mischief upon the Head of the People. Some indeed suppose <HI>David'</HI>s Sin but the Occasion and their own the procuring Cause; but Fa∣mous and Acute <HI>Alsop,</HI> somewhere smiles at such an Opinion. Civil Rulers are Repre∣sentatives &amp; Common Parents, and their Sin may many ways redound to the hurt of the People. Families are ruined by Sin &amp; King∣doms too, ruined by the Heads of them. If great Men do wickedly, they involve many others both in the Guilt and in the Smart: They go to hell with a large Train. See <HI>Henry</HI> on 1 <HI>King.</HI> XIV. Chap.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Then it must follow, that the Removal of Good, Able, Faithful Rulers, brings matter of Lamentation to a Bereaved People.</HI> Tis a dark Day with such a People; Especilly so, when there is little prospect of a Reparation of Breaches. It was a sad time with them of old, when it was said, <HI>Tho' she had had strong Rods to Rule, &amp; her Stature was Exalted,</HI> yet it came to that, <HI>She was plucked up in fury, Ezek.</HI> 19. 11,—Such Cases can scarce be too much

Bewailed. Tis a Day in which an Angry God is calling us in this Government to La∣mentation &amp; Mourning. What shall we say? We are come a'most to a stand. The Lord has been writing bitter things against us and has given us wormwood &amp; gall to drink The Roll that God has written, has been <HI>full of Lamentation &amp; Mourning &amp; Wo, Ezek.</HI> 2. 10. None of the least of the Frowns that appear in the face of God's awful Providence, is that of his <HI>plucking up our Stakes</HI> &amp; <HI>pulling down our Pillars.</HI> Many of the Stars which not long since shined bright and with great lustre in their Orb, are either Removed or Eclipsed, and our Hemisphere is darkned. Among o∣thers that are Removed, our SALTON-STALL is one, a Man TRULY Great. In the Day of his Removal, it might be said, as in the fall of <HI>Abner,</HI> 2 Sam. 3. 38. <HI>This day is a Prince &amp; a great Man fallen.</HI> A Man who shin'd with distinguishing Excellencies in e∣very Station. All Strangers to him at their trials found him a man of unexpected Affa∣bility, and every way a Gentleman. View him where you will! Walking in his House and when under the greatest Trials, in Pa∣tience &amp; self-Command, Uncommon. Eye him at the head of his Troops, and you'll see <HI>Mars</HI> shining in his Lustre and Glory. When on his little Throne surrounded with

his Councillors, he was their Oracle; and his word gave Law to most. His Countenance in∣termix'd with Gravity &amp; Complacency, which Charm'd &amp; Commanded the Admiration of Beholders. His Frowns were more than a match for the daring &amp; impudent. Some have tho't him Comparable to <HI>Argus</HI> King of <HI>Pe∣loponesus,</HI> for his singular Sagacity &amp; Circum∣spection; to <HI>Berianeus,</HI> for his Dexterity and Prowess; to <HI>Bringarius,</HI> for Knowlege, of whom tis said, <HI>He knew all things Knowable.</HI> His Death carries one thing Remarkable in it, which I'v tho't much of; the Deaths &amp; Mortality which preceded &amp; follow'd it, which made us call to mind, what is Recorded of King <HI>James</HI> I. <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>As if a King should not want his Train, some to usher on before, &amp; others to follow after. Such a Mortality of Nobility &amp; Commonalty attended, the like was scarce ever known in this Kingdom.</HI> If any were ready to Magnify <HI>his</HI> Imperfections, let 'em know, that the greatest &amp; best of Men have their Butt's. As for his Superior Ex∣cellencies, what are imitable let us follow, what above our reach, let us admire; and as becometh, let supposed Infirmities be cover'd with the mantle of Charity &amp; a most candid Interpretation. <HI>Elias</HI> himself was a man of like Passion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The greatest of Men are but men, &amp; he that looks for more of any, abuses both him and others too.</P>

4. <HI>Then let this teach a People priviledged with good Rulers, the deep Obligations &amp; Engagements they are under to Gratitude &amp; Respect.</HI> It be∣comes them upon their bended Knees to ac∣knowlege God's Favour &amp; distinguishing Be∣novelence to them-ward. Tis owing to <HI>Him</HI> that such Rulers are set up among a People, <HI>Prov.</HI> 8. 16. He tis that sets up <HI>one</HI> &amp; pulls down <HI>another, Psal.</HI> 75. 7.

God should be Ac∣knowleged when he gives them Rulers after <HI>his own Heart.</HI></P>
<P>There's an Obligation of Respect due to good Rulers themselves too, from a People. A People are bound to reverence &amp; obey such. To do all they can to strengthen their hands &amp; encourage their hearts. Men should not indulge themselves in mean &amp; low tho'ts of Rulers, or their Office-work. They should likewise chearfully &amp; liberally Support them in their several Relations, and Reward them for their good Services. To do otherwise is base Ingratitude both to God and Man. A base &amp; niggardly Spirit is far from an Honour to a People so priviledged. A good Gover∣nour should <HI>eat the Bread of a Governour, Neh.</HI> V<HI>th. Chapt.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Sirs,</HI> It must be owned to be a dark and gloomy Day, in the which a glorious and merciful God, is Advancing You to the Head of Rule &amp; Government among us.

Holy and Jealous God has a Controversy with this Land; God is writing <HI>bitter things against us</HI> in such fiery Characters, as me∣thinks, should make them Legible &amp; Obvious to all. Our Righteous God is many ways testifying <HI>his Displeasure</HI> against us &amp; we can't expect the removal of Gods Anger without Repentance &amp; Reformation. see <HI>Josh.</HI> 7. 12. <HI>Hos.</HI> 5. 12, 14, 15. And 'tis the important Duty &amp; Interest of every one to say as they, Lam. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 40. <HI>Let us search our ways &amp; turn to the Lord</HI> our God. But no small Article in our Malady, is a Spirit of Insensibility. Some are so Sottish as to own no great reason for Reformation: They think it fares as well with us now, as Forty or Fifty Years ago; and that there's as much Religion now as then, in Proportion to the Number of the People. They are ignorant men and objects of Pity. But among such as own the great need of Reformation, there is a great deal of Division: They are not agreed what 'tis that is the <HI>Achan</HI> &amp; Troubler of our Peace, or <HI>what Sins</HI> are the incendiaries, and that blow up the sparks of Gods Anger into so high a Flame. <HI>Sirs,</HI> Tis by so much the more your Work &amp; Business, to study and consult where and how to begin &amp; push forward a Reformation. Tis the important Duty of Magistrates &amp; Ministers jointly to Engage

themselves in this important Affair. And, Oh! That our <HI>Civil Rulers</HI> would in their respective Capacities, seriously and solemnly Consider what might and ought be done in this our Day<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ I am perswaded great things might be done. Good Rulers when in good earnest, have oft done great &amp; good Services. <HI>Hezekiah, Josiah</HI> &amp; others are Instances of it. Tho' they cannot <HI>change the Heart,</HI> yet they may and can <HI>reform the Life.</HI> They cannot <HI>Mortify,</HI> yet they can <HI>Curb</HI> &amp; <HI>Restrain</HI> the Corruption and ill-manners of a People in good measure and degree. <HI>Sirs,</HI> Your Cries to God for us &amp; a distinguishing Zeal, becom∣ing your Character, might have glorious Ef∣fects. If the People Perish, let not the fault ly at your Doors. And know that God looks on you as Guardians to His and his Peoples interest, and expects much from you.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Let us have Laws Necessary, well Explain∣ed and Enforced.</HI></P>
<P>(1.) <HI>Sharpen the Sword of Justice as there shall be occasion.</HI> Let Penalties affixed be pro∣portioned to the Offence &amp; the Aggravations thereof. Tis a great blemish to a Christian Common-wealth, when lesser Crimes are more severely Punished, than higher and greater Offences. I fear, that in some cases wherein the Name of God &amp; the Interest of Religion are more especially concern'd, there
<PB N="31" REF="002662_0034_0FE5F96CE83A5700"/>
wants greater acumen and keeness: The pe∣nalty which may be Sufficient to restrain a Vice in one Age, may be much too Low in another.</P>
<P>(2.) <HI>It might be well if some especially, of our Laws were mended and Explicated,</HI> and it might hopefully be done to good Purpose in many Instances. 'Tis much to be feared that many Officers, Grand-jurors &amp; Justices too, are many times wretchedly short in their Duty. And when we Consider the Solemn Ty's of the Oath of God upon them, we are Loth to account for their gross De∣fects in any other way than this, of assigning for the grand Cause thereof, their Un∣acquaintedness with the Nature, Sense and Meaning of the Laws. 'Tis pity but that they might be helped.</P>
<P>(3.) <HI>Let me humbly recommend to your Se∣rious Consideration, whether some more Effectual method ought not to be taken to give Force to the Laws and invigorate the just Execution of them, at Least, in many Instances.</HI> May not a Se∣verer Penalty for the Neglect of Inferior Officers be of great Service? 'Tis beyond Contradiction, that Vice grows, notwith∣standing our good and wholesome Laws; the Laws Slighted, Baffled and Neglected. Intemperance, Tavern-haunting, Sabbath-breaking and Uncleanness are very Com∣mon.

(1.) <HI>Beware of men of a Temporizing Spirit:</HI> Such as easily swim down the Stream and Currant of the Times and Places in which they live: Such who easily Conform them∣selves to almost any thing, to serve a turn. Men who can shift their Sails to suit the wind of Temptation of Self-interest. Rulers should be men of steady Principles, and such as won't readily warp.
