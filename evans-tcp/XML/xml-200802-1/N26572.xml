HISTORY OF THE YELLOW FEVER.</HEAD>
<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Sketch of the situation of Philadelphia—State of the city—Re∣marks upon the weather and diseases of man and other animals previous to the appearance of the Yellow Fever, in 1798.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>PHILADELPHIA, the metropolis of the United States of America, is situated in 39 degrees 56 minutes of North latitude, and 75 degrees 9 minutes of longitude, West from London; is upon the West bank of the river Delaware, and about 120 miles, by the course of the river, from the At∣lantic Ocean, and is 6 miles above the junction of the Schuylkill with the Delaware.</P>
<P>Agreeable to its original plan, it extends from the Dela∣ware, which is on the East, to the Schuylkill, on the West, making a plot of about two miles in length, and about one mile in breadth, North and South. The ground is level, and generally moist; its medium height, above the level of the two waters, is thirty-four to forty feet.—The principal part of the surrounding country is level, ge∣nerally cleared of woods, and under cultivation: a conside∣rable portion of that between the city and confluence of the rivers, commonly called the Neck, is meadow ground, low
<PB N="6" REF="035335_0005_100231A09CEC5BA0"/>
and consequently moist; in the vicinity of the rivers, it is frequently overflowed, and subjects the inhabitants to <HI>fever-and-ague.</HI> But, towards the North and North-West, the si∣tuation is much higher. The river Delaware, opposite the city, is about one mile broad; the tide rises six feet perpendicu∣lar, and flows at the rate of four miles an hour; its opposite shore, in the state of Jersey, is level; the soil dry and sandy.</P>
<P>The buildings do not at present extend over half the ground designated in the original plan; as the inhabitants, from ob∣vious commercial advantages, have preferred the Delaware front rather than the Schuylkill: hence, at present, the hou∣ses extend nearly three miles North and South along the De∣laware, and about three-quarters of a mile due West toward the Schuylkill. They are chiefly built with bricks, from two to five stories high; the streets are regular, wide and airy, except Water-street, which occupies the space between the bank upon which Front-street is built, and the river, which was originally designed for stores. It is the narrowest, yet one of the most populous in the city: the street is only thirty feet wide, and but a little above the sur∣face of the tide: the houses are high, and the greater part of them have no yards, particularly those situated on the West or bank side; an inconvenience which tends much to render the street more nauseous. It is much confined, ill-aired, and, in every respect, is a disagreeable street. There are se∣veral alleys in the city, which are also narrow, confined and filthy.</P>
<P>The river, for nearly the whole extent of the city, is in∣dented with forced wharves, made, as is usual, of square case∣ments, with logs, and filled with earth, vessels-ballast, stones, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Where Dock-street is now built, in former years, was a swamp or canal, with a small stream of water running through it, extending from the river to Third-street, which became a general nuisance, and a common reservoir for the filth of a large part of the city. It now forms a handsome, airy, serpentine street, having an arch underneath, covered with earth, and paved. This concave sewer begins beyond Sixth-street, in Potter's-Field, and is carried under ground below the jail to Walnut-street, and down Walnut street to Dock-street, between Second and Third-streets, and from thence down Dock-street to the river. At necessary distan∣ces, there are apertures left to receive the water from the gutters of the adjacent streets: these openings, in the intense
<PB N="7" REF="035335_0006_100231A2EA4BCA10"/>
heat of summer, emit a very disagreeable stench. There are several sinks dug, to receive the water from the gutters, in those parts of the city, where there is no other declivity to carry it off. Two of these, which are the most remarkable, are situated in Market-street, at the corner of Fourth-street. They, like the apertures to the Dock-street sewer, exhale the most noxious effluvia; for, dead animals and every kind of nausea, are thrown into them, and there remain till they become putrified. During the sickness in summer 1797, Dr. Pascalis mentions, that being frequently called out dur∣ing the night, he could strongly perceive the smell issuing from these sinks in Market-street as far as Mulberry-street on the one side, and Chesnut-street on the other.</P>
<P>A few years ago, there were numbers of marshes and ponds of stagnant water, in the out-lots of the city, which periodically subjected the inhabitants surrounding them to fever-and-ague. These public nuisances are now either drained, filled up, or built upon; since which, but few are troubled with this complaint. There are, still, some re∣maining in Southwark and the Northern Liberties: there are also many vacancies on the bank of the river, which are co∣vered with a thick bed of miery filth; the wharves, likewise, at times, become filled up with impure substances from the adjoining streets; and, during the summer, emit, at low wa∣ter, a very offensive smell. A small stream of water, called Pegg's Run, passes through Spring-Garden and the Nor∣thern Liberties, the bottom of which is wide and miery; its banks are unimproved, and rendered offensive by the offals which are thrown upon them from the slaughter-houses, tan-yards, &amp;c. adjoining. Beyond this, upon the Delaware, the improvements called Kensington, are situated. A great part of which, at high water, is nearly surrounded by the tide, which, when low, leaves a broad, muddy marsh, more than a quarter of a mile round its south and west parts.—Upon this, the heat in summer, as might be expected, pro∣duces similar effects. One other source of putrid animal exhalation, which very forcibly attracts the notice of stran∣gers, is most sensibly discovered in thickly inhabited places during the summer months. Most every dwelling of the city has a privy-house, situated generally at the farthest end of the yard; but the houses on the bank side of Front-street, have them in their cellars: many of the sinks, over which they stand, are dug to the depth of between twenty to thirty feet, and built round with bricks: They are not
<PB N="8" REF="035335_0007_100231A4822E1B00"/>
cleaned till nearly full, which is once in ten or twelve years, and then, in many cases, it is considered easier to cover them over, and dig others. After many years fermentation, these sinks exhale a very putrid and offensive effluvia, which is abundantly emitted when the air is moist, calm or sultry, particularly towards the end of summer, or after the action of severe heat has excited the putrefactive fermentation.—The inhabitants are still so well apprised of its consequence, and knowing that the depth of their wells is not a sufficient preventative against this offensive exhalation, that they gene∣rally provide their necessaries with an air-pipe, rising a few feet from the top; but still, under particular circumstances of the atmosphere, the ascending effluvia is frequently diffused round the houses, alleys, &amp;c. where it is highly nauseous. Some idea of the noxious quality of this gas may be formed from the effects which it produces upon combustion. If a lighted candle is let down one of these sinks, it will fre∣quently be extinguished.</P>
<P>There are many grave yards in the city, and perhaps some other sources of putrid exhalation, which are in a manner incident to all large cities. It is not supplied with running wa∣ter or fountains; but with pump-wells, in distributive num∣ber, through the city and suburbs; many of which, perhaps, from a communication with the adjacent necessaries, have already become unfit even to wash the houses.</P>
<P>The foregoing description is chiefly confined to those cir∣cumstances which are more particularly connecte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with the object of our undertaking; for, notwithstanding these incon∣veniencies, still there are few cities that can vie with Phila∣delphia in point of elegance or even cleanliness: the streets intersect each other at right angles, and are open to the winds from all points; which, together with their width, regular pavement, conveniency of foot-ways, and the practice of the inhabitants of frequently washing the outsides of their hou∣ses, give to the city a singular appearance of regularity and neatness, highly admired by foreigners.</P>
<P>The City and Liberties are estimated to contain about ten thousand houses, and the number of inhabitants is not over∣rated when we estimate the total between fifty-five and sixty thousand souls. But, notwithstanding this increase of population, the prosperity of the city has not equalled that of former years. The European wars, at an early pe∣riod, produced considerable changes on the trade, property and necessaries of life in Philadelphia. The first influx of
<PB N="9" REF="035335_0008_100231A797861070"/>
foreigners from Europe and the West-Indies raised the mar∣kets, house-rents, &amp;c. and gave to the city, in general, a flou∣rishing appearance; property rose above its accustomed va∣lue. But the same cause has, of late years, been productive of very different effects; and our once flourishing trade has suffered very considerable diminution: Citizens over-reach∣ing their capitals, the general failure of land speculation, the depredations committed upon our commerce, together with the general stagnation of trade in almost every depart∣ment, has of late been followed by an increased number of bankrupt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es, that at least equal any period since the revolu∣tion. Such a combination of untoward circumstances could hardly fail of producing numberless distresses. But evils of a more serious nature followed: That malignant scourge of mankind, the Yellow Fever, again appeared in the city, marking its path with unprecedented horror and devastation. Scarcely recovered from the baleful effects which it produced, last year, in the months of August, Sep∣tember and October, which dispersed more than two-thirds of the inhabitants; cut off near thirteen hundred of those that remained, and added to the already general distress a number of helpless widows and orphans, formerly in afflu∣ence, but then reduced to want and poverty, in a severe and inclement winter, Philadelphia was this year again doomed to experience a repetition of these baneful consequences, in a degree far beyond any former period, when mediocrity of circumstances enabled citizens, by a timely flight, to escape from a premature Death. Before, however, we en∣ter upon the detail of these melancholy events, we shall state a few primary observations on the state of the weather and the antecedent diseases.</P>
<P>Our climate is supposed, within the few last years, to have undergone very considerable changes: the winters are expe∣rienced to be less cold, and the summers less warm than they were 40 or 50 years ago. It is also said, that the climate has become more favourable to the generation of epidemic dis∣eases, particularly fevers of the bilious type; and that the late recurrence of the Yellow Fever, is, in part, to be ascri∣bed to this cause. The Academy of Medicine, in their ob∣servations, last year, upon the origin of this pestilence, ad∣dressed to the Governor of Pennsylvania, mention, that "at present a constitution of the atmosphere prevails in the Uni∣ted States, which disposes to fevers of a highly inflammatory
<PB N="10" REF="035335_0009_100231AB74367868"/>
character, and that it began in the year 1793."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Ruth's works, vol. 4, P. 47.</NOTE> The want of meteorological observations during former years, renders it difficult to decide upon the first opinion; but, there is rea∣son to believe, that the changes observed in the temperature of the atmosphere are not so considerable as is imagined: The cutting down of woods and the partial cultivation of the soil may have somewhat contributed more to equalize it.—But we do not discover that the change produced, even in consequence of cultivation, is in any respect equal to what has been produced from the same cause in other countries. History informs us "that when Germany and Scythia aboun∣ded in forests, the Romans often transported their armies across the frozen Danube; but, since the cultivation of these regions, the Danube rarely freezes." Nor have we reason to believe that the climate is, in any degree, more favora∣ble to the generation of bilious or epidemic diseases; for, if it is gradually becoming more temperate and equal, and a great proportion of the stagnant marshes in the neigh∣bourhood of the cities are drained and cultivated, the cause, which produced these diseases are, of course, every day de∣creasing, and the climate becoming more healthy than in former years.</P>
<P>There are but few climates more changeable or irregular than that of Pennsylvania; scarcely two successive years, or even days, are alike.</P>
<P>The heat in summer and the cold in winter are intense. The mercury, in Fahrenheit's thermometer, has been known to rise to 96° in summer, and to fall 5° below 0 in winter. There is not, however, more than one month in summer or winter in which the mercury rises above 80° in the one, or falls below 30° in the other. The barometer is but little af∣fected by the changes of the atmosphere in this climate; its medium height is 30 inches. The warmest weather is gene∣rally about the end of July and beginning of August; altho' intensely warm days are frequently felt in May, June and September. "The warmest part of the day in summer is at two, in ordinary, and at three o'clock in the afternoon in extremely warm weather. From these hours, the heat gra∣dually diminishes till the ensuing morning. The coolest part of the four-and-twenty hours is at the break of day. Af∣ter the warmest days, the evenings are generally agreeable, and often delightful. The higher the mercury rises in the
<PB N="11" REF="035335_0010_100231AD1EF2F940"/>
day time, the lower it falls the succeeding night. The mer∣cury at 80° generally falls to 68° while it descends, when at 60° only to 56°. This disproportion between the tempera∣ture of the day and night in summer, is always greatest in the month of August. The dews at this time are heavy in proportion to the coolness of the evening; they are sometimes so considerable as to wet the clothes." It is seldom that two or three successive warm days occur without being succeeded with showers of rain, accompanied sometimes by thunder and lightning, and afterwards by a North-West wind, which produces a coolness in the air, that is highly invigorating and agreeable. The transitions from heat to cold are often sudden and considerable. After a day in which the mercury has stood at 86° and even 90°, it sometimes falls in the course of a single night to the 65th, and even the 60th de∣gree. The frost generally begins to show itself about the end of October or beginning of November; but the intense cold seldom sets in till about the middle of December, and the coldest weather is commonly in January. The mean temperature of the air in Philadelphia during the whole year is 52½°, which is the temperature of the deepest wells, and of common spring water. The wind in winter generally blows from the N. W. in fair, and from the N. E. in wet weather. The N. W. winds are uncommonly cold and dry. S. W. and W. N. W. winds generally prevail during the dry warm weather in summer, while the wind from N. E. is frequently accompanied by rain. Thunder and light∣ning are less frequent than in former years.</P>
<P>To the preceding observations, we may add that May and June are usually the healthiest months in the year. The excessive heat in summer has frequently been known to prove fatal to persons who are much exposed to it. Its mor∣bid effects discover themselves by a difficulty in breathing, a general languor, and, in some instances, by a numbness and an immobility of the extremities. The excessive cold like∣wise proves fatal to many, particularly old persons. The night air is always unwholesome in the summer and fall months, particularly during the state of sleep. The frequent and sudden changes of the air from heat to cold, renders it unsafe at any time to sleep with open windows.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding what has been said of the variable na∣ture of the climate of Pennsylvania, it does not necessarily result that it is unhealthy; perhaps no climate is unhealthy
<PB N="12" REF="035335_0011_100231AF7250B108"/>
where the inhabitants acquire, from experience, the arts of accommodating themselves to it.</P>
<P>We are indebted to Dr. Rush's ingenious and elaborate essay, upon the climate of Pennsylvania, for many of the above general remarks. In addition to which, we are indu∣ced to make a few observations upon the state of the wea∣ther previous to the last appearance of the yellow fever; for, an opinion prevails with many, that it and other pesti∣lential diseases in general, are connected with a particular state of atmosphere, and may be prognosticated prior to their appearance. A similarity observed to exist between the constitution of man and many of the domestic ani∣mals, has also led some to suppose that certain pestilential fluids, acting upon the system, produce particular and near∣ly similar effects upon both. They likewise trace a simila∣rity between animal life and vegetation, from having obser∣ved, that the seasons in which mortal sickness has prevailed among men and animals, has also proved unfavourable to ve∣getables.</P>
<P>Spring set in this year with very promising appearances; the ice broke up early, and it being followed by plentiful rains, soon dissolved. Vegetation commenced: but this premature aspect was not of long duration. It was succeeded by cold weather, North-West winds, frequent showers of hail and slight frosts in the night, which were dissolved by the heat of the sun on the succeeding day. During the whole spring, the sudden changes of the weather, from heat to cold, were more frequent and extreme than have been known for many years past. Even after the season was so far advanced that the fruit-trees had put forth their blossoms, there was a smart shower of hail. A few days preceding it, the weather was warm and sultry, inasmuch, that many persons put off their winter cloathing, and afterwards caught cold by the sudden change of weather. The flower buds, blossoms, and young fruit, in many places, received considerable injury.—During the months of May and June, white frost, more than once, occurred; and, in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia, in the afternoon of the 14th July, there was a shower of hail, and upon the morning of the 19th, there was a slight frost.</P>
<P>The weather, during the months of July and August, me∣rits particular attention; for, if a state of atmosphere favou∣rable to the generation of the Yellow Fever ever prevails, it must be during those months; as the first cases occurred in
<PB N="13" REF="035335_0012_100231B1C57B80E0"/>
July; and, towards the end of August, it was general over the whole city. In the years 1793 and 1797, as well as this year, the fever made its appearance nearly about the same period, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the end of July and beginning of August, although, by comparing the meteorological registers for each of those years, we do not find that the weather during this period has been in any two years alike.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Journal of the state of the weather, annexed hereto.</NOTE> The month of July, this year, commenced with remarkable hot weather. The middle of the month was cold, and the weather in the end, like the beginning, was warm. On the 2d, 3d, 27th, 28th and 29th days, Fahrenheit's thermometer, in the shade, stood from 88 to 92½ degrees, and in many places it stood at 95° and even at 96°. A number of other phaenomena have oc∣curred this year, which attracted the attention of the curi∣ous observer; and, as these appearances are supposed, by many, to be connected with that state of weather, which they suppose produces the disease, it may be proper to notice them. Thunder and lightning appeared earlier this year, and less frequent than usual. The middle of spring and of summer was remarkably dry: the grass meadows produced but a scanty crop of hay and, towards the end of summer, whole fields of grass were, in many places, entirely withered up. Many tribes of insects were uncommonly nu∣merous; as musquitoes, ants, crickets, cockroaches, &amp;c. The grasshoppers were scarcely ever known to appear in such vast quantities. In the neighbourhood of Philadelphia, they ate up all the grass, even to the roots, scarcely any kind of herbage escaped them; whole fields of cabbage and potatoes were almost entirely devoured. They were succeeded by myriads of black crickets; the different species of caterpil∣lars were also uncommonly numerous this season; the trees, in many places, lost their foliage by them; but in September they put forth a second crop of leaves. Instances have like∣wise occurred of fruit-trees blossoming a second time, and producing fruit late in the fall. The different classes of mush∣rooms were found in great abundance during their sea∣son. Purslane, during the dry hot weather, continued to grow without putting forth leaves, while the jamison weed flourished luxuriantly. The crop of apples was greatly in∣jured by worms; this was so general all over the country that the cyder this year is tainted with their acrid taste. These, and other similar phaenomena, have occurred in former years
<PB N="14" REF="035335_0013_1001FE8EC3040C88"/>
when this disorder was unknown, without attracting any particular notice; but, since the appearance of it in the United States, every uncommon occurrence in nature has been observed with an anxious wish to discover in it a con∣nection with the cause of this fatal evil.</P>
<P>A short time previous to the appearance of the fever, a remarkable disease occurred among the cats and rats in Phi∣ladelphia, which carried off many hundreds of them. After the commencement of the sickness, the dogs also were affec∣ted. The disease which raged among the cats was similar to that which attacked these animals previous to the appearance of the yellow fever in Philadelphia last year, and in New-York in 1796. Little attention has been paid to ascertain the precise symptoms of this disease, so far as we know. In ge∣neral, the animal was without appetite, but thirsty; and, at first, much inclined to sleep; of a dull, melancholy turn, and soon began to look weak and thin. Many died in a numb and torpid state, while others, in the last stage of the disease, were seized with a delirium, puking, and an uncommon flow of frothy saliva from the mouth. A moaning or groaning noise was also very common—These are the general symptoms, so far as we have observed them. In former periods, very little attention was paid to the study of the dis∣eases incident to the brute creation. But, of late years, and particularly since the repeated appearance of the yellow fe∣ver in different parts of the United States, it has produced more observation; and, it is to be hoped, that a further and more minute examination of the nature of the epidemic dis∣eases of the brute animals, will add much new and useful in∣formation to the healing art, particularly so far as it relates to epidemic diseases among mankind.</P>
<P>As distempers among domestic animals have more than once been observed to precede the yellow fever among the human species, and, by many, are now looked upon as their sure harbinger, it is made, use of as an argument to corroborate the idea of domestic origin, and to strengthen the theory of the prevalence of certain pestilential fluids.</P>
<P>In order, therefore, to prevent the adoption of any wrong or hasty conclusions upon this interesting subject, in the pre∣sent imperfect state of our knowledge of its cause, or cir∣cumstances attending these diseases, we shall state what in∣formation we have been able to collect, in hopes, that it may be of use in some future period, to direct us to more just and certain conclusions.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="035335_0014_100231B7F6C623F8"/>
During the months of March and April 1797, a remarka∣ble disease occurred among the cats in London, and extended over several other parts of England. In three parishes in London, upwards of 5,000 cats were computed to have been destroyed by it within a fortnight. The common pe∣riod of the disorder is said to have been six or seven days.—The following is extracted from the "Account of the disea∣ses in London, for the months of March and April, 1797," published in the Monthly Magazine, on this subject:</P>
<P>"After the abatement of the epidemic catarrh, a violent disease fell among the cats, by which many hundreds of those domestic animals perished: the particular symptoms of their malady, I had not sufficient opportunity of ascertaining: but, from dissections, it appears, that the bowels had been drawn together by a violent cramp or spasmodic constriction, in∣volving likewise the omentum, and preventing any passage. In some, the intestines were partially red, or blackish; but, in the greater number of instances, the contraction and extra∣ordinary twisting of the bowels, had taken place, without any marks of inflammation."</P>
<P>This is probably the same disease which has appeared among the cats, in various parts of the United States. It made its appearance in Philadelphia in the latter end of May or beginning of June, 1797, when it was computed to have destroyed four or five thousand cats. In New-York it was first observed in August, 1797. During its continuance there, a number of the cats, as was said, left the city, and took refuge in the neighbouring country houses. The number that died, was supposed to be three or four thousand. In two instances, it was observed that lap-dogs, which were wont to play with the cats in the houses to which they belonged, were affected with a similar complaint. A distemper appeared among the cats in Hartford (Connecticut) about the end of July or beginning of August, 1797, where it carried off the greater part of these animals. It appeared in Ports∣mouth (N. H.) about the same period; at Boston in Septem∣ber; at Albany in October, and at Poughkeepsie, state of New-York, towards the end of November. The same year it was also observed in many of the other towns in the Uni∣ted States. We do not know of any instance of its being observed in any of the country places; but it was chiefly confined to the large cities. From a Bourdeaux newspaper of October, 1797, it appears that France has been visited by a similar epidemic amongst the cats. One of the health of¦ficers
<PB N="16" REF="035335_0015_1001FE91F7A3B6A0"/>
had opened the body of a cat to discover the cause, and found in it a knot of worms. The name of the place is not mentioned, nor is there any other important information ad∣ded to the account.</P>
<P>Many other animals, besides the cats, have of late been subject to the influence of similar epidemics: Hydrophobia, or ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine madness, has prevailed in many parts of the coun∣try, particularly in the states of New-England. It prevail∣ed in the town <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Hartford, Connecticut, in October, 1797, to such an alarming degree, that the magistrates of the town were induced to exert the authority vested in them by a law of the state, for the confinement of all the dogs. Several other places were visited about the same period with this dreadful disease. In Rhode-Island, several persons and cat∣tle were bitten by mad dogs and died. The same circum∣stance took place in Berkshire, Massachusetts, and in many of the towns in the state of Connecticut. The Rabies, ano∣ther dreadful distemper, prevailed among the dogs, in the same districts and about the same period. It first appeared in the town of Berlin, about 12 miles from Hartford, (Con.) in the beginning of March, 1797. Shortly after, the same disease appeared at Hartford, New-Haven, Salem, Spring∣field; and, in many neighbouring parts in the state of Mas∣sachusetts, where it proved fatal to some children, who were bitten by infected dogs. Numbers of cattle also died from the same cause. A peculiar distemper prevailed among the dogs in Philadelphia, this summer, at the beginning of the sickness; perhaps it was produced from a want of sustenance among those who were left by their owners in the city. It is not in our power to state the precise symptoms, nor even the period of the disease. In the generality of cases, the ani∣mal appeared pensive and dejected; did not refuse food; but made no exertions to procure it; gradually became lean, and, in the last stage, would run to distant places, as if seized with canine madness; but, fortunately, when in this state, they never attempted to bite any person or to do harm; nor would they even enter the house; but, when exhausted, laid down in the fields and died. At a farm house, about six miles from Philadelphia, we are informed, that three or four dogs came sick from the city, in one day, and expired in the farm yard.</P>
<P>A very violent pestilential disorder prevailed among the cattle in many parts of Germany in the year 1796. Profes∣sor Reich, of the university of Erlangen, has wrote a small
<PB N="17" REF="035335_0016_100231BE82FEFF90"/>
tract upon the subject; and, we understand, he accounts for it upon the doctrine of pestilential fluids, as laid down by Dr. Mitchell, of New-York. A disease of a very singular nature has prevailed among the cattle in many parts of the state of Connecticut, for ten or twelve years past; an account of which is inserted in the Medical Repository, published at New-York, vol. 1, page 335.</P>
<P>In some parts of Massachusetts and New-Hampshire, the foxes, during the winter of 1797-8, have been affected with a disorder which rendered them an easy prey to the hunters. Of the particular symptoms, we have not been able to obtain any correct accounts. We are also informed, that geese, in some of the eastern states, have been affected in a singular manner. Many have been known to seize some living ob∣jects with their bills, and adhere to them till they died.</P>
<P>Nor are the land animals, alone, the objects of these dis∣eases. In the beginning of August 1797, a great mortality prevailed among the fish in James river, Virginia; the dead fish were seen floating down the river in astonishing quan∣tities. In the summer of 1795, a similar mortality occurred among the fish in Saratoga lake; and, some years ago, a disease is said to have destroyed great numbers of fish in a pond near the town of Brookfield, in the state of Massachu∣setts.</P>
<P>What references are to be deduced from these circumstan∣ces, we leave for the medical Philosopher to determine. But it does not appear very probable, that they are in any measure connected with the cause which produced the yellow fever among the human species; as they do not always appear in those seasons or places when and where that prevails, but generally in the most remote parts of the country, which is free from this human scourge.</P>
<P>We shall close this part of our subject with an account of the diseases which prevailed in Philadelphia previous to its general calamity, as appeared in the Philadelphia Monthly Magazine for July, 1798.</P>
<P>"July commenced with uncommonly hot weather; the city being pretty free from sickness. The cholera infantum prevailed and carried off many children. On the 8th of the month, much rain fell, and the air became suddenly moist and cool. Many cases of cholera and several of dysentery occurred immediately afterwards. The subduction of heat from the skin, the torpor of its vessels, and the accumulation of blood in the internal parts, in consequence of the appli∣cation
<PB N="18" REF="035335_0017_100231C31F6B2AC8"/>
of cold to the body, might have been circumstances favourable to the production of these diseases.</P>
<P>"A number of days, about the middle of the month, were extremely cool; especially in the morning and evening: some of them very much resembled autumnal weather. To∣wards the close of the month, some cases of bilious fever, of a malignant nature, appeared; the weather was showery and became warmer.</P>
<P>"In treating the cholera infantum, bleeding, calomel, and blisters, were used with advantage. Sometimes any one of these remedies would cure the disease. At other times, the whole of them would prove ineffectual, when it was very violent, or when medical assistance was delayed. The cold bath cured some slight cases, and was employed with advan∣tage in the convalescent state of this disease.</P>
<P>"In the dysentery which occurred, the usual remedies were successful; such as salts, castor-oil, laudanum, &amp;c. The laudanum, combined with antimonial wine, and given in the first and latter part of the night, proved most serviceable. In a violent case of the complaint, bleeding, blisters and sali∣vation were used with success."</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>First appearance of the Disease—General alarm—Flight of the inhabitants, &amp;c.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE now proceed to the task of recording the rise, progress and attendant circumstances of the late Yellow Fever, the most tremendous scourge, perhaps, ever experi∣enced in the United States.</P>
<P>Its origin is still as much a subject of controversy as in 1793. Those who support the idea of its domestic growth, insist much on the long duration of moist, sultry weather, the filth and stagnant water collected in our streets, inat∣tention of scavengers, foul air discharged from the holds of vessels, with their cargoes, ballast, &amp;c. The disciples of this system are, the <HI>Academy of Medicine</HI> and their ad∣herents. The arguments brought forward in support of the above doctrine, are strongly opposed by the <HI>College of Physicians,</HI> and their adherents. They insist that it has been, most unequivocally, imported; that the weather has not been more sultry this season than in many other years, in which not even a sporadic case of the disorder was met with; that the police of our streets is vastly better than formerly, especially during the period that the British troops were here, and im∣mediately subsequent to their abandonment of the city. With respect to the construction of a city, very few are equal, hardly any superior, to Philadelphia; the ventilation of which, is completely secured, let the wind blow in what∣ever direction it may, by its streets intersecting each other at right angles.</P>
<P>Independent of these general arguments, it is contended, that the disease can be as satisfactorily traced to the vessel or vessels that introduced it, as the nature of the case will admit. For, it has been observed, that it is one of those cases, which will hardly admit of positive or judicial proof.</P>
<P>The examination of the nature and origin of the disease, we shall treat, at large, in another part of this work; and, at
<PB N="28" REF="035335_0027_100231D8CE5D0C38"/>
present, confine our inquiry only to the narration of those circumstances which occurred, and excited general alarm in the city during the period of its prevalence; but, it is necessary to remark, that a difference of opinion also exists respecting the <HI>nature</HI> of the yellow fever: Those in fa∣vour of its importation, assert that it is a distinct and spe∣cific disease, of itself, and highly contagious. Those in favor of its domestic origin, affirm, that it is only a higher grade of the common bilious fever of this country, and that it is sel∣dom or never contagious.</P>
<P>Some cases of highly bilious fever occurred so early as the month of June; and, perhaps, some even of yellow fever may have occurred during the months of June and July. The Academy of Medicine, in a letter to the Governor of Pennsylvania, dated December 3, 1798, mention eight ca∣ses of the fever, which occurred between June 2d and July 12th; but, it does not appear, that the disease was commu∣nicated by infection from any of the cases they mention; nor was any alarm excited till after that period.</P>
<P>Many of the inhabitants suspected, that, in certain places, the poison might remain during the winter, in the houses, beds and apparel of those who died with, or who had, the fever the preceding year, and that the heat of the sun might again bring it into action this summer, perhaps from a sus∣picion, founded upon a reference to the transient recurrence of a few cases of the yellow fever, in the fall which succee∣ded 1793. Upon which account, it was natural to expect, that the inhabitants would be upon their guard, and use every means in their power to prevent the return of so dreadful a calamity; and, if it should be found impossible to prevent it, that they would, upon its first appearance, sound the alarm.</P>
<P>The legislature of Pennsylvania, having found, by experience, that the existing "laws, for preventing the importation of infectious or contagious diseases into the port of Philadel∣phia, and the Health-Office system thereby established, were defective and inadequate," in April, 1798, passed "an Act to alter and amend the same, and to extend the powers of the Board of Health." Agreeable to the tenor of this law, a Board of Health was instituted. They entered upon the important and arduous duties of their office in the be∣ginning of May last; and, although they were convin∣ced that the new one was still defective, and inade∣quate to the purposes contemplated by its framers, they
<PB N="29" REF="035335_0028_1001FE97160F1840"/>
were determined to make up for its deficiency, if possible, by their own vigilance.</P>
<P>On the 1st of May, the following extract from An act to alter and amend the health laws of Pennsylvania, passed the 4th of April, was published by order of the Board of Health, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> "Sec. 8. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that every house-keeper within the city of Phila∣delphia, the townships of the Northern Liberties and Moya∣mensing, and district of Southwark, within one mile of the limits of the city, taking in boarders, arriving by sea or by land, from any foreign port or place, and having any board∣er in his or her family, who shall be taken sick of any disease whatsoever, between the first day of May and the first day of November, in any year, within twenty days next after such boarder shall come to lodge in his or her house, shall, within twenty-four hours next after the knowledge of such sickness, make report at the Health-Office of the name of such sick person, the time of his or her arrival at the house, and of his or her being taken sick, and of the name and place of abode of such housekeeper; whereupon the Physician of the Health-Office shall forthwith visit the patient, and report to the Office his opinion of the nature of such disease, that mea∣sures may be taken to prevent the spreading of infection; and if any house-keeper shall neglect to give information in the manner and within the time aforesaid, and shall be there∣of convicted, in any court of criminal jurisdiction within this commonwealth, upon indictment or confession, he or she shall forfeit and pay a fine to the use of the said hospital, not less than twenty dollars, nor more than one hundred dol∣lars, to be imposed at the discretion of the court, according to the circumstances of greater or less aggravation attending each particular case."</P>
<P>The 5th section of the same law enacted, "That all vessels arriving at the port of Philadelphia, during the months of May, June, July, August, September, October and November, from any port in the Mediterranean, or wa∣ters connected therewith to the eastward of the Straits of Gibraltar, or from the coast of Africa without the Straits, other than the Cape of Good Hope, and from the main land of North or South-America, or the West-India Islands, be∣tween the latitude of the river St. Mary in Georgia, and the beginning of the latitude of thirty degrees south of the equa∣tor, shall be subjected to ride quarantine before the Marine Hospital on State-Island (about five miles below the city)
<PB N="30" REF="035335_0029_100231DD861111F0"/>
for a term not exceeding ten, nor more than twenty days." In consequence of which, it was the uniform practice of the Board of Managers to subject all unsuspected vessels to a qua∣rantine of ten days only.</P>
<P>At a meeting of the Board, on the 28th of the same month, it was represented that the health laws had been frequently violated and evaded, by persons landing from vessels under quarantine, and that the resident physician and other officers of the institution, had been obstructed and grossly insulted in the legal exercise of their duties, in open and avowed contempt of the laws, and to the great danger of the health of the city. The board, therefore, "resolved, "That the resident physician, or health-officer of the marine hospital, inform all persons under quarantine, that the 2d Section of the act to alter and amend the health laws, pas∣sed April 4th, 1798, will be strictly enforced, and that no person under quarantine be permitted to land, except in ease of imminent distress, or absolute necessity, agreeably to the said Section." This resolution, together with the sec∣tion alluded to, was published for the benefit of all concer∣ned. The following is a copy, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P>"Sec. 2. And be it further enacted by the authority afore∣said, That every ship or vessel, coming from any foreign port or place, bound to the port of Philadelphia, between the last day of April and the first day of December, in every year, shall come to anchor in the river Delaware, as near to the Marine Hospital as her draft of water and the state of the tide and weather will reasonably admit, before any part of the cargo or baggage be landed, or any person who came in such ship or vessel, shall leave her; and shall submit to the examinations, and obtain the certificate hereafter specified: And if any master, commander, or pilot, shall leave his sta∣tion before the said hospital, or if any master or commander shall permit or suffer any part of the cargo or baggage, or any person or persons arriving in such ship or vessel, from any port beyond the limits of the United States, to be landed on either shore of Delaware Bay or river, before such examina∣tion be duly had, and certificate obtained, the person or per∣sons so permitting, and the person or persons so landing, ex∣cept in case of imminent distress, or absolute necessity, be∣ing thereof convicted upon indictment, under this act, by verdict, confession, or standing mute, in any court having criminal jurisdiction within this commonwealth, shall be sen∣tenced to, and suffer confinement in the gaol of the county
<PB N="31" REF="035335_0030_100231DF12A329F8"/>
of Philadelphia, for any space not less than one, nor more than three years."</P>
<P>The board, likewise, directed the Health-Officer residing at the Marine Hospital, to visit every vessel, riding quaran∣tine, at least once every twenty-four hours, at irregular times, to call the roll of the crew and passengers, and to satisfy him∣self that they were all on board; and, if any others should be found on board, to subject them to remain until the termi∣nation of the period of the vessel's quarantine. But, not∣withstanding these precautions, on the 12th of June, the Board received information that two persons had been on board one of the vessel's then under quarantine; which per∣sons were accordingly prosecuted. The law was also evaded by a mode still more dangerous to the health of the city and its neighbourhood: both persons and goods were landed in the state of Delaware, previous to the vessel's reaching State-Island; which persons, together with their goods, proceeded to the city. Information of this nature was communicated to the Board on the 16th of July; and, on the same day, re∣presentations of another nature, drew, from the Health-Of∣fice, the following advertisement: "Whereas, representations have been made to the Managers of the Marine and City-Hospitals, that frequent communication is had between ci∣tizens of Philadelphia and elsewhere, and persons on board of vessels under quarantine, by means of boats going along side, to the great danger of the health of the city: There∣fore, resolved, that every vessel with which such communica∣tion has been permitted, shall perform an additional quaran∣tine of five days."</P>
<P>There is great reason for supposing that communica∣tions between the city and the vessels under quarantine were carried on to a very great extent. It is said, that persons from these vessels frequently came to the city in the night, and returned again next morning. We are more particular in mentioning these circumstances; for, it is possible that some of the earlier cases of the fever were thus introduced.</P>
<P>About the end of June, a very great influx of foreigners from the West-Indies took place, which created the alarm of government, from a representation, that their views were hos∣tile to the peace of our country; but this proved to be pre∣mature. It was caused by the evacuation of Port-au-Prince by the British troops. Eight vessels arrived at the port of Philadelphia on the 5th of July, from the ports of Cape-Nichola-Mole, Jeremic and Port-au-Prince, bringing two
<PB N="32" REF="035335_0031_100231E4A2B14578"/>
hundred and twenty-seven passengers, and one hundred and sixteen seamen. The sudden death of the Marquis de Rouvray, shortly after his arrival in one of these vessels, gave ground for suspicion, that the seeds of the disease might have been thus early imported.</P>
<P>The period of quarantine, prescribed by law, was general∣ly supposed to be insufficient. The Board of Health, in or∣der to obviate bad consequences from this defect, on the 2d July, procured six of Wynkoop's ventilators; the use of which had been strenuously recommended, in 1797, to the gover∣nor and legislature of Pennsylvania, by the Academy of Me∣dicine, as being admirably adapted for expelling the foul air from the holds of vessels, and preserving the cargo and tim∣bers from putrefaction. These ventilators, the Board direc∣ted the resident physician to use in all vessels that he suspec∣ted might require them.</P>
<P>While the Board of Health were thus employing every means, which they could devise, to prevent a return of the fever by importation, the select and common councils, and many other citizens, were equally vigilant, both by private example and public authority, to guard against its domes∣tic generation. The streets and alleys were kept clean; the police-officers were enjoined to be vigilant in their duty, and the inhabitants cheerfully gave them aid. The following paragraphs, from the newspapers, will convey a more perfect idea how far these precautions were respected, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>

<HEAD>From the Philadelphia Gazette.</HEAD>
<P>The present very warm weather, naturally reminds many citizens of the watering carts, which are deposited in the large wooden-building at the corner of Walnut and Sixth-streets.</P>
<P>There can be no season of the year in which they might be used to greater advantage; and it is the earnest wish, I be∣lieve, of all Philadelphia, that they were immediately ap∣plied to the purposes for which they were made. As to dif∣ficulties, expense, &amp;c. surely these are no objects in a city, which has too often experienced the fatal effects of dry, hea∣ted air.</P>
<P>As the great danger is from a collection of dirt, and con∣sequent putrefaction in our gutters, I would further propose, that the persons appointed to clean the streets, instead of sweeping off the loose, dry dirt, which had much better be left where it is, should be employed in pumping the water
<PB N="33" REF="035335_0032_100231E62FEF9F28"/>
into the gutters, and giving them, at least, a daily cleansing. Besides the public pumps, there are a great number of pri∣vate ones, whose owners would be glad to have them used in this manner, not only for the general good, but for their own sakes; as it is well known nothing contributes more to mending the water, than frequent pumping.</P>

<HEAD>Advice to the inhabitants of Philadelphia and other cities in the United States.</HEAD>
<P>The summer season is the season of fevers, and of those inflammatory diseases which attack man. It is principally large cities that are subject to these misfortunes.</P>
<P>The effervescence of the bile is one of the most com∣mon causes of those diseases in the warm weather. I think it will be rendering humanity service to point out some means of preservation against the destroying pestilence.</P>
<P>One of the general causes of epidemical diseases, is the noxious quality of air, which becomes vitiated by a variety of circumstances to which the magistrates should pay the closest attention:</P>
<P N="1">1. The streets often strewed, for days together, with the putrefying carcases of dead animals, should be cleansed.—These streets should be daily watered, and the gutters swept.</P>
<P N="2">2. A watchful superintendance should take place over several kinds of manufacturies, particularly breweries, sugar∣houses, and others liable to have heaps of fermenting mate∣rials.</P>
<P N="3">3. A severe penalty should be inflicted on keeping pu∣trid substances in the city.</P>
<P>I will mention an instance: A few days ago, several bar∣rels of putrid beef were buried a very few inches under ground, and on the outskirts of the city. Putrid substances should be thrown into the river, at a considerable distance below the city.</P>
<P>It would also be very adviseable to bury the dead, at least during the hot weather, at a distance from the city, and a considerable depth.</P>
<P>A stop put to the abuses I have been speaking of, would certainly contribute to the preservation of the cities of the United States from that dreadful disease, known by the name of the yellow fever.</P>
<P>As a preservation for individuals, I would recommend the use of acids and vomits to those who have the stomach
<PB N="34" REF="035335_0033_100231E8ACE5A318"/>
loaded with bile. The disuse of animal food, and of spiri∣tuous liquors, a vegetable and plain diet; in a word, what∣ever can cool down the heat of the blood and the efferves∣cence of the bile, are recommended.</P>

<HEAD>From Porcupine's Gazette.</HEAD>
<P>It gave me pleasure in observing in this morning's paper that the Select and Common Councils had enjoined and re∣quired the city commissioners to have the streets, lanes, al∣leys and gutters kept free and clear of all noxious matter and filth; but I am sorry they did not see the necessity of paying some attention to the different docks, and having them clea∣ned and kept so; as I am of opinion there is as much danger to be apprehended to the health of the city from the putrid filth and noxious matter that lays, for several hours in the day, exposed to the sun, in many of the docks, and particu∣larly at Market-street, as from any other source. If the com∣missioners were to give themselves the trouble of examining the docks at low water, I am persuaded they would see the necessity of having them cleared, without a request from the councils to do what is their duty, as I am informed the power already lays with them.</P>

<P>In consequence of the extraordinary vigilance of the city commissioners, in junction with the inhabitants, the streets, lanes and alleys, within the city, were never known, in any former period, to be kept cleaner, or in better order. The board of health, the resident and consulting physicians of the port, and the other physicians of the city, were equally watch∣ful and vigilant in their departments.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="035335_0034_100231EB00607F20"/>
On the 2d July, Drs. Wistar and Duffield communicated to the board of health, the death of Mr. Mark Miller (one of the eight cases formerly mentioned,) with the yellow fever, at the house of Mr. Mark Reeve, merchant, Callowhill-street, between Front and Second-streets; whereupon, the board ordered the house in which he died to be clean∣sed and white-washed; his bedding and apparel to be taken to the city-hospital, and buried, for purification; and that Mr. Reeve's family, and those who attended Mr. Miller, be recommended to remove from the city. All this was punctually complied with, and no person was afterwards known to have taken the fever from Mr. Miller. There was not a doubt, among the physicians, respecting the nature of the disease of which Mr. Miller died. Drs. Hodge and Wistar, who attended him, de∣clared it to have been a true case of yellow fever: the black vomit, one of its most sure and violent characteris∣tics, appeared previous to death. This being one of the earliest cases which created alarm, or apprehension in the city, this summer, we shall be particular to ascertain the precise circumstances of the case. Dr. Currie, in his <HI>Me∣moirs of the Yellow Fever of</HI> 1798, states the particulars thus: "June 27th, cool, thermometer only 76° at two P. M. Mark Miller died to-day under the care of Drs. Wis∣tar and Hodge, with symptoms of the yellow fever, at Mrs. Reeves's, in Callowhill-street. He had been much fatigued and debilitated, from loading a vessel at Almond-street wharf, a mile from his lodgings, in the heat of the day, to which he had walked daily for sometime. He had, also, according to the account of Mrs. Reeves, slept on the bed in which her son had died of the fever the preceding autumn." By com∣paring Dr. Currie's statement with our narration, it will appear evident, that he has been misinformed respecting some of the particulars of this case. Mr. Reeve informs us, that last fall, after the fever had so far subsided, that the citi∣zens were returning to the city, a boy in his employ was ta∣ken ill with what was supposed to be the yellow fever. He had a mild attack, and recovered. During his illness, a thick bed-quilt was constantly kept between the bed-linen and the bed, and that, after his recovery, the bed was, according to advice of the physician, laid in an open field amongst the grass, and there suffered to remain for a week or ten days ex∣posed to the cold air and white frost. The bed was afterwards brought home, and, from that period, was in constant use in
<PB N="36" REF="035335_0035_100231ED50B659D0"/>
the family. Mr. Miller slept upon it for many months pre∣vious to his death. On the night of June 5th, Mr. Miller sat up to watch the corpse of Benjamin Jones, taylor, in Fromberger's court. Mr. Jones had been but six or seven weeks resident in Philadelphia. About seven or eight months previous, he had been bit by a dog supposed to be mad. He was delirious and attempted to bite his attendants. These cir∣cumstances produced suspicion that he had the hydrophobia; but his physician, Dr. Physick, who opened his body after death, asserted it to be the yellow fever. Mr. Miller was taken sick on the night of June 20, some days previous to which, he had fatigued himself in shipping some goods at Almond-street wharf, upwards of a mile from his lodgings: to which he walked daily. Whether he caught the infection from Benjamin Jones, whose body had been opened, or from any remaining contagion in the bed, or any other local cause, it will be difficult to determine; the probability is, that he had imbibed the infection from one or the other of these first∣mentioned causes, and that it was excited into action by over∣fatiguing himself in the heat of the day.</P>
<P>It is said that two other persons, who were taken sick af∣ter they went to the country, suppose that they caught the infection from the above-mentioned Mr. Jones. They were attended in the country by Dr. Isaac Huddleston, of Norris∣town. They, however, recovered.</P>
<P>On the evening of the 8th July, the armed ship Deborah, captain Edward Yard, arrived at the fort from Jeremie. By the following answers to the official questions, prescribed by law, it appears that she buried eight persons during her stay there and passage home, and that the harbour of Jeremie was sickly.</P>

<P>On the 16th of July, the Board of Health directed the resident and consulting physicians, to examine the ship De∣borah, and report to them their opinion respecting her con∣dition previous to the expiration of her quarantine, and to cause the bedding and apparel of those who had died, to be landed at the marine hospital for purification; accordingly, on the 17th of the same month, Dr. Samuel Duffield, the consulting physician, and Dr. James Hall, the resident physi∣cian, reported, that they had visited and carefully examined the state of the ship Deborah, captain Yard, from Jeremie; and had found the same remarkably clean, and the people on board, in perfect health: Captain Yard informed them, that he lost three of his people in Hispaniola, and two on his pas∣sage home; the last on the 24th of June, besides three pas∣sengers; one was a lady just from Europe: she died on the 2d of July, of a fever, which terminated in constant purging, but without vomiting, or any uncommon yellowness of the skin. A white child died on the 26th of June, and a Negro child died on the 7th of July. The latter supposed to be occasioned by a wound which it had received on the head, by running against one of the pikes. That the captain was of opinion, that all his people who died, brought on their dis∣eases by intemperance, and by exposing themselves, when in that state, to the rain and night air. That he further declar∣ed to them, that none of the people who died, either of his crew or the passengers, had any thing like black vomiting, extraordinary yellowness of the skin, or, as far as he was a∣ble to judge, with any of the striking symptoms of the yel∣low fever; and that their diseases were not communicated to any other persons from any of those that died. That upon considering the report of captain Yard, and comparing it with the present very healthy appearance of the people on board, none of whom appeared to them to have been affect∣ed by the diseases of those who died, and the number of per∣sons now on board (ninety-five) they were of opinion, that
<PB N="39" REF="035335_0038_100231F7A77D7388"/>
the diseases of which the before-mentioned persons died, were not of a contagious nature: That they were more con∣firmed in this opinion, from the state of the four persons be∣longing to that ship, who were then in the marine hospital, none of whom exhibited any symptoms whatever of a conta∣gious or malignant nature: That they were also of opinion, that the ship was now in a perfect and wholesome state; that the people were free from every appearance of contagion: that the bedding and cloathing of all the persons who died in the vessel, had either been thrown overboard, or landed at the hospital.</P>
<P>In consequence of this report, the Deborah was permitted to proceed to the city; where she arrived on the 18th of Ju∣ly, and discharged her cargo near Race-street wharf.</P>
<P>Many circumstances have occurred to excite strong suspi∣cion that the contagion was imported in the ship Deborah. In consequence of which, we have endeavoured, as far as is in our power, to acquire a just knowledge of the most im∣portant facts relative thereto; and to state them with all possible precision, that the public may be the better enabled to form a correct judgment upon this important question.</P>
<P>The Deborah sailed from Philadelphia in February, 1798, for Cape Nichola-Mole; where she arrived in March; in April she sailed from thence to Port-au-Prince, from Port∣au-Prince to Jeremie, and from thence back to Philadelphia.</P>
<P>These places, which are in the island of Hispaniola or St. Domingo, had long been garrisoned by British troops. In consequence of which, they were more peculiarly adapted to the generation of pestilential diseases.</P>
<P>Dr. Curric was informed by Mr. Lewis, the mate, that previous to the Deborah's taking in her cargo, at Jeremie, she was employed as a transport in the British service. That the yellow fever prevailed in those places to which the Debo∣rah went is ascertained by captain Yard's answer to the official question, No. 11. He also acknowledged <Q>in conversation with a gentleman shortly after his arrival in Philadelphia, that while he lay at Jeremie, a very mortal disease was pre∣valent there, which the natives called the <HI>Maladie de Slam</HI> (a name by which the yellow fever is known in many parts of the West-Indies, particularly the French Islands) of which the captain and the chief part of the crew of an English ship, from Liverpool, died.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Currie's Memoirs, p. 132.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="035335_0039_100231FBD47899C0"/>
The prevalence of the yellow fever in St. Domingo, at that period, is further confirmed by the following letter to Dr. Griffitts, from Dr. Edward Stevens, who was there shortly after; and who is well acquainted with the disease, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>During my residence at Santo-Domingo and the Cape, I received frequent information that the yellow fever prevail∣ed in almost all the sea-port towns in the French part of His∣paniola, particularly at Cape Nichola-Mole. It raged so vio∣lently at this latter place, and the mortality was so great, that it obliged the British to abandon the post sooner than they intended. About the same time this disease made its appearance in the harbour of St. Thomas, and was so des∣tructive to foreigners, that it obtained the name of <HI>the plague</HI> from all those who spoke of it. At Santo Domingo I saw several cases of it, during the months of August and Septem∣ber. These were entirely confined to American seamen, while the native inhabitants of the city were altogether ex∣empt from it. The privateers which frequented this port lost also several of their crew by this fever, while they re∣mained at anchor.</P>
<P>I mentioned to you that a similar disease had broke out on board of the schooner Swift, at Porto-Rico. The follow∣ing are the facts respecting that vessel, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> On the 11th of last March, she sailed from the Delaware, and, after touch∣ing at Tortola and St. Thomas, arrived at the city of Santo Domingo on the 13th of April, where she continued until the 26th of June, when, she went to the Cape, and returned again on the 1st of August, without touching at any other port. She remained at Santo Domingo until the 28th of October, and then sailed for Porto-Rico, where she arrived on the 5th of November. She anchored at the entrance of the harbour, at a considerable distance from any other vessel. A short time before she left the city of Santo Do∣mingo, she took on board, from a French privateer that had been dismantled, a quantity of rigging, sails, guns and am∣munition. From the time that she left Philadelphia until her arrival at Porto-Rico, the crew were healthy, except two of the sailors, who were affected with venereal complaints. The second day after she anchored at this latter port, the mate and one of the sailors began to complain; and the greatest part of the crew, together with the captain, were successive∣ly attacked. The two first died after a short illness, and one
<PB N="41" REF="035335_0040_1001FEA2019F67C0"/>
of the others during her passage to America. The captain escaped, in consequence of being brought on shore and care∣fully attended, at the commencement of the disorder. When she arrived at Porto-Rico, and during her stay there, both the harbour and city were remarkably healthy, and her crew had little or no communication with either the shore or the shipping. These are all the facts which have come to my knowledge respecting the existence of this disease in the West-Indies, during the last summer and fall.</P>

<HEAD>Extract from Dr. Currie's defence of the opinions of the College of Physicians.</HEAD>
<P>To weaken, and, as far as in their power, to invalidate the opinion of the College respecting the origin of the disease in Philadelphia last year, the Academy have brought forward the testimony of several persons in some degree interested in disguising, or at least withholding some part of the truth. These go to prove that the declaration of Alexander Philips, who told Messrs. Towne and Purdon, severally, and at dif∣ferent times, that he had brought sick persons to his house, was false. Mr. Purdon had called on Philips to request pay∣ment of an account he owed him—Philips assured him that he would pay him in a few days, as he had been down the river and brought up an old lodger, whom he had occasion for as a witness, but that he was then sick.</P>
<P>That Philips had a man, belonging to the Deborah, sick in his house, at the time he was sick himself, is certain from the testimony of Dr. Griffitts, who prescribed for him.</P>

<P>There was no instance of the fever being in Kensington until the Deborah went there, nor was it in any case known to be contagious before her arrival. The people belonging to her, labourers who assisted to unload her, carpenters who re∣paired her, and others who visited her, were the first who were attacked with the disease; indeed, a very considerable proportion of the first cases have been traced to this vessel. [<HI>See the recapitulation at the end of this chapter.</HI>]</P>
<P>It is probable that the contagion was imported from the West-Indies in other vessels besides the Deborah. On the 21st of July, the schooner Aurora, with eleven passengers,
<PB N="46" REF="035335_0045_1002321737CC87D8"/>
and fourteen seamen, and the Ariel, with twenty-two passen∣gers, and twelve seamen, arrived at the fort from Cape-Ni∣chola-Mole. <HI>Two</HI> passengers died on board the Aurora, dur∣ing her passage. She was boarded in the bay of Delaware, on the 16th of July, by James Nagglee, pilot. Then it rain∣ed. He got wet, and in that state, he slept upon the deck. He also slept upon the deck on the 19th, exposed to the sun; and on the 22d, he complained of pains in his legs and feet. He was taken to the Marine Hospital, on State-Island, on the 23d, and <HI>died</HI> (July 28th)—the <HI>fifth</HI> day after his admission. Previous to his death, he became delirious, vomited blood, and bled at the nose.</P>
<P>The mate of the Aurora also died at the Marine Hospital. When he was admitted, he had a swelling in his groin, ac∣companied with sores in sundry other parts of his body—par∣ticularly his head; but, upon examination, he denied that it was <HI>lues venera.</HI> When landed, he walked up to the hospital, and did not appear to have a high fever; but, the day after, he was suddenly taken with a convulsion fit, and died deliri∣ous on the <HI>sixth</HI> day after his admission.</P>
<P>The Ariel was boarded by James Roland, pilot, on the 16th of July; he slept in the mate's birth, and was not exposed to the bad weather. He was a very temperate, sober man. On the 25th, he complained of a severe pain in the head, and was sent to the Marine Hospital on the 26th. When admit∣ted, he had a slow fever, and complained of great weakness. He died on the <HI>third</HI> day after his admission. Previous to death, he was affected with the hickup, oppression of the breast, and heavy breathing. He bled once at the mouth, and his skin was yellow.</P>
<P>These circumstances induced the Board of Health, to pro∣long the quarantine of the Aurora and Ariel to twenty days; during which, they were well cleansed, washed with vinegar, white-washed, and had two of Wynkoop's ventilators work∣ing on board. They came to the city on the 10th of August.</P>
<P>On the 19th of July, the brig Mary arrived at the fort from Kingston, Jamaica, with six passengers and twenty-two sea∣men. After ten days quarantine, she came up to the city, (July 29) and began to discharge her cargo, consisting of cof∣fee and cocoa, at Ross and Simpson's wharf, below Wal∣nut-street. Part of the cargo was much damaged, and in a putrid state. Several sudden deaths occurred about this time in the neighbourhood, and the inhabitants were alarmed.
<PB N="47" REF="035335_0046_1002321B14BEE9C0"/>
In consequence, information was lodged at the health-office, purporting that the coffee and cocoa, landed from said brig, and stored at Ross and Simpson's, was in a putrid state, and extremely offensive. Likewise, that a store in the same block of buildings, belonging to Mr. Dawson, contained a quantity of hides, in a putrid and offensive condition. That Mr. Dawson had died that morning of a fever, which had excited great alarm in that neighbourhood, and that his daughter was ill of the same fever. In consequence of this report, the mayor, by request of the board, caused all the coffee to be returned on board the brig; and ordered, that she should be removed from the wharf opposite to the Wind-Mill island; from whence she was, together with all the hands who worked on board, removed to State-island, where the articles were landed for purification, and the vessel carefully cleansed.</P>
<P>The Academy of Medicine, in their communication to the Board of Health, of the 8th of August, say, that they <HI>derive</HI> the rapid progress of the fever, during the first week of Au∣gust, to the foul air of several ships lately arrived in the port, and from the damaged coffee of the above vessel. But, as the disease had made some progress before the arrival of the bring Mary, it could not, therefore, have proceeded from her alone.</P>
<P>The consulting physician, on the 25th of July, intimated to the Board of Health, that two strangers, who had arrived at a tavern in Front-street, were lying sick; and, on the 30th of the same month, Christopher Holmes, from Penn-street, was sent to the Marine hospital; that the house was ordered to be cleansed, and the bedding and apparel removed to the City Hospital for purification. The same day, a report was made to the board, by Mr. James Yard and Dr. Samuel Duffield, stating, that George Ralston, who had laboured on board the Deborah, died that day, after a short illness. A letter from Dr. Hall, the same day, mentioned the death of a person, who was taken to the Marine Hospital from the ship Nestor.</P>
<P>The number of deaths and new cases of the fever, which daily increased from the 28th of July to the 6th of August, alarmed the citizens, and became a general topic of conver∣sation. The college of Physicians met on the sixth of Au¦gust: at which time about 26 cases of the fever were known to exist in the city. After conferring together, they unani∣mously agreed to the following resolutions; which were im∣mediately communicated to the Board of Health:</P>
<Q><PB N="48" REF="035335_0047_1002321CA2BDC898"/>
<P>Resolved, That the College inform the Board of Health, that a malignant contagious fever has made its appearance in Water-street, between Walnut and Spruce-streets, and in the vicinity thereof: and</P>
<P>That the College recommend to the Board of Health to procure the removal of all the families that are situated be∣tween Walnut and Spruce-streets, and the east side of Front street and the river; and to have all the shipping, lying be∣tween Walnut and Spruce-streets removed to a proper dis∣tance from the city.</P></Q>
<P>In consequence of this communication from the College, the Board of Health met, and on the 7th, they published the following recommendation, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>

<P>Whereas, the Board of Managers of the Marine and City Hospitals of the port and city of Philadelphia, having received information from the College of Physicians, "that a malig∣nant contagious fever has made its appearance in Water-street, between Walnut and Spruce-streets, and in the vicinity thereof;"—and the reports of Dr. Samuel Duffield and Dr. Parke, appointed particularly to examine that part of the city, specifying the particular cases found therein—Therefore, resolved, that in order to prevent, as much as possible, all com∣munication with that part of the city, that the health-officer cause the vessels now lying at the wharves between Tun-alley and Jesse and Robert Waln's wharf, including the said wharf, to be removed, and that no vessel of any description what∣ever be suffered to come to the said wharves until the further order of the board.</P>
<P>The board also earnestly recommend to the inhabitants of that part of the city, included between Walnut and Spruce-streets, and the east side of Front-street and the river, and also those immediately in the vicinity thereof, to remove without the bounds of the city and Liberties as speedily as possible.</P>

<P>The vessels were accordingly removed from the wharves above specified. But, instead of being "removed to a pro∣per distance from the city," as recommended by the College, they were distributed to the other wharves. Most of them
<PB N="49" REF="035335_0048_10023221FAFABD58"/>
were sent to the upper parts of the city. The brig Mary, who brought the damaged coffee, &amp;c. was the only vessel which was removed from the city. Perhaps from this cause it was, that the disease, soon afterwards, so rapidly spread, and produced such a general depopulation. Another circum∣stance which may have aided its spreading, ought not to pass unnoticed: a quantity of the damaged coffee, before mention∣ed, was scattered on the wharf, which the itinerant poor un∣fortunately gathered up; and thus, probably, carried home the instrument of their destruction!</P>
<P>The removal of the inhabitants, from the city, was earnest∣ly recommended in the daily papers; nor was any time lost in communicating the cause for alarm. The following com∣munication, recommending provision for the removal of the poor, is extracted from <HI>Porcupine's Gazette,</HI> of August 7th, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P>The yellow fever is in this city. It is now come out, that it made its appearance about a week ago. Several per∣sons are dead with it, and, according to all the accounts I have heard, it spreads with greater rapidity than it did last year.</P>
<P>A number of stories, with regard to its origin, are, as usual, on foot; but, I believe, the best way would be to lay aside all vain disputes on this subject, and prepare, as quick as possible, to make provision for removing those who have not the means of removing themselves, to situations more healthy.</P>
<P>The Philadelphia Gazette, on the same day, contained the following</P>
<P><HI>Communication</HI>—An immediate attention to the advice of the board of health, in evacuating the infected quarter is, perhaps, the only measure by which our unfortunate city can be rescued from increasing affliction. Individual interest should yield to a temporary sacrifice, in order to avert the public calamity. It is a duty every citizen owes to the com∣munity, as well as to himself, to be vigilant in removing the objects, and thereby impeding the progress of contagion.</P>
<P>To those who necessarily remain in the city, it is almost superfluous to intimate the necessity of avoiding those parts where the contagion prevails. A sentiment of self-preserva∣tion, if not of duty to society, will be a sufficient restraint.—Under the favor of heaven, and our own precaution, we may then hope to be soon restored to health, prosperity, and hap∣piness.</P>

The Academy of Medicine met on the 8th of August, to communicate their sentiments to the Board of Health: they presented the following document, which was published for the information of the public, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>

<DIV1 TYPE="recommendation">
<P>THE Academy of Medicine of Philadelphia, having taken into consideration the existence of a malignant bilious fe∣ver in this city, have conceived it to be their duty to lay before the managers of the Marine and City Hospitals, the following facts respecting its origin, and the means of checking its pro∣gress.</P>
<P>We have, upon inquiry, discovered that a case of this fever existed in the city on the 6th of June, and that several cases of it existed in July, in parts of the city remote from the river, and wholly unconnected with each other. They ap∣peared to originate from the putrid exhalations of alleys and gutters, and docks, and from the stagnating water in the neighbourhood of the city. We derive the late rapid increase of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ever from the foul air of several ships lately arrived in the port, and from some damaged coffee which arrived in a brig from Jamaica on the 29th of July. In the course of our inquiries into the origin of the fever, we did not meet with a single fact that could support the opinion of contagion be∣ing imported in the bodies or clothes of sick people in the ships or vessels which lie between Walnut and Spruce streets, where the disease has prevailed most. Many respect∣able modern authorities assert that the yellow fever is <HI>not con∣tagious</HI> in the West-Indies, and repeated observations satisfy us, that it is rarely so during the <HI>warm weather</HI> in the United States. None of the cases we have as yet seen, have propa∣gated it, and we conceive it to be an error as absurd, in its nature, as it has been fatal in its operation upon the city of Philadelphia, that the contagion of a disease should adhere to the timber of a ship after a sea voyage, and should spread from the timber of the ship without contact through an extensive neighbourhood, and cease to communicate itself afterwards by long and close connection of the sick with their families and attendants. We lament that this fact, together with many others upon the nature and origin of the yellow fever, which were stated in our letter to the Governor, on the 1st of December, 1797, and by him laid before the legislature of the state, have been treated with total neglect in the present health law: the distress we felt upon seeing that law is, how∣ever, much alleviated by the reflection, that we have not con∣tributed,
<PB N="51" REF="035335_0050_1002322A86F2D6D0"/>
in any degree, by supporting an erroneous opinion, to reproduce the present alarming calamity of our city.</P>
<P>We beg leave to recommend for the purpose of check∣ing the progress of the fever, an attention to the following directions:</P>
<P N="1">1st. The removal of all the families from those parts of the city where the disease, from the contamination of the at∣mosphere, appears chiefly to exist, and the preventing those parts being visited by the citizens.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. The removal of all ships and putrid articles of commerce from the wharves and stores of the city.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. The cleaning of the docks, wharves, yards and cellars; also the washing of the gutters every day, and of the streets and alleys three times a week, by means of pumps and fire engines.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. The appointment of a sufficient number of phy∣sicians to take care of such of the poor as may be affected with the fever.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. Publicly to advise the citizens to avoid all the usual exciting causes of fever, such as intemperance, fatigue, excessive heat, the night air, all violent and debilitating pas∣sions of the mind.</P>
<P N="6">6thly. To advise them, in every case of indisposition, however slight in appearance, to apply immediately for me∣dical aid.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The disease increases—City deserted—Arrangements for the re∣moval of the sick to the City Hospital—Burial of the dead—Care of the sick poor in the City—Want of success at the City Hospital—Removal of the poor to tents—Prospect of the City at the crisis of the disease—Decline of the disease, &amp;c.—State of the City from the commencement to the decline of the cala∣mity.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>ABOUT the beginning of August, the news-papers an∣nounced the uncommon healthiness of the city; a circum∣stance which has occurred towards the beginning of that pesti∣lence in almost every city of the United States, where it has appeared. It was the case with Philadelphia, New-York, and Baltimore, in 1797; and with Philadelphia, Beston, New-York, and some other towns, this year. Even, on the first ap∣pearance of the disease, we have been congratulated for the uncommon health of the city. Declarations of uncommon health, at this season, will, perhaps, hereafter, be looked upon as an omen of disease.</P>
<P>The publications of the College of Physicians, the Board of Health, and the Academy of Medicine, on the sixth, se∣venth, and eighth days of August, produced the most serious alarm amongst all classes of citizens. Numbers fled, and crouded into the surrounding towns and country, to the dis∣tance of twenty, thirty, and even fifty miles from the city, to provide refuge for their families and friends. The removals from the city were much more general and more rapid than in 1793. It is probable, that at least twice, if not three times the number of persons fled this year, as at any former period. Many who had been witnesses to the distresses of 1793 and 1797, and appeared then the most undaunted, were now the first to remove from danger. For the first three weeks after the alarm, the streets were crouded with waggons and carts, loaded with goods and furniture. Forty or fifty wag∣gons, besides carts, have been seen in their route to the coun∣try,
<PB N="55" REF="035335_0054_10023239D52AFDB8"/>
in one direction. One square, in the centre of the city, where, in 1793, there removed only about twenty-five persons, in 1798, there were above one hundred and forty. The dispersion began about the sixth and eighth of August, and, altho' most numerous in the two succeeding weeks, they continued partially until the middle of September. Many, who at the beginning, when the disease was confined to parti∣cular parts of the city, had adopted the resolution of staying, and confining themselves to their houses, were afterwards in∣duced to remove; because, the disease approached either their doors or neighbourhood. The number who fled from the city have been estimated at <HI>three-fourths</HI> to <HI>five-sixths</HI> of the whole inhabitants: the total number of inhabitants have been esti∣mated at fifty to seventy thousand. We have estimated them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 8.</NOTE> at fifty-five to sixty thousand; and we think it probable, that about forty thousand may have removed from the city.</P>
<P>In 1793, our citizens complained of inhospitality in the country, arising principally from the terror created by the novelty of the disorder. Then it was believed to be as contagi∣ous in the country as in the unfortunate city, which poured forth its fugitives in every direction. It was not, therefore, to be wondered, that our citizens were shunned, as if even their approach carried inevitable destruction. To repel supposed dangers, guards were stationed, with arms, to stop the flight of the wanderers. They were then refused the neces∣saries of life; and, in many instances, they died for want. Many could not always procure a comfortable lodging. The case was rather different this year. An idea, now prevailed, grounded upon the experience of 1793 and 1797, that the disorder was not communicable in the country; in conse∣quence of which, there was less difficulty made to the recep∣tion of our citizens. Throughout the country, the houses were generally open for them: accommodations were fur∣nished at reasonable rates: the extortions practised were few. There were some however, signalized by avarice.</P>
<P>Altho' accommodations were generally afforded reason∣able still the sufferings of our citizens were very consider∣able. Many persons, accustomed to spacious houses, and all the comforts and luxuries which Philadelphia could furnish, were obliged to content themselves with, perhaps, one small room, wherein two, three or four beds were crouded together; be∣sides this, in some situations remote from markets, the fare
<PB N="56" REF="035335_0055_1002323CE87427C8"/>
was very coarse; and, in some places, not abundant. Instan∣ces have occurred, of women, in a state of parturition, in bleak, desolate rooms, almost without assistance.</P>
<P>The Health Office was removed from Walnut street to the City Hall, where it was kept open, night and day. The City-Tavern was shut up, and the different public offices, banks, &amp;c. were removed, either to the remoter parts of the city, to Germantown, Trenton, Chester, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Meantime, the disease continued to increase, and appeared in parts of the city, remote from where it first was discover∣ed. The number of deaths in the city and suburbs was col∣lected for the newspapers, and published daily. The returns of the City-Hospital were also regularly reported; and, after the 15th of August, a daily report of the new cases was pub∣lished, collected from the different physicians, by Mr. JOHN JARVIS, who was employed by the Board of Health for that purpose. These reports were a index by which the citizens were enabled, with some degree of certainty, to judge of its progress, extension and decline. The arrangements of the Board of Health, for the removal of the sick, interment of the dead, &amp;c. were judicious and early. They empowered all the regular practising physicians to grant orders for ad∣mission into the City Hospital, and coachees were provided by the Board for that purpose.—At the Hospital burying-ground, graves were always ready: the grave diggers re∣mained day and night in the yard.—When a person died, it was only necessary to make application at the Health-Office, where hearses and coffins were in readiness to convey the corpse to the grave. The patients in the City-Hospital were placed under the management of Dr. Philip Syng Physick, and Dr. Samuel Cooper. They resided there constantly, and were furnished with two assistants;—a competant number of nurses and attendants, with medicine, and every thing ne∣cessary for the comfort and relief of the sick;—nor were the poor, who were sick in the city, neglected: skilful physi∣cians were appointed to attend them, and medicines provid∣ed for their use, at the expense of the public. The north part of the city, and the Northern-Liberties, were placed under the care of Dr. Francis Bowes Sayre, Dr. James Mease, and Dr. Kinlaid: Southwark, and the south part of the city, were attended by Dr. John Church and Dr. Benjamin Duffield; and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>or of the city were attended by Dr. Samuel Duf∣field:</P>
<P>In the early period of the calamity, the disease assumed a
<PB N="57" REF="035335_0056_1002324013F16478"/>
more malignant form, than it did in '93 or '97, and very great mortality took place: not <HI>one</HI> in <HI>six</HI> cases now reco∣vered. Several of the physicians announced their intention of leaving the city—perhaps, urged by the recollection of the great mortality among physicians the year previous.—An idea that it was the plague, and incurable, was generally propagated and believed: Nurses were with difficulty procu∣red, perhaps from the experience of '97, which proved, that the native blacks were not more exempt from the disease than the whites.—An almost universal antipathy to the City Hos∣pital prevailed. The terror of being forceably sent there, pre∣vented many from acknowledging their sickness, until they were unable to conceal it; and scarcely <HI>one</HI> patient in <HI>ten</HI> would acknowledge that his disease was the prevailing fever. This operated in producing a delay in calling for medical assistance, until that period, when it was difficult to overcome it by the power of medicine. A want of confidence likewise prevented many from applying to a physician for advice. They were convinced, from experience, that in jarring opinions, humanity is often lost sight of, by an obstinate ad∣herence to error: in the former years, the medical pen was, in many instances, dipped in gall. "The several combatants took their peculiar grounds, and disdained, in too many cases, to save the life of a human being, by following any other suggestions than their own. They distracted the public mind, and shook all confidence in medical assistance."</P>
<P>But, the reverse of this was exhibited this season; and it was truly agreeable, to observe the harmony that prevailed among the physicians in this period of sickness and distress. They all agreed in advising their friends to leave the city; altho' they "<HI>derived</HI>" the disease from different causes. The practise of the one, therefore, became more assimilated to that of the other.</P>
<P>The Board of Health, impressed with a sense of the con∣sequences of delaying to apply for medical aid, on the 13th of August, published the following recommendation:</P>

<PB N="58" REF="035335_0057_10023242B30E30C0"/>
may be assured, that every possible comfort and accommo∣dation will be afforded.—The public are informed, that the care of the patients, and management of the City-Hospital, is committed to Doctor Physick and Doctor Cooper, who reside constantly there, and whose professional eminence, it is presumed, will ensure a just confidence.</P>
<P>An apothecary also resides at the Hospital, with an am∣ple store of the best medicines.</P>
<P>The Board consider this recommendation as of the high∣est importance, and entreat the attention of their fellow-citi∣zens.</P>

<P>The malignity of the prevailing fever, and its insidious approaches, are such, as to resist the power of medicine, un∣less application is made in the first instance of complaint.—The Board lament that their recommendation has not been attended to; as, in most instances, the patients have been ill three or four days previous to application for medical aid; to which, in a great degree, is to be attributed, the deaths of many valuable members of society. The Board reiterate their call to their fellow-citizens, and earnestly request, that not a moment may be delayed in obtaining medical assistance.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR DOCTOR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Our want of success in treating the prevailing disease, makes us anxious to hear from you, in hopes you may have added some new and useful remedy to those heretofore in use. It is true, all our patients have been sick, at least two, and some of them nine days previously to their admission. Is there any mode of relieving these unfortunate people, which you can suppose we are unacquainted with? We recollect your

<HEAD>THE ANSWER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear and worthy Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am sorry to discover, by your letter, your want of suc∣cess in the treatment of our malignant fever, at the City Hospital. I do not wonder at it: you seldom see the disease in is first stage; and, when you do, you meet it in an aggra∣vated state, by the motion your patients undergo in being con∣veyed to the Hospital.</P>
<P>In answer to your request, I have sat down to inform you of the practice which I have adopted in our present epidemic. In the treatment of the yellow fever of last year, I have oc∣casionally lamented the loss of patients after reducing the pulse by bleeding, and by the liberal use of purging medi∣cines. I have suspected that death occurred in those cases, from the stagnation of acrid bile in the gall-bladder, or its close adherence to the upper bowels, in the manner described by Dr. Mitchell, in his account of the yellow fever-in Vir∣gina, in the year 1741. The slow pulse which occurs about the 4th day, I suspect further to be the effect of this bile. Its effects in a much less morbid state in the jaundice, in reduc∣ing the pulse, is well known. Mr. John Hunter says, he once met with an instance in which it fell to thirty-two strokes in a minute in that disease. Revolving these facts in my mind, I resolved to try to remove this bile, by exciting an <HI>artificial cholera morbus,</HI> about the 4th day of the fever. I was the more disposed to attempt this method of cure, from believing, as I have done for several years, that a Cholera Morbus is no∣thing but the first grade of billious fever thrown in upon the bowels, just as the Dysentery and Diarrhoea are the internal forms of a common billious or intermitting fever.</P>
<P>I began this mode of treating the fever eights day ago. My solicitude for the issue of it was very great. Thank God, it has succeded to my wishes; and thereby lessoned, in a great degree, the anxiety and distress which accompany our at∣tendance upon this ferocious disease. The medicines I use for <HI>shaking</HI> the gall-bladder and bowels, and <HI>discharging</HI> the
<PB N="60" REF="035335_0059_10023249D2D14E78"/>
contents are, tartar-emetic, gamboge, jalap and calomel, combined, or given separately, and in small or large doses, according to circumstances. Perhaps Turpeth mineral might be added to this list of vomiting and purging medicines with advantage. In one case, I gave four grains of tartar-emetic, and twenty of calomel. It operated freely upwards and down∣wards, and brought away a large quantity of green and black bile, but without exciting the least cramp or pain in the stomach or bowels. At the time I gave it, death appeared to be creeping upon the patient. The next day he was out of danger. The person thus rescued from the grave, was the son of Mr. Richard Renshaw. Indeed, I have not, as yet, lost a sing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e patient to whom I have given this powerful remedy. In one instance I fear it will fail. It is in a boy of sixteen years of age, to whom I have given near thirty grains of tar∣tar-emetic in the course of a few hours, without producing the least evacuation from his stomach or bowels. I have ob∣served the same increase of strength after its operation, that we observe after bleeding and purging in the beginning of the fever.</P>
<P>Vomits are old remedies in the yellow fever of the West-Indies. I gave them on the first day of the disease in the year 1793, and always without success. They uniformly did harm, when given in the beginning of the fever, in its worst grade, in 1797. The reason of this failure in their efficacy, I now perceive was, because they were given before the violent morbid action in the system was reduced or moderated by bleeding and purging. After this change is induced in the disease, they are perfectly safe. The time for exhibiting them should be regulated by the pulse, and other symptoms. In moderate cases of the fever, they are as proper in its first stage, as on the fourth day. As there is a blistering point in all fevers, so there appears to be an <HI>emetic point</HI> in the yellow fever. It may occur on the second, and it may be protracted to the sixth or seventh day of the disease. I have not given the medicine I have mentioned in any case where the patient com∣plained of pain or burning in the stomach; but, I have con∣sidered a nausea, and a moderate degree of puking, as no ob∣stacle to its use; for, Dr. Physick has taught me by his dissec∣tions, that these symptoms may exist without the least infla∣mation in the stomach, and that they have been absent where the stomach has appeared after death to have been highly in∣flamed.</P>
<P>The cure of the fever should not rest upon a single dose of
<PB N="61" REF="035335_0060_1002324DF73DF3D8"/>
the medicine. I have given two doses of it in a day in several cases, and have given it in one case, every day for three suc∣cessive days.</P>
<P>It has often been remarked, that no two epidemics are ex∣actly alike. They vary not only in different climates, but in the same climate in different years. They even vary with the changes of the weather in the same season. The fever of 1797 differed in several particulars from the fever of 1793, and the present epidemic differs materially from both. In many of the cases I have seen, it exceeds the fever of last year in its ma∣lignity. These variations in diseases call for corresponding changes in our practice.</P>
<P>I have communicated an account of the <HI>time</HI> and <HI>man</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> discharging the contents of the gall-bladder and bowels to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣veral of our brethren. I ardently hope it may be universally successful in their hands!</P>
<P>If any thing new occurs in your practice in the Hospital, do me the favor of informing me of it.</P>
<P>With best wishes for your health and success in your pre∣sent arduous situation, I am your sincere friend,</P>

<P>The following remarks, attempting to prove that the disease is contagious, is taken from the Philadelphia Gazette:</P>
<P>"The present alarming situation of our city, is, alas! tru∣ly deplorable—almost in a general state of infection with a disease, to whose virulence, medicinal skill is lamentably com∣pelled to acknowledge its inferiority! Former experience is rendered, in a great measure, useless, by the very material dif∣ference in the nature of the disease.—The most copious bleed∣ing, and the most violent purgatives have been found ineffec∣tual; and the success that will attend the new system of emp∣tying the gall-bladder, is, at least, problematical. With regard to the opinion of the non-contagion of the disorder, I have very great reason to doubt it. I have known, lately, several in∣stances, that could not be accounted for upon any other prin∣ciple than that of contagion. The most striking of the cases I allude to, is, where several of a family, living in a healthy and uninfected part of the city, took the disorder from a per∣son in the family, whom they had for several days closely at∣tended; without having themselves been in any part of the city that could even have been supposed to be infected. I
<PB N="62" REF="035335_0061_1001FEAA448BE8F0"/>
would caution my fellow-citizens not to trust too implicitly to this fatal opinion, which has been so industriously propagated. A confidence in it, in case it should happen to be erroneous, may prove the destruction of thousands, while, by acting un∣der a disbelief of it, and using every possible precaution, many lives may be preserved. It is at least doubtful whether it is, or is not, contagious; and there being a doubt, I think the wi∣sest course to be pursued is obvious: I would advise my friends, to avoid, as much as possible, exposing themselves to the night air, or morning fogs; nothing tending more effectually to predispose the body to infection."</P>
<P>Many persons who had gone into the country for safety, were afterwards seized with the fever. It is more than proba∣ble that they had imbibed the contagion before they left the city. In consequence, the Board of Health, on the 22d of Au∣gust, authorised the physicians to receive into the Hospital, all such persons as came from the country. There were now about fifty patients in the Hospital: the new cases amounted to about forty, and the deaths, to above thirty, per day.—The difficulty of procuring nurses to attend the sick, induced the Board of Health, to solicit such persons, of good character, as were willing and qualified for that office, to leave their ad∣dress at the Health Office; where citizens, who required them, were invited to apply.</P>
<P>The sufferings of the poor, and, indeed of many others in middling circumstances of life, were extreme: deprived, as they were, of all employment, and unable to procure money from those who owed them;—a stagnation to trade and other causes, rendered them incapable of removing their families to the country; and many of them were almost, literally, starving: even the resources of credit were not left; as there were very few stores open, or bakers who remained in town. In this crisis, the Guardians of the Poor liberally stepped for∣ward; and, in junction with the Board of Health, erected tents on the east bank of the river Schuylkill; to which they invited the citizens to remove with their families. There were also tents afterwards erected at Masters' Place, for the same laudable purpose; and provision was made for the relief of the poor in the city, whose situations prevented them from removing.</P>

<SALUTE>Fellow Citizens,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Impelled by the awful progress and unparalleled malignity of the prevailing fever, we are constrained to address your feelings, as well as your reason, in order to avert the fatal des∣truction, which, with rapid strides, is pervading our ill-fated city and suburbs.</P>
<P>The best skill of our physicians, and all the powers of me∣dicine, it must be acknowledged, have proved unequal in the contest with this devouring poison.</P>
<P>With the most affecting sympathy, and anxious solicitude, we have, to the best of our judgments, endeavoured to em∣ploy, as circumstances appeared to require, the power and the means entrusted to us, in arresting its progress, and alleviat∣ing its concomitant miseries. We shall continue to employ them with unremitting zeal; but, we have neither the power nor the means to accomplish ALL THE MEASURES necessary to check its extension, or provide for the pressing exigencies of
<PB N="64" REF="035335_0063_100232576471F4C0"/>
the moment. The powers delegated, and appropriations made by law, to the institutions under our direction, are impotent, indeed, when compared to the magnitude of the occasion.</P>
<P>It remains for our fellow-citizens to attain, by their energy, the ends, which, alone, can stop its progress and diminish its horrors.</P>
<P>We have, in conjunction with the Guardians of the Poor, caused tents to be erected on the east bank of the Schuylkill, for the accommodation of the indigent; where near twelve hundred are already provided for, out of the fund appropria∣ted for the ordinary relief of the poor. This is but a partial mitigation of the evils which <HI>environ</HI> thousands who have a claim upon the philanthropy of those who are in more for∣tunate circumstances.</P>
<P>The difficulty of procuring a place of refuge, at present, in the country, is too well known; and the expense attending the removal of a family, has discouraged many from the attempt, who are in circumstances to live comfortably at home.</P>
<P>What remains to be done? Citizens of respectability and influence!—come forward, and form yourselves into a com∣mittee for the purpose of erecting, on the west bank of the Schuylkill, all the tents that can be collected: let the tents be floored with boards, and made as comfortable as possible.—If tents cannot be had, boards, in abundance, may be procured for the erection of sheds. Admonish those citizens who have no place of refuge, to take shelter there,—particularly those from the east part of the city, the district of Southwark, and the Northern Liberties.—In short, ALL who can leave their homes, without manifest injury;—except those who are ne∣cessary for the protection of the city and liberties.</P>
<P>The committee should have the general superintendance and regulation of the tents, and authority to preserve order; contract for certain supplies of bread, meat, vegetables, wood, &amp;c. at the lowest possible rates. Those who are not in cir∣cumstances to pay, must be supplied by public bounty.</P>
<P>It is at least an unequal, perhaps an unjust mode of raising money by an appeal to the humanity of generous individuals; but, if on any occasion, it may be justified, the present may be assumed without hesitation.</P>
<P>We call your attention to the actual and undisguised state of our city. Consider the mortality and rapid increase of the sick at so early a period.—View the list of your physicians, and <HI>mark how few are at their posts;</HI> and we believe you will think, with us, that the preservation of health is only to be at∣tained by flight.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="035335_0064_1002325A8218B288"/>
Do not flatter yourselves, fellow-citizens, that this picture is too highly coloured: we speak from conviction, and a knowledge of facts; and doubt not, but that the lives of hun∣dreds, perhaps of thousands, may be preserved, by the adop∣tion of these or similar measures.</P>

<P>Much merit is due to the framer of this elegant, feeling, and pathetic address, which, in a very ample manner, pro∣duced the contemplated relief. The Board of Health were, however, aware, that it could not produce the immediate supply which their exigencies presently required. To obvi∣ate which, they requested their committee, which was ap∣pointed to act in junction with a committee of the Guar∣dians of the Poor, for the purpose of raising means for the relief and assistance of persons desirous of removing from the City and Liberties, to procure, if possible, the necessary aid. They accordingly met, and agreed to the following resolutions:</P>

<P>That the committee be authorised to borrow of any of the Banks, such sum, not exceeding the sum now agreed to be raised, as it may be necessary to advance for the purposes of these resolutions.</P>
<P>That the committee shall appoint one of their number treasurer, to whom each member shall, from time to time, pay over his collections; and the treasurer shall, on receipt there∣of, deposit the same in the Bank of Pennsylvania, in an ac∣count to be opened for that purpose, and subject to the drafts of the Managers of the Marine and City Hospitals,

<P>The prospect which the city now afforded was truly deplo∣rable. Accounts, from almost every quarter east of Seventh-street, furnished the most gloomy pictures of disease and death. The City Hospital contained about 100 sick persons, and the daily admissions amounted to about 22. One hun∣dred and seven new cases, and sixty-seven deaths, per day, had been reported<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See table, at the end of this chapter.</NOTE>—and to add, if possible, to the general dis∣tress, the sons of rapine and robbery were availing themselves of the unguarded state of the city, to enhance themselves by their ignominious plunder. On the night of the 2d of Sep∣tember, the bank of Pennsylvania was opened, and robbed to the amount of <HI>one hundred and sixty-two thousand eight hundred and twenty-one dollars and sixty one cents,</HI> in cash and notes, the particulars of which we will hereafter relate. Every thing seemed to portray ruin and desolation: even the persons em∣ployed to drive the hearses and coachees, for the conveyance of the sick, by their bad behaviour, were aiding the mass of per∣plexity. In consequence of which, the Board of Health were induced to advertise for sober and well-recommended persons to fill this office.</P>

<HEAD>MEDICAL ADVICE TO THE CITIZENS OF PHILADELPHIA.</HEAD>
<P>The following directions for the prevention and treatment of the prevailing fever, are affectionately recommended to those citi∣zens of Philadelphia, who are unable to procure the regular at∣tendance and advice of physicians, by BENJAMIN RUSH, SAMUEL P. GRIFFITTS. <DATE>September 3d, 1798.</DATE></P>
<P>THE seeds of the disease may exist in the body, for a con∣siderable time, without doing any harm. It is generally ex∣cited by one or more of the following causes, which of course,
<PB N="68" REF="035335_0067_1002326672F83F90"/>
ought to be carefully avoided, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> fatigue, a long walk, standing in the sun, or in a current of air, intemperance in eating and drinking, costiveness, violent passions, or sudden emotions of the mind, thin dressed, light bed clothes, and, above all, the night air.</P>
<P>It is of consequence for our citizens to know, that we have but one fever in our city at present, and that every febrile indisposition partakes of the prevailing malignant epidemic. Hundreds have died from mistaking the first stage of the fe∣ver for a common cold. The mistake is a natural one; for, it comes on like a cold, and is frequently excited by cool, or cold air. This remark is intended to produce applications for medical aid as soon as possible after feeling the least symp∣tom of indisposition at the present juncture.</P>
<P>In the forming state of the fever, when the patient feels slightly indisposed, and before he is confined to his bed, the following remedies generally check the disease:</P>
<P>A purge of salts, castor oil, or a dose of jalap and calomel. If these fail of giving relief, a gentle sweat should be excited in the usual way. If there be much pain in the head or back, and the pulse be full, or tense, ten or twelve ounces of blood should be lost, before the use of the sweat, and either before or after taking the purge. Entire rest from business and ex∣ercise of all kinds will be necessary to give efficacy to the above remedies.</P>
<P>If the existence of the disease were more early, and more generally admitted, and the remedies which have been re∣commended, used before the fever was completely formed, there are the strongest reasons to believe there would be much less mortality from it.</P>
<P>After the disease is formed, and appears with more or less of the following symptoms, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> chills, great heat, head-ache, a redness in the eyes, sickness at the stomach, vomiting, pains in the back, limbs and bowels, &amp;c. the following remedies are proper.</P>
<P N="1">1. The loss of ten or twelve ounces of blood, two or three times a-day, while the pulse continues to be full, or tense. If the pulse should be slower, and apparently weaker than natu∣ral, it calls for bleeding as much as it does when it discovers preternatural fulness and tension.</P>
<P N="2">2. The bowels should be purged, at the same time, with ca∣lomel mixed with jalap or rhubarb, in powders or in pills.—The operation of this purging medicine should be aided, when practicable, by clysters, composed of half an ounce of
<PB N="69" REF="035335_0068_1001FEADD012FD80"/>
glauber salts, dissolved in half a pint of warm water, or of half a pint of warm water with sweet oil, molasses, and common salt, of each a table-spoonful, in it.</P>
<P>The bowels should be kept gently open through the whole course of the disease, by means of the above clysters, and any other gently purging medicine.</P>
<P N="3">3. If the stomach should be sick and oppressed with bile, a vomit of ipecacuana, or tartar emetic may be given at any time on the 3d or 4th day of the disease, provided the pulse has been reduced by previous bleeding and purging. From five to ten drops of laudanum may be given to compose the stomach if the vomit should operate more than three or four times.</P>
<P N="4">4. Calomel should be given from the beginning, in doses of from two to five grains, every two hours, in order to ex∣cite a salivation. If the calomel should purge more than two or three times a-day, four or five drops of laudanum may be given two or three times a-day, in order to confine the calomel to the bowels, and thereby to determine it to the mouth and throat. We have seen no death where this me∣dicine has produced a salivation.</P>
<P N="5">5. After the pulse is reduced by bleeding and purging, if the disease has not yielded, a profuse sweat should be excited by wrapping the patient up in blankets, with five or six hot bricks wetted with vinegar applied to different parts of his body, and giving him at the same time large and repeated draughts, of hot camomile or sage tea, hot lemonade or weak punch, or any other hot liquor that is agreeable to him, to drink. This sweat should be continued <HI>but</HI> FOUR or FIVE hours at a TIME, and but ONCE in the twenty-four hours. If the patient should become fainty, during the use of this excellent remedy, it should be discontinued for a few hours, but renewed (under the circumstances above mentioned) if the disease should continue.</P>
<P N="6">6. Blisters should be applied to the wrists and ankles, in common cases, about the third or fourth day of the fever, if the pulse be reduced, or the sickness at stomach is trouble∣some. If the head be much affected, a blister should be ap∣plied to the neck or to the crown of the head, first cutting off the hair and shaving it, and if the stomach should be much affected after the third or fourth day a large blister should be applied to it.</P>
<P N="7">7. In case of delirium with a languid pulse, poultices of raw garlic, with a little mustard, should be applied to the feet,</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="70" REF="035335_0069_10023268C6B75858"/>
8. Fresh air should be admitted into sick rooms at all times, and cool air in the beginning of the fever, when the skin is hot, and the pulse full and tense. In this state of the fever, the hands, feet and face should be washed, ten or twelve times a-day, with cold water. In a cool state of the skin, or when the body is covered with sweat, cool air and cold water are improper.</P>
<P N="9">9. The body and bed linen of the sick should be frequent∣ly changed, and all offensive matters, discharged from them, should be instantly removed.</P>
<P>In cases of great weakness, the patient should not be per∣mitted to rise from his bed when under the operation of purg∣ing physic, nor upon any other occasion.</P>
<P N="10">10. The drinks of sick people, in the beginning of the fe∣ver, should be toast and water, tamarind water, lemonade, currant jelly, dissolved in water, apple water or barley water. In the latter stage of the fever, the drinks may be porter and water, claret and water, milk and water, or camomile tea.</P>
<P>Weak tea and coffee may be taken in the beginning of the fever. In its second stage, the patient may eat bread and milk, with roasted apples, or soft peaches, chocolate, sago, ta∣pioca, ripe fruits, weak chicken or veal broth, and a little boiled chicken.</P>
<P>It will be improper to depend exclusively upon any one of the above remedies. The combined force of them, all is barely sufficient, in many cases, to overcome this formidable disease.</P>

<HEAD>DIRECTIONS</HEAD>
<P><HI>How to escape the Yellow-Fever, now prevalent in Philadelphia:</HI> Addressed particularly to those citizens whose circumstances will not permit them to comply with the recommenda∣tions of the Managers of the Marine and City Hospitals.</P>
<P>The fever, which at this time prevails in our unfortunate city and suburbs, is the very same, in kind, as that which pre∣vailed in '93 and '97, occasioned by imported contagion, and was introduced into it, for want of efficient health-laws, and the proper regulation of quarantines, as I propose to make appear in a future paper.</P>
<P>This contagion, however, appears, from numerous obser∣vations, and the most authentic facts, to be capable of pro∣ducing fever, only under <HI>particular</HI> circumstances: these cir∣cumstances,
<PB N="71" REF="035335_0070_1002326A54562570"/>
removed or avoided, the contagion becomes in∣active and harmless.</P>
<P>This fever had not been observed to exist in Philadelphia, for more than thirty years, before the year '93—and has ne∣ver been known to exist in the winter season in this climate; differing in this respect, from those contagious fevers that are bred in jails, hospitals and prison ships; but perfectly re∣sembling the plagues which have been introduced at different times into different maritime towns in Europe from certain parts of Africa, and the Turkish dominions in Europe bor∣dering upon Asia.</P>
<P>The circumstances which render the contagion of the yel∣low fever active, and favour its spreading or becoming epi∣demic, appear to be, hot, rarified and stagnant, or confined air, more especially when replete and altered in its salutary quality by putrid exhalations from dead vegetable and ani∣mal substances. Under the recited circumstances, the majori∣ty of those who approach very near to, or come in contact with the sick, so as to receive the exhalations emitted by the lungs or skin, become in the course of a few days, most com∣monly on the fifth or sixth day after such exposure, affected with the same kind of fever; but as all that approach within the same distance to the sick, do not afterwards take the dis∣ease, though they have received the contagious particles into their bodies, it implies that their constitutions are not dispo∣sed to favour its operation; that is, that they are possessed of a power to resist its action or impression, or that the contagion mixing with the fluids in the stomach, or with those in the arteries, passes out again, with some of the usual excretions.</P>
<P>The circumstances, which, in most cases, appear to give ef∣fect to the contagion, so as to produce fever, after it has been received into the circulation, through the medium of the sto∣mach, lungs or skin, appear to be such as have the power of inducing sudden and great debility in the several functions of the body, and consequent spasm or constriction of the ex∣treme vessels, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Among the chief of these, may be reckoned, sudden expo∣sure to cold, after great fatigue, or after being greatly heated by exercise, and exposure to the scorching rays of the sun.</P>
<P>Intemperance, succeeded by abstinence, frequent blood let∣ting, purging, fasting, and constant terror or dread of the dis∣ease, have all a similar effect. Whereas, moderate and refresh∣ing exercise, the temperate use of such nourishing food as has no tendency to stimulate or inflame, and rather to preserve
<PB N="72" REF="035335_0071_1002326F30235570"/>
the bowels laxative than otherwise, and the temperate use of diluted fermented liquors, particularly found bottled porter and claret, have the most salutary effect in preventing the ope∣ration of the contagion, and also of rendering the disease milder and more manageable by the physician, when it does attack, than when it occurs in those previously debilitated.</P>
<P>The air in the open streets, I believe, never becomes suf∣ficiently contaminated by the contagious particles (let the pa∣tients be ever so numerous in the houses) to communicate the disease to any person walking in the middle of the street, or even on the pavements, when the wind blows from the opposite side. This is a fact not only confirmed by the ob∣servations of the judicious and accurate Dr. Russel, in his account of a pestilential fever at Aleppo, and by all the phy∣sicians that have published an account of the disease, as it has appeared in different parts of Europe, but is also established by the events of last year, and by those of '93.</P>
<P>In the year '93, all the prisoners in the jail of Philadelphia, amounting to more than 200; the prisoners in the alms∣house; and the patients in the Pennsylvania hospital, escaped the disease, owing to the precaution of preventing the admis∣sion of any sick or suspicious person, as well as every infected article into those places.</P>
<P>All the families, also, that remained in the city and con∣fined themselves and their domestics strictly to their own houses, and suffered no sick person, or any one lately recover∣ed from the disorder, or any material from an infected house, to come near them; and employed some trusty person to furnish them with marketing and other necessaries, from sources free from infection, escaped the disease without ex∣ception. This was also the case with all the farmers that at∣tended the market, that cautiously avoided sleeping at, or go∣ing into any of the chambers of the taverns, or places where they put up. This could not have been the case, if the whole atmosphere of the city had been tainted, or replete with noxi∣ous exhalations.</P>
<P>By observing the preceding rules and cautions, therefore, those inhabitants who cannot procure a retreat in the coun∣try, may certainly preserve themselves from taking the fever.</P>
<P>These are consolatory facts, drawn from experienced ob∣servers; and they are facts that may be fitly opposed to the popular notions of contagion, so apt to affect the imagination in moments of consternation and dismay.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I think it proper to add, that I have
<PB N="73" REF="035335_0072_1002327315411DC8"/>
frequently seen persons, whose office it is to attend the sick, escape the disease in large airy apartments, without observ∣ing any precaution at all; but have seldom observed this to be the case in small confined places unfavourable for ventila∣tion, especially where the circumstances of the patient, would not admit of daily changes of the bed and body linen. Clean∣liness, daily changes of apparel, and free ventilation appear, therefore, to be essential for preventing the contagious and malignant effects of the fever.</P>
<P>Perhaps if physicians and nurses were studiously to guard against breathing when near the patient, and were never to swallow their saliva; (by which it is probable the contagion is more frequently conveyed into the body than by any other means) were careful to rince their mouths with cold water and vinegar, brandy and water or wine, and frequently to chew some agreeable aromatic substance; were never to ap∣proach the sick with an empty stomach, and were to rub half a drachm or a drachm of mercurial ointment upon their limbs every night till it occasioned tenderness of the mouth, it would prevent the contagion from operating, or at least ren∣der the disease much more mild and manageable when it did occur.</P>

<P>In consequence of the robbery, on the 2d of September, the banks of North-America and Pennsylvania, removed to Germantown on the 4th, and were soon afterwards followed by the bank of the United States. About this period, the corporation caused a number of stalls to be erected at the Centre House Tavern, on Market street, for the accommo∣dation of the citizens who had retired to the vicinity of the city, that they might be supplied with the necessaries of life, without exposing themselves to the disease, by going into the heart of the city.</P>
<P>The salutary effects of the address of the Board of Health, of September 1st, began now to be discovered—liberal dona∣tions, for the relief of the poor, from all the neighbouring towns, in cash, provisions, &amp;c. were daily received.—The citizens of Baltimore were among the first who engaged in this very humane duty.

<P>In consequence of the notice yesterday, given in the Fe∣deral Gazette, a number of the respectable inhabitants of this city, met at the court-house, when James Calhoun, mayor, was appointed chairman, and Joseph Townsend, se∣cretary.</P>
<P>The meeting proceeded to take into consideration the distressed circumstance of a number of the inhabitants of Phi∣ladelphia, occasioned by a malignant disorder raging in that city and suburbs, as being movingly represented by the com∣munication of the Board of Health of that place, on the 1st instant—and being desirous to afford some assistance to alleviate their present awful calamity.</P>
<P><HI>Do unanimously resolve,</HI> That a subscription be opened by the members of the City Council in each ward, for the pur∣pose aforesaid, and the money, when received, be paid into the hands of the mayor of the city, to be forwarded by him to the Board of Health at Philadelphia.</P>

your view, the deplorable state of our city, and to excite into active exertion, the philanthropy and benevolence so emi∣nently characteristic of the citizens of Pennsylvania. The same generous sentiments which you have displayed, has in∣fluenced the worthy and benevolent citizens of Baltimore; who, always alive to the feeling of humanity, have, it appears, by the public papers, agreed to a subscription, for the relief of our distressed fellow citizens.</P>
<P>We return them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the gratitude and respect to which dispositions so amiable are entitled; but, it becomes our duty publicly to state, that a fund has been provided for the pur∣pose, upon the principle of a loan, in anticipation of the libe∣rality and justice of our Legislature, which precludes the ne∣cessity of donations in money, from the humane citizens of our sister states. Contributions of provisions from our fellow citizens in the country, as well in New-Jersey, as in our own state, have been forwarded for the use of the distressed, with a liberality which does honor to the donors.</P>

<P>About the 12th or 14th of September, the disease began to appear among the convicts in the criminals' jail. One died on the 17th, and two more on the 18th, and several were lying sick. In consequence of which, the vagrant and untried
<PB N="76" REF="035335_0075_1001FEB97052E150"/>
criminals, male and female, were removed to Morris's Buil∣dings. The whole number of prisoners in the jail, at this time, including debtors, was about three hundred.</P>
<P>On the 18th, several of them attempted to make their escape by force, in absence of the jailor. Perhaps they were part∣ly led to this rash act, to avoid the contagion which was then raging in the jail, and perhaps because there was little dan∣ger of being taken, from the unprotected state of the city. But, in this project, they were frustrated, by the undaunted vigilance of Robert Wharton, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> then one of the alder∣men of the city, now mayor, with a few assistants; two of the criminals were shot, and one wounded with a bayonet before the rest surrendered.</P>
<P>In consequence of the above proceedings, and the several robberies, which had been committed; a number of the ci∣tizens formed themselves into an association, for the protec∣tion of the city, during this deserted and unprotected period. Their proceedings will be noticed in the next chapter.</P>
<P>The Board of Health, in order to remove, if possible, the aversion retained against the City Hospital, and to induce the sick, who were destitute of the conveniencies which their situation required, to consent to be taken to the Hospital, published the following comparative statement between the mortality at the City Hospital, and that of the City and Li∣berties:</P>

<P>The Board of Managers of the Marine and City Hos∣pitals present to public view, the following simple statement of comparative facts, in order to remove prejudices, and just∣ly appreciate the importance and utility of an institution, which, from the dreadful mortality of the prevailing disease, has been viewed with a jaundiced eye.</P>
<P>Tis not enough that the City Hospital is amply provid∣ed with every thing which can contribute to the comfort and cure of the sick, and is under the direction of a resident phy∣sician, whose medical skill is no less an ornament to his pre∣fession than his benevolent and DISINTERESTED services are a blessing to society—'Tis an Hospital, and that is an insu∣perable objection with the weak and the prejudiced.</P>
<P>Let incontrovertible facts speak for themselves—and take notice, that a vast majority of the cases are sent there in the most desperate and protracted state of the disease.</P>

<P>They met at the Senate Chamber, in the State House, on the Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, of each week, from three to six o'clock in the afternoon; where they invited the indigent to apply for relief, and to bring with them certifi∣cates from one or more respectable inhabitants, to evidence that their families were in such a situation as to render it improper to remove to the tents.</P>
<P>About the 21st of September, the fever first appeared in the Pennsylvania Hospital. It is supposed to have been introduced by one of the nurses, who brought some clothes from the city a few days previous.</P>
<P>The repeated robberies and thefts, induced the corpora∣tion to double the number of ordinary watchmen; who, in junction with the patrols, appointed by the citizens, con∣tinued to guard the city both day and night.</P>
<P>On the 22d of September, a number of the members of the society of Friends held their annual meeting; but ad∣journed, on account of the fever, till December. About fif∣ty Friends, from different parts of the country, attended this meeting. Of these, seventeen were soon after attacked with the fever, twelve of whom died. The majority were attack∣ed within five days after leaving the city, tho' many of them resided here but one, and others only two days.</P>
<P>About the end of September and the beginning of Octo∣ber, the disease attained to its crisis. The greatest number of new cases, reported in one day, during the whole period of the calamity, was, <HI>one hundred and twenty-seven.</HI> This was on the 7th of September. On the 21st, there were one hundred and twenty-six new cases reported. On the 19th of September, thirty-two sick persons were admitted into the City Hospital; and, on the 26th of the same month, sixteen died. These were the greatest number of admissions and deaths that occurred. The highest number of patients, remaining in the Hospital, was 164. This was on the
<PB N="79" REF="035335_0078_100232957B42FD70"/>
22d of Sept. On the evening and night of the 27th, there was a great fall of rain, which suddenly cooled the air. Pro∣bably, in consequence of this, the mortality on the succeed∣ing day was greater than at any other period of the fever. One hundred and six persons were interred.</P>
<P>By comparing the tables of new cases, and of mortality, &amp;c. as annexed, with the register of the weather, it will be found, that both new cases and deaths were augmented in consequence of either rainy, damp, or sudden cool weather; but, that in a day or two afterwards, both were diminished.</P>

<P>The Board of Managers of the Marine and City Hospitals, felicitate their fellow-citizens on the rapid decline of the prevailing fever since the 1st inst.—the prosperous state of the City Hospital, and enlivening prospect of a speedy termina∣tion of the calamity, which has overwhelmed our city. None can more assiduously desire the return of their fellow-citizens, <HI>in safety,</HI> to the comforts of their own fire-side; but they de∣precate the consequences of precipitation, where so much caution and prudence is required.</P>
<P>The apprehension of the Board has been awakened, by the too-hasty return of many individuals, who have inconsiderate∣ly hazarded their own health and the public welfare: sever∣al of whom, the Board are sorry to add, have been seized with the fever shortly after their return.</P>
<P>The weather, since the 6th inst. has been extremely un∣favourable, and the number of the sick have considerably en∣creased; which would evidently be augmented by the ac∣cumulation of persons, particularly those from a pure at∣mosphere. The Board earnestly solicit public attention to considerations so important; and entreat the forbearance of their fellow-citizens, until returning health shall invite them home.</P>
<P>The Board cannot too strongly impress the propriety and necessity of cleansing and purifying, (previous to the return of the inhabitants,) the bedding, cloathing, and houses, in which the disease has existed; for which purpose, they re∣commend <HI>the liberal use of lime.</HI> They also repeat their re∣commendation to the Commissioners, to have the pumps fre∣quently and copiously worked, as the water is now extremely offensive and unwholesome.</P>

<P>Notwithstanding this exhortation of the Board of Health, many families, whose situations in the country, was, perhaps, not very agreeable, returned to the city. It was doubtless in consequence of this, that both the new cases and deaths sustained an increase. Many paragraphs appeared in the newspapers, dissuading the citizens from returning, until the
<PB N="81" REF="035335_0080_1002329BB7CA2A60"/>
Board of Health should notify to them that the danger no longer existed. Even examples were mentioned: the most striking of which was the case of the family of John Light∣body, bookbinder. They returned to the city about the 15th of October, together with another family each consisting of three persons: the whole were taken sick, and five died.

<P>In the termination of a painful duty, we cannot repress our sentiments of respectful veneration for the unexampled benevolence and charity which you have displayed—the suf∣fering sick, the widow, and the fatherless have been cherish∣ed; and hundreds of grateful fellow-creatures have been wrested from the grasp of disease and death, by your boun∣ty.—These virtues are a certain pledge, that the objects which you have safely conducted through the tempest of disease, will not be abandoned to the miseries of an incle∣ment winter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Summary of the proceedings at the City Hospital—Encampments on the Schuylkill, and Masters's place—Association for the protection of the city—Robbery of the bank—Proceedings in the jail—and at different parts of the union, during the ca∣lamity.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAVING, in the preceding pages, traced the rise, pro∣gress, and decline of the disease, we now proceed, in a sum∣mary manner, to mention some occurrences, which could not be previously noticed, without interfering with the ge∣neral connection of subject.</P>
<P>The most important proceedings of the Board of Health, we have thought proper to notice, as they are replete with information to the various stages of the calamity.—No class or body of men were of more service to the city, throughout the whole gloomy period, than these individuals.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The members who remained at their posts, and who merit the gratitude of the public, are recorded in page 63. It includes the whole Board, except Messrs. John Newbold, and James Wood. After the establishment of tents at Masters's place, Mr. John Ins<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eep presided there.</NOTE> Their indefatigable exertions—their arrangements in the city, and at the City Hospital, with those of the Overseers and Guar∣dians of the poor, for alleviating distress, were judicious and salutary. It was the general custom of the Board to meet and deliberate every morning at 11 o'clock. They framed the regulations for the management of the City Hospital, and saw that they were properly executed. Messrs. William Jones, William Dawson, and (previous to his death) Isaac Price, were the members who most frequently visited the Hospital for this purpose. The burial of the dead was like∣wise conducted by the regulations of the Board: they pro∣vided coffins, hearses, &amp;c. Most of the coffins (rough pine boxes) were made in the jail by convicts. In the height of the disease, the deaths were so numerous, that the Board found it necessary to employ common carts: the number of
<PB N="83" REF="035335_0082_1001FE87036E1128"/>
hearses were inadequate; and even, with this assistance, they were frequently under the necessity of conveying the dead to the grave in the same coachees which carried the sick to the Hospital. Two, and even three bodies were often car∣ried together: about twelve hearses and carts, and three coachees, were in constant employ. An improvement was made, for the more easy conveyance of the sick patients, in the advanced stage of their sickness. They could not be re∣moved, without injury, in the coachees. The Board caused three swing carriages to be made, by which the sick could lay at their whole length in a bed, suspended from the shafts, between the wheels. Thus, they were conveyed with such ease, as ameliorated some of the former consequent distresses, without being disturbed by the jolting of the carriage. The carriages, with horses, stood always ready, in the <HI>old</HI> Potter's Field.</P>
<P>For the receipts and expenditures of the Board, together with a sketch of their proceedings, as detailed in their letter to the governor, <HI>see appendix, page XXV.</HI></P>
<P>The City Hospital stands on a low, flat piece of ground, on the east bank of the Schuylkill, in Sassafras-street; with a tract of marshy ground in front: The situation cannot be healthy. Formerly it was occupied for a tavern, when the summer-houses, in the garden, were erected.—The build∣ings, for the accommodation of the sick, consist of two large frame houses: their form is an oblong square, two stories high. The largest was erected, during the prevalence of the last calamity, when the other was inadequate to contain the number of sick. The summer-houses were covered with canvass, and a few small sheds were erected for the con∣valescent. There are also stables and other out-houses.—The management of the hospital was entrusted to the physicians, a steward and a matron, under the inspection of the Board of Health. It was opened for the reception of the sick about the 8th of August. They were placed under the care of Drs. Physick and Cooper; gentlemen, eminent for medical skill and goodness of heart.—They made a voluntary offer of their services to the Board.—There Dr. Cooper died, a vic∣tim to the contagion, much regretted. Dr. Rush assisted as con∣sulting physician, and Drs. May and Watt were appointed to compound the medicines, &amp;c. From the 6th of September, and to the 6th of October, there were never less than one hundred patients in the Hospital, nor more than one hundred and sixty-four.—Medicine, fruit, wine, changes of linen, and
<PB N="84" REF="035335_0083_10023181B02A1FB8"/>
every other article, necessary for relief, comfort, and accom∣modation, were amply provided.</P>
<P>The scenes of distress which the Hospital exhibited, were truly dismal:—there we could hear the groans—the moan∣ings—and the heavy sighs of "the hundreds sick." No con∣nexions were near to view their distress, or to soothe, with the tear of friendship, their "little hour." When the coachees, which brought out the sick, arrived, often might be seen an affrightened patient enter, supported by strange Nurses, and bedewing his or her cheeks with tears. The nurses were often obliged to hold the patient in bed by force, when struggling with delirium, and others seemed to sleep out their life with∣out any feeling, while the screams of many were heard at a distance. Some bled from the mouth and nose, and the black vomit issued, in streams, from others. Two, and frequently three, were placed in one coffin.</P>
<P>The men and women occupied different wards. Particu∣lar attention was paid by the nurses to the sick, both day and night.—No complaints have been made; but letters of thanks have frequently been sent to the physicians and managers for kind treatment and attention.</P>
<P>Few of the nurses at the Hospital were attacked with the disease, although exposed to concentrated contagion. It was often customary for them to sleep on the same bed with the sick, and some have been known to swallow a portion of the juices of the sick, without experiencing any injury.—Dr. Physick informed us, that he has frequently seen a nurse helping a patient to a spoonful of food, and taking another, herself, alternately: that he has also seen them eat the fruit that has been gnawed by the sick. One or two instances occurred of wives nursing their husbands in the Hospital, and mothers their children; none of which took the disease, tho' lying on the same bed. During the whole period of the sickness, there were 899<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the tables of daily returns.</NOTE> persons admitted into the Hospital, of which 518 died.</P>
<P>The City Hospital burial-ground, was the general recep∣tacle for the dead, from the beginning of August to the first of November. Graves were dug, at the commencement of the calamity, for every corpse; but, afterwards, two or three were put into one pit. The accumulated mortality, which commenced about the end of August, rendered this mode
<PB N="85" REF="035335_0084_10023184C282CE98"/>
impracticable. A more expeditious method of interment was adopted. A large trench was dug, in which the cof∣fins were piled upon each other. It was conducted in such a manner, that the fresh mould, dug from one end, covered the dead in another; while the hearses were drove to the bottom of the trench, where they deposited the bodies. In two of these trenches, upwards of fifteen hundred were in∣terred; twelve or fourteen diggers were employed. They remained, as observed before, in the field, night and day. Sheds were constructed for their accommodation. Some were buried in this ground, who are not mentioned in our list. It was not unfrequent for the grave-diggers to find a dead body in the morning, which had been thrown over the fence during the preceding night.</P>
<P>After most of the citizens, whose circumstances would permit, had fled to the country, the poor began, generally, to suffer, and the disease sustained no abatement. It rather con∣tinued to spread, and little hope remained that it would ter∣minate, until it should be destroyed by frost. A removal of the healthy was the only hope left for its mitigation. The Board of Health, in junction with the Guardians of the Poor, concerted measures for the construction of temporary tents. These were soon afterwards erected on the banks of Schuyl∣kill, between Spruce and Chesnut-streets. They were ready by the 24th of August, where fugitives crouded. A certifi∣cate was necessary, to gain admission, from some respectable citizen, with an application to any of the following gentle∣men, who were appointed a joint committee from the Board of Health and Guardians of the Poor to superintend this en∣campment: Peter Mierken, Isaac Price, James Oldden, John Kehr.</P>
<P>They crouded, in the greatest abundance, from the south parts of the City and Southwark: They were accommodated with every necessary of life, principally from the donations of the opulent. The tents were made of canvass, and floored with boards. Here nineteen hundred and fifty persons were fed, and some of them cloathed! While we admire the liberality of the public, which was displayed on this occa∣sion, we are induced to mention, that in many instances, ad∣vantages were taken. Many sordid souls removed, and were fed and cloathed, who possessed independent resources. The names of freeholders, who hold property to the amount of several thousands of dollars, could be mentioned, who here
<PB N="86" REF="035335_0085_10023186518AD070"/>
robbed the poor of their pittance. The liberal hand must move reluctant, under an idea of such a diabolical practice. Credit is due to the committee who superintended this establishment, for both their attention and trouble. The rules which they fra∣med were judicious, and well adapted to the situation and man∣ners of each class. Some, as might naturally be supposed, were not the most orderly; such were either sent to Morris's Build∣ings, or confined in a temporary prison, at the encampment. Guards were stationed with arms, to preserve order, and pre∣vent any individuals from trespassing the rules. Schools, for the instruction of children, were instituted; at which 137 male, and 143 female children, attended. The hearty men were employed, in digging the canal. Public worship was performed on Sundays; and medical advice, and attendance was given by Dr. S. Dussield.</P>
<P>About the beginning of November, the committee were in need of cloathing for infants. They published the fol∣lowing:</P>

<P>About the beginning of September, another encampment was erected at Masters' Place, near the Mill-Pond, on the road to Germantown, about two miles from the city, for the same benevolent purpose as that on the Schuylkill; to which the fugitives, principally from the Northern-Liberties and Kensington, flocked. John Inskeep, Jonathan Robeson, and Isaac W. Morris, were appointed a committee for its super∣intendance. It was composed of wooden sheds, comforta∣ble, convenient, and, in every respect, adapted to the occasion; especially when it is considered that they were erected in eight or ten days, and accommodated upwards of <HI>two thousand persons.</HI> Besides the lodging-sheds, there were erect∣ed an hospital, a large store-house, and office, a bake-house and oven, and five kitchens, with eight large fire-places. This encampment was situated on a well-chosen spot, and laid out in regular order: the streets intersected each other. The rules and regulations, which were printed and posted up in different places in the encampment, do honour to the committee. Spirituous liquors were prohibited, except in cases of supposed necessity. Slight offences were punished, by withholding provisions for a reasonable time; and, for those of a more aggravated nature, the offender was expelled. All
<PB N="88" REF="035335_0087_1002318CD3105730"/>
intercourse with the city was cut off, except on urgent occa∣sions. This was enforced, by placing centinels, at proper dis∣tances, around the encampment. Scavengers were appoint∣ed, whose duty it was, every morning, to remove all the filth, and to throw fresh earth into the necessaries; and, in every other respect, the utmost attention was paid to cleanliness. They were abundantly supplied with provisions of every kind; the arrangement for the delivery of the rations was well plan∣ned, and the most scrupulous regard to justice observed in the distribution. The decorum, which was so eminently maintained in the encampment, amongst characters, too, some of which were not the most amiable, reflect great honour both on the superintendants, and the example of many virtu∣ous families, who resided there. The first public address of the superintendants was on the 10th of September: they in∣formed the public, that they stood in need of vegetables, straw, &amp;c. for the use of the distressed citizens, who had ta∣ken refuge there; and they hoped that they would experience the same liberality which had been extended to the Schuylkill encampment; having the same laudable object in view. This public intimation produced an abundant supply. On the 28th of the same month, the committee publicly ac∣knowledged, that the liberality which they had experienced, surpassed all expectation: that several villages and neigh∣bourhoods in New-Jersey, had been eminently bountiful on this occasion; that the supplies which they had occasionally received, had been abundant, <HI>except in articles of cloathing:</HI> they had received some very handsome donations in that line; but not in sufficient abundance to supply their pressing and numerous wants: that the number, under their care, was daily encreasing, and already amounted to upwards of <HI>thirteen hundred persons,</HI> composed of both sexes, from one hour to eighty years old; but, that the greater proportion of them, were helpless women and children. About two hundred of the children were at the breast, the mothers of whom were generally without shoe or stocking. The committee sug∣gested, that linsey, flannels, and woollen stockings, would be particularly acceptable, as well as every description of se∣cond-hand and ready-made cloathing. From this period, the lists of donations swelled with individual bounty. Our ci∣tizens seemed to vie with each other who should be the most liberal. Drs. Currie and Dewees, gratuitously offered their services to the committee. Great attention and care was bestowed upon the sick in this encampment, which
<PB N="89" REF="035335_0088_1002318F27727708"/>
was numerous. A few had the yellow fever. These gentle∣men received a public declaration of thanks from the committee.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this encampment returned to their homes, generally, about the 1st of November; but not before they had published a grateful and affectionate tribute of laudable praise to their meritorious committee.</P>

<P>There were about two thousand and twenty-four persons supplied at this encampment from the 15th and 20th of Sep∣tember to the 1st of November.</P>
<P>It is a melancholy truth, that the most awful afflictions which befal our fellow-creatures, are not sufficient to awa∣ken, in some minds, even the feelings of sympathy. Callous to every sentiment of humanity, and dead to every principle of virtue, some wretches, who, to the eternal disgrace of the human character, were so totally depraved, that while walking even "in the valley of the shadow of death," medi∣tated and committed the most abominable crimes. While every virtuous mind was filled with sympathetic sorrow for that general gloom, which hovered over the city, there were vil∣lains lurking about, watching every opportunity, during the absence of the citizens, to commit robbery on their deserted houses. Notwithstanding that the number of ordinary watch∣men had been augmented, and patrols appointed to watch it during the day, several robberies were committed. The bank of Pennsylvania, as observed before, was robbed; and attempts were made by the prisoners in the cri∣minals jail to escape. A consideration of these circum∣stances, and the general unguarded state of the city, indu∣ced a number of private citizens, to associate for the purpose of affording it better protection.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="035335_0089_100233FC592DC918"/>
Of this association, the following gentlemen were chosen officers:

<P>The association informed the public, that their intentions were merely to have a body of men ready to turn out, armed and equipped, on any sudden emergency, or to mount guard at any of the prisons, or elsewhere, if necessary; by thus being ready with arms and ammunition, to repair, at the first notice, to their respective alarm posts, that they might act with the greatest promptitude and efficiency, and that the civil magis∣trates and other good citizens might know where to find a body of men, prepared, to enforce a due obedience to the laws, and preserve order and tranquility.</P>
<P>The citizens were informed that in cases of fire, or riot in the city, the <HI>old</HI> Potter's-Field was chosen as the alarm post, or rallying point, from its central situation, and con∣tiguity to both jails and Morris's Building, then the place of confinement for vagrants; in the Northern Liberties, the city-hall or town-house; and in Southwark, Little's school house, to which all the members of the association were to re∣pair equipped, and there await the orders or presence of their own officers, a magistrate, or other civil officer.</P>
<P>The alarm was to be given by firing a field piece.</P>

<HEAD>Robbery of the Bank of Pennsylvania.</HEAD>
<P>On the night of the 4th of August, some villains entered the bank, and made an unsuccessful attempt to force open the doors of the cash vault, and to pick the lock of an iron chest; but the institution sustained no loss; as it was apprehended that the attempt would be renewed, and considering the in∣security of the building, and the impossibility of making such repairs to it as would render it safe, the porters were armed, and directed to sleep in the banking-house, in order to guard against the success of future attempts. The immediate re∣moval of the bank to Carpenter's-hall was proposed. This building, from its construction, and the improvements which had been made to it, when in the occupancy of the Bank of the United States, was thought perfectly secure; but previ∣ously to the removal, which took place on the Saturday fol∣lowing, a new patent lock was put to the outer door, and two
<PB N="91" REF="035335_0090_100231BA491E8C88"/>
iron doors were fitted to the cash vault, with locks which had been used for the book vault, and which were of a better con∣struction than any which could at that time be procured in the city. The precaution of obliging the porters to sleep in the Bank was continued, and the watchmen were charged to be particularly vigilant.</P>
<P>Thomas Cunningham, the porter, who is since dead, slept there alone, and early in the morning of Sunday the 2d of September, Mr. Annesley, the runner, having occasion to go to the Bank, found the back door of the banking house open; and looking into the banking room, he discovered the doors of the back vault likewise open. He immediately roused Cunningham, who was asleep up stairs; they found all the windows secured, the back door unbarred, and the doors of the cash vault unlocked. Upon an examination of the house, it was found that the locks had been opened by false keys, for no injury was done to the wards of any of them, nor was there any appearance of force having been used.</P>
<P>The loss which the institution had sustained, amounted to <HI>one hundred and sixty-two thousand eight hundred and twenty-one dollars and sixty-one cents.</HI></P>
<P>Every exertion was made to discover the perpetrators of this flagrant robbery. Advertisements were published throughout the United States, cautioning the public against the receipt of the post-notes stolen. Considerable rewards were offered for the apprehension of those concerned in the robbery, in addition to that of <HI>one thousand dollars,</HI> promised in the governor's proclamation. "Several persons were ar∣rested upon suspicion, and amongst those was Patrick Lyon, the smith, who was employed in fitting the iron doors of the cash vault, <HI>and without whose privity it is believed this robbery has not been committed.</HI>"</P>
<P>After unceasing vigilance they had the satisfaction to dis∣cover the perpetrator of this daring robbery, so that the whole amount of the property stolen was recovered, except about three thousand two hundred dollars.</P>
<P>One Isaac Davis, a carpenter, had an account open in this bank: The first circumstance which excited suspicions a∣gainst him, was a deposit of 16,000 dollars. Enquiry was made respecting his circumstances and character, which were found to be such, as to induce the officers of the bank to watch his conduct. On the 17th of November, he made another deposit of 3,910 dollars. The suspicions were now increased, and it was thought proper to enquire at the other
<PB N="92" REF="035335_0091_100231BC0DF833D0"/>
banks, whether he had made any deposits with them? when such information was obtained, as left no doubt but that he was the robber. He was then apprehended, and, partly by threats, and partly by promise of an intercession with the go∣vernor for his pardon, the confession of his guilt was extor∣ted from him.</P>
<P>His disclosures criminated only Thomas Cunningham, the late porter, and himself; for, he repeatedly declared, that they alone were concerned in the robbery. It was remarked, that Thomas Cunningham slept in the bank the night that the robbery was committed, and that he was taken ill of the yellow fever the day after and died in the course of the week. Davis said that they had divided the money stolen, and that the deposits he had made in the different banks, were part of his share. He assured them that he had re∣turned all he was possessed of, and that the remainder of the property stolen, would be found at the house where Cun∣ningham died. They searched the house described, but with∣out success. Davis was informed that unless he made a full disclosure, he would be committed to prison, and his house searched: By threats and promises, he acknowledged that he had visited Cunningham the day he was taken ill, and had received from him the remainder of the money stolen, a great part of which he had still secreted. They had then re∣covered in all 158<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>999 dollars and 53 cents: Davis also as∣signed over property which had cost him a short time before 800 dollars.</P>
<P>Davis declared that the plan of the robbery originated with Cunningham, who procured the false keys, and that he does not know who made them.</P>
<P>The tenor of this is taken from the report of the commit∣tee, of the State Assembly, who were appointed-to make en∣quiry on the subject. They received their information from the officers of the bank. The attempt on the 4th of August, and the robbery on the 1st September, were supposed to be committed by the same persons. It does not appear evident that Cunningham, the porter, had any concern in the rob∣bery. He was found asleep in the bank next morning; nei∣ther his conduct nor countenance discovered the least symp∣toms of guilt, even to make him suspected. None of the money was found with him, when he died. No evidence but that of Davis, appears to criminate him; and his death prevents his pleading in his own defence. It is not uncom∣mon, in criminal cases, for the innocent to suffer punish∣ment for the guilty: That Mr. Lyon, who fitted the doors
<PB N="93" REF="035335_0092_100231C0D1E6A058"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> vault, should, at first, be implicated, was, perhaps, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; but, after the perpetrator was discovered, and after Mr. Lyon was discharged, by a grand jury, from the charges alleged against him, an idea should not be impressed upon the public mind, founded upon <HI>presumption</HI> only, that he is the man, "<HI>without whose privity, it is believed, this robbery has not been committed</HI>" This is cruel, and injurious to an ingeni∣ous, industrious tradesman, who required the preservation of character, to render his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> useful to himself, and to the public.</P>

<P>A convict, named Bradley, was the first person attacked in the criminals' jail. He was confined in a cell. At this time, it raged in an alley that runs from Fifth-street, near to the jail-wall, opposite to the cells; from whence it is sup∣posed to have reached Bradley, whose window it fronted.—He was removed on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of September, and died in a few hours after. From him, the disease communicated to other prisoners; the number of which, including debtors, amoun∣ted to upwards of three hundred. Shortly afterwards, the vagrants, and prisoners confined for petty offences, were re∣moved to Morris's-Buildings, and the debtors to Norris∣town: The convicts, amounting to about one hundred and sixty, and untried of prisoners, near an hundred, then, only, remained in gaol. Mr. Smith, the Jailor, on the appear∣ance of the disease, became alarmed. He relinquished his charge on the 8th of September, and removed to the country. Robert Wharton, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>, a vigilant and active magistrate, now mayor of our city, then assumed it. He resided there, and performed all the duties of jailor, until shortly after the 17th of September, when he was assisted by Mr. Peter Helm; who, afterwards, took upon himself the charge. The services <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rendered by Mr. Helm, during the calamity in 1793, when he presided at Rush-Hill-Hospital, and in 1797, when he superintended the City-Hospital, at the Wigwam, together with his services this year, justly en∣title him to thanks. He was active in these different capa∣cities, and zealously and undauntedly run into danger—but, the palm seems to rest upon other characters: Like the pea∣cock in the fable, which other birds wished to vie with, some have been plucking his feathers.</P>
<P>After Mr. Helm took charge of the jail, he resided there day and night—watched the convicts, and attended the sick, alternately. Some of the keepers left the jail shortly after
<PB N="94" REF="035335_0093_100231DB27F7B468"/>
Mr. Smith. Others were taken sick. Their places were supplied by constables, &amp;c. The sick prisoners were atten∣ded by Dr. Benjamin Duffield. He caused every humane and salutary measure to be adopted for their accommodation. They were removed from the healthy, to a ward in the east wing, which was converted into an hospital. The convales∣cents were kept in a separate apartment. Strict attention was paid to cleanliness, for the better security against the spread∣ing of the disease. The green wood was removed from the yard; all rubbage and putrifiable materials, were carried off: The obstructed water-channel was cleared: The pavement was frequently washed, and kept wet and cool, by means of the pump; and the sleeping wards, were, as usual, constant∣ly ventilated. To these precautions, which were adopted by direction of Mr. Caleb Lownes, with their simple healthy di∣et, and the entire prohibition of every kind of liquor, is, per∣haps, to be ascribed, the successful escape of so large a propor∣tion of the prisoners. The disease spread through every quar∣ter of the jail. <HI>'Dutch Hannah',</HI> a convict, was the first vic∣tim in the west wing, where the females are kept. Several of the convicts voluntarily offered their services as nurses, and attended the sick with tenderness and attention. One John Brown was the first that made this laudable offer.—He was taken sick, and died. There were, in all, forty-four cases in the jail; of which, twenty-seven paid their last debt to Nature. Nine were sent to the City-Hospital; two of which, only, recovered. Thirty-five were attended in jail; twenty of these survived.</P>
<P>On the 18th of August, some of the prisoners in the east wing attempted to escape. Perhaps they were instigated from a consideration of the unguarded state of the ci∣ty—the absence of the jailor—and a wish to escape from the fever. They took the advantage of a visit from the physician. They seized upon the key of their apartment—forced their way out, knocked down Mr. Evans, a constable, then one of the assistant-keepers, and called to the convicts in the yard to come to their assistance. Mr. Wharton, who was in a dif∣ferent part of the jail, on hearing the alarm, went immedi∣ately to the assistance of the keepers. Miller, the ring-leader, had an axe lifted to <HI>dispatch</HI> Mr. Evans, which Mr. R. Whar∣ton, and Mr. G. Gass, an assistant-keeper, observing, pre∣vented, by well directed balls from their muskets, which broke the bone of his right arm, and entered his body.—Mr. Wharton and Mr. Gass fired at the same time: the ball from the latter, it was generally supposed, proved fatal.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="035335_0094_100231E0C055E448"/>
Another of the assailants, of the name of Vaughan, struck Mr. Evans with a bar of iron. He then retreated to his apartment. Evans pursued him, and lodged a ball in his lungs. He survived it about twenty-four hours. A Ne∣gro convict wounded another by a bayonet. They even∣tually drove the gang into their apartments. During the disturbance, the convicts behaved well: They did not even show a wish to aid the offenders. The bravery and prompt exertions of Mr. Wharton, deserve a high encomium.—Join∣ed by Mr. Evans and Mr. Gass, the designs of these incorri∣gible villains were happily frustrated, and the city, in all pro∣bability, only thus preserved from devastation and pillage.</P>
<P>An unsuccessful attempt was afterwards made by two of the criminals, who were confined in the east dungeon.—They had nearly effected their escape, by undermining the wall, when first discovered.</P>
<P>On the night of the 18th of October, seven of the prisoners were successful in making their escape. They undermined the wall of the east wing, and got off; and only two of the banditti were taken.</P>
<P>Several sea-port towns in the United States, besides Phila∣delphia, have been inflicted with the same calamity this sum∣mer. It visited New-York about the 28th or 30th of July, nearly at the same period as it did here. The first public intimation of its introduction there, was made on the 6th of August. The citizens did not generally leave the town till the end of August, and towards the beginning of Septem∣ber. Then the disease had made considerable progress. The deaths amounted from twenty-three to twenty-five a-day.—It is estimated, that one third to one-half of the whole inha∣bitants left that city. It continued to rage till the 8th or 10th of November. During this period, the deaths amounted to two thousand and eighty-six. One thousand five hundred and twenty-four, of these, fell victims to its rage. The enquiries made, to ascertain its cause, have generally been directed to those objects which tend to prove its domestic origin. Hence, perhaps, it is, that this idea is the most prevalent there.</P>
<P>Its introduction in Boston happened about the first of July. On the 4th of August, the selectmen had a con∣sultation with the physicians: From whose reports, it appear∣ed, that only sixteen persons had died with that disease since its first appearance; and that there were but ten persons then sick: That in all the cases, the probability was, that
<PB N="96" REF="035335_0095_100231EEDF2D4AF0"/>
the infection was taken in or near the Town-dock. That the disease did not appear, in any instance, to be communica∣ted from one person to another; "no physician, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, or attendant on the sick, having, at that time, taken the disor∣der."</P>
<P>At the same consultation, the physicians gave their opinion, that lobsters and oysters, at that season of the year, and until the middle of September, were extremely pernicious to the health, and predisposed the body to putrid disorders.</P>
<P>From this time, a regular report of the number of deaths and of the sick was published, by order of the selectmen, sign∣ed by Wm. Cooper, town-clerk. On the 20th of August, there were twenty sick; on the 31st, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to thirty-two, and continued to increase until the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th of September, when there were ninety-seven cases. Afterwards, it gradu∣ally abated until tho 6th of October, when it was checked at the approach of frost, and a succession of cold weather.—On the 18th, the inhabitants were invited to return from exile.</P>
<P>It made its appearance at Portsmouth. (N. H.) about the 20th of July, and raged until the beginning of October. Previous to the 20th of August, eleven persons died, seven∣teen were sick on the 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th, five on the 10th of Septem∣ber; and but only one case appeared on the 5th of October. A committee of health was instituted; they made their first report on the 30th of August. Whether its inhabitants ge∣nerally ascribe this scourge to importation, or to domestic origin, cannot be determined by us, nor, perhaps, by them.</P>
<P>A few cases occurred in Newport, (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>) which excited alarm; but, upon investigation, made by the town-council, they traced the cause <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the shipping, or to persons who had taken the contagion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> did not generally spread, nor was the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> great.</P>
<P>New-London: in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was also partially visited. On the 18th of September forty-six were sick. The great∣est number of new cases occurred between the 20th and 25th of September. It ceased about the end of October.</P>
<P>Some cases appeared in Portland, Maine. It did not there rapidly spread.</P>
<P>Shortly after its commencement in Philadelphia, it extended to the neighbouring towns. At Wilmington, (Delaware,) it raged, at least with equal violence, if not superior, in pro∣portion to the number of inhabitants, than it did in our city. They traced its origin to a communication with Philadel∣phia. It subsided nearly at the same time as here. Two
<PB N="97" REF="035335_0096_1002320070D74BC0"/>
Hundred and fifty-two died. Fifty died at Chestor, and at Marcus-Hook, fifty-two—at Chew's Landing, a small vil∣lage in New-Jersey, ten miles from Philadelphia, twenty-six died—and at Cooper's Ferry, opposite to the city, about the same number. There were also many cases at Trenton, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amberton, Frankford, Bristol, &amp;c. Many fell victims.—In Germantown and its neighbourhood, fifty-eight <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> occurred, of which thirty-three died; thirty-seven of the cases were actually in Germantown: of those, twenty died.</P>
<P>Some went from the city with the disease on them; others were out but one day previous to being attacked; but, generally, at about three, and sometimes six days after. In some instances, it was not taken till they had been out ten, twelve, fourteen, and even twenty-one days. The period between receiving it, and its coming into action, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ried in different constitutions. In the full and vigo∣rous, it was less than in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Intemperance, a dread of it, fatigue or exposure to the sun, facilitated its ac∣tion. Its violence was, in some cases, as great as in the city, and its termination in death as speedy; but, in general, the cases were protracted. Some had the black-vomit, and ex∣pired in convulsions, and a great number of the successful, as well as unsuccessful cases, assumed a yellowish colour.</P>
<P>The following paragraphs, from newspapers, state that it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in several other parts of the continent; but, we are not, however, in possession of any other evidence:</P>
<P>"One-sixth part of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> of inhabitants, re∣siding at City-Point (V), have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> in the course twenty-odd days"—"that the fatal malady was spread by the ship Nestor, of Portland, captain Wait, which vessel arri∣ved at City-Point, from Philadelphia, on the 24th August, having thrown four dead hands overboard on her passage.—Being without hands to load with tobacco, Negroes were cal∣led upon; and, out of eleven, thus employed, ten have died. Almost every case can be traced to this vessel."</P>
<P>"Bilious fevers are unusually numerous and obstinate in many parts of the country; and, in several interior towns, very fatal. At New-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, great sickness prevails, and the fever has the essential symptoms of yellow fever. At Roy∣alton, on White-River, in Vermont, and on the Grand-Isles, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Champlain, the yellow fever prevails with considera∣ble
<PB N="98" REF="035335_0097_1001FEA8B4412AB0"/>
mortality. The disease has the characteristic symptoms of the genuine yellow fever, and terminates fatally in about six days. Royalton is situated on the be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of White-River, on a dry, gravelly soil, but enclosed by very high mountains, which really make the position of the town, a deep valley.</P>
<P>"At Windsor, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Vermont, a similar fever prevails. This is on Connecticut river; the banks of which are high in that neighbourhood, and make little or no marsh; but, the town is almost surrounded by mountains. In such positions, there is a great accumulation of heat, from the reverberated rays of the sun in hot weather; and, in all such situations, the human race are more exposed to autumnal fevers and dysen∣tery, than on hills which overlook the surrounding country."</P>
<P>"Baltimore has happily escaped this year. Their sufferings, in 1797, convinced them of the propriety of an efficient qua∣rantine law, and a strict attention to cleanliness. Their care and their success is a good example to other cities. Their mayor enforced a strict compliance with the ordinance for clearing the gutters, and removing every kind of filth, not only from the streets, but from the houses and lots. He also solicited the different fire-companies, to have their engines fre∣quently exercised in watering the streets. This was complied with, as it was deemed necessary to guard against its domes∣tic generation. On the 10th of August, the Board of Health ordered that all vessels, arriving from any of the West-India islands, laden with certain cargoes, which they particularly specified, should be prohibited by the health-officer from coming up into port; but, that the cargo thereof should be discharged into another vessel, while it remained in the river, and that necessary care should be observed to purify the same, before it should be admitted into the city. Communication between Baltimore and the cities of Philadelphia, New-York, Wilmington, &amp;c. was prohibited, under certain restrictions, by proclamations of the mayor, bearing date August 18th, and September 15th."</P>
<P>The governor of South-Carolina issued a proclamation, di∣recting that all vessels which should arrive at Charleston, from Philadelphia, or any port or place on the river Delaware, should be brought to, under the guns of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort-Johnson, and perform quarantine.</P>
<P>Many other places in the United States adopted similar measures. In the different ports of Great-Britain, our ves∣sels were also obliged to ride quarantine.</P>

<P>"Humanity must surely recoil at the circumstance, but the fact is certain, that a poor, distressed object of human woe, was forcibly landed, on the morning of Friday last, from a vessel, at the public wharf at the hay-scales, in the district of the Northern-Liberties, at 11 o'clock; and lay exposed there, without shelter, the same night, and remained under the de∣bilitating heat of Saturday, until one o'clock, when the poor sufferer expired, without receiving the friendly aid of huma∣nity to support him in the last moments of life. His corpse was afterwards suffered to be interred at the expense of a few charitable citizens.</P>

<P>It is almost impossible to conceive the miseries which some of our unfortunate fellow-mortals were doomed to sus∣tain. We give the following incidents as a picture, though imperfect:</P>
<P>"About the middle of August, a German, a stranger in the place, applied to be admitted into the Pennsylvania Hospi∣tal. His case did not come strictly within their cognizance, and he was refused. He then solicited an entrance into the alms-house; but having the dysentery, and not being entitled to a place of residence there, he was unsuccessful. His next application was to the Health-Officer of the port; but he conceiving himself unauthorized to send him to the City-Hospital, the poor wretch was turned away, without any hope of relief. What became of him, is not known; but
<PB N="100" REF="035335_0099_1002323284474E70"/>
the despondency depicted in his countenance, produced a correspondent sentiment of sympathy in the minds of many, all of whom seemed to regret his unhappy condition, though none knew in what manner to grant him the aid he required."</P>
<P>The body of a man was found in the house of captain Ste∣vens, which was almost ate up by vermin. The family ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> left the house about a month previous. Three days after which, it was opened to get out some goods, and shut up again till the end of September; when a captain Skaidmor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> procured the key to take out a chest. As soon as he opened the door, such an offensive stench issued out of it, as indu∣ced him, and a b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y who accompanied him, to retreat. They were both, shortly after, taken sick. The body was suffered to remain till evening; when two negroes were hired, for sixteen dollars, to throw the corpse into the river. No trace was left to distinguish whether it was the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of a white or of a black man, excepting his having long brown hair.—It is true, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ough very extraordinary, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he family do not know how he got in, nor what soul had possessed the body. They left no person, to their knowledge, in the house. It was well secured, and they found it so. He lay under a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot-bedstead, and had nothing on but a shirt. Even a woman who afterwards cleansed the house, took sick and died.—Hence, a father, a mother, a wife, or perhaps his children, will, daily, hope to find him; but, while this anticipa∣tion may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ull their minds from too-deeply grieving at his loss, no trace remains of him. They do not know that he is gone to "that bou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e from whence no traveller returns."</P>
<P>A man was found dead in a house in Front, near Walnut-street. The corpse was first discovered, by an offensive smell. From the time that elapsed after the family left the house, it is thought, it laid there, at least, a month. It was in so high a state of putrefaction, that it was removed by pieces to the coffin in which it was deposited.</P>
<P>A man was found dead in a fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> who was seen, appa∣rently hearty, only three days previous.</P>
<P>A French gentleman was found dead in a house in Vine, near Front-street. The corpse was discovered only by a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> effluvia. No person lived in the house with him.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="035335_0100_1002325047704C00"/>
A woman was found dead in Water-street. The corpse laid one day before it was discovered. Her young child was alive upon the same bed with her.</P>
<P>The corpse of a woman was found on the commons, also of two men at No. 171, North Second-street.</P>
<P>The corpse of a man was found in Water-street. It was carefully laid out, and wrapped in a sheet, ready for the coffin.</P>
<P>September 23—A person was found dead in Eighth, be∣tween Race and Vine-streets. On the 25th, a child was found dead, on the commons, near Potter's-field. On the 27th, the body of a man was discovered on the wharf below Mr. Wharton's counting-house.</P>
<P>October 16—A dead woman was found in a house at the corner of Eighth and Shippen-streets.</P>
<P>About the 16th of August, a person, passing through Union, between Second and Third-streets, perceived a nox∣ious effluvia, of the nature of that which is emitted by cof∣fee, in a state of putrefaction. He was next day seized with a severe illness, and died in a few days.</P>
<P>About the 24th of August, a person went home in a fright, from having seen a yellow-looking man. He took sick, and died in eight days.</P>
<P>The case of Jane Doron, at the City-Hospital, is some∣what remarkable: She was, to all appearance, dead. A coffin was brought, and other preparations for her interment pursued. But some doubt remained in the mind of Dr. May, the physician. He returned—and, upon examining her bo∣dy, he felt a warmth, near the heart, yet without any palpi∣tation. Urged by this, he then resolved to try his utmost ef∣forts. He began to rub her arm, in order to bring on a pulse by friction. The steward, who was also present, laid hold of the other arm, and followed the example. In two hours, she shewed symptoms of life, first, by a quivering at the region of the heart, and a few hours afterwards, by an hysteric fit, which went off with a copious effusion of tears. She re∣covered.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="035335_0101_100232604853D9E8"/>
Mr. J. Conchy's son died of the calamity. The same day his daughter went to the river to bring water: She fell in, and was drowned.</P>
<P>A person entered the house of Mr. M'P—. He men∣tioned that he had just put a body in a coffin. This alarmed Mrs. M'P—. She immediately took sick. Distress, unusually accumulated, soon followed. Mrs. M'P—and a child were attacked. Mrs. M'P—'s mother and brother went to assist them. They were likewise seized; and all died but Mr. and Mrs. M'P—: nor did distress end here:—Whilst they were in state of convalescence, they were recommended to move to a more airy, and less-infected situ∣ation. On their removal, they hired a white nurse; having previously experienced the negligence of several black ones. But, she proved to be more abandoned. She let in some per∣sons during the night. Their noise alarmed Mr. M'P—, who was but just able to walk. He went to inquire what was going on; but, he found them gone, and fire on the floor in several places. They were robbed of cash, plate, &amp;c.—Even the body-clothes of the two patients, who were in bed, were carried off.</P>
<P>In many families the mortality was general. Three bodies have been taken out of <HI>one</HI> house at <HI>one</HI> time. Whole fami∣lies were, in several instances, swept off. Mr. Wiles's wife died on the 26th of September. By the time the hearse came for the corpse, his son was dead; his journeyman died the same day; next day Mr. Wiles died, and his brother-in-law next day after.</P>
<P>Mr. Scott, a stout, robust man, in delirium, ran into the street in his shirt and night-cap; and walked up several squares, before he was overtaken. A patient made his escape from the Hospital with nothing on but his shirt, and went to his lodgings, in Water-street, (a distance of two miles); when he arrived, he was covered with blood; It was caused by his removing the bandages from the orifice, where he was bled at the Hospital.</P>
<P>The screams of a woman, who died at No. 32, Carter's-alley, were heard to the distance of Strawberry-alley, on the one side, and Dock-street on the other. The wall of the room was sprinkled with blood, that issued from her mouth, upwards of two feet from where her head lay.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="035335_0102_1001FEB7AB6972F8"/>
Some were attacked in the street, others on the commons, and there generally laid till a coach came to carry them to the Hospital.—Drunkards, lying in the street, have also been sent to the Hospital, supposed to have the fever.</P>
<P>Many scenes occurred to the drivers of the sick coachees, which were calculated to soften hearts the most hardened! Fathers and mothers delivered to them their sick children, children their parents, wives their husbands, husbands their wives, &amp;c. &amp;c. but most frequently, masters their servants and landlords their lodgers.</P>
<P>A gentleman who remained in the city during the cala∣mity, principally from an intention of assisting his suffering fellow-creatures, in taking his rounds one morning, met with a man lying in a gutter; who, in his agony, had much bruised himself and torn his cloaths. A number of people at a distance were viewing him; but none ventured to his as∣sistance. His own son had deserted him! Shocking to hu∣manity! Had it not been for the interference of the above gentleman, he must have died, to the reproach of human nature, like a beast! He was removed to the Hospital, where the last moments of this afflicted man were somewhat assuag∣ed by the lenient hand of attention. He lived but a few hours after he was removed from the gutter.</P>
<P>A gentleman of New-Jersey, went to Germantown. When arrived, he felt overcome by heat and fatigue; but, notwithstanding, he transacted his business; and immediate∣ly set off to return home. On his way in the road, which leads from Frankford to Germantown, perceiving a pleasant place under the shade of a tree, he laid down, with an intention of resting himself. Several persons, who passed by, expressed their pity for his situation, supposing him ill with the fever, but took good care to keep on the other side of the road. At length, a lady, with her daughter, who happened to be rid∣ing by, perceived him, and supposing him ill of the fever, ordered her servant to drive up to the fence. The gentle∣man, surprized, raised himself up, and the lady in a sympa∣thizing tone of voice, desired to know if he was unwell. He informed her he was not. But she supposing he was unwil∣ling to confess it, pressed him, that if he had the fever, and no friends near, she would take him to her house, which was close by, and nurse him herself. The gentleman, im∣pressed
<PB N="104" REF="035335_0103_10023274A37CD6C0"/>
with gratitude, arose, thanked her, and declared that he was only fatigued, and had not been in Philadelphia.</P>
<P>A person from Philadelphia, travelling in west New-Jersey, stopped at the house of Mr. Craig, a miller, where he was attacked with the fever: he died in a few days. During his ill∣ness, he was nursed by Mrs. Craig both day and night, who would not let any others go nigh him. She remained with him till he died, and even assisted to lay him in a coffin.</P>
<P>A woman of Wilmington, after losing one of her fami∣ly with the fever that raged there, fled with her five children to the house of her father, a few miles from Chester.—He possesses a large house, farm, &amp;c. On their approach, her father's house-keeper came to the gate, and forbid them to enter, at the same time fastened it. The fugitives took shelter in a school-house, nearly opposite, and received daily support, for near three weeks, from the neighbours generally, the father's family excepted.</P>
<P>During the height of the calamity, it was difficult to pro∣cure nurses. The hire was from one to five dollars per day! Richard Allen and William Gray, two men of colour, were very serviceable in assisting to procure nurses. They recom∣mended none but those whom they supposed could be trusted.</P>
<P>A young man, of the name of Henry Bullyberger, of Phi∣ladelphia, moved to Upper-Providence, Delaware county, about fifteen miles from Philadelphia. Contrary to the in∣junctions of his friends, he secretly visited Philadelphia to see his relations. He went to the Hospital burying-ground: he there saw seventeen interred. His sister and her husband, whom he visited, took the fever, with himself, who all died in the space of nine days.</P>
<P>Many facts appear, which evidence that the yellow fever is contagious in country places, distant from tide-water, marshes, &amp;c. In Germantown, the infection was, in several cases, communicated from one to another.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER From a gentleman of experience and respectability, TO THE EDITORS.</HEAD>
<P>I APPROVE your design of publishing a history of the ma∣lignant fever which has ravaged our city, and divers other parts of America. I hope it will be useful to the citizens of the United States, and profitable to yourselves. Such light as may be in my power to throw upon this subject, you shall have. I propose, therefore, to answer your queries accord∣ing to the best of my judgment, in the order you have sta∣ted them.</P>
<P>Query I. "Is it" (the disease) "of domestic origin, or imported? If one, or the other, be pleased to state the rea∣sons for your opinion."</P>
<P>Answer. I believe the disease, this year, as in the years '93 and '97, to have been imported; and, I will add, contagious: (this being still doubted by some, and denied by others). My reasons are as follow. In the years '93 and '97, the disorder broke out near the river, and spread, with remarkable regula∣rity, up and down the river; going from house to house and from street to street, until it extended, from the river, quite to the westward part of the city. In the present year, it appeared in several parts of the city, distant from each other, nearly at the same time: From this circumstance, those gentlemen who had entertained a belief that the dis∣ease we had in '93 and '97 was of domestic origin, appear∣ed confirmed in their opinion; and concluded that others,
<PB N="ii" REF="035335_0109_100232C2179DCAA8"/>
must now agree with them, that the disease, both then and now, originated in this city. If the regular manner in which the disorder spread over the city, in the years '93 and '97, fur∣nished an argument in favour of its being imported and con∣tagious, so does the manner in which it appeared among us in the present year, furnish an argument, equally strong, that it was imported and contagious. Its spreading over the whole city, in the present year, has been as uniform as it was before; although it appeared in different parts of it nearly at the same time. Two flat-men, who lodged near the sign of the Cross-Keys, were among the first who died of this disorder. Two young men, of the names of Ralston and Beaty, lodged together near the hay-scales, up town; they had worked on board the ship Deborah; were both seized with the fever, and died. A young man, of the name of Is∣dell, came from Burlington, went on board the Deborah to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an acquaintance, was soon after seized with the fever, and died. Doctor Kheimly attended a young man who died with the fever; the Doctor was informed this man belong∣ed to the Deborah. A young man, who belonged to the fa∣mily of the gentleman who owned the Deborah, died of the fever. It has been repeatedly asserted, that Ely Shoemaker, and 'squire Servoss, were on board the Deborah; they died of the fever. A gentleman, who lives at Kensington, has as∣sured me, that they were in health until the Deborah was taken there, to be repaired; that several of the carpenters, who worked on board her, were seized with the fever and died; and, from them, it spread through the place. Doctor Ben∣newell happened to be near this vessel when she was there; he was soon after seized with the fever; it spread through his family, and some of them died. It is asserted, that a man, of the name of Philips, who lived in Water-street, between Walnut-street and the Draw-bridge, went down the river and brought up one, or more sick men, from the Deborah; they died: Philips was seized with the disease, and died.—About the same time, the disorder appeared in the family of the next neighbour of Philips, and soon after, in divers other places in the south part of the city, all of which could have been traced to the neighbourhood where Philips had died. It now made its appearance up town, about the hay-scales, where Ralston and Beaty, who had worked on board the Deborah, died; and at the Cross-Keys, where two shallop∣men had died. In consequence of my profession, as an apo∣thecary, and persons coming from various parts of the town
<PB N="iii" REF="035335_0110_100232C923C6D810"/>
for medicine, I had an opportunity of discovering that, al∣though the disease raged violently in many parts of the city at the same time, yet there were many other parts en∣tirely free from complaint; but, by degrees, the healthy parts diminished in magnitude, and the sickly parts increased un∣til they met; after which, again, and before the disease had searched out every part of the town, some parts, where the disorder had raged violently, became free from disease; whilst other parts of the town were visited that before had been healthy. Near thirty persons have died in a few hou∣ses, opposite this city, in the Jerseys. The case of the vessel, mentioned in the newspapers, sailing from this city to City-Point, in Virginia, is a striking proof of the contagion of this disease; from this vessel the disorder spread, and great numbers of the inhabitants died. About 12 persons, who came to the annual meeting of the Friends, died. A man came from Wilmington to this city; was in Water-street, near Philips's; was taken ill soon after he returned home, and died. Some∣time after, a quantity of rags, for a paper-maker, was sent from this city to Wilmington; several young persons, who handled them, were taken ill and died: from them, some say, it spread.</P>
<P>Those who hold that the disorder is of domestic origin, have said that many places have been visited with as great mortality, in proportion to their numbers, as this city; and who have had no intercourse with any place, so as to have taken the disorder by infection; that the first who died among them, had never been from home. This has been asserted by some, and contradicted by others. It would be an arduous task to ascertain the facts, neither is it material. If this should even be granted, it does by no means prove what is endeavoured to be inferred from it. If handling a few rags communicated the disease, as at Wilmington, and opening a chest of clothes, as was the case at Bordentown, might not the disorder have been carried, in some such way, where it has been supposed to have originated, and at the same time unnoticed? Has it not been frequently carried in bales of goods and clothing, from one country to another? Is it then to be wondered at, that it should appear in some places where its communication could not be traced or ac∣counted for?</P>
<P>In the year '94, this city, Boston and New-London, were clear of the disease; and New-York and Baltimore, were af∣flicted with it: In the present year, this city, New-York,
<PB N="iv" REF="035335_0111_100232CAB1578BC8"/>
Boston, New-London, and other places, have had it, and Baltimore was healthy. Now, it is scarcely possible that an epi∣demical disease, originating in some peculiar state of the at∣mosphere, could appear so singular. What extraordinary phaenomenon has appeared, in the elements, to produce such astonishing effects? Had some deadly exhalation arisen from the bowels of the earth—or such a blast of air, as, at times, appears in some parts of the world, where men are suddenly smitten with disease—had the heavens assumed an appearance very unusual, we might, then, have had some reason to conclude this disorder of domestic origin; but when the weather has been remarkably serene and pleasant—when the inhabitants of Philadelphia and Baltimore all breathe the same common air (unless, indeed, at Baltimore it is less salubrious)—that, at the same time, a most mortal epidemic, as it is called, should visit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s, and they all enjoy good health! This cannot be: The disease we have had among us, I believe, has arisen from no such cause. It is the opinion of some gentlemen of the faculty, that coffee and grain, in a state of putrefaction, will generate a putrid fever; but they do not agree in saying, how far such a fever is contagious: Some, who admit that they would generate a putrid fever, deny such a fever would be contagious; others do not admit that a putrid fever would arise from such a cause. If coffee or grain, in a state of pu∣trefaction, will, at any time, generate a contagious putrid fever, it will at all times do so, the state of the atmosphere being the same, because the operations of nature are uni∣formly alike; but, among the farmers and millers in Ame∣rica, no instances of the kind has appeared.</P>
<P>The late doctor Chauvett, who had resided many years in the West-Indies, always gave it as his opinion, that the fe∣ver, commonly called the West-India fever, from its pre∣vailing there, was not natural to the climate, but was impor∣ted from Africa. Doctor Letsom, of London, in a letter to a gentleman of the faculty in this city, informs him, that a vessel sailed from Africa in the year '93, and arrived in the West-Indies, having a malignant fever on board; that this fever spread among the king's troops with great mortality; that one remarkable circumstance attending the disease was, that those who died seldom survived the fifth day. It is now further well known, that, from the year '93 to the present time, the fever in the West-Indies has been worse than usu∣al. A master of a vessel, who has sailed to the West-Indies for some years past, assured me, that, in the year '96, he lay
<PB N="v" REF="035335_0112_100232CF96C5B258"/>
near a British man of war of 74 guns, that the fever appea∣red among the crew, and that 30 persons were buried from her in twenty-four hours. A medical gentleman, with whom I am acquainted, has further informed me, that he was on the coast of Africa, in the year 1788, when the ves∣sels that were there, had on board a disease resembling the one we have had, in all respects. We see, then, in the year '88, this disorder was in Africa; doctor Letsom has tra∣ced it from Africa to Philadelphia, in the year '93; and that it has been in the West-Indies from '93 to the present year. Is it not then more than probable, that it has been repeat∣edly brought from thence to the United States of America?</P>
<P>That this disease is the plague, or a plague, is evident, if we attend to the symptoms and circumstances attending it. In the first place, great prostration of strength attended the sick from the first attack; some died in a few hours after they were taken ill; many died within 24 hours after; but generally on the fifth day. Many were raving and distrac∣ted, and would have got away from their nurses if they could. They frequently bled at the mouth and nose, and died with the black vomit. There is a great resemblance, in other respects, between the disease we have had, and those plagues which has visited other countries.</P>
<P>Under the article of plague, in the Encyclopedia, we are told of a plague that killed scarc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> any women, and very few except lusty men. Another plague, mentioned by Boterus, which assaulted none but the younger sort. Cardon speaks of a plague at Basil, with which the Switzers were infected, and the Italians, Germans and French, exempted; and a dreadful one at Copenhagen, which, though it raged among the Danes, spared the Germans, Dutch and English, who went with all freedom, and without the least danger, to the houses of the infected. During the plague which ravaged Syria in 1760, it was observed, that people of the soundest constitutions were the most liable to it, and that the weak and delicate were either spared, or easily cured: it was most fatal to the Moors; when it attacked them, it was, generally, incurable.</P>
<P>The disease we had in the years '93 and 97 was more mor∣tal among men than women; and was still more so among the strong and vigorous than among the weak and delicate; and rarely attacked any under 14 years of age; the West-Indians escaped it altogether. In the present year, it seems to have seized all ages and both sexes, except the West-In∣dians,
<PB N="vi" REF="035335_0113_100232D7756D0080"/>
and they have escaped it as heretofore; persons lately from Europe took it readily, and it was generally mortal.</P>
<P>From the foregoing resemblance between the plague, which has desolated other countries, and the sickness we have had, we may safely pronounce it a plague. If, then, this is its proper appellation, it has not generated in Ameri∣ca; no cause, adequate to the generating such a disease, hav∣ing appeared among us. To say that the elements have un∣dergone some extraordinary change, is merely an assertion that does not appear to have any foundation. Is there not a great degree of uniformity in the temperature of the air and elements, from Massachusetts-Bay to Virginia? and, yet, how different has been the fate of the inhabitants, in particu∣lar places, between the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and the other. What salubrity in the air and elements has Baltimore been blessed with be∣yond Philadelphia, New-York, Boston, and other places in the present year, and which it was deprived of in the year '94, and Philadelphia enjoyed in preference?</P>
<P>The foregoing are reasons to induce me to believe the disease we have had, was not an epidemical disease, occasioned by any peculiar state of the atmosphere, nor occasioned by any stagnated filth in or near, our city. The disorder we have had is no less than a plague; and, as no sufficient cause has appeared to generate a plague, so, of consequence, it must have been imported.</P>
<P>It is generally agreed that the plague was never bred, or propagated, in Britain; but was always imported there: and if it be so, may we not, with as much reason, conclude it was never bred or generated in America? I do not say this is impossible, but only contend it hath never yet happened, although we have had a disease, in the last war, approaching thereto, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the camp fever.</P>
<P>To what cause, then, shall we attribute the origin of such a disease? Not to a few bags of damaged coffee, or vegetable substances, in a state of putrefaction; this, in my opinion, would not do it. Although persons approaching such a source of polluted air might get a fever, yet I cannot believe such a fever would be contagious. My suspicions are, that this disease takes its origin from human nature.</P>
<P>There are frequent plagues among the brute creation, and which are confined to one particular species. I suspect, then, that those plagues originate in some peculiar manner among the particular species which are afflicted, whether dogs, cats, horses, or horned cattle. Plagues, therefore,
<PB N="vii" REF="035335_0114_100232DA94D10678"/>
among men, originate not by means of damaged grain, cof∣fee, or any vegetable substances, in a state of putrefaction; but by means of human nature in a state of peculiar disease, death and putrefaction. A number of persons crouded to∣gether, in a narrow apartment, although in perfect health, will soon generate a disease; and it will be more malignant the longer they are confined. A large encampment, if pro∣visions are bad, and the men not kept clean, and impurities not removed, will generate disease—these are the jail and camp fever, and resemble a plague in some degree; but to render them so virulent, as to become highly contagious, for they are contagious in some degree, it may possibly re∣quire that most offensive and deadly exhalation, which arise from the human corps in a state of putrefaction; this com∣bination of causes, together with a particular state of the atmosphere, produces, as I suppose, what is properly, and distinguishedly, called the plague. This effluvia operates upon persons of a peculiar habit of body, as a poisonous lea∣ven, so as speedily to reduce them to that state of disease, in which they transmit the same pestilential miasmata, as per∣sons in the small-pox, and some other diseases, propagate the same disease. I have either read, or heard, of a plague, arising from a grave having been opened, when the corps was in a state of putrefaction; the grave-digger being first seized, and dying; from him it spread. That such a cause might produce a malignant fever, there is no doubt; how far it would be contagious, depends upon known facts: that the jail and camp fevers are contagious, in some degree, is true; and that human corps, in a state of putrefaction, will com∣municate a malignant and putrid fever, is also true; that they may unite together, and, under a peculiar state of the atmos∣phere, constitute a malignant, putrid and contagious fever, is almost certain; and I very much doubt whether any thing short of either one or other-of those causes, or these combined, would produce such a fever. We are told, that an immense swarm of locusts dying has occasioned a plague. I do not doubt the story; yet I do not believe that this disease was conta∣gious or catching from man to man; an immense number of locusts, in a state of putrefaction, might contaminate the air, so as to render it almost fatal for any person to breathe it. Thousands might die from such a cause; yet this is a different thing from contagion; every man being seized with such a sickness, derives his disorder immediately from a great mass of contaminated air; but a contagious, putrid fever is
<PB N="viii" REF="035335_0115_100232E420DE69D8"/>
where the disease communicates an effluvia; which, being received by persons of a peculiar habit of body, produces, in them, the same disease. It is highly probable, as I have before observed, that every contagious disease with which mankind are afflicted, arises from some peculiar cause among the species.</P>
<P>Those gentlemen who believe the disease we have had was neither imported nor contagious, advance the following reasons, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that very few of those who nursed in the dis∣ease took it; and many others escaped who were much ex∣posed to the contagion, and that it did not spread in the country. It is, indeed, one consoling circumstance attending the disease, that there did not appear that danger in nursing in it, as might have been apprehended from so malignant a disease; but it does not therefore follow that it is not, or was not, contagious. It is true, there are some persons of that peculiar habit of body which do not take the disease, let them be ever so much exposed to it; were not this the case, the world would soon be depopulated.</P>
<P>It has been said, that some of those who nursed at the hospital, in the midst of great contagion, enjoyed their health; but leaving the hospital, and coming into town, they caught the disorder. From this, it is inferred, that the dis∣ease was not contagious in itself; but that the danger arose from the peculiar state of the atmosphere in the city. Ad∣mitting the facts to be as above stated, I account for the nurses escaping the sickness at the hospital, and taking it in the city, upon other principles. The hospital is a building which stands alone, and well aired, and was kept clean; the miasmata, arising from the sick, was speedily extinguished, or carried away by the free admission of the air: this, to∣gether with the contiguous vegetation, and the salubrious ex∣halations arising therefrom, rendered it much safer, than where buildings erected, with brick, are crowded together, and the streets paved. By those means, the air must have been much more disposed to spread contagion, and to add virulency to the disease.</P>
<P>I have now answered your query with respect to the ori∣gin of the disorder, and, have further given you some reasons why I believe it to be contagious, many others might be ad∣vanced.</P>
<P>2dly, You request to be informed of "the time when the first case appeared, and where?"</P>
<P>On the 2d of July, Mark Miller died, as has been re∣ported,
<PB N="ix" REF="035335_0116_100232EDD1B01380"/>
with the usual symptoms of the yellow fever. And us this case could not be traced to any vessel from the West-Indies, it has been used as an argument in favour of its do∣mestic origin: But, it is said, the bed on which he slept, at his lodgings in Callowhill-street, was one on which a young man laid, while he had the yellow fever in the year '97. If this be true, as I believe the disease to be of the pestilential kind, it accounts for his having taken the disorder, and points out the necessity of well cleansing houses. There were di∣vers other persons who died in the month of June and July, (whose names I have forgot) with symptoms, as it was said, very much resembling the yellow fever; and those gentle∣men who hold that the fever originated among us, advance these cases as additional arguments in favour of their hypo∣thesis: But, might they not have died in consequence of contagion remaining, either in beds or cloathing from the preceding year, or from some vessels from the West Indies? for, the disease is there, and no doubt has been brought by other vessels besides the Deborah and Mary; or might not those persons have died of a billious fever, such as that which sometimes prevails in the summer season, which is not con∣tagious, yet, in its symptoms, is very much like the malig∣nant fever we have had among us? It may be said, that if those persons had received the disorder either by a vessel from the West-Indies, from pestilential miasmata, remaining in beds or cloathing, the disorder would have spread from them over the city. This does not follow, neither. There is no doubt but that a certain pre-disposition, in the air, is ne∣cessary, in order for it to spread, and a pre-disposition of body also to receive it. A warm summer produces this effect: it both renders the atmosphere disposed to spread the disease, and the habits of bodies among the people to receive it, and also it may require the summer season to produce this effect, so as for it to spread generally, yet some individuals may take it earlier. This sentiment seems corroborated from a great number having had the disorder since it has generally aba∣ted; for, as some have taken the disorder since the weather has been so favourable as to have very much extinguished it, so some might have taken it from previous contagion, be∣fore the season was such as to promote a general infection.</P>
<P>Your third query is, "What were the general appear∣ances of the disease? Were they any way different from the year '93." Answer. The general appearances of the disease
<PB N="x" REF="035335_0117_100232EFA4A2A598"/>
so nearly resembled the appearances in the year '93, as evi∣dently shewed it to be the same disease, yet more malignant and mortal. In the year '93, scarce any took the disorder under 14 or 15 years of age: it was less mortal among wo∣men than men. In the present year, it has been very mortal among all ages, and both sexes.</P>
<P>4th. You query, "What were the successful modes of treatment? did they differ from former practice?"</P>
<P>Answer. The most successful mode of treating this disor∣der, appeared to be, either by salivating the patient as spee∣dily as possible, or by promoting a copious sweat, on the first symptoms appearing; then to open the body well, and by keeping it open with moderate purges, and frequent clystering. Altho' the lancet was not so frequently used as heretofore, yet, in some cases, it was, in my opinion, very proper. The regimen should be of the cooling kind; such as that generally known and practised in malignant fevers. If the patient should be seized with a pain in the stomach, which is sometimes the case, and it is an unfavourable symptom, I have known extraordinary good effects produced by fomenting the part with a decoction of flaxseed. There is no disease which depends more upon the nurse; for, if your physician is ever so skilful, if your nurse is inatten∣tive, you may, nevertheless, lose your friend; and, it is on this account, that this disease has been more mortal than otherwise it would have been. I have been informed by a young man, who nursed in the disorder, at Wilmington, that the mortality was considerably less among those who were laid under tents, and upon the ground, with only straw under them, than among those who were attended in the usual way in dwelling houses.</P>
<P>5th. You query, "Was the disease in any cases infec∣tious, when carried into the country, distant from tide-wa∣ter?"</P>
<P>Answer. This disease was infectious at Germantown: eight or ten persons took it in two or three families. This disorder will be most mortal in cities that are large, and po∣pulous, (whether they are on tide-water or not,) on account of houses depriving each other of a free admission and cir∣culation of the air, the encreased heat of cities, and their being deprived of the salubrity of vegetation, and the occu∣pation of many citizens confining them within doors.</P>
<P>6th. You ask, "What estimate do you make of the num∣ber
<PB N="xi" REF="035335_0118_100232F50B625268"/>
who have died in the country? How long were they out? Or whether, with them, it assumed such fatal or vio∣lent appearances as here?"</P>
<P>Answer. I have taken no pains to ascertain the numbers who have died in the country; but they are much greater than the numbers were in the year '93; neither have I taken any pains to ascertain what length of time they were out. With respect to those who were seized with the disorder in the country, it appeared to be as fatal as in the city, although it did not spread as it did in the city: the reason for which, I conceive to be, country houses are better aired, and the advantages they have of the salubrious effects of vegetation.</P>
<P>7thly. "What are the best means of preventing its intro∣duction or generation, or to prevent its attack, when gene∣rated, besides that of flight?"</P>
<P>Answer. As this disorder is unquestionably imported from the West-Indies, the best means of preventing its introduc∣tion is, to stop all trade there for a few months in the year; or to oblige vessels to perform a more effectual quarantine than has been observed heretofore. The best way to pre∣vent an attack of the disease, when introduced among us, besides that of flight, is, to keep your person and your habi∣tation sweet and clean, use moderate exercise in the open air, not to stand still in the sun, and avoid taking cold; to live temperately, yet by no means too abstemiously, nor to take purgatives by way of prevention; and, above all things, to acquire, if possible, a magnanimous mind that does not fear death. I know of no better preventatives than the fore∣going; yet, as the disease is the plague, I believe many would take it, if exposed to the contagion, let them use whatever precaution they may.</P>
<P>8thly. "What are the best means of cleansing houses, clothes, &amp;c. of the infected, and of destroying contagion?".</P>
<P>Answer. Gunpowder slashed in an infected room will ex∣pel the foul air, and replace it with air free from conta∣gion; but, that every closet and crevice may be searched, shut your room close up, stop the fire-place, set a pan of coals in the middle of the room, on which throw a quantity of brimstone, and fill your room with the fumes; or, take a handful of common salt, or salt-petre, and with it, about half a pound of oil of vitriol, hanging, at the same time, wear∣ing apparel, or any other article which you may apprehend is infected, in the room. These fumes will penetrate every thing thoroughly, and cleanse them from infection. Linens
<PB N="xii" REF="035335_0119_100232FC1686A9A0"/>
may be cleansed by steeping them in ley, and woolens in soap suds. White-wash your walls with lime, and wash your floors with ley. To bury an infected article in the ground ten days will cleanse it.</P>
<P>9thly. "Are there any particular classes of persons more subject to it than others."</P>
<P>Answer. It appears that some persons are more liable to take it than others. In this respect, it corresponds with some other plagues which have appeared at different times. I know of no instance of a West-Indian taking the disorder, although there was many in the city during the whole sick∣ness. Europeans have taken it very readily, and it has been generally mortal among them. Of the Americans in the year '93, I know of but few who took it under 14 or 15 years of age, and as I have observed before, it was more mortal among men than women; and it has been more mortal then and the present year, among the robust and sanguinary, than among persons of a spare habit of body. Of hard drinkers, scarce one in twenty have recovered.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE EDITORS OF THE HISTORY OF THE YELLOW FEVER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE received your circular letter of the 9th of No∣vember, containing queries relative to the epidemic, which lately ravaged our city and other places on this continent. The good that may result from your undertaking is obvious, if it only contributes to propagate those opinions which will lead us to efficacious measures for the preservation of a great population. Many old countries have protected them∣selves against plagues and malignant fevers, and why should we not imitate their improvements to obtain the same bless∣ings? I have now but little to say on the various topics of so interesting a subject, yet, I think it is the duty of every in∣dividual,
<PB N="xiii" REF="035335_0120_100232FDA3D1E818"/>
to submit to the public any observation that he may deem conducive to relieve us from one of the greatest cala∣mities. That duty I endeavoured to fulfil last year, and I would be obliged to repeat what I have already published, if I were to answer all your queries. I shall, however, content myself with a few observations that have occurred during one year more of experience.</P>
<P>"<HI>Is the yellow fever of domestic origin?</HI>" Men wishing for spe∣culative demonstration, might perhaps be satisfied with what has been already said in the affirmative of this question, and chiefly by the opinion of the majority of the learned in the United States; but, if a proof of another kind is acceptable—a proof of fact and of experimental demonstration, such a proof has been offered to me by a singular circumstance; and I beg your readers will weigh it with impartiality, while their candour will require no further evidence than that which is in the power of one witness to give.</P>
<P>A gentleman from a foreign country, who arrived during our late epidemic, informed me, that although he was quite healthy, and had lived many years in one of the West-In∣dia islands, he did experience a disagreeable impression from our atmosphere chiefly during the first days of his ar∣rival; and that he had even felt some fever, which just∣ly alarmed him. In consequence, he fixed his residence at two miles distant from town, where he never suffered any kind of indisposition; yet, as he frequently came into the city, he then always discovered that our atmosphere was impregnat∣ed with corrupted effluvia, which he could assimilate to no∣thing better than to the effluvia from rotten wood. This ef∣fect was very surprising to him; for he admired the regula∣rity and the cleanliness of this town in general. I answered, that if I could add to his observation a greater evidence than that of a single individual, I could derive from it a convinc∣ing proof, that the origin of our epidemic was a contagion abundantly floating in our atmosphere, and incessantly re∣newed in it. It was obvious to suppose that this gentleman was endowed with a particular degree of acuteness in his olfactory organs, which power, however, is not very uncom∣mon, and which many among us do not perceive, being ac∣customed to live in a vitiated atmosphere. But how could an imported disorder produce such an alteration in it? Are not populous towns in Europe productive of much more corrupt∣ed vapours, than those that can arise from a few patients scattered about? and yet none of them, except in the Le∣vant,
<PB N="xiv" REF="035335_0121_10023301C98ABFC0"/>
are productive of pestilence. Moreover, all the houses here, few excepted, were shut up during the last prevalence, and almost none could produce the usual share of corruption which must continually arise from inhabited places. It rested with me to collect as much evidence as I could of an important fact, because the assertion of the above gentleman extended to all the minutes which he passed in town, and at every time of his coming into it from the house where he lodged in the country. It was consequently agreed between us that he would submit to a trial, by which I could render both his unprejudiced veracity, and the acuteness of his smelling pow∣er, unquestionable proofs of an existing contagion in our at∣mosphere. I then desired him to come with me, while I visited my patients. If I stopped at any place or house where there was no sick, I would leave to him to discriminate whether effluvia or corrupted miasma could be smelled in the neighbourhood or in the entries around. This observation was very difficult to make; but I thought it could not be im∣possible to a man who could distinguish such alterations in the atmosphere: it was besides grounded on the opinion and the fact of noxious vapours sensibly arising from the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds or bodies of patients in the yellow fever, and possibly diffusing at a great distance. The man accepted the task, and fulfilled it wonderfully well. At every place where I stopped or went in, he was able to tell whether a patient was in it or not: he could also discover when I had put myself too much in contact with the sick. But I objected that the contagi∣ous miasma, which he perceived so strongly in the neigh∣bourhood and in the houses of the sick, might be supposed to be the cause of the corrupted vapours, which he had ob∣served in the atmosphere. He could not think so, he said, because they were quite different, and he was now smelling a new sort of human or animal putrefaction which he had not yet in any degree smelled in the general currents of the air, within the avenues and the streets of the city. For a last trial, I took with me a clean white pocket handkerchief, and left it a few minutes in the bed of a patient. I wrapped it up again in a sheet of paper. At the first interview with the gentleman, I suddenly unfolded it, and shook it in his presence, and pretty near him, when he suddenly complain∣ed of my diffusing very strong and corrupted vapours, such as he had smelled before at my patients' houses. I finally remained satisfied of the extreme acuteness of the senses of the observer, and of his veracity in ascertaining that our
<PB N="xv" REF="035335_0122_100233041C7B3AB0"/>
atmosphere was contaminated with corrupted vapours. That the air is constantly renewed and purified of any kind of im∣pure emanations, even without wind, is a fact that experi∣ence teaches us, in every populous town, and at any season of the year; but, such effects cannot take place, when the local sources of corruption, as the wharves, &amp;c. are in a con∣tinual fermentation. This was doubtless the case of Phila∣delphia. Then, it is not surprising, that our atmosphere should bread fevers, contagion and death!</P>
<P>To unprejudiced people, it will appear impossible that an imported disorder could contaminate the whole atmosphere during three months, and when so few people remain in it.</P>
<P>The other point to which I may advert, in answer to your letter, is the proportion of those who recovered by the be∣nefit of medical art, and by the method of treatment which has been generally employed by the greatest number of our physicians. In giving such estimate, however, I wholly co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣fine it within my own opinion, and those of a few medical friends. Owing to the greater degree of malignancy of the last epidemic, it should seem that the success of our prac∣tice has not surpassed that of the year '97, although the best remedies were more generally employed. It is true, that it is the peculiar character of a contagious disorder to increase its deplorable effects in proportion to the degree of alarm that it spreads; for, patients altogether given up to the most shock∣ing despair, and destitute of proper assistance, must necessa∣rily soon become victims of the sickness. These considera∣tions, oblige us, gentlemen, to limit our reckoning among or from the patients who were timely and properly assisted; and of those, I think, that six recovered out of seven. If it was made known that this just and true proportion of the sick reco∣vered by more respectable authorities than that of an indivi∣dual, instead of so many dreadful accounts of deaths incessantly published, certainly the people at large would at least be sup∣ported by a consoling and relieving hope, and in fact, they would be more careful of themselves; for, those who cannot conveniently remove from the seat of the infection, would be more attentive in procuring medical assistance, for which they apply too late or not at all, for want of confidence in its remedies, and because they are not at all apprised of their effectual applications. I shall also take the liberty to suggest, that the public authority might easily obviate the disadvantage of the absence of many of our regular physicians, by granting to those who choose to remain in the infected places, the
<PB N="xvi" REF="035335_0123_1002330A8569CDA0"/>
means of attending as many patients as they could, if they are not used to keep the accommodation of a carriage.</P>
<P>One objection may be made against the above proportion of the patients recovered under the help of medical art, if we attend, without explanation, to a comparative statement on that subject, published by the health office, the 21st of Sep∣tember. So it stood;
<TABLE>

<CELL>1424</CELL>
</ROW>
</TABLE></P>
<P>The health office was solicitously impelled to publish <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> above statement, in order to convince the people, that there was a great danger for them to stay in town, and that the assistance prepared for them in the city-hospital was far bet∣ter than any they could procure in the city: in all respects that intention was laudable; and, in many, the consequences were true; but it behoves a physician to explain, why such a great number as the half of the sick died in the hospital, and why three-fourths have fallen victims in town.</P>
<P>I never granted to a sick person an order for admission in∣to the city-hospital, but I lamented that it was too late, be∣cause one or two days had been lost, by the patient indulging himself in the opinion, that his case was not the yellow fe∣ver, or trying some remedies recommended by their neigh∣bours; or foolishly delaying to take a resolution, which igno∣rance and prejudice rendered very painful to every one of them. To that delay, one or two days were added before the patient would be admitted into the hospital, owing to ne∣glect in transmitting the order to the officers of the board of health, or to the want of some body who could be sent for the carriage, or to accidental delays of other kinds. Thus, it may be justly observed, to the honour of the physi∣cians employed in the city-hospital, that most of the patients they received were taken sick three or four, and many four or five days previous to their admission; yet, at that time, they had cured half of them.</P>
<P>We were in town witnesses to almost the same neglects, delays, and prejudices, among the sick who called for bur as∣sistance. Many refused to be sent to the hospital, who died destitute of nurses and the most necessary remedies; while they surely were not benefited by our atmosphere. They
<PB N="xvii" REF="035335_0124_1002331187FC01A0"/>
were also injured by the heat, narrowness and uncleanliness of their houses and clothes. As the yellow fever has often the surprising effect of suspending any kind of painful sensa∣tion, many felt as if nothing of consequence ailed them, till the approach of death. If, on the contrary, they were attacked with violent symptoms, they were abandoned even by their nearest relations; but few charitable and judicious nurses could be found; of the remaining physicians, many were sick and con∣fined. In short, I have seen about sixty or seventy patients, all of the above description; the greatest part died; and it surely will be granted, that if they had received proper assistance, the greater part must have recovered; and, for the truth and justness of these observations, I can, I believe, with confidence, call upon the candor and experience of the other physicians. It will then be understood, why so many patients died in town with the yellow fever, without derogating from the estimate I have given of those who recovered under medical assistance.</P>
<P>Every body is now investigating what are the best means of preventing the return of that calamity. We must congra∣tulate ourselves on the laudable and numerous exertions of our fellow citizens. The introduction of pure waters, will, no doubt, prove one of the most beneficial improvements; for, it equally answers the purpose of cleansing the streets, as refreshing the atmosphere. The poor people also will have an easier and more convenient means for washing their clothes, which they are used to keep dirty, during the summer, until they can gather some rain water; but that is not all: many other causes did appear to me very obnoxious to the wholesom∣ness of the town. The casements and logs of our wharves are old, and their surface is rotten; at low water, when a scorching sun dries them up, they produce very infecting and dangerous effluvia. The vicinity of the docks has always appeared to be the seat of many deaths; because, at the periodical return of the tide, their filthy waters are also returned, and the most corrupt∣ed and black mud is left again on the bottom. Too many crow∣ded buildings are unfortunately erected upon the wharves. The whole east side of Philadelphia is walled by a double, thick and high range of houses, through which the air has but few streets opened to circulate. The conveniencies of the shipping and mercantile business, have thus deprived the metropolis of the refreshing and moist currents of air, that must necessarily rise from one of the largest rivers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are about ten thousand houses in Philadelphia; the ground also contains ten thousand deep ditches <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> privy necessa∣ries: many of them contain the animal filth of several genera∣tions, and, for the cleaning of them, no law was enacted; no means were provided! Quere-Is not the number of privy ditches, and the cubic solidity of this filth, in a proportionate ratio for the corrup∣tion of all our waters, and for poisoning every point of exhalation on our ground?</NOTE>. The
<PB N="xviii" REF="035335_0125_10023316376BCA38"/>
streets of the suburbs, and many of the city, are left in a surprising state of degradation, and without pavement, while the numerous carriages and great intercourse with the coun∣try, render them still worse; no declivity is given to their waters; no police law is enacted to compel the inhabitants to clean their foot-ways. There the rains, and the common sewers of houses, empty, form ponds, and cover the surface with a thick stratum of animal and vegetable putrefaction. There is nobody in those parts, and even South street, who could not, when he pleases, manure his little garden with the black mud which surrounds them. I never could think, gen∣tlemen, as many do, that the numerous burying-grounds in∣closed in the city, were of no bad consequence. I believe quite the reverse, and I supported it in my account of the yellow fever in '97, by reasons and arguments which I do not think easy to refute. All those burying-grounds are situated on the most elevated points of the city; and as the highest part of the city is forty feet above the river, and as the ditches are dug only six feet deep, I calculate that the bed of all our dead, lie between 20 and 30 feet above the lowest ground. How many streets, consequently, and how many cellars are lower than the lowest bottom of a burying-ground? I ask now, whether the constant moisture and vapour of the ground can be infiltrated from any where but from the high sur∣rounding parts, and whether waters washing thousands of dead bodies, renewed every year, do not retain the most noxious particles, although these waters, under the whole ground of Philadelphia, do circulate through the most ho∣mogeneous clay.</P>
<P>These are, gentlemen, the points of observation which have constantly fixed my opinion, on the origin of our ma∣lignant fever; from which nothing now can preserve us, ex∣cept a cool summer, and frequent N. W. winds. Other re∣medies or preventatives against such a calamity, will, I hope, be found in the liberality and experience of our enlightened fellow-citizens; but it would be useless to stress upon any other conjecture or hypothesis. It was always known, and never ob∣jected but here, that the vicinity of effluvia from corrupted
<PB N="xix" REF="035335_0126_1002331955CE2F10"/>
animal or vegetable substances were pestilential, and produc∣ed fatal diseases; and whenever such sources of contagion surround us, and exist with us, it would be injudicious to dwell upon mere suppositions; for the importion of a fever will always be a supposed doctrine, since it is generally grant∣ed, that during the heat of summer, the same causes can pro∣duce it on board of vessels, at sea or in our ports, and often car∣ries off the whole of their crews. It is also very extraordina∣ry, that we should receive, by importation, a disorder which proves so terrible among us, while it is but occasionally in the countries from where we dread to receive it, and where it is hardly thought contagious, and never threatens, to an alarming degree the population nor the prosperity of the inhabitants.</P>

<HEAD>Letter to Thomas Mifflin, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>. Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, From the Academy of Medicine of Philadelphia, on the origin and means of preventing the return of the Yellow Fever.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN order to comply with your request to the Academy of Medicine, communicated by Dr. Samuel Duffield, con∣sulting Physician of the port, respecting the means of prevent∣ing the return of the epidemic fever, which has lately afflict∣ed our city, the Academy have conceived the history of its origin, necessarily connected with their answer.</P>
<P>We believe it was derived from the following sources:</P>
<P N="1">1. The exhalations of the alleys, gutters, docks, and com∣mon sewers of the city; and from stagnating water in its neighbourhood.</P>
<P N="2">2. The foul air discharged with the ballast of the ship De∣borah, and the cargo of the brig Mary; the former of which arrived from Hispaniola on the 18th July, and the latter on the 29th of the same month. We reject the opinion of an imported human contagion in either of the above vessels. It has not been asserted that any person died of the yellow fe∣ver on board the Mary, during her voyage: and if it be said,
<PB N="xx" REF="035335_0127_1002332059279728"/>
that several persons died on board the Deborah of that disease, on her passage to this city, we cannot admit that they contami∣nated the timbers or contents of the ship in such a manner, as to spread the disease to persons at several hundred feet dis∣tance from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he wharf at which she was moored. The impro∣bability of this opinion will appear from two considerations.</P>
<P>First—The disease is not contagious in the West-Indies; and rarely, if ever so, in the United States in hot weather, at which time only it makes its first appearance in our country. So general is this opinion, that some physicians have unfor∣tunately refused to admit the existence of the fever in its com∣mencement in our city, only because it was not contagious.</P>
<P>Second—The disease was in no instance propagated by those persons who were supposed to have derived it from hu∣man contagion adhering to the timbers o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> contents of the Deborah and Mary, and who died with it in parts of the city remote from the influence of the foul air of those vessels.</P>
<P>If it be said that the contagion of the yellow fever is not uniform in its effects, it ought at least to be admitted, that it acts with most certainty where it exists with most force; but the reverse of this took place in the supposed origin of our late fever from imported contagion. We are the more deter∣mined in our opinion of the foul air of the Deborah and Mary being the cause of many cases of our fever, from simi∣lar cases of fever having been often produced from similar causes, instances of which were mentioned in our letter to you of last year.</P>
<P>In support of our opinion of the disease being derived from the exhalations of our city before enumerated, we shall men∣tion the names of the following persons, who had the fever before the arrival of the Deborah or Mary, in our port, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Benjamin Jones, Fromberger's Court, June 2d; Mary Wrig∣glesworth, near the corner of Walnut and Tenth-streets, June 6th; Rebecca Trested, in Front between Spruce and Union-streets, June 11th; Elizabeth Curran, Fourth below South-street, June 27th; Mark Miller, Callowhill-street, and Molly Zeller, Race-street, July 2d; Miss Byrne, Spruce between Second and Third streets, July 11th; Mr. Vannost, Shannon-street wharves, July 12th. We observed, moreover, and heard of a considerable number of persons who had the disease in the western parts of the city, and in Southwark and the Northern Liberties, who had not been exposed to con∣tagion, nor breathed the air in the neighbourhood of Water-street
<PB N="xxi" REF="035335_0128_10023323C99C7AD0"/>
for many weeks, and in some instances for several months, before they were attacked by that fever.</P>
<P>In addition to the arguments in favour of the domestic sources of the fever, that had been mentioned in our former letter, we shall add four more, that we think cannot be re∣futed.</P>
<P N="1">1. The atmosphere of our city, during the prevalence of the fever, produced sensations of pain or sickness in many people who came into it from the country; the same atmos∣phere became the cause of the disease and death in others who visited the city, and who carefully avoided lodging, or any intercourse with persons infected by the fever.</P>
<P N="2">2. The disease prevailed in many inland towns of the Unit∣ed States, which had no intercourse with those sea-port towns in which it was epidemic. Those towns were, in every in∣stance we have heard of, situated near to putrid substances, or stagnating water.</P>
<P N="3">3. The disease was rarely contagious, even when it termi∣nated in death, when carried into the country, or into towns not exposed to putrid exhalations.</P>
<P N="4">4. The general extinction of the disease by frost, clearly proves that it exists chiefly in the atmosphere; and that it is not derived, in the first instance, from human contagion; for frost, it is well known, does not act in the autumnal months upon the bodies of the sick, nor upon their beds, clothing, or any other supposed receptacle of contagion.</P>
<P>We wish to direct the attention of our fellow-citizens to the history of the causes and remedies of pestilential diseases in foreign countries: In the ages of medical superstition, when those diseases were believed to be imported, they nearly de∣populated cities for many successive years. Frequent and ac∣cumulated suffering at last begat wisdom. The causes of pestilence were discovered to exist in all countries, and do∣mestic remedies were applied to remove them. The effect of this change in the opinion and conduct of the nations of Europe has been the almost general extirpation of malignant fevers from their cities and sea ports. We have many docu∣ments to prove that the recurrence of the yellow fever has been prevented in the cities of Europe by cleanliness. It for∣merly prevailed in Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Holland, and, occasionally, in Britain and Ireland, under the names of putrid, malignant, and bilious fevers, also of the <HI>gall sickness</HI> and of the <HI>black fever.</HI> The last name was derived from the
<PB N="xxii" REF="035335_0129_1002332B8C6E0D78"/>
black vomiting, which is so often the symptom of approach∣ing death in bilious fevers.</P>
<P>We are the more confirmed in the opinion we have deliver∣ed, that the yellow fever is a native disease of our country, by discovering that the same opinion is held by most of the physicians and citizens of our sister states. We lament the prevalence of an opinion, that the admission of truth upon this subject, will injure the credit of our city. Truth, upon all subjects is ultimately friendly to general interest and hap∣piness, while the remedies of the evils of error, are always of a partial and transitory nature. We conceive that the report of the existence of a disease of a nature so subtle as to elude the utmost force of the health laws, and the greatest vigilance of health-officers, will be much more injurious to our city, than a belief of its being derived from causes which are ob∣vious to our senses, and which, by active exertions, might be easily and certainly removed, without oppressing or injuring our commerce.</P>
<P>We shall repeat, in this place, the means recommended by us in our former letter, with the addition of some others, for preventing a return of the disease.</P>
<P N="1">1. "Removing all those matters from our streets, gutters, cellars, gardens, yards, stores, vaults, ponds, &amp;c. which, by putrefaction in warm weather, afford the most frequent cause of the disease in this country. For this purpose, we recommend the appointment of a certain number of physi∣cians, whose business it shall be, to inspect all such places in the city, the Northern Liberties and Southwark, as contain any matters, capable by putrefaction, of producing the disease, and to have them removed.</P>
<P N="2">2. "We earnestly recommend the frequent washing of all impure parts of the city in warm and dry weather, by means of the pumps, until the water of the river Schuylkill can be made to wash all the streets of the city; a measure which we conceive promises to our citizens, the most durable exemp∣tion from bilious fevers of all kinds, of domestic origin.</P>
<P N="3">3. "To guard against the frequent source of yellow fever from the noxious air in the holds of vessels, we recommend the unlading such vessels, as contain cargoes liable to putre∣faction, and the discharging the ballast of all vessels at a dis∣tance from the city, during the months of June, July, Au∣gust, September and October. To prevent the generation of noxious air in the holds of vessels, we conceive every ves∣sel should be obliged, by law, to carry and use a ventilator, and
<PB N="xxiii" REF="035335_0130_10023332499DDA60"/>
we recommend in a particular manner, the one lately invent∣ed by Mr. Benjamin Wynkoop. We believe this invention to be one of the most important and useful that has been made in modern times, and that it is calculated to prevent not only the decay of ships and cargoes, but a very frequent source of pestilential diseases of all kinds in commercial ci∣ties."</P>
<P N="4">4. The filling up, or cleaning the docks in such a manner, that no matters, capable of putrefaction, shall be exposed to the rays of the sun at low water.</P>
<P N="5">5. The closing the common sewers, so as to admit water only, and the daily removal of the filth of the city, destined to flow into them, by means of covered carts or waggons made for that purpose.</P>
<P N="6">6. The prevention of the filth of the city from being accu∣mulated, and stagnating in its neighbourhood.</P>
<P N="7">7. The prohibition of alleys and narrow streets in the fu∣ture improvement of the city.</P>
<P N="8">8. An alteration of the present health law, which, by de∣taining vessels with perishable cargoes for ten days at the hos∣pital, in hot weather, is calculated to increase the foul air in their holds; and we recommend also, that no vessel, owned by a citizen of Philadelphia, be permitted to leave or enter our ports, that is not provided with a ventilator.</P>
<P>We shall conclude our letter by deprecating, in the most solemn manner, the continuance of a belief in the supposed importation of our fever, an opinion which has led to the to∣tal negligence of the means of preventing its return; also by humbly hoping that a merciful Providence may not correct our ignorance and prejudices, by frequent returns of a cala∣mity, which has in five years swept away ten thousand of our inhabitants, and which in a few years may, if not obviated by the only proper remedies, (under the influence of the present inflammatory constitution of the atmosphere) annihilate our city.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER from the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsyl∣vania, by direction of the Governor, relative to the late Ma∣lignant Fever, to the Board of Health.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Governor is desirous of submitting to the legislature, a comprehensive view of the mortality and expenditure, pro∣duced by the calamity, which has recently afflicted the city and its suburbs. He, therefore, directs me to request, that you will favour him with a report, and the necessary docu∣ments, upon the subject. The information contemplated may be properly embraced, perhaps, by the following enquiries.</P>
<P>1st. At what time, in what place, and in what manner, was the malignant fever introduced into the city and suburbs?</P>
<P>2d. How long did the fever continue to rage, and what is the number of its victims?</P>
<P>3d. What was the general police pursued by the Board, the overseers of the poor, and their agents, to subdue, or mitigate the disease, to aid the sick, to inter the dead, and to maintain the poor?</P>
<P>4th. What sum has been raised on this occasion, by taxes, by voluntary loan, and by gratuitous contributions; what sum has been expended, and what balance remains on hand?</P>
<P>5th. What is the number and condition of the citizens who have been relieved, and will any extraordinary aid be neces∣sary, on the part of the legislature, for the support of the poor during the ensuing winter?</P>
<P>6th. What precautions ought to be taken to prevent the recurrence of so dreadful a calamity?</P>
<P>Permit me to add, that it is the governor's wish, that the overseers of the poor, and, particularly those active citizens, who superintended the business of the camps, should be con∣sulted in forming your report. As the legislature meets on the 4th of December, I hope it will be convenient for you to comply with the governor's request, in the course of the pre∣sent month.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I have the honour to be, with sentiments of sincere respect and esteem, gentlemen, your most obedient humble servant, A. J. DALLAS, Secretary.</SIGNED> <DATELINE><HI>Secretary's Office, Philadelphia,</HI> <DATE><HI>8th November,</HI> 1798.</DATE></DATELINE></CLOSER>

<HEAD>REPLY to the foregoing Letter.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Health-Office,</HI> <DATE>1<HI>st December,</HI> 1798.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE secretary of the commonwealth, in a communica∣tion of the 8th <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lt. by your direction, having propounded certain queries relative to the late dreadful calamity, a sense of duty, common interest, and a poignant retrospect of the past scenes of misery and wretchedness, which came more im∣mediately under our care, have excited an intense solicitude and assiduity, on our part, to answer satisfactorily your en∣quiries, and devise means for the prevention of so terrible a scourge in future.</P>
<P>We regret that the continuance of the disease to so late a period has delayed the adjustment of the accounts of the in∣stitutions under our direction, and will consequently deprive us of that accuracy which is desirable. We believe, however, that the report will not ultimately be found materially in∣correct.</P>
<P>A few preliminary remarks, relative to the precautions which have been taken in order to prevent the importation of disease, may not be superfluous.</P>
<P>The law, in respect to quarantine, has been construed and executed in the strictest sense. Every power and effort which the board, or the officers under their direction, were capable of exercising, has been employed to cut off all communica∣tion with the vessels under quarantine.—Every possible mode of purification, which a law so manifestly defective would permit, has been adopted, and the most rigid scrutiny had, before the vessels were permitted to proceed to the city.</P>
<P>At the Marine Hospital, the fences were extended into the river, the more completely to enclose the premises, and all in∣tercourse therewith precluded.</P>
<P>For the sake of perspicuity we shall conform, as near as possible, to the order in which you have presented the several subjects of enquiry; and</P>
<P>1st. The malignant fever, according to our information, first made its appearance in Water-street, between Spruce and Walnut-streets, about the first of August. Several re∣spectable physicians declare that it appeared in the month of June; and, that many unequivocal cases occurred early in July.</P>
<P><PB N="xxvi" REF="035335_0133_1002333D35578480"/>
Unshackled by prejudice, and diffident of opinion, we have endeavoured to trace the disease to its origin, but without success. Those objects which have been pointed to with the greatest confidence as the foreign source of the disease, on in∣vestigation, afford no such proof.</P>
<P>Thus situated, it would be indecorous, in an official report to the chief magistrate, to substitute opinion for fact. We deem a question, on which the lives of thousands and the prosperity or annihilation of our flourishing city may depend, of too much importance to rest upon the <HI>exclusive speculation</HI> of either foreign or domestic origin.</P>
<P>In our answer to your 6th query, we shall endeavour to designate such general measures as, when properly digested by legislative wisdom, are, in our judgement, best calculated to guard against the recurrence of so fatal a malady from either domestic or foreign sources.</P>
<P>2d. The disease continued to rage until about the first of November; and, partially, until about the 5th. The whole number of victims, exclusive of those who died in the coun∣try, are three thousand six hundred and forty five.</P>
<P>3d. The City Hospital was opened on the 7th August—all vessels were immediately removed by order of the Board from all the wharves included between Mr. Levi Hollingsworth's and Tun Alley.—The Board publicly admonished the inha∣bitants of the infected neighbourhood to remove without delay.—A quantity of damaged coffee and cocoa, imported on the 30th July, and stored in Ross's stores, was reported on the 3d August to the Board to be in a putrid state. It was immediately put on board the vessel in which it was impor∣ted, and sent down to the Marine Hospital for purification.</P>
<P>Two skilful physicians and two assistants were appointed to reside at the City Hospital, with a competent number of nurses and attendants, and every thing necessary for the com∣fort and relief of the patients was provided. All the powers of reasoning, persuasion, and authority, which the Board pos∣sessed, short of absolute coercion, were assiduously employed to induce the sick to remove instantly to the Hospital; for which purpose carriages constantly attended, and litters were constructed as speedily as possibly, to convey them with ease and convenience.</P>
<P>All the regular practising physicians of the city and li∣berties were authorized to grant orders for admission into the City Hospital.—Hearses and persons were employed for the speedy removal and interment of the dead, and the Health-Office
<PB N="xxvii" REF="035335_0134_100233402362DA68"/>
kept open day and night, for the purpose of receiving applications and executing the duties of the office with promptitude.</P>
<P>In order to ascertain the progress of the disease and form some criterion by which to judge of its extension or decline, as well as to mark those parts of the city and liberties in which it raged with the greatest violence, a suitable person was appointed to obtain from the physicians the daily reports of new cases which occurred in their practice severally, toge∣ther with the names and residence of the patients.</P>
<P>Skilful physicians were appointed to attend the poor of the city and liberties, and medicines provided for their use at the expence of the institution.</P>
<P>The buildings at the City Hospital being found insufficient, a house contiguous thereto was rented; the summer houses were covered with canvas, a number of sheds, and a new frame building 60 by 20 feet, two stories high, were erected for the better accommodation of the sick.</P>
<P>The alarming progress of the disease, and frightful increase of mortality; the apparent temerity or apathy of some, and the indigence and distress of others, impelled the Board to reiterate in terms the most impressive, their admonitions to the inhabitants who were in circumstances to abandon their homes; and, in conjuction with the Guardians of the poor, to provide a retreat for the indigent.</P>
<P>Tents were accordingly erected on the east bank of Schuyl∣kill, to which they were invited to resort, and ample provi∣sion was there made for their comfort and support. These measures being inadequate to the urgency of the occasion, temporary buildings for the accommodation of near two thousand persons were erected on Masters' ground, two miles above the city.</P>
<P>The regulation and superintendance of each encampment was confided to a committee of respectable and humane citi∣zens, who voluntarily undertook the arduous task.</P>
<P>By the joint authority of the Board of Managers and the Board of Guardians of the poor, a committee of respectable citizens were appointed for the distribution of relief to the poor of the city and liberties, whose situation rendered it im∣proper to remove to the tents.</P>
<P>The infected houses and bedding were cleansed and puri∣fied, by order of the Board, so far as was found practicable. This, however, was but partial, owing to the inevitable diffi∣culties and confusion occasioned by the calamity.</P>

<P>Exclusive of the above expenditures and numbers of persons relieved, the guardians of the poor have incurred a very great and extraordinary expence for the relief of orphans and per∣sons distressed by the calamity.</P>
<P>5th. The poor will, doubtless, require extraodinary aid from the legislature the ensuing winter, in consequence of the suspension of labour during the prevalence of the disease, the extraordinary expenses incurred by sickness, or removal from the city, and, in all probability, a short interval from the re∣turn of the citizens to the closing of the navigation for the ex∣ercise of industry.</P>
<P>6th. No question can be more interesting, none more en∣titled to serious consideration, than that which shall deter∣mine the precautions to be adopted, in order to prevent the recurrence of a calamity so destructive. Accordingly, we find our fellow citizens generally engaged in the contempla∣tion and discussion of the subject.</P>
<P>Whatever difference of opinion may exist as to its origin, all appear to agree in the general system of police necessary to guard against its introduction in future.</P>
<P>The idea of resorting to the legislature of the union, for an act to interdict the commerce from the Mediterranean and West-Indies, during the summer months, appears to be general, and if attainable, would certainly be most desirable, at least until some effectual system shall be divised and com∣pletely ready for execution.</P>
<P>The great diversity of sentiment which appears to prevail in the different states, relative to the origin of the disease, toge∣ther with the powerful influence of commercial interest and rivalship, may create insurmountable obstacles to the attain∣ment of an efficient law from the general government.</P>
<P><PB N="xxxi" REF="035335_0138_10023352727DF2F8"/>
Under these circumstances, we think it will be prudent to persevere with energy in an application to the state legislature, for effectual quarantine and health laws, with liberal endow∣ments for the support of the several institutions. It may here be proper to observe that a well digested quarantine law of this state will be necessary (even in the event of a law of the general government) to provide for the ease of vessels which may enter our port from stress of weather, or other casualty during the period of interdiction.</P>
<P>We take the liberty of suggesting the propriety of an ap∣plication to the governments of the states of Delaware and New-Jersey for their co-operation. The principles of com∣mon interest and self-preservation, and their participation in the late calamity, must dictate to them the necessity of such a coalition.</P>
<P>A quarantine law to be effectual should make provision for the following objects.</P>
<P>An insular situation, remote from the city, should be se∣lected, if practicable, for the place of quarantine; if none such can be obtained, forty or fifty acres on some convenient part of the Delaware shore should be secured by a high and strong enclosure—wharves, ware houses, and other suitable buildings should be erected for the reception and purification of cargoes and accommodation of persons.</P>
<P>All vessels from the Mediterranean and West-Indies, from the first of June to the first October, should there discharge their cargoes, which, together with the vessels, should be thoroughly purified, and perform a quarantine of at least 20 days. Guards should be constantly posted at all the avenues, and guard boats stationed around the fleet.</P>
<P>The law should provide for the prohibition of intercourse by land or water with such of our sister states as may not a∣dopt efficient quarantine laws; and interdict all communi∣cation with infected places.</P>
<P>Having designated those general regulations, which we conceive are best adapted to guard against the importation of disease, we shall take the liberty of adverting to measures, which appear to us no less necessary to the health and pros∣perity of our city.</P>
<P>If the domestic origin of the disease is denied, yet it must be allowed that local causes have a potent effect in its diffusion, and encreasing its malignity; of this, fatal experience has furnished an irrefragable proof in the excessive mortality, and number of the diseased, in particular parts of the city and li∣berties.</P>
<P><PB N="xxxii" REF="035335_0139_1002335653468260"/>
We believe that these dreadful consequences would be greatly mitigated, if not wholly averted, by a judicious refor∣mation in the police of the city and liberties.</P>
<P>The introduction of wholesome running water for domestic purposes, and for washing the streets, and common sewers, is in our judgment, an object of primary importance; the cleansing of all the docks to a depth below the level of low water mark, a strict attention to the removal of all filth and putrifying substances, and correcting the noxious effluvia from the privies in the commencement of the hot season, would, we conceive, be productive of the happiest effects.</P>
<P>The great attention which has been paid to the cleansing of the best improved parts of our city, and the obvious ne∣glect of remote and confined situations, has long been a sub∣ject of serious complaint.</P>
<P>Any work, however great, will be but partial whilst the stagnant pools, and filth of the narrow lanes, alleys and yards, in the extremities of the city, and particularly in the districts of Southwark and the Nothern Liberties, are suffered to exist.</P>
<P>We beg leave to call your attention to a subject which we consider as deeply interesting.</P>
<P>The establishment of a City Hospital upon an enlarged plan, permanently provided with every thing necessary for the comfort and relief of the sick, and skilful professors, nurses, &amp;c. provisionally engaged in the event of a recur∣rence of the disease, would excite public confidence, and greatly diminish the evils of the calamity. The situation of the present City Hispital, we consider as highly improper for the purpose, from its contiguity to the marshes of the Schuylkill. The lots and improvements thereon, if sold, would, probably produce a sum equivalent to the purchase of an elevated situation, and the completion of buildings bet∣ter adapted to the purpose.</P>
<P>We have been led into unavoidable prolixity from the mag∣nitude of the subject, and a wish to contribute the result of our experience and observations. Should they produce, in any degree, the desired effect, it will alleviate the recollection of those painful scenes which it was our lot to witness, and our duty to relieve.</P>
