<HEAD>RULERS Should be Benefactors.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>LUKE XXII. 25.</BIBL>
<Q>And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and they that exercise authority upon them, are called Benefactors.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE high and solemn Occasion of the <HI>Day</HI> will not allow me to take up the time in looking back into the preceeding <HI>Context;</HI> I shall therefore only just hint at the <HI>Occasion</HI> of the words I have now read unto you, and then consider <HI>the words</HI> themselves.</P>
<P>As to the occasion of them, it was an unhappy <HI>Contention</HI> among the Disciples of CHRIST about <HI>Primary</HI> and Superiority, in the Verse which imme∣diately
<PB N="2" REF="002340_0005_0FDB2C288D33D260"/>
preceeds the Text, <HI>there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.</HI> Contention is the fruit of pride and ambition. Men that have a mind to be uppermost in the World can't be quiet, unless they are gra∣tified in it. But all the Disciples of CHRIST were not guilty of this unseasonable affectation; the two Sons of <HI>Zebedee</HI> it seems were the chief in this business. Its well the other of CHRIST's Dis∣ciples had more wisdom, and more grace, than to make so much trouble about secular honor and pro∣motion.</P>
<P>IT becomes the Disciples of CHRIST to be <HI>humble,</HI> and to watch against ambition. The meek and the admirable <HI>JESUS</HI> to quiet the Spirits of these aspiring Disciples tells them, that Tem∣poral Lordship and Dominion did not belong to them, that he had superior honors to bestow upon them, after they had served him a while here in the world, and that if they would have a little patience, he would promote them unto great honor, and make them <HI>Sit upon thrones judging the tribes of Israel.</HI></P>
<P>THEIR business at present was not to be mini∣stred unto, but to minister; and it was a vanity in them to dream of Temporal Promotion, for <HI>his kingdom was not of this world▪</HI> The high and dig∣nified Titles of <HI>Archontes</HI> and <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> did not belong to them, but only those of <HI>Doul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i,</HI> and <HI>Dia∣cona<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> Temporal Power and Jurisdiction belongs to the Princes of the Gentiles, and not unto the Ministers of CHRIST. <HI>The Kings of the Gentiles exercise Lordship over them, and they that exercise</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="002340_0006_0FDB2C2BCCF50828"/>
<HI>authority upon them are called Benefactors.</HI> And so we are come to the Words themselves; and in them we may observe.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE Power that <HI>Sovereign Princes</HI> are In∣vested with, it is a Power of <HI>Lordship</HI> and Domi∣nion. <HI>The Kings of the Gentiles exercise Lordship.</HI> They do it <HI>defacto,</HI> and they do it <HI>de jure.</HI> The supream Dominion is the LORD's; but there is a delegated Dominion and Power vested in the Sons of Men. GOD is the Sovereign LORD; but the Princes and Kings of the Earth are his Lieutenants, his Deputies and Vicegerents, and have a lawfull right to exercise Dominion.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE <HI>Ends</HI> to which they ought to exercise their Authority; to the good, the benefit, the ad∣vantage of those who are under their Authority. This is the great End of all Rule and Government; and the best Ends of Government are prevented, when they that have the Dominion tyrannize over the People, and exercise their Authority in a Lordly and Domineering manner; this Power is given <HI>for Edification and not for Destruction.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. THE honorable <HI>Appellation</HI> that belongs to them when they exercise their Authority regularly, and suitably to the original design and institution of Government: <HI>They are called Benefactors</HI>▪ And very properly called so, according to the notation of the Word; because <HI>they do good</HI> in their places, make a proper Improvement of their Powers, and are <HI>Publick Blessings</HI> to the World.</P>
<P>THE Greek Word <HI>Kalountai,</HI> is often used for <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i,</HI> they <HI>are</HI> Benefactors, and shall be <HI>called,</HI> ac∣counted, esteemed, and highly honored as such to
<PB N="4" REF="002340_0007_0FDB2C2D4B824A00"/>
the Kingdoms and Countries under their auspicious Government.</P>
<P>THE Kings of the Gentiles▪ were fond of assu∣ming magnificent <HI>Titles</HI> unto themselves, and sometimes the good they did to the Publick, justly merited some memorable Appellation. So one of the <HI>AEgyptian Ptolomies</HI> had the name of <HI>Euer∣get<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es,</HI> and if <HI>Tertull<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> the Orator might be be∣lieved, <HI>Felix</HI> the Roman Governour for the Pro∣vince of <HI>Judea</HI> was a happy Ruler, and might well be called a Benefactor; for this is the Encomium given of him. Acts 24. 2. <HI>Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,</HI> &amp;c. This was an Excellent commendation of <HI>Felix,</HI> his Go∣vernment, if it had been <HI>true</HI> and spoken without flattery. But <HI>Tacitus</HI> says of <HI>Felix</HI> that he was <HI>Inexplebilis Gurges</HI> an Insatiable Gulph of Cove∣tousness. The <HI>Jewish Historian</HI> speaks of his Incon∣tinency, and the <HI>Sacred Story</HI> gives us reason end to think that he was Intemperate and Unjust; or else he would not have trembled as he did, when the <HI>Apostle reasoned before him of righteousness, and of temperance, and of the Judgment to come,</HI> And a Man of so much Corruption, could never make a good Governour. The Pretended Successors of <HI>Peter</HI> have also assumed the venerable names of <HI>Pius,</HI> &amp; <HI>Clement,</HI> &amp; <HI>Innocent,</HI> &amp; <HI>Boniface;</HI> as if they excell'd other Men in Piety, Clemency, Innocency and good works; but the World knows how poorly they have answered these honorary Titles.</P>
<P>BUT this is the honorable <HI>Appellation</HI> which belongs unto the <HI>Princes</HI> of the Earth when the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="5" REF="002340_0008_0FDB2C2FF6B186A0"/>
Exercise their Authority unto the best good of the People: <HI>They are Benefactors:</HI> 'Tis their <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty</HI> to be such, and when they are such it is their <HI>Glory</HI> and their Excellency. Accordingly the Doctrine may be,</P>
<P><LABEL>DOCTRINE.</LABEL>
<HI>THAT it is the Duty and Excellency of those that are in Authority to be Benefactors.</HI> So to <HI>Im∣prove</HI> the Power &amp; Authority given them from Above, that they may deserve to be so <HI>called.</HI></P>
<P>THERE are two <HI>Propositions</HI> I would speak to under this Doctrine.</P>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>THAT the Divine Providence does call some to Exercise Authority over Others.</HI> And here we may consider,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THAT the Supream Dominion is the LORDS. Dominion and fear are with Him. His is the Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory for ever, Amen.</HI></P>
<P>HIS Authority is the most Sovereign, Abso∣lute and Supream. He is <HI>Higher than the Kings of the Earth;</HI> He hath <HI>a Name above every Name.</HI> All humane Power is <HI>Derivative,</HI> but His is an <HI>Original,</HI> Absolute, Eternal, &amp; Independent Power; He is the <HI>Blessed and Only Potentate;</HI> He is the <HI>King Eternal,</HI> Immortal, Invisible, the only Wise GOD, to whom belongs the Dominion, and the Power for ever.</P>
<P>AND His Dominion is the most <HI>Extensive.</HI> As He is the <HI>Everlasting GOD the LORD, the
<PB N="6" REF="002340_0009_0FDB2C3463585AE8"/>
Creator of all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Earth;</HI> So He is the <HI>Governour▪ among the nations,</HI> and all Creatures <HI>in all places of his dominion</HI> are under His Rule &amp; Gubernation.</P>
<P>THE Princes of the Earth had their <HI>Proprietary</HI> Governments <HI>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead of Syria is Damascus, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead of Damascus is Rezin,</HI> i. e. <HI>Damascus</HI> is the Capital City of <HI>Syria,</HI> and <HI>Rezin</HI> is King thereof. <HI>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead of Ephraim is Samaria; and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead of Samaria is Remah<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'s son,</HI> Isa. 7. 8. But GOD is the Head and King over all the Countries and Kingdoms of the World; their Powers are li∣mited &amp; confined unto their own narrow Districts and Territories; but GOD is a universal King; <HI>He ruleth by his power for ever, his eyes behold the nations,</HI> Psal. 66. 7. He hath established his throne in the Heaven, <HI>and his kingdom ruleth over all;</HI> There the <HI>Antient of days</HI> does sit, and is waited upon with State and Magnificence, the glorious Angels are His royal Attendance, and there is an Innumerable Company of them. <HI>The Chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of Angels, God is in the midst of them, as in Sinai, in his holy place.</HI></P>
<P>AND as the Supream and Sovereign LORD, He gives <HI>Laws</HI> unto the whole Creation; He orders all the times and the changes that go over the Kingdoms, and the Countries; and in all His Ad∣ministrations He is <HI>excellent in Power, and in Judgment, and in Plenty of Justice;</HI> and thô His Judgments are a great deep, and we cannot know them by reason of darkness; yet we should always reverence and adore the rectitude of His governing
<PB N="7" REF="002340_0010_0FDB2C36CF73A488"/>
Providence, and be ready to pay that just acknow∣ledgement unto GOD, Psal. 97. 2. <HI>Though clouds and darkness are round about him, yet Righteous∣ness and Judgment are the habitation of his throne.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THE Divine Providence calls some from among men, to exercise Authority over others.</HI> The Wisdom of GOD has Established a Government in the World, and ordained that there should be a rule over Men; and the World without it would no more be a <HI>Cosmos</HI> but a <HI>Chaos.</HI> When <HI>Lycurgus</HI> was Importuned by one to establish a popular Parity in the State, Do thou says he, first begin it in thy own Family. Civil Government is of Divine In∣stitution; and the Institution is so necessary that human Societies cannot subsist without it. There is a Rule even in the Kingdom of Darkness, and a Prince of the Power of the Air. The light of Na∣ture led the Nations to practise upon this Princi∣ple: the Gentiles had their Kings. But the Divine Providence over-rules; and GOD that Governs the World puts the Scepter into their hands. Hence the Prophet <HI>Daniel</HI> tells <HI>Belshezzar,</HI> Dan. 5. 18. <HI>The most high God gave unto Nebuchadnezzar thy Father a Kingdom, and Majesty, &amp; Honour, &amp; Glory.</HI> Hence 'tis said, <HI>Prov.</HI> 8. 15. <HI>By me Kings reign. For me</HI> Kings reign, so some read it; and if we should read it so, it may teach the Kings of the Earth, that they ought to rule for GOD, and im∣prove their Authority to His Glory. Some read it, <HI>In me,</HI> that is, in the Exalting &amp; Honouring of me they shall reign prosperously: If they honour me, I will honour them, if they exalt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, I will
<PB N="8" REF="002340_0011_0FDB2C37D95F9718"/>
Establish them. The best way for Kings, and their Kingdoms to flourish is to serve the LORD.</P>
<P>BUT we read it, <HI>By me,</HI> that is, not meerly by Divine Permission, but by Divine <HI>Ordination,</HI> and Appointment: Whether Kingdoms be Hereditary, or Elective, yet the <HI>Powers that be, are ordained of GOD.</HI> The Eternal King has an uncontroulable right to give the Kingdoms of Men unto whomso∣ever He will; and sometimes He sets over them the basest of Men, to the intent that Men may know, that the Most High does rule, that Dominion is not founded in Grace, and that the Gifts of Providence are dispensed by a Sovereign hand. So sometimes GOD <HI>lifteth up the poor out of the dust, and raiseth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to cause them to inherit the throne of glory; for the pillars of the Earth are the Lords, and he hath set the world upon them,</HI> 1 Sam. 2. 8.</P>
<P>THIS may suffice for the first <HI>Proposition.</HI></P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>THEY that exercise Authority over others should be Benefactors.</HI> They should exercise their Authority to the benefit of the People, that they may be worthy of that honorable Appella∣tion.</P>
<P>AND here I shall endeavour first to shew <HI>wherein</HI> they should be Benefactors, and then shall consider their <HI>Obligation</HI> to be such.</P>
<P N="1">1. I shall endeavour first to show <HI>wherein</HI> they should be Benefactors, and I will only mention <HI>four</HI> particulars.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="9" REF="002340_0012_0FDB2C39680BBD50"/>
(1.) <HI>BY making the best Laws for the benefit of the People.</HI> Good Laws are a benefit to a People. And <HI>wise Lawgivers are great Benefactors,</HI> and have been honored as such among the Nations. So was <HI>Solon, Lycurgus,</HI> and others. The making of Laws is one branch of the <HI>Power</HI> committed unto Rulers; and the making of good Laws will be one princi∣pal Instance of their <HI>Wisdom,</HI> their <HI>Integrity,</HI> and their <HI>Publick Care</HI> for their People.</P>
<P><HI>LAWS</HI> for the defending them in their Com∣mon Rights as Men, and Religious Rights as Chri∣stians: Laws for the direction of the Ministers of Justice; that they may know how to minister Jus∣tice and Judgment unto all Israel: Laws for the detecting and punishing Fraud, Forgery, Perjury, and every bold Iniquity: The most effectual Laws possible, for the suppressing Prophaness, Intempe∣rance &amp; every Immorality; and <HI>Sumptuary</HI> Laws as their Wisdom shall think fit for the governing the Expences of a People, the Retrenching the overgrown and insupportable Excesses and Extra∣vagancies; and Encouraging Thriftiness and Fru∣gality. The <HI>Romans</HI> made Laws to moderate the Excesses of Diet and Apparel.</P>
<P>BUT then it should be minded, that 'tis <HI>Exe∣cution</HI> that gives life and force to Laws, and makes them quick and powerfull, and without this <HI>the sons of Zeruia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> will put forth their heads. The Lusts of Men are very unruly things, and they that are under the dominion of them will run unto all Ex∣cess of Riot▪ These raging waves of the Sea will be foaming out their own shame, these Sons of Vio∣lence will not be restrained, unless the Civil Ma∣gistrate
<PB N="10" REF="002340_0013_0FDB2C3D6B4E45F0"/>
unsheath the Sword of Justice, and smite thrô the Loins of them that work Iniquity.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>BY Employing the best of Men in the Admini∣stration.</HI> I know every good Man is not qualified for Rule. There are Gifts for Government, that are distinct from the Gifts of Sanctification▪ yet the People will rejoyce when the Righteous are in Authority. If Rulers are strangers to GOD, to CHRIST, to Virtue, to Religion, and they that work wickedness are set up, and Men of the most Loyal and Religious Principles, thrô unreasonable prejudices laid aside, it can't be for the Honor of GOD, for the Interest of a People, nor for the glory of the Government. When <HI>Solomon</HI> saw <HI>folly set in great dignity,</HI> he says it was <HI>an Error:</HI> Eccl. 10. 5. The most distinguishing honors are certainly due to Men of Merit, to such as have distinguish'd themselves by their Virtue, their Loyalty, their Fidelity; by their noble and generous Service for the Publick; their good deeds should not be for∣gotten, their names ought to be in everlasting re∣membrance. The Laws of Honour, of Justice, and of Gratitude oblige hereunto. The <HI>Roman</HI> great∣ness was much owing to their Honor and Justice herein▪ And the <HI>Persian Monarchs</HI> kept a Register Book of the Names of the Benefactors, that Honor might be done them accordingly, <HI>Esth.</HI> 6. And he that deprives Men of the honor due to Virtue, de∣prives them of Virtue it self, says <HI>Cato.</HI> And on the other hand, when Persons have rendred them∣selves unworthy of the Publick Trust, by their meaness, their mercinariness, their baseness▪ by
<PB N="11" REF="002340_0014_0FDB2C3EC50412A8"/>
their loose principles, and their corrupt and cove∣tous practices; they should not have the Publick Countenance; they should have no Opportunity put into their hands to go off with the spoil of their oppressed Neighbours; they will <HI>transgress for a piece of bread.</HI> They should therefore <HI>break the Jaws of the wicked, and pluck the spoil out of their teeth.</HI></P>
<P N="3">(3.) <HI>BY setting the best Examples before the People.</HI> Good Examples may do a great deal of Good. The Examples of Rulers will be likely to have a great deal of Influence, when they are Men of Virtue, Probity and Goodness, and excell therein. Their bright and shining Examples will enlighten &amp; influence others. But when Rulers are the <HI>Rulers of Sodom,</HI> the People will be the <HI>People of Gomorrah. If a Ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked.</HI> They should not therefore indulge themselves in any thing that is mean, sor∣did, or dishonourable. Its pity that Men of Honor and Distinction in the World, should bring a stain upon all their Glory by a sordid Indulgence unto any base Lust, or tarnish the brightness of their Cha∣racter with some such Exception as that, or one a great deal worse than that, 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 5. 1.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) <HI>BY doing what they can to establish and pro∣mote the true Religion.</HI> Religion is the <HI>Life</HI> of a People, and by taking care of that we shall <HI>prolong our days in the land,</HI> which the LORD GOD gave unto our Fathers.</P>
<P>IT is the <HI>Strength</HI> of a People, and by taking care of that, Rulers will be the Strength, and the <HI>Stability of our times.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="002340_0015_0FDB2C40CE29E678"/>
IT is the <HI>Safety</HI> of a People, and by taking care of that, we shall be safe <HI>under the shadow of the Almighty.</HI> And in the Day when it shall revive and flourish, even in that Day shall this <HI>Song</HI> be sung in the Land, <HI>We have a strong City, Salvation will God appoint for walls and for bulwarks</HI></P>
<P>IT is the <HI>Glory</HI> of a People, and it will make us <HI>high in name, and in praise, and in honour above all people. Righteousness exalteth a nation, but sin is a reproach unto any people.</HI></P>
<P>RELIGION has both a <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>moral</HI> ten∣dency to promote the Prosperity of a People: if Religion flourishes the Country will flourish; and we shall prosper whithersoever we turn our selves. Our <HI>Merchandize</HI> will flourish, and that will be a benefit to the Country; our <HI>Fishery</HI> will flourish and that will be an advantage; our <HI>Husbandry</HI> will flourish, and that will be a benefit, <HI>for the King himself, is served by the field:</HI> then shall <HI>Zebulun rejoice in his goings forth, and Issachar in his tent.</HI></P>
<P>RELIGION tends to <HI>prevent and divert Divine Judgments;</HI> and the Judgments of GOD are wasting and breaking things; they make a Land mourn, they cause the <HI>glory of Jacob to wax thin, and the fulness of his flesh to wax lean.</HI></P>
<P>RELIGION tends to <HI>secure the Divine Presence</HI> and Blessing; and the Presence of GOD with a People, is the making of a People; if GOD leave them they can't be happy, if GOD be with them they can't be miserable. <HI>The Lord his God is with him▪ and the shout of a king is in the midst of them; he hath as it were the strength of a Unicorn,</HI> Numb. 23. 21. Where there is much of Religion or the
<PB N="13" REF="002340_0016_0FDB2C44DE19A0A0"/>
Power of godliness among a People, GOD will not leave them, nor forsake them. So that our Religion is the foundation of all our hopes &amp; expectations. This is the best foundation we can build our hopes upon, both as to the present and future Generation; as long as this shall continue in its glory, and in∣crease, we may humbly hope for the blessing of Heaven even upon our latest Posterity: for the Mercy of the LORD <HI>is from everlasting to everlast∣ing upon them that fear him,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>2. LET us consider the <HI>Obligations</HI> on Rulers to be <HI>Benefactors.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>THEY are Ordained of GOD for this very End.</HI> Rom. 13. 4. That they may be <HI>Mini∣sters of GOD for good;</HI> Instruments in the hands of Divine Providence to the weal &amp; prosperity of a People. This is the End of their betrustment, they should therefore lay out themselves for the good of the People; defend their rights &amp; liberties, and protect them in all their valuable Priviledges, and when they do so, they are the light &amp; life of a People. They are <HI>as the light of the Morning, when the Sun ariseth, even a Morning without clouds,</HI> 2 Sam. 23. 4. They are <HI>the breath of our Nostrils,</HI> the <HI>anointed of the Lord; of whom we said, We shall live under their shadow among the beathen.</HI></P>
<P>BUT when Rulers forget their duty, and abuse their Power; when they neglect their care, their People and their charge; grow Imperious and Ty∣rannical, lord it over GOD's Heritage, and are like <HI>the kine of Bashan in the mountains of Samaria, that oppress the poor &amp; crush the needy, and say to their master bring and let us drink;</HI> they are so far from
<PB N="14" REF="002340_0017_0FDB2C46E4DE4350"/>
answering the Ends of Government, and from be∣ing <HI>Benefactors,</HI> that they are the greatest <HI>Burdens</HI> unto Mankind, and the greatest <HI>Plagues</HI> and pun∣ishments to the World. <HI>As a roaring Lion and a ranging Bear, so is a wicked ruler among the Peo∣ple,</HI> Prov. 28. 15.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>THE Publick Support is another Obligati∣tion upon them. For this very cause do we pay tribute,</HI> sayes the Apostle, <HI>Because they are Gods Ministers attending continually upon this very thing,</HI> Rom. 13. 6. The <HI>bread of the Governour</HI> is given that they might Imploy their Time, their Talents, and Powers in the Service of the Publick. Reason and Conscience obliges the People to support them if they do attend upon it. And the <HI>Lord JESUS CHRIST</HI> has laid this duty upon the People to∣wards their Rulers, in the same Commandment with the duty they owe to GOD. Math. 22. 21. <HI>Render therefore unto Caesar the things that are Cae∣sars, and unto God the things that are Gods.</HI> And therefore as we should be ready to render <HI>tribute to whom tribute is due, custom to whom custom, fear to whom fear, and honour to whom honour</HI> is due; so they that receive it are verily <HI>debtors unto us,</HI> to do us all the good they can.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) <HI>THE special Trust &amp; Confidence reposed in them is a further Obligation upon them.</HI> The <HI>King</HI> as Supream is put in trust by GOD to be a <HI>Nursing Father</HI> to His People: and <HI>Governours,</HI> and such as are sent abroad by him, into the <HI>Kings Provinces,</HI> are Intrusted by their <HI>Royal Master,</HI> and He has a Confidence in them that they will Exercise their Authority to the best advantage of the <HI>Provinces.</HI>

But if they should seek not their welfare but their hurt, and <HI>damage arise to the King,</HI> or to His Sub∣jects; They basely betray their trust, are false to GOD, and disloyal to their Prince; are criminal and deeply guilty, and forfeit the good Character in the <HI>Text.</HI> Yea, they are under the <HI>Oath</HI> of GOD, and that adds weight &amp; solemnity to the trust; and they can't neglect their duty herein without the deepest Perjury and Guilt: The tye is Sacred and Deep to manage this great betrustment faithfully, and to them may be directed the words of the wise Man, <HI>I counsel thee to keep the Kings Command∣ment, because of the Oath of God.</HI></P>
<P N="4">(4.) <HI>THE Sacred Rules given by the Holy Ghost, to direct their Administrations, are a strong Obligation upon them.</HI> They have indeed the Statutes of the <HI>Kingdom</HI> for their direction: but yet they should make the Statutes of <HI>GOD</HI> the Man of their coun∣cel; they should have a <HI>Copy</HI> of these alwayes be∣fore them, <HI>and should read therein all the dayes of their lives;</HI> and they shall do well if they take heed unto them: They can't be good Rulers, if they have no regard to the Rules of Righteousness and of Justice; if they turn aside after Lucre and take Bribes, and corrupt Judgment, they forget what the Spirit of the LORD said unto <HI>David,</HI> 2 Sam. 23. 2. <HI>The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake unto me; he that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="5">(5.) <HI>THE honourable Titles</HI> given to Rulers, teaches them they should be <HI>Benefactors.</HI></P>

<P>THEY are the <HI>shields of the Earth,</HI> and should defend them from all that shoot their Arrows at them.</P>
<P>THEY are the <HI>Pillars of the Earth,</HI> and should support and strengthen the State, by their Wisdom and Counsel.</P>
<P>THEY are the <HI>strong foundation</HI> of the Earth, <HI>and if the foundation is overthrown, what can the righteous do?</HI></P>
<P>THEY are <HI>heirs of restraint,</HI> according to the Marginal Note in <HI>Judg.</HI> 18. 7. and should put a check to the growing Sins of the times, by punish∣ing Intemperance, Excesses and Iniquities of the places where they Rule.

USE, 1. <HI>SEE what should govern the Sons of Men in desiring or accepting places in the Govern∣ment.</HI> Not meerly to gratify an ambitious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mour, or that they might have the Dominion; nor that they may Domineer and Lord it over others, be∣cause <HI>they delight to crush under their feet the pri∣soners of the earth:</HI> But that they may serve GOD, &amp; his People, and be <HI>Publick Blessings</HI> to the World.</P>
<P>MEN that are desirous of Rule should examine their <HI>Principles,</HI> and see what it is that governs them in their Desires; and their <HI>Capacities</HI> too, to see whether they are equal to the Places they desire. "There are aspiring <HI>Absaloms</HI> that say, <HI>O that I were a Judge in Israel,</HI> and will caress the People, and use all the arts of Insinuation to make an Interest for themselves". But alas, they that are fondest of places are not always the fittest for them; and it amounts to a demonstration that it is so, when we see they don't know what to do with them when they have them.</P>
<P>WHEN such petition for Promotion, they may be modestly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> replied to in the Words of our <HI>Saviour</HI> unto these two aspiring Disciples, <HI>Ye know not what ye ask</HI></P>
<P>2. <HI>WHEN Rulers are Benefactors, they should be treated as such, and be Loved, Obeyed &amp;
 Honoured accordingly.</HI> A Just and Wise <HI>Government</HI> is a Di∣vine and Heavenly Blessing, and when the <HI>Eter∣nal Father</HI> commands this Blessing upon us, we should <HI>accept it always with all thankfulness.</HI> We have such an Interest and Concernment in the <HI>Princes</HI> that sit upon the Throne of Great <HI>Britain,</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="002340_0021_0FDB2C4F0BED15D8"/>
that when the Throne of those Kingdoms is filled with such a <HI>Royal Benefactor</HI> as it is this Day, we should <HI>bow our knee unto the Father of Spirits</HI> for such a Royal Blessing, and be ready too to bow the knee unto our <HI>most gracious King,</HI> and cry before him, as they did to <HI>Joseph</HI> in the Day of his ad∣vancement, <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rech,</HI> which signifies, <HI>tender Father.</HI> And they that are uneasy under such a Government and Rebellious to it, are certainly guilty of the greatest <HI>Ingratitude</HI> to GOD, and to their Prince: And yet under the best of Kings, there are such uneasy and <HI>male-contented</HI> Spirits, who are difficult to the publick Peace and Tranquillity. But <HI>the Sons of Belial shall all be as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands; but he that will touch them, must be fenced with Iron and the staff of a spear;</HI> as 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 23. 6.</P>
<P>AND when by his <HI>Royal favour</HI> we are blest with <HI>Rulers,</HI> who are disposed to be <HI>Benefactors</HI> to us, and are glad of opportunities to serve us, and pro∣mote our best Interest, we should show our selves a <HI>Loyal,</HI> and a <HI>Gratefull</HI> People, and testify the <HI>sense</HI> of the Divine Favor to us herein, by obey∣ing the <HI>Powers</HI> that are set over us; <HI>Let us fear God, and honor the King, and not meddle with them that are given to change.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>LET those who are called by the Providence of GOD, to exercise Authority over us, be Bene∣factors to us.</HI> Let our <HI>Spiritual Rulers</HI> be Bene∣factors. When our <HI>Saviour</HI> says to His Disciples in the next words to the Text, <HI>but ye shall not be so▪</HI> He does not mean that they should not be <HI>Bene∣factors,</HI> No; they should be eminently such. They
<PB N="19" REF="002340_0022_0FDB2C508FE394C8"/>
are Rulers in the House of their GOD; but they must not <HI>Lord it over God's heritage.</HI> They are not Lords of their Faith; they have no just claim to a Spiritual Jurisdiction over the Consciences of Men, to make <HI>Ecclesiastical Canons,</HI> and demand Obedience to them upon the pain of damnation. Their business is to Study, and Pray, and Preach, and use their utmost wisdom and skill to bring Men from under the power of Satan, that he may no longer exercise Dominion over them▪ to show them that the Government of CHRIST is the most easy and safe; <HI>that his yoke is easy, and his burden is light;</HI> and so to bring them to obey the <HI>Laws</HI> of CHRIST, and the <HI>Doctrines</HI> of the Gospel.</P>
<P>IF you can serve them in their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Inte∣rests, if you can do any thing that by the Blessing of GOD may <HI>prevent</HI> their misery in a day of common Calamity, you will do well; but you will be Benefactors indeed, when you study to do their <HI>Souls</HI> good, to convince them of the evil of <HI>Sin,</HI> and the danger of <HI>damnation,</HI> of the necessity of <HI>Re∣pentance</HI> towards GOD, and <HI>Faith</HI> in our LORD JESUS CHRIST; to bring them unto a sense of their Duty, and into the Love and practice of Vir∣tue: This is the greatest Service that you can do to poor Sinners; in doing this you will be the greatest Benefactors to them; you cannot do them a greater kindness: And know for your Encourage∣ment, that <HI>he that Converts a sinner from the Error of his way, shall save a soul from death.</HI></P>
<P>AND let <HI>Civil Rulers</HI> do us all the good they can also. I have hinted a few things wherein you may be Benefactors to us. I shall not stand to re∣peat
<PB N="20" REF="002340_0023_0FDB2C5243C37488"/>
them, only one thing I must beg leave to Inculcate, and to Insist upon, because all our hap∣piness is bound up in it; and that is RELIGION, and nothing is more worthy of your Care; nor can any thing make us happy without it.</P>
<P><HI>CAMILLUS</HI> did Appeal to the Experience of the <HI>Romans,</HI> whether ever they had better Luck than when they carefully served GOD, or worse than when they neglected Him. And <HI>Cyrus</HI> as <HI>Xeno∣phon</HI> observes, laid the foundation of the <HI>Persian Empire,</HI> not so much by his <HI>Valour,</HI> as by a <HI>Reli∣gious</HI> Worship of Heaven, and Liberality in the Service of GOD. And does not the <HI>Prophet</HI> of GOD ascibe the Prosperity of <HI>Israel,</HI> in the Days of the good King <HI>Josiah,</HI> to his Virtue and his Goodness, his Religion and his Righteousness, and sets his Ex∣ample as a Pattern for Government before the face of his Successor? <HI>Did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hy father eat and drink, and do Justice and Judgment, and then it was well with him?</HI> Jer. 22. 15.</P>
<P>AND has it not always been round, that the <HI>Decays</HI> of Religion among a People, has been a fatal <HI>Symptom</HI> upon them? And that there is no surer Sign of a Countries Destruction than Contempt of Religion? <HI>despising the Ep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d</HI> was, as one says, the rot of <HI>Sauls</HI> Kingdom; this was it that br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t <HI>Judah</HI> Low, and laid her even with the ground; 'Twas this that sapt the foundation of that once stately and flourishing Kingdom, and hastned upon them those Consumptive Judgments that devoured <HI>Jacob,</HI> and laid her pleasant Places desolate.</P>
<P>AND I am sure if the welfare of this People, of this Country, and of these Churches has such a
<PB N="21" REF="002340_0024_0FDB1204392618B0"/>
Dependance upon our Religion, its worth while to take care for the life and growth, the preservation and the prosperity of it; and if our Rulers would be Benefactors to us they must Espouse the cause thereof.</P>
<P>Two things I would say, if need be; to move you to it,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IT is the best Religion in the World.</HI> It is a Religion that came from Heaven, and it will carry every Man thither who is true to the principles of it. A Religion that came from GOD, and is pure∣ly of Divine Institution: A Religion that has not only GOD for its <HI>Author,</HI> but Holiness for its <HI>Rule,</HI> and Happiness for its <HI>Reward.</HI> A Religion that Instructs in the whole Duty of Man; and teaches us to <HI>fear GOD,</HI> and <HI>honour the King,</HI> as well as to <HI>love the Brotherhood:</HI> A Religion that recom∣mends <HI>Whatsoever things are true, honest, just pure, lovely, and of good report,</HI> Phil. 4. 8. A Reli∣gion that not only binds us to a strict <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> but to the highest degrees of <HI>Sanctification. A pure Religion, and undefi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed before God, and the Father.</HI> A better Religion than the Antient <HI>Jewish;</HI> and much better to be sure than the present <HI>Romish</HI> Re∣ligion, where they have a <HI>Catechism</HI> to begin with without the <HI>Second Commandment;</HI> a <HI>Sacrament</HI> without a <HI>Cup; a Bible in an unknown Tongue:</HI> and a Service that can't be understood; and no wonder if they have therefore a <HI>Faith</HI> without knowledge, a <HI>Hope</HI> without a foundation, and a <HI>Charity</HI> that damns all the World but themselves.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="22" REF="002340_0025_0FDB2C58E38EB110"/>
2. <HI>OUR Religion is the best thing that he have: end if we lose that, we shall lose our all;</HI> if we lose that we shall lose our <HI>GOD,</HI> and shall come to <HI>Mica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> doleful Lamentation, <HI>They have taken away my gods, and what have I were?</HI> We may then baptise our <HI>Ic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds,</HI> and cry, <HI>Where is the Glory!</HI> Therefore tho' our honourable <HI>Rulers</HI> have other things to take care of, yet this is <HI>the One Thing needful;</HI> and ought to be secur'd above all. And <HI>two</HI> things are necessary to the support thereof, That a proper care be taken of the <HI>Ministers</HI> of Re∣ligion, and of the Means of <HI>Education.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>OF the Ministers of Religion.</HI> That the Persons that Exercise this Ministry in your Govern∣ment be <HI>Sound in the faith, holding fast the faithful word,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Titus</HI> 1. 11.</P>
<P>MAGISTRATES and <HI>KINGS,</HI> as one observes well, are to be Reformers of Corruption in the Church, as well as of Disorders in the State. Indeed they have no power that is <HI>formally</HI> and intrinsi∣cally Spiritual &amp; Ecclesiastical, but only <HI>objectively</HI> so: they have not the power of <HI>order</HI> which gives authority to Preach, nor the power of the <HI>Keys</HI> by Ecclesiastical Censures; yet they have a power of Jurisdiction over Churches, and ought by their Laws to provide for the Worship of GOD, to root out Heresies, to prevent Schisms and Rents in the Church of GOD, to take care that the order of the Churches in a Country be not Insulted, and tram∣pled under foot; and to see that all things be done decently, and in order.</P>
<P>THEY are also to take care that the dignity of the Ministry be preserved, and the Contempt of the
<PB N="23" REF="002340_0026_0FDB2C5AAB8DEAE8"/>
Clergy prevented, that the <HI>Tribes</HI> be brought in to the house of the LORD, I mean, That <HI>they who serve at the Altar, may be able to live upon the Altar</HI> The Provision made for them under the Gospel is sufficient, and they have power from CHRIST their Master to challenge an honourable Support, a Maintenance worthy of the hardness of their Ser∣vice, and the dignity of their Office, and if they had it they need not prophecy in Sackcloth: and the Mean Circumstances some of them are under, and their oppressing cares, temptations and discou∣ragements, tend not to the furtherance but to the hindrance of the Gospel: 'tis a means to bring the Gospel it self into contempt, and fill the Country with a mean, and insufficient Ministry.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>OF the Means of Education.</HI> The Nurse∣ries and Seminary of Learning, the <HI>Schools,</HI> and the <HI>College;</HI> that our Sons may be as Plants grown up in their Youth, Plants of renown, and not weeds or degenerate Plants. A Liberal Education is much for the Service and Glory of the Country; and the Government should take the greatest care for its Encouragement; that so the Schools may supply the <HI>University,</HI> the University the Churches, the Seats of Judicature, and the Council-board. Unless we are of the mind of the Inhabitants of <HI>Norcia,</HI> who (its said,) had the Liberty of choosing their own Magistrates, but took a most Exact and Particular care that no Man that could Read or Write should have any share in the Government.</P>
<P>MAY <HI>GOD Almighty</HI> bless the <HI>College</HI> and the <HI>Benefactors</HI> of it▪ and may that Society always answer the End of its foundation, Endowment, and Benefactions.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="002340_0027_0FDB2C5BEB881E88"/>
AND let the Laws for Schools be supported with such Sanctions as may break in pieces all the base, unworthy Attempts to elude them, by those who are no Friends to Learning. And let GOD raise up <HI>of our sons to be prophets, and our young men to be Nazarites unto the Lord.</HI> And may the Sons that the College brings forth, prove always the Joy of their Parents, and the Honor of their Tutors, the glory of the University, and a blessing to the Country: Peaceable to the State, and Serviceable to the Church.</P>
<P>IN these things our <HI>Rulers</HI> may be Benefactors to us. You have greater <HI>Advantages</HI> to be so, and greater <HI>Opportunities,</HI> than other Men. You are under greater <HI>Engagements,</HI> and you have grea∣ter <HI>Encouragements:</HI> The People of GOD will Honor you in the gate, and rise up, and call you Blessed; and the Churches of GOD will bless you; if they see your daily care for them, they will put up daily Prayers for you, that the great GOD would recompence all your fatherly Care of the Country and of these Churches into your own Bosoms. The People of the Land will be under no temptation to conspire, or rebel against the Go∣vernment, and meditate Revolts and Revolutions, but will sit under the shadow of your Government with great Satisfaction and Contentment, and the GOD that chose our Fathers to be His People, and placed them here because He delighted in them, will also delight in you, and <HI>remember you accor∣ding to all the good that you shall do for this people.</HI></P>
<P>BUT if you should abuse your Power, and go over all the bounds of your Duty, &amp; Obligations;
<PB N="25" REF="002340_0028_0FDB2C5FD6D45088"/>
oppress &amp; vex this People, and lay heavy burdens upon them, and grievous to be born, you I forfeit the gratitude and regard due to Benefactors; and become obnoxious not only to the resentments of the People groaning under their burdens, but also to the Divine Displeasure; for if GOD has still a Delight in us, He will not suffer us to be wholly oppressed, and spoiled; but He will plead our cause and execute Judgment for us. As Oppression makes a wise Man mad, so it makes a righteous GOD angry.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Nebuchadnezzar'</HI>s Pride and Insolence, was grown to an insufferable heighth, the Decree came forth for His Deposition; <HI>A watcher &amp; a holy One came down from heaven, and cried aloud against</HI> him, <HI>hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit,</HI> Dan. 4.
