<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>RITING is a Talent which, of all Things, I never made any Pretensions to, and little thought of giving at this Time the Publick an Account of my Practice; but being again importuned thereto, by a great and worthy Physician, and having also received a Message from a superior Person, that an Account of my Success of inoculating the Small-Pox in <HI>New-England</HI> might be grateful, as being of great use, and beneficial to the Publick, I esteem'd it as the strong∣est Obligation upon me so to do, and in Compliance to that Command I have done it faithfully. If I had proposed any Advantage to my self, in the Practice here, I should have done it above a Year past, at my Arrival in <HI>London,</HI> and not now at my returning home. And I have given this Account with the greater Chearfulness, in hope, that my Mite may influence some few at least to save their Lives this Way, seeing, from Time to Time, in the Weekly Bills, Numbers who died of the Small-Pox, and hearing of but few who have had the Benefit of Inoculation, compar'd with the others in the natural Way, notwithstanding the many and handsome Accounts which have been given the Publick, greatly in Favour of this Practice.</P>
<P>And it may be of some Service, was it only on Account of the great Proportion of Adult Persons, and others advanced in Years, to whom the Small-Pox, in the natural Way,
<PB N="ii" REF="003259_0009_0FF02D342EBA8640"/>has been most fatal: And yet from my Experience, I may be allow'd to say, that even such have a very fair Pro∣spect of passing well thro' that Distemper by Inoculation.</P>
<P>I began the Practice indeed from a short Consideration thereof; for my Children, whose Lives were very dear to me, were daily in danger of taking the Infection, by my visiting the Sick in the natural Way; and although there arose such a Cloud of Opposers at the Beginning, yet finding my Account in the Success, and easy Circum∣stances of my Patients, (with the Encouragement of the good Ministers) I resolv'd to carry it on for the saving of Lives, not regarding any, or all the Menaces, and Oppo∣sition that were made against it.</P>
<P>I have not, in this Practice, left room for any one to cavil, and say, that my Experiments have not been fair, and full Proofs, that inoculating the Small-Pox is a cer∣tain Means of moderating that Distemper, to the greatest Demonstration. This, the warmest Opposers of that Practice, who have seen my fair Trials made, are con∣vinc'd of; and the only Difficulty of convincing all Man∣kind, is how to make them Eye-witnesses to a Number sick of the Small-Pox in both ways of Infection; and this would do it at once, and very much to their Satisfaction in, and Approbation of this Method. And here it should be considered how rashly our Patients, even whole Families together, rushed into this Practice, without any Physical Preparation, or other needful Provision, especially in such a cold Season as <HI>November</HI> and <HI>December,</HI> being convinced of the Success of this Method: There was no withstanding them: I must inoculate all, without Ex∣ception, they being in danger of having the Distemper in the natural way. In <HI>March</HI> and <HI>April,</HI> indeed, we inocu∣lated none, and but few in the Summer Season. But al∣though this Practice from the <HI>Levant</HI> comes recommended to be made use of in the Winter as the most proper Sea∣son; yet I did not find it to succeed so well, and prove so gentle with us in the pinching cold, as in the temperate and hotter Seasons of the Year.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="003259_0010_0FF02D7C5B4F8FD8"/>I have not used this Practice only to the healthful and strong, but to the weak and diseased, the aged and the young: Not only to the rich, but have carried it into the houses of the poor, and laid down whole Families; and tho' thro' my own Hurry in Business, and their living out of Town, I have been forced to leave them to the Manage∣ment of unexperienced Nurses, yet they all did well.</P>
<P>And as to those six who died under Inoculation, I would observe that Mrs. <HI>Dixwell,</HI> we have great Reason to be∣lieve, was infected before. Mr. <HI>White,</HI> thro' splenetic Delusions, died rather from Abstinence than the Small-Pox. Mrs. <HI>Scarbrough</HI> and the <HI>Indian</HI> Girl died of Accidents, by taking cold. Mrs. <HI>Wells</HI> and <HI>Searle</HI> were Persons worn out with Age and Diseases, and very like∣ly these two were infected before. Neither can it be said, that there was one sound and healthful Person amongst them.</P>
<P>We met with no such terrible Effects (save that Death is terrible in all its Shapes) from the Small-Pox inocu∣lated, as was common amongst us in the natural way, <HI>viz.</HI> Purple Spots, Convulsion Fits, bloody Urine, violent Inflammations in the Eyes, Throat, and other Parts, scarr'd Faces, some who had lost both Eyes, and, as it has been thought, near an hundred one Eye, with many more melancholy Symptoms too tedious here to enumerate; not to mention Parents being left Childless, Children without Parents, and sometimes Parents and Children's being both carried off, and many Families broken up by the De∣struction the Small-Pox made in the natural way. In∣deed, we had some Resemblance of those Effects; but in none where it was not evident, that they were infected in the natural way before; and tho' we met with but five or six cases that bordered on, or resembled more or less those Symptoms, yet it would not have been strange had there been six times that Number; for in <HI>Boston,</HI> and in the middle of <HI>Roxbury,</HI> no one knew who were, or who were not infected, before inoculated; and I verily believe that twenty five, if not thirty of my Patients were infected before inoculated: And this Reason I can give for every
<PB N="iv" REF="003259_0011_0FF02D38D778C230"/>one's believing so, that in all and every one whom I Inocu∣lated, and that had not been expos'd to an infected Air, and which were above one hundred, not any of them had the least Shadow of such Symptoms upon them, thro' the whole Course of their Distemper. However, I do not re∣commend this Practice to be carry'd on and manag'd by old Women and Nurses; no, I would have it carry'd on and manag'd by good Physicians and Surgeons, where they are to be had; but rather than the People should be left a Prey to the Small-Pox in the natural Way, let it be manag'd by Nurses, for I cannot help thinking that even in their Hands, many less would die of the Small-Pox by Inoculation, than there does in the natural Way, tho' in the best of Hands, and under the best of Care.</P>
<P>And for those that have not yet come into this Practice, for their Assistance, until they have gain'd better Know∣ledge, I have given some short Directions how they may proceed with their Patients, when they begin this Pra∣ctice of inoculating the Small-Pox. And if what I have done, in giving this Account, may (with the Labour and Pains which has been taken by many worthy Gentlemen on this Head) contribute to the leading People into a Method for saving their Lives, and their Bodies from many other Miseries that do frequently attend those that have the natural Small-Pox; I shall obtain my End, and the World will have the Benefit.</P>
<P>I ought to apologize, and ask Pardon of my good Friends in <HI>New England,</HI> for this Liberty I have taken, of pub∣lishing their Names, Ages, and Cases, without their leave, more especially the young Ladies. And when they con∣sider how difficult a thing it is, to set Truth in a clear Light in this Case to the Satisfaction of an unbelieving World; and how much room there wou'd have been left to those who are not willing to believe, and that are Wranglers against this Practice, to have slighted, and argued against the Truth and Validity of these Accounts, were it not for those Particulars; for I must stand or fall by these Accounts,: I say, when they consider that it was done for the good of Mankind, they will forgive
<PB N="v" REF="003259_0012_0FF02D7E160BA188"/>me, and upon that Account only I hope and desire to be forgiven.</P>
<P>I do not call upon or exhort the Physicians and Sur∣geons who are already in the Practice, and have used their Endeavours to promote it, nor do I pretend to inform or instruct them. My Design is only to stir up those who have not yet come into and used this Method, and to lay before the People a fair state of the Distemper in both ways of Infection, that they may be appriz'd of the danger in the one, and the reasonable Expectation they have of doing well in the other. My Reasonings and O∣pinions I submit to those of better Judgment, but as we are rational Creatures, we do, or should delight in acting upon Principles of Reason; and those who consider this Method, and make use of it, I think may be said so to act.</P>
<P>I hope the Reader will excuse me for troubling him with some of the Difficulties that I met with. I have been basely us'd and treated by some who were Enemies to this Method, and have suffered much in my Reputation and in my Business too, from the Odiums and Reflections cast upon me for beginning and carrying on this Practice in <HI>New England</HI>; which ill Usage I think justly intitles me to make the necessary Reflections, and relate Matters of Fact in my own Justification, and to recommend and do Justice to the Method, which was so expos'd and con∣demn'd by their Misrepresentations, which have been spread abroad in the World; and to set things in a good Light, that the World may impartially judge between the Parties (if I may be allow'd the Term) which of the two have acted most like Men and Christians, <HI>viz.</HI> Whe∣ther those who have oppos'd and exclaim'd against this Method without due Consideration of, or knowing scarce any thing about it; or those who have consider'd well, been in the Practice of, and have prov'd by their own Experience, or that have seen the good Effects and Be∣nefit of it, and from such Reasons have recommended it to others?</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="003259_0013_0FF02D3BC6CD8808"/>Indeed I can easily forgive and pity those who thro' Tenderness, or in Point of Conscience, have refused the offer'd Mercy, and that have gently appear'd against it: Such, with the Assistance of a Divine, together with the Exercise of their own Reason upon it, may easily get thro' their Difficulties. But for those who out of private Piques, or Views, have exclaim'd and railed against it, and who have trumpt up the groundless ill Consequences that would attend or follow it: Such I leave to sweat it out with just Reflection and due Repentance. As for my own Part, I know of no better Way of judging between moral and im∣moral Methods of Medical Practice, than from the good or ill Success that does, or may attend them.</P>
<P>I have, for Distinction sake, call'd the Small-Pox taken in the Air (only) natural; tho' I know not any Reason why that by Inoculation may not be call'd so too, for I think the distinct, in either Way, to be the most genuine Effect of Nature; and the Difference between them seems only to be, as in that of improving Plants, the one is propagated by Nature accidentally, and the other by Nature with Industry, with Intent to make them better. The one is called wild, the other tame, or improv'd; and as the Ground is good or bad, so will the Plant or Fruit be dif∣fering, more or less: So it will be in the Small-Pox transplanted. Forgive me this Comparison, it may not hold good in strict Philosophy. None of our inoculated Patients afterward took the Small-Pox, tho' they were continually expos'd. I make this Observation lest the Question should be asked, tho' I think it high Time that groundless Scruples should be laid aside.</P>
<P>There is a large Field open for much to be said by the Ingenious and Learned in Praise of this Method, and I hope, good Improvement will be made in, and by it.</P>

<HEAD>THE INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> which had been a Terror to <HI>New-England</HI> since first it paid a Visit there, coming into <HI>Bos∣ton,</HI> and spreading there in <HI>April,</HI> 1721, put the Inhabitants into great Consternation and Disorder. Dr. <HI>Mather,</HI> in Compassion to the Lives of the People, trans∣crib'd from the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, the Accounts sent them by Dr. <HI>Timonius</HI> and <HI>Pyllarinus</HI> of inoculating the Small-Pox in the <HI>Levant,</HI> and sent them to the Practitioners of the Town, for their Considera∣tion thereon. Upon reading of which I was very well pleas'd, and resolv'd in my Mind to try the Experiment; well remembring the Destruc∣tion the Small-Pox made 19 Years before, when last in <HI>Boston</HI>; and how narrowly I then escap'd with my Life. Now, when my Wife and many others were gone out of Town' to avoid the Dis∣temper, and all Hope given up of preventing the further spreading of it, and the Guards were
<PB N="2" REF="003259_0015_0FF02D3EA1D8BBE0"/>first removed from the Doors of infected Hou∣ses, I began the Experiment; and not being a∣ble to make it upon my self, (such was my Faith in the Safety and Success of this Method) I chose to make it (for Example sake) upon my own dear Child, and two of my Servants.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="text">
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">J</SEG>UNE</HI> the 26th, 1721. I inoculated my Son <HI>Thomas,</HI> of about six, my Negro Man, <HI>Jack,</HI> thirty six, and <HI>Jackey,</HI> two and an half Years old. They all complain'd on the 6th Day; upon the 7th, the two Children were a little hot, dull and sleepy, <HI>Thomas</HI> (only) had twitchings and started in his sleep. The 8th, the Childrens Fevers continued, <HI>Tommy</HI>'s twitch∣ings and startings in sleep increased; and tho' the Fever was gentle and his Senses bright, yet as the Practice was new, and the Clamour, or rather Rage of the People against it so violent, that I was put into a very great Fright; and not having any Directions from Dr. <HI>Timonius</HI> and <HI>Pyllarinus</HI> concerning this Practice, I had no∣thing to have Recourse to but Patience, and therefore waited upon Nature for a Crisis (nei∣ther my Fears nor the Symptoms abating) un∣til the 9th; when early in the Morning I gave him a Vomit, upon which the Symptoms went off, and the same Day, upon him and the black Child, a kind and favourable Small-Pox came out, of about an hundred a piece; after which their Circumstances became easy, our Trouble was over, and they soon were well.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="003259_0016_0FF02D81F6168AD8"/><HI>Jack's</HI> Complaints, in two or three Days were over, and tho' he had but a few Pustles about one of his Inoculations, I am inclin'd to think he had had the Small-Pox before.</P>
<P>It was plain and easy to see, (even in these two) with Pleasure, the difference between ha∣ving the Small-Pox this way, and that of ha∣ving it in the natural way.</P>
<P>And as this Practice was new in <HI>Europe,</HI> so it must needs make a strange Figure in <HI>New-Eng∣land,</HI> and more especially so when one or two of our learned <HI>Esculapian</HI> Tribe had made the Dis∣covery how this Practice wou'd produce the Plague <HI>viz.</HI> because <HI>Timonius</HI> told them that it some∣times happen'd that Swellings were produc'd by it in some Emunctory of the Body; and like∣wise they cavilled and said, that Dr. <HI>Mather</HI> had not given a fair Representation from <HI>Timo∣nius</HI> and <HI>Pyllarinus</HI>'s Accounts. I pray'd that they might be read; but Dr. <HI>Douglas,</HI> who own'd them, and had taken them from Dr. <HI>Mather,</HI> re∣fused to have them read, or even afterwards to lend them to the Governor to read; such was his extraordinary Care, lest the People, in time, should have been reconcil'd to the Practice, and taken the Benefit of it.</P>
<P>And upon <HI>July</HI> the 21st, 1721, being a third time call'd to an Account for using this Practice by some Gentlemen (influenced thereto) who bore Authority in <HI>Boston,</HI> I then having seven Persons more under Inoculation, whose Illness were not yet come on: I then gave a publick Invitation to the Practitioners of the Town
<PB N="4" REF="003259_0017_0FF02D406B751F40"/>(who were then present) to visit my Patients, who were under that Practice, and to judge of and report their Circumstances as they found them. But Dr. <HI>Lawrence Dalhonde</HI>'s terrible Account (see the Account at the End) that he then gave of that Practice was such, that none of them saw Cause to accept my Invitati∣on and visit my Patients. Instead of this, and reporting their Circumstances justly and fairly, as it was their Duty, and the People's Right, for them to have done, some of them made it their Business to invent, collect, and publish idle, unjust, and ridiculous Stories and Misrepre∣sentations of the People's Circumstances under it, and the Practice; tho' none of them had ever been concern'd for, or had seen one single Person of them in their Illness, from the begin∣ning of this Practice, to the end of it, except by Accident, save Mr. <HI>White</HI> once or twice, or that knew any thing of their Circumstances, but that they saw them come well and early abroad after their Small-Pox. And not satisfy'd with such unjust Proceedings in <HI>New-England,</HI> lest the Truth shou'd be made known to <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and that our good Success might influence them to use this Practice, <HI>Douglass</HI> favour'd them with his pretended wonderful Knowledge of things which he knew little of, as may be seen in Dr. <HI>Wagstaff</HI>'s Book against Inoculation.</P>
<P>And as for <HI>Dalhonde</HI>'s most surprizing Instan∣ces, the knowing Part of Mankind now believes as little of them as if he had said that their Heads had dropt off, or that Inoculation had turn'd
<PB N="5" REF="003259_0018_0FF02D84839E21D8"/>Men into Women, or any other strange Tho't that might have come into his Head.</P>
<P>I have made diligent Enquiry in <HI>England,</HI> but cou'd never meet with any one who had heard of any such Practice in these Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> until within these five Years past, or that believes there ever was, and especially in an Ar∣my, the most unlikely Place to begin it in; and if began there, the most likely Place he could have thought of to have made it publick to the World. So that if he does not get well-attested Proofs from Drs. <HI>Helvetius, Bollatio,</HI> and <HI>Barre∣ra,</HI> of the Facts, I doubt, for the future, his Affirmation will not have that Credit in the World, as an honest Man's ought to have.</P>
<P>These were some of the Oppositions and Dif∣ficulties I met with in the Beginning of this Prac∣tice, and which was the Means of keeping out hundreds, if not thousands, from coming into the Practice of Inoculation, which might have saved many valuable Lives that were lost by the Small-Pox in the natural way, as may bet∣ter appear when the Success in each way is compared.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> the 12th, 1721, I inoculated Mr. <HI>Joshua Cheever,</HI> about 39 Years old. He had upon the 6th and 7th Days some light shivering and fe∣verish Turns, and upon the 8th they went off, the Scarifications being almost dried up, so that we concluded the Operation had not taken effect.</P>
<P>On the 9th in the Evening (he being well) a Fire breaking out, he run with others to help put out the Fire, and in labouring at it, got wet
<PB N="6" REF="003259_0019_0FF02D43200AAEB8"/>with Water and Sweat, return'd home very ill and full of pain, and continued so all Night; upon visiting him in the Morning, I found him un∣der the signs of a high Fever, a dry inflam'd Skin, full of Pain, with a hard and quick Pulse, and I feared he would have had the Confluent Small Pox. He being lusty and strong, I bled him largely, gave him a Vomit, and blister'd him, upon which the Symptoms went off, and the Small-Pox came out of a kind distinct Sort, and his Pains, and our Fears, were soon over, and in a short time he was well.</P>
<P>His Inoculations never inflam'd &amp; come to run, as is usual, but dry'd away almost from the first.</P>
<P>Until now, I used the <HI>Turky</HI> Way of scarify∣ing and applying the Nut-shell, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which I soon left off, and made an Incision thro' the true Skin, and apply'd a Plaister over; which I found since to be the better Way.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> the 14th, I inoculated Mr. <HI>John Helyer,</HI> of about 34, and my Negro, <HI>Moll,</HI> of 37 Years old. Mr. <HI>Helyer</HI> had the Small-Pox at the usual time, and of a kind distinct Sort, the Symptoms gentle, and he soon was well. <HI>Moll</HI> had a slow Fever a Day or two, and some Pain, which both went off, and her Inoculation soon dry'd up: I suppose she had had the Small-Pox before; and the Reason why the Negro Man and she was so disorder'd from Inoculation, might be from their being expos'd to the Evening and Morning Air: The Weather being hot, I did not confine them before they complain'd.</P>
<P N="17">17th, I inoculated my Son <HI>John,</HI> about 13
<PB N="7" REF="003259_0020_0FF02D861B0878A0"/>Years old; he had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, a small sprinkling of a kind Sort, and the Symptoms gentle; but upon eating Milk, his Nose bled, and he appeared feverish. I forbad the Milk, and both left him. He being a Lover of Milk, a Day or two after, he had Milk and Water for his Drink, upon which his Nose bled, and flushing Heats return'd: After which, Milk was deny'd him, and the Symptoms went off and never return'd again. In lieu of Milk and Water, he drank Teas, which finish'd the Cure, and he was well.</P>
<P N="19">19th, I inoculated Mr. <HI>John Webb,</HI> about 67, Mr. <HI>Joseph Webb,</HI> 50, and his Wife 43 Years old. The eldest and youngest of these were weak infirm Persons, they all had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, and of the distinct Sort. Mr. <HI>John Webb</HI> had an ill turn of Faintness and Oppression of Spirits, at the coming out of the Pox; but when they were out, the Symptoms went off, and he, with the other two, passed gently thro' the Distemper, and soon were well.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> the 5th, I inoculated Mr. <HI>Larabee</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Hunt,</HI> each about 30, Mrs. <HI>Esther Webb,</HI> 19, Mr. <HI>Cheever</HI>'s Lad, 16 Years old. Three of these had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, and of a good distinct Sort, their Symptoms gentle, and they soon were well. Mrs. <HI>Esther</HI> nurs'd her Father and Mother thro' the heighth of their Small-Pox, by Inoculation, before she was inoculated; and they having it so very favour∣ably, it was hoped that she had not taken the Infection of them; but we were soon convinced of that Error, by her falling sick and the break∣ing
<PB N="8" REF="003259_0021_0FF02D4674CC76D8"/>out of the Confluent Small-Pox on the 4th or 5th Day after her Inoculation; and it was with a great deal of Care and Pains that she liv'd thro' it. She also was restor'd to Health in a short time after.</P>
<P N="12">12th, I inoculated a young Gentlemen under 25 Years old, and much against my Inclination, this being the only Instance in which I was oblig'd to Secrecy.</P>
<P>I inoculated Mr. <HI>Edward Langdon,</HI> 25, Mr. <HI>Larabee</HI>'s Servant-Man, about 18 Years old. They all three had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, and of a distinct Sort; the two last had but few in Number, and their Symptoms gentle. The young Gentleman had them pretty full, and (near the filling) for two Days, his Fever was brisk; but upon bleeding and the Use of an <HI>Anodine,</HI> the Fever went off, and he, with the other two, were soon recover'd to Health.</P>
<P N="22">22d, I inoculated Mr. <HI>Samuel Valentine,</HI> about 19 Years old; he had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, and of a kind distinct Sort, the Symptoms gentle; and he soon did well.</P>
<P N="23">23d, I inoculated Mrs. <HI>Thornton,</HI> about 21 Years old; she had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, an handsome sprinkling of a distinct Sort, and complained much of the Soreness; and her Pox continued longer on her than usual, before they fell off and dry'd away; the Symp∣toms were gentle, and in a little Time she was well.</P>
<P>I inoculated Mr. <HI>Nathaniel Langdon,</HI> of about 27, my Son <HI>Zabdiel,</HI> 14, Mrs. <HI>Margaret Langdon,</HI> 20, and Mrs. <HI>Joanna Syms</HI> of 15 Years
<PB N="9" REF="003259_0022_0FF02D8A4780D660"/>old. They all had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, of a very distinct Sort, their Symptoms gentle, and they soon were well; tho' my Son lay two Nights in an infected Chamber before inoculated.</P>
<P N="30">30th, I inoculated Mr. <HI>John Colman,</HI> 18 Years old, and Mrs. <HI>Dixwell,</HI> about 37. Mr. <HI>Colman</HI> had a kind and favourable Small-Pox, as is com∣mon in this Way, and soon got well. Mrs. <HI>Dix∣well</HI> was a fat Gentlewoman of a tender Consti∣tution, she came frightened into the Practice, as most of the others had done; not only by living near the Infected, but passing some Days before by a Door wherein lay a Corpse ready for the Grave, which died of the Confluent Small-Pox, the Stench whereof greatly offended and sur∣prised her with Fear of being infected: How∣ever, she went the usual Time of nine Days be∣fore Eruption, and broke out full of a distinct Sort; but being of a very moist Habit, they fluxed in her Face, about the 7th Day: She had a sore Throat, was often restless, and by Turns had a Difficulty of Breathing, her Fever and Thirst being yet moderate: The 11th, her Pox began to turn; the 13th, her Face became crusty; and the 14th, the Scabs began to fall off, and she appear'd more comfortable; her Incisions grew wider, and run plentifully. All this while we were in good Hopes of her doing well. This Afternoon her two Children were brought to her, just recovered in the natural way, which gave her great Joy, but put her Spirits into too great a Motion; and the Wea∣ther changing cool (I apprehend) she took
<PB N="10" REF="003259_0023_0FF02D4ACFED3D70"/>some cold, for that Evening she was taken with hysteric Fits, which held her about two Hours; but upon the Use of an <HI>Anodine</HI> and some An∣tihysterics, she became quiet, and rested some Hours that Night, and seem'd refresh'd in the Morning, and held it good part of the Day: But the Evening returning, brought on her Fits, together with a new Fever; upon which I bled her and repeated her Blisters, and used many other Means, but to no Effect: The Fits and Fever followed her close until the 17th of Eruption, and 26th from Inoculation, when she died. <HI>Note,</HI> this was the only case, wherein we met with Fits in all my Inoculated Pa∣tients.</P>
<P N="31">31st, I inoculated Mr. <HI>Samuel Jones,</HI> of about 32, and Mrs. <HI>Waldran</HI> of 35 Years old: The former had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, of a favourable distinct Sort, and was soon well. Mrs. <HI>Waldron</HI> suffer'd some light touches of a feverish Disorder on the 6th and 7th Days, and on the 8th they vanish'd. Knowing (thro' her Fears) I had done it the first Time but slight∣ly, I then inoculated her again; which took Ef∣fect, and at the usual Time produc'd a kind di∣stinct Pox, which she easily pass'd thro', and was soon well.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> the 4th, I inoculated Mrs <HI>B—t,</HI> of about 32 Years old, upon a Pimple she had scratched off on one Arm, and on the other, where she had prick'd the Skin, so as to raise a small Drop of Blood: This Inoculation was attended only with some feverish turns, which upon the 8th Day vanished; and upon the 9th, her Fears being great lest she
<PB N="11" REF="003259_0024_0FF02D9005AEE908"/>should take it in the natural way, she suffer'd me to make the proper Incisions; after which at the 7th Day, her Fever came on, and the Small Pox came out on the 9th pretty full of the di∣stinct Sort: She had something more of a Fe∣ver than is usual this way, and about the height of the Distemper her <HI>Menses</HI> came down, which added to her Uneasinesses a few Days; but all went over, and she soon got well. It was strong∣ly reported, that she miscarry'd; but upon strict Inquiry of the Nurse, I found it false and groundless, she not being then with Child.</P>
<P>I inoculated Mrs. <HI>Dodge,</HI> about 20 Years old, who had nursed her Sister, then lying sick of the Confluent Small-Pox, until the 7th Day from her Eruption: She being terrify'd with the Cir∣cumstances of her Sister, I was persuaded by her Mother and self to inoculate her, which I did, by way of Experiment: She had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, with very little Sickness or Pain, and scarce an hundred in all: She was so soon well, it could hardly be said she had been sick.</P>
<P N="5">5th, I inoculated Justice <HI>Lynde's</HI> Negro Boy, about 17 Years old, he had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, and of a very kind distinct Sort, and soon was well.</P>
<P N="6">6th, I inoculated my three Daughters, <HI>Jeru∣sha</HI> of about 10, <HI>Mary</HI> 8, and <HI>Elizabeth</HI> 4 Years old; the eldest had but about 40 or 50, the other two were pretty full in their Faces; and all their Symptoms proving gentle, they soon did well.</P>
<P N="7">7th, I inoculated Mr. <HI>Elias Adams,</HI> about 18 Years of Age, he had the Small-Pox at the com∣mon
<PB N="12" REF="003259_0025_0FF02D4DF18F06E8"/>Time, and full of the distinct Sort; about the height, he was very restless and hot; but up∣on the use of an oily Mixture and two blistering Plaisters, the Symptoms went off, and he got soon well.</P>
<P>I inoculated Mr. <HI>Abiel Walley</HI>'s Negro Girl, about 14 Years old; she had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, of a kind distinct Sort, and was soon well.</P>
<P N="8">8th, I inoculated Mrs. <HI>Pierce,</HI> about 32 Years old; she had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, and of the distinct Sort, and soon did well.</P>
<P N="9">9th, I inoculated Mr. <HI>Thomas Boyston,</HI> about 31 Years old; he had the Small-Pox at the u∣sual Time, and of a kind distinct Sort, a little fuller than ordinary this Way; but the Symp∣toms proved gentle, and he soon was well.</P>
<P>I inoculated Mrs. <HI>N—s,</HI> who had been co∣ming into the Practice for some Time before, and had lived in the Way of Infection above a Month; but now, through Hope and Fear, tho' too late, she submitted to it. The 3d Day she fell sick; the 5th, the Small-Pox appeared, and continued coming out until the 8th or ninth, when she was full of a small, depressed, conflu∣ent Sort, and her Throat was dry and sore; she had no immediate Signs of Danger until the 16th, (she being, as it might be supposed, a breeding, and 8 or 9 Weeks gone) when her <HI>Menses</HI> came down upon her, upon which her Strength failed, and her Spirits sunk. The 17th, she flooded, and began to talk idly, conceiting she was in the Waters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I visited her about 12 that Night, and found her delirious, extream∣ly
<PB N="13" REF="003259_0026_0FF02D918DD35A38"/>cold, and in a clammy Sweat, and her Pulse so low, that I could hardly be sensible she had any at all; I ordered her some Drops of Oil of Cinnamon and Liquid <HI>Laudanum</HI> in Su∣gar, (expecting little from a weaker Cordial) of which she had given her two or three times that Night. I visited in the Morning, &amp; found her much revived, and her flooding stay'd; there was a small imperfect Substance found in the Bed. Afterwards she mended slowly, a vi∣olent Inflammation attending her Eyes, her Face being much swell'd, and her Eye-lids closed; we were not sensible of the Danger, until the sharp Humour had ulcerated the horney Coat of one Eye the Sight of which she lost; she o∣therways recovered and did well.</P>
<P N="11">11th, I inoculated Mrs. <HI>Jane Colman</HI> of about 14, and Mr. <HI>Grafton Feveryear</HI> of about 30 Years old; on both these the Small-Pox came out at the usual Time, of a kind distinct Sort, the Symptoms friendly, they soon grew well. Mrs. <HI>Jane</HI> had about 50 or 60, Mr. <HI>Feveryear</HI> a good handsome Sprinkling; he had lived in an infected House about a Month before ino∣culated.</P>
<P N="12">12th, I inoculated Mr. <HI>Daniel Berry</HI>'s Son, a∣bout 20, and his Daughter about 16, and Mr. <HI>Mel∣vin</HI> about 22 Years old: These three had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, of a kind distinct Sort, and they soon were well.</P>
<P N="13">13th, I inoculated Mrs. <HI>Margaret Salter,</HI> about 30 Years old, a weakly hysterical Woman, and often ill; and tho' she had the Small-Pox ve∣ry favourably, as to Number, yet she complain'd
<PB N="14" REF="003259_0027_0FF02D5430B54CA0"/>much of Pain in her Head, and Vapours, which gave me some Trouble; but in a short Time those Symptoms went off, and she soon was well.</P>
<P>I inoculated Mrs. <HI>Eliz. Melvin,</HI> about 19 Years old! she had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, and of a kind distinct Sort, and soon did well. She liv'd some distance from me, so that I saw her but twice after I inoculated her.</P>
<P N="16">16th, I inoculated Mr. <HI>John Adams</HI> about 35, and Mr. <HI>Jones's</HI> Child, 4 Years old; they both had the Small-Pox at the Time expected, few in Number, the Symptoms gentle, they soon were well. Thro' Neglect, Mr. <HI>Adams</HI>'s Ino∣culations inflamed, and became painful for 3 or 4 Days, but were afterwards easy, and soon healed.</P>
<P>I inoculated Mrs. <HI>Adams</HI> about 30 and her Daughter about 4 Years old; it had no Effect upon Mrs. <HI>Adams,</HI> which a little surprized me; and upon proposing to inoculate her again, she said she remember'd, when a little Girl, the Small-Pox was in her Father's Family, and she ill, and that there was a Dispute between the Doctor and Nurse whether her's was the Small-Pox or not, having but three Pustles; the Mark of one she shewed me. I advis'd her to nurse her Child, which was now ill, and be out of Fear; and she did so. The Child, at the usual Time, had the Small-Pox pretty full in the Face, and had a considerable Fever, attending. I gave it a Vomit, which o∣ver work'd, and weaken'd it for the present, instead of relieving it: The Child continu'd very ill until about the 6th or 7th Day of
<PB N="15" REF="003259_0028_0FF02D9692C2DF28"/>Eruption; when the Pock ripen'd, the Fever went off, and it soon return'd to Health.</P>
<P>I inoculated Mr. <HI>Richard Tucker,</HI> about 40 Years old, of a broken Constitution; he had the Small Pox at the usual Time, few in Num∣ber, good in Kind, the Symptoms gentle, and he soon was well.</P>
<P N="20">20th, I inoculated Mrs. <HI>Eliz. Valentine</HI> about 18, Mr. <HI>Warner</HI> 21, and Mr. <HI>Procter</HI>'s Indian Man 20 Years old; these all had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, of a good distinct Sort: The <HI>Indian</HI> had 3 or 4 uneasy Nights, after which his Rest return'd, and they were all soon well. Mrs. <HI>Valentine</HI> had but very few.</P>
<P N="21">21st, I inoculated Mr. <HI>Nathaniel Ayres</HI> of a∣bout 62, (he was a Gentleman very Asthmati∣cal) his Son <HI>Nathaniel Ayres</HI> about 25, &amp; Mrs. <HI>Elizabeth Kitt</HI> about 22 Years old; she had been in infected Houses and was taken down the next Day, had the Small-Pox full of a good Sort: The other two had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, of a very kind distinct Sort, and few in Number. The old Gentleman was in his Cloaths every Day, for his Asthma ren∣der'd him uncomfortable in Bed. They all soon recover'd and did well.</P>
<P N="22">22d, I inoculated Mrs. <HI>Woodbury,</HI> about 28 Years old; she had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, of a kind, distinct Sort, the Symptoms gentle, and she soon was well.</P>
<P N="23">23d, I inoculated the Hon. <HI>Thomas Fitch,</HI> <ABBR>Esq;</ABBR> his only Son, about 14 Years old; he had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, few in Number, the Smptoms easy, and he soon was well.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="003259_0029_0FF02D5878D08E40"/><HI>October</HI> the 6th, I inoculated Mrs. <HI>Eunice Wil∣lard,</HI> about 22 Years old; she had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, of a kind, distinct Sort, and was soon well.</P>
<P N="13">13th, I inoculated Mrs. <HI>Hannah Breck</HI> of 16, and <HI>Nathaniel Loring</HI> of 12 Years old; these had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, of a kind, distinct Sort, and soon were well.</P>
<P>I should have inoculated these, had I been able, last Night, with Mr. <HI>Daniel Loring's</HI> eldest Son, about 15 Years old, (Brother to <HI>Nathaniel</HI>) who had been sent into the Country about a Fortnight before to escape it in the natural Way; he came home well last Evening to be inoculated; in the Night was taken with the Symptoms of the Small-Pox, which this Day brake out of the confluent Sort: He soon lost his Reason, and died on the 6th or 7th Day. I mention this Case for these Reasons, <HI>viz.</HI> Had I inoculated him as was in∣tended, few wou'd have believed him infected before; and that it may be suppos'd, at least, that the Small-Pox lurks in the Body longer when taken in the natural Way, than when taken in the artificial Way; as has been often observ'd, in many Cases, where People have been but once in the Way of Infection, or that have come from infected Towns or Vessels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="14">14th, I inoculated Mrs. <HI>Martha Fitch</HI> about 16, and Mrs. <HI>Mary</HI> about 15 Years old; they both had the Small-Pox at the usual Time very favourably, few in Number, the Symptoms plea∣sant, and they soon were well.</P>
<P N="26">26th, I inoculated Mrs. <HI>Sarah Boylston,</HI> at <HI>Rox∣bury,</HI> of about 26-Years old; she was at Lodgings
<PB N="17" REF="003259_0030_0FF02D99624A1768"/>in the Country to escape the Distemper: Before her Travail came on, the Small-Pox broke out in the Family; and about two Days after she was deliver'd, her Fear of that being over, she was now distress'd with the danger of having the Small-Pox in the natural Way. My Brother came to me to advise in the Affair, and desir'd me to go with him to see her; accordingly I did, and that prepar'd; and upon both their Requests, I inoculated her. A Coach was provided, and, wrapt up in a Bed, she was brought home to <HI>Boston,</HI> and on the 10th Day broke out with the Small-Pox, of a kind, distinct Sort, and pass'd thro' it without any sensible Danger, and soon recovered her Health, from lying-in, and having the Small-Pox together.</P>
<P>At the same Time, and at the same House I in∣oculated Mrs. <HI>Mary Lane</HI> of 20, and Mrs. <HI>Rebecca Abbot</HI> of 11 Years old; they both had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, of a kind, distinct Sort, the Symptoms prov'd easy, and they being out of Town, I saw them but twice, after Inoculation, before they were well.</P>
<P>I inoculated Mrs. <HI>Blague</HI>'s Negro Girl, about 5 Years old; she had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, as favourably as any of the rest, and soon got well.</P>
<P N="30">30th, I inoculated Capt. <HI>John Osborne</HI> about 36, and his Wife about 33, Judge <HI>Davenport</HI>'s Son <HI>John</HI> about 17, Mr. <HI>Caleb Lyman</HI> about 43 and <HI>Susanna Lyman</HI> about 7 Years old; they all had the Small-Pox at the usual Time of a fine distinct Sort, the Symptoms gentle, and they were soon well.</P>
<P N="31"><PB N="18" REF="003259_0031_0FF02D5A1D252E80"/>31st, I inoculated the Reverend Mr. <HI>Thomas Walter,</HI> Mr. <HI>Samuel Aspingwall</HI> and Mr. <HI>Dana,</HI> each between 25, and 30, they all had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, and of the distinct Sort. Mr. <HI>Aspingwall</HI> had several restless Nights, which obli∣ged me to give him an <HI>Anodine</HI> for two or three Nights following. The other two Gentlemen laughed at him &amp; said he was troubled with Va∣pours. They all in a short Time, were well. These Gentlemen came from <HI>Roxbury</HI> into <HI>Boston</HI> to be inoculated, and lay in one Room; and their Recommendation of this Practice, at their Re∣turn prov'd to be of great Service to that Town, in carrying the Inhabitants soon thro' that dis∣temper, and in saving many Lives, if I may be allow'd to judge from the Success of the different Ways of Infection, <HI>viz.</HI> out of the first thirteen men and they chiefly heads of Families who had the Small-Pox in the natural way, ten of them died; and in above 40 Men that were inocula∣ted at or near the same Time, in the same Town, not one Man died.</P>
<P>I inoculated Mr. <HI>Nathaniel Loring</HI>'s only Child about 9 Years old, his Father being much con∣cern'd for him, on Account of the Small-Pox having been very fatal to their Family; he had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, very kindly, few in Number, and he soon was well.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> the 1st, I inoculated Mrs. <HI>Sarah Bromfield</HI> about 25, Mrs. <HI>Mary Bromfield</HI> 23, Mrs. <HI>Cheekley</HI> 24, and Mrs. <HI>Willard</HI>'s Daughter 18 Years old; they all had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, of a kind, distinct Sort, and were soon well.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="19" REF="003259_0032_0FF02D9AED9FF268"/>2d, I inoculated Mr. <HI>Webb,</HI> of <HI>Charlestown,</HI> a∣bout 32, and his Wife about 28; they both had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, of a kind, distinct Sort, and were soon well.</P>
<P>I inoculated the Reverend Mr. <HI>Ebenezer Pier∣pont,</HI> of <HI>Roxbury,</HI> 24 Years old; he had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, of a kind, distinct Sort, few in Number, and he soon got well.</P>
<P N="3">3d, I inoculated Mrs. <HI>Winslow,</HI> about 21 Years old; she had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, of the distinct Sort, but pretty full. She was hot and restless at the filling of the Pock, which occasion'd me to bleed her; after which the Symptoms went off, and she soon recover'd her Health.</P>
<P N="7">7th, I inoculated Mr. <HI>Ebenezer Holmes,</HI> about 17 Years old; he had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, of a kind, distinct Sort, and was soon well.</P>
<P N="9">9th, I inoculated Mr. <HI>Joseph White</HI> of about 32, Mrs. <HI>Goodwin</HI> 36, and Mr. <HI>Edmond Wells</HI> of 23 Years old; these all had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, and of the distinct Sort. Two of these complain'd a little more than ordinary at the coming out and filling, which soon went off, and they all soon were well.</P>
<P N="13">13th, I inoculated Mr. <HI>Daniel Loring</HI>'s Wife about 41, and her Daughter about 12 Years old; they both had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, of a kind, distinct Sort, and soon did well.</P>
<P N="14">14th, I inoculated Mrs. <HI>Mary Bath,</HI> 15 Years old; she had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, of a kind, distinct Sort, and soon did well.</P>
<P N="16">16th, I inoculated <HI>Anthony Stoddard,</HI> <ABBR>Esq;</ABBR> his Son <HI>Simeon</HI> about 13, and his <HI>Indian</HI> Man about
<PB N="20" REF="003259_0033_0FF02D60C9BCF738"/>21; they both had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, of a kind Sort, few in Number, the Symptoms gentle, they soon were well.</P>
<P N="17">17th, I inoculated Mr. <HI>James Alford,</HI> about 28 Years old; he had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, of a kind Sort, few in Number, the Symp∣toms gentle, and he soon was well.</P>
<P N="18">18th, I inoculated Capt. <HI>Samuel Greenwood</HI> about 31, Mr. <HI>Isaac Greenwood</HI> 18, Mr. <HI>Obadiah Ayer</HI> 32, Capt. <HI>Prince</HI> 28, and Mr. <HI>Lyman</HI>'s Negro Woman 30 Years old; all these had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, of a kind, distinct Sort, but few in Number, and they soon did well.</P>
<P N="19">19th, I inoculated Mrs. <HI>Rebekah Adams,</HI> about 14 Years old; she had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, few in Number, the Symptoms easy, and she soon did well.</P>
<P N="20">20th, I inoculated Mr. <HI>John Gardner</HI> about 18, and Mrs. <HI>Morrice</HI> 55 Years old; they both had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, of a kind, distinct Sort, the Symptoms easy, and they soon did well.</P>
<P N="21">21st, I inoculated <HI>John White,</HI> <ABBR>Esq;</ABBR> of about 52 Years old; he was then a weak infirm Man, and had been so near 30 Years, some time con∣sumptive and very splenetic: Thus knowing his unhappy Constitution, I persuaded him to re∣move further into the Country to avoid the In∣fection. He, tired with a Country Life already, and not knowing when <HI>Boston</HI> wou'd be freed from the Small-Pox, though very cautious and timorous, yet wou'd be inoculated. The Small-Pox came out on the 9th, as usual, of the distinct Sort, the Symptoms easy they continued com∣ing
<PB N="21" REF="003259_0034_0FF02D9DD8253A88"/>out the 10th, and 11th, at which Time he was pretty full of a very distinct Sort, and the Symptoms easy, except that he was splenetic and dull, which he was from the 6th, when he first complain'd; 12th and 13th the Pock came for∣ward, tho' slowly, and of but an indifferent Com∣plection. Now his splenetic Darknesses encreas∣ed, and whereas the first Days he took but little Nourishment, now he wou'd take none, by his Good-will, and refus'd to be spoke to, or com∣forted, notwithstanding he had no Complaints either of Pain or Sickness, Heat or Oppression at his Breast. Thus he lay languishing, and withering away like a Plant without Moisture (the Pock not ripe, and of a livid Colour) until the 12th of Eruption and 21st from Inoculation, when he died.</P>
<P N="22">22d, I inoculated Mrs. <HI>Russel,</HI> 30, and two of her Children, one 4 and the other 2 Years old, Mrs. <HI>Abigail Willard</HI> 22 Years old; these had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, of a kind, di∣stinct Sort; the Symptoms gentle, they all soon did well.</P>
<P>I inoculated, at <HI>Roxbury,</HI> Mr. <HI>Samuel Stevens</HI> about 37, his Child of 14 Months, his Servant Girl 15, his <HI>Indian</HI> Boy 14, Mr. <HI>Warren</HI> 28, and his Brother 18 Years old; six of these had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, of a kind distinct Sort, the Symptoms gentle, they were soon well. The Girl was taken ill the next Day, broke out the 3d of the confluent Sort, had a high Fever, a bad Throat, and with much a do she escaped with her Life, and did well. How to account for this Accident, we were at a Loss, (they liv∣ing
<PB N="22" REF="003259_0035_0FF02D5D2A84EEF8"/>distant from infected Houses) until the Girl was well; and then she confess'd how she got the Distemper: <HI>viz.</HI> About a Week or ten Days before I inoculated her, she went into an infect∣ed House, to see some Acquaintance there, but dare not speak of it before now, for Fear of Anger.</P>
<P N="23">23d, I inoculated Mr. <HI>Ebenezer Pemberton,</HI> and Mr. <HI>John Lowel,</HI> each about 18; Mr <HI>Thomas Dimond</HI> 14 Years old.</P>
<P N="24">24d, I inoculated the honourable Judge <HI>Quincy</HI>'s Son <HI>Edmond,</HI> Mr. <HI>Ebenezer Turil,</HI> Mr. <HI>E∣benezer Gee,</HI> each 18, Mr. <HI>Samuel Dunbar,</HI> 16, Mr. <HI>Samuel Freeman,</HI> 15, Mr. <HI>Benjamin Fitch,</HI> and Mr. <HI>James Varney,</HI> each 14, Mr. <HI>Edward Wiggles∣worths,</HI> (Mr. <HI>Hollis</HI>'s Professor, 32) Mr. <HI>William Welsteed,</HI> Fellow, 24, Mr. <HI>Benjamin Gibson</HI> 21, Years old.</P>
<P N="25">25th, The honourable Judge <HI>Sewall</HI>'s Grand∣son, <HI>Samuel Hirst,</HI> 17, the honourable <HI>Jonathan Belcher</HI>'s Son <HI>Andrew,</HI> 15, Mr. <HI>James Pitts,</HI> 14 Years old. Meeting in this Practice, within three Days such a Number of our College young Gentry (and with them two of their Overseers) I take the Liberty of mentioning them as such, and I hope the Youths will manage well. Fifteen of these had the Small-Pox at the usual time, and of a kind, distinct Sort, few in Number, and their Symptoms gentle. Mr. <HI>Wigglesworth</HI> had the Small-Pox at the same time, of a very distinct Sort, but not so kind; between the com∣ing out and filling of the Pock, he suffer'd, two or three Days, an Oppression of the Spirits, wan∣dering Pains, and Sickness at Stomach, which
<PB N="23" REF="003259_0036_0FF02DA1A41DDD68"/>all went off at the ripening of the Pock, and he, with the other Fifteen soon recovered and did well.</P>
<P>I inoculated at <HI>Roxbury,</HI> Mr. <HI>Barnard,</HI> of a∣bout 30, Mr. <HI>Benjamin Woods,</HI> 23, Mr. <HI>Eleazer Williams,</HI> 25, Mr. <HI>Edward Dorr,</HI> 35, and three of his Children, one 11, one 5, and one three Years old. The three former of these had the Small-Pox at the usual time, and of a distinct Sort (the Weather, it being <HI>December,</HI> was very cold, and the Country-Houses not so warm as those in <HI>Boston</HI>) they complain'd a little more of the Soreness of the Pocks, and of their In∣oculations, but pass'd bravely thro' it, and soon were well.</P>
<P>I shall omit the Account of Mr. <HI>Dorr</HI> and his Children here, and give it with the other Part of his Family, which were inoculated five Days after, <HI>viz.</HI> the 29th of <HI>November.</HI></P>
<P N="25">25th, I inoculated Mr. <HI>Thomas Jeners,</HI> of a∣bout 29, and Mr. <HI>Parker</HI> 26 Years old, both of <HI>Charlestown</HI>; they had the Small-Pox at the usual time, and of a distinct Sort, Mr. <HI>Jeners</HI>'s very few and favourable, but Mr. <HI>Parker</HI> had a great many, and suffer'd a great deal of Soreness, Heat, and want of rest two or three Days at the fill∣ing; which soon went off, and they both did well.</P>
<P N="26">26th, I inoculated Mr. <HI>Samuel Gardner,</HI> about 20 Years old; he had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, of a kind, distinct Sort, few in Number, and he soon was well.</P>
<P>I inoculated Mr. <HI>Tufts</HI> of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> about 31, and his Negro Boy 12 Years old. I was now
<PB N="24" REF="003259_0037_0FF02D65320BA540"/>so much employ'd in <HI>Boston</HI> and <HI>Roxbury,</HI> when their Sickness came on, that when Mr. <HI>Tufts</HI> sent for me, I could not go to them, and only sent Directions, with some few Medicines, and never saw either until they were well, They had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, and of the favourable Sort, as he gave me the Account some time after, when he came to pay his Bill.</P>
<P N="27">27th, I inoculated Mr. <HI>Francis Foxcroft,</HI> of a∣bout 30, Mr. <HI>Samuel Danforth</HI> 28, both of <HI>Cam∣bridge</HI>; and at <HI>Roxbury</HI> the Reverend Mr. <HI>Nehe∣miah Walter,</HI> about 58, and Daughter, 17, his Son, 12, and another Child about 7 Years old, the Reverend Mr. <HI>Thomas Walter</HI>'s Wife 23, Mr. <HI>Harbottle Dorr,</HI> 25, his Sister <HI>Clemence,</HI> 22, Eight of these had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, of a kind, distinct Sort, their Symptoms gentle, and they soon were well. Mr. <HI>Walter's</HI> Inoculation had no Effect upon him. He said, when he was a Child he had an Illness, with breaking out, but they did not know that it was the Small-Pox. This his Mother told him when alive.</P>
<P N="28">28th, I inoculated Major <HI>Bowles</HI> of <HI>Roxbury,</HI> about 37 Years old; he had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, and of the distinct and favour∣able Kind, and soon was well.</P>
<P>I inoculated Mr. <HI>Varney</HI>'s Negro Boy, about 18 Years old; he had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, of a kind, distinct Sort, and soon was well.</P>
<P N="29">29th, I inoculated, at <HI>Roxbury,</HI> Col. <HI>Joshua Lamb,</HI> about 45, his Son about 17, his Niece 13, Negro Boy, 15, Mr. <HI>William Bant,</HI> 23, and Mrs. <HI>Morris</HI>'s Girl, 15, Years old. Five of these
<PB N="25" REF="003259_0038_0FF02DA455FDC6A8"/>had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, and of a kind, distinct Sort, the Symptoms gentle, and they soon were well. Mr. <HI>Bant</HI>'s Inoculation had no Effect upon him: I shou'd have inocula∣ted him again on the 8th or 9th Day, but that a Gentlewoman declar'd that she had seen him sick of the Small-Pox when a Child; his Mother hav∣ing been dead some time, few remember'd any thing of it.</P>
<P>I inoculated Mr. <HI>John Pierpont,</HI> about 27 Years old; he had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, and of a very distinct Sort, an Inflamma∣tion attending his Throat, gave him some Un∣easiness for three or four Days after Eruption; but upon filling of the Pock the Inflammation went off, and he soon recover'd; and did well.</P>
<P>I inoculated Mr. <HI>Edward Dorr</HI>'s other three Children, one of 9, and one of 7 Years, and the other about 18 Months old, his Servant Man 20, an <HI>Indian</HI> Girl about 17 Years old. Mr. <HI>Dorr</HI> would have had these five inoculated when he and the three Children were, but that I refus'd to do it then. But for the Convenience of nursing, they were put into one Chamber, and for better Stowage, two or three in one Bed, (the End of the Chamber being partition'd off for a private Lodging, in which was laid the <HI>Indian</HI> Girl) and by the time the first three were broken out a Day or two, the other five began their Sickness. Here was a melancholy Sight indeed; I had of∣ten three or four, but never nine in a Room to∣gether; the poor Children with their sickness and the Winter's Cold, prov'd froward, one cry∣ing,
<PB N="26" REF="003259_0039_0FF02D681A64F540"/>another coughing; one wanted Drink, an∣other to do its Needs; one to get up, another to go to Bed, and so on; so that together with o∣pening and shutting the Doors, the gingling of the Warming-pan, Fire-shovel and Tongs, there was scarce a Minute in the 24 Hours that all was still and quiet. They all had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, and of the distinct Sort: Mr. <HI>Dorr</HI> was full, his Pock inflam'd and his Fever too high: This, with his great Concern for his Children, the continual Noise, and Want of Sleep, made the poor Gentleman almost distracted, which obliged me to bleed him twice, to apply Epispastics, use Anodines, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> at the turning of the Pock, the Symptoms went off. The <HI>Indian</HI> Girl was taken ill the 7th with a gentle Fever, which continued to the 9th, when the Small-Pox came out upon her of a kind, distinct Sort, she having about twenty in her Face, so that she was easy, and laughed, as I found her half naked, sit∣ting up in the Bed. The 10th I visited the Family late in the Evening, and the Nurse said the <HI>Indian</HI> was very dull, and did not care to speak; I found her very ill, the Pock sunk in, her Pulse too frequent and un∣even: I order'd her near a Fire, and ma∣ny Means were used to get the Pock out a∣gain, but to no purpose; for she died before Morning. Two of the Children were a little fuller than ordinary, complain'd of Soreness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the other five had it very favourably, and eight of the nine recovered, and did very well. The Small-Pox had broken out in Mr. <HI>Dorr</HI>'s House before any of them were inoculated: Tho' I be∣lieve
<PB N="27" REF="003259_0040_0FF02DA72D7659F8"/>the <HI>Indian</HI> Girl was no ways infected before, but was lost by taking Cold and striking in the Pock. She was a weakly Girl, subject to Hu∣mours breaking out upon her Years before.</P>
<P N="30">30th, I inoculated Mr. <HI>Thomas Smith,</HI> 19, Mr. <HI>John Smith,</HI> 17, Mr. <HI>Thomas Goodwin,</HI> 16, at <HI>Charlesttown</HI>: Mr. <HI>Brasier</HI> about 31, his Wife 35, and four, of their Children, <HI>viz.</HI> one of 8, one of 6, one of 3 Years, and one of nine Months old; Mrs <HI>Wire</HI> about 50, and Son 14, Mr. <HI>Webb</HI>'s two Children, one of 2 Years, and the other 10 Months old, Mrs. <HI>Hendry</HI> 25 Years, and her Child 15 months old; All these Fifteen had the Small-Pox at the usual time, and of a very distinct and kind Sort. The three first were in <HI>Boston,</HI> whom I often saw, Mr. <HI>John Smith</HI> had but 3 Pustules that fill'd and turn'd, and but one of them very Fair, so that I can't call this a perfect Small-Pox tho' I know not why these may not defend him for the Future, as well as if he had had but one or two in the natural way, the other two but very few: The twelve at <HI>Charlestown</HI> I saw but twice in all their Illness, I was so engaged in <HI>Boston</HI> and <HI>Roxbury</HI>; however, they all soon recover∣ed, and did well.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> the 1st, I inoculated Mrs. <HI>Foy</HI> 27, Mrs. <HI>White</HI> 24, and their Negro Boy 6, Mrs. <HI>Elizabeth Calf</HI> 16, her Sister 14, and Capt. <HI>Lang∣don,</HI> 26 Years old; at <HI>Roxbury,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Scarbrough,</HI> Widow, 67, her Son <HI>Joseph Scarbrough</HI> 34, and Daughter <HI>Bethiah</HI> 22, Mr. <HI>Timothy Parker</HI> 26, Mr. <HI>Stephen Chute</HI> 22, Mr. <HI>Searl</HI>'s Servant Boy 16, Mr. <HI>Scarbrough</HI>'s Man, about 20 Years old. Twelve of these had the Small-Pox at the usual
<PB N="28" REF="003259_0041_0FF02D6B22EC1810"/>Time, and of a distinct Kind, the six at <HI>Boston</HI> had each but few, and the Symptoms very gentle: The four Men and the old Gen∣tlewoman at <HI>Roxbury</HI> were fuller, &amp; their Symp∣toms a little harsh, <HI>viz.</HI> Pains in their Head, or Bones; sick, or oppress'd at Stomach; and the old Gentlewoman complain'd of being faint: And but little good Rest, or Sleep, did they get for three or four Days and Nights, four in one Room, and two in another, and but one Nurse for them all, and she a Toper. But these Symp∣toms abated as the Pox ripen'd; and as they turn'd, they went off. The Boy had but few in Number, and the Symptoms gentle. All these twelve soon recover'd, and did well. Mrs. <HI>Be∣thiah Scarbrough</HI> had her Illness begun the 7th Day, a gentle Fever, and so continued until the 9th, when her Fever encreased, and she com∣plain'd of her Head, Back, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as is usual, and no more; no Pox yet appearing; she had Blist∣ers order'd, and other Means prescrib'd to bring out the Pox, and that she should be kept warm in Bed, and so I left her that Night. The next Night I found her (unexpectedly, in her Cloaths) upon the Bed, faint and weak, with a faulter∣ing, weak, and dangerous Pulse; and the Nurse told me her Courses were upon her, and that she could not keep her in Bed. I did the best I could for her, (being late at Night, and no Shop at Hand) but to no Effect; she died be∣fore Morning. She had been several Years, as her Mother and others told me, a very sickly young Woman, and never well. In short, thro' my great Hurry, she was poorly Doctor'd, and
<PB N="29" REF="003259_0042_0FF02DA9F6208970"/>badly Nurs'd, and so she died before the Pox came out.</P>
<P N="2">2d, I inoculated Madam <HI>Davenport</HI> about 40, her little Daughter Mrs. <HI>Lucia</HI> 6, Madam <HI>Tha∣cher</HI> 40, Mr. <HI>Philip Serle,</HI> 61, his Wife 63, their Daughter 24, Mr. <HI>Edmond Wells</HI> 58. his Wife 54, their Daughter 19, their Son 16. Mr. <HI>Elias Monk</HI> 30, and three of his Children, one 6, one 4, and the other 2 Years old; the 3 first in <HI>Bo∣ston,</HI> the other 11 at <HI>Roxbury.</HI> Those three in <HI>Boston</HI> had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, &amp; of a kind, distinct Sort, their Symptoms easy, they soon were well. Mr. <HI>Serle, Wells</HI>'s Son, <HI>Monk,</HI> and his three Children, had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, of a very distinct Sort, and the Symptoms moderate. Mr. <HI>Wells,</HI> his Daughter, and Mr. <HI>Serle</HI>'s Daughter, had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, and of the distinct Sort, but a little fuller, and their Com∣plaints greater, <HI>viz.</HI> of Pain and Soreness, Want of Rest, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which at the turning of the Pox, went off; and all these nine, in a little Time, recover'd and did well. Mrs. <HI>Wells</HI> was a ve∣ry weakly Gentlewoman, always complaining and of an ill Habit of Body, and so very sple∣netick as often to be deprived of Reason; and for many Years not capable of managing her Family Affairs. She had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, and of a very distinct Sort, and the Symptoms continued moderate for the first five Days, save that the cold Weather pinched her very much; the 6th, 7th, and 8th Days she was more uneasy, slept but little, grew faint and weaker, the cold Weather affecting her still
<PB N="30" REF="003259_0043_0FF02D6DA4171320"/>more, and the native Heat declining apace; the Pock not filling, she sunk under it, and died the 9th from Eruption, and the 17th from her Inci∣sions. Mrs. <HI>Serle,</HI> likewise, was an ailing old Woman, Hysterical, Splenetic, and of an ill Ha∣bit of Body; she had the Small-Pox at the usu∣al Time, and of a very distinct Sort; the Symp∣toms were moderate, though she was often com∣plaining of one Uneasiness or other, as is com∣mon in the Small-Pox, and the cold Weather, likewise, affected her much. Thus she continu∣ed until the Pock fill'd and turn'd, &amp; the Scabs cast off; one Day a little better, and another worse; sometimes up, and other times in Bed: The Perspirations being stopp'd by the cold Wea∣ther, &amp; a Complication of Humours being put in Motion, at last fell upon her Bowels. She had a Purging three or four Days, which carried her off. She died the 24th from Eruption, and the 33d from Inoculation. All these 11 at <HI>Rox∣bury</HI> had liv'd in the Way of Infection about three Weeks before inoculated.</P>
<P N="6">6th, I inoculated Mr. <HI>Bradford,</HI> 25, Mr. <HI>Jo∣seph Belcher</HI> about 22, his Brother, 18, Mr. <HI>Jos. Richards</HI> 22, and Mr. <HI>Cary</HI> 21 Years old; these five had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, and of a good distinct Sort, not many in Number, nor were the Symptoms harsh; they complain'd of Soreness, and the Weather pinch'd them, but they pass'd soon through it, and did well. These were of <HI>Dedham,</HI> and inoculated at <HI>Roxbury.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8th, I inoculated, at <HI>Boston,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Harris</HI> about 22 Years old; she had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, of the distinct Kind, and a
<PB N="31" REF="003259_0044_0FF02DAD6E707D20"/>pretty handsome Sprinkling; she was very va∣pourish and timorous; full of Complaints, when I was absent; but when present, had few or none. She soon was well.</P>
<P>I inoculated, at <HI>Roxbury,</HI> Mr. <HI>Samuel Williams</HI> about 64, his Wife 62, his Son 36, his Daugh∣ter 22, Dr. <HI>Elijah Danforth,</HI> 35, and Mr. <HI>Bass</HI> 27; all these had the Small-Pox at the usual time, and of a kind, distinct Sort, and but few in Number. The old Gentleman, thro' the cold Weather, had an Inflammation in his Wrists, where he was Inoculated, which gave him much Pain, and me some Trouble. The Doctor, by the Cold, had a Tumour in the <HI>Axilla,</HI> which came to Suppuration. Except these two Acci∣dents, (which soon afterward were cured) they were very favourably dealt with, and soon well.</P>
<P N="9">9th, I inoculated, in <HI>Boston,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Turell</HI> about 32, and a Negro Boy 10 Years old; they both had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, and of the distinct and kind Sort; their Symptoms gentle, they soon were well.</P>
<P N="12">12th, I inoculated, at <HI>Roxbury,</HI> Capt, <HI>Joseph Mayhew</HI> about 57, and his Grandson 11 Years old; they both had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, and of a kind, distinct Sort; the Symp∣toms gentle, they soon were well.</P>
<P N="18">18th, I inoculated, at <HI>Roxbury,</HI> Mr. <HI>Samuel Stevens</HI>'s two eldest Daughters, one of about 11, and the other 6 Years old; they both had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, and of a kind distinct Sort; their Symptoms gentle, they soon were well.</P>
<P N="20"><PB N="32" REF="003259_0045_0FF02D70986E1AC8"/>20th, I inoculated, at <HI>Roxbury,</HI> Mr. <HI>Bernard</HI>'s Maid about 17 Years old; she had been at her Father's some Time to escape the Infection; ta∣king cold, she complain'd of her Head and Bones; they concluding she was taken with the Small-Pox, sent her back to her Master to have it there, and she was put into an infected Room and Bed, and I was desir'd to take the care of her. After she had been kept warm about 48 Hours, her Complaints were gone, and now, thro' Fear, she wou'd be inoculated; she had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, of a kind, distinct Sort, (about 200 in all) the Symptoms gentle, she soon was well.</P>
<P N="24">24th, I inoculated Capt. <HI>Mayhew</HI>'s Maid about 18 Years old; She had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, of a kind, distinct Sort, the Symptoms gentle, she soon was well.</P>
<P N="26">26th, I inoculated Mr. <HI>Samuel Stevens</HI>'s two other Children, one 4, the other 2 Years old, and Mr. <HI>Barnard</HI>'s Son 4 Years old; they had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, of a kind, distinct Sort, few in Number, and the Symptoms being gentle, they soon were well.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> the 28th, 1721-2, I inoculated, at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> Madam <HI>Goff</HI> about 45, her Nephew 12, her Maid 27, the Maid's Child 2, their Man 30, Servant Girl 15, and Mr. <HI>Stephen Hall</HI> of <HI>Charlstown,</HI> about 27; six of these had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, of the distinct Sort; and their Smptoms moderate; all these soon did well. Upon Madam <HI>Goff</HI> it had no Effect; it appear'd afterwards, (by one that remembred) that she had the Small-Pox in her Infancy.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="003259_0046_0FF02DB01F90CB98"/><HI>February</HI> the 8th; I inoculated, in <HI>Charlestown,</HI> Mr. <HI>Kettle</HI> of 26, and his Wife of 23 Years old; they both had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, of a kind, distinct Sort, their Symptoms gentle, and they soon did well.</P>
<P N="23">23d, I inoculated, at <HI>Charlestown,</HI> the Reverend Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> of <HI>Rutland,</HI> 30 Years old; he had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, of a most kind, distinct Sort, few in Number, and the Symptoms gentle, he soon was well.</P>
<P N="24">24th, I inoculated, at <HI>Charlestown,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Hall</HI> about 22 Years, her Child about 14 Months old, they both had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, and of the distinct Sort: Mrs. <HI>Hall</HI> was ungo∣vernable, refused Management and Medicine, expos'd herself in caring for her Child, and took Cold, which brought on new Complaints, <HI>viz.</HI> Pain and a Swelling in her right Thigh; which Swelling continuing, encreas'd her Thigh to a large Bulk, and which suppurated, and upon o∣pening, discharged a great Quantity of undigest∣ed Pus; upon which she became easy, (the Small-Pox being favourable, was now turn'd and gone.) Her Fears prevented me laying open the <HI>Sinus,</HI> I order'd large Poultices of white Bread &amp; Milk, with suitable Compress &amp; Bandage; to be ap∣ply'd once or twice a Day, as the Case might require; which Method &amp; simple Means alone in ten Days or a Fortnight's Time compassed and compleated the Cure. The Child's Symptoms were favourable, &amp; it soon was well.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> the 11th, I inoculated Mr. <HI>Samuel Sewall</HI> of about 34, Mrs. <HI>Sewall</HI> 30, &amp; her two Sons, one 10, the other 8, Mr. <HI>Benjamin Woodbridge</HI> 13,
<PB N="32" REF="003259_0047_0FF02DD637F4AD30"/>and Mrs. <HI>Joanna Alford</HI> 20 Years old; Mr. <HI>Sewall</HI> was a weakly Gentleman, often ill, and thought by many Consumptive; &amp; all the other five of tender Constitutions. And notwithstanding the many Difficulties &amp; hard Shifts they were put to, in being remov'd some Days after inoculated to an Island to have the Small-Pox there, the Particulars too tedious to be related here, but well known in <HI>Boston,</HI> yet these all had the Small-Pox at the usual Time, and of a distinct Sort. Those three who were capable of reflecting on their Treatment, suffered twice as much as the other three did; but all their Symptoms proving gentle, they all did well.</P>
<P>The Small-Pox now leaving us, Inoculation ceas'd; and when it shall please Providence to send &amp; spread that Distemper amongst us again, may Inoculation revive, be better received, and continued a Blessing, in preserving many more from Misery, Corruption, &amp; Death.</P>
<P>There were in the Towns near <HI>Boston</HI> about 36 Persons more inoculated, which all did well, <HI>viz.</HI> by Dr. <HI>Roby</HI> about 11, and by Dr. <HI>Thompson</HI> about 28, which together with my 247, make up the Number of 286, out of which Number died only six persons, notwithstanding all the Difficulties this Practice laboured under, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Now if there be any one that can give a faith∣ful Account or History of any other Method of Practice that has carried such a Number, of all Ages, Sexes, Constitutions, and Colours, and in the worst Seasons of the Year, thro' the Small Pox; or, indeed, thro' any other acute Distem∣per with better Success, then I will alter my O∣pinion
<PB N="33" REF="003259_0048_0FF02DB1A719B078"/>of this; and until then, I shall value and e∣steem this Method of inoculating the Small-Pox, as the most beneficial and successful that ever was discover'd to, and practised by Man∣kind in this World.</P>
<P>In the Year 1721, and Beginning of 1722. there were, in <HI>Boston,</HI> 5759 Persons who had the Small-Pox in the natural Way, out of which Number died 844, (this Account I took from one of our Prints, published by Authority) so that the Proportion that died of the natural Small Pox there, appears to be one in six, or between that of six &amp; seven.</P>
<P>The following Table will shew the Difference between the Success of the natural Small-Pox, and that of the inoculated, in <HI>New-England.</HI></P>

<P>It appears by the foregoing Table, that Ino∣culation upon six Persons did not produce the Small-Pox, by Reason they had had it before. And that out of 286, six died, though they had not all the Small-Pox only by Inoculation, as we have Reason to believe, but were some of them infected in the natural Way, before Ino∣culated. And it further appears by our Prac∣tice in <HI>New-England,</HI> that if a Number of Per∣sons
<PB N="35" REF="003259_0050_0FF02DB370A118C0"/>shou'd be inoculated, of all Ages and Con∣stitutions, and even some of them living amongst the Infected and in the worst Seasons of the Year, without Exception, as was our case, then the Proportion that dies under Inoculation may be one in 46, or thereabout. It is my Opinion, from Reason, and as far as I can judge, from Experience too, that a Person may be infected in the natural Way, four or five Days, if not longer, before inoculated; and yet go the usual Time of nine Days before Eruption. And it is further my Opinion, that a Person may be ser∣ved by Inoculation, if not infected above a Day or two before Inoculated. And the Rea∣sons for such my Opinions are as followeth: 1. That the Infection received by Inspiration does not so immediately enter into, and ferment the Blood and other Juices of the Body, as that does which we inoculate, or apply to the open∣ed Blood and other Vessels in the Incision. 2. That this inoculated Infection does immedi∣ately enter in, and communicate its Leaven like Quality (by the Mouths of the divided Vessels) to the Mass of Humours in the Body. And if any there be of that Kind, it will ferment and put them into Motion, and bring the Small-Pox out in about two Thirds of the Time that the Natural usually does; and that before the deep, secret, and hidden Fermentations have had Time to divide and subdivide the Particles of that Humour, and by a greater Mixture de∣prave the other Juices, so as to produce the con∣fluent Sort. I believe also that there is a Diffe∣rence between the Particles of Infection, <HI>viz.</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="003259_0051_0FF02DDB4BF3FF60"/>those in the natural Way, being more volatile, may be more malignant, than those contain'd in the Pus or Matter of the Pustules: And that if there were no Difference in the Malignity of the Infection; yet as Inoculation communicates the Infection to an Out-side and firmer Part of our Body, the Malignity may (being strain'd thro' so many minute Vessels) lose part of its Force, before it reach the more principal Parts, and that a part of that Infection may be dis∣charged by the Incisions back again: Whereas in the natural Way, our Nostrils, Throat, Mouth, Lungs, and Stomach are the first Parts infect∣ed; or thro' which the Infection passes, and which are frequently the Parts that most com∣plain. And there may be something allow'd me (from Experience) on this Head, when I de∣clare, that amongst the whole Number that I inoculated, tho' many of them amidst the stifling Heat of Infection, and in the extream hot and cold Weather; yet not above three or four Per∣sons had their Throats very sore, and their Mouths fill'd, and Nostrils stop'd with the Pock and Scabs, as are common in the natural Way. And I dare appeal to all that have been in this Practice, whether they have met with such a Case, except the Person has been first infected in the natural Way; which, indeed, may be a hard thing to determine, in any Place, where the Small-Pox may have been before the Person was inoculated. And yet notwithstanding what I have said, as to lessening the Danger of a prior Infection, I would have the utmost Care taken to prevent Infection be∣fore Inoculation: However, that may be of Ser∣vice,
<PB N="37" REF="003259_0052_0FF02DB960509540"/>in Case a Person may have been so expos'd, either thro' Ignorance, or Necessity. There is a saying; that one Sort of Small-Pox the Nurse can't kill the Patient with; and likewise another Sort, that all the Physicians cannot cure the Patient of. It will be easy for any one to guess what those two Sorts are, <HI>viz.</HI> the Distinct, and the Confluent; these two are put in Opposition to one another, as being the Extreams of each, <HI>viz.</HI> the best and worst Sort, or Kind of that Di∣stemper. But however favourable the Small-Pox appear to be, there must be Care taken of the Sick, and not only in this, but in all acute Diseases; and especially in those call'd Eruptive Fevers, by Reason they are more expos'd to Ac∣cidents, as taking Cold, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> flatting, or striking in the Pock, or producing some other Symptom, which has cost many thousands their Lives: Tho' the Small-Pox, Measles, or any other Fever the Patient had, may have seem'd very gentle and easy; yet with a small Accident they are snatch'd away. And who wou'd have tho't it, says the Nurse, if not the Doctor too. But so it is, has, and will be, if not thro' great Care, Skill, and Pains, prevented.</P>
<P>Now Inoculation, at the worst, is but a Me∣dium between the two Extreams, provided it be done according to Art, and the Patient be clear from a prior Infection; I say, it prevents the worst, and generally procures the best, or a kind, distinct Sort of Small-Pox.</P>
<P>And pray let us consider what this Method, in procuring the distinct Small-Pox, does prevent; it prevents the confluent, which, in itself, is a
<PB N="38" REF="003259_0053_0FF02DE0A5BA62E0"/>Plague, and that in a high Degree; some of the bad Symptoms attending which, are as followeth: Purple Spots, the bloody and parchment Pox, Hemorahages of Blood at the Mouth, Nose, Fundament, and Privities; Ravings and Deliri∣ums; Convulsions, and other Fits; violent in∣flammations and Swellings in the Eyes and Throat; so that they cannot see, or scarcely breathe, or swallow any thing, to keep them from starving. Some looking as black as the Stock, others as white as a Sheet; in some, the Pock runs into Blisters, and the Skin stripping off, leaves the Flesh raw, like Creatures flea'd. Some have a burning, others a smarting Pain, as if in the Fire, or scalded with boiling Water: Some have insatiable Thirsts, others greedy Appetites, and will crave Food when dying. Some have been fill'd with loathsome Ulcers; others have had deep, and fistulous Ulcers in their Bodies, or in their Limbs or Joints, with Rottenness of the Ligaments and Bones: Some who live are Cripples, othets Idiots, and many blind all their Days; beside the other Deformities it brings upon many, in their Faces, Limbs, or Body, with many more grievous Symptoms, which the World has had too great Experience of, as being the Attendants of that fatal Distemper called the Confluent Small-Pox.</P>
<P>What this Humour of the Small-Pox, in us, is, or when, and how it is communicated to us, the Learned have not yet inform'd us. If from our Parents, then how shou'd such as have had the Small-Pox before (and consequently then have it not in them) give it to their Children's
<PB N="39" REF="003259_0054_0FF02DBD63B8DDF0"/>Neither are Infants in the Womb freed from that Distemper, altho' the Mother have the Small-Pox while the Child is there. How∣ever otherways it may be, this is certain, that as it is a most loathsome, painful, and destruc∣tive Distemper; so Providence has wisely and mercifully order'd it, that once only, in our Lives, we shall be distress'd by it; &amp; has now, in greater Goodness, discover'd to us a Way or Method how to moderate that Distemper, &amp; to render the Small-Pox, inoculated, no further dangerous than a common intermittent Fever, under the prudent use of its specifick Bark. And shall not the World gratefully accept, &amp; thank∣fully make use of such a Method, (when known) &amp; especially <HI>Great Britain,</HI> which has had so much Experience of its good Effects, and that for five Years following? Shall not they come fully into, &amp; take the Benefit of it? And shall not the Physicians, who are the Medicinal Guides, with the Surgeons, recommend and bring it in∣to greater Esteem &amp; Practice, &amp; save (under God) thousands and ten thousands by it; &amp; make further Improvements in it; &amp; set more vigorously about it, when they consider their great Pattern and Example for it, <HI>viz.</HI> the great∣est and wisest of Kings, their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess at the Head of it; &amp; that it has been used upon their Royal Issue with great Success?</P>
<P>The Small-Pox in the natural Way, has not been less fatal to Royal Blood, than it has been to their meaner Subjects; and shall not such great Examples, and such great Success, influ∣ence
<PB N="40" REF="003259_0055_0FF02DE8E60C1CC0"/>the World, give Credit to, and recom∣mend a Practice which is so very valuable in it self, as that none other can compare with it?</P>
<P>When the World has had Experience of the good Effects of this Method, it will no longer remain a Doubt; but it will be made use of, and acknowledged to be the most certain pro∣curative Means to produce the better Sort; &amp; the only preventive Remedy against the worst and confluent Sort.</P>
<P>And it is, and shall be acknowledged, to the Praise and Glory of God! that whereas a most wild, cruel, fierce, and violent Distemper, and which has destroy'd Millions of Lives, is now (by that happy Discovery made of its Trans∣plantation) become tractable, safe, and gentle.</P>
<P>And it may be further said of this Practice, that if it were not to save the Life of one sin∣gle Person in the Small-Pox, yet inasmuch as it saves from loss of Eye-sight, a Sense &amp; Or∣nament so very valuable and dear to us, and from other Deformities, and from abundance of Pain and Misery to the Sick, and from a great deal of Distress, Charge, and Trouble to the Well; so it would, or ought to be thought, a valuable Practice, by some at least.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding we recommend this Method to be so very favourable in it self; yet howe∣ver, there ought and must be just Allowance given, why some are fuller, and have more complaints than others; as some may have it, more than others, in the Disposition of their Blood, and other Juices, to produce larger Crops, and to bring on, and subject them to
<PB N="41" REF="003259_0056_0FF02DBEEB6705E0"/>more &amp; worse Complaints than others; and more especially those that come into the Practice loaded or filled with other Diseases, not to men∣tion ten thousand Accidents we are expos'd to, more or less, each Day we live. And shall In∣oculation be charg'd with, and answer for these: No: It shou'd rather be consider'd, how much worse it might have fared with them, if they had happened to have had it in the natural Way. And tho' it is look'd upon as Criminal, while now the Practice is but young, to use it upon infirm, and sickly Persons; yet where such Persons are in Danger of taking the Infection in the natural Way, I think it much more criminal to refuse such Subjects, and trust them to the Cru∣elty of a merciless Distemper, who have a much less Chance to get well thro' it, than those who are of a more healthful and stronger Constituti∣on. But where they can be preserv'd from both, I think it highly just and necessary that they shou'd. Women with Child, I wou'd have them to avoid the Small-Pox every way, but if they cannot, let them receive it by Transplantation, and it is my opinion that to save the fruit, it wou'd be best in the middle or later Months than before, and to save the Mother, at any time, rather than to have it in the natural Way. I shall conclude this whole Account with some Directions, which may be of Use and Service to the Unexperienced, in managing the inocula∣ted Small-Pox, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="42" REF="003259_0057_0FF02DEA6CE44770"/>1 IF the Persons you wou'd inoculate are of ill Habits of Body, let them be first purged, vomited, &amp; bled; one or other of these, if not all, as their Circumstances may require, and repeated, as there may be Occasion, once, twice, or oftener; and be dieted for some Time, and that a Fort∣night, more or less, as you may think proper, after they have done taking Physick, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that they may have Time to recruit, and their Bodies to become settled before you bring a Distemper on them.</P>
<P N="2">2. If they are of healthful Constitutions, it may be as well to inoculate them without any previ∣ous Preparation; for if they are ever so well prepared, yet a small Accident may happen to put them into such Disorders, or such Symptoms may arise, as may call for Bleeding, Vomiting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> although these have been used but just before: And I would observe that in all my Number, there was not ten that had any Medicinal Pre∣paration before the Operation was made upon them.</P>
<P N="3">3. Take your Medicine or Pus from the ripe Pustules of the Small-Pox, of the distinct Kind; either from those in the natural Way, or from the inoculated Sort, provided the Person be otherwise healthful, and the Matter good. The Time when this Matter is fittest to be taken, is uncertain; in some it may be on the 9th, others on the 11th, 12th, 13th, or 14th, Day after
<PB N="43" REF="003259_0058_0FF02DC19B32B908"/>Eruption, and two, three, or four Days after the Pox is turn'd upon them; the best is white, even, and thick, and without smell. My Way of taking it, is thus: Take a fine cut sharp Tooth-pick, (which will not put the Person in any Fear, as a Lancet will do many) and open the Pock on one side, &amp; press the Boil, and scoop the Matter in your Quill &amp; so on: When your Quill is full, empty it into a clean dry Viol, and so take what you can, or what you have Occasion for; which keep close stopp'd for Use, and in a cool Place, except you are going to use it presently; for Heat soon ferments &amp; destroys it. And so long as it retains its white Colour, and even Consistence, and that without smell, you may depend it is good. And when it is otherwise, throw it away, wash your Viol very clean, or take a new one, before you gather any more.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Places I have made choice of to inocu∣late in, for the Convenience of dressing, are, <HI>viz.</HI> upon the outside of the Arm above the El∣bow, and the inside of the Leg near, or in the Place where Issues are commonly made; and two Incisions are sufficient for one Subject. Let the Incisions be made with a good Lancet thro' the true Skin, (by pinching of it up between your Fingers) a-cross the Fibres, and about a quarter of an Inch long, such as would receive a com∣mon Pea in case you were to make an Issue, and drop one full Drop (after wiping off the Blood) into the Incision; or moisten a small bit of Lint in the Matter, and put that into the Incision,
<PB N="44" REF="003259_0059_0FEFDA48C648BFD8"/>applying over it a simple Diachylon Plaister, and gently bind it on with a Compress, Fillet, or Roller, and keep them in the House, and from the Air.</P>
<P N="5">5. The next, and so every Day, dress with the same Plaister, or with Cabbage or Colewort Leaves, in order to digest, or bring them to run∣ning Sores.</P>
<P>If at any Time an Inflammation should arise in or about the Incisions, or Pain and Swelling in the Arm-pit or Groin, apply hot Poultices made of white Bread and Milk, to the Sores, (and Swellings, if any there be) twice a day at least; and so continue them until the Inflam∣mations, Pain, and Swellings go off or disappear, which, if you keep your Patient warm, will be accomplish'd soon; continue those Applicati∣ons some Days after, least the Symptoms should return.</P>
<P N="6">6. After they are inoculated, until the 4th or 5th Day, (unless they are ill before) let them eat and drink, sparingly, such Diet as usually they did before, and take gentle Exercise in their Chamber.</P>
<P N="7">7. When the Illness comes on, be it sooner or later, with Sickness or Shiverings, flushing Heats, wandering, or other Pains, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> keep them war∣mer, and from Flesh and Fish of all Sorts, and Cheese and Milk too: And if they appear much
<PB N="45" REF="003259_0060_0FF02DC8D886A408"/>out of Order, put them to Bed, darken the Room, and let them rest. Now let them take all their Food, as Spoon-meat hot, and Drink aired; and if it be a young Child, it may have a Milk Diet, or Milk in its Pap or Gruel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Let their Drink be Water with a well brown'd Toast in it, Barly-Water, or about a Thimbleful of Oatmeal, and four Spoonfuls of Milk boil'd in a Quart of good soft Water, or common Teas, as they may best suit your Pati∣ent's Palate and Stomach; and some may be allow'd good White-Wine in their Drink, more or less, as their Stomach may require, supporting them with innocent Spoon-Meats, and other Harmless Diet, and wait on Nature, observing the Indications which she may give you, and act accordingly; that is, if she is opprest in any Part, and is not able to help herself, assist her; but if she is not so opprest, leave her to herself, for she is the best Physician, when able. And if you err, let it be in under, rather than in over-doing, for such Errors are easier to reconcile, or be recover'd than the others are.</P>
<P N="9">9. Their Illness does usually begin on the 6th, some few on the 7th Day after Inocula∣tion, and the Small-Pox break out on the 9th; it happens sometimes to break out on other Days, tho' but seldom. If your Patient has been ill two Days, and full of Complaints; as for Instance, taken ill on the 6th, and the
<PB N="46" REF="003259_0061_0FF02DEEF13B2A28"/>Pox not out upon the 9th, give a gentle Vo∣mit, either in the Morning or the Evening: And if the Small-Pox does not come out in 4, 6, or 8 Hours after, and the other Symp∣toms do not abate, apply some blistering Plai∣sters, and, if Occasion, some drawing Appli∣cations to the Feet, and renew them daily un∣til the Patient is relieved, and the Symptoms are gone off. And for the better coming, and keeping out of the Pox, let them have <HI>Virgi∣nian</HI> Snake-root, or Sheep's Dung Teas be∣tween whiles, or a little Saffron or <HI>Gascoine</HI>'s Powder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. If they are hot and thirsty, and the drink∣ing plentifully of hot Teas, or other cooling small Drinks (as they may crave) does not take off those Symptoms, and there appear Signs of In∣flammation, take away some Blood, as the Age and strength of the Patient may admit of, and the Case require. You may bleed them, if full of Blood, and the Symptoms urgent, at any Time, <HI>viz.</HI> at the coming out, filling, or turn∣ing of the Pox.</P>
<P N="11">11. Your chief Care in this Method should be at the beginning of their Sickness, to govern the Symptoms (if any bad ones should arise) in time, and to see that the Small-Pox does well come out; which you may know by the Patient's Ease and Quiet (except they are uneasy by their Soreness, which is not to be regarded) in order to accomplish which, when wanting,
<PB N="47" REF="003259_0062_0FF02DCB9472E0E8"/>your Vomit and blistering Plaisters, and some∣times your Lancet, will be of great Service: But be very careful in your Vomits, lest they over-work, weaken, and hurt your Patient, and your Reputation too: You had better give the Patient three or four, than one too strong; therefore, if possible, be sure to know your Vomit. Antimonial are better than Ve∣gitable Vomits, tho' not so safe and gentle.</P>
<P N="12">12. Do not be too free with Anodines, or Pacificks, at the Beginning of the Distem∣per; more especially, until there be proper Evacuation made: And if your Patient should be attended with more Fever than is necessa∣ry, and want Rest, give a Spoonful of the following oily Mixture, every four or five Hours, shaking the Viol well each Time of taking.</P>
<P><HI>Take of Oil of Sweet Almonds, new drawn, and Syrup of Marsh Mallows, of each two or three Ounces, mixt in a Viol.</HI></P>
<P>Or if your Patient requires something more warm, Cordial, &amp; driving out, give them this, as follows,</P>
<P><HI>Take of Treacle and Plague Water, of each six Drachms; black Cherry Water, Oil of Sweet Almonds, and Syrup of Violets, of each one Ounce; of <HI>British</HI> Saffron, in Powder, ten Grains; Tincture of Castor, one Drachm, mixt in a Viol.</HI></P>
<P>Let the Patient take of this, as there may be Occasion, sooner or later in the Distemper, at proper Intervals of Time, a spoonful, more or less, at once, in three, four, or five Hours
<PB N="48" REF="003259_0063_0FF02DF3B9574A70"/>Time, observing to shake the Viol each Time of taking. If your Patient nauseates oily Mix∣tures, give this in lieu of that above, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Take of Milk, or black Cherry Water, three Ounces; Treacle, or Plague Water, one Ounce; compound Piony Water, three Drachms; Diaphoretick Antimony, and <HI>Gascoin</HI>'s Powder, each half a Drachm; Loaf Sugar, six Drachms, mixt in a Viol.</HI></P>
<P>If your Patient wants a Stool, procure one with a Suppository; if too loose, check or stop it; their being a little bound may be well, but their being loose (except in Infants) may be hurtful.</P>
<P N="13">13. However, when there is a real Occasion for Anodines, you must give them as in other Distempers; but Note, that there is not a Ne∣cessity for their common Use here, as is prescri∣bed in the natural Small-Pox; for this inocula∣ted Small-Pox does not affect the Brain and <HI>Viscera,</HI> or corrupt the Blood and other Juices, as the natural commonly does. And in many there is no more Fever than is necessary, or o∣ther Symptoms, that justly may require such Medicines. And in others, where there is a Shew of such Symptoms, they may go off at the coming out of the Pox, or at three or four Days after the Pox is out, and never return again, as I have often seen.</P>
<P N="14">14. I have given but few Receipts, or direct∣ed to but few Medicines; yet more, I hope, than there will be Occasion for to make Use of in one of twenty Patients in this Method; and because I know there is no Want of Prescrip∣tions in the Small-Pox, they being already gi∣ven
<PB N="49" REF="003259_0064_0FF02DCFA83D3560"/>by others; and that the Physician, in Ca∣ses of Difficulty, will use his own Judgment, and order what he thinks most proper to suit the Case, and help his Patient.</P>
<P N="15">15. Generally speaking, (if your Patients are of tolerable Habits, and came into the Practice free from a prior Infection) you will have but little to do, after Eruption, but to watch against Accidents, and regulate the nur∣sing Part; and when any new Symptoms do arise, make diligent Enquiry, and consider well from what Cause they proceed; if you can find it out, the Remedy may be near at Hand, <HI>viz.</HI> if from any Thing you have prescribed that did not suit the Patient, forbid the further Use; and, if necessary, order something that may set all right: If from a Fault in Nursing, let that be rectify'd, <HI>viz.</HI> in Meat, Drink, or Cloath∣ing, up or in Bed, too many or too few; and if they have taken cold, nurse the Part where the Cold began, by adding more Coverings to keep it warm, (be it in one Part of the Body, or other) as well as order suitable Diet and proper Medicine.</P>
<P>Such Rules well observed, may save you much Trouble, and the Patient much Pain and Sick∣ness, and his Life too, in many other Diseases, as well as in this of the inoculated Small-Pox.</P>
<P>There should be great Care taken in inocula∣ting, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Medicine be good, and that the Incisions be made thro' the true Skin, lest the Operation should prove fruitless, and the Patient afterward should take it in the other Way; as two of mine might have done, had I
<PB N="50" REF="003259_0065_0FF02DF826260978"/>not, in Time, inoculated them again, and so prevented that Misfortune.</P>
<P>In case you should have, thro' ill Habits of Body, or the like, any of your Inoculations that will not give way to, and heal with white Bread and Milk, treat them as you would do other common Sores, <HI>viz.</HI> with Fomentations and stronger Digestives, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>FRom my Experience in them that liv'd as well as those 5 who died in the Cold Weather, I would advise those who are weak and infirm, that may come into this practice, and that live in a cold Country, to avoid <HI>November, December, &amp; January,</HI> for I have reason to believe that if Mrs. <HI>Wells, Serle, Scarborough,</HI> and the Indian Girl, had been Inoculated in a temperate or warmer Season, they wou'd have done well. And it may be worthy of Note, that in above One Hundred and Fifty Males, that were Inocu∣lated here, and of which Number Eighty odd were Men, but only one died.</P>

<P>ABout twenty five Years ago I was at <HI>Cremona,</HI> in <HI>Italy</HI> in the <HI>French</HI> Army, where there were thirteen Soldiers upon whom this Operation was performed, of which Operation four died, six reco∣ver'd with abundance of Trouble and Care, being seiz'd with Parotidal Tumours and a large Inflam∣mation in the Throat; one of them was open'd, his Diaphragm was found livid, the Glans of the Pancreas tumify'd, and the Caul gangreen'd. On the other three the Operation had no Effect.</P>
<P><HI>The Second Instance.</HI></P>
<P>In the Year 1701, being in <HI>Flanders,</HI> there was committed to my Care, by Monsieur <HI>Le Duc de Guiche</HI> Col. of Dragoons, one Capt. <HI>Hussart,</HI> taken ill of the Small-Pox, who told me in these very Words, <HI>Ten Years ago I was inoculated five or six times, with∣out that cursed Invention's taking Effect upon me; Must I then perish</HI>? He was so violently seized, that
<PB N="52" REF="003259_0067_0FF02DFA0FA2B368" MS="y"/>he had several Ulcers on his Body, especially one on his Arm, which occasion'd a Lameness thereof for Life. It was not the Fault of the Care of the Surgeon, Major of the Regiment, <HI>De Guiche,</HI> and several other Surgeons who came frequently to vi∣sit him.</P>
<P><HI>The Third Instance.</HI></P>
<P>At the Battel of <HI>Almanza</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> the Small-Pox being in the Army, two <HI>Muscovite</HI> Soldiers had the Operation perform'd upon them; one recover'd, the other receiving no Impression, but six Weeks thereafter was seiz'd with a Frenzy, swelled all over his Body. They not calling to Mind that the O∣peration had been perform'd upon him, believed that he was poisoned. It was order'd by Dr. <HI>Hel∣vetius</HI> Physician to his Royal Highness the Duke of <HI>Orleans, Don Larencio Bollatio, Don Bentura Bar∣rera,</HI> two of the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Physicians, that the Body should be opened; his Lungs were found ul∣cerated, from whence they concluded that it was the Effect of that Corruption which having infect∣ed the Limphae, did throw it self upon that Vital Part, which occasion'd his sudden Death.</P>

<P>At a Meeting by Publick Authority in the Town-House of <HI>Boston,</HI> before His Majesty's Justices of the Peace and the Select-Men; the Practitioners of Physick and Surgery being called before them, concerning <HI>Inocula∣tion,</HI> agreed to the following Conclusion.</P>
<P>A Resolve upon a Debate held by the Physicians of <HI>Boston,</HI> concerning Inoculating the Small-Pox, on the twenty first Day of <HI>July,</HI> 1721.</P>
<P>IT appears by numerous Instances, That it has prov'd the Death of many Persons soon after the Operation, and brought Distempers upon many o∣thers which have in the End prov'd deadly to 'em.</P>
<P>That the natural tendency of infusing such malig∣nant Filth in the Mass of Blood, is to corrupt and putrify it, &amp; if there be not a sufficient Discharge of that Malignity by the Place of Incision, or elsewhere, it lays a Foundation for many dangerous Diseases.</P>
<P>That the Operation tends to spread and continue the Infection in a Place longer than it might other∣wise be.</P>
<P>That the continuing the Operation among us is likely to prove of most dangerous Consequence.</P>

<P><HI>By the Select-Men of the Town of Boston,</HI> July 22d.</P>
<P>The Number of Persons, Men, Women and Chil∣dren that have died of the Small-Pox at <HI>Boston,</HI> from the middle of <HI>April</HI> last (being brought here then by the <HI>Saltertuda's</HI> Fleet) to the 23d of this Instant <HI>July</HI> (being the hottest and the worst Season of the Year to have any Distemper in) are, <HI>viz.</HI> 2 Men Strangers, 3 Men, 3 young Men, 2 Women, 4 Chil∣dren, 1 Negro Man, 1 Negro Woman, and 1 <HI>Indian</HI> Woman, 17 in all; of those that have had it, some are well recovered, and others in a hopeful and fair Way of Recovery.</P>

<P>It is a thousand pities our Select-Men made so slight and trifling a Representation of the Small-Pox, that had always prov'd so fatal in <HI>New-England,</HI> as they seem to have done in this Advertisement.</P>
