<P>THE Public will readily concur with me, in the propriety of addressing to YOUR EXCELLENCY a Sermon on the safety, Peace, and happiness of my Country; to all which Your counsels were so mani∣festly conducive, during Your patriot administration of the affairs of this government. But whatever indul∣gence may be given to this discourse, on account of the subject, and of Your protection: nothing less than the authority of Your request could have induced me, to publish Sentiments intended only for a small and candid audience; and which are more expressive of an honest Love for my Country, than of the correct or instructive writer▪ I could indeed willingly resign any pretensions

<P>IT is not my province to particularize the faithful services, by which, in Your public station, You have always consulted the safety and promoted the welfare of HIS MAJESTY's <HI>American</HI> dominions. Those im∣portant benefits are recorded in the hearts of all who wish well to these Colonies. I therefore only con∣gratulate YOUR EXCELLENCY, that Your generous labours and patriot counsels, as far as they have contributed to our present greatness, have been crowned with a felicity beyond your virtuous am∣bition.

<HEAD>THE PRAYER.</HEAD>
<P>GREAT and mighty <HI>GOD,</HI> who art exalted far above all praise, and whose eternal majesty reigneth over all: we adore thine universal love displayed in all thy works; we praise thee for our being and preservation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and above all, for the pure light of the glorious Gospel of <HI>JESUS CHRIST,</HI> by whom thou hast <HI>reconciled the world to thyself;</HI> who hath taught us to <HI>know thee, the only GOD;</HI> and hath obtained for his faithful servants <HI>life and im∣mortality.</HI></P>
<P>O <HI>GOD,</HI> in thy hand is power and might, thou rulest in the kingdoms of men, and thou alone givest Greatness and Strength. We this day praise and extol thy name, for the abundant manifestations of thy favour and protection to us, our nation, and our King. Adoring the providence of thy Goodness, we look back with praise and wonder, on the dan∣gers from which thou hast preserved us, on the deliverances thou hast granted us, and the successes with which thou hast prospered us, during an extensive and calamitous war. To thy favour and mercy we thankfully ascribe the Enlarge∣ment

of our dominion, the protection of our lives, our pro∣perty, our freedom and religion, and of every thing that is most dear to us. We devoutly praise thee, for restoring to the nations the great blessing of Peace, and putting an end to the desolation of War. Thy wisdom, ever producing good from evil, can make even the fury and confusion of War, to advance among mankind the cause of truth and virtue. Grant that our past calamities, may correct and reform our sins and vices. So rule the hearts, and restrain the ambition of Princes, the crimes and impiety of mankind; that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Peace which thou hast given us may be secure and l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sting.

<P>Accept, <HI>O LORD,</HI> our peculiar Praises, for the various blessings thou hast conferred on this Province in particular; by preserving it from Invasion, Famine, Sickness, and giving us in all our settlements, even in the midst of war, the tran∣quillity of Peace: by relieving us after the time that thou hadst afflicted us with droughth and scarcity; renewing the face of the earth, and filling us with Plenty. O continue and complete the bounties of thy Providence. Give us true Repentance, and pardon our great and innumerable sins, which render us unworthy <HI>the least of all thy mercies.</HI> Bless the <HI>GOVERNOUR,</HI> the Magistrates, and Ministers, of this Province.

<P>OUR FATHER which art in heaven! Hallowed be thy name: Thy Kingdom come: Thy will be done in Earth, as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread: And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us: And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from Evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. AMEN.</P>

<P>THIS psalm, by the consent of most interpreters, was composed after the return of the Jews from the Baby∣lonian captivity, to celebrate the divine goodness in the restoration and felicity of their commonwealth. It is a na∣tural and elegant description of the general Providence of GOD over his people, and of the PEACE and Tranquillity they enjoyed under the Persian monarchs, especially under Cyrus and the el∣der

As the verses read to you contain a summary of our own public happiness: In the view of assisting your pious sentiments, I shall begin and end my discourse with the duty and tribute of Praise to GOD, which is the purpose of this solemnity: and shall make a recital of those n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tional blessings, included in and connected with the General Peace, the great subject of our present thankfulness.</P>
<P><HI>O Prai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Lord, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it is a good t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> praises unto our God; yea, a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oyful and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> it is to be thank<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul.</HI> Thus auspiciously the Psalmist enters on the subject of the felicity of his Country, by beginning at the source from whence it was de∣rived. Praise is the natural expression, the overflowing of a thankful heart. The benefits received from the goodness of GOD are the causes of religious thankfulness: which will always rise in proportion to the sense and conception we have of that amiable attribute. This is no time to insist on the arguments, which support a truth so obvious, as that the World is gover∣ned by a beneficent Providence. This is among <HI>the first princi∣ples</HI> of natural religion, as well as <HI>of the doctrine of Christ</HI>; who extend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the idea of a divine super intendence, so far as to assure us, that <HI>not a sparrow falls to the ground, without our heavenly Fa∣ther</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. But whatever doubts some may have weakly entertain∣ed concerning a particular Providence; regarding the affairs and
<PB N="3" REF="009329_0012_1030ED3827014290" MS="y"/>
conduct of individuals: all, who believe a GOD, have concur∣red in adoring his dispensations in the public interests of hu∣man Society, in the rise and declension of kingdoms, in the great events of war and peace, and above all, in preserving and extending true Religion. On these depend the order and happi∣ness of civil life: in these, as they now affect ourselves, I think we may discern the hand of GOD, <HI>great in counsel and mighty in work.</HI> And when the greatest national blessings are showered upon us from the riches of His goodness: the ingenuousness of the human mind, the wisdom of civil government, and the au∣thority of religion, incline and oblige us to praise and thank the author of all happiness. Praise, considered as a species of Prayer to GOD, is neither of use to convey our sentiments, as if they were unknown to Him, from whom nothing is hid; nor is to be supposed acceptable to Him, on account of any subserviency to His glory and perfection. But the simple intention of all Prayer and Praise, is to exercise in ourselves virtuous and devout affec∣tions; a trust and dependence on GOD, and a consciousness of his <HI>moral</HI> Providence, by which he hath inseparably connected hap∣piness with virtue, in the whole plan of divine government. If we are attentive to the intrinsic nature of all religious acts; we must be sensible that no Praise can be acceptable to GOD, but as it proceeds from his virtuous and sincere worshippers. <HI>The righteous shall praise thy name</HI>: and, <HI>Rejoice in the Lord, O ye righ∣teous; for it becometh well the j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t to be thankful</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">PSALM CXL. 13. XXXIII. I.</NOTE>. As it is a pro∣fanation of His benefits, to misuse them to vice; or even to esti∣mate them only in a selfish and secular view: so the best im∣provement of the divine savour, is to consider it as a motive to virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="009329_0013_1030ED3F4F8897D0"/>To thus improve our recent blessings, and in some degree to proportion our gratitude for them: let us weigh and consider their moment and importance; and raise our affections, to just sentiments and expressions of love, adoration, praise and duty. To this end, we must enlarge our hearts and minds, to take in the idea of public felicity, to comprehend the welfare of the hu∣man race, and to conceive the influence both of the past war and present Peace on the Civil and Religious interests of man∣kind.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH our attention is principally fixed on the blessing of the Peace; yet this does not exclude other subjects of Thank∣fulness, which croud upon our thoughts on this solemnity. These, the author of this psalm in part presents to our view, in those exulting expressions. <HI>Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem! praise thy God, O Sion! for he hath made fast the bars of thy gates, and hath blessed thy children within thee.</HI> It is a beautiful image, familiar to the sacred writers, to represent <HI>Jerusalem</HI> and <HI>Sion</HI> (the capital and citadel of their country) as the mother of all its cities and in∣habitants: and this manner of personifying the metropolis of Judaea is still to be seen on the coins and medals of Antiquity. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">particularly those of VESPASIAN and TITUS, on which Judaea is represented in the attitude so pathetically described by the prophet JEREMIAH, in his <HI>Lamentations.</HI> See <HI>Cabnet</HI>'s dict of the Bible▪ III. 548.</NOTE> A remark of this kind may give some light to the stile of Scrip∣ture: Nor does this image unaptly express that dependence which we ourselves, as Colonies, have on our mother-Country. During this calamitous war, we have experienced such a pro∣tection from it, as with the utmost propriety claims our praises
<PB N="5" REF="009329_0014_1030ED434FDE4568"/>
to GOD, for His blessings to her children: blessings so great, both to Us and our parent-kingdoms, that our Nation hath never been at so exalted an highth of glory and prosperity, as in this auspicious year. Every advantage, that can protect or adorn a people, is now poured upon us in full measure; and all, im∣proved in the possession, by the striking contrast of the dangers and calamities, from which both EUROPE and AMERICA have just emerged.</P>
<P>WE have seen, for some years past, war and desolation let loose on all the world. In the estimation of a benevolent heart, even our splendid victories have been dearly purchased, by the destruction of the human species, both on our own and the enemies part. Disease and Infection have been auxiliaries to the wide wasting Sword; and innumerable unknown disasters have concurred in depopulating mankind. Scarcity and Famine have combined in the general ruin; while, either the fury of men hath destroyed the means of subsistence; or GOD, to punish their crimes, hath withheld the fertility of the Earth, and given successive seasons of drougth and barrenness. But it is impossi∣ble to collect the materials of calamity, or even for the imagi∣nation to comprehend them all; as they have appeared in all parts of the world, during the whole continuance of the war. If we ourselves have seen less of these distresses, than other coun∣tries, or than other parts of our own; if we have known them ra∣ther by report than experience; this should be considered as our singular felicity, an unmerited distinction in our favour, that should excite the warmest emotions of praise and thankfulness.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="009329_0015_1030ED44DF3F0600"/>AMONG the many blessings of this Year, which GOD hath so <HI>crowned with his goodness</HI>; he hath not only <HI>given us Peace in our borders,</HI> but hath <HI>filled us wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the fit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r of</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, the best produc∣tions of an exuberantly fertile Season. This bounty is so con∣spicuous, that it would be blindness not to discern, impiety not to acknowledge it <HI>with thanksgiving,</HI> and <HI>sing praises unto our</HI> GOD, <HI>who cove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eaven with clouds, and prepareth rain for the earth, and maketh the grass to grow upon the mountains.</HI> The varieties in the ordinary course of things afford the clearest proofs of an interposing Providence. Was the natural world left entirely to the original laws of matter and motion, without a divine Mind to continually regulate them, those laws would al∣ways act mechanically and uniformly. Thus, Philosophers have demonstrated, that the mechanical effect of what is called Attrac∣tion, in the system of the world, would be the destruction of the system; did not an omnipotent mind so attemper those irregu∣larities, as to maintain the order of the universe. The varieties in nature are the interpositions of GOD. The common effects of Droughth and Heat, would always go on increasing with their cause: and the course of nature, left to itself, would be still more confirmed in barrenness and scarcity. A change of sea∣sons, from excessive Dryness to abundant Rains, being opposite to the mechanical process of Nature, manifests a divine superin∣tendence. Thus in the renovation of the almost exhausted powers of vegetation, GOD <HI>hath not left himself without witness, in giving rain from heaven, and a fruitful season; filling our hearts with f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and gladness.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">ACTS XIV. 17. vid. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>CL XXXVIII. 25—3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> As a farther claim to our thanks and duty, we must not omit the general Health

Thus <HI>the</HI> LORD, <HI>rejoicing in his works, renews the face of the Earth</HI>; and repairs the decays of his past visitations, War, scarcity, and sickness, by an extraor∣dinary indulgence of health, fertility, and Peace. HE GIVETH PEACE IN THY BORDERS. Peace, the best of all our civil bles∣sings, let us ingeminate with grateful hearts and voices, till the incense of our Praise reaches to the Heavens, and ascends to the throne of GOD.</P>
<P>THE general advantages of Peace are too obvious to need a recital: whether as putting an end to the calamities of a state of War; or as attended with Tranquillity and Opulence, Free∣dom, Science, and the Arts that are necessary or ornamental to social life. I shall not therefore detain you on this topic; but shall consider the present Peace, more especially as it affects our∣selves in these colonies. Without entering far into political dis∣cussions, (which would be to step out of my province, into one foreign to my place and duty, as well as to my ability) we may all discern the advantageous situation in which the happy con∣clusion of the war hath placed us. Our Country hath been, from its first settlement, a disputed prize between us and our rivals the French. Other nations too have put in their claims among us, and have possessed the finest territories on the Continent; which have been ceded to us by several treaties. FRANCE hath remained a continual <HI>thorn in our sides</HI>: their colonies have been the schools of superstition and cruelty, wherein the native barbarity of the Indians, hath been trained to the utmost fierceness and hatred a∣gainst
<PB N="8" REF="009329_0017_1030ED5247B14CA0"/>
us: and their projects of dominion have been vast and poli∣tic. The injustice of France led them, prematurely for their own purpose, but providentially for our safety, to anticipate the war by incroaching on our settlements in a time of profound Peace. They had, with every art of human policy, formed the ambitious plan, of surrounding and limiting our territory, with the view of more easily invading and dispossessing us: and they had pro∣ceeded so far in the <HI>execution</HI> that, to all appearance, they had not left it in our power to prevent it, by the utmost exertion of <HI>our own</HI> strength. But GOD looked down from heaven, as he did of old on the builders of Babel.—<HI>Behold, this they begin to do, and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">GEN.

<P><PB N="9" REF="009329_0018_1030ED5595D0BB68"/>REFLECT on the improbability, that so extensive a Country, to which so many different nations had their respective claims, should, in so short a time, become the rightful possession of the ENGLISH ONLY, to the exclusion of every competitor. History affords no parallel to it, not even in the mighty growth of the RO∣MAN republic; which (as its best historian <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">— Quae ab exiguis profecta initiis, eo creverit, ut jam magnitudine laboret suâ. LIV. proëm. lib. 1.</NOTE> observes) 'in∣creased from the smallest beginnings, to a Greatness, that labour∣ed with its own weight.' It is, on the contrary, the peculiar hap∣piness of OUR country, that it is capable (under proper regula∣tions,) of perpetual improvements, without endangering its safe∣ty by the effects of its own opulence. It will for ages admit of vast numbers of settlers from all the protestant coun∣tries of Europe; to cultivate in security our fertile lands, to en∣rich themselves by arts and industry, and to enjoy the freedom of our government and purity of Religion. Our climate natu∣rally produces hardy bodies and active minds. While the sla∣vish African and the effeminate Asiatic bow beneath the yoke of savage tyranny; Liberty and Reason make fair amends for the inclemencies of our less genial sky. Our Country will always find sufficient employment for its inhabitants, in <HI>agriculture</HI> and a <HI>simple commerce:'</HI> a circumstance, which in the natural course of things, will retard the corruption of manners and de∣pravation of Religion; effects chiefly to be dreaded from an <HI>iniquitous</HI> and <HI>excessive</HI> Trade, and an inundation of wealth and luxury.

<P>To fix your attention on that superintendence, which it is atheism to exclude from these great revolutions; the cause in which the nation hath been engaged was such as might even deserve the protection of the Deity: a cause the most just, and most interesting to mankind, that perhaps ever influenced the fate of Empire.

<P>WHEN we thus reflect on the many civil advantages to our Continent, and to the whole British empire, resulting from a war so successfully conducted, and terminated by so beneficial a Peace; we cannot but wonder at that spirit of faction, murmuring, and insatiable political avarice, which amidst these ample glories, still repines for more; and clamours for yet greater accessions of wealth and territory. This is worse than disloyalty to a most excellent King; it is an impious ingratitude to the providence of GOD. Too much of this ill temper; (the popular effect of an overgrown prosperity, which kicks against the hand that feeds it) has prevailed in our mother-Country: where the only danger to Liberty is from its own excesses. May heaven avert from us the infatuation of discord, repining, and disaf∣fection! As we have the greatest share in the blessings of the Peace, we should have the deepest sense and express the fullest
<PB N="12" REF="009329_0021_1030ED61324C5BA8"/>
acknowledgment of them: grateful to the wisdom and bene∣volence of our august and gracious King; thankful, beyond the utmost expression of our praises, to HIM who governs the hearts of Princes, and <HI>ruleth in the kingdoms of men.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is indeed some cloud over the happy face of things on this continent, from the commotions of the Southern <HI>In∣dians</HI>; which, like a baleful smoke, have arisen from the ashes of the recent war. But if we may be permitted to conjecture the effect of these incursions; we may hope and trust in the divine goodness, that they will eventually complete the public tranquillity: either by obliging the Indians to <HI>recede,</HI> from our frontiers; or, by preventing their <HI>communication</HI> with the French; or lastly, by what is of all the most desirable, a <HI>firm treaty of Peace</HI> with them. Such a treaty might ascertain their territory, and lead them to a state of civility and settlement; it might induce them to throw themselves on the humanity of our nation, and to learn from us the arts of life; it might open the way to an equitable and mutually beneficial commerce. Their experience of our national humanity, justice, and fair dealing, would conciliate their confidence and good opinion: and this would go a great way towards recommending the Gospel to their reception. If they are not introduced to the knowledge of it by these previous steps of humanity, commerce, and social life; I think it must for ever be impracticable to fix on their minds any rational and lasting impressions of the Christian Religion. The experience of all ages since the Church hath been
<PB N="13" REF="009329_0022_1030ED62C69D2938"/>
destitute of miracles, demonstrates, that no great good can be done by religious missions for the conversion of Infidels, till the two objects, hitherto kept distinct, of <HI>Civilizing</HI> and <HI>Saving,</HI> are joined in one consistent design; and act uniformly in concert to support each other. Civility will prepare them to admit Religion; and Religion will prevent them from falling back into barbarism. Even in human sciences, and much more in the divine science of Redemption, there is required not only the ability and faithfulness of the teacher, but the capacity, incli∣nation and perseverance of the learner. And it is not rational to expect such dispositions from Savages always in arms or hunt∣ing or pillage, never fixed to any residence, and characterized by the inconstancy of their manners. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ou il ne reste plus d'hommes, il n'y a plus d' eglifes. et comment con∣vertir des brutaux toujours armez, toujours courans au pillage, et dont on n'entend pas la langue? <BIBL>FLEURY, III<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ours sur l'hist.

<P>CLEAR as I am in my own opinion on this important subject, (which never can be more seasonably considered, than in this time and situation of public affairs) I mean not to represent the conversion of the Indians as a work that should be neglected. It is, I think, incumbent on <HI>all who love our Lord</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>in sincerity,</HI> to assist and encourage every attempt to bring these savage nations out of their darkness, into the light of His Gos∣pel. The use of these sentiments, is, at this time especially, to lead considerate persons, to examine the best methods of making such attempts successful. And this I suppose can no otherwise
<PB N="14" REF="009329_0023_1030ED64565E0360"/>
be effected, than by some extraordinary effort of the Govern∣ment, both here and in Britain. Great things might be expect∣ed, should the present Indian war be happily terminated by treaties of Peace and Commerce, with an express stipulation in regard to Religion. If they are thus brought under the protection of our King; the civil power and humanity of the nation may lead the way, by all the steps before traced out, to introduce with authority and influence such a system of Religion, as may be not only rationally taught, but rationally heard and learned. Other methods, particularly that of Schools and Seminaries for the Indian Youth, may be made very useful, in subserviency to a royal and national encouragement. The Royal favour has been extended, among us, to seats of Learn∣ing commodiously placed for this purpose. And, as we actu∣ally see such a disposition in our King; may we not venture to assert that it is peculiarly incumbent on Princes, to be in this instance the <HI>nursing Fathers</HI> of the Church? The <HI>pretensions</HI> of extending the Gospel to the nations of America, are perhaps the first claim Europeans originally had to their territories in this new world. Those claims indeed are confirmed to the present occupants, by the same title as all other dominion▪ by discovery, conquest, treaty, and prescription. Yet the honour and virtue of Christian states, is essentially interested in making good their original claim; by exerting their power in communi∣cating those heavenly blessings which would be a rich alternative for an useless and unoccupied territory. The plea of enlarging the kingdom of CHRIST by the conversion of Infidels, hath been indeed made the abominable pretence of much perfidy, cruelty

and usurpation both by the French and Spaniards. But as nothing of this kind has ever disgraced▪ or is to be apprehended from, the equity of the English nation: we may therefore hope that GOD will make <HI>thou</HI> his instruments to accomplish his will: <HI>For thus saith the</HI> LORD GOD <HI>behold I will lift up mine h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people:—and kings shall be thy nursing-fathers, and queens thy nursing-mothers: and thou shalt know that I am the</HI> LORD. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>ISAIAH LXIX. 22, 23.</BIBL><P>Even should the Indians ever learn Christianity, it is much to be feared it will be in the same manner an excellent Church-historian describes the con∣version of the Goths. <HI>'Les barbares, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n dev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nant Chr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tiens, ne quitterent pas en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ierement leurs anciennes m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rs: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>meurerent la plus part l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gers, chang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, emporte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; agissans plus pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> passion, que par raison—Ces p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ples continu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ient daus leur mepris pour les Latres et pour les arts, ne s' c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>pant que de la chasse et de la guerre.'</HI> FLEURY.

<P>THE accomplishment of this and many other magnificent prophecies, relating both to the purity and propagation of the Gospel, may perhaps be greatly influenced by the present PEACE: whose effects on the RELIGION of mankind may now, in the last place, be usefully attended to. That which is our most glorious distinction, the Christian and the Protestant Religion, hath re∣ceived such advantages from the prosecution of the war and its happy conclusion▪ that they open to us an ample field of Praise and admiration. <HI>He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his sta∣tutes and ordinances unto Israel.</HI> This the Psalmist with reason places as the last and highest instance of the divine favour. We
<PB N="16" REF="009329_0025_1030ED6EAA7965D8"/>
then by a much stronger obligation are bound to praise Him for His word and will revealed to us by CHRIST JESUS, who is the <HI>substance</HI> and accomplishment of all those <HI>good things</HI> of which the Jewish Law was only a <HI>shadow.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is no instance, wherein the providence of GOD ap∣pears more conspicuous in educing good from evil, than in o∣verruling the events of War to the support and propagation of true Religion. As the <HI>moral</HI> government of the universe must be ever the main object of a divine administration; I think it certain, that the great revolutions in the history of mankind, have, either in the way of favour or punishment, been mainly subservient to maintain or extend the influence of Religion. That the events of Arms and fortunes of Empire, have been always determined by the prescience and supreme power of GOD; appears with the fullest evidence from the many prophecies of Scripture, and their historical completion: and that conquest and dominion have been the providential means of diffusing Truth and Religion over the world, may be shewn from ancient and recent facts.</P>
<P>THE victories of ALEXANDER were so swift, that he rather flew than marched: as the prophet Daniel characterizes him, <HI>he had the wings of an eagle, and he touched not the ground</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">DAN. VII. 6. VIII. 5.</NOTE>. The effect of his rapid conquest of the East, was a revolution as great in religion as in Empire.

<PB N="17" REF="009329_0026_1030ED70390F1DE0"/>
parts of Asia. And the first translation of the Scriptures, the only pandect of true religion, had great effects even on gentile man∣ners and philosophy.</P>

It was, in the stile of Daniel, <HI>'dreadful and terrible and strong ex∣ceedingly, and conquered the whole Earth</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">DAN.

<P><PB N="18" REF="009329_0027_1030ED71D0706790" MS="y"/>THE astonishing defection from the purity of the Gospel fore∣told in the Jewish and Christian prophecies, was certainly ac∣complished in the Papal dominion. It would be too large and abstruse an enquiry, to shew the exact correspondence of the inspired descriptions with the grandeur and declension of an∣tichristian Rome. I will only shew, by pointing at some illus∣trious periods of history, in how clear a manner Almighty GOD hath made the victories and conquests of favoured nations his instruments of weakening the Papal tyranny; of freeing the world from ignorance, superstition, and imposture; and of gra∣dually restoring a pure gospel, the original doctrine of JESUS CHRIST. Popery hath for a thousand years prevailed through∣out the greatest part of Europe. It was perhaps at its highth both of superstition and authority, in the beginning of the Reformation; when all Europe trembled at the thunders of the vatican, and the Popes were both warlike and politic Princes. A great part of Germany; — and England, under a King impatient of controul, — adhered to and protected the reformation: and our happy nation hath been ever since the favoured instrument of Providence, in delivering Man∣kind from a Superstition, which at once inslaves and blinds her votaries. To assert the freedom of the human mind, and open a way for still farther emancipating the nations from this grie∣vous yoke; is probably, in the views of Providence, one great object of our late conquests and the present Peace. As the Christian world is at present divided into two great Societies, Popery and Protestantism: it is certain that all the successes of the war have terminated in favour of the latter against the
<PB N="19" REF="009329_0028_1030ED7857B49698"/>
former: in weakening the power and extent of Superstition, in advancing the sacred interests of Truth and Freedom.</P>
<P>MAY we not then conclude that the purpose of the Deity, in giving empire to the English nation, is to maintain and dif∣fuse among Mankind the blessings of humanity, freedom, and religion? In adapting human means to effect his counsels, may it not be probable; that our Nation is now raised to this highth of greatness and dominion, to be the refuge and asylum of Truth and Liberty: by its influence and example to free the western world from Error and Superstition; and to fix on this extensive Continent, what will be its <HI>peculiar</HI> glory, the universal establishment of Civil Freedom and true Religion?</P>
<P>CHRISTIANITY indeed disclaims all methods of extending it∣self, but those of Truth and Persuasion: and it may be ob∣jected, that it is not for the honour of Religion, that it should be promoted by arms and conquest. To vindicate this argu∣ment, it must be a firm principle, that a war entered into expresly with the design of forcing the consciences of men, and obliging them to adopt the religion of the conqueror, is the highest in∣justice and impiety. The distinction between the wars which promote Truth, and those which render Superstition and Im∣posture triumphant, consists in this. The wars which in their event promote true Religion are merely <HI>political</HI>; but in the ex∣tending of imposture and fals<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Religion by force of arms—as in
<PB N="20" REF="009329_0029_1030ED7C667A99E8" MS="y"/>
the case of Mahomet, and the popish crusades—those wars were expresly <HI>religious</HI>; undertaken to promote, not civil interests, but false opinions: which can never be obtruded on mankind otherwise than by violence and usurped authority. Apply this distinction to the late War: the issue of which in the present Peace hath been so favourable to the cause of Truth. The War, now so happily terminated, was in itself merely a political and commercial quarrel between rival nations. Religion was not the <HI>human</HI> object in the conquests that have promoted it: and it may be doubted whether as to military measures, it has at all influenced the deliberations of the cabinet of any Prince in Europe. Yet the events of a War conducted only on political views, have been so overruled by a propitious Providence, as to effect the great ends of GOD's moral government: the cor∣rection of vice, by the calamities it hath brought upon the world; the preservation and enlargement of Religion, by giving victory and dominion to the just cause. The past War hath cer∣tainly awakened our mother-Country from that slumber of Honour Courage and Probity, into which a profligate system of politics, and an overgrown commerce had gradually thrown her: thus it hath served to punish our enormities, and retrieve our expiring virtue. Here then we must discern and adore that Providence, which draws from human affairs, effects and consequences least in the intention of its instruments and agents: which from the political and commercial contests of rival princes, accomplishes every moral purpose of a divine administration: checks and and chastises the crimes of mankind: gives victory and conquest to
<PB N="21" REF="009329_0030_1030ED830E854CE8"/>
the juster cause: and by War itself enlarges the empire of the PRINCE OF PEACE:</P>
<P>HOWEVER flattering may be our ideas of the national glory and greatness: the <HI>Felicity</HI> of our Country so much transcends its <HI>Virtue,</HI> that we must refer it to some other cause; and what so probable, as that which is here assigned? that we are made the happy instruments of accomplishing the views and purposes of divine Providence, on account of the Freedom of our civil Government, the purity and excellence of our Religion? Civil, like intellectual Liberty is better felt than explained: we enjoy it in fact; and England and her Colonies, by being so fair examples of both Civil and Religious Freedom, will natural∣ly be a check to foreign despotism; and we may hope, always a safe retreat, a sacred asylum, from Tyranny and Persecution.</P>
<P>Thus to discern JESUS CHRIST to be the <HI>end,</HI> His GOSPEL the <HI>object</HI> of all human revolutions, affords a convincing argument (among innumerable others) both of a moral Providence and of the truth of Revealed Religion. So characteristic is that description of its divine author: <HI>a crown was given unto him, and he went forth conquering and to conquer.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">REVELAT. VI. 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>IF this theory be admitted—can there be a nobler subject of pious gratitude and thanksgiving? Empire, glory, commerce, are great objects to Kings and Statesmen: but in the counsels
<PB N="22" REF="009329_0031_1030ED849E1B2B28"/>
of GOD, they are only secondary attentions, and subservient to his universal plan of moral government; to which the interests of virtue and religion are of the first importance, as being inti∣mately connected with the happiness of his intelligent Creatures.</P>
<P>EVERY political blessing of Liberty and Empire, Peace and Security, should therefore lead us to fulfil the intentions of the Deity; and to concur with his administration, by improving them, publicly, and every one of us, to the purposes of Religion. As we have reason to think, that the successes of the War and be∣nefits of the Peace are intended for the furtherance of Truth and Christianity: let us rightly improve the inestimable pri∣vilege we ourselves enjoy, of a pure and uncorrupted Gospel. <Q><HI>GOD</HI> hath not dealt so with any Nation, neither have the heathen knowledge of his laws.</Q></P>
<P>To give a greater weight to my application of these words, and induce you to consider the <HI>bounties of Heaven</HI> as MOTIVES TO VIRTUE,—I shall apply to this purpose the reflections of a no∣ble Writer <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of CLARENDON. <HI>Contemplations</HI> on the PSALMS. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>64.</NOTE> on the passage before us. Besides the general bene∣fits of GOD's Providence, <Q>there is yet another part of his bounty, his pure natural bounty, unpurchased by any pretence or good-will of ours, which may exalt us more than all the rest that he hath ever done for us: which is, the distinction that he hath made between us that are Christians, and all the o∣ther nations of the world; by communicating his judgments,
<PB N="23" REF="009329_0032_1030ED862F9C2BE0"/>
and making known to us what he hath done for us; which he hath concealed from all the world besides. They are still left in their native ignorance, under the same blindness that co∣vered their Fathers for so many generations: to find out by the light of their Reason the dark method of their creation and the author of their being: and which they can hardly know to be worth their enquiry, by not knowing that he takes farther care of them, or expects any retribution or acknowledgment for them. —Whereas, we, by the inestimable benefit of his Scriptures, do not only know our Creator and Redeemer and all that they have done for us; but likewise what our duty is towards them, and what they can require from us. We know the conditions and mutual promises between us; and can urge and prove those promises, and demand the performance of them, if we have on our parts performed the conditions (or but honestly en∣deavoured to perform them) which were annexed to those pro∣mises. And now, if we shall wander farther from this trod∣den beaten way, than those miserable uninstructed people; who, notwithstanding the dismal darkness they are in, have approached as much nearer to it, as we have gone from it; we must expect, that GOD will keep up the distinction still, in the distribution of his favours; and draw them nearer to him, and into the right way; and suffer us to wander far∣ther out of it, and to possess that darkness, that we so wretch∣edly affect.</Q></P>

Amidst our schemes and projects, of extending the gos∣pel to the barbarous nations around us; let us be careful, that the spirit of it be not lost or neglected among its professors, by <HI>holding the truth in unrighteousness.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Cherchons la methode de convertir les infidelles.—Attachons nous d'abord au plus essentie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: a nous reformer nous memes, par un grand application a la priere, au reglement de notre interieur et de nos moeurs.

Eccles.</HI></BIBL></NOTE> The restoring of Christianity among ourselves, in principles and manners, is the great improvement we should make of the felicity of the times. Whether Peace and security, or Adversity and persecution best promote the temper and practice of Religion, is a problem that History will generally decide against us. Times of Peace and public Prosperity are too commonly Times of Vice and Irreligion. Be it our care to improve the goodness of God, as the strongest motive to Love and serve him: nor make Him those ungrateful returns of supineness and indifference in the Christian life, which are apt to accompany the external security of the Church. Since God hath done so great things for us; let it not be said, to our con∣demnation, <HI>'this people honoureth me with their lips, but their

In vain do we worship him,</HI> if our crimes and ingratitude should provoke him to change his perverted bles∣sings into correcting or avenging punishments. But I refrain from every inauspicious thought, on a subject that demands the utmost exultation of our Praise.

<P>IF then we prize our CIVIL LIBERTY: let us <HI>not use it for a cloke of</HI> licentiousness, <HI>but as the servants of</HI> GOD, <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">I PET. II. 16.</NOTE> by our con∣scientious subjection to laws and government. If we glory in our political greatness, PEACE, and security; and are apt to pride ourselves in our prosperity, as if we should never be moved; perverting our blessings by voluptuousness and luxury: let us 'make no tarrying to turn to the Lord, nor put off from day to day; lest suddenly the wrath of the Lord come forth, and in our security we be destroyed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ECCLUS.

If we value ourselves on our RELI∣GIOUS PRIVILEGES, let us not rely upon them as <HI>alone</HI> sufficient to our salvation, nor make them a subject of strife and unchari∣tableness. <HI>Trust not in lying words, saying, the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord are these:</HI> but <HI>throughly amend your ways and your doings</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">JEREM.

Let the abundant <HI>goodness of</HI> GOD, of which we have so many re∣cent instances, <HI>lead us to repentance,</HI> animate our feeble and in∣constant virtue, and raise our contemplations, from the bounties of his Providence, to his inestimable love displayed in our re∣demption by JESUS CHRIST, <HI>the author of eternal salvation to all that obey him</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">HEBR. V, 9.</NOTE>. To His mediation we are no less indebted, for all our spiritual hopes and happiness; than to the beneficent Creator and Governour of the world, for every present good. Let us then, publickly and in particular, express our continual thankfulness, by a conversation becoming the gospel of CHRIST: and as we are, in outward profession a truly Christian people; as, probably for this reason, our nation is made the greatest and most powerful of all the Christian states; let us be careful to a∣dorn the purity of our Faith by an equal sanctity of manners. So shall the effects of our heavenly Religion be answerable to its natural tendency and design; productive of 'Glory to GOD, Peace on earth, and Benevolence among men.' <HI>The work of Righteousness shall be Peace; and the effect of Righteousness, quietness and assurance for ever</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">LUKE II. 14.

<P>Now unto the blessed and only potentate, who poureth his be∣nefits upon us, who maketh wars to cease in all the world, and giveth his people <HI>the blessing of Peace:</HI> to Him be rendered the thankful tribute of our Praise, through JESUS CHRIST, our blessed Redeemer: to whom, with the FATHER, and the ETERNAL SPIRIT, be ascribed all Glory in Earth and Heaven.
