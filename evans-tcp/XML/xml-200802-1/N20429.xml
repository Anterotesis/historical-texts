<HEAD>THE CONSPIRACY OF KINGS.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY JOEL BARLOW, ESQUIRE.</BYLINE>
<OPENER>SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1792.</OPENER>
<LG>
<L>ETERNAL Truth, thy trump undaunted lend,</L>
<L>People and priests and courts and kings, attend;</L>
<L>While, borne on western gales (from that far shore</L>
<L>Where justice reigns, and tyrants tread no more)</L>
<L>Th' unwon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed voice, that no dissuasion awes,</L>
<L>That fears no frown, and seeks no blind applause,</L>
<L>Shall tell the bliss that Freedom sheds abroad,</L>
<L>The rights of nature and the gift of God.</L>
<L>Think not, ye knaves, whom meanness stiles the Great,</L>
<L>Drones of the Church, and harpies of the State,—</L>
<L>Ye, whose curst sires, for blood and plunder fam'd,</L>
<L>Sultans or kings or czars or emp'rots nam'd,</L>
<L>Taught the deluded world their claims to own,</L>
<L>And raise the crested reptiles to a throne,—</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="026795_0005_0FD1CC1BF74E4F58"/>
Ye who pretend to your dark best was given</L>
<L>The lamp of life, the mystic keys of heaven:</L>
<L>Whose impious arts, with magic spells, began</L>
<L>When shades of ign'rance veil'd the race of man;</L>
<L>Who change, from age to age, the fly deceit,</L>
<L>As Science beams, and Virtue learns the cheat;</L>
<L>Tyrants of double powers, the soul that blind,</L>
<L>To rob, to scourge, and brutalize mankind,—</L>
<L>Think not I come to croak, with omen'd yell,</L>
<L>The dire damnations of your future hell;</L>
<L>To bend a bigot or reform a knave,</L>
<L>By op'ning all the scenes beyond the grave.</L>
<L>I know your crested souls: while one defies,</L>
<L>In sceptic scorn, the vengeance of the skies,</L>
<L>The other boasts,—"I ken thee, Power divine,</L>
<L>"But fear thee not; th' avenging bolt is mine."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No! 'tis the present world that prompts the song;</L>
<L>The world we see; the world that feels the wrong,</L>
<L>The world of men, whose arguments ye know,</L>
<L>Of men, long curb'd to servitude and woe;</L>
<L>Men, rous'd from sloth, by indignation slung,</L>
<L>Their strong hands loos'd, and found their fearless tongue;</L>
<L>Whose voice of fire, whose deep-descending steel,</L>
<L>Shall speak to souls, and teach dull nerves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o feel.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Think not—(al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>no! the weak delusion shun;</L>
<L>Burke leads you wrong, the world is not his own)</L>
<L>Indulge not once the thought, the vapory dream,</L>
<L>The fool's repast, the madman's thread-bare theme,</L>
<L>That nations, rising in the light of truth,</L>
<L>Strong with new life and pure regen'rate youth,</L>
<L>Will shrink from tolls so splendidly begun,</L>
<L>Their bliss abandon and their glory shun;</L>
<L>Betray the trust by Heaven's own hand consign'd,</L>
<L>The great concentred stake, the interest of man∣kind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye speak of kings combin'd, some league that draws</L>
<L>Europe's whole force, to save your sinking cause;</L>
<L>Of fancy'd hosts by myriads that advance,</L>
<L>To crush the untry'd pow'r of new-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orn France.</L>

Misguided men! these idle tales despise;</L>
<L>Let one bright ray of reason strike your eyes;</L>
<L>Show me your kings, the sceptred horde parade,—</L>
<L>See their pomp vanish! see your visions fade!</L>
<L>Indignant man resumes the shaft he gave,</L>
<L>Disarms the tyrant, and unbinds the slave,</L>
<L>Displays the unclad skeletons of kings,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Ossa vides regum vacuis exhausta medullis.</P>

<L>Spectres of power, and serpents without stings.</L>
<L>And shall mankind, shall France, whose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> might</L>
<L>Rent the dark veil, and dragg'd them forth to light,</L>
<L>Heed now their threats in dying anguish tost?</L>
<L>And She who fell'd the monster, fear the ghost?</L>
<L>Bid young Alcides, in his grasp who takes,</L>
<L>And gripes with naked hand the twisting snakes,</L>
<L>Their force exhausted, bid him prostrate fall,</L>
<L>And dread their shadows trembling on the wall.</L>
<L>But grant to kings and courts their ancient play,</L>
<L>Recal their splendour and revive their sway;</L>
<L>Can all your cant and all your cries persuade</L>
<L>One power to join you, in your wild crusade?</L>
<L>In vain ye search to earth's remotest end;</L>
<L>No court can aid you, and no king defend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not the mad knave that S—sceptre stole,</L>
<L>Nor she, whose thunder shakes the northern pole;</L>
<L>For Frederick's widow'd sword, that scorns to tell</L>
<L>On whose weak brow his crown reluctant fell:</L>
<L>Not the tri-sceptred Prince, of Austrian mould,</L>
<L>The ape of wisdom and the slave of gold,</L>
<L>Theresa's son, who, with a feeble grace,</L>
<L>Just mimics all the vices of his race;</L>
<L>For him no charm can foreign strife afford,</L>
<L>Too mean to spend his wealth, too wise to trust his sword.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Peep o'er the Pyrenees,—but you'll disdain</L>
<L>To break the dream that sooths the monk of Spain.</L>
<L>He counts his beads, and spends his holy zeal</L>
<L>To raise once more th' inquisitorial wheel,</L>

<L>Ye ask g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t Pitt to join your desp'rate work,—</L>
<L>See how his annual aid confounds the Turk!</L>
<L>Like a war-elephant his bulk he shows,</L>
<L>And treads down friends, when frighten'd by his foes.</L>
<L>Where then, forsaken villains, will ye turn?</L>

He then returned, covered with glory, by the way of Madrid; and arrived at Versailles, amidst the caresses of the court and the applauses of all Europe.

Oh Burke, degen'rate slave! with grief and shame,</L>
<L>The muse indignant must repeat thy name.</L>
<L>Strange man, declare,—since, at creation's birth,</L>
<L>From crumbling chaos sprang this heav'n and earth,</L>
<L>Since wrecks and outcast relics still remain,</L>
<L>Whirl'd ceaseless round confusion's dreary reign,</L>
<L>Declare, from all these fragments, whence you stole</L>
<L>That genius wild, that monstrous mass of soul;</L>
<L>Where spreads the widest waste of all extremes,</L>
<L>Fell darkness frowns, and heav'n's own splendour beams;</L>
<L>Truth, Error, Falsehood, Rhetoric's raging tide,</L>
<L>And Pomp and Meanness, Prejudice and Pride,</L>
<L>Strain to an endless clang thy voice of fire,</L>
<L>Thy thoughts bewilder and thy audience tire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Like Phoebus' son, we see thee wing thy way,</L>
<L>Snatch the loose reins and mount the ear of day;</L>
<L>To earth now plunging plough thy wasting course,</L>
<L>The great sublime of weakness and of force.</L>
<L>But while the world's keen eye, with gen'rous glance,</L>
<L>Thy faults could pardon and thy worth enhance,</L>
<L>When foes were hush'd, when justice dar'd com∣mend,</L>
<L>And e'en fond Freedom claim'd thee as a friend,</L>
<L>Why in a gulph of baseness sink forlorn,</L>
<L>And change pure praise for infamy and scorn?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And didst thou hope, by thy infuriate quill,</L>
<L>To rouse mankind the blood of realms to spill?</L>

Then to restore, on death—devoted plains,</L>
<L>Their scourge to tyrants, and to man his chains?</L>
<L>To swell their souls with thy own bigot rage,</L>
<L>And blot the glories of so bright an age?</L>
<L>First stretch thy arm, and, with less impious might,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ipe out the stars, and quench the solar light:</L>

<L>Of the last garb of decency or sense,</L>
<L>Left thee its own foul horrors to display,</L>

<L>Ere seas of dark oblivion whelm thy head,</L>
<L>Reflect, lost man—If those, thy kindred knaves,</L>
<L>O'er the broad Rhine, whose flag rebellious waves,</L>
<L>Once draw the sword; its burning point shall bring</L>
<L>To thy quick nerves a never-ending sting:</L>
<L>The blood they shed thy weight of woe shall swell,</L>
<L>And their grim ghosts for ever with thee dwell.</L>

Millions, whose ceaseless toils the pomp sustain,</L>
<L>Whose hour of stupid joy repays an age of pain.</L>

<L>Of these no more. From orders, slaves and kings,</L>
<L>To thee, O Man! my heart rebounding springs:</L>

<L>From shade to light, from grief to glory rise.</L>
<L>Freedom at last, with Reason in her train,</L>

<L>See Gallia's sons, so late the tyrant's sport,</L>
<L>Machines in war and sycophants at court,</L>

<LG>
<L>LET ardent heroes seek renown in arms,</L>
<L>Pant after fame and rush to war's alarms;</L>
<L>To shining palaces let fools resort,</L>
<L>And dunces cringe, to be esteem'd at court:</L>
<L>Mine be the pleasures of a rural life,</L>
<L>From noise remote, and ignorant of strife;</L>
<L>Far from the painted belle, and white-glov'd beau,</L>
<L>The lawless masquerade, and midnight show:</L>
<L>From ladies, lap-dogs, courtiers, garters, stars,</L>
<L>Fops, fidlers, tyrants, emperors, and czars.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Full in the centre of some shady grove,</L>
<L>By nature form'd for solitude and love:</L>
<L>On banks array'd with ever-blooming flowers,</L>
<L>Near beauteous landscapes or by roseate bowers,</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="026795_0020_0FD1CC484B566B88"/>
My neat, but simple mansion I would raise,</L>
<L>Unlike the sumptuous domes of modern days;</L>
<L>Devoid of pomp, with rural plainness form'd,</L>
<L>With savage game, and glossy shells adorn'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No costly furniture should grace my hall;</L>
<L>But curling vines ascend against the wall,</L>
<L>Whose pliant branches should luxuriant twine,</L>
<L>While purple clusters swell'd with future wine;</L>
<L>To slake my thirst a liquid lapse distil</L>
<L>From craggy rocks, and spread a limpid rill.</L>
<L>Along my mansion, spiry firs should grow,</L>
<L>And gloomy yews extend the shady row:</L>
<L>The cedars flourish, and the poplars rise,</L>
<L>Sublimely tall, and shoot into the skies:</L>
<L>Among the leaves, refreshing zephyrs play,</L>
<L>And cro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ding trees exclude the noon-tide ray;</L>
<L>Whereon the birds their downy nests should form,</L>
<L>Securely shelter'd from the battering storm;</L>
<L>And to melodious notes their choir apply,</L>
<L>Soon as Aurora blush'd along the sky:</L>
<L>While all around th' enchanting music rings,</L>
<L>And ev'ry vocal grove responsive sings.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Me to sequester'd scenes, ye muses, guide,</L>
<L>Where nature wantons in her virgin pride;</L>
<L>To mossy banks, edg'd round with op'ning flowers,</L>
<L>Elysian fields and amaranthine bowers,</L>
<L>To ambrosial founts, and sleep—inspiring rills,</L>
<L>To herbag'd vales, gay lawns, and sunny hills.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Welcome, ye shades! all hail, ye vernal blooms!</L>
<L>Ye bow'ry thickets, and prophetic glooms!</L>
<L>Ye forests, hail! ye solitary woods!</L>
<L>Love-whispering groves, and silver-streaming floods!</L>
<L>Ye meads, that aromatic sweets exhale!</L>
<L>Ye birds, and all ye sylvan beauties, hail!</L>
<L>Oh how I long with you to spend my days,</L>
<L>Invoke the muse, and try the rural lays!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No trumpets there with martial clangour sound,</L>
<L>No prostrate heroes strew the crimson ground;</L>
<L>No groves of lances glitter in the air,</L>

<L>Smile in the field, and brighten ev'ry grove:</L>

<L>Gay, rosy-bosom'd Spring, and April show'rs:</L>
<L>Wake, from the womb of earth, the rising flow'rs:</L>
<L>In deeper verdure, Summer clothes the plain,</L>
<L>And Autumn bends beneath the golden grain;</L>
<L>The trees weep amber; and the whispering gales</L>
<L>Breeze o'er the lawn, or murmur through the vales:</L>
<L>The flow'ry tribes in gay confusion bloom,</L>
<L>Profuse with sweets, and fragrant with perfume;</L>
<L>On blossoms blossoms, fruits on fruits arise,</L>
<L>And varied prospects glad the wand'ring eyes.</L>
<L>In these fair seats, I'd pass the joyous day,</L>
<L>Where meadows flourish, and where fields look gay,</L>
<L>From bliss to bliss with endless pleasure rove,</L>
<L>Seek crystal streams, or haunt the vernal grove,</L>
<L>Woods, fountains, lakes, the fertile fields, or shades,</L>
<L>Aërial mountains, or subjacent glades.</L>
<L>There from the polish'd fetters of the great,</L>
<L>Triumphal piles, and gilded rooms of state—</L>
<L>Prime ministers, and sycophantic knaves,</L>
<L>Illustrious villains, and illustrious slaves,</L>
<L>From all the vain formality of fools,</L>
<L>And odious task of arbitrary rules;</L>
<L>The ruffling cares, which the vex'd soul annoy,</L>
<L>The wealth the rich possess, but not enjoy,</L>
<L>The visionary bliss the world can lend,</L>
<L>Th' insidious foe, and false, designing friend,</L>
<L>The seven-fold fury of Zantippe's soul,</L>
<L>And S—'s rage, that burns without controul;</L>
<L>I'd live retir'd, contented, and serene,</L>
<L>Forgot, unknown, unenvied, and unseen.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet not a real hermitage I'd choose,</L>
<L>Nor wish to live from all the world recluse;</L>
<L>But with a friend sometimes unbend the soul,</L>
<L>In social converse, o'er the sprightly bowl.</L>
<L>With cheerful W—, serene and wisely gay,</L>

<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>THE ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ADDRESS—the folly and danger of dissention—the Orator enumerates the enemies of the fraternity—reminds them of a late unseasonable interruption—a night scene in the Potter's Field—he laments the want of true zeal in the brotherhood—and boasts of his own—the force of a ruling passion—the earth considered as a great animal—the passion of love not the same in a true son of Esoulapius as in other m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n—his own amour—a picture of his mistress in high taste—shews his learning in the description of her mouth, arm and hand—his mistress dies—his grief—and extraordinary consolation—his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fidelity—he apologizes for giving this history of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>—the great difficulties <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have to encounter in the present times, arising from false de∣licacy.

prejudice and ignorance—a strong instance in proof that it was not so formerly—curious argu∣ment to prove the inconsistency of the present opi∣nions respecting the practice—he mentions many ob∣stacles in the road to science—and reproaches them for their intestine broils, at a time when not only po∣pular clamour is loud, but even the powers of go∣vernment are exerted against them—he then encou∣rages his brethren with hopes of better times, found∣ed on the establishment of the College of Physicians—is inspired with the idea of the future glory of that institution—and prophesies great things.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L>FRIENDS and associates! lend a patient ear,</L>
<L>Suspend intestine broils and reason hear.</L>
<L>Ye followers of F—your wrath forbear—</L>
<L>Ye sons of S—your invectives spare;</L>
<L>The fierce dissention your high minds pursue</L>

<L>Some epidemic <HI>rabies</HI> turns your brains—</L>
<L>Is this a time for brethren to engage</L>
<L>In public contest and in party rage?</L>
<L>Fell discord triumphs in your doubtful strife</L>

<L>Prepar'd to cut our precious limbs away</L>
<L>And leave the bleeding body to decay—</L>

<L>In ev'ry street, see num'rous foes abound!</L>
<L>Methinks I hear them cry, in varied tones,</L>
<L>"Gives us our father's,—brother's,—sister's bones."</L>
<L>Methinks I see a mob of sailor's rise—</L>
<L>Revenge!—Revenge! they cry—and dawn their eyes—</L>
<L>Revenge for comrade Jack, whose flesh, they say,</L>
<L>Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> mine'd to morsels and then threw away.</L>

Fiercely on you their angry looks are bent,</L>
<L>They grin and gibber dangerous discontent,</L>
<L>And seem to say,—"Is there net meat enough</L>
<L>"Ah! massa cannibal, why eat poor CUFF?"</L>
<L>Ev'n hostile watchmen stand in strong array,</L>
<L>And o'er our heads their threat'ning staves display,</L>
<L>Howl hideous discord thro' the noon of night,</L>
<L>And shake their dreadful lanthorns in our sight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Say, are not these sufficient to engage</L>
<L>Your high wrought souls eternal war to wage?</L>
<L>Combine your strength these monsters to subdue</L>
<L>No friends of science and sworn foes to you;</L>
<L>On these,—on these your wordy vengeance pour,</L>
<L>And strive our fading glory to restore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah! think how, late, our mutilated rites</L>
<L>And midnight orgies, were by sudden frights</L>
<L>And loud alarms profan'd—the sacrifice,</L>
<L>Stretch'd on a board before our eager eyes,</L>
<L>All naked lay—ev'n when our chieftain stood</L>
<L>Like a high priest, prepar'd for shedding blood;</L>
<L>Prepar'd, with wondrous skill, to cut or slash</L>
<L>The gentle sliver or the deep drawn gash;</L>
<L>Prepar'd to plunge ev'n elbow deep in gore</L>
<L>Nature and nature's secrets to explore—</L>
<L>Then a tumultuous cry—a sudden fear—</L>
<L>Proclaim'd the foe—the enraged foe is near—</L>
<L>In some dark hole the hard got corse was laid,</L>
<L>And we, in wild confusion, fled dismay'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Think how, like brethren, we have shar'd the toil,</L>
<L>When in the Potter's Field<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Negro burial ground.</NOTE> we sought for spoil:</L>
<L>Did midnight ghosts, and death, and horror, brave,</L>
<L>To delve for science in the dreary grave.</L>
<L>Shall I remind you of that awful night</L>
<L>When our compacted band maintain'd the fight</L>
<L>Against an armed host?—fierce was the fray,</L>
<L>And yet we bore our sheeted prize away,</L>
<L>Firm on a horse's back the corse was laid,</L>
<L>High blowing winds the winding sheet display'd;</L>
<L><PB N="37" REF="026795_0040_0FD1CC84F77FE6A8"/>
Swift flew the steed—but still his burden bore—</L>
<L>Fear made him fleet, who ne'er was fleet before;</L>
<L>O'er tombs and sunken graves he cours'd around,</L>
<L>Nor ought respected consecrated ground.</L>
<L>Mean time the battle rag'd—so loud the strife,</L>
<L>The dead were almost frighten'd into life;</L>
<L>Tho' not victorious, yet we scorn'd to yield,</L>
<L>Retook our prize, and left the doubtful field.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In this degen'rate age, alas! how few</L>
<L>The paths of science with true zeal pursue?</L>
<L>Some trifling contest, some delusive joy,</L>
<L>Too oft the unsteady minds of youth employ.</L>
<L>For me—whom ESCULAPIUS hath inspir'd—</L>
<L>I boast a soul with love of science flr'd;</L>
<L>By one great object is my heart possest;</L>
<L>One ruling passion quite absorbs the rest;</L>
<L>In this bright point my hopes and fears unite,</L>
<L>And one pursuit alone can give delight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To me things are not as to vulgar eyes,</L>
<L>I would all nature's works anatomize:</L>
<L>This world a living monster seems to me,</L>
<L>Rolling and sporting in the aërial sea;</L>
<L>The soil encompasses her rocks and stones,</L>
<L>As flesh in animals encircles bones.</L>
<L>I see vast ocean, like a heart in play,</L>
<L>Pant <HI>systole</HI> and <HI>diastole</HI> ev'ry day,</L>
<L>And by unnumber'd <HI>venus</HI> streams supply'd</L>
<L>Up her broad rivers force the <HI>arterial</HI> tide.</L>
<L>The world's great lungs, monsoons and trade winds shew</L>
<L>From east to west, from west to east they blow</L>
<L>Alternate respiration—</L>
<L>The hills are pimples which earth's face defile,</L>
<L>And burning <HI>AEtna,</HI> an eruptive boil:</L>
<L>On her high mountains <HI>hairy</HI> forests grow,</L>
<L>And <HI>downy</HI> grass o'erspreads the vales below;</L>
<L>From her vast body perspirations rise,</L>
<L>Condense in clouds and float beneath the skies.</L>
<L>Thus fancy, faithful servant of the heart,</L>
<L>Tranforms all nature by her magic art.</L>

<L>Ev'n mighty LOVE, whose power all power con∣trouls,</L>
<L>Is not, in me, like love in other souls;</L>
<L>Yet I have lov'd—and CUPID'S subtle dart</L>
<L>Hath thro' my <HI>pericardium</HI> pierc'd my heart.</L>
<L>Brown CADAVERA did my soul ensnare,</L>
<L>Was all my thought by night and daily care;</L>
<L>I long'd to clasp, in her transcendant charms,</L>
<L>A living skeleton within my arms.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Long, lank and lean, my CADAVERA stood,</L>
<L>Like the tall pine, the glory of the wood;</L>
<L>Ofttimes I gaz'd, with learned skill to trace</L>
<L>The sharp edg'd beauties of her bony face:</L>
<L>There rose <HI>Os frontis</HI> prominent and bold,</L>
<L>In deep sunk <HI>orbits</HI> two large eye-balls roll'd,</L>
<L>Beneath those eye-balls, two arch'd bones were seen</L>
<L>Whereon two flabby cheeks hung loose and lean;</L>
<L>Between those cheeks, protuberant arose,</L>
<L>In form triangular, her lovely nose:</L>
<L>Like EGYPT'S pyramids, it seem'd to rise,</L>
<L>Scorn earth, and bid defiance to the skies;</L>
<L>Thin were her lips, and of a fallow hue,</L>
<L>Her open mouth expos'd her teeth to view;</L>
<L>Projecting strong, protuberant and wide</L>
<L>Stood <HI>incis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>res</HI>—and on either side</L>
<L>The <HI>canine</HI> rang'd, with many a beauteous flaw,</L>
<L>And last the <HI>grinders,</HI> to fill up the jaw;</L>
<L>All in their <HI>alveoli</HI> fix'd secure,</L>
<L>Articulated by <HI>gomphosis</HI> sure.</L>
<L>Around her mouth perpetual smiles had made</L>
<L>Wrinkles wherein the loves and graces play'd;</L>
<L>There, stretch'd and rigid by continual strain,</L>
<L>Appear'd the <HI>zygomatic</HI> muscles plain,</L>
<L>And broad <HI>montanus</HI> o'er her peeked chin</L>
<L>Extended to support the heavenly grin.</L>
<L>In amorous dalliance oft I stroak'd her arm.</L>
<L>Each rising muscle was a rising charm.</L>
<L>O'er the <HI>flex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>res</HI> my fond fingers play'd,</L>
<L>I found instruction with delight convey'd;</L>
<L>There <HI>carpus, orbitus,</HI> and <HI>radius</HI> too,</L>
<L>Were plainly felt and manifest to view.</L>
<L><PB N="39" REF="026795_0042_0FD1CC87F4ADA050"/>
No muscles on her lovely hand were seen,</L>
<L>But only bones envelop'd by a skin.</L>
<L>Long were her fingers and her knuckles bare,</L>
<L>Much like the claw—foot of a walnut chair.</L>
<L>So plain was complex <HI>matacarpus</HI> shewn,</L>
<L>It might be fairly counted bone by bone.</L>
<L>Her slender <HI>phalanxes</HI> were well defin'd,</L>
<L>And each with each by <HI>ginglymus</HI> combin'd.</L>
<L>Such were the charms that did my fancy fire,</L>
<L>And love—chaste scientific love inspire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length my CADAVERA fell beneath</L>
<L>The fatal stroke of all subduing death:</L>
<L>Three days in grief—three nights in tears I spent,</L>
<L>And sighs incessant gave my sorrows vent.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Few are the examples of a love so true—</L>
<L>Ev'n from her death I consolation drew,</L>
<L>And in a secret hour approach'd her grave,</L>
<L>Resolv'd her precious corse from worms to save:</L>
<L>With active haste remov'd the incumbent clay,</L>
<L>Seiz'd the rich prize and bore my love away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Her naked charms now lay before my sight,</L>
<L>I gaz'd with rapture and supreme delight,</L>
<L>Nor could fobrear, in ecstasy, to cry—</L>
<L>Beneath that shrivell'd skin what treasures lie!</L>
<L>Then feasted to the full my amorous soul,</L>
<L>And skinn'd, and cut, and slash'd without controul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas then I saw, what long I'd wish'd to see,</L>
<L>That heart which panted oft for love and me—</L>
<L>In detail view'd the form I once ador'd,</L>
<L>And nature's hidden mysteries explor'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Alas! too truly did the wise man say</L>
<L>That flesh is grass, and subject to decay:</L>
<L>Not so the bones; of substance firm and hard,</L>
<L>Long they remain the Anatomist's reward.</L>
<L>Wise nature in her providential care,</L>
<L>Did, kindly, bones from vile corruption spare,</L>
<L>That sons their fathers' skeletons might have,</L>
<L>And heaven born science triumph o'er the grave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My true love's bones I boil'd—from fat and lean</L>
<L>These hands industrious scrap'd them fair and clean,</L>
<L><PB N="40" REF="026795_0043_0FD1CC8E0DBDC2E0"/>
And ev'ry bone did to its place restore,</L>
<L>As Nature's hand had plac'd them long before;</L>
<L>These fingers twisted ev'ry pliant wire</L>
<L>With patient skill, urg'd on by strong desire.</L>
<L>Now what remains of CADAVERA'S mine,</L>
<L>Securely hanging in a case of pine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ofttimes I sit and contemplate her charms,</L>
<L>Her nodding skull and her long dangling arms,</L>
<L>Till quite inflam'd with passion for the dead,</L>
<L>I take her beauteous skeleton to bed;</L>
<L>There stretch'd, at length, close to my faithful side</L>
<L>She lies all night,—a lovely, grinning bride.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Excuse, my friends, this detail of my love,</L>
<L>You must the intent, if not the tale, approve:</L>
<L>By facts exemplary I meant to shew</L>
<L>To what extent a genuine zeal will go.</L>
<L>A mind, so fix'd, will not be drawn aside</L>
<L>By vain dissentions or a partial pride;</L>
<L>But ev'ry hostile sentiment subdue,</L>
<L>And keep the ruling passion still in view.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>False-delicacy—prejudices strong,</L>
<L>Which no distinctions know' twixt right and wrong,</L>
<L>Against our noble science spend their rage,</L>
<L>And mark the ig'norance of this vulgar age.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Time was, when living men their flesh would spare,</L>
<L>And to the knife their quiv'ring <HI>nates</HI> bare,</L>
<L>That skilful surgeons<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">TALIACOTIUS.</NOTE> noses might obtain</L>
<L>For noses lost—and cut and come again;—</L>
<L>But now the <HI>living</HI> churlishly refuse</L>
<L>To give their dead relations to our use;</L>
<L>Talk of decorum—and a thousand whims—</L>
<L>Whene'er we hack their wives' or daughter's limbs:</L>
<L>And yet their tables daily they supply</L>
<L>With the rich fruits of sad mortality;</L>
<L>Will pick, and gut, and cook a chicken's corse,</L>
<L>Dissect and eat it up without remorse;</L>
<L>Devouring fish, flesh, fowl, whatever comes,</L>
<L>Nor fear the ghosts of murder'd hecatombs.</L>

<PB N="41" REF="026795_0044_0FD1CC8F837B72F0"/>
<L>Now where's the difference?—to the impartial eye</L>
<L>A leg of mutton and a human high</L>
<L>Are just the same: for surely all must own</L>
<L>Flesh is but flesh, and bone is only bone;</L>
<L>And tho' indeed, some flesh and bone may grow</L>
<L>To make a monkey—some to make a beau,</L>
<L>Still the materials are the same, we know.</L>
<L>Nor can our anatomic knowledge trace</L>
<L>Internal marks distinctive of our race.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whence, then, these loud complaints—these hosts of foes</L>
<L>Combin'd, our useful labours to oppose?</L>
<L>How long shall foolish prejudices reign?</L>
<L>And when shall reason her just empire gain?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah! full of danger is the up hill road,</L>
<L>That leads the youth to learning's high abode:</L>
<L>His way thick mists of vulgar errors blind,</L>
<L>And sneering satire follows close behind;</L>
<L>Sour envy strews the rugged path with thorns,</L>
<L>And lazy ignorance his labour scorns.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Is this a time, ye brethren of the knife,</L>
<L>For civil contest and internal strife?</L>
<L>When loud against us gen'ral clamours cry,</L>
<L>And persecution lifts her lash on high?</L>
<L>When government—that many headed beast—</L>
<L>Against our practice rears her horrid crest,</L>
<L>And, our noctural access to oppose,</L>

<L>Yet in this night of darkness storms and fears,</L>
<L>Behold one bright benignant star<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The Medical College.</NOTE> appears—</L>
<L>Long may it shine, and, ere it's course is run,</L>

See life and health submit to his control,</L>
<L>And like a planet, <HI>death</HI> around him roll.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Methinks I see a stately fabric rise,</L>
<L>Rear'd on the skulls of these our enemies;</L>
<L>I see the bones of our invet'rate foes</L>

<L><HI>There</HI> solemn sit the learned of the day</L>
<L>Dispensing death with uncontrolled sway,</L>
<L>And by <HI>prescription</HI> regulate with ease</L>
<L>The sudden crisis or the slow disease.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then shall physicians their millennium find,</L>

<L>Then shall the face of this vile world be chang'd,</L>
<L>And nature's healthful laws all new arrang'd—</L>

<HEAD>ADDRESS OF THE GENIUS OF COLUMBIA, TO THE MEMBERS OF THE CONTINENTAL CONVENTION.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY TIMOTHY DWIGHT, D. D.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>FROM western skies, a cloud of glory came,</L>
<L>A small, dim spot, a torch of lambent flame;</L>
<L>Ascending, widening, slow the skirts unroll'd,</L>
<L>Rainbow'd with fire, and warm'd with glowing gold.</L>
<L>There, borne by summon'd winds, in pomp sublime,</L>
<L>His look far-piercing down the vast of time,</L>
<L>Where the long, narrowing vale deserts the eye,</L>
<L>Unbosom'd dimly on the eternal sky,</L>
<L>The Genius fate. He saw, when faction spent,</L>
<L>No more with war his darling kingdom rent;</L>
<L>The stream of kindred blood forbore to flow,</L>
<L>And morn faint trembled o'er the night of woe;</L>
<L>Call'd from each sister realm, the wise and great,</L>
<L>In Penn's fair walls, an awful council sate;</L>
<L>Pois'd in their hands, Columbia's mighty sway,</L>
<L>And tottering laws, and rights, and freedom lay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He saw, when fairer than the glow of even,</L>
<L>And bright as visions of disclosing heaven,</L>
<L>Full in his face a sacred splendour shone,</L>
<L>And the west kindled with another sun.</L>
<L>"All hail, my sons,"he cried,"my voice attend,</L>
<L>Your country's genius, guardian, guide, and friend:</L>
<L>The counsels mark, that faithful friend supplies,</L>
<L>Attend, and learn the dictates of the skies.</L>
<L>Before you, lo! what scenes of glory spread,</L>
<L>The fairest, brightest, noblest, heaven has made:</L>
<L>Their home, where freedom, science, virtue, find,</L>
<L>The last recesses of oppress'd mankind.</L>
<L><PB N="44" REF="026795_0047_0FD1CC94B727D7B0"/>
The immense of empire here, amaz'd, descry,</L>
<L>Where realms are lost, and hidden oceans lie;</L>
<L>Where Persia's vast would sink in shades conceal'd,</L>
<L>And Rome's proud world diminish to a field.</L>
<L>See, from the pole, where frozen fountains rise,</L>
<L>And pour their waters under torrid skies,</L>
<L>Where Rhines and Danubes, rills and streamlets play,</L>
<L>To swell the pomp of Missisippi's sea;</L>
<L>Where a zone's breadth majestic woods extend,</L>
<L>And other Andes o'er the storms ascend;</L>
<L>Where meadows bound the morn and evening rays;</L>
<L>Where plains are kingdoms, and where lakes are seas.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See thro' all climes the unmeasur'd empire run,</L>
<L>And drink each influence from the lingering sun;</L>
<L>Pure skies unbosom'd, days serenest roll,</L>
<L>And gales of health, from Darien fan the pole.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In each bless'd clime, to crown industrious toil;</L>
<L>See every product spring from every soil:</L>
<L>Here the fur whitens in the frozen shade;</L>
<L>Here flocks unnumber'd crowd the pastur'd glade;</L>
<L>Here threatening famine double harvests scorn—</L>
<L>Europe's rich grains, and India's useful corn—</L>
<L>Virginia's fragrant pride, huge fleets convey,</L>
<L>And fields of rice float cumbrous o'er the sea:</L>
<L>While all its wealth, the world of waters yields,</L>
<L>And treasures fill the subterranean fields.</L>
<L>These goods to waft where'er expands the wind,</L>
<L>To bless and to sustain the human kind,</L>
<L>See, stretch'd immense from Cancer to the pole,</L>
<L>On either side contending oceans toll;</L>
<L>O'er this, all Europe wings her haughty sails;</L>
<L>O'er that, all India wafts on spicy gales;</L>
<L>While bays, and streams, and lakes, her realms ex∣plore,</L>
<L>And land each product at each happy door.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To fill these realms, a generous race behold,</L>
<L>Of happiest genius, and of firmest mould;</L>
<L>In thoughts, in arts, in life, in language join'd,</L>
<L>One saith, one worship, one politic mind;</L>
<L><PB N="45" REF="026795_0048_0FD1CC9A2B26BCD8"/>
Patient, serene, in toils and dangers dire,</L>
<L>Their nerves of iron, and their souls of fire:</L>
<L>Call'd from all realms, these chosen sons have join'd</L>
<L>Expansive manners, and a genial mind,</L>
<L>The liberal sentiment, the adventurous thought,</L>
<L>With greatness teeming, and with goodness fraught;</L>
<L>Chain'd to no party; by no system bound;</L>
<L>Confining merit to no speck of ground;</L>
<L>Nor Britons, Frenchmen, Germans, Swiss, or Huns,</L>
<L>Of earth the natives, and of heaven the sons;</L>
<L>Regarding, loving, all the great and good,</L>
<L>Of every rank, clime, party, sect, and blood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The swain, with bliss to Europe's climes un∣known.</L>
<L>His wife, his house, his lands, his flock, his own,</L>
<L>Treads, independent, on the subject soil,</L>
<L>Prepar'd for every danger, every toil;</L>
<L>Prepar'd to see antarctic oceans roll,</L>
<L>To circle earth, and search the lonely pole;</L>
<L>Or thro' the immense of science wind his way,</L>
<L>Or lift poetic wings beyond the day;</L>
<L>The ridgy front of death for freedom dare,</L>
<L>Or, round all regions, hush the voice of war.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Heaven from all climes this happy realm con∣ceal'd,</L>
<L>While wolves and Indians roam'd the bloody field,</L>
<L>Till human rule a soft'ning aspect wore,</L>
<L>Till war's black chariot ceas'd to roll in gore,</L>
<L>Till bigot zeal resign'd his scarlet sway,</L>
<L>And his dread thunders puff'd in smoke away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus oh how bless'd the era of her fate,</L>
<L>How bright the morning, and how long the date</L>
<L>For now each fair improvement of the mind,</L>
<L>Each nobler effort lifts the human kind;</L>
<L>Vast means of bliss mechanic arts combine;</L>
<L>All liberal arts the rugged soul refine;</L>
<L>Freedom, and right, and law, their reign assume,</L>
<L>Stern power resist, and cheer the world's sad doom;</L>
<L>On nature's ocean, science lifts her sails,</L>
<L>Finds other stars, and catches nobler gales;</L>

While dawning virtue beams from yonder sky,</L>
<L>And brighter suns arise on human joy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such scenes of bliss, ye sages, bless your eyes:</L>
<L>For men, for realms like these, your plans devise.</L>
<L>Be then your counsels, as your subject, great,</L>
<L>A world their sphere, and time's long reign their date.</L>
</LG>

<L>Each party-view, each private good, disclaim,</L>
<L>Each petty maxim, each colonial aim;</L>
<L>Let all Columbia's weal your views expand,</L>
<L>A mighty system rule a mighty land;</L>
<L>Yourselves her genuine sons let Europe own,</L>
<L>Not the small agents of a paltry town.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Learn, cautious, what to alter, where to mend;</L>
<L>See to what close projected measures tend.</L>
<L>From pressing wants the mind averting still,</L>
<L>Thinks good remotest from the present ill:</L>
<L>From feuds anarchial to oppression's throne,</L>
<L>Misguided nations hence for safety run;</L>
<L>And through the miseries of a thousand years,</L>
<L>Their fatal folly mourn in bloody tears.</L>
</LG>

<L>Ten thousand follies thro' Columbia spread;</L>
<L>Ten thousand wars her darling realms invade.</L>
<L>The private interest of each jealous state;</L>
<L>Of rule the impatience, and of law the hate.</L>
<L>But ah! from narrow springs these evils flow,</L>
<L>A few base wretches mingle general woe;</L>
<L>Still the same mind her manly race pervades;</L>
<L>Still the same virtues haunt the hallow'd shades.</L>
<L>But when the peals of war her centre shook,</L>
<L>All private aims the anxious mind forsook.</L>
<L>In danger's iron-bond her race was one,</L>
<L>Each separate good, each little view unknown.</L>
<L>Now rule, unsystem'd, drives the mind astray;</L>
<L>Now private interest points the downward way</L>
<L>Hence civil discord pours her muddy stream,</L>
<L>And fools and villains float upon the brim;</L>
<L>O'er all, the sad spectator casts his eye,</L>
<L>And wonders where the gems and minerals lie.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="47" REF="026795_0050_0FD1CC6B90CB7FE0"/>
<L>But ne'er of freedom, glory, bliss, despond:</L>
<L>Uplift your eyes those little clouds beyond;</L>

<L>Roll on fair spring to chase this wint'ry day.</L>

<L>'Tis yours to bid those days of Eden shine:</L>
<L>First, then, and last, the federal bands entwine:</L>
<L>To this your every aim and effort bend:</L>
<L>Let all your efforts here commence and end.</L>
</LG>

<L>O'er state concerns, let every state preside;</L>
<L>Its private tax controul; its justice guide;</L>
<L>Religion aid; the morals to secure;</L>
<L>And bid each private right thro' time endure.</L>
<L>Columbia's interests public sway demand,</L>
<L>Her commerce, impost, unlocated land;</L>
<L>Her war, her peace, her military power;</L>
<L>Treaties to seal with every distant shore;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To bid contending states their discord cease;</L>
<L>To send thro' all the calumet of peace;</L>

<L>And lift desponding genius into light.</L>
</LG>

<L>Be then your task to alter, aid, amend;</L>
<L>The weak to strengthen, and the rigid bend;</L>
<L>The prurient lop; what's wanted to supply;</L>
<L>And graft new scions from each friendly sky.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Slow, by degrees, politic systems rise;</L>
<L>Age still refines them, and experience tries.</L>
<L>This, this alone consolidates, improves;</L>

<L>Gives that consistence time alone can give;</L>
<L>Habituates men by law and right to live;</L>
<L>To gray-hair'd rules increasing reverence draws;</L>
<L>And wins the slave to love e'en tyrant laws.</L>
<L>But should Columbia, with distracted eyes,</L>

<L>And see, afar the oarless boat conveys</L>

<L>When future worlds disclosing on our eyes,</L>
<L>The trembling soul forsakes the kindred day:</L>

<L>Before the awful bar, the Almighty throne,</L>
<L>In dread I've stood the Eternal Judge to see,</L>

<LG>
<L>Nor earth must know the rest."—Where art thou now,</L>
<L>In youthful joys my partner and my friend;</L>
<L>Of those blest hours thy fortune gave below,</L>
<L>Of all our hopes is this the fatal end?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah what avail'd that energy of mind,</L>
<L>The heights of science, and of arts to explore,</L>
<L>That early led where genius unconfin'd,</L>
<L>Spreads her glad feast, and opes her classic store!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah what avail'd, in earthly bliss so frail,</L>

<L>Ah what avail'd,—for what could then avail?—</L>

<L>As two legg'd can, to four legg'd creatures;</L>
<L>Alike the things they love and blame,</L>
<L>Their voice, and language, much the same.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Muse this subject made her theme,</L>
<L>And told me in a morning dream.</L>
<L>Such dreams you sages may decry;</L>
<L>But Muses know they never lie.</L>
<L>Then hear, from me, in grave narration,</L>
<L>Of these strange facts, the strange occasion.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In Greece Cynethe's village lay,</L>
<L>Well known to all, who went that way,</L>
<L>For dogs of every kindred famed,</L>
<L>And from true doggish manners named.</L>
<L>One morn, a greyhound pass'd the street;</L>
<L>At once the soul-mouth'd conclave met,</L>
<L>Huddling around the stranger ran,</L>
<L>And thus their smart <HI>review</HI> began.</L>
<L>"What tramper"with a grinning sneer,</L>
<L>Bark'd out the clumsy cur,"is here?</L>
<L>No native of the town, I see;</L>
<L>Some foreign whelp of base degree.</L>
<L>I'd shew, but that the record's torn,</L>
<L>We true Welsh curs are better born.</L>
<L>His coat is smooth; but longer hair</L>
<L>Would more become a dog by far.</L>
<L>His slender ear, how strait and sloping!</L>
<L>While ours is much improved by <HI>cropping.</HI>"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Right,"cried the blood-hound,"that strait ear</L>
<L>Seems made for nothing, but to hear;</L>
<L><PB N="71" REF="026795_0074_0FD1CCDA8B1B1808"/>
'Tis long agreed, thro' all the town,</L>
<L>That handsome ears, like mine, hang down;</L>
<L>And tho' his body's gaunt, and round,</L>
<L>'Tis no true rawboned gaunt of hound.</L>
<L>How high his nose the creature carries!</L>
<L>As if on bags, and flies, his fare is;</L>
<L>I'll teach this strutting stupid log,</L>
<L>To smell's the business of a dog."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Baugh-waugh!"the shaggy spaniel cried,</L>
<L>"What wretched covering on his hide!</L>
<L>I wonder where he lives in winter;</L>
<L>His strait, sleek legs too, out of joint are:</L>
<L>I hope the vagrant will not dare</L>
<L>His fledging with my fleece compare.</L>
<L>He never plung'd in pond or river,</L>
<L>To search for wounded duck and diver;</L>
<L>By kicks would soon be set a skipping,</L>
<L>Nor take, one half so well, a whipping."</L>

<L>Was ever seen so coarse a creature?</L>
<L>I hope no lady's sad mishap</L>
<L>E'er led the booby to her lap;</L>
<L>He'd fright PRIMRILLA into fits,</L>
<L>And rob FOOLERIA of her wits;</L>
<L>A mere barbarian, Indian whelp!</L>
<L>How clownish, countryish, sounds his yelp!</L>
<L>He never tasted bread and butter,</L>
<L>Nor play'd the petty squirm and flutter;</L>
<L>Nor e'er, like me, has learn'd to satten,</L>
<L>On kisses sweet, and softest patting."</L>
</LG>

<L>"Some parson's dog, I vow,"whined puppy;</L>
<L>"His rusty coat how sun-burnt! stop ye!"</L>

<L>The wolf-dog and the mastiff were,</L>
<L>The Muse says, an exception here;</L>
<L>Superior both to such foul play,</L>
<L>They wish'd the stranger well away.</L>

"Let's seize the truant,"snarl'd another,</L>
<L>Encored by every soul-mouth'd brother.</L>
<L>"'Tis done,"bark'd all,"we'll mob the creature,</L>
<L>And sacrifice him to ill-nature."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The greyhound, who despised their breath,</L>

<L>For here, even pleasure bade her own,</L>
<L>Her ladyship was once out-done.</L>

But chief, when <HI>modest young beginners,</HI></L>
<L>'Gainst <HI>critic laws,</HI> by <HI>nature</HI> sinners,</L>
<L>Peep out in verse, and dare to run,</L>
<L>Thro' towns and villages your own,</L>

<L>Set all your growling crew agog;</L>

<L>And leave the country clear for you."</L>

<L>This said, the goddess kind caressing,</L>

<L>Each doggish mind, tho' grown no bigger,</L>
<L>Henceforth assumed the human figure,</L>

<HEAD>SKETCHES OF AMERICAN HISTORY.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY CAPTAIN PHILIP FRENEAU.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>THE American world, as our histories say,</L>
<L>Secluded from Europe long centuries lay,</L>
<L>But peopled by beings whom white men detest,</L>
<L>The sons of the Tartars that came from the west.</L>
<L>These Indians, 'tis certain, were here long before ye all,</L>
<L>And dwelt in their wigwams from time immemo∣rial;</L>
<L><PB N="81" REF="026795_0084_0FD1CCF34C7721B0"/>
In a mere state of nature, untutor'd, untaught,</L>
<L>They did as they pleas'd and they spoke as they thought:</L>
<L>No priests they had then for the cure of their souls,</L>
<L>No lawyers, recorders, nor keepers of rolls;</L>
<L>No learned physicians vile nostrums conceal'd—</L>
<L>Their druggist was nature—her shop was the field.</L>
<L>In the midst of their forests how happy and blest,</L>
<L>In the skin of a bear or a buffaloe drest!</L>
<L>No care to perplex, and no luxury seen</L>
<L>But the feast, and the song, and the dance on the green,</L>
<L>Some bow'd to the moon, and some worshipp'd the sun,</L>
<L>And the king and the captain were center'd in one;</L>
<L>In a cabin, they met, on their councils of state,</L>
<L>Where age and experience alone might debate:</L>
<L>With quibbles they never essay'd to beguile,</L>
<L>And nature had taught them the orator's stile;</L>
<L>No pomp they affected, nor quaintly refin'd</L>
<L>The nervous idea that glanc'd on the mind.</L>
<L>When hunting or battle invited to arms,</L>
<L>The women they left to take care of their farms—</L>
<L>The toils of the summer did winter repay,</L>
<L>While snug in their cabins they snor'd it away.</L>
<L>If Death came among them, his dues to demand,</L>
<L>They still had some prospect of comfort at hand—</L>
<L>The dead man they sent to the regions of bliss,</L>
<L>With his bottle and dog and his fair maids to kiss.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus happy they dwelt in a rural domain.</L>
<L>Uninstructed in commerce, unpractic'd in gain,</L>
<L>Till, taught by the loadstone to traverse the seas,</L>
<L>Columbus came over, that bold Genoese.</L>
<L>From records authentic, the date we can show,</L>
<L>One thousand four hundred ninety and two</L>
<L>Years, borne by the seasons, had vanish'd away,</L>
<L>Since the babe in the manger at Bethlehem lay.</L>
<L>What an era was this, above all that had pass'd,</L>
<L>To yield such a treasure, discover'd at last—</L>
<L>A new world, in value exceeding the old,</L>
<L>Such mountains of silver, such torrents of gold!</L>
<L><PB N="82" REF="026795_0085_0FD1CCF818DFF350"/>
Yet the schemes of Columbus, however well plann'd,</L>
<L>Were scarely sufficient to find the main land;</L>
<L>On the islands alone with the natives he spoke,</L>
<L>Except when he enter'd the great Oronoque:</L>
<L>In this he resembled old Moses, the Jew,</L>
<L>Who, roving about with his wrong-headed crew,</L>
<L>When at length the reward was no longer deny'd,</L>
<L>From the top of mount Pisgah he saw it, and dy'd.</L>
<L>These islands and worlds in the wat'ry expanse,</L>
<L>Like most mighty things, were the offspring of chance,</L>
<L>Since, steering for Asia, Columbus, they say,</L>
<L>Was astonish'd to find such a world in his way:</L>
<L>No wonder, indeed, he was smit with surprise—</L>
<L>This empire of nature was new to their eyes—</L>
<L>Cut short in their course by so splendid a scene,</L>
<L>Such a region of wonders intruding between!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet great as he was, and deserving, no doubt,</L>
<L>We have only to thank him for finding the route;</L>
<L>These climes to the northward, more stormy and cold,</L>
<L>Were reserv'd for the efforts of Cabot the bold.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where the sun in December appears to decline,</L>
<L>Far off to the southward, and south of the line,</L>
<L>A merchant of Florence,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Americus Vespucius.</NOTE> more fortunate still,</L>
<L>Explor'd a new track, and discover'd Brazil:</L>
<L>Good fortune, Vespucius, pronounc'd thee her own,</L>
<L>Or else to mankind thou hadst scarcely been known—</L>
<L>By giving thy name, thou art ever renown'd—</L>
<L>Thy name to a world that another had found!</L>
<L>Columbia the name was, that merit decreed,</L>
<L>But Fortune and Merit have never agreed—</L>
<L>Yet the poets, alone, with commendable care,</L>
<L>Are vainly attempting the wrong to repair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The bounds I prescribe to my verse are too narrow,</L>
<L>To tell of the conquests of Francis Pizarro;</L>
<L><PB N="83" REF="026795_0086_0FD1CCFC772FD2A8"/>
And Cortez 'tis needless to bring into view,</L>
<L>One Mexico conquer'd, the other Peru.</L>
<L>Montezuma with credit in verse might be read,</L>
<L>But Dryden has told you the monarch<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Indian Emperor, a tragedy.</NOTE> is dead!</L>
<L>And the woes of his subjects—what torments they bore</L>
<L>Las Casas, good bishop, has mention'd before;</L>
<L>Let others be fond of their stanzas of grief—</L>
<L>I hate to descant on the fall of the leaf—</L>
<L>Two scenes are so gloomy, I view them with pain,</L>
<L>The annals of Death, and the triumphs of Spain.</L>
<L>Poor Ata-bualpa I cannot forget—</L>
<L>He gave them his utmost, yet died in their debt,</L>
<L>His wealth was a crime, that they could not forgive,</L>
<L>And when they possess'd it—forbade him to live.</L>
<L>Foredoom'd to misfortunes (that came not alone)</L>
<L>He was the twelfth Inca that sat on the throne,</L>
<L>Who fleecing his brother<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Huascar, who was legal heir to the throne.</NOTE> of half his domains,</L>
<L>At the palace of Cusco confin'd him in chains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But what am I talking—or where do I roam?</L>
<L>'Tis time that our story was brought nearer home—</L>
<L>From Florida's cape did Cabot explore</L>
<L>To the fast frozen regions of cold Labradore.</L>
<L>In the year fourteen hundred and ninety and eight</L>
<L>He came, as the annals of England relate:</L>
<L>But finding no gold in the lengthy domain,</L>
<L>And coasting the country, he left it again.</L>
<L>Next Davis—then Hudson adventur'd, they say,</L>
<L>One found out a streight, and the other a bay,</L>
<L>Whose desolate region, or turbulent wave</L>
<L>One present bestow'd him—and that was a grave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In the reign of a virgin (whom some call'd a w—)</L>
<L>Drake, Hawkins, and Raleigh in squadrons came o'er—</L>
<L>While Barlow and Grenville succeeded to these,</L>
<L>Who all brought their colonies over the seas.</L>
<L>These, left in a wilderness teeming with woes,</L>
<L>The natives, suspicious, concluded them foes,</L>
<L><PB N="84" REF="026795_0087_0FD1CCFDDAE77F38"/>
And murder'd them all without notice or warning,</L>
<L>Ralph Lane with his vagabonds, scarcely returning.</L>
<L>In the reign of king James (and the first of the name)</L>
<L>George Summers with Hacluit to Chesapeake came,</L>
<L>Where far in the forests, not doom'd to renown,</L>
<L>On the river Powhatan<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">James river, Virginia.</NOTE> they built the first town.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">James Town.</NOTE></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Twelve years after this some scores of dissenters</L>
<L>To the northernmost district, came seeking adven∣tures;</L>
<L>Outdone by the bishops, those great faggot fighters,</L>
<L>They left them to hell with their cassocks and mitres.</L>
<L>Thus banish'd forever, and leaving the sod,</L>
<L>The first land they saw was the pitch of Cape Cod,</L>
<L>Where, famish'd with hunger, and quaking with cold,</L>
<L>They plann'd their new Plymouth—so call'd from the old.</L>
<L>They were, without doubt, a delightful collection;</L>
<L>—Some came to be rid of a Stuart's direction;</L>
<L>Some sail'd with a view to dominion and riches,</L>
<L>Some to pray without book, and a few to hang witches;</L>
<L>Some came, on the Indians to shed a new light,</L>
<L>Convinc'd, long before, that their own must be right,</L>
<L>And that all, who had died in the centuries past,</L>
<L>On the devil's lee shore were eternally cast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>These exiles were cast in a whimsical mould,</L>
<L>And were aw'd by their priests, like the Hebrews of old;</L>
<L>Disclaim'd all pretences to jesting and laughter,</L>
<L>And sigh'd their lives through to be happy here∣after.</L>
<L>On a crown immaterial their hearts were intent,</L>
<L>They look'd towards Zion, wherever they went,</L>
<L>Did all things in hope of a future reward,</L>
<L>And worry'd mankind—for the sake of the Lord.</L>
<L><PB N="85" REF="026795_0088_0FD1CCFFD4160760"/>
With rigour excessive they strengthen'd their reign,</L>
<L>Their laws were conceiv'd in the ill-natur'd strain;</L>
<L>With mystical meanings the saint was perplext,</L>
<L>And the flesh and the devil were slain by a text,</L>
<L>The body was scourg'd, for the good of the soul,</L>
<L>All folly discourag'd by peevish control,</L>
<L>A knot on the head was the sign of no grace,</L>
<L>And the pope and his comrade were pictur'd in lace.</L>
<L>A stove in their churches, or pews lin'd with green,</L>
<L>Were horrid to think of, much more to be seen.</L>
<L>Their bodies were warm'd with the linings of love,</L>
<L>And the fire was sufficient that flash'd from above.</L>
<L>'Twas a crime to assert, that the moon was opaque;</L>
<L>To say the earth mov'd, was to merit the stake;</L>
<L>And he, that could tell an eclipse was to be,</L>
<L>In the college of satan had ta'en his degree.</L>
<L>On Sundays their faces were dark as a cloud—</L>
<L>The road to the meeting was only allow'd;</L>
<L>And those they caught rambling, on bus'ness or pleasure,</L>
<L>Were sent to the stocks, to repent at their leisure.</L>
<L>This day was the mournfullest day in the week:</L>

The first that attempted to enter this streight,</L>

<L>Was Hudson (the same that we mention'd before,)</L>
<L>Who was lost in the gulph that he went to explore.</L>
<L>For a sum that they paid him (we know not how much)</L>
<L>This captain transferr'd all his right to the Dutch;</L>
<L>For the time has been here, to the world be it known,</L>
<L>When all a man sail'd by, or saw, was his own.</L>
<L>The Dutch on their purchase sat quietly down,</L>
<L>And fix'd on an island to lay out a town;</L>
<L>They modell'd their streets from the horns of a ram,</L>
<L>And the name that bost pleas'd them was New Am∣sterdam,</L>
<L>They purchas'd large tracts from the Indians for beads,</L>
<L>And sadly tormented some runaway Swedes,</L>
<L>Who, none knows for what, from their country had slown</L>
<L>To live here in peace undisturb'd and alone.</L>
<L>New Belgin, the Dutch call'd their province, be sure,</L>
<L>But names never yet made possession secure;</L>
<L>For Charly (the second that honour'd the name)</L>

<L>(Had his sword and title been equally slender,</L>
<L>In vain had they summon'd Mynheer to surrender)</L>
<L>The soil they demanded or threaten'd their worst,</L>
<L>Insisting that Cabot had look'd at it first.</L>
<L>The want of a squadron to fall on their rear,</L>
<L>Made the argument perfectly plain to Mynheer—</L>
<L>Force ended the contest—the right was a sham,</L>
<L>And the Dutch were sent packing to hot Surinam.</L>
<L>'Twas hard to be thus of their labours deprived,</L>
<L>But the age of republics had not yet arriv'd—</L>
<L>Fate saw—tho' no wizzard could tell them as much,</L>

<LG>
<L>COLUMBUS looked; and still around them spread,</L>
<L>From south to north, th' immeasurable shade;</L>
<L>At last, the central shadows burst away,</L>
<L>And rising regions open'd on the day.</L>
<L>He saw, once more, bright Del'ware's silver stream,</L>
<L>And Penn's throng'd city cast a cheerful gleam;</L>
<L>The dome of state, that met his eager eye,</L>
<L>Now heav'd its arches in a loftier sky.</L>
<L>The bursting gates unfold: and lo, within,</L>
<L>A solemn train, in conscious glory, shine.</L>
<L>The well-known forms his eye had trac'd before,</L>
<L>In diff'rent realms along th' extended shore;</L>
<L>Here, grac'd with nobler fame, and rob'd in slate,</L>
<L>They look'd and mov'd magnificently great.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>High on the foremost seat, in living light,</L>
<L>Majestic Randolph caught the hero's sight:</L>
<L>Fair on his head, the civic crown was plac'd,</L>
<L>And the first dignity his sceptre grac'd.</L>
<L>He opes the cause, and points in prospect far,</L>
<L>Thro' all the toils that wait th' impending war—</L>
<L>But, hapless sage, thy reign must soon be o'er,</L>
<L>To lend thy lustre, and to shine no more.</L>
<L>So the bright morning star, from shades of ev'n,</L>
<L>Leads up the dawn, and lights the front of heav'n,</L>
<L>Points to the waking world the sun's broad way,</L>
<L>Then veils his own, and shines above the day.</L>
<L>And see great Washington behind thee rise,</L>
<L>Thy following sun, to gild our morning skies;</L>
<L><PB N="90" REF="026795_0093_0FD1CD0F03F79448"/>
O'er shadowy climes to pour the enliv'ning flame,</L>
<L>The charms of freedom and the fire of fame.</L>
<L>Th' ascending chief adorn'd his splendid seat,</L>
<L>Like Randolph, ensign'd with a crown of state;</L>
<L>Where the green patriot bay beheld, with pride,</L>
<L>The hero's laurel springing by its side;</L>
<L>His sword, hung useless, on his graceful thigh,</L>
<L>On Britain still he cast a filial eye;</L>
<L>But sov'reign fortitude his visage bore,</L>
<L>To meet their legions on th' invaded shore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sage Franklin next arose, in awful mien,</L>
<L>And smil'd, unruffled, o'er th' approaching scene;</L>
<L>High, on his locks of age, a wreath was brac'd,</L>
<L>Palm of all arts, that e'er a mortal grac'd;</L>
<L>Beneath him lies the sceptre kings have borne,</L>
<L>And crowns and laurels from their temples torn.</L>
<L>Nash, Rutledge, Jefferson, in council great,</L>
<L>And Jay and Laurens op'd the rolls of fate.</L>
<L>The Livingstons, fair Freedom's gen'rous hand,</L>
<L>The Lees, the Houstons, fathers of the land,</L>
<L>O'er climes and kingdoms turn'd their ardent eyes,</L>
<L>Bade all th' oppress'd to speedy vengeance rise;</L>
<L>All pow'rs of state, in their extended plan,</L>
<L>Rise from consent to shield the rights of man.</L>
<L>Bold Wolcott urg'd the all-important cause;</L>
<L>With steady hand the solemn scene he draws;</L>
<L>Undaunted firmness with his wisdom join'd,</L>
<L>Nor kings nor worlds could warp his stedfast mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, graceful rising from his purple throne,</L>
<L>In radiant robes, immortal Hosmer shone;</L>
<L>Myrtles and bays his learned temples bound,</L>
<L>The statesman's wreath, the poet's garland crown'd:</L>
<L>Morals and laws expand his liberal soul,</L>
<L>Beam from his eyes, and in his accents roll.</L>
<L>But lo! an unseen hand the curtain drew,</L>
<L>And snatch'd the patriot from the hero's view;</L>
<L>Wrapp'd in the shroud of death, he sees descend</L>
<L>The guide of nations and the muse,' friend.</L>
<L>Columbus dropp'd a tear. The angel's eye</L>
<L>Trac'd the freed spirit mounting thro' the sky.</L>

<L>Adams, enrag'd, a broken charter bore,</L>
<L>And lawless acts of ministerial pow'r;</L>
<L>Some injur'd right in each loose leaf appears</L>
<L>A king in terrors and a land in tears;</L>
<L>From all the guileful plots the veil he drew,</L>
<L>With eye retortive look'd creation through;</L>
<L>Op'd the wide range of nature's boundless plan,</L>
<L>Trac'd all the steps of liberty and man;</L>
<L>Crouds rose to vengeance while his accents rung,</L>

<L>NOW, where the sheeted flames thro' Charleston roar,</L>
<L>And lashing waves hiss round the burning shore,</L>
<L>Thro' the deep folding fires, a neighbouring height</L>
<L>Thunders o'er all, and seems a field of fight.</L>
<L>Like shadowy phantoms in an evening grove,</L>
<L>To the dark strife the closing squadrons move;</L>
<L>They join, they break, they thicken thro' the air,</L>
<L>And blazing batteries burst along the war;</L>
<L>Now, wrapp'd in redd'ning smoke, now dim in sight</L>
<L>They sweep the hill, or wing the downward flight.</L>
<L>Here, wheel'd and wedg'd, whole ranks together turn,</L>
<L>And the long lightnings from their pieces burn:</L>
<L>There, scattering flashes light the scanty train,</L>
<L>And broken squadrons tread the moving plain.</L>
<L>Britons in fresh battalions rise the height,</L>
<L>And, with increasing vollies, give the fight.</L>
<L>Till, smear'd with clouds of dust and bath'd in gore,</L>
<L>As growing foes their rais'd artillery pour,</L>

Columbia's hosts move o'er the fields afar,</L>
<L>And save, by slow retreat, the sad remains of war.</L>
<L>There strides bold Putnam, and from all the plains,</L>
<L>Calls the tir'd host, the tardy rear sustains.</L>
<L>And, mid the whizzing deaths that fill the air,</L>
<L>Waves back his sword, and dares the following war.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thro' falling fires, Columbus sees remain</L>
<L>Half of each host in heaps promiscuous slain;</L>
<L>While dying crouds the ling'ring life-blood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our,</L>
<L>And slipp'ry steeds are trod with prints of gore,</L>
<L>There, hapless Warren, thy cold earth was seen,</L>
<L>There spring thy laurels in immortal green;</L>
<L>Dearest of chiefs, that ever press'd the plain,</L>
<L>In Freedom's cause, with early honours slain;</L>
<L>Still dear in death, as when in fight you mov'd,</L>
<L>By hosts applauded and by heaven approv'd,</L>
<L>The faithful muse shall tell the world thy fame,</L>
<L>And unborn realms resound th' immortal name.</L>

<L>Now, from all plains, as smoky wreaths decay,</L>
<L>Unnumber'd shapes start forward to th' affray;</L>
<L>Tall, thro' the lessening shadows, half conceal'd,</L>
<L>They glide and gather in a central field;</L>
<L>There, stretch'd immense, like length'ning groves they stand,</L>
<L>Eye the dark foe, and eager strife demand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>High in the frowning front exalted shone</L>
<L>A hero, pointing tow'rd the half-seen sun:</L>
<L>As, thro' the mist the bursting splendours glow,</L>
<L>And light the passage to the distant foe;</L>
<L>His waving steel returns the living day,</L>
<L>Clears the broad plains and marks the warrior's way;</L>
<L>The long, deep squadrons range in order bright,</L>
<L>And move impatient for the promis'd fight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When great Columbus saw the chief arise,</L>
<L>And his bold blade cast lightning on the skies,</L>
<L>He trac'd the form that met his view before,</L>

<HEAD>EULOGIUM ON RUM.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY JOSEPH SMITH.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>ARISE! ye pimpled, tipling race, arise!</L>
<L>From ev'ry town and village tavern, come!</L>
<L>Shew your red noses, and o'erflowing eyes,</L>
<L>And help your poet chant the praise of Rum.</L>
<L>The cordial drop, the morning dram, I sing,</L>
<L>The mid-day toddy, and the evening sling.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hail, mighty Rum! and by this general name</L>
<L>I call each species—whisky, gin, or brandy:</L>
<L>(The kinds are various—but the effect's the same;</L>
<L>And so I choose a name that's short and handy:</L>
<L>For reader, know, it takes a deal of time,</L>
<L>To make a crocked word lie smooth in thyme.)</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="110" REF="026795_0113_0FD1CD375CCC3140"/>
<L>Hail, mighty Rum! thy song inspiring merit</L>
<L>Is known to many a bard in these our days:</L>
<L>Apollo's drink, they find, is void of spirit—</L>
<L>Mere chicken-broth—insipid as their lays:</L>
<L>And, pleas'd, they'd give a riv'let—aye a sea</L>
<L>Of tuneful water, for one quart of thee!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hail, mighty Rum! how wond'rous is thy pow'r!</L>
<L>Unwarm'd by thee, how would our spirits fail,</L>
<L>When dark December comes, with aspect sour,</L>
<L>And, sharp as razor, blows the northern gale!</L>
<L>And yet thou'rt grateful in that sultry day,</L>
<L>When raging Sirius darts his fervid ray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hail, mighty Rum! to thee the wretched fly:</L>
<L>And find a sweet oblivion of their woes;</L>
<L>Lock'd in thy arms, as in the grave, they lie—</L>
<L>Forget their kindred—and forgive their foes.</L>
<L>And Lethe's stream, (so much extoll'd by some,</L>
<L>In ancient times) I shrewdly guess, was Rum.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hail, mighty Rum! what can thy pow'r withstand!</L>
<L>E'en lordly Reason flies thy dreadful face:</L>
<L>And Health, and Joy, and all the lovely band</L>
<L>Of social virtues, shun thy dwelling place:</L>
<L>(For in whatever breast it rears its throne,</L>
<L>Like Turkish monarchs, Rum must rule alone.)</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When our bold fathers cross'd th' Atlantic wave,</L>
<L>And here arriv'd—a weak defenceless band—</L>
<L>Pray, what became of all the tribes so brave—</L>
<L>The savage owners of this happy land?</L>
<L>Were they sent headlong to the realms below,</L>
<L>"By doom of battle?"friend,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This alludes only to Jersey, Pennsylvania, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> I answer no.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our fathers were too wise to think of war;</L>
<L>They knew the woodlands w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> quickly past,</L>

<L><PB N="111" REF="026795_0114_0FD1CD39D2B14B28"/>
But Rum, assisted by his son, Disease,</L>
<L>Perform'd the business with surprising ease.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And would our western brethren be less proud, or,</L>
<L>In other words, throw by their gun and drum—</L>
<L>For ducks and squirrels, save their lead and powder,</L>
<L>And send the tawny rogues some pipes of rum—</L>
<L>I dare predict, they all would gladly suck it;</L>
<L>And ev'ry mother's son soon <HI>kick the bucket.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But lo! th' ingratitude of Adam's race!</L>
<L>Tho' all these clever things to Rum we owe—</L>
<L>Gallons of ink are squirted in his face;</L>
<L>And his bruis'd back is bang'd with many a blow;</L>
<L>Some hounds of note have rung his funeral knell,</L>
<L>And ev'ry puppy joins the gen'ral yell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So have I seen (the simile is fine—</L>
<L>And wonderfully pat—tho' rather old)</L>
<L>When rising Phoebus shot his rays benign,</L>
<L>A flock of sheep come skipping from the fold;</L>
<L>Some restless sheep cries baa: and all the throng,</L>
<L>Ewes, rams, lambs, wethers, bellowing pour along.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But fear not, Rum, tho' fiercely they assail,</L>
<L>And none but I, the bard, thy cause defend,</L>
<L>Think not thy foes—tho' num'rous—shall prevail,</L>
<L>Thy pow'r diminish, or thy being end:</L>
<L>Tho' spurn'd from table, and the public eye,</L>
<L>In the snug closet safely shalt thou lie.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And oft, when Sol's proud chariot quits the sky,</L>
<L>And humbler Cynthia mounts her one-horse chair,</L>
<L>To that snug closet shall thy vot'ry fly;</L>
<L>And, wrapt in darkness, keep his orgies there;</L>
<L>Lift the full bottle, joyous, to his head,</L>
<L>Then, great as Caesar, reel sublime to bed.</L>

<L>Ere fades the grateful scene, indulge thine eye,</L>

<L>Proud of his vast, profound employ,</L>

<L>YE constant to truth and to love!</L>
<L>Forgive me this wand'ring of mind—</L>
<L>Ah! do not forgive, but approve,</L>
<L>And repentance I'll throw to the wind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In absence from Delia I've wept;</L>
<L>I've pin'd at the loss of my fair;</L>
<L>Had the vows pledg'd so sacred been kept,</L>
<L>My breast had ne'er swell'd with despair!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But no more I repine—for a maid,</L>
<L>The sweetest, the lov'liest e'er seen,</L>
<L>Has heal'd my heart's wounds as they bled.</L>
<L>And bade me no more to complain.</L>

</LG>

<L>What enchantment, what magic her eyes!</L>
<L>Tis rapture to see her but move:</L>
<L>When she smiles,—nor is great the surprise,—</L>
<L>E'en envy is ravish'd to love.</L>

<L>O, hasten ye sweet future hours!</L>

<L>HERE lies a fool fiat on his back,</L>
<L>The victim of a Cancer Quack;</L>
<L>Who lost his money and his life,</L>
<L>By plaster, caustic, and by knife.</L>
<L>The case was this—a pimple rose,</L>
<L>South-east a little of his nose;</L>
<L>Which daily redden'd and grew bigger,</L>
<L>As too much drinking gave it vigour:</L>
<L>A score of gossips soon ensure</L>
<L>Full three score diff'rent modes of cure:</L>
<L>But yet the full-fed pimple still</L>
<L>Defied all petticoated skill:</L>
<L>When fortune led him to peruse</L>
<L>A hand-bill in the weekly news;</L>
<L>Sign'd by six fools of diff'rent sorts,</L>
<L>All cur'd of cancers made of warts;</L>
<L>Who recommend, with due submission,</L>
<L>This cancer-monger as magician;</L>
<L>Fear wing'd his flight to find the quack,</L>
<L>And prove his cancer-curing knack:</L>
<L>But on his way he found another,—</L>

<L>But as much like him as an owl</L>

<L>And of the two the greater hog:</L>
<L>Who us'd a still more magic plaster,</L>
<L>That sweat forsooth, and cur'd the faster.</L>
<L>This doctor view'd, with moony eyes</L>
<L>And scowl'd up face, the pimple's size;</L>
<L>Then christen'd it in solemn answer,</L>

<L>Declares how long by Satan vex'd,</L>

<LG>
<L>He makes the poor his daily pray'r,</L>

<L>With patt'ring rain and snow, or driving sleet,</L>
<L>Rave idly loud, and at their window beat:</L>
<L>Safe from its rage regardless of its roar,</L>
<L>In vain the tempest rattles at the door—</L>
<L>The same brutes shelter'd and the feather'd brood</L>
<L>From them, more provident, demand their food.</L>
<L>'Tis then the time from hoarding cribs to feed</L>
<L>The ox laborious, and the noble steed:</L>
<L>'Tis then the time, to tend the bleating fold,</L>
<L>To strow with litter, and to fence from cold.</L>
<L>The cattle fed—the fuel pil'd within—</L>
<L>At setting day, the blissful hours begin:</L>
<L>'Tis then, sole owner of his little cot,</L>
<L>The farmer feels his independent lot;</L>
<L>Hears with the crackling blaze, that lights the wall,</L>
<L>The voice of gladness and of nature call,</L>
<L>Beholds his children play, their mother smile,</L>
<L>And tastes with them the fruit of summer's toil.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From stormy heav'ns, the mantling clouds un∣roll'd,</L>
<L>The sky is bright, the air serenely cold.</L>
<L>The keen north-west, that heaps the drifted snows,</L>
<L>For months entire o'er frozen regions blows:</L>
<L>Man braves his blast; his gelid breath inhales;</L>
<L>And feels more vig'rous as the frost prevails.</L>
<L>Th' obstructed path beneath the frequent tread,</L>
<L>Yields a smooth crystal to the flying steed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis then full oft, in arts of love untry'd</L>
<L>The am'rous stripling courts his future bride;</L>
<L>And oft, beneath the broad moon's paler day,</L>
<L>The village pairs ascend the rapid sleigh;</L>
<L>With jocund sounds impel th' enliven'd steed—</L>
<L>Say ye, who know their joys, the lulling speed,</L>
<L>At ev'ry bridge the tributary kiss,</L>
<L>Can courtly balls exceed their rustic bliss?</L>

So Science in the orient climes began,</L>
<L>And, like bright Sol, a western circuit ran:</L>
<L>From Egypt's schools to Greece was learning brought,</L>
<L>What Cadmus old, or Palamedes taught;</L>
<L>Her form illustrious Athens did illume,</L>
<L>And rais'd the genius of imperial Rome.</L>
<L>From Latium's plains she fought Britannia's shore,</L>
<L>And bid her barb'rous sons be rude no more.</L>
<L>Fierce nations roam'd around the rugged isle,</L>
<L>Till Science on its fields began to smile.</L>
<L>Fair Cam and Isis heard no Muse's strains,</L>
<L>Their shades were trod by wolves and fiercer Danes;</L>
<L>'Till, with the Arts, Augusta's grandeur rose,</L>
<L>And her loud thunder shook the deep's repose:</L>
<L>And such in time (if right the Muse descries)</L>
<L>Shall this wide realm with tow'ry cities rise.</L>
<L>The spacious Delaware through future song,</L>
<L>Shall roll in deathless majesty along;</L>
<L>Each grove and mountain shall be sacred made,</L>
<L>As now is Cooper's Hill and Windsor's shade.</L>
<L>Flush'd with the thought, I'm borne to ages hence,</L>
<L>The Muse-wrought vision rushes on my sense,</L>
<L>Methinks Messiah's ensign I behold</L>
<L>In the deep gloom of yonder shades inroll'd,</L>
<L>And hear the gospel's silver clarion sound,</L>
<L>Rousing with heav'nly strains the heathen round:</L>
<L>Methinks I hear the nations shout aloud,</L>
<L>And to the glory-beaming standard croud;</L>
<L>New inspiration shake each trembling frame,</L>
<L>The Paracelete pour forth the lambent flame,</L>
<L>In unremitting streams on ev'ry soul,</L>
<L>While thro' their breasts celestial transports roll.</L>
<L>Stupendous change! methinks th' effects appear.</L>
<L>In the dark region sacred temples rear</L>
<L>Their lofty heads. Fair cities strike my sight;</L>
<L>And heav'n-taught Science spreads a dazzling light,</L>
<L>O'er the rough scene where Error's court was found,</L>

<L>Whizzing, fierce the weapon whirl'd,</L>
<L>And quiver'd in the wood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Reldor then with sullen stride,</L>
<L>His knife was in his hand,</L>
<L>Advanc'd, and thus aloud he cried,—</L>
<L>And cut the twisted band.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Reldor takes thee for his son,</L>
<L>Colwall in battle stain:</L>
<L>In many a fight his fame he won,</L>
<L>Nor shrunk from death or pain.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Silent now the warrior train</L>
<L>Bear the blood-stain'd chief,—</L>
<L>No more they weep for Colwall slain,—</L>
<L>No more is known of grief.—</L>

<L>DARK is the hour and lone, o'er icy plains,</L>

<L>The clouds of death that gloom the baleful year,</L>
<L>The days of joy, alas, so lately fled!</L>
<L>While Friendship bids its sympathetic tear</L>
<L>Stream in remembrance of the much-lov'd dead.</L>

<L>The fairy hopes that raptur'd Fancy drew,</L>

<L>What notes of woe, in mournful cadence swell</L>
<L>Along the western breeze from climes afar,</L>
<L>Mix'd with the dying groan, the savage yell,</L>

<L>With torrent sweep, amid a night of woods,</L>

<L>Lo! this the scene where War, with bloody hand,</L>
<L>Wav'd his red standard o'er the carnag'd ground;</L>
<L>Where wild-eyed Horror led the tawny band,</L>

<L>His bounteous influence, thro' all nature driv'n,</L>
<L>Warms the wide earth, and cheers the wider heav'n.</L>
<L>All scenes, all beings his pure sight surveys,</L>
<L>Where morn begins, and where pale eve decays;</L>
<L>Where hell's dark shores the glooms of night dis∣play:</L>
<L>Or heav'n's broad palace glows in lasting day:</L>
<L>Thro' worlds of endless youth, where angels shine,</L>
<L>And unknown nations rove in light divine:</L>
<L>He moves, informs, directs, and rules the whole:</L>
<L>Their cause, their end, their guardian, and their soul.</L>
</LG>

<L>He wakes the beauties of the vernal morn;</L>
<L>He bids the flames of sultry summer burn:</L>

<L>In these vast regions countless beings move,</L>

With boundless view, he saw the etherial vast</L>
<L>A clouded gloom, an undelightsome waste:</L>
<L>Around the extended wild, no sun's broad ray</L>
<L>Mark'd the clear splendour of immortal day;</L>
<L>No varying moon, ordain'd at eve to rise,</L>

<L>With tranquil beams the seventh bright morn appear'd,</L>

<L>To prayer, to praise, be all thy wishes given;</L>
<L>Soar from the world, and here begin thy heaven!</L>
<L>So shall thy sons pursue the virtuous road,</L>

<L>A solemn beauty earth and heaven array'd;</L>
<L>With joy the pinion'd tribes, in ev'ry grove,</L>
<L>Hymn'd the blest influence of immortal love.</L>
<L>Man join'd the concert: and his raptur'd lays</L>
<L>Charm'd the gay fields, when angels ceas'd to praise.</L>

Tainting with lust, and sloth, and pride, and rage,</L>
<L>The world around him: all the race beside.</L>
<L>Like brood of ostrich, left for chance to rear,</L>
<L>And every foot to trample. Reason's sway</L>
<L>Elective, founded on the rock of truth,</L>
<L>Wisdom their guide, and equal good their end,</L>
<L>They built with strength, that mocks the battering storm,</L>

<L>Hence every swain, free, happy, his own lord,</L>

<L>On this heav'n laid foundation rests thy sway;</L>
<L>On knowledge to discern, and sense to feel,</L>
<L>That free-born rule is life's perennial spring</L>

<L>For, could thy sons a full conviction feel,</L>

<L>Hence too each breast is steel'd for bold defence;</L>
<L>For each has much to lose. Chosen by all,</L>

<L>Hence manners mild, and sweet, their peaceful sway</L>

<L>The woodman's axe, the distant groves among,</L>

<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><LG>
<L>BESIDE yon lonely tree, whose branches bare</L>
<L>Rise white, and murmur to the passing air,</L>
<L>There, where the twining briars the yard enclose,</L>
<L>The house of Sloth stands hush'd in long repose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In a late round of solitary care,</L>
<L>My feet instinct to rove, they knew not where,</L>
<L>I thither come. With yellow blossoms gay,</L>
<L>The tall rank weed begirt the tangled way:</L>
<L>Curious to view, I forc'd a path between,</L>
<L>And climb'd the broken stale, and gaz'd the scene.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O'er an old well, the curb half fallen spread,</L>
<L>Whose boards, end-loose, a mournful creaking made;</L>
<L>Poiz'd on a leaning post, and ill-sustain'd,</L>
<L>In ruin <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, a mouldering swepe remain'd;</L>
<L>Useless, the crooked pole still dangling hung,</L>
<L>And, tied with thrumbs, a broken bucket swung.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A half-made wall around the garden lay,</L>
<L>Mended, in gaps, with brushwood in decay.</L>
<L>No culture through the woven briars was seen,</L>
<L>Save a few sickly plants of faded green:</L>
<L>The starv'd potatoe hung it's blasted seeds,</L>
<L>And fennel struggled to o'ertop the weeds.</L>
<L><PB N="206" REF="026795_0209_0FD1CE26C33C79D8"/>
There gaz'd a ragged sheep, with wild surprise,</L>
<L>And two lean geese upturn'd their slanting eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The cottage gap'd, with many a dismal yawn,</L>
<L>Where, rent to burn, the covering boards were gone;</L>
<L>Or, by one nail, where others endwise hung,</L>
<L>The sky look'd thro', and winds portentous rung.</L>
<L>In waves, the yielding roof appear'd to run,</L>
<L>And half the chimney-top was fallen down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The ancient cellar door, of structure rude,</L>
<L>With tatter'd garments calk'd, half open stood.</L>
<L>There, as I peep'd, I saw the ruin'd bin;</L>
<L>The sills were broke; the wall had crumbled in;</L>
<L>A few, long emptied casks lay mouldering round,</L>
<L>And wasted ashes sprinkled o'er the ground;</L>
<L>While, a sad sharer in the houshould ill,</L>
<L>A half-starv'd rat crawl'd out, and bade farewel.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>One window dim, a loop-hole to the sight,</L>
<L>Shed round the room a pale, penurious light;</L>
<L>Here rags gay-colour'd eked the broken glass;</L>
<L>There panes of wood supplied the vacant space.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As, pondering deep, I gaz'd, with gritty roar,</L>
<L>The hinges creak'd, and open stood the door.</L>
<L>Two little boys, half-naked from the waist,</L>

<LG>
<L>On a lean hammoc, once with feathers fill'd,</L>
<L>His limbs by dirty tatters ill conceal'd,</L>
<L>Tho' now the sun had rounded half the day,</L>
<L>Stretch'd at full length, the lounger snorting lay:</L>
<L>While his sad wife, beside her dresser stood,</L>
<L>And wash'd her hungry houshold's meagre food,</L>
<L>His aged sire, whose beard, and flowing hair,</L>
<L>Wav'd silvery, o'er his antiquated chair,</L>

Rose from his seat; and, as he watch'd my eye,</L>
<L>Deep from his bosom heav'd a mournful sigh—</L>
<L>Stranger, he cried, once better days I knew;</L>
<L>And, trembling, shed the venerable dew.</L>
<L>I wish'd a kind reply; but wish'd in vain;</L>
<L>No words came timely to relieve my pain:</L>
<L>To the poor parent, and her infants dear,</L>
<L>Two mites I gave, besprinkled with a tear;</L>
<L>And, fix'd again to see the wretched shed,</L>
<L>Withdrew in silence, clos'd the door, and fled.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet this so lazy man I've often seen</L>
<L>Hurrying, and bustling, round the busy green;</L>
<L>The loudest prater, in a blacksmith's shop;</L>
<L>The wisest statesman, o'er a drunken cup;</L>
<L>(His sharp-bon'd horse, the street that nightly fed,</L>
<L>Tied, many an hour, in yonder, tavern-shed)</L>
<L>In every gambling, racing match, abroad:</L>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>History <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that Sivard, King of Sweden, entered Nor∣way with a numerous army, and committed the great∣est enormities, but was at last overthrown, his Army routed, and himself slain by one of those women whom he had brutally abused.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LG>
<L>BETWEEN Norwegian hills, wide spreads a plain,</L>
<L>By Nature form'd for sport;</L>
<L>The vet'ran warrior here, and hardy swain,</L>
<L>To annual games resort.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>High o'er their heads was hung the hoary brow,</L>
<L>Which cast an ample shade;</L>
<L>From thence these words majestic seem'd to flow—</L>
<L>"Fierce foes your sports invade!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They upward gaze—a warrior struck their sight;</L>
<L>He bore aloft his lance,</L>
<L>All sheath'd in arms, insufferably bright,</L>
<L>Where beamy splendours dance.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The western sun beam round his helmet flies,</L>
<L>He more than man appears;</L>
<L>And more than mortal seem'd to sound the voice</L>
<L>That rang upon their ears.</L>
</LG>
<Q><LG>
<L>Ye sons of Norway! hearken to my tale,</L>
<L>Your rural games, oh cease;</L>
<L>Sivard is marching through Dulvellon's vale,</L>
<L>Break off the sports of peace!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The bloody Sivard leads his conqu'ring Swedes,</L>
<L>He riots in our shame;</L>
<L>The man, the matron, and the infant bleeds—</L>
<L>Norway is but a name!</L>

<PB N="216" REF="026795_0219_0FD1CE4273502F48"/>
<L>The husband sees—curse on the tyrant's lust—</L>
<L>He sees his beauteous bride—</L>
<L>Her virtue, worth and honour in the dust—</L>
<L>On where is Norway's pride!</L>
</LG>
<LG>

<L>Let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> o'er shade the brow;</L>
<L>Let's meet these Swedish demons on the plain,</L>
<L>And lay their triumphs low.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh had you seen what these poor eyes have seen!</L>
<L>'Twas Sivard did the deed—</L>
<L>Our hoary monarch, and our helpless queen,</L>
<L>I—yes, I saw them bleed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Their daughter Ella—no, I will not tell!</L>
<L>Norwegians ne'er enquire—</L>
<L>Ne'er hear it—what the royal maid befel;</L>
<L>I see your souls on sire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh seize your swords, your spears, your helms, and shields!</L>
<L>Oh vindicate your fame!</L>
<L>Sivard and Sweden glare on Norway's fields;</L>
<L>Remember Norway's name.</L>
</LG></Q>
<LG>
<L>He said, tears flow apace—fierce glow the swains,</L>
<L>Rage sills each honest breast;</L>
<L>In Swedish blood, to wipe away their stains</L>
<L>Was ev'ry thought addressed.</L>
</LG>
<L>Then red hair'd Rollo, fierce advancing, cried,</L>
<Q><LG>
<L>Whoe'er thou art, come down!</L>
<L>We live on hills, to ev'ry toil we're tried,</L>
<L>And war is all our own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let Sivard come, we'll meet the tyrant here.</L>
<L>But Stranger come thou down.</L>
</LG></Q>
<LG>
<L>He came; old Athold gaz'd with look severe;—</L>
<L>He gaz'd—but ceas'd to frown.</L>
</LG>
<L>Or Athold has forgot his monarch's face,</L>
<Q><LG>
<L>Or sure thou art his son!</L>
<L>Eric, of mighty Norway's royal race!—</L>
</LG></Q>
<L>Full quick the tidings run.</L>
<LG>
<PB N="217" REF="026795_0220_0FD1CE4A282972C8"/>
<L>With shouts they press to see the beauteous chief;</L>
<L>The aged kiss his hand!</L>
<L>On either side fast roll'd the marks of grief,</L>
<L>Then Athold spoke the band—</L>
</LG>
<Q><LG>
<L>Ye sons of Norway, to your homes repair,</L>
<L>There seize the sword and shield,</L>
<L>And ere the morning's purple streaks the air,</L>
<L>Meet Eric in the field.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh Prince! do you with aged Athold go,</L>
<L>And take refreshing sleep;</L>
<L>Athold will sing, and sooth the rising woe,</L>
<L>Or,—break his harp and weep.—</L>
</LG></Q>
<LG>
<L>'Twas night—in Athold's hall each took his place;</L>
<L>Of other times he sung;</L>
<L>Fast stream'd the tears adown the hero's face,</L>
<L>And groans responsive rung.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Bright came the morn! and bright in batter'd arms</L>
<L>The rustic vet'rans came;</L>
<L>And many a youth, untried in rough alarms,</L>
<L>Now hop'd a patriot's name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They heard from far the hum of Sivard's host;</L>
<L>Young Eric struck his shield;</L>
<L>Then high in air his heavy spear he tost,</L>
<L>And blaz'd along the field.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next aged Athold follow'd; Rollo strong;</L>
<L>Black Calmar lifts his mace;</L>
<L>Culullin, Marco, Streno, rush along,</L>
<L>And all the rugged race.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fierce came the Swede, in strength of numbers proud,</L>
<L>She scorn'd her feeble foe;</L>
<L>But soon the voice of battle roar'd aloud,</L>
<L>And many a Swede lay low.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Strong Rollo struck the towering Ol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us dead,</L>
<L>Fall fifteen bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d beside.</L>
<L>Old Athold cleft the brave Adolphu's head,</L>
<L>In all his youthful pride.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="218" REF="026795_0221_0FD18DB2CD88C478"/>
<L>But Eric' Eric! tang'd the field around,</L>
<L>On Sivard still he cried:</L>
<L>The gasping Swedes lay heap'd upon the ground—</L>
<L>Sivard! the hills reply'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In fury Sivard seiz'd his shining shield,</L>
<L>His mail, his helm and spear;</L>
<L>He mounts his car, he thunders o'er the field;</L>
<L>And Norway knows to fear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Great Rollo falls beneath his dreadful arm,</L>
<L>His steeds are stain'd with blood;</L>
<L>Young Eric smil'd to hear the loud alarm,</L>
<L>And flew to stop the flood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He rag'd, he foam'd,—fierce flew the thirsty spear,</L>
<L>Down fell the foremost steed:</L>
<L>Astonish'd Sivard felt unusual sear—</L>
<L>"Tyrant, thou'rt doom'd to bleed."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Up sprung the youth—deep griding fell the sword</L>
<L>Sunk in the Tyrant's brow;</L>
<L>Fast fly the Swedes, and leave their hated lord,</L>
<L>His tow'ring pride laid low.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now Norway's sons their great deliverer hail,</L>
<L>But lot he bleeds! he falls!</L>
<L>Old Athold strips the helm and beamy mail,</L>
<L>And on his Gods he calls.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He lifts the helm, and down the snowy neck</L>
<L>Fast falls the silky hair—</L>
<L>"And could those limbs, the conquering Sivard check,</L>
<L>Oh pow'r of great despair!—"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Life ebbs apace—she lifts her languid head,</L>
<L>She strives her hand to wave,</L>
<L>Confess'd to all, the beauteous Ella said—</L>
<L>"Thanks, thanks companions brave."</L>
</LG>
<Q><LG>
<L>Freedom rewards you—naught can Ella give:</L>
<L>Low, low, poor Ella lies;</L>
<L>Sivard is dead! and Ella would not live.</L>
</LG></Q>
<L>She bleeds, she faints, she dies.</L>

<HEAD>CHARACTER OF ST. TAMANY.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY WILLIAM PRICHARD.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>IMMORTAL Tamany, of Indian race,</L>
<L>Great in the field, and foremost in the chace!</L>
<L>No puny saint was he, with fasting pale,</L>
<L>He climb'd the mountain, and he swept the vale,</L>
<L>Rush'd thro' the torrent with unequall'd might;</L>
<L>Your ancient saints would tremble at the sight;</L>
<L><PB N="224" REF="026795_0227_0FD1CE59E8BBCBA0"/>
Caught the swift boar, and swifter deer, with case,</L>
<L>And work'd a thousand miracles like these.</L>
<L>To public views he added private ends,</L>
<L>And lov'd his country most, and next his friends;</L>
<L>With courage long he strove to ward the blow,</L>
<L>(Courage we all respect ev'n in a foe,)</L>
<L>And when each effort he in vain had tried,</L>
<L>Kindled the flame in which he bravely died!</L>
<L>Let the full horn to Tamany go round,</L>
<L>His same let every honest tongue resound!</L>
<L>With him let ev'ry gen'rous patriot vie,</L>
<L>To live in freedom, or with honour die.</L>
