<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OUR former Intimacy at the Universi∣ties in <HI>Holland</HI> and Hospitals in <HI>Flanders,</HI> inclined me to this Address. The Station which you have acquired by your Merit, being one of the highest which our <HI>Profession</HI> admits of, I mean of being <HI>a Court Physician,</HI> seems naturally to demand it, even at this distance. But more especial∣ly your knowledge in this Affair or Subject, obliges me to submit this Practical Essay upon the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> to your better Judg∣ment.</P>
<P>My former Inclinations to several branches of <HI>Natural History,</HI> I have now contracted to that of <HI>Medical Cases</HI>; more particular∣ly
<PB N="ii" REF="003275_0004_0FF0305ED90FE0D8"/>
I continue to make Observations concern∣ing the <HI>Endemial Distempers</HI> of this Coun∣try and Climate, especially of a certain Ano∣malous ill-conditioned <HI>Autumnal Fever</HI> which sometimes galls us much. In the Year <HI>1721.</HI> after an absence of about twenty years, the <HI>Small Pox</HI> rendred this large and populous Town of <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>New-England</HI> a meer Hospital; such Opportunities are seldom to be met with in <HI>Europe,</HI> and there being no like∣lihood of such another as to Numbers and Varieties in this Country in my Time; I secluded my self from all other Company but that of my Patients during the Small Pox Illness, and committed to writing for my own reminiscence and private use, the remarkable Small Pox Cases which occurred in a very extensive Practice. This last Summer after fifteen years abscence, the <HI>Measles</HI> prevailed here, which afforded me a very extraordinary Opportunity of observing the Varieties which attend that Distemper.</P>
<P>It is the duty of <HI>a Man,</HI> in times of any publick Calamity, to lend a helping hand, as his Station, Profession or Capacity may enable him: This induced me at this time, when the <HI>Small Pox</HI> begins to annoy the Town a∣gain,
<PB N="iii" REF="003275_0005_0FF0306131F30C60"/>
to reduce into some Method, the Ob∣servations I made concerning the <HI>Small Pox</HI> in <HI>Boston 1721.</HI> with what other know∣ledge I formerly had of this Distemper. <HI>Observations</HI> reduced to Method and Ana∣logy from thence is all we know or can learn in any Distemper. I have candidly and with∣out reserve imparted all that I know of this Disease, so far as can be reduced to writing in a short Abstract. I have by choice ex∣pressed some few things in the Words of some Celebrated Practitioners, rather than in my own. To have inserted <HI>Formulas</HI> of Medi∣cines would be trifling, they are soon conceiv∣ed where the Indications and Intentions are known. I designed to have interspersed <HI>His∣tories</HI> of remarkable Cases, by way of <HI>Prac∣tical Illustrations</HI>; but the nature of an Ab∣stract does not give room, and more especially being recent, most of the Subjects alive in the place, I was afraid it might not be so agree∣able, as certainly it would have been useful.</P>

<HEAD>A Practical Essay Concerning the Small Pox.</HEAD>
<P>WHERE the <HI>prima stamina Vitae</HI> are good, the whole Affair of <HI>Health and long Life</HI> would consist in <HI>Temperance and moderate Exercise,</HI> were it not for some <HI>malignant acute Diseases</HI> which have something <HI>Mysterious</HI> in their Nature, invading the healthy and Vala∣tudinarians indifferently: Of those some are <HI>En∣demial,</HI> peculiar to Countries, Climates, Seasons, and Constitutions of the Air; but <HI>not communica∣ble</HI> by Infection from Man to Man: Most Coun∣tries have at times <HI>Fevers</HI> of this kind, in this and the neighbouring Colonies, especially in the Au∣tumn we are afflicted with a certain <HI>febris mali moris,</HI> not reducible to any Classical Name of Fe∣vers
<PB N="2" REF="003275_0007_0FF0306534E6A5F8"/>
described by Authors. It begins as all Fevers do with <HI>Horripulations</HI> &amp;c. has no perfect Inter∣missions, but, without any more horrors, <HI>remissi∣ons and exacerbations</HI> sometimes periodical but more frequently uncertain, the Symptoms are va∣rious, being the most <HI>anomalous Fever</HI> that ever came to my knowledge; the most general Symp∣tom is <HI>oppressio gravitativa circa cordis regionem,</HI> which the Patients express by a pain at their Hearts, and in all Fevers except the Eruptive is reckoned a Symptom <HI>mali Ominis.</HI></P>
<P>Some <HI>malignant Fevers</HI> altho' originally <HI>Ende∣mial</HI> or the produce of Climates Seasons <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may by <HI>Infection</HI> be spread at home, and in some Con∣stitutions of the Air, may be conveyed and dis∣seminated in Countries abroad where they are not natives but <HI>Exoticks,</HI> and therefore cannot thrive so well there as in their native Soil. Thus the <HI>Plague</HI> Endemial in the <HI>Levant</HI> and <HI>Egypt,</HI> does sometimes get sooting in <HI>Europe</HI> (I cannot learn that it ever visited the <HI>American</HI> Continent) it was in <HI>London</HI> from 1602 to 1648, every Year there died a few of it, but did not spread except∣ing 1603, 1625 and 1636; ever since the Year 1665 notwithstanding a continued Trade to the <HI>Levant,</HI> it has not taken root in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Small Pox</HI> is a Disease of a more <HI>singular na∣ture,</HI> it is of a very uncertain Original, we know of no Country where it is a Native or <HI>Endemial,</HI> that is, where it is the produce of Seasons, Winds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as is the Plague in the <HI>Levant.</HI> It owes the continuation of its being to a <HI>variolous leaven</HI> com∣municable in all Countries and Seasons, but some Constitutions of Years favour its propagation and mortality more or less; from the <HI>London</HI> Bills of Mortality there died there of the <HI>Small Pox</HI> 1702 only 31, in the Year 1706 died 721, in the Year
<PB N="3" REF="003275_0008_0FF03067FA9C9F98" MS="y"/>
1719 dies 3229. There is another <HI>Circumstance very singular</HI> in its Nature, that it never affects a Person oftner than once; in the <HI>Plague</HI> some have died in the 2d, 3d, 4th <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Seisure, as Dr. <HI>Hod∣ges</HI> informs us: It is therefore an Infection essen∣tially different from the <HI>Pestilential,</HI> and cannot be the Effect of some ancient violent <HI>Plague in Egypt,</HI> as some Authors surmise.</P>
<P>We are beholden to the <HI>Arabians</HI> or <HI>Saracens,</HI> not only for many <HI>Drugs and Medicines,</HI> as <HI>the Purging Rhubarb, Manna, Mercurial Unguents, the Epispastick Use of the Cantharides,</HI> &amp;c. but also for the first Accounts we have of several Diseases, as <HI>Small Pox, Measles, Lepra Arabum, Spina ventosa. Vena Medini,</HI> or <HI>Guinea Worm,</HI> &amp;c. The <HI>Small Pox</HI> was a Stranger in Medicine until the Time that the <HI>Arabians</HI> or <HI>Saracens</HI> settled in <HI>Egypt,</HI> which was soon after <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Death. As this People in less than 30 Years did vastly propagate their <HI>Religion and Empire,</HI> so they did the <HI>Small Pox</HI> in a short Time, and might Introduce it in∣to <HI>Europe</HI> by Way of <HI>Spain,</HI> where they settled powerful Colonies. The various <HI>Exanthemata</HI> of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and <HI>Pustulae</HI> of the <HI>Romans,</HI> with other <HI>Eruptive Fevers</HI> mentioned by them, were no ways analagous to the <HI>Small Pox</HI>: At the Discovery of this Continent of <HI>America,</HI> not the least Resem∣blance of it was to be found.</P>
<P>The <HI>Small Pox</HI> is an <HI>Inflammatory Fever,</HI> but with a peculiar Malignancy or Poison; which requires the Indications of Cure to be taken principally <HI>ae juvantibus &amp; laedentibus.</HI> Inflammations, as purely such, require <HI>U. S.</HI> and the Body to be kept solu∣ble; but in the <HI>Small Pox</HI> the Body ought to be bound; and Dr. <HI>Sydenham</HI> gives us an Instance of a young Man, who, notwithstanding he had some short Time before Seisure been frequently let Blood
<PB N="4" REF="003275_0009_0FF0306BB7C1E530"/>
for <HI>Rheumatick</HI> Pains, had the worst Sort of conflu∣ent <HI>Small Pox</HI> he ever did see. In some Families, by a <HI>jus haereditarium,</HI> it is always very <HI>malignant,</HI> or fatal; thus Mrs. <HI>A</HI>— and her Daughter, Capt. <HI>R</HI>—'s Wife and her Child, two Children of <HI>F</HI>— a Fisherman, two Boys at <HI>L</HI>— Cousin Germans, all died with Purples and Haemorrhages, Mr. <HI>W</HI>— and his Sister died in the Innoculated Way: To other Families it is always favourable; Dr. <HI>Morton</HI> says, that he could not recollect, that any Person of his own or his Wife's Family ever died of the <HI>Small Pox.</HI> We find by Experience, that a <HI>confluent,</HI> or very: full Knid, does not always pro∣ceed from a more intense Inflammation of the Blood, or from driving by Cordials: Frequently it is in the Nature of the Person's <HI>Constitution</HI> to be so affected with the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> having very lit∣tle of a Fever, no Phrenzy, Coma, or any other violent Symptom; but meerly from a too profuse <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>puration,</HI> to die of a <HI>tabid Inanition,</HI> in all Sta∣ges of Life; thus died <HI>J. B</HI>— <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> an old Man, <HI>W. H</HI>— <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> a middle aged Man, <HI>W. S</HI>— a young Lad, <HI>M. G</HI>— Housekeeper, a young Woman whose Eruptions were too early after <HI>Inoculation.</HI> Further we may observe, that any violent Symp∣tom proceeding from an <HI>accidental Error,</HI> is not of that bad Consequence as if it did proceed from the <HI>Constitution</HI> in the natural Course of the Di∣stemper: Thus the Purples in <HI>J. C</HI>— at 19, were from <HI>violent Exercise,</HI> in running after Cattle in the Country a few Days before Seisure; Capt. <HI>T</HI>—'s Negro Man in a Confluent Sort, had <HI>bloody Urine,</HI> having lately received a Blow cross his Loins; Capt. <HI>H</HI>—'s Son, aet 5, had interspersed <HI>Vesicules</HI> full of a sharp <HI>blewish Serum,</HI> from an intense <HI>hot Regimen</HI>; they could not have survived these Symptoms if they had been <HI>Constitutional.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="003275_0010_0FF0306E41467E08"/>Most <HI>malignant Distempers</HI> have their <HI>Crisis</HI> in the Glands; the <HI>Plague</HI> in the Inguinal, Axillary, and Parotidal Glands; the <HI>Small Pox</HI> in the Miliary Glands of the Skin. The <HI>Caustick</HI> acrimonious Quality of the <HI>Small Pox</HI> Infection is evident from the Pittings. That this Malignity is <HI>colliquative</HI> appears by the profuse Sweatings or Diarrhaeas in some, in others Salivation, Swellings of Face, Ex∣tremities, <HI>Scroti &amp; Preputii,</HI> Diabetical <HI>Profluviums,</HI> Purples and <HI>Haemorrhages.</HI> The <HI>Small Pox</HI> seldom arrives to that Degree of Malignity, as to be at∣tended with sudden Death; there were but two Instances came to my Knowledge here, being both young Women, and <HI>died before Eruption,</HI> by a vi∣olent <HI>Necrosis</HI> of their Spirits, intense <HI>Coma</HI> and <HI>Stupor.</HI></P>
<P>The Cure of a <HI>Fever</HI> in the first Intention is by some <HI>Specifick</HI> to extinguish it, without allowing it to come to a <HI>Crisis</HI>; because <HI>Crisis's</HI> are frequently precarious: So that the Cure of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> properly speaking, is so to manage the infecting <HI>Miasma</HI> in the first Period or <HI>Apparatus</HI> of the Disease, that it shall not come to <HI>Eruption,</HI> i. e. Suppuration, with a tedious Train of Symptoms; thus if a Prickle or Splinter is lodged in the Finger, the proper direct Cure is <HI>Extraction,</HI> whereby Suppuration, Ulceration, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are prevented. If we could find an Antidote to destroy the <HI>Small Pox</HI> Infection in <HI>Embrio,</HI> it would be a genuine <HI>specifick</HI> Cure; we cannot say it is impossible, but hitherto it is not discovered to Mankind; may it be the Happiness of future Ages.</P>
<P>Next to a specifick Cure, would be <HI>a Method to alleviate</HI> the <HI>Crisis,</HI> as to the Quantity and de∣leterious Nature of the Inflammations and Suppu∣rations. The <HI>Circassian</HI> Method of procuring the <HI>Small Pox</HI> by <HI>variolous Pus,</HI> applied externally to
<PB N="6" REF="003275_0011_0FF0306FCB29E130"/>
fresh cutaneous Incisions, lately introduced in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and <HI>New England,</HI> seems to bid the fair∣est for this; but it is not an absolute certain Re∣medy against a bad Sort. Much of the same Na∣ture is what Dr. <HI>Williams</HI> of <HI>Haverfordwest,</HI> says, has been an imimemorial Custom in some Parts of <HI>Wales,</HI> called, <HI>buying of the Small Pox.</HI> The Person procures a few <HI>fresh Pocky Scabs,</HI> and holds them in the Hollow of the Hand a considerable Time; about 10 or 12 Days thereafter the Person sickens, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> An old Midwife, <HI>Jane Jones,</HI> aged 70, told him, that she knew it practised at Times above 50 Years, and knows but one dying of the Distemper so com∣municated. Considering the Cases of several of my Patients who had at the Time <HI>Issues,</HI> I was very inclinable to think, that by their Vent they did contribute towards alleviating the Distemper, par∣ticularly in <HI>Children</HI> abounding with <HI>gross Humours,</HI> or Faeculencies. <HI>Mercurialis</HI> says that he observ'd few to die of the <HI>Plague</HI> who ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Issues running.</P>
<P>What is commonly called, <HI>the Cure of the Small Pox</HI> at present, is only from the Experience of the <HI>juvantia &amp; laedentia,</HI> to prevent, alleviate, or re∣move the various disturbing <HI>Symptoms</HI> in the several Periods of this Disease. Formerly Practitioners were zealously bigotted, some to a <HI>cool Regimen,</HI> others to a <HI>hot Method,</HI> reckoning the opposite Practice of pernicious Consequence. That the Patient ought to be kept in a <HI>moderate natural Temper</HI> as near as can be, we learn from Experi∣ence. We find that Nature performs her Office best in a moderate Season; Heat dissipates, and Cold depresses the Spirits too much.</P>
<P>For the <HI>cool Regimen,</HI> Dr. <HI>Sydenham,</HI> ever to be celebrated for his Diligence in observing, and Can∣dor in communicating, was a great Stickler, espe∣cially in the former Years of his Practice, and has
<PB N="7" REF="003275_0012_0FF03072E6E4C1B0" MS="y"/>
been much blamed on that Head; but after more Years Experience, he was not so rigorous in this Method; and says, that after the <HI>Eruption com∣pleated,</HI> the Patient ought to be kept <HI>close a-bed,</HI> not so much as to expose an Arm or Hand, that by the agreeable and mild Heat of the Bed, the Plumpness of the <HI>Pustules</HI> may be kept up, as also the Swellings of Face and Hands. He considered it chiefly as an <HI>Inflammatory Disease,</HI> and he sup∣posed the <HI>Confluent,</HI> and other Bad Kinds, pro∣ceeded from the Fever assimulating and expelling of too much <HI>variolose</HI> Matter. I never observ'd any Benefit, but frequently Hurt, by exposing the Pa∣tients to the <HI>Air colder</HI> than the natural Temper of the Body required. I remember some Cases, where in the Eruption being <HI>exposed to the Cold,</HI> it was <HI>check'd</HI> for some Time; but soon after follow∣ed a <HI>second Crop</HI> generally mortal We find by Ex∣perience, that <HI>Intermitting Fevers,</HI> and such conti∣nued ones as are allied to them, are <HI>protracted</HI> by a cold Regimen. In other Diseases we may ob∣serve, that <HI>Coolers so retard</HI> the Circulation, that there may arise a Sort of Ferment from Stag∣nation; and instead of allaying Heat, may change a <HI>simple Inflammatory Fever,</HI> disposed to a <HI>Diapho∣resis,</HI> into a <HI>putrid</HI> and malignant one. In the <HI>Small Pox</HI> the more <HI>perspirable</HI> the Body, (I do not mean Sweating, which is a Colliquation) the better; thus we find, the Face, Neck, Arms and Hands, being continually exposed to the Air, are <HI>indura∣ted,</HI> and suffer most from the <HI>Small Pox.</HI> Extreme <HI>cold</HI> Weather is bad in all <HI>Eruptive Fevers</HI>: In 1713, the <HI>Measles</HI> raged here in the <HI>Winter,</HI> and there died about 150 Persons; in 1729, it prevailed in the <HI>Summer,</HI> and there died only about 15.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Hot Regimen,</HI> Dr. <HI>Morton</HI> and others al∣ledge, that some Part of the <HI>Virulency remaining
<PB N="8" REF="003275_0013_0FF030746F6E1318"/>
not protruded</HI> to the Surface of the Body, was the Reason of the <HI>Lucta,</HI> and Fever, and other Symp∣toms still continuing; and that this <HI>Languor</HI> of Nature <HI>protracts</HI> the Periods of Maturation and Desquammation to many Days; and therefore, the more malignant, the more generous <HI>Alexiphar∣micks</HI> are by them administred; thus by a <HI>hot Method,</HI> they inadvertently conspire with a most inflammatory Distemper to kill the Patient; the formerly received Notion of <HI>Alexipharmicks</HI> being <HI>Antidotes</HI> to Malignity, has by a dangerous vulgar Error, in violent <HI>inflammatory Cases,</HI> sent many prematurely to their cold Graves. I observ'd in the most malignant <HI>Small Pox</HI> with Purples and Haemorrhages, they immediately and most notori∣ously multiplied these Symptoms, and soon procu∣red an <HI>Exit. E. G</HI>— aet. 18, by generous <HI>Alex∣ipharmicks,</HI> had his Purples <HI>multiplied</HI> to Millions, with inflated purplish Eyelids, and bloody faetid Stools, <HI>expired soon,</HI> before the Eruption was com∣pleat. Capt. <HI>B</HI>—'s Child, <HI>aet.</HI> 8, having Purples, by this Method, the <HI>Blood was forced thro' the Pores</HI> of the Skin under the Nose, on the Lips, and Corners of the Eyes; with many others I could mention. <HI>Cordial Spirits and Volatiles</HI> in all Fevers push Nature <HI>precipitately</HI> to a <HI>Crisis,</HI> and besides other Inconveniencies, their natural Tendency be∣ing to the <HI>Brain,</HI> they solicite along with them∣selves the Violence of the Disease, occasioning <HI>Phrenzies, Delirias, Comas,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>It would be tedious to insert here the <HI>general Methods of Cure</HI> which have been used by the most celebrated Practitioners. Dr. <HI>Sydenham,</HI> by a cool Regimen, by acidulating all their Drinks with <HI>Sp. Vitriol.</HI> which he calls a Specifick in this Distem∣per, and by Paragoricks at Night, managed his Pa∣tients. Dr. <HI>Pitcairn</HI> lets Blood where there is
<PB N="9" REF="003275_0014_0FF030770241E180"/>
much of a Fever, and repeats it even after Erup∣tion, if the Fever continues; if the Pustules sub∣side too early, he lets Blood and blisters; he gives any simple Water in which Sheeps Dung is infused cold, and for common Drink Barley Water and Watergruel; in the Confluent Kind, towards the End, he opens the Body. Dr. <HI>Morton</HI> drives all before him with his Alexipharmicks or hot Method. D. <HI>Friend</HI> has very much obliged the World by re∣commending early Purging in the Declension in several Cases.</P>
<P>That I may be the more distinctly understood, I shall reduce my <HI>Subject</HI> under the following Heads.</P>

<HEAD>Small Pox Complexly considered.</HEAD>
<P>In the <HI>accidental Contagion,</HI> from Infection re∣ceived to Sickening, are 18 to 21 Days; from Observations which I made in several Families; and as to the Town in general, we may recol∣lect, that about the Middle of <HI>June,</HI> 1721, E∣ruptions appearing in many Houses, the Watches which had been appointed to prevent its Spread∣ing,
<PB N="10" REF="003275_0015_0FF0307A958BB770"/>
were discontinued; in the next Parcel of De∣cumbents, the Eruptions appeared about the 7th and 8th of <HI>July</HI>; and in the End of <HI>July,</HI> and Beginning of <HI>August</HI> it spread much. The Change and Full of the <HI>Moon</HI> may more or less <HI>dispose</HI> Bo∣dies to receive the Infection; but Sickening and Eruptions do happen in all Times of the Moon: In Southerly close Weather the Infection is most susceptible. In the <HI>Small Pox received by Incision</HI> the Patient sickens the 5th 6th or 7th Day, and af∣ter 1, 2, 3, or sometimes 4 Days, the Eruptions begin.</P>
<P>There are <HI>vast Varieties of the genuine</HI> Small Pox; but in general, <HI>the sooner</HI> the several <HI>Stadia</HI> are accomplished, the <HI>more benign</HI>; and most fre∣quently, the <HI>Danger</HI> is in Proportion to the <HI>Num∣ber of the Pustules</HI>: There are some Exceptions were a Distinct Sort has been very malignant, and even attended with Purples, Mr. <HI>F </HI>—'s <HI>Indian Peter,</HI> &amp;c. From the Quantity and Nature of the <HI>Pustules in the Face</HI> we generally judge of the more or less <HI>Violence</HI> of the Distemper. <HI>H. P</HI>— aet. 13, Face and Extremities confluent, but scarce any Pu∣stules in the Trunk of here Body; she died 11th from Eruption.</P>
<P>To form <HI>a general Idea of this Distemper,</HI> we must take the <HI>distinct plump Kind as a Standard.</HI> It may be described thus; begins with the com∣mon Symptoms of a Fever, but more particular∣ly is attended with <HI>Pain in the Head, Back and Loins, and about the Region of the Stomach, weep∣ing Eyes, Sore Throat. Vomitings, Dosedness, Startings, and in Children sometimes Convulsions. The End of the</HI> 3<HI>d, or Beginning of the</HI> 4<HI>th Day, the Small Pox Pustules begin to appear distinct</HI>; 5<HI>th they grow round and enlarge their Bases of a lively red,</HI> 6<HI>th Day they come to a Point,</HI> 7<HI>th the Points or Apices turn white,</HI> 8<HI>th they turn yellow,</HI> 9<HI>th they are full of lau∣dable

<P>We may comprehend all the <HI>Varieties of</HI> Small Pox under these. 1. <HI>A distinct dry Sort,</HI> being the most favourable of all; yet sometimes with consi∣derable Apparatus Symptoms; they are few, not large, Bases scarce inflamed, small Digestion, being hard with a little white Point; 5th or 6th Day from Eruption they begin to dry away, and gra∣dually vanish, leaving only a Freckle behind them, but no Redness; I have seen <HI>Indians</HI> with this Kind. 2. <HI>A distinct plump Kind,</HI> already described as the Standard. 3. <HI>The Cohaerent,</HI> or small fre∣quent Sort; they are not exactly round, pointed and vivid; but sessile and depressed, the Symptoms do not intirely cease upon Eruption, but after some Time they intermit until the <HI>Stadium</HI> of Maturation, then arises a Fever, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 4. <HI>The Con∣fluent,</HI> they appear sooner than the 4th Day, or are retarded by some violent Symptom later; their first Appearance is frequently <HI>Erisypilas</HI> like, and and at last appear of on Ash-coloured Crust or white Skin, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 6. To these add the Small Pox with interspersed <HI>Petechiae</HI> brown or red, with <HI>Vesiculae miliares,</HI> or small Blisters full of a limpid or bluish Serum, and with <HI>Purple Spots</HI> from the black to the more diluted Purples, and Haemorrha∣ges, which are more mortal than the Plague it sef.</P>
<P>Some general <HI>Directions</HI> for the <HI>Regimen in the Course of the Small Pox.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Let not Numbers be pent up in one Room,</HI> which can scarce contain Air enough for the Main∣tainance of Health in one single Person, especially if kept from Communication with the free exter∣nal

Air; for the <HI>Spring</HI> of the inspired <HI>Air</HI> is the continued Cause of the <HI>Circulation</HI> in our Bodies. 2. <HI>Where the Design of Nature is obvious, and her Intentions right, we ought not to disturb Nature by Medicines.</HI> 3. In this or any other acute Distem∣per, Nature or the <HI>Spirits ought not to be disturb'd by Noise or Confabulation.</HI> 4. Where Medicines are required, we are <HI>not to insist on any Medicine that continues to be disagreeable to the Stomach.</HI> 5. In this Distemper <HI>any violent Symptom appearing must be immediately obviated</HI>; Delays here are dan∣gerous: But we are to expect in this as in most other acute Distempers, that the Symptoms should have a Sort of Exacerbation towards Night. 6. <HI>Let not your Mixtures be too much compounded,</HI> that you may be the more certain of the Effects of the several Ingredients. 7. <HI>The Belly is not to be kept soluble.</HI> It is observ'd by every Body, that in the Small Pox (Dr. <HI>Friend</HI>'s Cases excepted) Opening of the Body by Catharticks, however mild, confounds the Course of Nature, and gives the <HI>Small Pox</HI> Fever a Determination to the Bow∣els of bad Consequence: The Body sometimes bound up for two Weeks, without any Inconve∣niency only the Pain of a labouring Stool at last, shows that this Distemper does not allow of Na∣ture's being disturb'd in her Office: If there hap∣pens in any of the <HI>Stadiums</HI> any undue Evacuation or Colliquation, use moderate Astringents, Opiats, and mild Cordials. 8. <HI>Avoid Grief, Study, intense Thinking, and the like</HI>; they hinder Perspiration, and all other Tendencies to the Surface or <HI>ad extra</HI> of the Body.</P>
<P>In the malignant Kinds, a Fever accompanies all the <HI>Stadia</HI>; the <HI>Absence or Presence of the Fe∣ver in the three last Stadia, Diliria, Vigilae, Stu∣por profundus, Subsultus tendinum, are always prin∣cipal
<PB N="13" REF="003275_0018_0FF03082D3A1CD78"/>
Indications of Safety or Danger.</HI> In this, as in all acute Diseases, we ought to <HI>observe the Pa∣tient's Pulse, Tongue, Urine, Breathing,</HI> as also the Eyes, Temper of the Skin, and Posture of laving. The best <HI>Pulse</HI> is the strong, full, equal, and slow; the nearer it approaches these the better. Be∣cause of the Continuation of the Membrane which invests the <HI>Tongue,</HI> with that of the Stomach and Intestines, Physicians judge of the inward Temper of the Body by the Aspect of the <HI>Tongue.</HI> In all Eruptive Fevers, the <HI>Urine</HI> settles from the Begin∣ning; <HI>Urine</HI> pretty high coloured with Contents is best, thin clear and pale is bad; where Sus∣pensions follow a laudable Sediment Nature is in Danger; large Quantity of <HI>Urine,</HI> especially if without any considerable Thirst, is always a good Symptom. <HI>Respiration</HI> is most to be attended to of all Symptoms; just upon the <HI>Crisis</HI> it may be <HI>magna &amp; celeris,</HI> and yet salutary.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Sydenham</HI> is much extolled from introducing <HI>Opiats</HI> into the Management of this Distemper. Dr. <HI>Morton</HI> says, without the Use of <HI>Laudanum</HI> not much is to be done in the Cure of the <HI>Small Pox.</HI> It is certain that Inquietudes, Watchings, Deliria and the like, so exhaust the Spirits in this Distemper, that they make the Use of <HI>Ano∣dynes</HI> unavoidable. <HI>Opiats</HI> relax the Skin, and give a proper Determination <HI>ad extra; Laudanum</HI> in that Sort of Small Pox which is accompanied with a Salivation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> concocts the Spittle, and promotes the Swelling of the Face and Hands. Discretion however is required in their Use; for where the Blood is languid, they leave the Pa∣tient more languid and faint, Tongues drier, Pulse weaker, gravitative Headakes, and the like: The indifferent Use of <HI>Narcoticks</HI> fix the faeculent Hu∣mours, and occasion <HI>Pittings and Scars.</HI> The <HI>Testa∣cea</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="003275_0019_0FF030854F47F4F0"/>
ought to supyly the Place of <HI>Opiats</HI> in Chil∣dren; for they moderate the inordinate Commo∣tion of the Blood more kindly and salutarily.</P>
<P><HI>Vesicatories</HI> by their <HI>Stimulus</HI> increase the Oscil∣lation of all the Fibres, and squeeze out the im∣pacted Contents. In <HI>Comatoes</HI> Cases the most ge∣nerous <HI>Alexipharmicks</HI> without <HI>Vesicatories,</HI> do not rouse the Spirits. <HI>Epispasticks,</HI> by their <HI>Stimulus,</HI> not only attenuate and derive the Humour to the Parts, but also discharge them: Translations of morbid Matter from one Part to another, is some∣times of the greatest Service, especially where it has a Discharge: All critical Evacuations are of this Nature. When Symptoms threaten the <HI>Brain, Vesicatories</HI> are of excellent Use, not neglecting <HI>suppedanea irritantia, live Animals,</HI> and the like, to the Soles of the Feet.</P>
<P>Let the Patient drink plentifully of diluting Li∣quors; for there is something <HI>Caustick</HI> and acri∣monious in the Infection. <HI>Herb Teas</HI> much used In this Country, I cannot recommend; they seem to wash away that soft mellow Moisture of the Mouth and Throat, and do frequently rather oc∣casion than alleviate Thirst: The more mellow Diluents I always found to answer better, as <HI>Bar∣ley Water, thin Water Gruel, Sack Whey, Vin. Ca∣narin. ad medias coct.</HI> as the Patient's Temper and Condition may require. After Eruption in all their Drinks and medicinal Mixtures give <HI>Sp. Vitriol, Sp. Sulph. per camp, Sp. Nitr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d.</HI> they keep the great Effer¦vescence of the Blood under, and as <HI>Sydenham</HI> says of the <HI>Sp Vitriol.</HI> are a Sort of Specifick against the variolous Putrefaction or Foeculency, shorten the <HI>Stadiums,</HI> prevent Pitting, and are a <HI>Succedaneum</HI> to <HI>U. S.</HI></P>
<P>As for <HI>Preservatives</HI> against the <HI>Small Pox</HI> Infec∣tion, we know of none really such, excepting <HI>Fly∣ing</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="003275_0020_0FF03087E8315E20"/>
from the Place where it rages. Some Consti∣tutions, and in some Seasons or Times, are more or less susceptible of it. Towards <HI>Prevention</HI> may conduce, the keeping the Mind <HI>chearful,</HI> and the the Body <HI>healthful.</HI> When the Vessels are im∣pregnated with rich Food, and generous Liquors (I do not extend this to <HI>Crapula</HI> and <HI>Ebriety,</HI> which are Violence done to Nature) we are less liable to receive the Injuries of the circumambi∣ent Air, as in catching cold, Epidemical contagious Distempers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> because the Excretories of Per∣spiration are full, and in a State of emptying, not imbibing; thus the Poor suffer most in Times of a Plague</P>

<HEAD>Preparatories.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The best <HI>Preparative</HI> for the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> is to keep the Mind as <HI>chearful,</HI> and the Body as <HI>health∣ful</HI> as we can. 2. <HI>Proper Evacuations, U. S.</HI> in the Plethorick, vigorous, and youthful, and in those who have accustomed themselves to <HI>U. S. Sydenham</HI>'s young Man who had been frequently blooded for Rheumatick Pains, was too much low∣ered; <HI>Purging</HI> in gross full Habits, but the <HI>Cathar∣ticks</HI> ought to be given some considerable Time before the Infection is received, lest they should weaken and dissipate the Spirits too much. 3. I found gentle <HI>Mercurials,</HI> as is <HI>AEthiop's Mineral,</HI> procured frequently a favourable <HI>Small Pox</HI> in Chil∣dren. 4. <HI>Issues,</HI> especially in Children, by their Vent and Derivation are found beneficial.</P>
<P><HI>Avoid violent Exercise</HI> when <HI>Small Pox</HI> is ex∣pected. <HI>I. C</HI>— from thence had a few Purples, and narrowly escaped. The Patient ought not to be <HI>kept too low</HI> in his Diet, lest the Eruption should
<PB N="16" REF="003275_0021_0FF0308A720E8F58"/>
not proceed so well. All Fevers when not distract∣ed by <HI>Anxiety</HI> perform their Course best; this is reckoned one of the Reasons why the <HI>Small Pox</HI> is most favourable to Children.</P>

<HEAD>Apparatus.</HEAD>
<P>Of all Distempers this especially requires Ad∣vice in the <HI>Apparatus,</HI> because on this depend all the other <HI>Stadia,</HI> altho' it is too common not to send for Advice until the Eruption. Unless you see some <HI>Exanthemata praenuncia,</HI> or Fore-runners of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> (especially when the Small Pox first enters a Town,) which sometimes appear the first Day of Seisure, be cautious how you foretel the Small Pox before Eruption; frequently in the Beginning the Feverish Symptoms are so gene∣ral, that we cannot say the <HI>Small Pox</HI> are to fol∣low, but by Conjecture, from the Decumbent's having never had them, and that he has lately been exposed to the Infection. In the Beginning of any Fever, <HI>v. g.</HI> of a <HI>Pleuritick Fever,</HI> we cannot posi∣tively say it is <HI>Pleuritick,</HI> before we observe the Determination to the <HI>Pleura.</HI></P>
<P>Seeing there are such very different Varieties, and sometimes contrary Indications in the follow∣ing Stages, in some the Spirits to be lowered, in others the Spirits to be raised, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> how <HI>Emiri∣cally</HI> do they act (the Care of a discreet Nurse on∣ly is much more safe) who in the first Stage, or <HI>Apparatus,</HI> indifferently tread the same Path, Blood-letting, or Alexipharmicks, or Emeticks, or Opiats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to all. We ought not, by <HI>Alexi∣pharmicks,</HI> to set Nature in a more violent Flame and Rage; neither are we by <HI>U. S.</HI> and other <HI>Evacuations,</HI> to depress the Spirits; but we ought
<PB N="17" REF="003275_0022_0FF0308D470BECB0"/>
to <HI>study Nature,</HI> and when all seems to be in a re∣gular Course, tending to its proper Periods in due Time, we are not to disturb Nature with Medi∣cines, but direct to a sutable Regimen, and a na∣tural Temperature, with a thin and spare Diet,</P>
<P>This <HI>Apparatus, or first Fever,</HI> is attended with some or all of the following Symptoms of Fevers in general, Chilliness, Shiverings, Horripulations, Yawning, Stretching, Giddiness; then Heat, Thirst, with Tongue foul or dry; Pulse stronger, quicker, unequal; a deficent Spittle, Loss of Appetite, Nau∣sea and Vomiting,; Pains in the Head, Back, and Loins; Inquietudes, or Comatoes Affections: Besides these, in Eruptive Fevers, particularly in the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> there is <HI>a certain Oppression circa cordis regionem, Sneezings, Coughs, Asthmatick Breathings, Hoarseness, Sore Throat, Weeping or Splendor of the Eyes, Dosedness, and sometimes in Children Convulsions.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Eruptive Fevers</HI> (in other Fevers such Symp∣toms only happen towards their fatal End) the <HI>Apparatus Symptoms</HI> are mostly <HI>nervosi generis,</HI> viz. <HI>Oppression at the Breast, Asthmatick Breathings, Vo∣mitings, Deliria, Comas, Lumbagos, tendinum Sub∣sultus, Insultus Epileptici</HI> in Children. Notwith∣standing this dismal Catalogue of Symptoms in some Constitutions, the Conflict between Nature and the Distemper is with so little Violence, as not to be sensible before the Eruption point it out; in others very few of these Symptoms are sensible, In some Constitutions with very malig∣nant Kinds, the Symptoms are mild; the <HI>Necrosis</HI> being so very intense, Nature is so oppressed from the Beginning as not to be capable of any <HI>Lucta</HI> or Struggle with the Distemper, as was the Case of many who died with <HI>Purples</HI> and <HI>Hoemorrhages.</HI> In some Constitutions, violent Symptoms in the
<PB N="18" REF="003275_0023_0FF0309070E3FDC0"/>
Beginning are not always followed by a bad Kind, providing that Weakness of the Pulse, and a lan∣guid Eruption do not concur. Mr. <HI>F</HI>— began with a strangled tumified Countenance, a <HI>Diarrhaea</HI> and <HI>Profluvium,</HI> threatning Purples; she had a distinct Kind, and did well. Several Children had violent Convulsions, but a favourable Kind of Small Pox soon appeared.</P>
<P><HI>Prognosticks.</HI> From the Intenseness and Conti∣nuance of the <HI>Horripulation,</HI> we judge of the Ha∣zard in all Fevers; in some rare Cases, the <HI>Necro∣sis</HI> is so Pestilence like, that this Symptom does not happen. <HI>A Bar</HI> cross the Chest (as they ex∣press it) with involuntary Sighings, Anxiety, De∣jection of Spirits and Despondency, great Com∣plaints of the Throat, violent fixed Spasmodick Pains, in Back, Sides, Loins, Bowels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are bad Symptoms; and according to their Intenseness ge∣nerally speaking, the more violent Small Pox does follow. <HI>Dolor versatilis</HI> of Sides, Limbs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are not so bad. <HI>A strangled boufi</HI> Countenance, with a Diarrhaea, frequently prognosticate Purples and Hoemorrhages. <HI>A dry Tongue,</HI> quick but weak vacillating Pulse, Urine clear thin and pale, in∣tense Coma, are bad Signs. <HI>Voiding</HI> of Urine in∣voluntary, or inscious (where there is no other violent Symptom) in the <HI>Apparatus,</HI> is no bad Symptom. <HI>H. P</HI>— aet. 18, <HI>M. R</HI>— aet. 15, had favourable Small Pox <HI>Notwithstanding</HI> the Vio∣lence of other Symptoms, if there be a true fe∣verish Heat, a strong and equal Pulse, Urine high coloured, with Contents, they indicate well the Strength of Nature.</P>
<P>Where the Symptoms are any ways considera∣ble, let the Patient immediately upon Seizure be <HI>put to Bed,</HI> but not with too many Cloaths. The Temper is not to be <HI>lowered</HI> too much by catch∣ing
<PB N="19" REF="003275_0024_0FF03093640EC620"/>
Cold, U. S. or any unnecessary Evacuation, so as to produce a late, imperfect, unequal, or se∣cond Crop, which are of bad Consequence; nei∣ther ought it to be <HI>raised</HI> by Cordials, and a hot Regimen, to drive the Humours into a Separati∣on more than was design'd by Nature, <HI>i. e.</HI> a con∣fluent, or very full Kind; as we are not to expect a kind Sort of Small Pox until the 4th Day, why should we endeavour to drive them sooner? The Blood may be thus so harrassed as not to allow of any regular Separation, but occasion an <HI>Erysi∣pelas</HI> like, or very unequal, or tardive Sort, which are the worst Kinds. <HI>Emollient Cataplasms,</HI> especi∣ally in Children, to the Feet, have been obser∣ved manifestly to alleviate the Symptoms, and sometimes to sollicite the <HI>variolous</HI> Matter more plentifully that Way, to the Relief of the other Parts.</P>
<P><HI>Blood letting</HI> in the Beginning, without any Exception, would be always useful, if the <HI>Small Pox</HI> were a simple inflammatory Case, and not complicated with some deleterious <HI>Miasma,</HI> which requires Strength of Nature to subsist under. Where there is a <HI>Plethora,</HI> U. S. is requisite to ease Nature of its Load, that it may the better perform its Office. In <HI>Athletick</HI> Habits, Wine∣bibbers, those accustomed to <HI>U. S.</HI> it is advisable, to prevent a too great Assimulation of variolose Matter. In <HI>violent Vomitings,</HI> violent spasmodick Pains of any Kind, intense Coma, or Convulsions threatning some Apoplectick Symptom, especially if the Pulse be strong, <HI>U. S.</HI> is necessary, and af∣terwards an Emetick, (in some Cases Anodynes) Vesicatories, a cool Regimen, and plentifully to dilute. <HI>Excepting in these,</HI> and the like Cases, <HI>U. S</HI> disturbs the Course of Nature, and a good <HI>Succedaneum</HI> for it is, a cool Method and Regi∣men.
<PB N="20" REF="003275_0025_0FF030965E954110"/>
<HI>In all Depressions,</HI> and Obstructions, if <HI>U. S.</HI> does not relieve, in confirms them, by lessening the Force of Circulation.</P>
<P><HI>Vomiturition in the Apparatus</HI> is from the Scene being in the nervous System; most Affections of the Nerves, <HI>v. g.</HI> Hysterical and Hypocondriacal Paroxysms, Concussions of the Brain, Nephritick Pains, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> occasion Vomiting; so that reaching to vomit does not always signify a foul Stomach. This Symptom ought to be left to it self, unless there be Suspicion of a foul Stomach, then an E∣metick is of use to clean the Stomach, and pre∣vent Foeculenies being carried into the Blood al∣ready morbid: In some Cases, by a universal Horripulation and Concussion, <HI>Vomiting</HI> conduces to render the Circulation more free. Let your <HI>Emeticks</HI> be gentle, not violent, lest they may dissipate and put the Oeconomy of the Spirits in too great a Hurry, and so divert the Eruption. My <HI>Emetick</HI> was generally <HI>Sal Vitriol.</HI> which oc∣casions no great Dissipation of Spirits, it is easily kept within Bounds, by its Astringency it streng∣thens the Stomach; it ought not to be forced downwards by too large Quantities of Drink, but rather repeat small Doses of the Salt.</P>
<P><HI>Where the Symptoms threaten the Brain,</HI> apply Vesicatories. We are to take Notice that a <HI>Stu∣por</HI> is peculiar to this Distemper, and is not of bad Consequence, unless it turns to an intense <HI>Coma.</HI> In Childrens Convulsions and Comatoes Affections preceeding Eruption, if violent, don't glyster, nor confound Nature by Evacuations, but blister and give moderate Cordials. <HI>Vigiliae and Deliria</HI> are in this Distemper worse Symptoms, because they waste and confound the Spirits; when the Pulse is strong, <HI>U. S.</HI> and Vesicatories are good, but espe∣cially <HI>Opiats</HI> (<HI>Sydenham</HI> will ever be celebrated

<P><HI>A Diarrhaea,</HI> especially if attend with Gripings, in this, and all other Fevers, (a few excepted where it is critical) confound the Courfe of Na∣ture, and must be moderated by Opiats, which will not retard the Eruption so much as the Pur∣ging would have done.</P>

<HEAD>Eruption.</HEAD>
<P><HI>The End of the</HI> 3<HI>d or Beginning of the</HI> 4<HI>th Day the best Sort appeared with us,</HI> An. 1721; so much as the Eruption anteverts the 4th Day, or is re∣tarded beyond it, so much greater the Danger; either from the Violence of the Fever, or hot Regimen, in the first Cafe; for the more violent and hasty any Inflammation is in its Course, the Danger of a subsequent Gangrene is the more to be apprehended. Dr. <HI>Huxham</HI> says, that <HI>An.</HI> 1724, 1725, there was in <HI>Plymouth</HI> an anomalous <HI>Small Pox,</HI> that appeared in less than 24 Hours after Seizure, and was always of the fluxed Kind: The other Case of being retarded, is from a too cool Regimen, officious Bleeding, catching cold, or some considerable Evacuation.</P>
<P><HI>The more universal the Appearance is at first,</HI> the more perfect and more benign is the <HI>Crisis</HI>; the more gradual, especially with new Sprouts in the Interstices, the more imperfect is the Crisis, and the Distemper is the more malignant. <HI>F. S</HI>— aet. 22, no violent Complaint <HI>in Apparatu,</HI> 1st and 2d Day of Eruption came out like a distinct good Sort, but the 3d Day came out infinite Multitudes of a small Purplish Pox, he died 17th of Seizure.
<PB N="22" REF="003275_0027_0FF0309BD7450BE8"/>
<HI>W. W</HI>— aet. 25, violent Pain at his Stomach, and dull, was <HI>U. S. in Apparatu,</HI> the Eruption very slow and languid, so as not to appear in the Ex∣tremities until the 3d or 4th of Eruption, a di∣stinct, but frequent sessile Kind; he spit, and swell'd well, died 14th of Seizure. Mr. <HI>H—r,</HI> aet. 30, a few Purples, with <HI>Haemorrhagia narium,</HI> the Pox in his Face had the regular Course of the con∣fluent Kind, but in his Extremities, at the Time of his Death, being 14th of Seizure, the Pustules had scarce begun to maturate. Mrs. <HI>Y</HI>— aet. 20, just having given over Suckling, violent Pain in her Back, and Reachings, was brought from an adja∣cent Island to <HI>Boston,</HI> 2d of Seizure some Appear∣ance of <HI>Small Pox,</HI> and after 3 or 4 Days more a Sort of second Crop, reddish, with some watery Blisters interspersed, she did not spit, a continued <HI>Nausea</HI> and <HI>Delirium,</HI> died 16th of Seizure. <HI>B. I</HI>— aet. 1, by catching cold the Eruption is checked, and after two Days came out a second Crop, of a very unequal crude Kind, she died soon.</P>
<P>The Eruptions appearing in the <HI>Extremities</HI> be∣fore they appear in the <HI>Face,</HI> presage ill, as in ma∣ny of the Purple Cases, being from a stifled Fever; for the Circulation being freer in the Extremities, the Eruptions come out there more kindly.</P>
<P><HI>If there attends the Eruption a profuse Sweating, Ptyalism, Menstruatio tempore non debito, Diar∣rhaea,</HI> &amp;c. they are bad Symptoms; because they denote much of a Colliquation, and divert Na∣ture from her principal Work. <HI>Sweating</HI> is a Sepa∣ration of a different Nature from that of the Small Pox; and therefore by Reason of its Di∣version it is not to be encouraged; a gentle Breath∣ing and Relaxation of the external Habit, solicites the Eruption, and is good. A <HI>Diarrhaea torminosa</HI> (unless from an habitual Colick, as in Mr. <HI>L</HI>—'s

<HI>Negroe Caesar</HI>) even in Children is no good Symp∣tom; with us it frequently attended the Erup∣tion in Children, and might be sometimes a Com∣plication with that Looseness incident to Children in the Autumn, or from Worms.

<P>Upon the Eruption the <HI>Throat complains.</HI> The <HI>Ptyalism</HI> begins with the Eruption.</P>
<P>A <HI>Christalline Small Pox</HI> is a Colliquation, and therefore not good. <HI>Looseness</HI> with a very hot Temper presage a confluent Sort. The <HI>Confluent</HI> Sort appear sooner than the 4th Day, or by some violent Symptom are retarded until after the 4th Day; the Symptoms continue after Eruption; they make their first Appearance <HI>Erysipelas</HI> like.</P>
<P>Strong <HI>Diaphoreticks</HI> in any Fever, administred before a perfect Concoction of the morbifick Mat∣ter, carry the Humours crude into the Brain, oc∣casioning <HI>Deliria, Comas, Convulsions</HI>; they likewise dissipate and expend the smooth <HI>Lympha</HI> of the Blood. <HI>Opiats</HI> in some Cases, administred with Discretion, by their relaxing Quality, conduce to the Eruption of the <HI>Small Pox</HI>; it has been a ge∣nerally received Opinion, that they check all Se∣cretions, but in <HI>partu dissicili, &amp; Lochiorum fluxu impedito,</HI> the modern Physicians find nothing more serviceable.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Winter Small Pox,</HI> Coughs, and Sore Throats, are great Complaints; they occasion Want of Rest, and Sleep, and exhaust the Spi∣rits; therefore if very troublesome, give <HI>Ano∣dynes</HI> with Discretion, and a light <HI>Pectoral</HI> De∣coction for their common Drink; guard the Chops with Flannels.</P>

<P>After 3 Days Inflammation the <HI>Pustules begin to digest</HI>; where the Eruption was protracted, in the same Manner the Digestion is <HI>protracted</HI>; first in the Face and Neck, afterwards gradually in the Trunk and Extremities, the lower Ex∣tremities being last: The Duration of the Period of <HI>Maturation</HI> in bad Kinds is very uncertain, (it is reckoned to continue until the Declension begins) especially when accompanyed with a Sa∣livation, and Swellings, and may be protracted to 10 or 12 Days, the longer always the worse: Where Nature is very low, and no <HI>Succedaneum</HI> happens, the Fever and other bad Symptoms may continue to the 18th Day before there is a per∣fect Maturation.</P>
<P>A <HI>round, florid, and turgid Pox</HI> is the Standard of Goodness. A turgid <HI>Pox,</HI> with florid Intersti∣ces, from white becoming yellowish, promise well in all Kinds: The frequent small, but distinct Sort called the <HI>Cohaerent,</HI> if they be nearly round, after 3, 4, or 5 Days of Maturation, the Patient may do well without Spitting; if they are very close, in the Maturation they enlarge their Bases so much as to flow together; with a protracted Matura∣tion, they continue depressed and watery some Time before they turn yellowish, and are saved by a <HI>Ptyalism,</HI> Swelling of Face and Hands, and sometimes by a <HI>Diabetical Profluvium.</HI> A few, without Spitting or Purging, in a true confluent Sort, did well.

if there appear in the Interstices several <HI>miliary</HI> Blisters or Pustules, some filled with a limpid <HI>Serum,</HI> others of a dark red, it is generally an ill Symptom, but some survive it. In the Matu∣ration and Declension, some small Eruptions some∣times appear in the Interstices, and dry away a∣gain the same Day, without any Thing bad to be apprehended.</P>
<P>Frequently the Pustules ripening inflame the whole Habit, and occasion Inquietudes; the Pa∣tient becomes hotter, and Pulse higher, which disturb Nature in her Course; this is called the Second, or <HI>Maturation Fever</HI>: Here <HI>Paragoricks</HI> (beginning the 6th Day) are as much a Speci∣fick as the <HI>Cortex Peruv.</HI> in Intermittents. Some∣times <HI>U. S.</HI> is required. Sometimes a Salivation, with Swellings of Face and Hands, or <HI>Diabetical Profluvium,</HI> put off the Return of the Violence of the Fever. Women frequently have a <HI>Profluvium Mensium,</HI> 1st or 2d Day of Maturation, even <HI>tem∣pore non debito,</HI> but it goes off gradually in a Day or two. <HI>A difficult Swallowing,</HI> if only from the Small Pox in the Throat, or <HI>Fauces,</HI> is tedious, but not a mortal Symptom; a Vesicatory to the Nape of the Neck is of Use. When any <HI>Subsi∣dence of Pox,</HI> or Swellings of Face, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> happen too soon, give <HI>Alexipharmicks</HI> (I do not mean Spirituous Cordials, which are apt to raise <HI>febrile</HI> Effervescences of bad Consequence) as <HI>Vin. Cana∣rin. ad med. coct. Theriaca, Rad. Serp. Virgin, Be∣zoar, Lap. Contrayer v,</HI> &amp;c. Vesicatories also must be used to rouse the Spirits.</P>
<P><HI>Salivation</HI> does not belong to a good Kind, and is only a <HI>Succedaneum</HI>; I observed that in some, tho' very full, without any considerable Spitting or Swelling, the Distemper had its Course more kindly and safely, than in others who from a kind

of malignant Colliquation, spit profusely, and swell very much; where it is Nature's last Resource, it is very uncertain in the Event; <HI>W. W</HI>— aet. 25, dies 11th of Eruption, after having spit freely, with Face and Hands at his <HI>Exit</HI> well swelled. It frequently begins with the Eruption, and ought not to decline until about the 11th of Illness; it is at first thin, but afterwards thick and ropy, and therefore requires Diluents plentifully; if too tough and choky, use Gargles made of <HI>Barley-Water, decoct. Rad. Alth.</HI> and the like, with <HI>Mel. Rosar, Syrup Violar, Oxymel,</HI> &amp;c. If Suffocation is feared, or if the Phlegm seem to lay low, give gentle <HI>Emeticks</HI>; I have given <HI>Cinabar. Nativ,</HI> and have ventured small Doses of <HI>Calomel</HI> in a slow viscid tough Salivation with some Benefit: I can∣not recommend it but to the Discreet, it fuseth too much, the Distemper it self being colliquative, it may occasion a <HI>Tabid Inanition.</HI> If any <HI>febrile</HI> Efflorescence divert its Course, we must have Re∣gard to the Fever. Swellings of Face and Hands, sometimes <HI>Scroti &amp; Preputii,</HI> or diabetical <HI>Proflu∣viums,</HI> come on as Subsidaries to the Salivation in its Declension; at the Time when we are to expect the Swelling of the Hands, <HI>Epispasticks</HI> to the Wrists may sollicite the Humours thither, and the running of these Blisters sometimes sup∣plies the Defect of Spitting. As the Eruptions on the Hands are later than those on the Face, so are their Swellings. In cold Weather Saliva∣tion does not go on so kindly as at other Times. <HI>Purging</HI> sometimes must be used to supply a defi∣cient Salivation.</P>
<P>Continued <HI>Nauseas</HI> a bad Sign. Sudden Chil∣liness, Shiverings, <HI>Diarrhaea, Vigiliae pertinaces, De∣liria,</HI> and other violent Symptoms, not to be laid by <HI>Opiats,</HI> portend a sudden Dissolution: If with

<P>The Absence of Symptoms, with a craving Ap∣petite, are good Signs; the Return, or Increase of a Fever are bad. Scarce any (Purples and Hae∣morrhages excepted, who die in all Stadia, accor∣ding to the Degree of their <HI>pestiferous</HI> Malignity) die but in the Declension; but this Period does sometimes begin with the first of Maturation, or at any Time of the Maturation protracted, but not perfected.</P>
<P>In the Turning, the more the <HI>Scab</HI> approaches to a <HI>Bees Wax</HI> yellow Colour, the more benign. In the <HI>Cohaerent,</HI> which at length arrive to a com∣pleat Maturation, even with Spittings and Swel∣lings, the Declension is equally favourable as in the Distinct, only the Patient complains more of be∣ing faint. In some Constitutions, altho' the <HI>Pu∣stules</HI> be large, distinct, and not frequent, this Pe∣riod was longer than usual (especially if <HI>Opiats</HI> are much used) with a cadaverous Stench, and leaving deep Pits, Mrs. <HI>F</HI>— aet. 30.

Generally speaking, af∣ter a protracted Maturation, assisted by Salivation and Swellings, the <HI>Pox</HI> do not begin to decline until the 13th or 14th Day; some are not out of Danger until the 21st; <HI>T.

<P>When the Pus is reabsorbed by the circulating Fluid, or when the dry inseparable Crusts return the Foeculency into the Mass of Blood, happens a third Fever (the first is in the <HI>Apparatus,</HI> called <HI>Eruptive Fever,</HI> the second is in the <HI>Maturation,</HI> from the Inflammation of the <HI>Phlegmones</HI>) being of a putrid Kind, and kills some the 11th, 14th, 17th, 21st, 24th Day of Illness, being Critical Days; if Blisters are thought requisite, let them be ap∣plied the Night preceeding the Critical Days, and not delayed until the Fever rises, because they add to the Heat and Effervescence of the Blood. This <HI>putrid Fever</HI> requires immediate <HI>U. S.</HI> then cool∣ing gentle <HI>Catharticks,</HI> especially if the Incrustation is such that the Matter is too thick to be further absorb'd; for the <HI>Guts,</HI> besides the Inconveniencies of being stuffed with Impurities, some Part of their foeculent Contents re-enter by the <HI>Lacteals,</HI> and are a <HI>Pabulum</HI> to the Fever. As a late Au∣thor well observes, upon a Retrocession of Swel∣lings, or any unlucky Translation upon the Vi∣tals, it is easier directly to solicite the <HI>Intestines</HI> to a Discharge than the Salival Glands, or Uri∣nary Ducts.

<P><HI>Purple Spots</HI> appear in the <HI>Apparatus</HI> and Erup∣tion Periods, the <HI>Petechiae</HI> generally appear late; both discover themselves first on the Breast, Neck, and Arms. <HI>Miliary Blisters</HI> and <HI>Petechiae,</HI> their Increase in Number of Dimensions portend ill, their Decrease are somewhat promising, being Signs of a more or less Intenseness of the <HI>Caustick</HI> Affection, some few recovered; with <HI>Purple Spots</HI> and <HI>Haemorrhages</HI> scarce any surviv'd; the three Cases that came to my Knowledge were not pro∣perly such in the Nature of the Distemper; Mr. <HI>D</HI>—'s <HI>Indian</HI> Boy, <HI>aet.</HI> 13, with a confluent Kind, his few and small pale Spots, considering the <HI>In∣dian</HI> Complexion, are rather to be reckoned <HI>Pete∣chiae; I.

<P>Some Families Blood is more apt to be fused by the Small Pox Infection than others, as I in∣stanced before.

The Degrees of <HI>Spots</HI> are, black the most malignant, purple, blue, red, brown, dusky, with their greater or smaller Dimensions. Purple Spots, if they increase in Numbers or Dimensions, denunciate some impend∣ing Haemorrhage, and soon after the Catastrophe. <HI>E.

<P>In these 65 Cases, 20 had Purples only without Haemorrhages; one <HI>D. I.</HI> aet. 15, had no Purples, but Spittle and Urine dilutely tinctur'd with Blood; the 44 following, besides <HI>Purples had Haemorrhages,</HI> viz. bloody Urine 6, <HI>Profluvium</HI> (I mean <HI>mulie∣bre</HI>) 5, bloody Spittle 11, Haemorrhage at the Nose 2, bloody Stools 1, Urine and Spittle 1, U∣rine Stools and Spittle 1, Urine Spittle and <HI>Pro∣fluvium</HI> 1, Urine and at the Nose Spittle and Stools 1, <HI>Profluvium</HI> and at the Nose 1, <HI>Profluvium</HI> and Spittle 2, Stools and at the Nose 2, Stools and
<PB N="38" REF="003275_0043_0FEFDAA6ECD5F378"/>
Spittle 3, Stools and Vomiting 3, Stools Spittle and Vomiting 1, Vomiting and by the Pores of the Skin under the Nose, and at the Corners of the Eyes 1, at the Gums and Mouth 1, Mrs. <HI>W.</HI>'s <HI>Indian</HI> Woman, 6th of Illness suddenly seized with all Sorts of Haemorrhages, soon dies wallowing in her Blood.</P>
<P>These 65 died at various Periods, reckoning from the Beginning of their Illness. With <HI>Purples only,</HI> dies fourth Day of Illness 2, fifth <HI>Day</HI> 5, sixth Day 1, seventh Day 1, ninth Day 4, eleventh Day 2, fourteenth Day 3, seventeenth Day 2. With <HI>Haemorrhages only,</HI> the eighth Day 1: With <HI>Pur∣ples and Haemorrhages,</HI> the third Day dies 1, fourth Day 6, fifth Day 6, sixth Day 12, seventh Day 6, ninth Day 5, tenth Day 1, eleventh Day 1, twelfth Day 1, thirteenth Day 2, fourteenth Day 2, se∣venteenth Day 1, being only a Haemorrhage at the Nose, which did not continue:</P>
<P>Hence we may learn that no <HI>Ages nor Sex</HI> are exempted from Purples and Haemorrhages. Mrs. <HI>C.</HI> was 60 <HI>aet.</HI> Capt. <HI>C.</HI>'s Child 6 Months old. 2. Of the various Races or Species of Mankind, if we may so express it, the <HI>American Indians</HI> are the most liable to them, and the <HI>African Negroes</HI> the least; altho' in the Year 1721 our <HI>Negroe</HI> Slaves were ten Times the Number of our <HI>Indian,</HI> (the Province having discouraged the Importation of <HI>Spanish Indians,</HI> because of their valetudinary state of Health) there died 7 <HI>Indians,</HI> but not one <HI>Negroe</HI> with these dismal Symptoms. 3. <HI>Preg∣nant Women</HI> are in some Danger of Purples and Haemorrhages.</P>
