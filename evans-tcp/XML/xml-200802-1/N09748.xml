<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE painful circumstances in which numbers are involved, when aged, or deprived of that, or those, on whom their support chiefly depended, are too no∣torious to require a recital. But that same Divine Wisdom, which allows and orders the existence of these calamities, has mercifully, and in proof of his providence, so directed its manner, as to admit of their being greatly alleviated, by the joint endeavours of mankind. Casualties, decays and death cannot be prevented, and separately considered appear to be un∣der no particular regulation; and yet, when viewed collectively, are in a certain proportion, as has been confirmed by long and repeated observation; so that many, by co-operating with each other, may secure individuals from those hardships they must otherwise experience; and that, on terms with which a reason∣able and humane person will readily comply, for the relief it must afford him to recollect, that he and his family are thereby insured, tho' in the other way they should never be benefited. An attention to these par∣ticulars has given rise to various Societies in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> which within a few years have multiplied a∣pace, chiefly in <HI>London.</HI> Though such Societies have been formed with a good design, yet having in gene∣ral gone upon mistaken principles, they must at length, if not speedily regulated, be productive of much dis∣appointment and calamity.</P>
<P>A benevolent desire of informing the public what calculations might be depended upon, and of averting that distress which was otherwise to be expected, has induced the Rev. Dr. <HI>Price,</HI> an eminent Mathematici∣an, to publish Observations on Reversionary Payments
<PB N="ii" REF="012406_0003_0F897774545F5118"/>
on schemes for providing Annuities, for Widows, and for persons in Old Age, &amp;c. Being possest of this help, a manuscript copy of the whole Constitution of the <HI>London</HI> Annuity Society, established by deed in∣rolled in 1765, to make annual provision for widows; and a printed Abstract of the Deed of Settlement of the Laudable Society, for the benefit of widows, be∣gun in 1761—understanding, that there were no general Societies of this nature in <HI>America,</HI> and that the e∣rection of such was wished for by many—and having a desire of contributing my mite towards the happi∣ness of the Colonists, more especially since a personal acquaintance with and numerous obligations to them, have here collected together, and do present to the public, materials for forming such Societies, wishing that the same may prove of extensive service, at least hoping that they will meet with a favourable recepti∣on. The <HI>first</HI> part contains the plan for the erection, continuance and government of the Society, with the various reasons: the <HI>second,</HI> the payments to be made by each member, according to his respective age, and the advantages he proposes to obtain. The scheme is larger than those of the <HI>London</HI> Societies, as it admits of the purchasing annuities to be enjoyed, either by the purchaser after such a period, or by another after his death in case of survivorship; and, notwithstanding difference of age, upon proper allowance—affords parents the opportunity of purchasing for their children, bre∣thren for their sisters and the like—does not exclude females from becoming purchasers—nor debar military and sea-faring persons, from securing annuities to be enjoyed by them after such an age, though from pur∣chasing annuities for others after their own decease.</P>
<P>Should such a Society be attempted and formed, shall chearfully afford it what further assistance may at
<PB N="iii" REF="012406_0004_0F897774EE89A688"/>
any time be in my power; and, that none may be mis∣led by errors in any spurious edition of this pamphlet, shall subscribe my name to every copy.</P>
<P>Many might decline forming themselves, notwith∣standing their desires, of having such a Society establish∣ed, and of belonging thereto, from an apprehension of their being too few. To obviate so plausible an ob∣jection, let it be noted, that the <HI>London Annuity So∣ciety</HI> when it first formed, the beginning of 1765, con∣sisted of no more than twenty-one members. The beginning of this year it consisted of 335. Would not with to begin such a Society with more than forty, or fifty persons at most, as it will probably be far more easy for that number, than a much greater, to regu∣late every matter, to be concluded upon at its forma∣tion.</P>
<P>The honest fears of some, and the interested views of others, may lead many to assert that a Society of this nature cannot be carried on without the immediate assistance of able mathematicians; especially as Dr. <HI>Price</HI> thus expresses himself, p. 131, speaking of the Society for equitable Assurances on Lives, viz. <Q>I would observe, that it is of great importance to the safe∣ty of such a Society, that its affairs should be un∣der the inspection of able mathematicians. Me∣lancholy experience shews, that none but mathema∣ticians are qualified for forming and <HI>conducting</HI> schemes of this kind.</Q> 'Tis indisputable, that this passage was hastily worded, and that the Doctor had forgot for a moment what he himself had been doing, for in p. 133, he says, <Q>I have, with a particular view to this Society, given <HI>rules,</HI> by which may be formed <HI>every</HI> Table it can want, for shewing the values of assurances on the <HI>whole duration,</HI> or any <HI>terms,</HI> of any <HI>one</HI> or <HI>two</HI> lives, in all possible cases;
<PB N="iv" REF="012406_0005_0F897775AF6E9018"/>
and nothing but care and attention can be necessary to enable any good arithmetician to calculate from them.</Q> By the Doctor's own rules any such arithme∣tician may try the calculations in this performance, may correct any mistakes, may supply all defects, and may adopt other terms at pleasure.</P>
<P>It may be agreeable to the reader of Dr. <HI>Price</HI>'s work, to be told, that after its publication the last year, several gentlemen of <HI>London</HI> were engaged in obtaining information as to the duration of life, both in men and women; and found that men in <HI>London,</HI> of good common health and exposed to no particular dangers, from twenty-four to the extremity of old age, die at the rate of one in thirty-one annually; and that, according to the registers of the Million Bank, widows may live eighteen years; according to those of the Mercer's Company (which in the year 1690 adopted a scheme for paying annuities to widows) twenty-one years on an average.</P>
<P>Such Societies, besides being serviceable to individu∣als, will, after a while, prove of great public utility; not only by encouraging matrimony, but by furnishing large sums of money to be loaned out; through the help of which, young industrious planters may push their improvements to the further enrichment of the community; others may be assisted in large and pro∣fitable undertakings; and interest may be reduced to a more moderate state, or the exacting userer's methods of increasing it beyond what is legal, be pre∣vented.</P>
<P>It being a public advantage, that there should be a full supply of money to loan out; and the nature of the country (comparatively, but little settled) not allowing the thought of a redundancy, it may be prudent to extend the limits, comprehending the members of the
<PB N="v" REF="012406_0006_0F8977766F30EAD8"/>
Society, beyond the bounds of a particular Colony, as far as an equal degree of healthiness and safety will admit, that so the cash of individuals, in those provin∣ces where such Societies do not exist, may centre where they do.</P>
<P>Tho' foreign to the present purpose, yet as it may be pleasing to the generality of readers, who may have no opportunity of seeing Dr. <HI>Price</HI>'s performance, the following particulars are added.</P>
<P>The Doctor writes, p. 204, 205. <Q>The original number of persons, who in 1643, had settled in <HI>New-England</HI> was 21,200. Ever since it is reckoned, that more have left them than have gone to them. In the year 1760, they were increased to half a million. They, have, therefore, all along doubled their own number in twenty-five years. And if they continue to increase in the same rate, they will, seventy years hence, in <HI>New-England</HI> alone, be four millions; and in all <HI>North-America,</HI> above twice the number of inhabitants in <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></Q> The Doctor sub∣joins in a note, <Q>Since writing the above—I have seen a particular account, grounded chiefly on surveys lately taken with a view to taxation and for other purposes, of the number of males between 16 and 60, in the four provinces. According to this ac∣acount, the number of such males is 218,000. The whole number of people therefore between 16 and 60, must be nearly 436,000. In order to be more sure of avoiding excess, I will call them only 400,000.</Q> The Doctor proceeds, and upon a moderated calcula∣tion infers that—<HI>the whole number of people will be</HI> 720,000. But supposing that there was this number when the surveys were made, and that the inhabitants double in the time specified, they will be more than four millions in <HI>New-England</HI> in less than 60 years:
<PB N="vi" REF="012406_0007_0F89777730D36F78" MS="y"/>
and in fifty, the Colonists of all <HI>North-America,</HI> what by internal population and settlers from <HI>Europe,</HI> will <HI>probably</HI> be more than double to the <HI>then</HI> inhabitants of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> For it appears from Dr. <HI>Price</HI>'s Supplement, lately published, that <HI>Old-England</HI> and <HI>Wales</HI> are depopulating apace, and that the inhabi∣tants are now <HI>a million and a half</HI> fewer than in the year 1690, see p. 21. He further says, p. 60, <Q>the number of houses in the kingdom (meaning <HI>Eng∣land</HI> and <HI>Wales</HI>) in 1766 was 980,692. Call them however a million, and the number of people in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales</HI> will be four millions and a half, allowing 4 ½ to a house; and five millions al∣lowing five to a house. The former is <HI>probably</HI> too large an allowance; but the latter is <HI>certainly</HI> so. The number of people in the kingdom may, there∣fore, be stated as <HI>probably</HI> not more than four milli∣ons and a half; but <HI>certainly</HI> not five millions.</Q></P>
<P>When the Colonists shall have become thus numerous, and shall so far exceed in people the mother country, they must either be easy and happy, in the secure and confirmed enjoyment of their respective liberties, being closely united in one common cause; or be miserable in object slavery, thro' divisions and cowar∣dice; or be convulsed in dangerous struggles. The period is so nigh, that the parent may look upon his new born infant, as a future actual partaker in the hap∣piness or misery thereof; and must therefore be ani∣mated in exerting his several powers, that so it may be a day of joy and gladness.</P>

<P>THE design being to establish—not a company of a few members, who shall make a particular ad∣vantage, and enrich themselves, by insuring smaller be∣nefits to others; but—a Society, where all shall be joint proprietors, in one common stock formed from their respective contributions; and have equal rights, and receive their full advantage in proportion to their several payments: And as the Society should be large, that so the casualties, by being greatly divided, may the less affect its capital, and the annual contingencies may come the nearer to an equality; and yet not too large, left its good government should be prevented, or the greatness of its stock in a distant period, should induce persons of power, having no right, to interfere in its concerns: And that it may be the more exten∣sively useful, let it be agreed by</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>ARTICLE I.</HEAD>
<P>The Society may consist of, but not more than, two thousand persons; and each to be admitted shall by himself or agent, subscribe one common deed, upon that commence a member, and be bound by the agree∣ments and covenants therein mentioned. The members shall form two classes, the first of which shall compre∣hend
<PB N="2" REF="012406_0009_0F897778AF230828"/>
those who propose securing annuities, after their own decease, to wives or others, in case of survivor∣ship; the second, those who are for purchasing to them∣selves an annuity after a certain age, for the remain∣der of life.</P>
<P>All persons, at admission, should, in point of age, be clear of either extreme, and inhabit within certain li∣mits. Prudence and equity require, that they of the first class should not be exposed, from their residence, calling or manner of life, to peculiar dangers, beyond what belong to mankind in general; and yet, that no objection should arise from serving in the militia, that being the constitutional defence of the whole commu∣nity, and so implying the safety of the smaller socie∣ties. No danger arises to the Society, from any in∣creased hazards to which they of the second class may be exposed; and therefore those, who cannot with safety be admitted into the first, may with advantage be taken into the second. A person admitted into the first class, may be allowed, when not too far advanced in life, to bold also under the second. And therefore let it be</P>

<P>Every person at admission shall not be younger than twenty-one, nor older than sixty years; and shall re∣side within the limits of— [<HI>Here the limits to be speci∣fied, as may be concluded on, after mature deliberation, by the first members.</HI>] No one of the first class shall follow a sea-faring life, or be engaged in the land ser∣vice as an officer, soldier or otherwise, by reason of the superior risk of his employment; but may belong

to, and serve in the militia. One, who cannot be of the first class, on account of his calling and manner of life; or, whom the directors may refuse admitting into it, because of bad health or other threatning circumstan∣ces; may become a member in the second. A person admitted into the first, may at any time, when not too aged, join himself also to the second, subject to the li∣mitation of acting only as a single member, in all the management of the Society's affairs.</P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE III.</HEAD>
<P>Every person, proposing to be a member, shall give in, his name, residence, age, title or profession; and mention whether married or single; if married and in∣tending to secure the benefit of a survivorship to his wife, her age, christian and former name—and where∣ever such benefit is intended, the age, christian and sur∣name, and residence of the party for whom it is designed —to the directors at one of their meetings, and at some subsequent one, shall, if residing within twenty miles, appear personally to be examined by them, as to the state of his health, readiness to conform to and be bound by the rules of the Society, and the like; and upon their having obtained all needful satisfaction, and agreed up∣on his admission, he shall upon paying the stipulated premium become a member, and, upon signing the deed by himself or agent, receive, without any farther charge, a policy setting forth, that he the holder there∣of, in consideration of his complying with the terms therein mentioned, shall himself receive, or secure to
<PB N="4" REF="012406_0011_0F89777A2EFCCF00"/>
another the proposed benefits, in case he shall have liv∣ed one whole calendar year from the time of his ad∣mission, but that otherwise all he may have paid shall be forfeited, and go to the Society's capital. Should the person proposed live at a greater distance than twenty miles, then the directors may be satisfied in a∣ny other way that shall be agreed upon. The policy shall be invalidated where obtained by fraud, deceit, and imposition.</P>
<P>To counteract any partiality by which directors may be induced to reject a proper candidate: to rid the Society of such as may become offensive and scandalous: and to secure it from being burthened with payments, before the natural course of things require them; and from paying improper persons, it may be stipulated by</P>

<P>Any person rejected by the directors may appeal to the Society when assembled at any general meeting, and upon the majority's voting for his admission, he shall be put up again at the next general meeting, and upon then having the votes of the majority shall be forthwith admitted, upon his complying with the usual requirements. Should it happen that a member be∣comes injurious, disgraceful, or obnoxious to the ge∣nerality, the expulsion of such person shall be lawful, provided that the orders for the same be made at a ge∣neral meeting of the society and confirmed at the next successive one, either assembled of course or called on purpose, and at each, by the unanimous consent of all present, or, in case of a division, of three fourths; but

upon such expulsion the party shall receive back all the net principal monies paid by him, upon his peaceably agreeing to surrender up his policy; and on his refu∣sing to do it shall forfeit both. Was the person expelled entitled to, or an actual receiver of, an annuity, in con∣sequence of his having been a member of the second class, the full time required, he shall not be deprived of his annuity, which shall be paid, notwithstanding his expulsion. Should a member become a felon, die or have his death occasioned in or by a duel; or felo∣niously make away with himself; or should he make a voyage exceeding twenty English leagues from port to port, without license first obtained from the directors, and die in such voyage; or should he go beyond the limits agreed upon without a license, and there die; or should he betake himself to a sea-faring life; or en∣gage in the land service, as an officer, soldier or other∣wise; in any such case the benefit of survivorship in∣tended to have been secured to another by his policy shall be forfeited. Should the wife be divorced for a∣dultery, or in any other way have her relation dissol∣ved; or should the receiver of an annuity live in an un∣lawful cohabitation, or be guilty of felony, the right to the annuity shall cease.</P>

the society from being injured by marriages of de∣signing persons in a dying condition, or deceived by any one's pretending to be the widow of such member after his decease, and to ascertain the certainty of the mem∣bers being legally married, be it agreed, that no per∣son claiming as the widow of such member shall be enti∣tled to any annuity, unless such member, whose widow she claims to be, shall, at least three months before his death, have delivered in to the directors, or some one of them, a satisfactory certificate of his marriage with such person, together with her true age; and they shall have approved thereof, and settled for the same. Women way be admitted into either class, under si∣milar restrictions with those already, or hereafter to be mentioned, and be allowed to vote in all the Socie∣ty's affairs either in person or by proxy.</P>
<P>Where the individual intended to be benefited by a future annuity, dies before the time of it's becoming due, the member purchasing the same may possibly think, that, without paying afresh as though newly admitted, he should have a right of substituting another in the place of the deceased, in consequence of what he may have already paid; but as the decease of such persons is one of the chances the society must avail itself of, in order to its paying the proposed annuities where they become due, it is needful that the member should pay afresh, as though newly admitted, on his propo∣sing to secure an annuity to another individual: how∣ever, if he has accomplished, or upon his accomplishing, his probation year, the renewal of that may be dispensed with; he may have the right of continuing a member,
<PB N="7" REF="012406_0014_0F89777D5377FE58" MS="y"/>

<P>Upon the decease of the party, for whom the an∣nuity proposed in the policy was designed, the mem∣ber forfeits the monies paid, to the use of the Socie∣ty; and must settle as a new admitted member, for a∣ny fresh person proposed as a future annuity-receiver, and take out another policy; but, having accomplish∣ed, or upon accomplishing, the probation-year, the re∣newal of that shall be dispensed with: he shall also have the right of continuing a member, and all the net principal monies paid by him, in the intermediate space, between the decease of one individual and his settling for another, shall be discounted in such settle∣ment.</P>
<P>It's essential to the existence of the Society, that the payments should be bothfully and regularly made; but, as experience abundantly proves, that, whatever time is allowed, many will delay performance to the last period, and, if not compelled by a forfeit, exceed; and yet should the time allowed be very short, or the for∣feiture large, there will be a perpetual litigation; and as, after repeated refusal or neglect upon notice given, an absolute exclusion should take place, it may be the purport of</P>

<P>The Society is supposed to be actuated by principles of honesty, honor, and humanity, and to have no de∣sign, of inducing persons to secure advantages to them∣selves or relations, by coming into it at the expence of creditors; or, of obtaining benefits to itself from the misfortunes of its members, therefore let it be</P>

<P>The Doctor calculated on the probabilities of the duration of life, as deduced by Dr. <HI>Halley,</HI> and given in the appendix p. 316.</P>
<P>The purchaser of an annuity, to be enjoyed, after his decease, by another in case of survivorship, being a year upon probation, wherein he hazards all he has advanced, the calculation for the annual payments gives
<PB N="28" REF="012406_0035_0F8973644A3937D0"/>
him some credit for the same, by reckoning as though they began to be made on his commencing a member, instead of a year after.</P>
<P>In calculating the value of the additional 10<HI>l.</HI> the reckoning goes upon nine years instead of ten, as it will be but nine years after the 20<HI>l.</HI> has been secured, be∣fore the right to that addition will be obtained; by this means the purchaser is charged somewhat more than had it went upon ten years; but far less than is allowed for, by reckoning the annual payment as tho' made when he becomes a member. Should it be thought that in justice the calculation should have gone upon ten instead of nine years, it is only deter∣mining that he shall not pay for the additional 10<HI>l.</HI> till he has passed through his probation year; which may be more agreeable than the paying for the whole to∣gether.</P>
<P>The tables suppose that the money is put out im∣mediately, accumulates continually by an uninterrupt∣ed compound interest, is never lost, nor diminished in value; now, as in fact it must often lie by, cannot ac∣cumulate at that rate, and will be subject to a dimi∣nution through losses, failure of interest and the like, it may be most adviseable to reckon upon no more than 4 ½ per cent, certain compound continued interest, and therefore Table II. goes only upon that estimate. They, who are otherwise minded from considering the height of legal interest, may be convinced upon reading the following quotations from Dr. <HI>Price, viz.</HI> p. 8. <Q>In equal ages the mortality of males has been found to be greater than the mortality of females. P. 271, 272, <HI>the greater mortality of males</HI> appears on the whole to be a fact well established. P. 106. The issue of the best schemes of this kind must be in
<PB N="29" REF="012406_0036_0F897364B36370F8"/>
some degree uncertain. For want of proper obser∣vations, it is not possible to determine what allow∣ances ought to be made, on account of the higher probabilities of life among females than males. No prudence can prevent all losses in the improvement of monies; nor can any care guard against the in∣conveniencies to such schemes, which must arise from those persons being most ready to fly to them, who, by reason of concealed disorders, feel them∣selves most likely to want the benefit of them. 'Tis vain to form such establishments with the expecta∣tion of seeing their fate determined soon by experi∣ence. P. 107. No experiments of this sort should be tried hastily. An unsuccessful one must be pro∣ductive of very pernicious effects. All inadequate schemes lay the foundation of <HI>present</HI> relief on <HI>fu∣ture</HI> calamity, and afford assistance to a <HI>few</HI> by dis∣appointing and oppressing <HI>multitudes.</HI> P. 111. Cer∣tainly a Society that means to be a permanent ad∣vantage to the public, ought always to take higher rather than lower values, for the sake of rendering it∣self more secure, and gaining some <HI>profits</HI> to balance <HI>losses</HI> and expences. P. 129. In matters of chance, it is impossible to say, that an unfavourable run of events will not come, which may hurt the best con∣trived scheme. The calculations only determine probabilities; and, agreeably to these, it may be depended on, that events will happen on the whole. But at particular periods, and in particular instances, great deviations will often happen; and these devi∣ations at the commencement of a scheme, must prove either very favourable, or very unfavoura∣ble.</Q></P>
<P>Should a better interest then be made of the mo∣ney
<PB N="30" REF="012406_0037_0F8973657172EF80"/>
than allowed for, the advantages arising from it will tend to give establishment to the Society, securi∣ty against unexpected ills, besides an ample supply for all necessary expences.</P>
<P>'Tis of importance, in calculating annuities, to de∣termine whether the lives of females are <HI>universally</HI> better than those of males; and <HI>how much</HI> better: And his Honour, the Lieutenant Governor, having ve∣ry obligingly communicated to me, some manuscripts containing an account of the number of inhabitants, &amp;c. in <HI>Massachusett's-Bay,</HI> taken by order in 1764, the result was such as induced me at first sight to con∣clude, that in this colony, as in many other places, the lives of females were better than those of males: For it appeared from them, that there were 33438 houses; 41110 families; 59090 white males above 16 years old, and 64755 females, making together 123845; —and that there were 58390 white males under 16, and 55945 females, in all 114335. The whole num∣ber of males and females was 238180. Though the males under 16 exceeded the females by 2445, yet the females above 16 exceeded the males by 5665. The number of towns that sent in accounts was 196: some few declined, or neglected doing it. In 46 of these towns the males above, as well as under 16, exceeded the females. In 47 of them the females exceeded the males under as well as above 16. In 18 of them the males above 16 exceeded the females, and the females under 16 exceeded the males. In the re∣mainder the males under 16 exceeded the females, and the females above 16 exceeded the males. But not∣withstanding this appearance in support of the better lives of females <HI>here</HI> as well as elsewhere, when infor∣mation had been obtained—that the order appeared

mysterious, occasioned an alarm in many places, was disagreeable to multitudes, was not enforced by any penalty, and was not carefully complied with—that different towns purposely took such loose accounts, as should prevent its being known how numerous they were—that it was highly probable that the return of the males was lower than the truth, and that all who were at sea, amounting to some hundreds from vari∣ous ports, were left out of the account—and that the colony had lost full five, if not near ten thousand men by the war immediately preceding—could not but con∣clude, on further thought, that the full number of the white inhabitants was not to be determined from the return, and that the males in the <HI>Massachusett's</HI> were not only more, but better lives, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Since writing the above, have been confirmed in my conclusion, by what Dr. <HI>Price</HI> mentions in his <HI>Supplement,</HI> p. 15, 16, 17. <Q>There is a difference between the mortality of males and females.—I must however observe, that it may be doubted, whether this difference so unfavourable to males, is <HI>natural;</HI> and the following facts will prove, that I have reason for such doubts.</Q></P><Q><P>It appears, from several registers in <HI>Susmilch</HI>'s works, that this difference is much less in the <HI>country parishes</HI> and <HI>villa∣ges</HI> of BRANDENBURGH, than in the <HI>towns.</HI> And, agreeable to this, it appears likewise, from the accounts of the same curious writer, that the number of males in the country comes much nearer to the number of females.</P><P>At the time the accounts were taken of the inhabitants in the province of NEW-JERSEY in AMERICA, they were distinguished particularly into <HI>males</HI> and females under and above sixteen.</P><P>In 1738, the number of <HI>males</HI> under 16 was, 10639; fe∣males. 9700: males above 16—11631; females 10725. In 1745, these numbers were, males under 16—14523; females 13754: males above 16—15087; females 13704.</P><P>The inference is obvious; that human life in males is more brittle than in females, only in consequence of ad∣ventitious causes, or of some particular debility, that takes place in polished and luxurious Societies, and especi∣ally in great towns.</P></Q></NOTE> than those of the fe∣males.
<PB N="32" REF="012406_0039_0F897366F4ACC590"/>
The number of negroes returned, was, males 3020, females 2226; the disproportion between the sexes may be accounted for, upon the far greater im∣port of males. The Indians were 728 males, 953 females; but nothing decisive can be gathered from hence, unless it could be known, whether any, and how many males had perished by the war; whether numbers might not be absent upon hunting, fishing or other engagements, who were not in the account; and what was the disproportion between the sexes, of those that had perished by the excessive drinking of that artificial American poison—Rum. There was no taking the ages of either Negroes or Indians.</P>
<P>Much exactness, and an attention to every circum∣stance, are requisite in communicating accounts, that may be used by other's as a foundation for calcula∣tions; or the whole may be extremely erroneous. Thus Dr. <HI>Price</HI> concludes, p. 198, that, <Q>at <HI>Boston</HI> the inhabitants would decrease were there no sup∣ply from the country; if the account given in the <HI>Gentleman's Magazine</HI> of 1753, p. 413, from 1731 to 1752, of births and burials in the town was just; seeing that the burials all along exceeded the births.</Q> Have examined the <HI>Magazine,</HI> and observe, that it is not an account of <HI>births</HI> and burials, but of <HI>baptisms</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="012406_0040_0F897367B3241E08"/>
and burials—that the number of burials in the time specified was 13384; of <HI>baptisms</HI> 11850;—that the <HI>baptisms</HI> were therefore less than the burials by 1534 —and that in the burials were included 2011 blacks, so that the number of whites buried was only 11<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>73. Now it must be noted, that these accounts of burials and baptisms were most probably taken from the news-papers—that little stress is to be laid upon their authority in this matter, as it's notorious to the mini∣sters, that their lists, especially in the article of bap∣tism, are very imperfect and below the truth, though likely to be much more correct in the other—that great numbers are born, who from various causes are not <HI>baptized</HI>—and that the marriages and births a∣mong the negroes, cannot, by reason of their peculiar circumstances, bear the same proportion with their bu∣rials to those of the inhabitants. Nothing positive concerning the decrease of the inhabitants at <HI>Boston,</HI> can then be concluded upon, from the accounts given in the <HI>Gentleman</HI>'s <HI>Magazine.</HI></P>
<P>Would gentlemen who have time and opportunity communicate by the help of news-papers, or any o∣ther way, the proper intelligence, calculators might be at a much greater certainty; especially, were they to observe the like exactness with what appears in the following letter, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<SALUTE>Messi'rs FLEETS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY one of your late Boston Evening Posts, we had intelligence of a remarkable instance of the shortness of human life; of 100 persons born the same year, one only remained alive the 76th year after. And by far the greater part of them died many years before.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="012406_0041_0F8973687291E088"/>"Be pleased, ther<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>re, on the contrary, to take this account of longevity from the records of the first Church in Rowley; wherein, from September 10, 1682, until January 25, 1691, the space of eight years and nearly five months, there were 246 persons baptized. And February 4, 1771, there were twenty four of them living.</P>
<P>"Now, divide 246 by 24, and you will find that more than one of ten lived to be between 80 and 89 years old.</P>
<P>"Of the said 24, males and females being in number equal, three were baptized Anno 1682, turned there∣fore into their 89th year, four in 84, one in 85, one in 86, two in 87, two in 88, two in 89, eight in 90, and one in 1691. And there being but thirty two baptiz∣ed in 1690, and eight of them living February 1771, shews that one of four baptized that year, have lived to be turned into their 81st year. A rare instance in∣deed!</P>
<P>"And there is a person now living in a neighbouring town, baptized in this, October, 1681, Aet. 91. And there are now living, in the first parish in the town, nine persons between 80 and 90 years of age, and pro∣bably about so many more in the other parts of the town.</P>
<P>"And there have died in the town, the two last years, eleven aged people, including but three of the said 24 (which three died a few months past) one Aet. 81, three 83, one 87, four 88, one 90, one 93.</P>
<P>"It may be added, that there lived in the place now called the first parish in Rowley, four persons, the first of whom died Anno 1716, and the last 1729, and each of the four, by the best accounts that could be had, died an 100 years old and upwards.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="012406_0042_0F8973693291B978"/>"There were but about 220 <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦tween these four, and scarce <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> them unto this time.</P>
<P>"It has been a common remark, that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> New-England do not live so long as in Old. Judge how just an one. You will rarely find in accounts from thence, that more than one of 1000 live to be 100 years old or upwards. Here are four in less than 1000.</P>
