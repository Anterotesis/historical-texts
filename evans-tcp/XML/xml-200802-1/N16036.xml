<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE right education of youth, being a point of great im∣portance to the present and succeeding generations, it is to be regretted, that the want of proper books for the use of schools, should have been so general a subject of complaint; and that very few attempts have been made to supply this deficiency, by introducing something on such a plan, as might, besides improving the understandings and morals, instructively amuse the vacant hours of young people, and have a tendency to ren∣der the task of teaching a more agreeable employment.</P>
<P>WITH a view to these objects, the following Miscellaneous Compilation is now offered to the public. Most of the extracts which compose it, were collected some years ago, from a va∣riety of authors, by a person who had no other intention, at the time, but that of preserving them for her own perusal and amusement; and who, from motives wholly disinterested, has lately, at the request of her friends, consented to their publica∣tion, with a hope, that if they are favourably received, it may prove an incitement to some person of greater abilities, to pur∣sue this or a better plan, whereby our schools may be furnished with a book more deserving their acceptance.</P>
<P>IT gives some concern to the compiler, that she neglected to distinguish the different parts, with the names of their authors, at the time they were selected, as it is not now in her power to supply the omission.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="020526_0003_0FAFE0BF78F4B428"/>THE editor has thought it necessary to remark, that a few verbal alterations have been made in some of the extracts, the better to adapt them to the use of the present design; but as the sentiments and tenor of the original pieces are not thereby materially changed, it is hoped this freedom will be excused by their respective authors, to whom not the least injury or of∣fence has been intended.</P>

<HEAD>A MORNING HYMN.</HEAD>
<L>TO thee, let my first offerings rise,</L>
<L>Whose sun creates the day,</L>
<L>Swift as his glad'ning influence flies,</L>
<L>And spotless as his ray.</L>
<L>What numbers with heart-piercing sighs</L>
<L>Have past this tedious night!</L>
<L>What numbers too have clos'd their eyes,</L>
<L>No more to see the light!</L>
<L>Sound was my sleep, my dreams were gay,</L>
<L>How short such time review'd!</L>
<L>My night stole unperceiv'd away;</L>
<L>I'm like the day renew'd.</L>
<L>This day thy fav'ring hand be nigh,</L>
<L>So oft vouchsaf'd before;</L>
<L>Still may it lead, protect, supply,</L>
<L>And I that hand adore.</L>
<L>If bliss thy Providence impart,</L>
<L>For which resign'd I pray,</L>
<L>Give me to feel the grateful heart,</L>
<L>And without guilt be gay.</L>
<L>Affliction, should thy love intend,</L>
<L>As vice or folly's cure,</L>
<L>Patient to gain that gracious end,</L>
<L>May I the means endure.</L>
<L>Thus from my fix'd or varying fate,</L>
<L>Some virtue let me gain,</L>
<L>That Heaven, nor high, nor low estate,</L>
<L>When sent, may send in vain.</L>
<L>Be this, and ev'ry future day</L>
<L>Still wiser than the past,</L>
<L>That life's improvement to survey</L>
<L>May well sustain my last.</L>

<P>THE duties of religion, sincerely and regularly performed, will always be sufficient to exalt the meanest, and to exercise the highest understanding. That mind will never be vacant, which is frequently recalled by stated duties to meditations on eter∣nal interests; nor can any hour be long, which is spent in obtaining some new qualification for celestial happiness.</P>
<P>TO love an enemy, is the distinguishing characteristic of a religion, which is not of man but of God. It could be de∣livered as a precept, only by him who lived and died to esta∣blish it by his example.</P>
<P>IF thou dost good to man, as an evidence of thy love to God, thy virtue will be exalted from moral to divine; and that hap∣piness, which is the foretaste of paradise, will be thy reward upon earth.</P>
<P>RECREATION after business is allowable; but he that follows his pleasure instead of his business, shall in a little time have no business to follow.</P>

<HEAD>RESIGNATION.</HEAD>
<L>THOU Pow'r Supreme, by whose command I live,</L>
<L>The grateful tribute of my praise receive;</L>
<L>To thy indulgence, I my being owe,</L>
<L>And all the joys which from that being flow.</L>
<L>Scarce eighteen suns have form'd the rolling year,</L>
<L>And run their destin'd courses round the sphere,</L>
<L>Since thou my undistinguish'd form survey'd,</L>
<L>Among the lifeless heaps of matter laid;</L>
<L>Thy skill my elemental clay refin'd,</L>
<L>The straggling parts in beauteous order join'd;</L>
<L>With perfect symmetry compos'd the whole,</L>
<L>And stampt thy sacred image on my soul;</L>
<L>A soul, susceptible of endless joy!</L>
<L>Whose frame, nor force, nor time, can e'er destroy,</L>
<L>But shall subsist, when nature claims my breath,</L>
<L>And bid defiance to the power of death,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="020526_0006_0FAFE0C1BA39F5C8"/>To realms of bliss, with active freedom soar,</L>
<L>And live when earth and hell shall be no more.</L>
<L>Indulgent God, in vain my tongue assays,</L>
<L>For this immortal gift, to speak thy praise.</L>
<L>How shall my heart, its grateful sense reveal,</L>
<L>When all the energy of words must fail?</L>
<L>Oh! may its influence in my life appear,</L>
<L>And every action, prove my thanks sincere.</L>
<L>Grant me, great God! a heart to thee inclin'd,</L>
<L>Increase my faith, and rectify my mind;</L>
<L>Teach me betimes to tread thy sacred ways,</L>
<L>And to thy service consecrate my days;</L>
<L>Still as thro' life's uncertain maze I stray,</L>
<L>Be thou the guiding-star to mark my way;</L>
<L>Conduct the steps of my unguarded youth,</L>
<L>And point their motions to the paths of truth;</L>
<L>Protect me by thy providential care,</L>
<L>And teach my soul t' avoid the tempter's snare;</L>
<L>Thro' all the various scenes of human life,</L>
<L>In calms of ease, or blustering storms of strife,</L>
<L>Thro' every turn of this inconstant state,</L>
<L>Preserve my temper, equal and sedate;</L>
<L>Give me a mind that bravely does despise,</L>
<L>The low designs of artifice and lies;</L>
<L>Be my religion, such as taught by thee,</L>
<L>Alike from pride and superstition free;</L>
<L>Inform my judgment, rectify my will,</L>
<L>Confirm my reason, and my passions still;</L>
<L>To gain thy favour be my only end,</L>
<L>And to that scope may every action tend;</L>
<L>Amidst the pleasures of a prosp'rous state,</L>
<L>Whose flatt'ring charms too oft the mind elate,</L>
<L>Still may I think to whom these joys I owe,</L>
<L>And bless the bounteous hand from whence they flow;</L>
<L>Or if an adverse fortune be my share,</L>
<L>Let not its terrors tempt me to despair,</L>
<L>But bravely arm'd, a steady faith maintain,</L>
<L>And own all best which thy decrees ordain;</L>
<L>On thy Almighty Providence depend,</L>
<L>The best protector and the surest friend:</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="020526_0007_0FAFE0C2850E3468"/>Thus on life's stage may I my part maintain▪</L>
<L>And at my exit thy applauses gain;</L>
<L>When thy pale herald summons me away,</L>

<L>In that last conflict guard me from alarms,</L>
<L>And take my soul, expiring, to thy arms.</L>

<P><Q>BLESSED are the poor in spirit, for their's is the king∣dom of Heaven.</Q>
—Thus our blessed Saviour opened his ser∣mon on the mount; and from his example we may be assured, that humility is the richest garment that the soul can wear. By this word is to be understood, not an abject poorness of spirit, that would stoop to do a mean thing; but such an humble sense of human nature, as sets the heart and affections right towards God, and gives us every temper that is tender and affectionate towards our fellow creatures. This is the soil of all virtues, where every thing that is good and lovely grows.</P>
<P>DESPISE not labour; if you do not want it for food, you may for physic: It strengthens the body, invigorates the mind, and prevents the ill consequences of idleness.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="verse">
<L>OBSERVE the ant, for she instructs the man,</L>
<L>And preaches labour, gath'ring all she can,</L>
<L>Then brings it to increase her heap at home,</L>

<L>And when that comes she creeps abroad no more,</L>
<L>But lies at home and feasts upon her store.</L>

<L>Here all my better faculties confine,</L>
<L>And be this hour of sacred silence thine.</L>
<L>If by the day's illusive scenes misled,</L>
<L>My erring soul from virtue's path has stray'd,</L>
<L>Snar'd by example or by passion warm'd,</L>

<L>And plead my cause by mercy's gentle name—</L>
<L>Mercy, that wipes the penitential tear,</L>
<L>And dissipates the horror of despair;</L>
<L>From rig'rous justice steals the vengeful hour,</L>
<L>Softens the dreadful attribute of pow'r,</L>

<L>Shall every high resolve devotion frames,</L>

<P>PRIDE hides a man's faults from himself, and magnifies them to others.</P>
<P><Q>THERE is nothing (says Plato) so delightful, as the hear∣ing or the speaking of truth.</Q>
For this reason, there is no con∣versation so agreeable, as that of the man of integrity, who hears without any intention to betray, and speaks without any intention to deceive.</P>
<P>Truth is always consistent with itself, and needs nothing to help it out; it is always near at hand, and fits upon our lips, and is ready to drop out before we are aware: Whereas a lie is troublesome, and sets a man's invention on the rack, and one trick needs a great many more of the same kind to make it good.</P>
<P>MORAL virtues themselves, without religion, are but cold, lifeless and insipid: It is religion only which opens the mind to great conceptions, fills it with the most sublime ideas, and warms the soul more than sensual pleasures.</P>
<P>BY reading we enjoy the dead, by conversation, the living, and by contemplation, ourselves. Reading enriches the me∣mory, conversation polishes the wit, and contemplation im∣proves the judgment.</P>
<P>THE commands of Heaven (in the observance of which re∣ligion principally consists) are very plain and obvious to the meanest understanding, and are nothing else but exhortations to love and directions for social happiness.</P>

<L>FRIENDSHIP delights in equal fellowship,</L>
<L>Where purity of rank, and mutual offices,</L>
<L>Engage both sides alike, and keep the balance ev'n.</L>
<L>'Tis irksome to a gen'rous, grateful heart,</L>
<L>To be oppress'd beneath a load of favours,</L>
<L>Still to receive and run in debt with friendship,</L>
<L>Without the power of paying something back.</L>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="prose">
<P>NEVER say any thing directly tending to your own praise: and when you have done or said any thing that deserves it, receive it from others with indifference. Be neither too co∣vetous of it, nor appear displeased or confused at receiving it; but when you have done any thing worthy of praise, suffer yourself to be told of it, without rebuffing those who are doing you justice. In your private thoughts divest yourself of it, and return it to God, as the giver of the gift, and the blesser of the action. Give him unfeigned thanks, for making you an instrument of his glory for the benefit of others.</P>
<P>THE advice of Pythagoras is, that as the body is no more than the servant of the soul, it should only be nourished so as it may best perform an humble and obedient service to it.</P>
<P>THE duties that are owing to friends, are integrity, love, counsel and assistance. It is not intimacy and frequency of conversation, that makes a friend, but a disinterested ob∣servance of these duties.</P>
<P>THERE is no manner of life so strait, or miserable, that hath not some solace and consolation. Jonah had leisure to make his prayer unto God, even in the belly of the whale, and was heard.</P>
<P>IT is some short refreshment to friends and relations, to see and hear from one another, but it passeth away; and we have here no continuing city, no abiding delights in this world; our rest remains elsewhere. Those we have, lose much of their sweetness, from the thoughts of parting with them, even while we enjoy them; but the happiness to come is eternal.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="020526_0012_0FAFE0C6DD4F4BC0"/>BE very careful in your promises, and just in your perform∣ances, and remember it is better to do, and not promise, than to promise, and not perform.</P>

<P>DEATH seems to enter a cottage only as a gentle de∣liverer from the miseries of human life; but into courts and the seats of grandeur, with insult and terror. To languish under a gilded canopy, to expire on soft and downy pillows, and give up the ghost in state, has a more gloomy aspect, than at the call of nature, to expire on a grassy turf, and resign the breathless clay, back to its proper element. What does a crowd of friends or flatterers signify in that important hour, to the most glorious mortal? Which of his numerous attendants would stand the arrest of death, descend into the silent prison of the grave for him, or answer the summons of the supreme tribunal?</P>
<P>BEAUTY is a short-lived flower, which is easily withered: A cultivated mind is a treasure, which encreases every moment; it is a rich soil, which brings forth an hundred fold.</P>
<P>A PERSON never appears so ridiculous by the quali∣ties he has, as by those he affects to have. He gains more by being contented to be seen as he is, than by attempting to appear what he is not.</P>
<P>TRUE greatness of soul pays itself, as it were, with its own hands, by the satisfaction of doing good.</P>
<P>PEOPLE may talk like good Christians at their ease; but pretty sentences, and formal speeches, are very trifling reme∣dies to a real and unaffected sorrow.</P>

<P>A MIND formed upon the principles of the gospel, may look down with contempt upon the lustre of a throne, and yet know the value, and feel a sense of gratitude, in the possession of a crumb. The most exalted situation in the present life is exposed; yea, probably most exposed, to the fascinating al∣lurements of temptation; and whosoever shall look heedfully upon those who are eminent for their riches, will not think their condition such as that he should hazard his quiet, and much less his virtue, to obtain it. The rich and the poor have their hours of sorrow, and their intervals of joy; neither poverty nor wealth exempt them from feeling the common calamities of life, nor confer that happiness we so eagerly pursue, but which we must not experience, till our race is finished, and our work done.</P>

<P>INDUSTRY is needful in every condition of life; we cannot, without it, act in any state to the benefit or satisfaction of others, or to our own advantage and comfort; it is requisite for procuring ease and satisfaction to the mind; and if attended with a good conscience, sweetens our enjoyments, and seasons our attainments; and is a guard to innocence, and a bar to temptation.</P>
<P>A PERSON under the influence and temper of the gospel, will say with gratitude and joy, "I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content." In the most trying circumstances, I have a sure and certain promise, that my bread shall be given, and my water shall be sure; and if I am not favoured with all the elegancies of life, yet I am confident that the God whom I serve, will afford me such temporary supplies, as shall be most conducive to my own happiness and his glory.</P>
<P>TRUE religion will shew its influence in every part of our conduct; it is like the sap of a living tree, which pene∣trates to the most distant boughs.</P>
<P>ACTION keeps the soul in constant health, but idleness corrupts and rusts the mind; for a man of great abilities may by negligence and idleness become so useless as to be an in∣cumbrance to society and a burthen to himself.</P>
<P>HE is the most worthy of possessing riches, who knows best how to do without them.</P>

She died as she lived, well; and blest in the greatest extremity; most patiently sending forth her pure soul with many zealous prayers and hymns to her Maker; pour∣ing out her affectionate heart in passionate streams to her Sa∣viour.—</P>

<P>IN the works of man, perfection is aimed at, but it can only be found in those of the Creator.</P>
<P>CONSCIENCE is the law of the all-wise author of na∣ture, written on our hearts, or properly the application of this law, as it regards the judgments we should form of particular actions.—It is like a censor noting and observing our actions, and therefore it has not undeservedly been called by some a por∣tion of the virgin soul, as not admitting the least blemish of prevarication. Hence good actions beget security in the con∣science, but bad cause anguish and vexation, which is better known by experience than explained by words: For, if it is painful to us to abide by the judgments of those we live with, and to put up with their reprehensions, it will be more so to be condemned by our own reason, and to carry about us so se∣vere a judge of our actions. And thus it is, that conscience performs the function both of a witness and judge, when it re∣primands us for having done amiss, as Juvenal says—
<Q><LG>

<P>TO keep the passions of others submissive, there is a neces∣sity of triumphing over one's own; to oblige them to be vir∣tuous, one must set the example and be the model: There is not a better lesson than that, which a superior makes it his duty to practise.</P>
<P>THERE is so great a grace and authority in virtue, that it never fails to attract the esteem even of those that are most abandoned to vice and immorality; so that religion, by its own authority, and the reasonable force of it, is sufficent to establish its empire in the mind of any thinking person.</P>
<P>LET your expectations be higher than any dignity or en∣joyment this world can boast. Let a celestial crown fire your ambition; and in the pursuit of infinite happiness, grasp at no∣thing below the glories of immortality. With what a divine ambition does the prospect of Heavenly joys inspire the soul. If you are reckoned by any of the gay and giddy world the less polite for entertaining such exalted thoughts of pleasure, be content in being unfashionably good, since thereby you can keep your peace; be fearless and open to the inspection of Heaven; justify yourself to your own conscience, and secure the divine interest. Be always assured, that no character is more amiable than that of a female, who in the gayest bloom

<P>IN all things preserve integrity; the consciousness of thy own uprightness will alleviate the toil of business, and soften the harshness of ill success and disappointments, and give thee an humble confidence before God, when the ingratitude of man, or the iniquity of the times, may rob thee of other due reward.</P>
<P>THE time of sickness or affliction is like the cool of the day was to Adam, a season of peculiar propriety for the voice of God to be heard; and may be improved into a very advanta∣geous opportunity of begetting or encreasing spiritual life in the soul.</P>

<P>A WISE Heathen, with great justice, compares prosperity to the indulgence of a fond mother to her child, which often proves his ruin; but the affection of the Divine Being to that of a wise father, who would have his sons exercised with labour, disappointment and pains, that they may gather strength and improve their fortitude. Sometimes too, a misfortune may happen to a good man, to preserve him from a much greater one. Thus sickness may be a very great mercy to him, if it keeps him from embarking in a vessel which will be lost in its passage. Thus poverty may screen him from a great many evils which would be brought upon him by riches, and the like. We are so short-sighted, that we know not how to dis∣tinguish, and often take the greatest blessings for misfortunes, and the heaviest curses for blessings. We are like mariners, who by fair winds might run into the way of pirates; but by those contrary to their wishes, reach their port in safety.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="prose">
<P>A RICH man is no way happier than another man, but that he hath more opportunities ministered unto him of doing more good than his neighbour.</P>
<P>HUMILITY is the grand virtue that leads to content∣ment; it cuts off the envy and malice of inferiors and equals, and makes us patiently bear the insults of superiors.</P>
<P>POVERTY has not always the nature of an affliction or judgment, but is rather merely a state of life appointed by providence for the proper trial and exercise of the virtues of contentment, patience and resignation: And for one man to murmur against God because he possesses not those riches he sees given to another,
<Q>is the wrath that killeth the foolish man, and the envy that slayeth the silly one.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="020526_0062_0FAFE0EDFB06CB48"/>SURELY if we did not lose our remembrance, or at least our sensibility, that view would always predominate in our lives, which alone can afford us comfort when we die.</P>
<P>A Serious and contemplative mind sees God in every thing. Every object we behold, the food by which we are sustained, the raiment wherewith we are cloathed, suggest thoughts of piety and gratitude; and if we attend to the silent voice of meditation, we shall
<Q><L>"Find tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,</L>
<L>"Sermons in stones, and good in every thing."</L></Q></P>
<P>OUR principles only become pleasing and delightful, when by the influence of them we learn to calm and govern our passions; and are formed by them into such a temper, as renders us capable of cheerfully enjoying the blessings of the present world, and the higher happiness of a better.</P>
<P>THE most momentous concern of man, is the state he shall enter upon, after this short and transitory life is ended: And in proportion as eternity is of greater importance than time, so ought men to be solicitous upon what grounds their ex∣pectations, with regard to that durable state, are built; and upon what assurances their hopes or their fears stand.</P>
<P>WE should take all the care imaginable, how we create enemies, it being one of the hardest things in the Christian religion, to behave ourselves as we ought to do towards them.</P>

From this we may collect, that an old friend is always to be most valued, the best to be loved, and the first to be trusted.</P>

<P>FORTITUDE has its extremes, as well as the rest of the virtues; and ought, like them, to be always attended by prudence.</P>
<P>THE end of learning is, to know God, and out of that knowledge, to love him, and to imitate him, as we may the nearest, by possessing our souls of true virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="020526_0074_0FAFE0F6F8FAC2F0"/>CICERO says,
<Q>Vicious habits are so great a stain to human nature, and so odious in themselves, that every person actuated by right reason, would avoid them, though he was sure they would be always concealed both from God and man, and had no future punishment entailed upon them.</Q></P>
<P>AS to be perfectly just, is an atribute of the divine nature; to be so to the utmost of our abilities, is the glory of a man.</P>
<P>A VIRTUOUS habit of mind is so absolutely necessary to influence the whole life, and beautify every particular action; to overbalance or repel all the gilded charms of avarice, pride, and self-interest, that a man deservedly procures the lasting epi∣thets of good or bad, as he appears either swayed by, or re∣gardless of it.</P>
<P>A MAN of virtue is an honour to his country, a glory to humanity, a satisfaction to himself, and a benefactor to the world. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is rich without oppression or dishonesty, charita∣ble without ostentation, courteous without deceit, and brave without vice.</P>
<P>ANGER may glance into the breast of a wise man, but rests only in the bosom of fools.</P>
<P>WHEN the last hour seems to be approaching, all terres∣trial advantages are viewed with indifference; and the value that we once set upon them, is disregarded or forgotten. And if the same thought was always predominant, we should then find the absurdity of stretching out our arms incessantly to grasp that which we cannot keep; and wearing out ourselves in endeavours to add new turrets to the fabric of ambition, when the foundation itself is shaking, and the ground on which it stands is mouldering away.</P>
<P>TO him who is animated with a view of obtaining appro∣bation from the Sovereign of the universe, no difficulty should seem insurmountable.</P>

<P>IT is our business to follow the leadings of Divine Provi∣dence, as the best and wisest rule for our conduct in every stage and circumstance of life.

<P>WHY are we commanded to pray, "Give us this day our daily bread," if not to teach us, among other things, our daily dependence upon God as the dispenser of all our temporal blessings? Our various wants return with the morning; and to whom should we look, but to him who is able to supply them?

<P>A WISE man endeavours to shine in himself; a fool to outshine others.

<P>TRUE philosophy, says Plato, consists more in fidelity, constancy, justice, sincerity, and in the love of our duty, than in a great capacity.</P>
<P>THE best people need afflictions for trial of their virtue. How can we exercise the grace of contentment, if all things succeed well? Or that of forgiveness, if we have no enemies?</P>

<P>WHAT, oh! my heart, overflowing with happiness! are the sentiments that ought to spring up in thee, when admit∣ted, either in the solemnities of public worship, or the retired∣ness of private devotion, into the more immediate presence of thy Maker—who does not govern, but to bless! whose divine commands are sent to succour human reason in search of hap∣piness!

Let thy law, Almighty! be the rule, and thy glory the constant end, of all I do. Let me not build virtue on any notions of honour, but of honour to thy name. Let me not sink piety in the boast of benevolence; my love of God in the love of my fellow-creatures. Can good be of human growth! No—it is thy gift, Almighty, and All-good! Let not thy bounties remove the donor from my thought; nor the love of pleasures make me forsake the fountain from which they flow. When joys entice, let me ask their title to my heart: When evils threaten, let me see thy mercy shining through the cloud, and discern the great hazard of having all to my wish. In an age of such licentiousness, let me not take comfort from the number of those who do amiss; an omen rather of public ruin, than of private safety. Let the joys of the multitude less allure than alarm me; and their danger, not example, determine my choice. In this day of domineering pleasures, so lower my taste as to make me relish the comforts of life. And in this day of dissipation, O give me thought sufficient to preserve me from being so desperate, as in this per∣petual flux of things, and as perpetual swarm of accidents, to depend on to-morrow; a dependence that is the ruin of to∣day, as that is of eternity. Let my whole existence be ever before me, nor let the terrors of the grave turn back my sur∣vey. When temptations arise, and virtue staggers, let imagi∣nation sound the final trumpet, and judgment lay hold on eter∣nal life. In what is well begun, grant me to persevere, and to know, that none are wise, but they who determine to be wiser still. And since, O Lord! the fear of thee is the beginning of wisdom, and, in its progress, its secret shield, turn the world entirely out of my heart, and place that guardian angel, thy blessed fear, in its stead. Turn out a foolish world, which gives its money for what is not bread; which hews out broken cis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erns, that hold no water; a world, in which even they, whose hands are mighty, have found no∣thing. There is nothing, Lord God Almighty! in Heaven, in earth, but thee—I will seek thy face; bless thy name; sing thy praises; love thy law; do thy will; enjoy thy peace; hope thy glory, till my final hour! Thus shall I grasp all that can be grasped by man. This will heighten good, and soften evil, in the present life, and when death summons, I shall

So that those who make great progress in human sciences, for the most part become peremptory and decisive: On the contrary, the proficients in the science of God become more reserved, more inclind to silence, less addicted to their own sense, and less venturesome to judge of others, because they discover more and more how uncertain and obscure our knowledge is; how much we often deceive ourselves in the things we think we know best; how many faults and errors we run into by haste and precipitation in judging; and what disorders are often caused by rash judgments and advices.</P>

<P>MANY scripture parables and similitudes are taken from the common actions of this life, that when our hands are em∣ployed about them, our hearts may the more easily pass thro' them to divine and heavenly things.</P>
<P>EVERY thing is beautiful in its season; and it is the wisdom of the prudent, so to order the duties of their general callings as Christians, and those of their particular callings in the world, as that they may not clash or interfere.</P>
<P>IT is related of the pious Philip Henry, that if any asked his charity, whose representation of their case he did not like, or who he thought did amiss to take that course, he would first give them an alms, and then mildly reprove them; labouring to convince them that they were out of the way of duty; that they could not expect God should bless them in it, and would not chide, but reason with them. He would say, if he should tell them of their faults, and not give them an alms, the reproof would look only like an excuse to deny his charity, and would be rejected accordingly.</P>
<P>TO be over solicitous after praise, to be greedy of it, and eager in pursuing it, and to seem in some measure to beg it, in∣stead of being the character of a great soul, is the most certain sign of a vain and light disposition, which feeds upon the wind, and takes the shadow for the substance.</P>

<P>MEEKNESS may be called the pioneer of all the other virtues, which levels every obstruction, and smooths every dif∣ficulty, that might impede their entrance, or retard their pro∣gress.</P>
<P>IF it were only for mere human reasons, it would turn to a better account, to be patient; nothing defeats the malice of an enemy, like a spirit of forbearance; the return of rage for rage cannot be so effectually provoking. True gentleness, like an impenetrable armour, repels the most pointed shafts of malice; they cannot pierce thro' this invulnerable shield, but either fall hurtless to the ground, or return to wound the hand that shot them</P>
<P>A MEEK spirit will not look out of itself for happiness, because it finds a constant banquet at home; yet by a sort of Di∣vine Alchymy, it will convert all external events to its own profit, and be able to deduce some good, even from the most unpromising; it will extract comfort and satisfaction from the most barren circumstances; "it will suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock."</P>
<P>HONOURS and dignities are transient, beauty and riches frail and fleeting, to a proverb. Would not the truly
<PB N="141" REF="020526_0140_0FAFE552463E3888"/>
wise, therefore, wish to have some one possession, which they might call their own in the severest exigencies? But this wish can only be accomplished, by acquiring, and maintaining, that calm and absolute self-possession, which as the world had no hand in giving, so it cannot, by the most malicious exerti∣on of its power, take away.</P>
<P>AN amiable and wise woman will, always have something better to value herself on than outward advantages, which, however captivating, are still but subordinate parts of a truly excellent character.</P>
<P>HOW cruel is it to exti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ish, by neglect or unkindness, the precious sensibility of an open temper, to chill the amiable glow of an ingenious soul, and to quench the bright flame of a noble and generous spirit! These are of higher worth, than all the documents of learning; of dearer price, than all the ad∣vantages which can be derived from the most refined and artifi∣cial mode of education.</P>
<P>THE best of men, and the best of books, can do us good, only so far as they turn us from themselves, and every human comfort, to seek and receive every kind of good, from God alone.</P>
<P>TO desire to communicate good to every creature, in the degree we can, and it is capable of receiving from us, is a di∣vine temper; for thus God stands unchangeably disposed to∣wards the whole creation.</P>

<HEAD>ACCEPTABLE SACRIFICE.</HEAD>
<P>HE that keepeth the law, bringeth offerings enough: He that taketh heed to the commandment, offereth a peace-offering: He that requiteth a good turn offereth fine flour: And he that giveth alms, sacrificeth praise. To depart from wickedness, is a thing pleasing to the Lord; and to forsake unrighteousness, is a propitiation. Thou shalt not appear empty before the Lord; for all these things are to be done, because of the com∣mandment. The offering of the righteous maketh the altar fat, and the sweet savour thereof is before the Most High! The sacrifice of a just man is acceptable, and the memorial thereof shall never be forgotten. Eccles. xxxv.</P>
<P>WE see almost every day, the unexpected death of our friends and our enemies; we see new graves often opened for men older and younger than ourselves; for the cautious and the careless, the dissolute and the temperate; for men, who like us, were providing to enjoy or improve hours now irreversibly cut off; we see all this, and yet, instead of living, let year glide after year, in preparations to live.</P>
<P>A MAN that fasteth for his sins, and goeth again and do∣eth the same, who will hear his prayer? or what doth his hum∣bling profit him. Eccles. xxxiv.26.</P>
<P>THE mind is never so sensibly disposed to pity the suffer∣ings of others, as when it is itself subdued and softened by ca∣lamity. Adversity diffuses a kind of sacred calm over the breast, that is the parent of thoughtfulness and meditation.</P>
<P>HE that looks upon the business and bustle of the world, with the philosophy with which Socrates surveyed the fair at Athens, will turn away at last with his exclamation, "how many things are here which I do not want."</P>
<P>WHILE affliction prepares us for felicity, we may con∣sole ourselves under its pressures, by remembering, that they are no particular marks of divine displeasure, since all the dis∣tresses of persecution have been suffered by those, "of whom the world was not worthy;" and the Redeemer of mankind himself was "a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief."</P>

<P>IT is a certain sign of an ill heart, to be inclined to defa∣mation. They who are harmless and innocent, can have no gratification that way; but it ever arises from a neglect of what is laudable in a man's self, and an impatience of seeing it in another.</P>
<P>TO forbear replying to an unjust reproach, and overlook it, with a generous, or (if possible) with an entire neglect of it, is one of the most heroic acts of a great mind.</P>
<P>EVERY appearance of amiable simplicity, or of honest shame, nature's hasty conscience, will be dear to sensible hearts; they will carefully cherish every such indication in a young fe∣male; for they will perceive, that it is this temper, wisely culti∣vated, which will one day make her enamoured of the loveliness of virtue and the beauty of holiness; from which she will ac∣quire a taste for the doctrines of religion, and a spirit to perform the duties of it.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="020526_0145_0FAFE557810DC298"/>THE hypocrisy of assuming virtues, which are not inhe∣rent in the heart, prevents the growth and disclosure of those real ones, which it is the great end of education to cultivate.</P>
<P>GOOD dispositions, of themselves, will go but a very little way, unless they are confirmed into good principles. And this cannot be effected, but by a careful course of religious in∣struction, and a patient and laborious cultivation of the moral temper.</P>
<P>IN the great and universal concern of religion, both sexes, and all ranks, are equally interested. The truly catholic spirit of Christianity accommodates itself, with an astonishing con∣descension, to the circumstances of the whole human race.</P>
<P>LET no mistaken girl fancy she gives a proof of her wit, by her want of piety; or that a contempt of things serious and sacred, will exalt her understanding, or raise her character, even in the opinion of the most avowed male infidels.</P>
<P>CICERO spoke it as the highest commendation of Cato's character, that he embraced philosophy, not for the sake of disputing like a philosopher, but of living like one. The chief purpose of Christian knowledge, is to promote the great end of a Christian life.</P>

<P>"IF thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink." That is, if we behold our enemy labouring under any extraordinary distress or calamity, which it is in our power to re∣move, or alleviate, as in the case of extreme poverty, sickness, or misfortune, we ought then cheerfully to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end him our help and assistance, to extricate him out of his difficulties or afflic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ons. An amiable example of which our Saviour affords us in the parable of the good Samaritan, who had a much better rea∣son for neglecting the distressed traveller, than either the priest, or the Levite, viz. Because he was a Jew, and therefore his de∣clared enemy. But in him all party-animosities were overpow∣ered by the tender feelings of pity and compassion.</P>
<P>SELFISHNESS may indifferently happen to be a mo∣tive to an action, that, in itself, is either good or evil, either
<PB N="149" REF="020526_0148_0FAFE559C611CD70"/>
hurtful or beneficent. But, as far as selfishness, merely, is a motive to any action, it never had, nor can have, any relation to virtue. We must search somewhat deeper for the root of that tree, which is productive of this divine fruit.</P>
<P>ALL who would please the great, must be flatterers; but the true province of friendship is, to put us in mind of our own faults.</P>
<P>MEEKNESS makes any condition tolerable and easy to be endured. He that meekly bears any suffering, takes off the edge of it, that it cannot wound him; whereas he that frets and rages at it, whets it, and makes it much sharper than it would otherwise be.</P>
<P>IT is said of our blessed Saviour, that "he was led as a sheep to the slaughter; that when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, threatened not." And if he, the Lord of glory, suffered thus meekly and unjustly from his own crea∣tures, with what face can we ever complain of any injury done to us?</P>
<P>BE very watchful over thine heart, and never suffer it to seed on the fancy of thy own worth; but whenever any such thought arises, beat it down immediately, with the remem∣brance of some of thy follies or sins, and so make this very mo∣tion of pride an occasion of humility.</P>
<P>NEVER compare thyself with those thou thinkest more foolish or more wicked, that so thou mayest, like the Phari∣see, extol thyself for being better; but if thou wilt compare, do it with the wise and godly; and then thou wilt find thou comest so far short, as may help to pull down thy high esteem of thyself.</P>
<P>POVERTY is apt to betray a man into envy, riches into arrogance; poverty is too often attended with fraud, vicious compliance, repining, murmur and discontent.

<L>WHAT happiness the rural maid attends,</L>
<L>In chearful labour while each day she spends;</L>
<L>She gratefully receives what Heaven has sent,</L>
<L>And, rich in poverty, enjoys content.</L>
<L>She seldom feels the spleen's imagin'd pains,</L>
<L>Nor melancholy stagnates in her veins;</L>
<L>She rarely loses life in thoughtless ease,</L>
<L>Nor on the velvet couch invites disease.</L>
<L>Her homespun dress in simple neatness lies,</L>
<L>And for no glaring equipage she sighs.</L>
<L>Her reputation, which is all her boast,</L>
<L>In a malicious visit ne'er was lost.</L>
<L>No midnight masquerade her beauty wears,</L>
<L>And health, not paint, the fading bloom repairs.</L>
<L>If love and quiet in her bosom reign,</L>
<L>And like enjoyment in her happy swain,</L>
<L>No homebred jars her quiet state controul,</L>
<L>Nor watchful jealousy torments her soul.</L>
<L>With secret joy she sees her little race</L>
<L>Rest on her knee, and her small cottage grace;</L>
<L>The fleecy ball their busy fingers cull,</L>
<L>Or from the spindle draw the length'ning wool;</L>
<L>Thus flow her hours, with constant peace of mind,</L>
<L>Till age the latest thread of life unwind.</L>

<L>OF all those sorrows that attend mankind,</L>
<L>With patience bear the lot to thee assign'd,</L>
<L>Nor think it chance, nor murmur at the load,</L>
<L>For know what man calls fortune, is from God.</L>

<P>AMONG the antient Romans, it was not the house which honoured the master, but the master the house. A cottage with them became as august as a temple, when justice, gene∣rosity, probity, sincerity, and honour, were lodged in it; and how can a house be called small, which contains so many and such great virtues?</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="020526_0153_0FAFE55D8162CC20"/>AN extraordinary merit may lie hid under a mean habit, as a rich garment may cover enormous vices.</P>
<P>THE nobility arising from birth, is by far inferior to that which proceeds from merit.</P>
<P>MARCUS Aurelius was averse to every thing that had the air of pomp and luxury. He lay upon the bare ground; at twelve years old he took the habit of a Philosopher; he forbore the use of guards, the imperial ornaments, and the en∣signs of honour, which were carried before the Caesars and the Augusti. Nor was this conduct owing to his ignorance of what was grand and beautiful, but to the juster and purer taste he had of both, and to an intimate persuasion, that the greatest glory, and principal duty of man, especially if in power, and eminently conspicuous, is so far to imitate the Deity, as to throw himself into a condition of wanting as little as may be for himself, and doing all the good to others he is capable of.</P>
<P>IF it shews a greatness of soul to overlook our own nobility, and not suffer it to gain the ascendant over our actions, we may likewise observe, that it is no less great in such as have raised themselves by merit, not to forget the meanness of their extraction, nor be ashamed of it.</P>
<P>WE read in the scriptures, that Boaz, in the midst of riches, was laborious, diligent in husbandry, plain without luxury, delicacy, sloth or pride. How affable, how obliging and kind to his servants! "The Lord be with you," says he to his reapers; and they answered him, "the Lord bless thee." This was the beautiful language of religious antiquity; but how little known in our days.</P>
<P>How commendable was his behaviour towards Ruth, when he desires her not to go into any other field to glean, but to abide fast by his maidens, to eat and drink with them, and the charitable order he gives his reapers to let her glean even among the sheaves, and to let fall some of the handfuls on purpose for her that she might gather them up without being ashamed; teaching us by this wise conduct, to save those we oblige, the confusion of receiving, and ourselves the tempta∣tion of vain-glory in giving.</P>

<P>PROSPERITY quickens, and gives a sort of false cou∣rage to men of low, degenerate minds, and dresses them up in an outward grandeur, which imposes upon the majority of mankind; but adversity is the touchstone of souls truly great and generous.</P>
<P>SILENCE is sometimes more significant and sublime, than the most noble and most expressive eloquence, and is, on many occasions, the indication of a great mind.</P>
<P>But silence never shows itself to so great an advantage, as when it is made the reply to calumny and defamation, pro∣vided that we give no just occasion for them.</P>
<P>HOW different is the view of past life, in the man who is grown old in knowledge and wisdom, from that of him who
<PB N="158" REF="020526_0157_0FAFE562029CEA30"/>
is grown old in ignorance and folly. The latter is like the owner of a barren country, that fills his eye with the prospect of naked hills and plains, which produce nothing either pro∣fitable or ornamental; the other beholds a beautiful and spaci∣ous landscape, divided into delightful gardens, green meadows, fruitful fields, and can scarce cast his eye on a single spot of his possessions, that is not covered with some beautiful plant or flower.</P>
<P>TO look upon the soul as going on from strength to strength, to consider that she is to shine forever with new accessions of glory, and brighten to all eternity; that she will be still add∣ing virtue to virtue, and knowledge to knowledge, carries in it something wonderfully agreeable to that ambition, which is natural to the mind of man. Nay, it must be a prospect plea∣sing to God himself, to see his creation forever beautifying in his eyes, and drawing nearer to him, by greater degrees of re∣semblance.</P>
<P>THAT we might not want inducements to engage us in such an exercise of the body, as is proper for its welfare, it is so ordered, that nothing valuable can be procured without it. Not to mention riches and honour, even food and raiment are not to be come at without the toil of the hands, and sweat of the brows. Providence furnishes materials, but expects that we should work them up ourselves.</P>
<P>As for those who are not obliged to labour, by the condi∣tion in which they are born, they are more miserable than the rest of mankind, unless they indulge themselves in that volun∣tary labour, which goes by the name of exercise.</P>

<P>IF we are firmly resolved to live up to the dictates of rea∣son, without any regard to wealth, reputation, or the like con∣siderations, any more than as they fall in with our principal design, we may go through life with steadiness and pleasure; but if we act by several broken views, and will not only be virtuous, but wealthy, popular, and every thing that has a value set upon it by the world, we shall live and die in misery and repentance.</P>
<P>ENQUIRIES after happiness, and rules for attaining it, are not so necessary and useful to mankind, as the arts of con∣solation, and supporting one's self under affliction. The utmost we can hope for, in this world, is contentment; if we aim at any thing higher, we shall meet with nothing but grief and

disappointments. A man should direct all his studies and en∣deavours, at making himself easy now, and happy hereafter.</P>
<P>IT is of the last importance to season the passions of a child with devotion, which seldom dies in a mind that has received an early tincture of it. Tho' it may seem extinguished for a while by the cares of the world, the heats of youth, or the al∣lurements of vice, it generally breaks out, and discovers itself again as soon as discretion, consideration, age, or misfortunes, have brought the man to himself. The fire may be covered and overlaid, but cannot be entirely quenched and smothered.</P>
<P>PURE devotion opens the mind to great conceptions, and fills it with more sublime ideas, than any that are to be met with in the most exalted science; and at the same time warms and agitates the soul more than sensual pleasure.</P>
<P>IT is of unspeakable advantage to possess our minds with an habitual good intention, and to aim all our thoughts, words and actions, at the same laudable end, the glory of our Maker, the good of mankind, and the benefit of our own souls.</P>
<P>SOCRATES, on the day of his execution, a little be∣fore the draught of poison was brought to him, entertaining his friends with a discourse on the immortality of the soul, has these words: "Whether or no God will approve of my actions, I know not; but this I am sure of, that I have at all times made it my endeavour to please him; and I have a good hope, that this my endeavour will be accepted by him."</P>

<P>THERE is such a thing as converse with God in prayer, and it is the life and pleasure of a pious soul; without it we are no Christians, and he that practises it most, is the best follower of Christ; for our Lord spent much time in converse with his Heavenly Father.

<P>TO piety join modesty and docility, reverence of your pa∣rents, and submission to those who are your superiors in know∣ledge, in station, and in years. Dependence and obedience belong to youth. Modesty is one of its chief ornaments; and has ever been esteemed a presage of rising merit.</P>
<P>PROVIDENCE never intended, that any state here should be either completely happy, or entirely miserable. If the feelings of pleasure are more numerous, and more lively, in the higher departments of life, such also are those of pain. If greatness flatters our vanity, it multiplies our dangers. If opulence encreases our gratifications, it encreases, in the same proportion, our desires and demands. If the poor are confined to a more narrow circle, yet, within that circle, lie most of those natural satisfactions, which, after all the refinements of art, are found to be the most genuine and true.</P>

and the highest prosperity will prove only disguised misery. Fix then this conclusion in your mind, that the destruction of your virtue, is the destruction of your peace. "For our re∣joicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simpli∣city, and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-wards." 2 Cor. i.12.</P>

<P>SINCERITY is firm and substantial, and there is no∣thing hollow or unsound in it; and because it is plain and open, fears no discovery; of which the crafty man is always in dan∣ger.</P>
<P>PLUTARCH has written an essay on the benefits which a man may receive from his enemies; and mentions this in particular, "that, by the reproaches cast upon us we see the worst side of ourselves, and open our eyes to several blemishes and defects in our lives and conversations, which we should not have observed without the help of such ill-natured monitors."</P>
<P>LET us "keep the heart with all diligence, seeing out of it are the issues of life." Let us account our mind the most im∣portant province which is committed to our care; and as we cannot rule events, study at least to rule ourselves.</P>
<P>IT is too common with the young, even when they resolve to tread the path of virtue and honour, to set out with presump∣tuous confidence in themselves. Trusting to their own abilities, for carrying them successfully through life, they are careless of applying to God, or of deriving any assistance from what they are apt to reckon the gloomy discipline of religion. Alas! how little do they know the dangers which await them?"</P>
<P>Neither human wisdom, nor human virtue, unsupport∣ed by religion, are equal for the trying situations which
<PB N="175" REF="020526_0174_0FAFE571069D7370"/>
often occur in life. By the shock of temptation, how fre∣quently have the most virtuous intentions been overthrown! Under the pressure of disaster, how often has the greatest con∣stancy sunk! Destitute of the favour of God, you are in no bet∣ter situation, with all your boasted abilities, than orphans left to wander in a trackless desart, without any guide to conduct them, or any shelter to cover them from the gathering storm. Correct, then, this ill-founded arrogance. Expect not that your happiness can be independent of him who made you. By faith and repentance, apply to the Redeemer of the world. By piety and prayer, seek the protection of the God of Hea∣ven.</P>
<P>THE cheerfulness of a well-regulated mind, springs from a good conscience, and the favour of Heaven, and is bounded by temperance and reason. It makes a man happy in himself, and promotes the happiness of all around him. It is the clear and calm sunshine of a mind illuminated by piety and virtue. It crowns all other good dispositions, and comprehends the ge∣neral effect which they ought to produce on the heart.</P>
<P>LET no man rashly determine, that his unwillingness to be pleased, is a proof of understanding, unless his superiority appears from a less doubtful evidence; for though peevishness may sometimes boast its descent from learning or from wit, it is much oftener of base extraction, the child of vanity and nursling of ignorance.</P>
<P>LET the virtuous remember, amidst all their sufferings, that though the heart of the good man may bleed, even to death, he will never feel a torment equal to the rendings of remorse.</P>
<P>PLATO being told, that he had many enemies who spoke ill of him, "It is no matter, said he, I will live so that none shall believe them." Hearing, at another time, that an inti∣mate friend of his had spoken detractingly of him, "I am sure he would not do it, says he, if he had not some reason for it." This is the surest, as well as the noblest way, of drawing the sting out of a reproach, and the true method of preparing a
<PB N="176" REF="020526_0175_0FAFE571C8E16060"/>
man for that great and only relief against the pains of calumny, a good conscience.</P>
<P>JUDGE not of mankind in general from the conduct of a few individuals. There are persons capable of alleviating all our cares by a friendly participation, and of heightening every satisfaction by sharing them. Cultivate an acquaintance with the truly deserving, and the painful remembrance of in∣gratitude will soon be lost in the reciprocal endearments of sin∣cere friendship.</P>
<P>DOST thou ask a torch to discover the brightness of the morning? Dost thou appeal to argument for proofs of divine perfection? Look down to the earth on which thou standest, and lift up thine eye to the worlds that roll above thee: Thou be∣holdest splendour, abundance and beauty; is not he who pro∣duced them mighty? Thou considerest—is not he who formed thy understanding, wise? Thou enjoyest—is not he who gra∣tifies thy senses, good? Can aught have limited his bounty, but his wisdom? or can any defects be therein discovered by thy sagacity?</P>
<P>RELIGION prescribes to every miserable man, the means of bettering his condition; it shews him, that the bear∣ing of his afflictions as he ought to do, will naturally end in the removal of them; it makes him easy here, because it can make him happy hereafter.</P>
<P>A CONTENTED mind is the greatest blessing a man can enjoy in this world; and if in the present life his happi∣ness arises from the subduing of his desires, it will arise in the next from the gratification of them.</P>
<P>EVERY wise man will consider this life only as it may conduce to the happiness of the other, and cheerfully sacrifice the pleasures of a few years to those of an eternity.</P>
<P>HOWEVER far some men may have gone in the science of impartiality, perhaps there is not one of them but would be surprized, if he could be shewn how much farther he might go.</P>

<HEAD>A Thought on Death.</HEAD>
<P>DEATH, to a good man, is but passing through a dark entry, out of one little dusky room of his father's house, into another, that is fair and large, lightsome, glorious and di∣vinely entertaining.</P>
<P>THERE is nothing of greater importance to us, than to sift our thoughts, and examine all the dark recesses of the mind, if we would establish our souls in such a solid and substantial virtue, as will turn to account in that great day, when it must stand the test of infinite wisdom and justice.</P>
<P>ALL the real pleasures and conveniences of life, lie in a narrow compass; but it is the humour of mankind, to be al∣ways looking forward, and straining after those who have got the start of them in wealth and honour.</P>
<P>A Good conscience is to the soul, what health is to the body; it preserves a constant ease and serenity within us, and more than countervails all the calamities and afflictions which can possibly befal us. I know nothing so hard for a generous mind to get over, as calumny and reproach; and cannot find any method of quieting the soul under them, besides this single one, of our being conscious to ourselves, that we do not deserve them.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE POOR.</HEAD>
<P>THE Providence of Almighty God, has placed you under difficult circumstances of life, and daily reads you a lesson in a more particular manner to depend upon him. This you may be assured of for your comfort, that you are under God's constant and immediate care: And one advantage you enjoy above the rich, in your journey to Heaven, is, that you are not clogged and hindered in your course thither, by those manifold incumbrances which lie on them▪ of whom our Saviour hath said, "That it is very hard for them to enter into the king∣dom of Heaven." Their temptations are proportioned to their abundance; their cares are more and their distractions greater; so that you have no reason to envy them, nor repine at your own condition; and these are chiefly your temptations, and against these you must be more particularly watchful. Cer∣tainly, if you consider things aright, you will find that your store-house is the most sure, your supply most certain; for you are immediately in the hands of God, of him who feedeth the ravens, and cloatheth the grass of the field; so that you may be much more assured that he will cloathe you. Endeavour to be humble, holy, Heavenly minded; always remembering, that he is the poorest man, who is poor in grace. Your Saviour had not where to lay his head; let his example serve to recon∣cile your low condition to you; and let your religious beha∣viour under it, be the means to sanctify it.</P>

<P>THE necessities of the poor may be intended as the most certain means of preserving their health, and keeping them mo∣ral, temperate and humble, which are great virtues. While the superfluities of the rich, by subjecting them to many vices, may render the final account of their stewardship a matter of the greatest anxiety and distress of mind, to which no temporal suffering can be equivalent. Hence, if we consider present less grievous than future evil, it will appear, in this comparative view of the higher and lower ranks of men, that the differ∣ence is rather in favour of the latter, under all the pressures and mortifications of poverty.—Yet this is by no means to be used as an argument by the opulent, for withholding assistance and support from their fellow-creatures, in real want of them; for humanity, and, the cardinal virtue, charity, call upon and require all, who are able, to succour and relieve such objects— to which may be added, that this is a duty particularly en∣joined by our blessed Saviour, who has told us, as a forcible incitement to the practice of it, that such as give to the poor, lend to the Lord, which is telling us, in other words, that by this means treasure is to be laid up in Heaven.</P>

pious, in all ages, since the time of Solomon, have readily subscribed to his opinion, that all of them are indeed "vanity and vexation of spirit." For we find there are some who spend their whole time in grammar and rhetoric, or in learning to speak well, without allowing themselves any leisure to study the more important concern of living well.</P>
<P>Others there are, who are so busy in finding out the riddles of a logical sphinx, that they examine all the trifles and impertinencies of reason, to find out what reason is, and in the search thereof, oftentimes lose themselves and their reason too.</P>
<P>There are many, who, by arithmetic, learn to divide every thing into the most minute fractions, and yet do not know how to divide an halfpenny with a poor afflicted brother in the way of charity.</P>
<P>Many there are, who, by the help of geometry, can set li∣mits to grounds, and separate them from one another▪ can measure cities and countries, and yet cannot attain to any rule whereby they are enabled to measure themselves.</P>
<P>The musician can bring different voices and tones into one harmony, and yet all the while may have nothing that is har∣monious in his own mind; nothing, which, by reason of its perturbation, does not run counter to all musical measures.</P>
<P>The astronomer, whilst with fixed eyes he looks up to Hea∣ven, and attentively views the motion of the stars, very fre∣quently stumbles into the next ditch; and while he is fortelling things to come, loses those that are present; for tho' with fixed eyes he looks up to Heaven, yet his mind is too much darkened and defiled with the mire of this world, to think of a better.</P>
<P>The philosopher disputes gravely and accurately, of the nature of things, and yet, perhaps, is no wiser than a real child, as to the nature of himself, and the things of Heaven.</P>
<P>The physician takes care of the health of others, but as to the knowledge of the diseases of his own mind, may be as blind as a beetle; he diligently watches the variations of his patient's pulse, but how to cure the evil dispositions, and wrong tempers, in himself, he knows and cares but little about them.</P>
<P>The historian has the Theban and Trojan wars at his fingers ends, but is almost wholly ignorant of a much higher con∣cern, the proper knowledge of himself.</P>

<P>The theologist, earnestly contends for, and disputes about faith, but too seldom thinks of charity; he speaks much of God, but to help his neighbour in time of need, has too little concern.</P>
<P>The merchant is very solicitous of gain from every port to which he can extend his trade, or in which he can obtain cre∣dit—yet seldom troubles his head in establishing a correspon∣dence with that happy country, which offers the richest mer∣chandize—that neither moth can corrupt, or thieves have pow∣er to steal.</P>
<P>The farmer, tho' daily exercised with much toil and fatigue, in breaking up and improving the most stubb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and rugged soils, with a view to a beneficial crop, yet how does he neglect, year after year, to break up and improve the barren soil of his own heart, which, without equal care and cultivation, will ne∣ver produce that crop of good works, which makes truly rich, and adds no sorrow.</P>
<P>Arts and sciences do indeed weary the minds of men with continual labour, but yield them no true felicity.</P>

"Attuning all its passions into peace."</P>
<P>The astronomer, if enlightened by it, must contemplate, with wonder and admiration, those luminaries which his eye so often gazes on with pleasure. The philosopher too, when the wonders of nature are opened to his view, with what ado∣ration and gratitude must he look to that great source from whence they flow! And in all professions, how imperfect is man unless illumined by the bright rays of religion, which, like the glorious luminary, the sun, will enlighten all our paths.</P>
