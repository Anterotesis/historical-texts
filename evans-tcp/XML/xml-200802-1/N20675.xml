<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY THE REV. MR. NARES.</BYLINE>
<STAGE><HI>Spoken by Mr.</HI> FARREN.</STAGE>
<SP>
<LG>
<L>OUR Author, who accuses great and small,</L>
<L>And says so boldly, there are faults in all;</L>
<L>Sends me with dismal voice, and lengthen'd phiz,</L>
<L>Humbly to own one dreadful fault of his:</L>
<L>A fault, in modern Authors not uncommon,</L>
<L>It is,—now don't angry—He's—<HI>a woman.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Can you forgive it? Nay, I'll tell you more,</L>
<L>One who has dar'd to venture here before;</L>
<L>Has seen your smiles, your frowns,—tremendous sight!</L>
<L>O, be not in a frowning mood to night!</L>
<L>The Play, perhaps, has many things amiss:</L>
<L>Well, let us then reduce the point to this,</L>
<L>Let only those that have no failings, hiss.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>The Rights of Women,</HI> says a female pen,</L>
<L>Are, to do every thing as well as Men.</L>
<L>To think, to argue, to decide, to write,</L>
<L>To talk, undoubtedly—perhaps, to fight.</L>
<L>[For Females march to war, like brave Commanders,</L>
<L>Not in old Authors only—but in Flanders.]</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I grant this matter may be strain'd too far,</L>
<L>And Maid 'gainst Man is most uncivil war:</L>
<L>I grant, as all my City friends will say,</L>
<L>That Men should rule, and Women should obey:</L>
<L>That nothing binds the marriage contract faster,</L>
<L>Than our—a "Zounds, Madam, I'm your lord and master."</L>
<L>I grant their nature, and their frailty such,</L>
<L>Women may make too free—and know too much.</L>
<L>But since the Sex at length has been inclin'd</L>
<L>To cultivate that useful part—the mind;—</L>
<L>Since they have learnt to read, to write, to spell;—</L>
<L>Since some of them have wit,—and use it well;—</L>
<L>Let us not force them back with brow severe,</L>
<L>Within the pale of ignorance and fear.</L>
<L><PB REF="027154_0003_0FD58F4EB51C63C8"/>Confin'd entirely to domestic arts,</L>
<L>Producing only children, pies, and tarts.</L>
<L>The fav'rite fable of the tuneful Nine.</L>
<L>Implies that female genius <HI>is divine.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then, drive not, Critics, with tyrannic rage,</L>
<L>A supplicating Fair-one from the Stage;</L>
<L>The Comic Muse perhaps is growing old,</L>
<L>Her lovers, you well know, are few and cold.</L>
<L>'Tis time then freely to enlarge the plan,</L>
<L>And let all those write Comedies—that can.</L>

<HEAD>SCENE I. An Apartment at Mr. <HI>PLACID's.</HI></HEAD>
<STAGE>Enter Mr. <HI>PLACID</HI> and Mr. <HI>SOLUS.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PLACID.</SPEAKER>
<P>YOU are to blame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say the same by you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet your singularity pleases me; for you the first elderly bachelor I ever knew, who did not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> himself in the reflexion, that he was not in the tram∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s of wedlock.—And you really wish you were married?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do. I wish still more, that I had been married thirty years ago. Oh! I wish a wife and half a score children would now start up around me, and bring along with them all that affection, which we should have had for each other by being earlier acquainted. But as it is, in my present state, there is not a person in the world I care a straw for; and the world is pretty even with me, for I don't believe there is a creature in it who cares a straw for me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw! you have in your time been a man of gallantry; and, consequently, must have made many at∣tachments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, such as men of gallantry usually make. I
<PB N="6" REF="027154_0005_0fd58f58d4734290"/>have been attached to women who have purloined my for∣tune, and to men who have partaken of the theft: I have been in as much fear of my mistress as you are of your wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is that possible?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and without having one of those tender, delicate ties of a husband, an excuse for my apprehension. —I have maintained children —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then why do you complain for the want of a family?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not say I ever had any children; I said I had <HI>maintained</HI> them; but I never believed they were mine; for I could have no dependance upon the principles of their mother—and never did I take one of those tender infants in my arms, that the forehead of my Valet, the squint eye of my Apothecary, or the double chin of my Chaplain, did not stare me in the face, and damp all the fine feelings of the parent, which I had just called up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>But those are accidents which may occur in the marriage state.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>In that case, a man is pitied—in mine, he is only laughed at.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish to heaven I could exchange the pity which my friends bestow on me, for the merriment which your ill fate excites.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>You want but courage to be envied.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does any one doubt my courage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. If a Prince were to offend you, you would challenge him, I have no doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if my wife offend me, I am obliged to make an apology—Was not that her voice? I hope she has not overheard our conversation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>If she have, she'll be in an ill humour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>That she will be, whether she have heard it or not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, good day. I don't like to be driven from my plan, my fixed plan of wedlock; and, therefore, I won't be a spectator of your mutual discontent.</P>
<STAGE>[Going.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>But before you go, Mr. Solus, permit me to remind you of a certain concern, that, I think, would afford you much more delight, than all you can, at this
<PB N="7" REF="027154_0006_0fd58f5da7bf3390"/>time of life, propose to yourself in marriage. Make happy by your beneficence, a near relation whom the truest affec∣tion has drawn into that state, but who is denied the bles∣sing of competency to make the state supportable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mean my nephew, Irwin? But do not you acknowledge he has a wife and children? Did not he marry the woman he loved, and has he not, at this mo∣ment, a large family, by whom he is beloved? And is he not, therefore, with all his poverty, much happier than I? He has often told me, when I have reproached him with his indiscreet marriage, "that in his wife he possessed kingdoms!" Do you suppose I will give any part of my fortune to a man who enjoys such extensive domains? No: —let him preserve his territories, and I will keep my lit∣tle estate for my own use.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>

<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>John! John!— <STAGE>[Enter Servant]</STAGE> Has your mis∣tress been inquiring for me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir:—My Lady asked just now, if I knew who was with you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did she seem angry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir;—pretty well.</P>

<P>You scoundrel, what do you mean by "pretty well?" <STAGE>[In anger.]</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Much as usual, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you call that "pretty well?" You scoundrel, I have a great mind—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter Mrs. <HI>PLACID,</HI> speaking very loud.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is the matter, Mr. Placid? What is all this noise about? You know I hate a noise. What is the matter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear, I was only finding fault with that blockhead.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Mr. Placid, do not find fault with any body in this house. But I have something which I must take <HI>you</HI> very severely to task about, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my dear, not just now, pray.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid, looking at his watch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because dinner will be ready in a few minutes. I am very hungry, and it will be
<PB N="8" REF="027154_0007_0fd58f5e807cbd98"/>cruel of you to spoil my appetite. John, is the dinner on table?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, John, don't let it be served yet— Mr. Placid, you <HI>shall</HI> first hear what I have to say.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Sitting down.</STAGE>
<STAGE>[Exit Servant.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then I know I shan't be able to eat a morsel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sit down. <STAGE>[He sits]</STAGE> — I believe, Mr. Pla∣cid, you are going to do a very silly thing. I am afraid you are going to lend some money?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my dear, and suppose I am?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, I don't approve of people lending their money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, my dear, I have known you approve of borrowing money: And, once in our lives, what should we have done, if every body had refused to lend?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is nothing to the purpose.—And now I desire you will hear what I say, without speaking a word yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my dear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now mind you don't speak, till I have done.— Our old acquaintance, Captain Irwin, —Lady Eleanor, his wife (with whom we lived upon very inti∣mate terms, to be sure, while we were in America), are returned to England; and I find you have visited them very frequently.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not above two or three times, upon my word; for it hurts me to see them in distress, and I forbear to go.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>There! You own they are in distress; I expected as much. Now, own to me that they asked you to lend them money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do own it—I do own it. Now are you sa∣tisfied?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>No: for I have no doubt but you have promised they shall have it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, upon my word, I have not promised.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then promise me they shall not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, my dear, you have no idea of their dis∣tress!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I have; and 'tis that which makes me suspicious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="027154_0008_0fd58f5ff66458d0"/>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>His regiment is now broken; all her jewels and little bawbles are disposed of; he is in such dread of his old creditors, that, in the lodging they have taken, he passes by the name of Middleton—They have three more children, my dear, than when we left them in New En∣gland; and they have in vain sent repeated supplications, both to his uncle, and her father, for the smallest bounty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is not Lord Norland, her father, a remarkably wise man? and a good man? And ought you to do for them, what he has refused?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>They have offended him, but they have never offended me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think 'tis an offence to ask a friend for money, when there is no certainty of returning it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means: for, if there <HI>were</HI> a certainty, even an enemy might lend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I insist, Mr. Placid, that they shall not find a friend in you upon this occasion. What do you say, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid, after a struggle.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my dear, they shall not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Positively shall not?</P>

<SP>

<STAGE>Enter Mr. <HI>HARMONY</HI> followed by Miss <HI>SPINSTER.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Spinster.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cousin, cousin Harmony, I will not for∣give you for thus continually speaking in the behalf of every servant whom you find me offended with. Your
<PB N="10" REF="027154_0009_0fd58f61a1a042d8"/>philanthropy becomes insupportable; and, instead of be∣ing a virtue, degenerates into a vice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Madam, do not upbraid me for a con∣stitutional fault.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Spinster.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true; you had it from your infancy. I have heard your mother say you were always foolishly tender-hearted, and never showed one of those discrimi∣nating passions of envy, hatred, or revenge, to which all her other children were liable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>No: since I can remember, I have felt the most unbounded affection for all my fellow creatures. I even protest to you, dear Madam, that, as I walk along streets of this large metropolis, so warm is my heart to∣wards every person who passes me, that I long to say, "How do you do?" and "I am glad to see you," to them all. Some men, I should like even to stop and shake hands with;—and some women, I should like even to stop and kiss.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Spinster.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can you be so ridiculous!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, 'tis truth: and I sincerely lament that human beings should be such strangers to one another as we are. We live in the same street, without knowing one another's necessities; and oftentimes meet and part from each other at church, at coffee-houses, play houses, and all public places, without ever speaking a single word, or nodding "Good bye!" though tis a hundred chances to ten we never see one another again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Spinster.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me tell you, kinsman, all this pre∣tended philanthropy renders you ridiculous.—There is not a fraud, a theft, or hardly any vice committed, that you do not take the criminal's part, shake your head, and cry, "Provisions are so scarce!" And no longer ago than last Lord-mayor's day, when you were told that Mr. Alder∣man Ravenous was ill with an indigestion, you endeavoured to soften the matter, by exclaiming, "Provisions are so scarce!"—But, above all, I condemn the false humanity, which induces you to say many things in conversation which deserve to stigmatize you with the character of de∣ceit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a weakness I confess. But though my honour sometimes reproaches me with it as a fault, my
<PB N="11" REF="027154_0010_0fd58f63019f0618"/>conscience never does: for it is by this very failing that I have frequently made the bitterest enemies friends—Just by saying a few harmless sentences, which, though a spe∣cies of falsehood and deceit, yet, being soothing and ac∣ceptable to the person offended, I have immediately inspir∣ed him with lenity and forgiveness; and then, by only repeating the self-same sentences to his opponent, I have known hearts cold and closed to each other, warmed and expanded, as every human creature's ought to be.</P>

<P>Now you are here, you had better stay with me: we have no company; only my cousin Miss Spinster and myself.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I must go home: do come to my house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, pray stay: what objection can you have?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, to tell you the truth, your relation, Miss Spinster, is no great favourite of mine; and I don't like to dine with you, because I don't like her company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is, to me, surprizing!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, old bachelors and old maids never agree: we are too much alike in our habits: we know our own hearts so well, we are apt to discover every foible we would wish to forget, in the symptoms displayed by the other. Miss Spinster is peevish, fretful and tiresome, and I am always in a fidget when I am in her company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>How different are her sentiments of you! for one of her greatest joys is to be in your company. <STAGE>[<HI>Solus</HI>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, perhaps I am mistaken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>—But I will assure you, I never see her in half such good humour as when you are here: for I believe you are the greatest favourite she has.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very much obliged to her, and I certainly <HI>am</HI> mistaken about her temper—Some people, if they look ever so cross, are good-natured in the main; and I dare say she is so. Besides, she never has had a husband to sooth and soften her disposition; and there should be some allowance made for that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you dine with us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't care if I do. Yes, I think I will. I must however step home first: but I'll be back in a quar∣ter of an hour.—My compliments to Miss Spinster, if you should see her before I return.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Madam, I could not help inviting him; for, poor man, his own house is in such a state for want of proper management, he cannot give a comfortable din∣ner himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Spinst.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so he must spoil the comfort of mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor man! poor man! after all the praises he has been lavishing upon you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Spinster.</SPEAKER>
<P>What praises!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>I won't tell you; for you won't believe them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Spinster.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I shall.—Oh no—now I recollect, this is some of your invention.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I told him it was <HI>his</HI> invention: for he declared you looked better last night, than any other lady at the Opera.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Spinster.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, this sounds like truth:—and depend
<PB N="13" REF="027154_0012_0fd58f65fa789120"/>upon it, though I never liked the manners of Mr. Solus much, yet—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Solus has his faults.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Spinster.</SPEAKER>
<P>So we all have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>And will you leave him and me to dine by ourselves?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Spinster.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh no, I cannot be guilty of such ill manners, though I talked of it. Besides, poor Mr. Solus does not come so often, and it would be wrong not to show him all the civility we can. For my part, I have no dis∣like to the man; and, if taking a bit of dinner with us now and then, can oblige either you or him, I should be to blame to make any objection. Come, let us go into the drawing-room to receive him.</P>

<HEAD>SCENE III. A room at the lodgings of Mr. <HI>IRWIN.</HI></HEAD>
<STAGE>Mr. <HI>IRWIN</HI> and Lady <HI>ELEANOR IRWIN</HI> discovered.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Eleanor.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear husband, my dear Irwin, I can∣not bear to see you thus melancholy. Is this the joy of returning to our native country after nine years banishment?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Irwin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. For I could bear my misfortunes, my wretched poverty with patience, in a land where our sor∣rows were shared by those about us; but here, in London, where plenty and ease smile upon every face; where, by birth you claim distinction, and I by services:— here to be in want,—to be obliged to take another name in shame of our own,—to tremble at the voice of every stranger, for fear he should be a creditor,—to meet each old acquaintance with an averted eye, because we would not feel the pang of being shunned — To have no reward for all this, even in a comfortable home; but there to see our children looking up to me for support I have not in my power to give—Can I,—can I love them and you, and not be miserable?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Eleanor.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet I am not so. And I am sure you will not doubt my love to you or them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Irwin.</SPEAKER>
<P>I met my uncle this morning, and was mean
<PB N="14" REF="027154_0013_0fd58f67b3239938"/>enough to repeat my request to him:—he burst into a fit of laughter, and told me my distresses were the result of my ambition, in marrying the daughter of a nobleman, who himself was too ambitious ever to pardon us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Eleanor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell me no more of what he said.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Irwin</SPEAKER>
<P>This was a day of trials:—I saw your father too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Eleanor.</SPEAKER>
<P>My father! Lord Norland! Oh Heaven!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Irwin.</SPEAKER>
<P>He passed me in his carriage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Eleanor.</SPEAKER>
<P>I envy you the blessing of seeing him! For oh! excuse my tears—he is my father still—How did he look?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Irwin.</SPEAKER>
<P>As well as he did at the time I used to watch him from his house to steal to you.—But I am sorry to acquaint you, that, to guard himself against all returning love for you, he has, I am informed, adopted a young lad, on whom he bestows every mark of that paternal af∣fection, of which you lament the loss.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Eleanor.</SPEAKER>
<P>May the young man deserve his tenderness better than I have done—May he never disobey him — May <HI>he</HI> be a comfort, and cherish his benefactor's declin∣ing years — And when his youthful passions teach him to love, may they not, like mine, teach him disobedience!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter a <HI>SERVANT</HI> with a letter.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Irwin.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is that letter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Servant.</SPEAKER>
<P>It comes from Mr. Placid, the servant who brought it, said, and requires no answer.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Irwin.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's strange how I tremble at every letter I see, as if I dreaded the contents. How poverty has unmann'd me! <STAGE>[aside]</STAGE> —I must tell you, my dear, that finding my∣self left this morning without a guinea, I wrote to Mr. Placid to borrow a small sum. This is his answer: <STAGE>[read∣ing the superscription]</STAGE> "To Mr. Middleton"—That's right;—he remembers the caution I gave him. I had forgot whether I had, for my memory is not so good as it was. I did not even recollect this hand, though it is one I am so well acquainted with, and ought to give me joy rather than sorrow <STAGE>[Opens the letter hastily, reads, and lets it drop]</STAGE> Now I have not a friend on earth.</P>

<SPEAKER>Irwin, in a transport of grief.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would forget you— you—and all your children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Eleanor.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would not lose the remembrance of you, or of them, for all my father's fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Where would you go? 'Tis evening—'tis dark—Whither would you go at this time?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Irwin, distractedly.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must consider what's to be done— and in this room my thoughts are too confined to reflect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Eleanor.</SPEAKER>
<P>And are London streets calculated for reflexion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Irwin.</SPEAKER>
<P>No;—for action —To hurry the faint thought to resolution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Eleanor.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are not well—Your health has been lately impaired.—Your temper has undergone a change too—I tremble lest any accident—</P>

<SPEAKER>Irwin.</SPEAKER>
<P>What accident? <STAGE>[Wildly.]</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Eleanor.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know your provocations from an un∣grateful world: But despise it, as that despises you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Irwin.</SPEAKER>
<P>But for your sake, I could.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Eleanor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then witness. Heaven! I am happy.— Though bred in all the delicacy, the luxury of wealth and splendour; yet I have never murmured at the change of fortune, while that change has made me wife to you, and mother of your children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Irwin.</SPEAKER>
<P>We <HI>will</HI> be happy—if possible. But give me this evening to consider what plan to fix upon.—There is no time to lose; we are without friends—without money —without credit.—Farewell for an hour.—I will see Mr. Placid, if I can; and though he have not the money to lend, he may, perhaps, give me some advice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Eleanor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suppose I call on <HI>her</HI>? Women are more considerate than men, and—</P>

<STAGE>Enter Sir <HI>ROBERT RAMBLE</HI>—and Mr. <HI>SOLUS,</HI> and Mr. <HI>PLACID</HI> at the opposite Side.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Robert Ramble, how do you do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Mr. Solus, I am glad to see you. I have been dining by myself, and now come into this pub∣lic room to meet with some good company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Sir Robert, you are now reduced to the same necessity which I frequently am—I frequently am obliged to dine at taverns and coffee-houses, for want of company at home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I protest I am never happier than in a house like this, where a man may meet his friend with∣out the inconvenience of form, either as a host or a visitor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Robert, give me leave to introduce to you Mr. Placid: he has been many years abroad; but I be∣lieve he now means to remain in his own country for the rest of his life. This, Mr. Placid, is Sir Robert Ramble.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert, to Mr. Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I shall be happy in your acquaintance; and I assure you, if you will do me the honour to meet me now and then at this house, you will find every thing very pleasant. I verily believe, that since I lost my wife, which is now about five months ago, I verily believe I have dined here three days out of the seven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you lost your wife, Sir? And so lately?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert, with great indifference.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir; about five months ago—Is it not, Mr. Solus? You keep account of such things better than I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! ask me no questions about your wife, Sir Robert; if she had been mine, I would have had her to this moment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, wrested her from the gripe of death?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir; only from the gripe of the Scotch lawyers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>More shame for you. Shame! to wish to be divorced from a virtuous wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was that the case? Divorced from a virtuous
<PB N="17" REF="027154_0016_0fd58f700a0ebcd0"/>wife! I never heard of such a circumstance before. Pray, Sir Robert <STAGE>[very anxiously]</STAGE>, will you indulge me, by let∣ting me know in what manner you were able to bring about so great an event?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may appear strange to you, Sir; but my wife and I did not live happy together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all strange, Sir; I can conceive—I can conceive very well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; he can conceive that part to a nicety.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so, I was determined on a divorce.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then her character could not be unimpeached.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, it was, Sir. You must know, we were married in Scotland, and by the laws there, a wife <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> divorce her <HI>husband</HI> for breach of fidelity; and so, thou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> my wife's character was unimpeached, mine was not, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> she divorced me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is this the law in Scotland?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is. Blessed, blessed country! that will bind young people together before the years of discretion —and, as soon as they have discretion to repent, will un∣bind them again!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish I had been married in Scotland.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir Robert, with all this boasting, you must own that your divorce has greatly diminished your fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert, taking Solus aside.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Solus, you have fre∣quently hinted at my fortune being impaired; but I do not approve of such notions being received abroad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg your pardon; but every body knows that you have played very deep lately, and have been a great loser, and every body knows —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, every body does not know it, for I contradict the report wherever I go. A man of fashion does not like to be reckoned poor, no more than he likes to be reckoned unhappy. We none of us endeavour to <HI>be</HI> happy, Sir, but merely to be <HI>thought</HI> so; and for my part, I had rather be in a state of misery, and envied for my supposed happiness, than in a state of happiness, and pi∣tied for my supposed misery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>But consider, these misfortunes which I have just hinted at, are not of any serious nature, only such as a few years economy —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="18" REF="027154_0017_0fd58f7174c44530"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>But were my wife and her guardian to be∣come acquainted with these little misfortunes, they would triumph in my embarrassments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lady Ramble triumph! She who was so firmly attached to you, that I believe nothing but a compliance with your repeated request to be separated, caused her to take the step she did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I believe she did it to oblige me, and I am very much obliged to her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>As good a woman— <STAGE>[Placid joins them]</STAGE>—Mr. Placid—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very good— but very ugly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is beautiful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert, to Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you, Sir, she is hideous. And then she was grown so insufferably peevish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never saw her out of temper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Solus, it is very uncivil of you to praise her before my face. Lady Ramble, at the time I parted with her, had every possible fault both of mind and person, and so I made love to other women in her presence; told her bluntly that I was tired of her; that <Q>I was very sorry to make her uneasy, but that I could not love her any longer.</Q>
—And was not that frank and open?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! that I had but such a wife as she was!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must own I loved her myself when she was young.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you call her old?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>In years I am certainly older than she; but the difference of sex makes her a great deal older than I am. For instance, Mr. Solus, you have often lamented not being married in your youth; but if you had, what would you have now done with an old wife, a woman of your own age?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Loved and cherished her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, in spite of her loss of beauty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>When she had lost her beauty, most likely I should have lost my eye sight, and have been blind to the wane of her charms.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid anxiously.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir Robert, you were explaining to me—Mr. Solus, give me leave to speak to Sir Robert
<PB N="19" REF="027154_0018_0fd58f72b4de5ce0"/>—I feel myself particularly interested on this subject.— And, Sir, you were explaining to me—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true: where did I leave off? Oh! at my ill usage of my lady Ramble. Yes, I did use her very ill, and yet she loved me. Many a time, when she has said to me, "Sir Robert, I detest your principles, your manners, and even your person," often, at that very in∣stant, I have seen a little sparkle of a wish peep out at the corner of one eye, that has called to me, "Oh! Sir Ro∣bert, how I long to make it up with you!"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus, to Mr. Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not you wish that your wife had such a little sparkle at the corner of one of her eyes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert, to Mr. Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, do you wish to be di∣vorced?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have no such prospect. Mrs. Placid is faith∣ful, and I was married in England.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if you have an unconquerable desire to part, a separate maintenance will answer nearly the same end—for if your lady and you will only lay down the plan of separation, and agree—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, unfortunately, we never do agree!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then speak of parting as a thing you dread worse than death; and make it your daily prayer to her, that she will never think of going from you—She will determine upon it directly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you; I'm very much obliged to you; I thank you a thousand times.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I have studied the art of teasing a wife; and there is nothing vexes her so much as laughing at her. Can you laugh, Mr. Placid?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know whether I can; I have not laughed since I married —But I thank you, Sir, for your instructions—I sincerely thank you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>And now, Sir Robert, you have had the good nature to teach this Gentleman how to get rid of his wife, will you have the kindness to teach me how to procure one?</P>

<P>My dear Captain Irwin, is it you? Yes, 'faith it is—After a nine years' absence I most sincerely rejoice to see you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Irwin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Robert, you shake hands with a cordiality I have not experienced these many days, and I thank you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what's the matter? You seem to droop —Where have you left your usual spirits? Has absence from your country changed you manners?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Irwin.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir; but I find some of my countrymen changed. I fancy them less warm, less friendly than they were; and it is that which, perhaps, has this effect upon me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Am I changed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Irwin.</SPEAKER>
<P>You appear an exception.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I assure you, that instead of being grown more gloomy, I am even more gay than I was seven years ago; for then, I was upon the point of matrimony —but now, I am just relieved from its cares.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Irwin.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard as much. But I hope you have not taken so great an aversion to the marriage-state, as never to marry again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps not: But then it must be to some rich heiress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Irwin.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are right to pay respect to fortune. Money is a necessary article in the marriage contract.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to that—that would be no great object at present. No, thank Heaven, my estates are pretty large; I have no children; I have a rich Uncle, excellent health, admirable spirits,—and thus happy, it would be very strange if I did not meet my old friends with those smiles, which never for a moment quit my countenance.</P>

<P>In the dispensation of the gifts of Providence, how few are found blest like you! <STAGE>[Sighing.]</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>And I assure you, my dear Mr. Irwin, it
<PB N="21" REF="027154_0020_0fd58f78c0824790"/>gives me the most serious reflexions, and the most sincere concern, that they are not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Irwin.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you, Sir, most heartily: I thank you for mankind in general, and for myself in particular. For after this generous, unaffected declaration (with less scru∣ple than I should to any man in the world) I will own to you, that I am at this very time in the utmost w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t of an act of friendship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert, aside.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so am I—Now must I confess myself a poor man; or pass for an unfeeling one; and I will choose the latter. <STAGE>[Bowing with great ceremony and coldness.]</STAGE> Any thing that I can command, is at your service.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Irwin, Confounded and hesitating.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, Sir Ro∣bert—I am almost ashamed to say it—but circumstances have been rather unfavourable.—My wife's father <STAGE>[affect∣ing to smile]</STAGE> is not reconciled to us yet—My regiment is broke—My Uncle will not part with a farthing.—Lady Eleanor, my wife, <STAGE>[wipes his eyes]</STAGE> has been supported as yet, with some little degree of tenderness, elegance; and —in short, I owe a small sum which I am afraid of being troubled for; I want a trifle also for our immediate use, and if you would lend me a hundred pounds—though, upon my honour, I am not in a situation to fix the exact time when I can pay it—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Sir, never trouble yourself about the time of paying it, because it happens not to be in my power to lend it you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Irwin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in your power? I beg your pardon; but have not you this moment been saying you are rich?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is it not very common to be rich with∣out money? Are not half the town rich? And yet half the town has no money. I speak for this end of the town, the West end. The Squares, for instance, part of Picca∣dilly, down St. James's street, and so home by Pall Mall. We have all, estates, bonds, draughts, and notes of hand without number; but as for money, we have no such thing belonging to us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Irwin.</SPEAKER>
<P>I sincerely beg your pardon. And be assured, Sir, nothing should have induced me to have taken the liberty I have done, but the necessities of my unhappy
<PB N="22" REF="027154_0021_0fd58f7a38175c18"/>family, and having understood by your own words, that you were in affluence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>I <HI>am</HI> in affluence, I am, I am; but not in so much, perhaps, as my hasty, inconsiderate account may have given you reason to believe. I forgot to mention se∣veral heavy incumbrances, which you will perceive are great drawbacks on my fortune.—As my wife sued for the divorce, I have her fortune to return; I have also two sisters to portion off—a circumstance I totally forgot. But, my good friend, though I am not in circumstances to do what you require, I will do something that shall be better. I'll wait upon your father-in-law, (Lord Norland) and entreat him to forgive his daughter: and I am sure he will if I ask him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Irwin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impossible!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so it is, now I recollect: for he is no other than the guardian of my late wife, and a request from me, will be received worse than from any other per∣son.—However, Mr. Irwin, depend upon it, that when∣ever I have an opportunity of serving you, I will. And whenever you shall do me the favour to call upon me, I shall be heartily glad to see you. If I am not at home, you can leave your card, which, you know, is all the same, and depend upon it, I shall be extremely glad to see you or that, at any time.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Irwin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is this my native country? Is this the hospit∣able land which we describe to strangers? No—We are savages to each other; nay worse — The savage makes his fellow savage welcome; divides with him his homely fare; gives him the best apartment his but affords, and tries to hush those griefs that are consided in his bosom—While in this civilized city, among my own countrymen, even among my brother officers in the army, and many of my nearest relations, so very civilized they are, I could not take the liberty to enter under one roof, without a cere∣monious invitation, and that they will not give me. I may leave my card at their door, but as for me, or any one of mine, they would not give us a dinner; unless, indeed, it was in such a style, that we might behold with admiration their grandeur, and return still more depressed, to our own poverty.— Can I bear this treatment longer? No, not
<PB N="23" REF="027154_0022_0fd58f7bce52dad8"/>even for you, my Eleanor. And this <STAGE>[takes out a pistol]</STAGE> shall now be the only friend to whom I will apply—And yet I want the courage to be a villain.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Irwin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Am I a man, a soldier?—And a coward? Yes, I run away, I turn my back on life—I forsake the post, which my commander, Providence, has allotted me, and fly before a banditti of rude misfortunes. Rally me, love, connubial and parental love, rally me back to the charge! No, those very affections found the retreat.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Irwin, his mind deranged by his misfortunes.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir: But what have you to say to him more than to a stranger?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing more, Sir, than to apologize to you, for having addressed you just now in so familiar a manner, before I knew who you were; and to assure you, that although I have no other knowledge of you, than from report, and having been once, I believe, in your company at this very house before you left England; yet, any ser∣vices of mine, as far as my abilities can reach, you may freely command.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Irwin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir, do you live at the West end of the town?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Irwin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Sir, your services can be of no use to me.</P>

<P>Here is the place where I live, here is my card.</P>
<STAGE>[Gives it to him.</STAGE>

<P>And here is mine. And now I presume we have exchanged every act of friendship, which the strict forms of etiquette, in this town, will admit of.</P>

<P>By no means, Sir. I assure you my profes∣sions never go beyond my intentions; and if there is any thing that I can serve you in—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Irwin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you no sisters to portion off? no lady's fortune to return? Or, perhaps, you will speak to my wife's father, and entreat him to forgive his child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>On that subject you may command me; for I have the honour to be intimately acquainted with Lord Norland.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Irwin.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is there no reason you may recollect, "why you would be the most unfit person in the world to apply to him?"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>None. I have been honoured with marks of his friendship for many years past; and I do not know any one who could, with less hazard of his resentment, venture to name his daughter to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Irwin</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, if you should see him two or three days hence, when I am set out on a journey I am going, if you will then say a kind word to him for my wife and children, I'll thank you.</P>

<P>No very tedious journey; but it is a country, to those who go without a proper passport, always fatal.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll see Lord Norland to-night: perhaps I may persuade him to prevent your journey. I'll see him to-night, or early in the morning, depend upon it.—I am a man of my word, Sir; though I must own I do live at the West end of the town.</P>

<P>'Sdeath, am I become the ridicule of my fellow-creatures? or am I not in my senses?—I know this is Lon∣don—this house a tavern—I know I have a wife. Oh!

<P>I tell you, Mr. Harmony, that is an indifferent person, one on whom I had never bestowed a savour in my life, were to offend me, it is in my nature never to forgive. Can I then forgive my own daughter, my only child, on whom I heaped continually marks of the most affectionate fondness?

<P>Your child, consider.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Norland.</SPEAKER>
<P>The weakest argument you can use. As my child, was not she most bound to obey me? As my child ought she not to have sacrificed her own happiness to mine? Instead of which, mine has been yielded up for a whim, a fancy, a fancy to marry a beggar; and as such is her choice, let her beg with him.</P>

<P>I have no doubt of it: and, that I may not be the means of aggravating your displeasure, I assure you, that what I have now said has been entirely from myself, without any desire of hers; and, at the same time, I give you my promise, I will never presume to intrude the sub∣ject <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gain.</P>

<P>That you have a lawful heir to all your riches; proud that you have a grandson.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Norland.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would have concealed it from all the world; I wished it even unknown to myself. And let me tell you, Sir, (as not by design, but through my inadver∣tency, you are become acquainted with this secret) that, if ever you breathe it to a single creature, the boy shall answer for it; for, were he known to be her's, though he
<PB N="33" REF="027154_0032_0fd58f924795e118"/>were dearer to me than ever <HI>she</HI> was, I would turn him from my house and cast him from my heart, as I have done her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe you;—and in compassion to the child, give you my <HI>solemn promise</HI> never to reveal who he is. I have heard that those unfortunate parents left an in∣fant behind when they went abroad, and that they lament him as lost. Will you satisfy my curiosity, in what man∣ner you sought and found him out?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Norland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you suppose I searched for him? No;—he was forced upon me. A woman followed me, about eight years ago, in the fields adjoining to my country seat, with a half starved boy in her hand, and asked my charity for my grand child: the impression of the word, made me turn round involuntarily; and casting my eyes upon him, I was rejoiced, not to find a feature of his mother's in all his face; and I began to feel something like pity for him. In short, he caught such fast hold by one of my fingers, that I asked him carelessly "if he would go home and live with me?" On which, he answered me so willingly "Yes," I took him at his word.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did never your regard for him, plead in his mother's behalf?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Norland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never. For, by Heaven, I would as soon forgive the robber who met me last night at my own door, and, holding a pistol to my breast, took from me a sum to a considerable amount, as I would pardon her.</P>

<P>You forget I am a stranger, and my presence may not be welcome.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Norland.</SPEAKER>
<P>A stranger! What, to my ward? to Lady Ramble? for that is the name which custom would autho∣rise her to keep; but such courtesy she disdains, in con∣tempt of the unworthy giver of the title.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am intimate with Sir Robert, my Lord; and though I acknowledge that both you and his lady have cause for complaint, yet Sir Robert has still many virtues.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Norland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not one. He is the most vile, the most detestable of characters. He not only contradicted my will in the whole of his conduct, but he seldom met me that he did not give me some personal affront.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is, however, generally held better to be un∣civil in a person's presence, than in his absence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Norland.</SPEAKER>
<P>He was uncivil to me in every respect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I will deny; for I have heard Sir Ro∣bert, in your absence, say such things in your praise!—</P>

<P>I wish he had sometimes done me the honour to have spoken politely to my face.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is not Sir Robert's way;—he is no flat∣terer. But then, no sooner has your back been turned, than I have heard him lavish in your praise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Norland.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must own, Mr. Harmony, that I ne∣ver looked upon Sir Robert as incorrigible. I could al∣ways discern a ray of understanding, and a beam of virtue through all his foibles; nor would I have urged the divorce, but that I found his wife's sensibility could not bear his ne∣glect; and even now, notwithstanding her endeavour to conceal it, she pines in secret, and laments her hard for∣tune. All my hopes of restoring her health rest on one prospect—that of finding a man worthy of my recommen∣dation for her second husband, and, by creating a second passion, expel the first.—Mr. Harmony, you and I have been long acquainted—I have known your disposition from your infancy—Now, if such a man as you were to offer—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>

<P>I cannot say I have any particular desire; but if it will oblige either you or her,—for my part, I think the short time we live in this world, we should do all we can to oblige each other.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony, considering.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is rather a serious piece of business—However, I never did make a difficulty when I wished to oblige a friend.—But there is one provi∣so, my Lord; I must first mention it to Sir Robert.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Norland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because he and I had always been very in∣timate friends; and to marry his wife, without even tell∣ing him of it, will appear very uncivil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Norland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you mean then to ask his consent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not absolutely his consent; but I will in∣sinuate the subject to him, and obtain his approbation in a manner suitable to my own satisfaction.</P>
</SP>

<P>You will oblige me then if you will see him as early as possible; for it is reported he is going a∣broad.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Wooburn.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means, my Lord. Tears from our sex are not always the result of grief; they are fre∣quently no more than little sympathetic tributes which we pay to our fellow-beings, while the mind and the heart are steeled against the weakness which our eyes indicate.</P>

<P>I must first inform you, that Lord Nor∣land has just drawn from me a promise, that I will once more enter into the marriage-state; and without knowing to whom he intends to give me, I will keep my promise— But it is in vain to say, that, though I mean all duty and fidelity to my second husband, I shall not experience mo∣ments when my thoughts—will wander on my first.</P>

<SP>

<P>If that is all—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Wooburn.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I would go one step further: <STAGE>[<HI>Harmony</HI> starts again]</STAGE> I would secure him from those mis∣fortunes, which to hear of, will disturb my peace of mind. I know his fortune has suffered very much, and I cannot, <HI>will not,</HI> place it in the power of the man, whom my Lord Norland may point out for my next marriage, to distress him farther.—This is the writing, by which that Gentle∣man may claim the part of my fortune from Sir Robert Ramble, which is in landed property; carry it my dear Mr. Harmony, to Sir Robert instantly; and tell him, that in separating from him I meant only to give him liberty; not to make him the debtor, perhaps the prisoner of my future husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, I will most undoubtedly take this bond to my friend; but will you give me leave to suggest to you, that the person on whom you bestow your hand, may be a little surprised to find, that while he is in possessi∣on of you, Sir Robert is in the possession of your fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Wooburn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not imagine, Sir, that I shall marry any man, without first declaring what I have done—I on∣ly wish at present it should be concealed from Lord Nor∣land—When this paper is given, as I have required, it can∣not be recalled; and when that is past, I shall divulge my conduct to whom I please; and first of all, to him, who shall offer me his addresses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>And if he is a man of my feelings, his ad∣dresses will be doubly importunate for this proof of libe∣rality to your former husband.—But are you sure, that in the return of this bond, there is no secret affection, no la∣tent spark of love?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Wooburn.</SPEAKER>
<P>None. I know my heart; and if there was, I could not ask you, Mr. Harmony (nor any one like you,) to be the messenger of an imprudent passion. Sir Robert's vanity, I know, may cause him to judge otherwise; but undeceive him; let him know this is a sacrifice to the gold∣en principles of duty, and not an offering to the tinselled shrine of love.</P>

<P>Ha, ha, ha! Now, my dear Harmony, you carry your good-natured simplicity too far. However, I thank you, I sincerely thank you—But do you imagine I should be such a blockhead, as to make love to the same woman I made love to seven years ago, and who for the last six years I totally neglected?</P>

<P>Sir Robert, what is the matter? Has any thing ruffled you? Why, I never saw you look more out of temper, even while you were married.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! that I had never married! never known what marriage was! for, even at this moment, I feel its torments in my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have often heard of the torments of matrimo∣ny; but I conceive, that at the worst, they are nothing more than a kind of violent tickling, which will force the tears into your eyes, though at the same time you are bursting your sides with laughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have defined marriage too favourably; there is no laughter in the state: all is melancholy, all gloom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now I think marriage is an excellent remedy for the spleen. I have known a Gentleman at a feast re∣ceive an affront, disguise his rage, step home, vent it all upon his wife, return to his companions, and be as good company as if nothing had happened.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>But even the necessary expences of a wife should alarm you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can then retrench some of my own. Oh!
<PB N="45" REF="027154_0044_0fd58faa426c3570"/>my dear Sir, a married man has so many delightful privi∣leges to what a bachelor has!—An old Lady will intro∣duce her daughters to you in a dishabille—"it does not signify, my dears, it's a married man"—One Lady will suffer you to draw on her glove—"Never mind, it's a married man"—Another will permit you to pull on her slipper; a third will even take you into her bed-chamber —"Pshaw, it's <HI>nothing</HI> but a married man."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the weight of your fetters will overbalance all these joys.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I cannot say, notwithstanding you are re∣lieved from the bond, that I see much joy or brightness here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not very well at present; I have the head-ache; and, if ever a wife can be of comfort to her husband, it must be when he is indisposed. A wife, then, binds up your head, mixes your powders, bathes your temples, and hovers about, in a way that is most endear∣ing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't speak of it; I long to have one hover about me. But I will—I am determined I will, before I am a week older. Don't speak, don't attempt to per∣suade me not. Your description has renewed my eager∣ness—<HI>I</HI> will be married.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>And without pretending not to know who you mean to make your wife, I tell you plainly, it is Miss Wooburn, it is my late wife.—I know you have made overtures to my Lord Norland, and that he has given his consent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>You tell me a great piece of news—I'll go ask my Lord if it be true; and if he says it is, I shall be very glad to find it so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is right, Sir; marry her, marry her; —I give you joy,—that's all.—Ha, ha, ha! I think I should know her temper.—But if you will venture to marry her, I sincerely wish you happy.</P>

<P>Ay, wretched man! I suppose with terror.</P>

<P>No; it appeared a different passion from fear.</P>

<P>Perhaps, my Lord, it was <HI>your</HI> fear that made you think so.</P>

<P>No, Sir, I was not frightened.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>How has he been taken?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>A person came to our steward, and informed a∣gainst him;—and, Oh! my Lord, his poor wife told the of∣ficers who took him, they had met with misfortunes, which she feared had caused a fever in her husband's head; and, in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d, they found him too ill to be removed; and so, she hoped, she said, "that as a man, not in his perfect mind, you would be merciful to him."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Norland.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will be just.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that is being merciful, is it not, my Lord?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Norland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not always.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought it had been.—It is not <HI>just</HI> to be un∣merciful, is it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Norland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then it must be <HI>just,</HI> to have mercy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Norland.</SPEAKER>
<P>You draw a false conclusion. Great as is the virtue of <HI>mercy, justice</HI> is greater still. <HI>Justice</HI> holds its place among those cardinal virtues which include all the lesser. —Come, Mr. Harmony, will you go home with me?

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg to be excused—Besides the consideration of Sir Robert, I have another reason why I cannot go with you. The melancholy tale which this young gentleman has been telling, has cast a gloom on my spirits which renders me unfit for the society of a Lady.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Lord Norland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now I should not be surprised were you to go in search of this culprit and his family, and come to

<P>Lord Norland, I have lately been so unsuccess∣ful in my petitions to you, I shall never presume to inter∣pose between your rigour and a weak sufferer more.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord Norland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Plead the cause of the good, and I will listen; but you find none but the wicked for your compassion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>The good in all states, even in the very jaws of death, are objects of envy; it is the bad who are the only real sufferers: There, where no internal consolation cheers, who can refuse a little external comfort?—And, let me tell you, my Lord, that amidst all your authority, your state, your grandeur, I often pity you. <STAGE>[Speaking with unaffected compassion.</STAGE></P>

<P>That, I cannot fend in. But tell him, Sir, I am the afflicted wife of a man, who for some weeks past has given many fatal proofs of a disordered mind. In one of these fits of phrenzy, he held an instrument of death, meant for his own destruction, to the breast of your Lord (who by accident that moment passed,) and took from him, what he vainly hoped might preserve his own life, and relieve the wants of his family. But his paroxysm over, he shrunk from what he had done, and gave the whole he had thus unwarrantably taken, into a servant's hands to be returned to its lawful owner. The man admitted to this confidence, betrayed his trust, and instead of giving up what was so sacredly delivered to him, secreted it; and, to obtain the promised reward, came to this house, but to inform against the wretched of∣fender; who now, only resting on your Lord's clemency, can escape the direful fate he has incurred.</P>

<P>I am sure I would not add to your grief for the world.—But then, pray do not speak of what I am going to say. I heard my Lord's lawyer tell him just now, "that as he said he should not know the person again, who com∣mitted the offence about which you came, and as the man who informed against him was gone off, there could be no evidence that he did the action, but from a book, a particular pocket-book of my Lord's, which he forgot to deliver to his servant with the notes and money to return, and which was found upon him at your house: and this Lord Norland will affirm to be his."—Now, if I did not think I was doing wrong, this is the very book— <STAGE>[Takes a pocket-book from his pocket]</STAGE> I took it from my Lord's table;—but it would be doing wrong, or I am sure I wish you had it.</P>

<P>Yes, my dear; and I will take care that you shall be dutiful in the morning.</P>

<P>For shame! How can you treat Mrs. Placid thus? You would not, if you knew what kind things she has been saying of you; and how anxious she was when I told her you were wounded in a duel.</P>

<P>Who shall protect you in my house but I? My Lord, she is under my protection; and if you offer to take her from me, I'll exert the authority of a husband, and look her up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Norland, [to Miss Wooburn.]</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you been delud∣ed hither, and wish to leave the place with me? Tell me in∣stantly, that I may know how to act.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Wooburn.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, I am ready to go with you, but—</P>

<P>—But you find she is inclined to stay; and do have some compassion upon two people that are so fond of you.</P>

<P>I cannot give you joy for envy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I do not know whether you will envy me much when you see my spouse—I cannot say she was exactly my choice. However, she is my wife now; and that is a name so endearing, I think I love her better since the ceremo∣ny has been performed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray when did it take place?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>This moment. We are now returning from a friend's house, where we have been joined; and I felt myself so hap∣py, I could not pass Sir Robert's door, without calling to tell him of my good fortune.—And, as I see your lady here, Sir Robert, I guess you are just married too; and so I'll hand my wife out of the carriage, and introduce the two brides to each other.</P>

<P>My Relation! Dear Madam, by what strange turn of fortune do I see you become a wife?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Harmony, it is a weakness I acknowledge; but you can never want an excuse for me, when you call to mind "the scarcity of provisions."</P>

<P>Mr. Harmony, I have loved her ever since you told me she spoke so well of me behind my back.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Norland.</SPEAKER>
<P>I agree with you, Mr. Solus, that this is a most excellent proof of a person's disposition; and in consi∣deration, Sir Robert, that, throughout all our many disa∣greements, you have still preserved a respect for my character in my absence, I do at last say to that Lady, she has my consent to trust you again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>And she will trust me; I see it in her smiles, Oh! unexpected ecstacy!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Harmony,</HI> [<HI>holding a letter in his hand.</HI>]</SPEAKER>
<P>Amidst those bright prospects of joy which this company are contemplat∣ing, I come to announce an event that ought to cloud the splendour of the horizon.—A worthy, but an ill fated man, whom ye were all acquainted with, has just breathed his last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Norland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you mean the husband of my daughter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you mean my n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hew?</P>

<P>Is it my friend?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>And my old acquaintance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did Mr. Irwin in possess all those titles you have given him, Gentlemen? Was he your son? <STAGE>[To Lord <HI>Nor∣land</HI>]</STAGE> Your nephew? <STAGE>[To <HI>Solus</HI>]</STAGE> Your friend? <STAGE>[To Mr.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>He did know it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>Still more strange that he should die for want, and not apply to any of you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! Die for want in London! Starve in the midst of plenty!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; but he seized that plenty, where law, where honour, where every social and religious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie forbad the trespass; and in punishment of the guilt, he became his own executioner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Norland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then my daughter is wretched, and her boy involved in his father's infamy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>The fear of his ghost haunting me, will disturb the joys of my married life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mrs. Placid, Mrs. Placid, my complying with your injunctions in respect of Mr. Irwin, will make me mi∣serable forever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Wooburn.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish he had applied to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>And as I refused him his request, I would give half my estate he had <HI>not</HI> applied to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>And a man who always spoke so well of you all behind your backs!—I dare say, that, in his dying moments, there was not one of you whom he did not praise for some virtue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no—when he was dying he would be more careful of what he said.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Norland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Robert, good day. Settle your marri∣age as you and your Lady shall approve; you have my good wishes. But my spirits have received too great a shock to be capable of any other impression at present.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, Mrs. Solus, let me hand you into your carri∣age to your company; but excuse my going home with you. My spirits have received too great a shock, for me to be capa∣ble of any other impression at present.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony, stopping Solus.]</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[Goes hastily to <HI>Solus,</HI> and leads him to <HI>Irwin</HI>; then to Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Placid.</HI>]</STAGE> And now that I see you all reconciled, I can say, there are not two enemies in the whole circle of my acquaintance, that I have not within these three days made friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, Harmony; for we should never have known half how well we all love one another, if you had not told us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, my good friends, notwithstanding the merit you may attribute to me, I have one most tre∣mendous fault; and it weighs so heavy on my conscience, I would confess what it is, but that you might hereafter call my veracity in question.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Harmony, without a fault, you would not be a proper companion for any of us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Norland.</SPEAKER>
<P>And while a man like you, may have (among so many virtues) some faults; let us hope there may be found in each of us, (among all our faults) some virtues.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my Lord,—and notwithstanding all our faults, it is my sincere wish, that the world may speak well of us—behind our backs.</P>

<L>To this decree, our dearest friends must bow</L>
<L>One is too careless, one is too correct.</L>
<L>All, save our our own sweet self, has some defect:</L>

<L>"To aid distress, would share his last poor guinea,</L>

<L>Lady Doll Primrose says to Lady Sly,</L>
<L>"You know Miss Tidlikins? Yes—looks awry—</L>
<L>"She's going to be married,—that won't mend it;—</L>

<LG>
<L>If such the general blame that all await,</L>

<L>Some will dislike the saucy truths she teaches,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>These playful pictures of discordant life,</L>
<L>We bring to combat discontent and strife,</L>
<L>And, by the force of contrast, sweetly prove</L>
<L>The charm that waits on fond and faithful love;</L>
<L>When suited years, and pliant tempers join;</L>
<L>And the heart glows with energy divine,</L>
<L>As the lov'd offspring of the happy pair</L>
<L>Oft climb the knee, the envied kiss to share.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! may the noble zeal, the glorious stand</L>
<L>Which once preserv'd this independant land,</L>
<L>Secure to every breast, with glad increase,</L>
<L>The heartfelt blessings of domestic peace!</L>
