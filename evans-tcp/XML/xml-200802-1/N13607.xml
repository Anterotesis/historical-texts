<Q><HI>But none of these Things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my Course with joy, and the Ministry which I have received of the</HI> LORD JESUS, <HI>to testify the Gospel of the Grace of</HI> GOD.</Q>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR CHARGE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS Sabbath compleats a HALF CENTURY since I was ordained a Pastor, and upon the laying on the hands of the Presbytery, solemnly vested and charged with the care of souls in this place.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="017182_0004_0FA073764FE4D518"/>
WHOEVER has just views of eternal things must be sensible, that in the name of Christ to minister to im∣mortals, who are so interested in those things, is the most important employ in the world. Accordingly the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> a minister of the Lord, makes fre∣quent mention of the matter of his charge, as lying with the greatest weight on his mind. And however imperfect and unprofitable I have been in the discharge of my office, I think I can heartily join him therein. He had his peculiar trials, but they moved him not; for he counted not his life dear unto himself, in the dis∣charge of his arduous trust, if so be he might finish his course with joy. These last words abstractly, contain matter equally concerning to all christians; which viewed in its solemn importance, is enough to silence every amusement, and command the most entire atten∣tion of man. But connected with the following clause, they redouble their energy upon that order of men, here personated by the venerable Apostle.—He receiv∣ed commission to minister in matters relative to pre∣cious souls and things eternal—things weighty enough to crush the shoulders of Angels, and affect their minds with the deepest sollicitude; as the honour of GOD, and the salvation of men, were jointly and so greatly con∣cerned therein. An affecting sense of this (as the time drew nigh in which he must give an account to the Lord Jesus Christ) constrains him, as in my text to say, <HI>Neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might
<PB N="7" REF="017182_0005_0FA073770B6845D8"/>
finish my course with joy, and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the Gospel of the grace of</HI> GOD.</P>
<P>OH how ponderous; how weighty the care of souls, on the hearts of faithful ministers! St. <HI>Paul</HI> had such lively apprehensions of this, that death, in whatever form it threaten him, moves him not, if these two things may but happily conspire in his favour, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that his course might end with joy, and the Lord Jesus ac∣count him faithful in the ministry which he had re∣ceived of him. The summary of which is, to testify the gospel of the grace of GOD. To do this, is evan∣gelically and faithfully to preach the divine word, not shunning to declare the whole counsel of GOD. Conscious of having so done, the Apostle is emboldened to make his appeal to the elders of the churches in the words succeeding the text. As a dying man, whose face he expected they would see no more, he calls them to record, that he was pure from the blood of all men; not having shunned to declare unto them the whole counsel of GOD. Thus he appeals to their consciences for witness, that without reservation, in its fulness—he had set forth the glorious gospel of GOD's free grace, as he had been directed by the re∣velation of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>HAD he failed of this—had he legalized the gospel—had he shifted it off from the proper basis, well might his confidence desert him: But he had accom∣plished his errand;—had sincerely testified the gospel
<PB N="8" REF="017182_0006_0FA07377CCBA50E8"/>
of the grace of GOD. Hence we behold the blessed Apostle possessed of that settled prospect of finishing his course with joy; which indeed is the highest attain∣ment of a Saint this side Heaven.</P>
<P>IF we take a look at this world, and the course of ungodly men, lo! all that is therein is putrid and pass∣ing, and what shall their end be! But we behold the coursers to Zion upon their high places; and how just∣ly do they esteem all things on earth as dung and dross, if they may attain to please GOD, and be accepted of a glorious Christ, in the great day of his appearing.</P>
<P>IN further meditation on the sacred passage before us, I would lead the minds of the audience to consider;</P>
<P>THAT every man here in this life hath his course.</P>
<P>THAT this his course will certainly be finished, in a short time, either with joy or sorrow.</P>
<P>THAT it is of infinite importance to all, so to con∣duct in life, as that they may finish their course with joy.</P>
<P>AND especially ministers of the gospel, whose great and main business it is, to testify the gospel of the grace of GOD.</P>
<P>THAT every man here in this life hath his course, will not be doubted; but briefly to attend to it.</P>
<P>THE word <HI>course</HI> intimates that series of actions which pertains to any person. Every Agent then has his course. A man's calling is his course; whether se∣cular, civil or sacred; and he that hath no good calling, or employment, necessarily has a bad one. That
<PB N="9" REF="017182_0007_0FA073788DD5E690"/>
which a man mainly busieth himself about, is eminent∣ly his course. He that is engaged for Heaven, em∣ploys his thoughts—fixes his mind, and bends his stu∣dies to know how he may please GOD, and answer the great intent of his being.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jerem. xxx. 21.</NOTE> <HI>Who is this that engageth his heart to approach unto me? saith the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is the grand object of every good man's care and study.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">I Cor. ix. 24.</NOTE> <HI>So run that ye may obtain, i. e.</HI> use dili∣gence, care and constancy in the christian course, that you may obtain the prize of glory.</P>
<P>HE that is engaged for the world bends his course that way—mediates, converses and labours to obtain the enjoyments of it—makes that his ultimate end. Directly opposed to this, is that caution of our blessed Saviour;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">John. vi. 27.</NOTE> <HI>Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of Man shall give unto you.</HI></P>
<P>MAN is a busy creature, formed for action: And as there is here no continuing city, so his life is call∣ed a race, and the manner in which he practiseth his course, whether it be good or evil. Which of these is ours, is determined by the temper of our hearts. Thus are we taught by our Lord,<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Matt. xii. 35.</NOTE> <HI>A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things; and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.</HI></P>
<P>THE great author of the world at first placed man in
<PB N="10" REF="017182_0008_0FA073794C59D5B0"/>
a very happy situation—with his face toward Hea∣ven, and his heart ingeniously disposed to holiness in life and all manner of conversation: But his high hand∣ed rebellion has turned his face from GOD, and plunged him into a labyrinth of wretchedness. Hence that divine order from the Lord of all,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. xii. 33.</NOTE> <HI>Make the tree good.</HI> This neglected, men will inevitably walk in the way of their wicked minds, until they are filled with their own devices.</P>
<P>BUT I proceed to observe, that whatever be our course, it will be finished in a short time, either with joy or sorrow.</P>
<P>THIS demands our serious thoughtfulness. Death is irresistibly ravaging through the four quarters of the world: And <HI>Adam'</HI>s sons, countless, are daily drop∣ing off the globe:—Yea, the earth itself must soon come to a terrible dissolution.—All things here below are temporary and transient—every courser must soon arrive at his term—his days are as a shadow—he con∣tinueth for a little while and then vanisheth away.</P>
<P>VAST and infinite things do nearly and most inti∣mately concern us all; for we stand hard by the shore, and as at the very doors of eternity.—Were man's days an hundred years on the earth;—still he has here no abiding place:—The end is by and by:—Time wings its way with speed, and the extremity of our course is just at hand.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Job. xvi. 22.</NOTE> <HI>When a few years are come I shall go the way whence I shall not return.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="017182_0009_0FA0737A0A494530"/>
OUR days on earth must indeed be finished soon, because our natures are so very feeble and subject to decay, that upon the least touch they totter to a fall: Our sinews are not as brass, nor our bones as iron: We continually feel our natures mortal.—Every pain and every ach in our bones or flesh, is none other than death knocking at the door—Heralds proclaim∣ing the approach of the king of terrors:—Our days are few—our race is short.—'As an eagle hasteth to her prey, so we swiftly to our end.'</P>
<P>O WITH what solemnity should our thoughts me∣ditate the grand remove from this inch of time, to end∣less eternity!</P>
<P>IF, passing from this world of inconsistencies and sor∣rows, we make proportionate advance towards the mansions in our father's house, the prospect is delight∣fully animating and joyful.—But otherwise, every scene beyond time must open with amazing terror: For if GOD's word may be credited, as our course is, so will be our end.</P>
<P>IT is most evident, and yet surprizing, that multi∣tudes of men, posting to eternity, are altogether care∣less and unconcerned about the course they steer. Ma∣ny, alas! very many run a mad career—the danger of endless ruin hangs on every moment.—But a happy number there are, who being influenced by the spirit of GOD, to faith and love, hope and confidence, upon a good foundation, shall be safe in the arms of immutability—Remove in peace to partake of the fruit of their hope
<PB N="12" REF="017182_0010_0FA0737D38364A10"/>
—the salvation of their souls—an immortal fullness of joy.</P>
<P>THE Holy Ghost is the mover of their course—God's word their compass, and their haven, realms of bliss; where mortality shall be swallowed up of life<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. ii. 10.</NOTE>.—<HI>Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</HI> Such are they who follow the lamb of GOD—they have hope in their death—well may they tri∣umph in their desolution. They behold the mark for the prize—rich prize, just at hand.</P>
<P><Q>O Christian, that movest thy course aright, though briars and thorns were with thee on every side; yet thou mayest be joyful in passing the rugged—gloomy vales, for that thy sorrows shall soon have an end, and thine expectations shall not be cut off. And will it not joy thee, when arrived to thy father's house, to review thy labours in watchings and warrings, the suf∣ferings of Christ mystical, which were yet behind, having in part been filled up in thy pains? Now when thy tears, kept in his bottle, shall be poured out for a testimony in thy favour; Oh then! How exquisite the joy! When the Redeemer shall bid thee welcome, and wipe away all tears from thine eyes forever!</Q> This, to the disciples of the Lamb, as well as the commence∣ment of wretchedness and despair to the wicked, is near—very near and certain.</P>
<P>THEREFORE, with the strictest propriety is it assert∣ed—that so to conduct in this life, as to finish their course with joy, is of infinite importance to all.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="017182_0011_0FA0737DCEAC0EC8"/>
INDEED, my brethren, it should be the great con∣cern and business of life, to study and learn how to die in peace. No man is possessed of complete felicity on earth.</P>
<P>IT was the saying of an antient Philosopher,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Solont</HI></NOTE> that he could not pronounce a man happy, until he knew how he died. And by divine revelation, we are more abundantly certified of this truth; that he only is hap∣py, who is found ready to depart and die, when his Lord shall call for him.</P>
<P>'HE that secures the good part, and reaches the true evidence of his heavenly father's love; a ponderous crown of life is his sure and everlasting portion—He knows his Redeemer liveth, and as he liveth in Christ, so death appears without a sting; and his soul is full of longings to depart and be with him.'</P>
<P>OH! thrice happy man, whose lamp burns bright at the midnight of death.</P>
<P>IT is without dispute, that the prize of our high call∣ing in Jesus Christ, is infinitely worthy of the intense care and strenuous pursuit of every man. Surprizing∣ly strange therefore, that the generality of mankind should be so indifferent to, and so negligent of, the in∣valuable part!—Passing swiftly to worlds of joy or woe, that they should be so entirely thoughtless to which they go! Oh that the spirit of the living GOD might effectually move upon their hearts; that, while time continues, they might awake from their delusive slumbers—arise from the dead, and become living, ac∣tive
<PB N="14" REF="017182_0012_0FA0737E8CC26B20"/>
instruments of GOD's glory, and finally partakers of the happiness which flows from his presence and ap∣probation.</P>
<P>Is it possible, that any one (realizing his immortali∣ty) should not desire to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Numb. xxiii. 10.</NOTE> <HI>Die the death of the righteous, and shat his last and might be like his?</HI></P>
<P>BUT what are the necessary prerequisites to a joyful exit? In brief, they are such as sanctification by the di∣vine spirit—or a renewal and change of the temper of our hearts—or a being born again. As we all have partook of the corruption of nature by the first <HI>Adam,</HI> which exposes to complete wretchedness; so every man, to become an heir of eternal glory, must partake of a renovation of mind, according to the image of the second <HI>Adam.</HI></P>
<P>THE blissful Heaven of GOD's presence, can be no place for the unsanctified and unholy.—<HI>The carnal mind is enmity to</HI> GOD. Hence the absolute necessity of that sanctification by the spirit of GOD; which conforms us to his divine likeness, and influences to the exercises of those graces, and the performance of those duties, essential to the Christian character, that we may finish our course with joy. <HI>Without holiness no man shall see the Lord.</HI> We shall therefore find the necessity of repentence towards GOD, and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; love to the divine character, perfections, laws and government; and benevolence to creatures; accompanied, with increasing affection to things spiritual, which are above; and proportionate
<PB N="15" REF="017182_0013_0FA0737F4F9FF060"/>
indifference to, and disengagedness from the less im∣portant, trifling and comparatively small objects and enjoyments of the present world.</P>
<P>ACCOMPANIED, with prayerfulness, watchfulness, activity, diligence and perseverance in the discharge of the duties of life—duties which respect GOD, our neighbour and ourselves. We must do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly before GOD, &amp;c. in order to enter into the kingdom of Heaven; which seat of ex∣alted happiness will not be indulged us, on account of any deeds in us, meriting GOD's favour, but solely for the prevailing merits of Jesus Christ, who is the pur∣chaser, grand medium, and end of our salvation.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH none will obtain eternal life for, or on account of, the exercise and performance of Christian graces and duties; yet all, who from right principles obey, shall through the infinite mediator, finish their course with joy, and obtain a happy admission to glory: When, those of a contrary character, who practise in∣iquity, shall be miserably excluded the realms of blissful immortality.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xxi. 7, 8.</NOTE> <HI>He that overcometh shall inherit all things, and I will be his</HI> GOD <HI>and he shall be my son. But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and socerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.</HI> Whoever, therefore, would wish to have his sun serene and bright, (when the dark curtains of death
<PB N="16" REF="017182_0014_0FA073800CAC3788"/>
are gathering about him) and his eternity blessed, let him be holy in heart, in life, and in all manner of con∣versation. This, without a laboured proof, appears to be of infinite importance to every man: But parti∣cularly and very especially.</P>
<P>TO Ministers of the Gospel, whose great and main business it is, to testify the gospel of the grace of GOD, <HI>i. e.</HI> the gospel wherein the grace of GOD is published to a fallen, perishing world.</P>
<P>As the doctrines of this gospel are infinitely concern∣ing to men, so the genuine and faithful preaching them is here considered by St. <HI>Paul</HI> as a matter of the high∣est importance to himself, and others in the ministry; a number of which, he now had an interview with. He intimates to them, that to bear a due testimony to the doctrines of GOD's free grace (for which he was aware, the legalizing Jews would furiously persecute him) was much dearer to him than life. Therefore, he was determined to publish the grace of GOD, bear witness to the truth of it, and prosecute his important errand, although it should prove to the peril of his life.</P>
<P>THE grace of GOD here mentioned, intimates the free and eternal love of GOD exhibited in the way of the new covenant.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the tenor of the first covenant, fallen man must necessarily relinquish all claim to the favour of GOD: The plan of the new covenant, on which a∣lone, man can become a partaker of forfeited happi∣ness, is wholly founded in grace. The gift of GOD's
<PB N="17" REF="017182_0015_0FA07380CCCEC730"/>
dear son to a ruined world, is entirely the result of pure, free, rich and sovereign grace. Herein are displayed the astonishing wonders of the father's love; giving the immaculate son, to become a sacrifice to divine justice, that rebels might be redeemed to GOD.</P>
<P>As the purchase was free, so is the bestowment of that grace which bringeth salvation—the grace of GOD.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. i. 9.</NOTE> <HI>Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus be∣fore the world began.</HI></P>
<P>FURTHER, the grace of GOD intends the free impu∣tation of Christ's righteousness; on account of which believers are reputed righteous in the sight of GOD.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 26.</NOTE> <HI>To declare I say at this time his righteousness; that he might be just, and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN, by the grace of GOD is designed the work of the spirit in believers.</P>
<P>ALL the righteousness that is wrought in them, or by them, is the fruit of grace. From first to last, from the foundation to the topstone of our salvation, it be∣comes us to cry, grace—grace unto it. Yet the assert∣ers of the free grace of GOD wherein we stand, fre∣quently meet with unreasonable treatment. The pride of the depraved heart can by no means relish those soul humbling doctrines of the gospel, which place the sinner at GOD's foot, as helpless and misera∣ble in himself: Which bind him to the methods of
<PB N="18" REF="017182_0016_0FA073818FD75410"/>
sovereign grace, and shut him up to the faith of the gos∣pel for salvation: Which deny to the creature the honor of procuring his happiness, and attribute the whole glo∣ry to Jehovah: Which bespeak the whole oeconomy of redemption, the wonderous work of GOD. Hence, at the present day, such as testify the free grace of GOD, are by many, deemed stupid and irrational—treated with scorn and contempt, as though babblers and fools.</P>
<P>BUT, as all religion which is evangelical and genu∣ine, stands upon this basis (the grace of GOD) so it must be insisted on and testified. This is the gospel which must be preached to every creature, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear. Blessed be GOD, it is well attested, and therefore may be boldly testified.</P>
<P>THE gospel makes full proof, that being justified freely by his grace, we have peace with GOD, through our Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>THEIR'S is another gospel than that of GOD our sa∣viour, which is not founded on the free grace of GOD. This is the only way in which our restoration to holi∣ness and happiness can possibly be accomplished. Wherefore, for a minister of Jesus Christ, to believe, preach, practise and testify this gospel of the grace of GOD, is the only way to fulful his ministry, to save himself and them that hear him.</P>
<P>MINISTERS of the gospel are stiled Stewards; and as they are by Jesus entrusted with the charge of his
<PB N="19" REF="017182_0017_0FA073824C3C5AD0"/>
oracles, ordinances, and the souls of men; to him they must give an account of their stewardship; and how aggravatedly terrible their doom, if they corrupt the word of GOD! conceal divine truth! daub with un∣tempered mortar! few pillows under arm-holes! dis∣order the peace of the church! waste their time! abuse talents!—or misimprove opportunities, to sin∣ful or insignificant purposes!</P>
<P>On the other hand, should they faithfully keep the trust committed to them: Should they sincerely serve the Lord Jesus, in a busy, careful, pleasing attention to the matters of his family—the great affairs of his church and kingdom; how joyfully may they expect to finish their course, and the ministry which they have received of the Lord! How rich will be the re∣wards of divine grace upon them, who have faithfully testified the gospel of the grace of GOD! They shall be graciously owned of their Lord, in the great day of his appearing; and with consummate glory enter into their master's joy. All important then is it to them, that they so conduct in life—in their ministry, as that approbation and joy may attend the completion of both.</P>
<P>TO CLOSE THE SUBJECT—</P>
<P><HI>My dear Friends,</HI></P>
<P>IS it not suitable, while reflecting on what has been offered, and may it not be very advantageous, in an impartial, critical, solemn manner, to examine our∣selves, and prove whether we be in the faith? of that
<PB N="20" REF="017182_0018_0FA073830A545538"/>
happy number, who are not greatly moved at any of the trying scenes of time, but prepared to finish their course with joy?</P>
<P>IT can not be otherwise, than a most concerning, im∣portant, interesting affair, to know how we have enter∣tained the gracious offers and tenders of the gospel of the grace of GOD—whether in vain. Recollect that particu∣lar declaration of GOD our saviour;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John iii. 19, 20, 21.</NOTE> <HI>This is the con∣demnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For every one that doeth evil, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth truth, cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in</HI> GOD.</P>
<P>THE gospel of GOD's free grace hath been preached and testified to us: To reflect then, that we have slight∣ed, contemned, or neglected it, may well strike us with fear and trembling.</P>
<P>LET us all call ourselves to account, and put the so∣lemn query, how we have believed and practised;—impartially enquire what effect the gospel of divine grace hath had on our hearts and lives; what we have been doing in the world; and whether, we are now bending our course.</P>
<P>IT will soon terminate in joy or sorrow—What are the paths in which we walk? What is the main study and business of life? He that believeth, and endureth
<PB N="21" REF="017182_0019_0FA07383CC396500"/>
to the end, the same shall be saved: He that be∣lieveth not, but practiseth iniquity, shall be damned—must finish his course in misery.</P>
<P>LET every one, critically search his heart, and try his own ways; knowing that in a very short time, his stewardship will be ended, and his present state of trial be resolved into a state of eternal retribution.</P>
<P>WHEREFORE, let us behave as men, who are truly concerned for the honour of GOD and the welfare of our immortal souls; and who have received the grace of GOD not in vain, but to holiness of life. And by all means be careful, that we make full proof of the reality of our high calling in Christ Jesus, by all gos∣pel obedience.</P>
<P>IF this wisdom have a residence in our hearts; if this understanding be pleasant to our souls, it shall pre∣serve and keep us.</P>
<P>NOW is the time, if we would work the work of GOD: Now is the accepted time, behold, now is the day of salvation; and on the wise improvement of it, much depends, even our happiness in death, and forever.</P>
<P>LET us look well to this, that we believingly, hum∣bly and thankfully entertain the testimony of GOD's free grace, as manifestly exhibited, in the gospel of his dear son; wherein rich and full provision is made for the happiness and glory of the most unworthy and help∣less of the human race. Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness: Who rely on the in∣fluence
<PB N="22" REF="017182_0020_0FA0738491B13C60"/>
and grace of GOD's spirit, to direct, strengthen and conform them to the image of his son: That growing up into his likeness, they might be to the praise of him who hath called them: The happy trophies of redeeming love.</P>
<P>LET it be the solemn concern of every soul—to de∣ny themselves—take up the cross and follow after Je∣sus Christ.—To deny, all ungodliness and every world∣ly lust—to live soberly, righteously and godly in this present evil world:—that they may evidence the vir∣tues of him who invites them to his kingdom and glo∣ry. As a means of incitement to this, let us keep in view the end of our course—the solemn account we are to give, to the Judge of quick and dead, of every thought and word, and all the actions done here in the body—The fearful situation of a Christless sinner, at the verge of life, having rejected the counsel of GOD against his own soul. Had he not refused the gracious tenders of reconciliation, pardon and peace, he might have been a saint in Heaven: But he would not come to Christ that he might have life: And what can he now expect, but to suffer the just rewards of his folly and madness! O wretched his state!</P>
<P>ON the other hand how unspeakable the joy, of a child of GOD, with clear and ravishing views of the better world—sensible that he is returning to his father's house—the mansions of bliss made ready by the di∣vine Jesus for all his followers!</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="017182_0021_0FA073872CE9F490"/>
O THRICE happy!—eternally happy man!—passing the dark valley of the shadow of death, he fears no evil—he clasps, in the affections of his heart, the true saviour of men; who has become his strength, light, life and salvation.</P>
<P>AND now, as the gospel ministry is the most solemn, important and interesting employment; with what un∣speakable weight must it ly upon the hearts of those who are faithfully engaged therein, that they may be pure from the blood of all men, not shunning to declare the whole counsel of GOD!</P>
<P>THEIR special business (as has been observed) is to publish salvation—to testify the gospel of the grace of GOD—to put away false confidences from the proud hearts of man—to open blind eyes, and turn men (if possible) from their courses of ungodliness—to paint and present virtue and piety, in the most amiable co∣lours to the mind, as grounded in the love of GOD, and the divine constraints of free and sovereign grace.</P>
<P>HAVING performed so arduous an employ—so im∣portant for advancing the divine glory, and so condu∣cive to human happiness—Having obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful; with what composure, chear∣fulness and joy, may such an one finish his course? Saint <HI>Paul</HI> speaking his sense of this saith,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iv. 6, 7, 8.</NOTE> <HI>I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith. Henceforth there is laid up for
<PB N="24" REF="017182_0022_0FA073878EF9C168"/>
me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righte∣ous Judge shall give me at that day: And not to me on∣ly, but unto all them also who love his appearing.</HI></P>
<P>SUFFER me to add here, that it should be often thought of, and may well serve to animate the zeal of a Minister, and excite the close, affectionate attention of a people, to consider that they must shortly part; see the faces, and hear the voices of each other, no more, for ever. Ministers are successively finishing their course.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Zech. i. 5.</NOTE> <HI>Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for ever?</HI> Sensible of this; with what sollicitude should Ministers exert themselves to fulfil their trust?</P>
<P>VOCAL utterance, must soon exchange for silence in death.</P>
<P>MY dear people, as this sabbath closeth a half cen∣tury, since I have had the care of souls in this place, and been speaking to you in the name of the Lord; so neither you nor I can expect, but that (as this is the 76th year of my life) the day of my departure draweth nigh, when I shall have finished my testimony, and, as an Ambassador of the Saviour, speak to you no more.</P>
<P>REALIZING myself on the edge of time, I have this comfortable review of my ministerial course (whe∣ther successful or unsuccessful) that I have not <HI>shunned to declare unto you the whole counsel of</HI> GOD. That I have sincerely endeavoured to serve the glorious cause
<PB N="25" REF="017182_0023_0FA073885F680DE8"/>
of my dear Lord and Master Jesus Christ: And if pos∣sible to gain every soul to the knowledge and love of the truth: I have laboured to testify the gospel of the grace of GOD; and have been urging upon you the as∣surances of the fullness of grace in Christ Jesus, for every one, willing to accept the offered salvation.</P>
<P>IT is true I have been with you in much weakness and fear: I gratefully remember your kindnesses: I feel the warmest desires for your salvation. But alas! how little attention is paid to the all-important concerns of religion: It affects me with bitter grief to observe the apparent decay of it—That so few are truly con∣verting to GOD.</P>
<P>IT would give me surprizing joy, to behold the symptoms of the grace of GOD taking place in all your hearts; and true piety reviving amongst you, once more before I die.</P>
<P>I CAN never forget my vehement struggles at the throne of grace, just before I was here ordained a Pastor, lest I should fail of success among this people; when GOD was pleased to afford some comfortable prospects: And to my particular satisfaction, within five years 81 members were added to this church (at that time 49 in number) although the people here were then but comparatively few.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The people of Sutton embodied and acted as a ci∣vil society on December 3d, 1718, for the first time; although a few families had inhabited it some time be∣fore. November 27th, 1720, the Rev. John McKinstry was ordained their Pastor, and September 2d, 1728, was dismissed from his pastoral relation to them.</NOTE> After this, we had fa∣mily
<PB N="26" REF="017182_0024_0FA073890B792628"/>
meetings; praying societies in several parts of the town: And within ten years after, an hundred and eighty members more were added to the Church of Christ in this place.—For thirty-five years last past, there have joined in full communion with us, but 156. Of which number,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the whole 417, and 49 before of the Church.</NOTE> some have been dismissed and commended to the fellowship of other churches,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">About an hundred and sixty have been dismissed and commended, chiefly to Grafton, Sutton parish, Douglass, Royalston and Cornish.</NOTE> and many are deceased and gone to their long home.</P>
<P>IN the course of my ministry, I have baptized a considerable number<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Adults 40—Infants 1210.</NOTE>—and oh, that they may all be found at Christ's right hand, in the great day of his appearing.</P>
<P>MAY the number of them who fear GOD, and work righteousness who profess and practise godliness, be greatly increased, and the glory of the Lord be mani∣fest in the midst of his people.</P>
<P>MY soul longs for the first ripe fruits—Once more to see old and young engaged in working out their sal∣vation, and joining themselves to the Lord in an ever∣lasting covenant.</P>
<P>AT present, it is a very dark day with the Church of GOD; even as if the end of all things was near at hand. For<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Luke xviii. 8.</NOTE> <HI>when the son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?</HI></P>

MY dear hearers, as I have often told you, of late; so I am now constrained to say, without a speedy re∣vival of religion—attention to sacred things—reforma∣tion of the minds and manners of men; we have rea∣son, the greatest reason to expect ruin. If this declin∣ing age will not more diligently hearken to the gospel of the grace of God—he will remove their candlestick out of its place.</P>
<P>WHO then? O who of you are on the Lord's side, and determined, in prayer, to seek the face of the migh∣ty GOD of <HI>Jacob?</HI> The gates of Zion tremble.—New-England never saw such a day as this—The glory is departed.</P>
<P>THE United, American States, this moment are in a critical situation. Have we not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> relied on an arm of flesh? Have we not put too great confi∣dence in men and means? None hath an arm like GOD. Why therefore do we restrain prayer before him? O ye who fear the Lord, let us unite, and socially, and often supplicate favour of the GOD of Heaven. And will not the Lord hearken and reform his people? For when Zion travailed, she brought forth children. Be the bones ever so dry, the quickning spirit of the Almighty can animate and raise them up: And then shall Heaven and earth exalt his praise.</P>
<P>THE day is gloomy—troubles, distresses and trials are on every side. We <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in fear—in jeopardy—in war—a war pregnant with the fate of thousands—on the event of which much depends—the rights and li∣berties
<PB N="28" REF="017182_0026_0FA0738A8CD2F198"/>
of America. But could I discern the clear to∣kens of piety, and of a revival of religion, my joy would be great.</P>
<P>WITH respect to external changes, I think I can tru∣ly say—none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry which I have re∣ceived of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of GOD.</P>
