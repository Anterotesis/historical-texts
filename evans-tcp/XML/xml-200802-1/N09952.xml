<HEAD>AN APPEAL TO THE PUBLIC, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>INASMUCH as there appears to us a real need of such an appeal, we would previ∣ously offer a few thoughts concerning the general nature of liberty and government, and then shew wherein it appears to us, that our religious rights are encroached upon in this land.</P>
<P>It is supposed by multitudes, that in submit∣ting to government we give up some part of our liberty, because they imagine that there is something in their nature incompatible with each other. But the word of truth plainly shews, that man first lost his freedom by breaking over the rules of government; and that those who
<PB N="4" REF="012654_0003_0F8BBF656F02CE28"/>
now speak great <HI>swelling words</HI> about <HI>liberty,</HI> while they <HI>despise government,</HI> are themselves <HI>ser∣vants of corruption.</HI> What a dangerous error, yea, what a root of all evil then must it be, for men to imagine that there is any thing in the nature of true government that interferes with true and full liberty! A grand cause of this e∣vil is, ignorance of what we are, and where we are; for did we view things in their true light, it would appear to be as absurd and dangerous, for us to aspire after any thing beyond our ca∣pacity, or out of the rule of our duty, as it would for the frog to swell till he bursts himself in try∣ing to get as big as the ox, or for a beast or fowl to dive into the fishes element till they drown themselves. <HI>Godliness with contentment is great gain:</HI> But they that <HI>will</HI> take a contrary course <HI>fall into temptation, and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which</HI> DROWN <HI>men in destruction and perdition.</HI> 1 Tim. 6. 6, 9.</P>
<P>The true liberty of man is, to know, obey and enjoy his Creator, and to do all the good unto, and enjoy all the happiness with and in his fel∣low-creatures that he is capable of; in order to which the law of love was written in his heart, which carries in it's nature union and benevo∣lence to Being in general, and to each being in particular, according to it's nature and excellen∣cy, and to it's relation and connexion to and with the supreme Being, and ourselves. Each rational soul, as he is a part of the whole system of rational beings, so it was and is, both his du∣ty and his liberty to regard the good of the whole in all his actions. To love ourselves, and
<PB N="5" REF="012654_0004_0F8BBF691A289438"/>
truly to seek our own welfare, is both our liber∣ty and our indispensible duty; but the conceit that man could advance either his honor or hap∣piness, by disobedience instead of obedience, was first injected by the <HI>father of lies,</HI> and all such conceits ever since are as false as he is.</P>
<P>Before man imagined that submission to go∣vernment, and acting strictly by rule was con∣finement, and that breaking over those bounds would enlarge his knowledge and happiness, how clear were his ideas! (even so as to give proper names to every creature) and how great was his honor and pleasure! But no sooner did he transgress, than instead of enjoying the bold∣ness of innocency, and the liberties of paradise, he sneaks away to hide himself; and instead of clear and just ideas, he adopted that master of all absurdities (which his children follow to this day) of thinking to hide from OMNICIENCY, and of trying to deceive HIM who knows every thing! Instead of good and happiness, he felt evil, guilt and misery; and in the room of con∣cord was wrangling, both against his Creator and his fellow-creature, even so that she who was be∣fore loved as his <HI>own flesh,</HI> he now <HI>accuses</HI> to the great Judge. By which it appears, that the no∣tion of man's gaining any dignity or liberty by refusing an intire submission to government, was so delusive, that instead of it's advancing him to be <HI>as Gods,</HI> it sunk him down into a way of act∣ing like the beasts and like the devil! the beasts are actuated by their senses and inclinations, and the devil pursues his designs by deceit and vio∣lence. With malicious reflections upon God,
<PB N="6" REF="012654_0005_0F8BBF6944C279B0"/>
and flattering pretences to man, he drew him down to gratify his eyes and his taste with for∣bidden fruit: and he had no sooner revolted from the authority of heaven, than the beauty and order of his family was broken; he turns accuser against the wife of his bosom, his first son murders the next, and then lies to his Maker to conceal it; and that lying murderer's posteri∣ty were the first who broke over the order of marriage which God had instituted; and things proceeded from bad to worse, till all flesh had corrupted his way, and the earth was filled with violence, so that they could no longer be borne with, but by a just vengeance were all swept a∣way, only one family.</P>
<P>Yet all this did not remove the dreadful dis∣temper from man's nature, for the great Ruler of the universe directly after the flood, gave this as one reason why he would not bring such ano∣ther while the earth remains, namely, <HI>For the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth;</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and 6▪ 13, 15, and 8. 21.</NOTE> so that if he was to drown them as often as they deserved it, one deluge must follow another con∣tinually. Observe well where the distemper lies; evil imaginations have usurped the place of reason and a well informed judgment, and hold them in such bondage, that instead of be∣ing governed by those noble faculties, they are put to the horrid drugery of <HI>seeking out inventions,</HI> for the gratification of <HI>fleshly lusts, which war a∣gainst the soul;</HI> and to guard against having these worst of all enemies detected and subdued. Enemies which are so far from being God's crea∣tures,
<PB N="7" REF="012654_0006_0F8BBF6990DD2F38"/>
that strictly speaking, they have no being at all in themselves, only are the privation of his creatures well-being; therefore sin with it's off∣spring death, will, as to those who are saved, be <HI>swallowed up in victory.</HI> Sin is an enemy both to God and man, which was begotten by satan, and was conceived and brought forth by man; for lust when it is conceived bringeth forth sin, and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Eccl. 7. 29. 1 Pet. 2. 11. Jam. 1. 14, 15.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now how often have we been told, that he is not a freeman but a slave, whose person and goods are not at his own but anothers disposal? And to have foreigners come and riot at our ex∣pence and in the fruit of our labours, has of∣ten been represented to be worse than death. And should the higher powers appear to deal with temporal oppressors according to their de∣serts, it would seem strange indeed, if those who have suffered intolerably by them, should employ all their art and power to conceal them, and so to prevent their being brought to justice! But how is our world filled with such madness con∣cerning spiritual tyrants! How far have pride and infidelity, covetousness and luxury, yea de∣ceit and cruelty, those foriegners which came from hell, carried their influence, and spread their baneful mischiefs in our world! Yet who is will∣ing to own that he has been deceived and en∣slaved by them? Who is willing honestly to bring them forth to justice! All acknowledge that these enemies are among us, and many com∣plain aloud of the mischiefs that they do; yet even those who lift their heads so high as to laugh
<PB N="8" REF="012654_0007_0F8BBF6A6CFB4DF8"/>
at the atonement of Jesus, and the powerful influ∣ences of the Spirit, and slight public &amp; private de∣votion, are at the same time very unwilling to own that they harbour pride, infidelity, or any other of those dreadful tyrants. And nothing but the divine law refered to above, brought home with convincing light and power, can make them tru∣ly sensible of the soul-slavery that they are in: and 'tis only the power of the gospel that can set them <HI>free from sin,</HI> so as to become the ser∣vants of <HI>righteousness:</HI> can <HI>deliver</HI> them from these <HI>enemies,</HI> so as to <HI>serve God in holiness</HI> all their days. And those who do not thus <HI>know the truth,</HI> and have not been <HI>made free</HI> thereby,<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Rom. 6. 18. Luke 1. 74, 75. John 8. 32.</NOTE> yet have never been able in any country to subsist long without some sort of government; neither could any of them ever make out to es∣tablish any proper government without calling in the help of the Deity. However absurd their notions have been, yet they have found human sight and power to be so short and weak, and a∣ble to do so little toward watching over the con∣duct, and guarding the rights of individuals, that they have been forced to appeal to heaven by oaths, and to invoke assistance from thence to avenge the cause of the injured upon the guil∣ty. Hence it is so far from being necessary for any man to give up any part of his real liberty in order to submit to government, that all nati∣ons have found it necessary to submit to some government in order to enjoy any liberty and security at all.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="012654_0008_0F8BBF6B16568568"/>
We are not insensible that the general notion of liberty, is for each one to act or conduct as he pleases; but that government obliges us to act toward others by law and rule, which in the ima∣gination of many, interferes with such liberty; though when we come to the light of truth, what can possibly prevent it's being the highest pleasure, for every rational person, to love God with all his heart, and his neighbour as himself, but corruption and delusion? which, as was be∣fore noted, are foreigners and not originally be∣longing to men. Therefore the divine argu∣ment to prove, that those who promise liberty while they despise government are servants of corruption is this; <HI>For of whom a</HI> MAN <HI>is o∣vercome, of the same is he brought in bondage.</HI> 2 Pet. 2. 18, 19. He is so far from being <HI>free</HI> to act the <HI>man,</HI> that he is a <HI>bond slave</HI> to the worst of tyrants. And not a little of this tyran∣ny is carried on by such an abuse of language, as to call it liberty, for men to yield themselves up, to be so <HI>foolish, disobedient</HI> and <HI>deceived,</HI> as to <HI>serve divers lusts and pleasures.</HI> Tit. 3. 3.</P>
<P>Having offered these few thoughts upon the general nature of government and liberty, it is needful to observe, that God has appointed two kinds of government in the world, which are dis∣tinct in their nature, and ought never to be con∣founded together; one of which is called civil, the other ecclesiastical government. And tho' we shall not attempt a full explanation of them, yet some essential points of difference between them are necessary to be mentioned, in order truly to open our grievances.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION I.</HEAD>
<P>Some essential points of difference between ci∣vil and ecclesiastical government.</P>
<P N="1">1. The forming of the constitution, and ap∣pointment of the particular orders and offices of civil government is left to human discretion, and our submission thereto is required under the name of their being, the <HI>ordinances of men</HI> for the Lord's sake. 1 Pet. 2. 13, 14. Whereas in ecclesiastical affairs we are most solemnly warned not to be <HI>subject to ordinances, after the doc∣trines and commandments of men.</HI> Col. 2. 20, 22. And it is evident that He who is the only worthy object of worship, has always claimed it as his sole prerogative, to determine by express laws, what his worship shall be, who shall minister in it, and how they shall be supported. How ex∣press were his appointments concerning these things by Moses? And so wise and good a ruler as Solomon, was not intrusted with any legisla∣tive power upon either of these articles, but had the exact dimensions of the temple, the <HI>pattern</HI> and <HI>weight</HI> of every vessel, with the <HI>treasuries</HI> of the <HI>dedicate things,</HI> and the <HI>courses</HI> of the <HI>Priests and Levites,</HI> all given to him in <HI>writing by the Spirit,</HI> through the hand of his father David. 1 Chron. 28. 11—19. And so strict were God's faithful servants about these matters, that Da∣niel who in a high office in the Persian court, be∣haved so well that his most envious and crafty foes, could find no occasion against him, nor fault in him <HI>concerning the kingdom,</HI> till they fell upon the device of moving the king to make
<PB N="11" REF="012654_0010_0F8BBF6C97777A10"/>
a decree about worship, that should interfere with Daniel's obedience to his God; yet when that was done, he would not pay so much re∣gard to it as to shut his windows. Dan. 6. 4—11. And when the Son of God, who is the great Law-giver and King of his church, came and blotted out the hand-writing of the typical ordinances, and established a better covenant, or constitution of his church, upon better promises, we are assured that he was <HI>faithful in all his house, and counted worthy of more glory than Moses.</HI> What vacancy has he then left for fali∣able men to supply, by making new laws to re∣gulate and support his worship? especially if we consider,</P>
<P N="2">2. That as the putting any men into civil of∣fice is of men, of the people of the world; so of∣ficers have truly no more authority than the peo∣ple give them: And how came the people of the world by any ecclesiastical power? They arm the magistrate with the <HI>sword,</HI> that he may be a minister of God <HI>to them for good,</HI> and might execute wrath upon <HI>evil doers;</HI> and for this cause they pay them <HI>tribute:</HI> upon which the apostle proceeds to name those divine command∣ments which are comprehended in love to our neighbour, and which work <HI>no ill to him.</HI> Sure∣ly the inspired writer had not forgotten the first and great command of love to God; but as this chapter treats the most fully of the nature and end of civil government of any one in the new-testament, does it not clearly shew that the crimes which fall within the magistrates juris∣diction to punish, are only such as work ill to
<PB N="12" REF="012654_0011_0F8BBF6DCA0B2EA8"/>
our neighbour? Rom. 13. 1—10. While church government respects our behaviour to∣ward God as well as man.</P>
<P N="3">3. All acts of executive power in the civil state, are to be performed in the name of the king or state they belong to; while all our re∣ligious acts are to be done in the <HI>name of the Lord Jesus;</HI> and so are to be performed <HI>heartily as to the Lord, and not unto men.</HI> And it is but <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> service,</HI> and <HI>vain worship,</HI> if our <HI>fear toward him is taught by the precepts of men.</HI> Col. 3. 17, 23. Isa. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 13. Mat. 15. 9. It is often plead∣ed, that magistrates ought to do their duty in re∣ligious as well as civil affairs. That is readily granted; but what is their duty therein? Surely it is to <HI>bow to the name of Jesus,</HI> and to serve him with holy reverence; and if they do the contrary they may expect to <HI>perish from the way.</HI> Phil 2. 10. Psa. 2. 10—12. But where is the officer that will dare to come in the name of the Lord to demand, and forcibly to take, a tax which was imposed by the civil state! And can any man in the light of truth, maintain his character as a minister of Christ, if he is not con∣tented with all that Christ's name and influence will procure for him, but will have recourse to the <HI>kings of the earth,</HI> to force money from the peo∣ple to support them under the name of an em∣bassador of the <HI>God of heaven!</HI> Does not such conduct look more like the way of those who made <HI>merchandize of slaves and souls of men,</HI> than it does like the <HI>servants</HI> who were content to be <HI>as their Master,</HI> who said, <HI>He that heareth you
<PB N="13" REF="012654_0012_0F8BBF6E54019500"/>
heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me?</HI> Rev. 18. 9, 13. Luke 10. 3—16.</P>
<P N="4">4. In all civil governments some are ap∣pointed to judge for others, and have power to compel others to submit to their judgment: but our Lord has most plainly forbidden us, ei∣ther to assume or submit to any such thing in religion. Mat. 23. 1—9. Luke 22. 25—27. He declares, that the <HI>cause</HI> of his coming in∣to the world, was to bear <HI>witness unto the truth;</HI> and says he, <HI>Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.</HI> This is the nature of his <HI>Kingdom,</HI> which he say▪ <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not of this world:</HI> and gives that as the reason why his servants should not <HI>fight,</HI> or defend him with the <HI>sword.</HI> John. 18. 36, 37. And it appears to us that the true difference and exact limits between ecclesiastical and civil government is this, That the church is armed with <HI>light and truth,</HI> to pull down the strong holds of iniquity, and to gain souls to Christ, and into his church, to be governed by his rules therein; and again to exclude such from their communion, who will not be so governed; while the state is armed with the <HI>sword</HI> to guard the peace, and the civil rights of all persons and so∣cieties, and to punish those who violate the same. And where these two kinds of go∣vernment, and the weapons which belong to them, are well distinguished, and improved ac∣cording to the true nature and end of their in∣stitution, the effects are happy, and they do not at all interfere with each other: but where they have been confounded together, no tongue nor pen can fully describe the mischiefs that have ensued;
<PB N="14" REF="012654_0013_0F8BBF72AD6B8870"/>
of which the Holy Ghost gave early and plain warnings. He gave notice to the church, that the main of those antichristian confusions and abominations, would be drawn by philosophy and deceit, from the <HI>hand-writing of ordinances</HI> that Christ has <HI>blotted out.</HI> And to avoid the same, directs the saints to walk in Christ Jesus <HI>as they received him,</HI> rooted and built up <HI>in him,</HI> and stablished in the faith <HI>as they have been taught;</HI> viewing that they are <HI>complete in him, which is the</HI> HEAD <HI>over</HI> ALL PRINCIPALITY <HI>and</HI> POWER. Therefore he charges them not to be beguiled into a <HI>voluntary humility,</HI> by such <HI>flesh∣ly minds</HI> as do not hold this <HI>Head,</HI> but would subject them to ordinances after the doctrines and commandments of men. Col. 2.</P>
<P>Now 'tis well known that this glorious Head made no use of secular force in the first sitting up of the gospel church, when it might seem to be pecularly needful if ever; and it is also very evi∣dent, that ever since men came into the way of using force in such affairs, their main arguments to support it have been drawn from the old Jew∣ish constitution and ordinances. And what work has it made about the head as well as mem∣bers of the church?</P>
<P>First they moved Constantine, a secular prince, to draw his sword against heretics; but as all earthly states are changeable, the same sword that Constantine drew against heretics, Julion turned against the orthodox. However, as the high priest's sentence in the Jewish state, divided matters both for prince and people, the same de∣ceitful
<PB N="15" REF="012654_0014_0F8BBF7501754A80"/>
pilosophy that had gone so far, never left plotting till they had set up an ecclesiastical head over kingdoms as well as churches, who with Peter's keys was to open and shut, bind and loose, both in spiritual and temporal affairs. But after many generations had groaned under this hell∣ish tyranny, a time came when England renounc∣ed that head, and set up the king as their head in ecclesiastical as well as civil concernments; and though the free use of the scriptures which was then introduced, by a divine blessing, pro∣duced a great reformation, yet still the <HI>high places</HI> were not taken away, &amp; the <HI>lord bishops</HI> made such work in them, as drove our fathers from thence into America. The first colony that came to this part of it carried the reformation so far, as not to make use of the civil power to save the people to support religious ministers (for which they have had many a lash from the tongues &amp; pens of those who were fond of that way) but the second colony, who had not taken up the cross so as to separate from the national church before they came away, now determined to pick out all that they thought was of universal and moral equity in Moses's laws, and so to frame a christian common-wealth here.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Massachusetts history, vol. 3. p. 161.</NOTE> And as the Jews were ordered not to set up any rulers over them who were not their <HI>brethren;</HI> so this colony resolved to have no rulers nor voters for rulers, but brethren in their churches. And as the Jews were required to inflict corporal punish∣ments, even unto death, upon non-conformers to their worship, this common-wealth did the like to such as refused to conform to their way; and they
<PB N="16" REF="012654_0015_0F8BBF761EAB2688"/>
strove very hard to have the church govern the world, till they lost their charter; since which they have yielded to have the world govern the church, as we shall proceed to shew.</P>

<P>A brief view of how civil and ecclesiastical af∣fairs are blended together among us, to the de∣priving of many of God's people of that liberty of conscience which he has given them.</P>
<P>We are not insensible than an open appear∣ance against any part of the conduct of men in power, is commonly attended with difficulty and danger; and could we have found any way wherein with clearness we could have avoided the present attempt, we would gladly have taken it. But our blessed Lord &amp; only Redeemer, has com∣manded us, to <HI>stand fast in the liberty where∣with he has made us free;</HI> and things appear so to us at present that we cannot see how we can fully obey this command, without refusing any active compliance with some laws about re∣ligious affairs that are laid upon us. And as those who are interested against us, often accuse us of complaining unreasonably, we are brought under a necessity of laying open particular facts which otherwise we would gladly have conceal∣ed: and all must be sensible that there is a vast difference between exposing the faults, either of individuals or communities, when the cause of truth and equity would suffer without it, and the doing of it without any such occasion. We view it to be our incumbent duty, to render un∣to
<PB N="17" REF="012654_0016_0F8BBF764AC9DB28"/>
to Caesar the things that are his, but that it is of as much importance not to render unto him any thing that belongs only to God, who is to be o∣beyed rather than man. And as it is evident to us, that God always claimed it as his sole prero∣gative to determine by his own laws, what his worship shall be, who shall minister in it, and how they shall be supported; so it is evident that their prerogative has been, and still is, en∣croached upon in our land. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. Our legislature claim a power to compel every town and parish within their jurisdiction, to set up and maintain a pedobaptist worship a∣mong them; although it is well known, that in∣fant baptism is never express'd in the Bible, only is upheld by men's reasonings, that are chiefly drawn from Abraham's covenant which the Holy Ghost calls, <HI>The covenant of circumcision,</HI> Acts 7. 8. And as circumcision was one of the hand∣writing of ordinances which Christ has <HI>blotted out,</HI> where did any state ever get any right to compel their subjects to set up a worship upon that covenant?</P>
<P N="2">2. Our ascended Lord gives <HI>gifts unto men</HI> in a sovereign way as seems good unto him, and he requires <HI>Every man, as he has received the gift, even so to minister the same;</HI> and he re∣proved his apostles when they forbid one who was improving his gift, because he followed not them. 1 Pet. 4. 10, 11. Luk. 9. 49. But the Massachusetts legislature, while they claim a power to compel each parish to settle a minister, have also determined that he must be one, who
<PB N="18" REF="012654_0017_0F8BBF770DCB0D38"/>
has either an accademical degree, or a testimo∣nial in his favour from a majority of the mini∣sters in the county where the parish lies. So that let Christ give a man ever so great gifts, yet hereby these ministers derive a noble power from the state, to forbid the improvement of the same, if he follows not their schemes.<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">It has been the custom of minister's who are settled in this way, for these thirty years past, to apply the <HI>gainsaying of Core</HI> to those who have dissented from them; as if they were as certainly in the right way, as Moses and Aaron were. And 16 ministers in the county of Windham, in a public letter to their people in 1744, stile theirs, <Q>The instituted churches; and those who had withdrawn from them, uninstituted worship;</Q> and then they go on to assert, that Deut. 13, prove that the people, <Q>May not go af∣ter it, any more than—after a false god.</Q> p. 42. 43.</NOTE> And if the apostles assumed too much in this respect to themselves, even when their Lord was with them, can it be any breach of charity to conclude that ministers are not out of danger of doing the like now? especially if we consider how interest operates in the affair! For,</P>
<P N="3">3. Though the Lord hath <HI>ordained that they which preach the gospel shall live of the gospel;</HI> or by the free <HI>communications to them,</HI> which his gospel will produce. 1 Cor. 9. 13, 14. Gal. 6. 6. 7. Yet the ministers of our land have chosen to <HI>live by the law;</HI> and as a reason therefor, one of their most noted writers, instead of producing any truth of God, recites the tradition of a man, who said, <Q>Ministers of the gospel would have a poor time of it, if they must rely on a <HI>free contribution of the people</HI> for their mainten∣ance And he says, The laws of the pro∣vince
<PB N="19" REF="012654_0018_0F8BBF77E632CB18"/>
having had the royal approbation to ra∣tify them, they are the king's laws. By these laws it is enacted, that there shall be a public worship of God in every plantation; that the person elected by the majority of the inhabi∣tants to be so, shall be looked upon as the mi∣nister of the place; that the salary for him, which they shall agree upon, shall be levied by a rate upon all the inhabitants. In conse∣quence of this, the minister <HI>thus</HI> chosen by the people, is (not only Christ's but also) in reality, the <HI>king's minister;</HI> and the salary rais∣ed for him, is raised in the <HI>king's name,</HI> and is the king's allowance unto him.</Q><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dr. Cotton Mather's <HI>Ratio Disciplinae;</HI> or faithful account of the discipline professed and practised in the chur∣ches of New-England, 1726. p. 20.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now who can hear Christ declare, that his kingdom is, NOT OF THIS WORLD, and yet be∣lieve that this blending of church and state toge∣ther can be pleasing to him? For though their laws call them "orthodox ministers," yet the grand test of their orthodoxy, is the major vote of the people, be they saints or sinners, believ∣ers or unbelievers. This appears plain in the foregoing quotation; and another of their learned writers lately says, <Q>It is the congregation in it's parocal congregational capacity, that the <HI>law</HI> considers; and this as such does not enough partake of an ecclesiastical nature to be sub∣ject to ecclesiastical jurisdiction.</Q><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Dr. Stiles on the christian union. p. 85.</NOTE></P>

How can any man recon∣cile such proceedings to the following commands of our Master which is in heaven? Mat. 23. 9, 10.

Indeed as to doctrine ministers who preach differently, yea directly contrary to each other, about Christ and his salvation, yet are supported by these laws which at the same time limit the people to one circumstantial mode.</P>
<P>It is true the learned author just now quoted says, <Q>If the most of the inhabitants in a planta∣tion are episcopalians, they will have a minister of their own persuasion; and the <HI>dissenters,</HI> in the place, if there be any, must pay their pro∣portion of the tax for the support of this <HI>legal minister.</HI></Q><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><P>According to this rule, whoever gets the upper hand may tax the rest to their worship; but when will men learn the madness of such conduct!</P>

<P N="2">2. The <HI>effects</HI> of the constitution of our country are such, that as it makes the majority of the people the test of orthodoxy, so it embold∣ens them to usurp God's judgment seat, and (according to Dr. Mather's own account, which we have often seen verified) they daringly give out their sentence, That for a <HI>few</HI> to profess a persuasion different from the <HI>majority,</HI> it must be from bad motives; and that, <HI>they know in their conscience</HI> that they do not act by the uni∣versal law of equity, if they plead to be exempt∣ed from paying the <HI>money</HI> which the <HI>majority</HI> demand of them! And though in our CHAR∣TER

And perhaps the learned author now referred to, never delivered a plainer truth, than when he said, <Q>The re∣forming churches flying from Rome, carried some of them more, some of them less, all of them something of Rome with them, especi∣ally in that spirit of <HI>imposition</HI> and <HI>persecution</HI> which too much cleaved to them.</Q></P>

<P>How weighty are these arguments against confounding church and state together? yet this author's appearing against such confusion, was the chief cause for which he was banished out of the Massachusetts colony. And though few if any will now venture openly to justify those pro∣ceedings, and many will exclaim against them at a high rate; yet a fair examination may plainly shew, that those fathers had more appearance of a warrant for doing as they did, than their chil∣dren now have, for the actings which we com∣plain of. For those fathers were persuaded, that the judicial laws of Moses which required Israel to punish blasphemers, and apostates to i∣dolatry with death, were of moral force, and binding upon all princes and states;<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Bloody tenet washed, p. 55.</NOTE> especial∣ly

on such as these plantations were.<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Massachusetts history, vol. 3. p. 161.</NOTE> And how much more countenance did this give for the use of force to make men <HI>conform</HI> to what they believed to be the right way, than men can now have for compelling any to <HI>support</HI> a way which at the same time they are allowed to dissent from? For the Jews also were required to pull down houses, and to have persons away out of their camps or cities, if the priests pronounced them unclean; and they were not permitted to set up any king over them who was not a <HI>bro∣ther</HI> in their church. Did not these things afford arguments much more plausible, for their at∣tempt to compel the world to submit to the church, than any can have for the modern way, of trying to subject the church in her religious affairs to rulers, and the major vote of inhabi∣tants, a great part of whom are not brethren in any church at all! Though the state of Israel was obliged thus to inflict death or banishment upon non-conformers to their worship, yet we have not been able to find, that they were ever allowed to use any <HI>force</HI> to collect the priests or prophets maintenance. So far from it, that those who made any such attempts were <HI>sons of Beliel,</HI> and persons that <HI>abhorred judgment, and pervert∣ed</HI> ALL EQUITY. 1 Sam. 2. 12—16. Mic. 3. 5, 9.</P>

we appeal to every conscience, whether it does not condemn the way of setting up one <HI>party</HI> to the injury of another. Our Lord tells us plainly, that <HI>few</HI> find the narrow way, while <HI>many</HI> go in the <HI>broad way;</HI> yet the scheme we complain of, has given the <HI>many</HI> such power o∣ver the <HI>few,</HI> that if the few are fully convinced that the teacher set up by the many, is one that <HI>causeth</HI> people to <HI>err,</HI> and is so far from bring∣ing the pure <HI>gospel doctrine,</HI> that they should break the divine command, and become <HI>parta∣kers of his evil deeds;</HI> if they did not <HI>cease to hear him,</HI> or to receive him <HI>into their houses</HI> as a gospel minister;<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Prov. 19 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> John 10▪ 11▪</NOTE> yet only for refusing to put into such a minister's mouth, the many are <HI>pre∣pared</HI> with such instruments of <HI>war against them,</HI> as to seize their goods, or cast their bodies into prison, where they may starve and die, for all what that constitution has provided for them. In cases of common debts the law has provided several ways of relief, as it has not in the case be∣fore us; for here the assessors plead, that they are <HI>obliged</HI> to tax all according to law, and the collector has the same plea for gathering of it, and the minister says, I agreed with the society for such a sum, and it is not my business to re∣lease any. So that we have had instances of se∣rious christians, who must have died in prison for ministers rates, if christianity and humanity had not moved people to provide them that re∣lief, which neither those ministers nor the law that upholds them have done.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="012654_0028_0F8BBF84F8B48290"/>
Another argument which these ministers of∣ten mention, is the apostolic direction to us, to pray for all that are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all <HI>godliness</HI> and <HI>honesty.</HI> But do they pray and act according to that direction? One while they cry up the great advantages of having religion established by law; and some have caused near as loud a clamour about it as the <HI>craftsmen</HI> did at Ephesus; but when it comes to be calmly represented, that, Religion is a <HI>voluntary obedience unto God,</HI> which therefore <HI>force</HI> cannot promote; how soon do they shift the scene, and tell us, that <HI>religious liberty</HI> is fully al∣lowed to us, only the state have in their wisdom thought fit to tax all the inhabitants, to support an order of men for the good of <HI>civil society.</HI> A little while ago it was for religion, and many have declared, that without it we should soon have no religion left among us: but now tis to maintain civility. Though by the way, it is well known, that no men in the land, have done more to promote uncivil treatment of dissenters from themselves, than some of these pretended ministers of civility have done. In 1644 the court at Boston passed an act to punish men with banishment, if they opposed infant bap∣tism, or departed from any of their congregati∣ons when it was going to be administered.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Clark's narrative, p. 35.</NOTE> And after they had acted upon this law, one of their chief magistrates observed, that such methods tended to make hypocrites. To which a noted minister replied, That if it did so, yet such were better than profane persons, because said he, <Q>Hypocrites give God part of his due, the out∣ward
<PB N="30" REF="012654_0029_0F8BBF8544138888"/>
man, but the profane person giveth God neither outward nor inward man.</Q><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Massachusetts history, vol. 3. p. 405.</NOTE> By which it seems that in that day, they were zealous to have the outward man if no more <HI>given to God;</HI> but now that conduct is condemned as persecution, by their children, who profess to allow us full liberty of conscience, because they do not hinder our giving our inward man to God, only claim a power to seize our outward man to get money for themselves. And though many of us have expended ten or twenty times as much, in sett∣ing up and supporting that worship which we be∣lieve to be right, as it would have cost us to have continued in the fashionable way, yet we are of∣ten accused of being coveteous, for dissenting from that way, and refusing to pay more money out of our little incomes, to uphold men from whom we receive no benefit, but rather abuse.

<P>A brief account of what the baptists have suffered under this constitution, and of their reasons for refusing any active compliance with it.</P>
<P>Many are ready to say, the baptists are ex∣empted from ministerial taxes, therefore why do they complain? Answer, We would be far from forgetting or undervaluing of our privileges: but are willing thankfully to ac∣knowledge, that our honored rulers do protect
<PB N="31" REF="012654_0030_0F8BBF8608363028"/>
our societies, so as not to allow them to be interrupted in their worship; and as the taking cognizance of marriage belongs to them, we take it as a favour that they grant our ministers power to administer it, so that we may have marriage solemnized among ourselves. Many other liberties we also enjoy under the govern∣ment that is set over us, for which we desire to be thankful, both to the Author, and to the in∣struments of them. Yet if our opponents could once put themselves into our place, we doubt not but they would think it was high time, to seek for more full liberty than we have hitherto en∣joyed, a short view of but a little part of what we have met with, my be sufficient to evince this.</P>
<P>Our charter, as before observed, gives us e∣qual religious liberty with other christians: yet the pedobaptists being the greatest party, they soon made a perpetual law lo support their own way, but did nothing of that nature to exempt our denomination from it, for 36 years; and since that time, what they have done in that respect has only been by temporary acts, which have been so often changed, that many times their own officers have hardly known what the law was, that was in force; and as an exact confor∣mity to the letter of their laws is much insisted upon in their executive courts, while those acts have never been enforced with penalties upon their own people, they have often broken them, and we have had but little chance to get them punished for so doing. For in all their acts till the last, they have imposed a name upon us, that signifies <HI>re-baptizers,</HI> which we cannot under∣standingly
<PB N="32" REF="012654_0031_0F8BBF86C791ED60"/>
own. In many acts the words, "be∣longing thereto," were inserted so ambigously, as to leave it disputable, whether a being church members, or only a belonging to the congregati∣on or worshipping assembly were intended; and in the case of Haverhill, where their certificate was otherways compleat, and the case had been determined in the baptists favor, in that which both parties had agreed should be the final trial; yet another hearing was obtained, in which the want of them ambiguous words in the certificate, was made the main plea by which an action was turned against us, of near three hundred dollars. All their latter acts have required a list or lists of our societies, to be given in annually by a certain day, signed by three principal members, and the minister if there be any; and because one of our churches of above 50 members (and which is now a church in good credit) happened one year to have such a difficulty with their mi∣nister, as prevented the giving in of said list, they were taxed to pedobaptist ministers; and tho' some of the society were advised to apply to their county court for relief, yet instead of obtaining any, the court took away 20 dollars more from them. Another church gave in their list by the direction of a noted lawyer, yet they were all taxed to the pedobaptist worship, and one of the principal members of the baptist church, which the law directed to sign the list, was strained up∣on; and both the inferior and superior court turned the case against him, because he was a <HI>party concerned.</HI></P>
<P>Here note, the inhabitants of our mother-country are not more of a party concerned, in
<PB N="33" REF="012654_0032_0F8BBF878D7EAE70"/>
imposing taxes upon us without our consent, than they have been in this land who have made and executed laws, to tax <HI>us</HI> to uphold <HI>their worship.</HI> This <HI>party influence</HI> has appeared in a much larger number of instances than we are willing to trouble the public with at this time; but one instance more will set our case in such a striking light, that we must ask for a very serious attention to it; we mean that of Ashfield, for∣merly called Hunts-town in the county of Hamp∣shire. One of the conditions on which that plantation was granted by our legislature, was their settling a learned orthodox minister, and building a meeting-house. Now in the year 1761, full two thirds of the inhabitants called and settled a minister, who they believed was taught of God and truly orthodox. But not being of the same mode with the court (for they were bap∣tists) other people were prompted on, before this society could get up a meeting-house, to settle another minister, and to tax the first minister with all his people to support their way. This burden the baptists bore for a number of years, till in 1768, they presented a petition to our general court for relief; who ordered that they should serve the town and proprietors of Ashfield with a copy of the petition, that they might shew cause, if any they had, at the next session of the court why it should not be granted, and that a further collection of taxes from the petitioners should be suspended in the mean time. Yet in the same session of the court, a law was made which cut the baptists in that place, off from any exemption from ministerial taxes at all. In consequence of which several hundred acres
<PB N="34" REF="012654_0033_0F8BBF884D790920"/>
of their lands were sold at public auction, for but a small part of their real value; of which ten acres belonged to the baptist minister. And af∣ter five or six journies of above an hundred miles to seek relief, and long waiting without suc∣cess, their messenger was at last plainly told, by a number of our representatives, <Q>That they had a right to make that law, and to keep the baptists under it as long as they saw fit.</Q> Hereupon notice was given in some Boston pa∣pers, of a design among our churches of joining to seek redress from another quarter.</P>
<P>Accordingly at an association or general meet∣ing of our churches at Bellingham, in Septem∣ber, 1770, these things were considered, and it was unanimously agreed upon to apply to his Ma∣jesty for help, if it could not speedily be obtained here, and a committee and agents were chosen for that purpose. When news hereof was spread, our committee were urged by leading men both in church and state, to apply again to our gene∣ral court; which therefore they did in October following. In the mean time a piece dated from Cambridge, where the court was then sitting, was published in all the Boston news-papers, wherein it was represented that, <Q>All possible care had been taken to prevent our suffering the <HI>least disadvantage</HI> from our religious sen∣timents;</Q> and we were challenged to shew the contrary if we could.</P>
<P>Upon this the pious and learned Mr. John Davis, who from Pennsylvania had not long before been ordained pastor of the second bap∣tist
<PB N="35" REF="012654_0034_0F8BBF8904428BB0"/>
church in Boston, and who was clerk of our committee, called them together to consider of this matter. And though they were far from desiring to enter into a news-paper controversy, yet they advised him to make some reply to that challenge: He did so; and on Dec. 27, pub∣lished a brief and plain view of the case of Ash∣field: but instead of any fair and manly treat∣ment upon it, he in the Evening-Post o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Jan. 7, 1771, was not only insulted with the names of, <Q>A little upstart gentleman; enthusiastical big∣got; and, this stripling high-fliar;</Q> but had it also insinuated that he was employed <Q>by the <HI>enemies</HI> of America to <HI>defame</HI> and <HI>blacken</HI> the colonies, and this town in particular.</Q> And they had the impudence to pretend to the world, that all this was wrote by a CATHOLIC BAPTIST. And they inflamed the populace so against Mr. Davis, that his most judicious friends were a∣fraid of his being mobbed. But can it be in the power of others to <HI>blacken</HI> any people so much, as by this treatment of a worthy stranger (now at rest) they have blackened themselves! Instead of honestly <HI>coming to the light</HI> (which our Lord gives as the criterion to know him <HI>that doth truth,</HI> John 3. 21.) how do they hover in the works of darkness.</P>
<P>The first article in our committee's petition to the legislature, being for Ashfield, they were or∣dered to notify the proprietors thereof: They did so; and in the spring session of the assembly, they came with a long address against us, in which they begin, with saying more generally of the baptists in that part of the province, <Q>The
<PB N="36" REF="012654_0035_0F8BBF8A2F834CB0"/>
proprietors conceive it to be a duty they owe to God and their country, not to be dispensed with, to lay open the characters, and real <HI>springs of action</HI> of some of these people.</Q> Then they go on to say, <Q>The <HI>rule</HI> the petiti∣oners have set up, and on which alone they seem to ground their claim of exemption, is <HI>falsly applied,</HI> and therefore all arguments bot∣tomed on it must be inconclusive. <HI>Natural rights,</HI><NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Here note, the plea of our petition was for what we are <Q>Intitled to as men, as christians, and subjects of a free government.—Some of the laws of this province, we think deprive us of a CHARTER privilege.</Q> These are what we grounded all our claims upon; yet they insinuate that our claim was in this affair to be, <Q>restored to a state of nature;</Q> like those who are under no civil govern∣ment at all. Notwithstanding we expresly speak of our being subjects of a free government, and pleaded charter-privileges. Remember what is said of those who <HI>Turn aside to their crooked ways!</HI></NOTE> as the respondents humbly conceive, are in this province <HI>wholly</HI> superceded in this case by <HI>civil obligation,</HI> and in matters of taxa∣tion individuals cannot with the least propriety plead them.</Q> Having thus denied us any claim from <HI>natural rights,</HI> they resume what they call an indispensible duty, viz. an attempt to lay before our honored legislature the baptists' cha∣racter, and the <HI>springs</HI> of their actions; and after a number of mean reflections without any proof at all, they sum up the springs of the actions of most of them to be <Q>Pride, vanity, prejudice, impurity and uncharitableness.</Q> Very dread∣ful indeed if it could be proved! but that is re∣ferred to a hereafter, and they say, <Q>At present we shall content ourselves with assuring your excellency and honors, that the foregoing ac∣count is not exaggerated.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="012654_0036_0F8BBF8AB913EC58"/>
From this they proceed to observe, that as it belongs to rulers to <Q>protect and support all regular religious societies of protestants,</Q> so they say, <Q>Whenever any religion or profession wears an <HI>ill aspect to the state,</HI> it is become a proper object of attention to the legislature.—And this is the religion of the people whom we have been describing.</Q> How much does this resemble the language of him who said, <HI>It is not for the king's profit to suffer them!</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ester 3. 8.</NOTE> or theirs who cried, <HI>If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend!</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">John 19. 12.</NOTE></P>
<P>After thus representing that the religion of the baptists that way, wears an <HI>ill aspect to the state,</HI> they go on to speak of the conditions upon which Ashfield was granted; and then try to prove that Mr. Ebenezer Smith, pastor of the baptist church there, <Q>is not a minister in law,</Q> because he has neither an accademical degree, nor a testimonial in his favor from the majority of the ministers of that county. And to give an idea of the smallness of his ability for teaching, they say, <Q>Taking occasion in one of his discourses upon that passage of scrip∣ture, in which mention is made of the thick bosses of God's buckler; instead of <HI>buckler,</HI> he gave his hearers the word <HI>butler.</HI> Being in∣terrogated by one occasionally present as to his meaning, he explained himself so as clearly shewed, he meant to connect the other part of the sentence with the word butler, in the commonly received sense of the word.</Q></P>
<P>The clearest light we have gained in the mat∣ter is this. After Mr. Smith had been preach∣ing
<PB N="38" REF="012654_0037_0F8BBF8F2DFF3520"/>
in a neighbouring town some years ago, a minister who was present asked him what a but∣ler was? he readily replied, <HI>Pharoah'</HI>s <HI>cup-bearer.</HI> After a little more talk, said minister<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The minister who thus treated Mr. Smith is nearly re∣lated to a ruler who has had a principal hand in all their troubles at Ashfield, and likely they were confederates in forming this address against them. And it is generally be∣lieved that it was the same minister who published a piece a∣gainst the baptists of Ashfield, in the Boston News-Letter of Feb. 7, 1771; to which Mr. Smith returned an Answer in the same paper of March 21, following; wherein, from public records and other ways, he detected said writer in a number of gross violations of truth.</NOTE> asserted, That Mr. Smith used the word butler instead of buckler in his sermon. He did not remember that he had; but if he did so, how injurious is the above representation? is it not the evil which we read of in Isa. 29. 20, 21? Having made this reflection upon Mr. Smith, they say, <Q>He has none of the qualifications of a minister ac∣cording to the laws of Christ, or of this pro∣vince, unless those of <HI>simplicity</HI> and <HI>orthodoxy.</HI></Q> We wish his accusers were so well qualified. 2 Cor. 1. 12. and 4. 2.</P>
<P>In April, 1771, the address we have made a few remarks upon was referred to a committe of both houses of our general court, who reported that, <Q>Your committe find, that in the sale of those lands there was no unfairness, but every thing was quite fair, quite neighbourly, and <HI>quite legal.</HI></Q><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Twenty acres of said land with a good orchard upon it, a man bid off in April, 1770, for 35 shillings, which he sued for the next August, and laid his damages at eight pounds; but upon trial the court found that the sale was <HI>Not legal,</HI> and therefore turned the case against him. With what face then, said Mr. Davis, could the writer of that re∣port say as he does!</NOTE> And as to our plea for exemp∣tion
<PB N="39" REF="012654_0038_0F8BBF9181571038"/>
from ministerial taxes they say, <Q>There is an essential difference between persons being taxed where they are not represented, there∣fore against their wills, and being taxed when represented.</Q> So they advised the court to dismiss our petition as unreasonable; and though the honorable house of representatives did not accept that advice, but voted to repeal the Ash∣field law; yet the council refused to concur with them therein; so that if his gracious Majesty in council had not disannuled said law for us, our brethren of Ashfield must, for ought that ap∣peared to the contrary, have been entirely strip∣ped of the inheritances, which they had purcha∣sed, and subdued at the peril of their lives, be∣cause of the sword of the wilderness.</P>
<P>It may be remembered that the pedobaptist proprietors of Ashfield, represented that the bap∣tists there were not worthy of the <HI>protecti∣on</HI> of our legislature. The following narra∣tive may help to explain what they meant by it. The news of what our king had done for them, arrived and was published in Boston the latter end of October, 1771, at which their oppressors discovered great uneasiness; and on the 8th of November came two officers with nu∣merous attendants, to the house of Mr. Smith, father of the baptist minister in Ashfield, (and very much of a father to that society) with a warrant from the chief judge of that county, to
<PB N="40" REF="012654_0039_0F8BBF92943F5598"/>
seize his person, and to search his house and shop for bad money: and it was said they had a like warrant for the minister, but he happened to be then absent on a journey. His father was made a prisoner before he was out of his bed in the morning, and though he promised the use of his keys, and desired that no lock might be broken, yet while he was at prayer with his family, for which he obtained leave of one officer, the other broke open his shop, and did considerable da∣mage there; and after searching both that and his house as much as they pleased, they carried him before the aforesaid judge and others; where it plainly appeared that the complaint was en∣tered against Mr. Smith from a report, that he had put off a counterfeit dollar; which report was then proved to be a false one. Yet the old gentleman was not released, but was kept a pri∣soner through a cold night, in circumstances that greatly injured his health, and next day was bro't on further examination, when even his frequent retirement for secret devotion, which he had practised for above forty years, was catched hold of to raise a suspicion of his being guilty: and he was bound over with two sureties to the next superior court in that county. Hereupon the following men who had been called as witnesses against him, gave him their testimony in writ∣ing, declaring that they were ready to make oath to it, in the following terms, viz.</P>

<P>Also <HI>Leonard Pike,</HI> to whom the report was that Mr. Smith had put off a bad dollar, gave from under his hand that said report had no truth in it. These are eight of the ten witnesses that were summoned against Mr. Smith; &amp; tho' much pains was taken to procure evidence against him at the superior court, yet he was entirely acquit∣ted; and the law was open for him to come back for damages, for a <HI>malicious prosecution;</HI> but they had contrived to have the complaint against him entered by a bankrupt, so that no recompence might be obtained by him. Are these the good∣ly fruits of having a particular mode of worship established by law, and their ministers supported by force!</P>
<P>Though we are often accused of complaining without reason, yet no longer ago than the 26th
<PB N="42" REF="012654_0041_0F8BBF9389FADAF8"/>
of last January, three men of good credit, be∣longing to a numerous and regular baptist socie∣ty in Chelmsford, were seized for ministerial rates (notwithstanding they had given in a list according to law) and though one of them was above four score years old, another very infirm in body, while the third had no man at home, able to take care of the out-door affairs of his numerous family, yet they, in that cold season, were all carried prisoners to Concord goal.</P>
<P>These accounts we have received from good au∣thority, and have taken great pains to have them stated as exactly and truly as possible; and if any can point out the least mistake in what has been now related, we shall be glad to correct it. At the same time we are far from charging all the evils we complain of, upon the whole congregational denomination without distinction; for we believe there were many among them in various stations, who are sorely grieved at these oppressions. We are willing also to make all the allowance that is reasonable, for the influence of old customs, education and other prejudices, in those who have injured their neighbours in these affairs; but is it not high time now to awake, and seek for a more thorough reformation! We agree with the committee of our honored legislature in saying, There is an essential difference between persons being taxed <HI>where they are represented,</HI> and being taxed where they are not so; therefore the whole matter very much turns upon this point, viz. Whether our <HI>civil</HI> legislature are in truth our representatives in <HI>religious</HI> affairs, or not? As God has always claimed it as his prerogative,
<PB N="43" REF="012654_0042_0F8BBF944AB29A08"/>
to appoint who shall be his ministers, and how they shall be supported, so under the gospel, the peoples communications to Christ's ministers and members, are called <HI>sacrifices</HI> with which <HI>God is well-pleased.</HI> Phil. 4. 18. Heb. 13, 16—18. And what government on earth ever had, or e∣ver can have any power to make or execute any laws to appoint and enforce <HI>sacrifices to God!</HI></P>
<P>In civil states the power of the whole collec∣tive body is vested in a few hands, that they may with better advantage defend themselves against injuries from abroad, and correct abuses at home, for which end a few have a right to judge for the whole society; but in religion each one has an equal right to judge for himself; for we must all <HI>appear</HI> before the judgment seat of Christ, that <HI>every one</HI> may receive the things <HI>done in his body,</HI> according to that <HI>he hath done</HI> (not what any earthly representative hath done for him) 2 Cor. 5. 10 And we freely confess that we can find no more warrant from divine truth, for any people on earth to constitute any men their representatives, to make laws, to impose religious taxes, than they have to appoint Peter or the Vir∣gin Mary to represent them before the throne a∣bove. We are therefore brought to a stop about paying so much regard to such laws, as to give in annual certificates to the other denomination, as we have formerly done.</P>
<P N="1">1. Because the very nature of such a prac∣tice implies an acknowledgment, that the civil power has a right to set one religious sect up a∣bove another, else why need we give certificates
<PB N="44" REF="012654_0043_0F8BBF9508A783E0"/>
to them any more than they to us? It is a tacit allowance that they have a right to make laws about such things, which we believe in our con∣sciences they have not. For,</P>
<P N="2">2. By the foregoing address to our legisla∣ture, and their committees report thereon, it is evident, that they claim a right to tax us from <HI>civil obligation,</HI> as being the representatives of the people. But how came a civil community by any ecclesiastical power? how came the king∣doms of <HI>this world</HI> to have a right to govern in Christ's kingdom which is <HI>not of this world!</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. That constitution not only emboldens people to <HI>judge the liberty of other mens consci∣ences,</HI> and has carried them so far as to tell our general assembly, that they conceived it to be a <HI>duty they owed to God</HI> and their country, not to be dispensed with, to lay before them the <HI>springs</HI> of their neighbours actions;<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">How are men deluded to think they <HI>do God service,</HI> when they violate his word! 1 Cor. 4. 5. Would not the same principle carry them to <HI>kill</HI> Christ's disciples un∣der the same pretence? John 16▪ 2.</NOTE> but it also requires something of the same nature from us. Their laws require us annually to certify to them, what our belief is concerning the <HI>conscience</HI> of every person that assembles with us, as the condition of their being exempted from taxes to other's worship. And only because our brethren in Bel∣lingham, left that clause about the <HI>conscience</HI> out of their certificates last year, a number of their society who live at Mendon were lately taxed, and suffered the spoiling of their goods to uphold pe∣dobaptist worship.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="45" REF="012654_0044_0F8BBF95CCE7A660"/>
4. The scheme we oppose evidently tends to destroy the purity and life of religion; for the inspired apostle assures us, that the church is <HI>es∣poused as a chaste virgin to Christ,</HI> and is obliged to be <HI>subject to him in every thing,</HI> as a true wife is to her husband. Now the most chaste domes∣tic obedience, does not at all interfere with any lawful subjection to civil authority; but for a woman to admit the highest ruler in a nation into her husband's place, would be <HI>adultery</HI> or <HI>whoredom;</HI> and how often are <HI>mens inven∣tions</HI> about worship so called in the sacred ora∣cles?<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Psalm 106. 39. We delight not in hard names, but every vice ought to be called by it's proper name; and the custom in this adulterous age of calling those, <HI>natural chil∣dren,</HI> which God calls <HI>children of whoredom,</HI> has doubtless had a pernicious effect upon many to embolden them to go on in their filthy ways. God charged his ancient church with <HI>playing the harlot,</HI> because she said, <HI>I will go after my lo∣vers, that gave me my bread and my water;</HI>—<HI>For she did not know that</HI> I GAVE HER CORN, &amp;c. Hosea 2. 5, 8. By which it appears, that to fix our dependence upon any o∣ther beside the divine Being, and to pursue any method be∣side his directions, to obtain the necessaries and comforts of life, is whoredom; and does not the chief sin of the <HI>mother of harlots</HI> lie in her fixing this dependence upon the <HI>kings of the earth?</HI> Rev. 18. 3—13.</NOTE> And does it not greatly concern us all, earnestly to search out and put away such evils, as we would desire to escape the awful judgments that such wickedness has brought on other na∣tions! Especially if we consider that not only the purity, but also the very life and being of religion among us is concerned therein; for 'tis evident that Christ has given as plain laws to de∣termine what the duty of people is to his minis∣ters, as he has the duty of ministers to his peo∣ple;
<PB N="46" REF="012654_0045_0F8BBF96B6F36200"/>
and most certainly he is as able to enforce the one as the other. The common plea of our opponents is, that people will not do their duty if rulers do not enforce it; but does not the whole book of God clearly shew, that ministers as often fail of doing their duty as the people do? And where is the care of rulers to punish ministers for their unfaithfulness? They often talk about <HI>equality</HI> in these affairs, but where does it appear! As Christ is THE HEAD of all <HI>principality</HI> and <HI>power;</HI> so the <HI>not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having</HI> NOURISHMENT MINISTRED, <HI>and</HI> KNIT TOGETHER, <HI>increaseth with the increase</HI> OF GOD, but bringing in an <HI>earthly power</HI> between Christ and his peo∣ple, has been the grand source of anti-christian abominations, and of settling men down in <HI>a form of godliness,</HI> while they <HI>deny the power there∣of.</HI> Has not this earthly scheme prevailed so far in our land, as to cause many ministers, in∣stead of <HI>taking heed to the ministry received from the Lord;</HI> and instead of <HI>watching for souls as those who must give an account,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Col. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 17 Heb. 13. 17.</NOTE> rather to act as if they were not accountable to any higher pow∣er, than that of the <HI>men</HI> who support them?—and on the other hand, how do many people be∣have as if they were more afraid of the collec∣tor's warrant, and of an earthly prison, than of Him who sends his ministers to preach his gos∣pel, and says, <HI>He that receiveth whomsoever I send, receiveth me;</HI> but declares, That it shall be more tolerable in the day of judgment <HI>for Sodom,</HI> than for those who <HI>receive them not?</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Joh. 13. 20.

than of our great King and Judge, who can <HI>this night</HI> require the soul of him that layeth up <HI>treasure for himself, and is not rich towards God;</HI> and will sentence all either to heaven or hell, ac∣cording as they have treated Him well or ill, in his ministers and members.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Luk. 12. 20, 21. Mat. 25. 31, &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P N="5">5. The custom which they want us to coun∣tenance, is very hurtful to civil society: for by the law of Christ <HI>every man,</HI> is not only allowed, but also required, to judge for himself, concern∣ing the circumstantials as well as the essentials, of religion, and to act according to the <HI>full per∣suasion of his own mind;</HI> and he contracts guilt to his soul if he does the contrary. Rom. 14. 5, 23. What a temptation then does it lay for men to contract such guilt, when temporal advantages are annexed to one persuasion, and disadvantages laid upon another? i. e. in plain terms, how does it tend to hypocrisy and lying? than which, what can be worse to human society! Not only so, but coercive measures about religion also tend to provoke to emulation, wrath and contention, and who can describe all the mischiefs of this nature, that such measures have produced in our land! But where each person, and each society, are equally protected from being injured by o∣thers, all enjoying equal liberty, to attend and support the worship which they believe is right, having no more striving for mastery or superiori∣ty than <HI>little children</HI> (which we must all come to, or not <HI>enter into the kingdom of heaven</HI>) how happy are it's effects in civil society? In the town of Boston they enjoy something of these blessings,
<PB N="48" REF="012654_0047_0F8BBF9C58033F50"/>
and why may not the country have the same li∣berty? The ministers who have had the chief hand in stirring up rulers to treat us as they have done, yet have sometimes been forced to com∣mend the liberty we plead for. When they want∣ed to get footing in the town of Providence, they wrote to governor Jencks and other rulers there, in the following words, viz.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>And now our dear countrymen, we beseech you seriously to consider of these things. The great importance of a general union through this country, in order to the preservation of our li∣berties, has often been pleaded for with proprie∣ty; but how can such a union be expected so long as that dearest of all rights, equal liberty of conscience is not allowed? Yea, how can any reasonably expect that HE who has the hearts of kings in his hand, will turn the heart of our earthly sovereign to hear the pleas for liberty, of those who will not hear the cries of their fellow-subjects, under their oppressions? Has it not
<PB N="53" REF="012654_0052_0F8BBFA11C2EFF10"/>
been plainly proved, that so far as any man gra∣tifies his own inclinations, without regard to the universal law of equity, so far he is in bondage? so that it is impossible for any one to tyranize over others, without thereby becoming a misera∣ble slave himself: a slave to raging lusts, and a slave to guilty fears of what will be the conse∣quence. We are told that the father of Cyrus, tho' a heathen, <Q>Had often taught him to con∣sider, that the prudence of men is very short, and their views very limited; that they can∣not penetrate into futurity; and that many times what they think must needs turn to their advantage proves their ruin; whereas the Gods being eternal, know all things, future as well as past, and inspire those that love them to undertake what is most expedient for them; which is a favor and protection they owe to no man, and grant only to those that invoke and consult them.</Q> And we are told by the same author,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rollin in his ancient history</NOTE> of another wise heathen, who said, <Q>'Tis observable, that those that fear the Deity most, are least afraid of man.</Q> And shall not christians awake to a most hearty reverence of HIM who has said, (and will ever make good his word) <HI>With what measure ye meet, it shall be measured to you again.</HI></P>
<P>Suffer us a little to expostulate with our fathers and brethren, who inhabit the land to which our ancestors fled for religious liberty. You have lately been accused with being disorderly and rebellious, by men in power, who profess a
<PB N="54" REF="012654_0053_0F8BBFA1C84A21A0"/>
great regard for order and the public good; and why don't you believe them, and rest easy under their administrations? You tell us you can∣not, because you are taxed where you are not represented; and is it not really so with us? You do not deny the right of the British parlia∣ment to impose taxes within her own realm; on∣ly complain that she extends her taxing power beyond her proper limits; and have we not as good right to say you do the <HI>same thing?</HI> and so that wherein you judge others you condemn your selves? Can three thousand miles possibly fix such limits to taxing power, as the difference be∣tween civil and sacred matters has already done? One is only a distance of <HI>space,</HI> the other is so great a difference in the <HI>nature</HI> of things, as there is be∣tween <HI>sacrifices to God,</HI> and the <HI>ordinances of men.</HI> This we trust has been fully proved.</P>
<P>If we ask why have you not been easy and thankful since the parliament has taken off so many of the taxes that they had laid upon us? you answer that they still claim a power to tax us, when, and as much as they please; and is not that the very difficulty before us? In the year 1747, our legislature passed an act to free the baptists in general from ministerial taxes for ten years: yet because they increased consider∣ably, when that time was about half expired, they broke in upon the liberty they had granted, and made a new act, wherein no baptist church nor minister was allowed to have any such exemption. till they had <HI>first</HI> obtained certificates from three other churches. By which the late Mr. John Procter observed (in a remonstrance that he
<PB N="55" REF="012654_0054_0F8BBFA291DB51D0"/>
drew, and which was presented to our court) that they had as far as in them lay, <Q>disfran∣chised, unchurched and usurped an illegal power over all the religious societies of the people in said act called anabaptists through∣out this province:—For where is it possible for the poor anabaptists to find the <HI>first</HI> three authenticated ministers and churches to au∣thenticate the first three!</Q> So we have now related a case, in which a number of our breth∣ren were put to new cost for copies to notify o∣thers, with hope of relief to themselves, and yet in the same session of court, they had a worse burden laid upon them than before; and their repeated cries, and then the petition of our uni∣ted churches, were all rejected.</P>
<P>A very great greivance which our country has justly complained of is, that by some late proceedings a man's house or locks cannot secure either his person or his property, from oppressive officers. Pray then consider what our brethren have suffered at Ashfield.</P>
<P>Many think it hard to be frowned upon only for pleading for their rights, and laying open parti∣cular acts of encroachment thereon; but what frowns have we met with for no other crime? and as the present contest between Great-Britain and America, is not so much about the greatness of the taxes already laid, as about a submission to their taxing power; so (though what we have al∣ready suffered is far from being a trifle, yet) our greatest difficulty at present concerns the submit∣ting
<PB N="56" REF="012654_0055_0F8BBFA34DA8A888"/>
to a taxing power in ecclesiastical affairs. It is supposed by many that we are exempted from such taxes, but they are greatly mistaken, for all know that paper is a money article, and writing upon it is labour, and this tax we must pay eve∣ry year, as a token of submission to their power, or else they will lay a heavier tax upon us. And we have one difficulty in submitting to this pow∣er, which our countrymen have not in the other case: that is, our case affects the conscience, as their's does not: and equal liberty of conscience is one essential article in our CHARTER, which constitutes this government, and describes the extent of our rulers authority, and what are the rights and liberties of the people. And in the confession of faith which our rulers and their mi∣nisters have published to the world, they say, <Q>God alone is Lord of the conscience, and hath left it free from the doctrines and command∣ments of men, which are, in <HI>any thing</HI> contra∣ry to his word; or <HI>not contained in it;</HI> so that to believe such doctrines, or to obey such commands, out of conscience, is to <HI>betray</HI> true liberty of conscience; and the requiring of an implicit faith, and an absolute blind obedience, is to destroy liberty of conscience and reason also.</Q></P>
<Q><P>And a most famous historian of their's, after mentioning some former violations of that liber∣ty, says, The great noise that hath been made in the world about the <HI>persecution</HI> made in New-England, I will now stop with only transcribing the words uttered in the sermon
<PB N="57" REF="012654_0056_0F8BBFA40315A088"/>
to the first great and general assembly of the Massachusetts-Bay, after the two colonies of Massachusetts and Plymouth were by Royal Charter united. (from 2 Chron. 12. 12.)</P>
<P>Things will <HI>go well,</HI> when magistrates are great promoters of the thing that good is, and what the Lord requireth of them. I do not mean that it would be well for the <HI>civil</HI> magistrate, with <HI>civil</HI> penalty to compel men to this or that <HI>way of worship,</HI> which they are <HI>conscientiously</HI> indisposed unto. He is most properly the officer of <HI>human society,</HI> and a chris∣tian by non-conformity to this or that <HI>imposed way of worship,</HI> does not break the terms on which he is to enjoy the benefits of human so∣ciety. A man has a <HI>right</HI> unto his life, his estate, his liberty, and his family, although he should not come up unto these and those blessed <HI>institutions</HI> of our Lord.—<HI>Violences</HI> may bring the erroneous to be hypocrites, but they will never bring them to be believ∣ers; no, they naturally prejudice men's minds against the <HI>cause,</HI> which is therein pretended for, as being a weak, a wrong, an evil cause.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Magnalia, B. 7. p. 28, 29.</NOTE></P></Q>
<P>These things were then delivered and were re∣ceived with the <HI>thanks</HI> of the house of representa∣tives, and ten years after were spread by the histo∣rian thro' the nation, with the express design of stoping any further complaints about New-Eng∣land's persecutions. But if the constitution of this government, gives the magistrate no other
<PB N="58" REF="012654_0057_0F8BBFA54D4D5988"/>
authority than what belongs to <HI>civil society,</HI> we desire to know how he ever came to <HI>impose</HI> any particular <HI>way of worship,</HI> upon any town or pre∣cinct whatsoever? And if a man has a right to his <HI>estate,</HI> his <HI>liberty</HI> and his <HI>family,</HI> notwithstand∣ing his non-conformity to the magistrates way of worship, by what authority has any man had his goods spoiled, his land sold, or his person im∣prisoned, and thereby deprived of the enjoyment both of his liberty and his family, for no crime at all against the peace or welfare of the state, but only because he refused to conform to, or to support an <HI>imposed</HI> way of worship, or an <HI>imposed</HI> minister.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Many pretend that without a tax to support ministers, the public would suffer for want of due encouragment of use∣ful learning. But <HI>human</HI> learning is surely as needful for phy∣sicians and lawyers as for <HI>spiritual</HI> teachers; and dare any deny that the affairs of law and physick fall more directly under the notice of the state than divinity does? why then do our legislature leave every man, and woman too, at liberty to choose their own lawyer and physician, and not oblige them either to employ or pay any other, though the majori∣ty may prefer them? Can any better reason be rendered for this difference in conduct than this, viz. It has been found to be an easier matter to <HI>impose</HI> upon people about their souls, than about their bodies or their temporal estates!</NOTE></P>
<P>In a celebrated oration for liberty, published last spring in Boston, a maxim was recited which carries it's own evidence with it, which is this, NO MAN CAN GIVE THAT WHICH IS ANOTHER'S. Yet have not our legislature from time to time, made acts to empower the major part of the in∣habitants in towns and precincts, to <HI>give away</HI> their neighbours estates to what ministers they
<PB N="59" REF="012654_0058_0F8BBFA5DBB19598"/>
please! And can we submit to such doctrines and commandments of men, and not <HI>betray</HI> true liberty of conscience! Every person is or ought to be, benefited by civil government, and there∣fore they owe rulers honor and a tribute on that account; but the like cannot be truly said of an imposed minister; for as the gospel ministry is an ordinance of God and not of man, so the obligation that any person or people are un∣der to obey and support any man as a minister of Christ, arises from the <HI>consideration</HI> of his ap∣pearing to them to resemble his Master in <HI>doctrine</HI> and <HI>conversation,</HI> and from the benefit which peo∣ple receive under their ministrations.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Heb. 12. 7, 17. Phil. 4. 9, 10. 1 Cor. 9. 11. Gal. 6. 6. 1 Tim. 5. 17. 18.</NOTE> From whence the law of equity makes the free com∣munications of our <HI>carnal things</HI> to Christ's mi∣nisters, to be a matter that as really concerns the exercise of a good conscience toward God, as prayer and praise do; for they are both called <HI>sacrifices</HI> to him in the same chapter. Heb. 13. 15, 16.</P>
<P>Thus we have laid before the public a brief view of our sentiments concerning liberty of conscience, and a little sketch of our sufferings on that account. If any can show us that we have made any mistakes, either about principles or facts, we would lie open to conviction: But we hope none will violate the forecited article of faith so much, as to require us to yield a <HI>blind obedience</HI> to them, or to expect that spoiling of
<PB N="60" REF="012654_0059_0F8BBFAAE342E2D0"/>
goods or imprisonment can move us to <HI>betray</HI> the cause of true liberty.</P>
<P>A late writer in the Boston papers, has taken much pains to prove, that some other colonies have imposed upon people in such affairs worse than New-England has; and to prove it he informs us, that an act for ministers mainten∣ance, was passed in New-York near eighty years ago, which succeeding rulers have turned to sup∣port a denomination that had very few represen∣tatives in court when the act was made, while the denomination who made it, have been deni∣ed any benefit from it. If so, how loud is the call to every man that is a friend to liberty, and who regards the good of posterity, to rise and ex∣ert all his influence, to demolish the engine which has done so much mischief in all ages! We are far from trying to represent the fathers of New-England as the worst of the colonists; We be∣lieve the contrary. But our veneration for their memory, is so far from reconciling us to, that it fills us with greater detestation of, that <HI>mystery of iniquity,</HI> which carried them into such acts of imposition and persecution as have left a great blemish upon their character. And since these are tedious things to dwell upon, we shall close with this remark.</P>
<P>The Massachusetts ministers, in their letter to governor Jencks and other baptists in Provi∣dence, said, We hope and pray that ancient mat∣ters that had <HI>acrimony</HI> unhappily in them may be buried in oblivion. Now we are told that
<PB N="61" REF="012654_0060_0F8BBFAD8B4C1AE8"/>
acrimony signifies that quality in one body whereby it corrodes, eats up or destroys another, This <HI>eating destroying</HI> quality is truly unhappy: but how can it be buried before it is dead? The worst of criminals are to be executed before they are buried. Therefore let this cruel <HI>man-eater</HI> be fairly executed, and we are ready to join heart and hand to bury him, and not to have a bone of him left for contention in all the land. If it be so hard to our opponents to hear of these matters, what has it been to those who have felt their eating and destroying influence for these hund∣red and forty years? And how can any person lift up his head before God or man, and say he hopes to have these things buried, if he at the same time holds fast, and tries hard to keep alive the procuring cause of them!</P>
<P>The foregoing appeal, having been examin∣ed and approved by many of his brethren, is presented to the public, by their humble ser∣vant,</P>

<P>SINCE the above was written, I have receiv∣ed direct accounts, that at Montague (whose case is mentioned p. 32.) they continue from time to time, to make distress upon the princi∣pal members of the baptist church there, whom the law directs to sign their certificates, while
<PB N="62" REF="012654_0061_0F8BBFAEA4DCCC50"/>
they let the rest of the society alone. Also that William White a regular member of the baptist church in Ashfield, who lives in Chesterfield, and has had his standing in said church certified ac∣cording to law; yet had a cow taken from him on August 25, 1773, and sold the 30th, for the pedobaptist ministers rate; and that in both of these places, the civil charges of the town, and the ministers salary are all blended in one tax (contrary as I am informed to the law of our province) so that our brethren who would readily pay their civil tax, yet cannot do it, without pay∣ing the ministers also. Now the grand pretence that is made for the use of the secular arm to support ministers is, that thereby <HI>equality</HI> is es∣tablished among the people; but what religion, equality or equity can there be in the above proceedings!</P>
