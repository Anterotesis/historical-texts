<P>by lingering sickness, or by sudden accident; wheth∣er at home amongst our friends, or abroad in dist∣ant lands, where none but strangers shall hear our dying groans. If the LORD be with us: if "the GOD of Jacob be our help," all will be well; we may safely close our eyes on all mortal enjoy∣ments, and leave the world in peace.</P>
<P>We are convened this day, my brethren, on a very singular occasion. Singular, at least, in the present age of the world. The life of MAN is placed at "three score years and ten." But we are met to commemorate the goodness of GOD to his <HI>aged servant,</HI> here present, whose life has been protracted to the uncommon period of a HUNDRED YEARS this day. With wonder and with grati∣tude, we hail such an unusual ANNIVERSARY. "Our FATHERS, where are they?" Gone to the world of immortality. But how few of them had arrived at this advanced age, before they quitted the stage of mortality!</P>
<P>It is the design of the present discourse, with∣out going into a particular consideration of the connexion in which the words stand with the con∣text, to take them as a distinct sentence, contain∣ing a very important truth, and to endeavour some improving reflections from them, suited to this occasion, and to the circumstances of the <HI>aged</HI> per∣son, present; and likewise to deduce such remarks, as may, by the blessing of GOD, be of general use and benefit to all.</P>
<P>There are TWO principal ideas held up to view, in the passage before us, to which your attention is invited.</P>
<P N="1">I. The first is, the <HI>frailty</HI> and <HI>mortality</HI> of man.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="7" REF="027630_0004_0FD5C58893946F98"/>II. The second, that there are certain cases and circumstances in human life, in which it may justly be said, "<HI>There is but a step between us and death.</HI>"</P>
<P N="1">1. We are naturally led to contemplate the <HI>frail∣ty</HI> and <HI>mortality</HI> of man. The term DEATH, in our text, is full of awful import. <HI>Here</HI> is the end, not of our existence: Happy, comparatively hap∣py for the wicked, the finally impenitent sinner, if it were so! But the end of all worldly joys and woes. <HI>Here</HI> is the entrance on a new, an untried state of existence, which will never end. What a subject this for serious reflection and improve∣ment! A subject equally interesting to the parent and the child, to the aged and the youth. Why then should "the living who know they must die, put far away that <HI>evil day?</HI>" A day, which they cannot, by all their efforts, ward off, nor by all their tears of anxiety and distress, avoid. An event, which will not be bribed, by all the riches of the world, to a moment's delay. For "who," or by what price, can a man "redeem his broth∣er, or give to GOD a ransom," that shall reprieve him from death?</P>
<P>When we take a view of the amazing havoc and destruction which that relentless enemy <HI>Death</HI> has made in our world, what a distressful reflection does it afford! It spares no age, sex or character. The prince on the throne and the beggar in his cottage, are alike subject to his awful power. The father and the son, the tender mother and the help∣less babe, must each feel his fatal shaft, and bow to death. Nay, this king of terrors shews no more favour to the virtuous than to the profligate.
<PB N="8" REF="027630_0005_0FD5556C20CF8D28"/>
The righteous and the wicked, the saint and the sinner, must equally fall before him, and submit to his dreadful sceptre. For "it is appointed to all," all without distinction, "once to die." Hap∣py, my friends, if <HI>but once!</HI> For we are informed in the sacred word, of a "<HI>second</HI> death." A death, far more terrible than that of the body. It means the death of the soul; which term, in the language of scripture, is figuratively used to signi∣fy its eternal separation from GOD, and from all happiness; to a state of endless darkness and mis∣ery. But blessed be GOD, the same divine word does also inform us, that <HI>this</HI> death may be avoid∣ed. For it is written, "Blessed and holy are they that have part in the first resurrection, for on such the <HI>second death</HI> hath no power." Who are these privileged ones? it will be natural to inquire. Who, these happy souls, on whom that dreadful calamity shall never fall? The sacred word des∣cribes them, as the holy "followers of the Lamb." None but the friends and followers of JESUS, who have chosen him with all their hearts, for their Saviour and their King, will be distinguish∣ed with this glorious privilege of eternal exemp∣tion from the <HI>second</HI> death. For them, the Sa∣viour hath "abolished death," and will enable them to triumph over it as a conquered enemy, in the lively hope of a blessed immortality. But, from the <HI>first</HI> death, there is no escape. "There is no discharge in that war." This is an enemy which has, ever since the apostacy of man, been going on from conquering to conquer; and will finally subdue the whole of our fallen race.</P>
<P>What a melancholy picture is presented to our
<PB N="9" REF="027630_0006_0FD5556D9C4F3140"/>
minds, if we only take a view of the awful ravage and desolation this enemy is making at the <HI>present day,</HI> among the contending armies in <HI>Europe;</HI> where the horrid "noise of war and garments rolled in blood" are the constant theme; the daily objects before their eyes! Oh! how doth humanity shudder at the thought of whole hecatombs of human lives immolated at the shrine of ambition and the accursed lust of empire! Or sacrificed to glut the vengeance of despotic tyrants, or to ap∣pease the wild, the unhappy ravings of a tempo∣rary enthusiasm! In either view it must be, to ev∣ery feeling mind, a distressing reflection! Painful beyond expression, that there should be such a thoughtless, such an impious waste of human blood, as if it were of no more value, than that of beasts of slaughter! Oh! what a tremendous reckoning must the aggressors, the criminal authors of such destruction and misery, have hereafter! and what an awful account must they give up, in the great day of dread decision! in that day, when thrones and sceptres shall no longer protect the ty∣rant from justice, nor lawless power shield the mur∣derer from the vengeance of a righteous GOD!</P>
<P>But while we contemplate with horror, these scenes of destruction, in fields of battle; we are ready to inquire, is it <HI>there</HI> only, that the enemy death is making desolation? Alas! no. He comes, with resistless force, into the peaceful hab∣itations of domestic security and friendship; and often spreads a melancholy gloom over whole families. A tender husband, an affectionate wife, is snatched from the embraces of the sorrowful partner. The hapless child is left a solitary
<PB N="10" REF="027630_0007_0FD5556F56C6A0A0"/>
orphan, bereft of the guide of its youth. And how often does the tender parent mourn the untimely death of his offspring, cut down in the morning of life! But such is the will of heav∣en; who saith, "Be still and know that I am GOD." He hath righteously ordained that the reign of death should be universal, and all must, sooner or later, fall before it. The time when, the place where, or the means by which this event will take place, are exceedingly various; all, par∣ticularly ordered by the wise disposing providence of GOD, and as wisely kept a secret from mortals, reserved in the breast of infinite wisdom and good∣ness. Yet it is an event to which mankind are liable, every moment. Which leads us to the SECOND thing proposed, viz.</P>
<P>That there are certain circumstances in human life, and in which it may be truly said, "there is but a <HI>step</HI> between us death." The inquiry here, naturally is, <HI>when</HI> do these cases occur and what are those circumstances, and who the persons, of whom it can be affirmed with truth, that they are within "a step" of death? In answer, the following things are observed.</P>
<P>FIRST, The assertion is strictly true, in a sense, of ALL our dying race. They walk every day, by the brink of the grave, by the very gates of the eternal world. It is but a <HI>breath</HI> that separates us from the invisible state. "For what is our life but a <HI>vapour,</HI> that appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth away." Surely "man at his best estate is altogether vanity." "He giveth up the Ghost, and where is he?"</P>
<P>SECONDLY, The truth in our text, may, with
<PB N="11" REF="027630_0008_0FD5C589F25010E0"/>
special propriety, be applied to that class of men, "who go down to the sea in ships, who do busi∣ness in great waters." Our SEAFARING BRETH∣REN are an order of citizens, important indeed to society, and whose <HI>calling</HI> is both lawful and ne∣cessary. But every one knows it is also an haz∣ardous one. Do they wisely reflect on the dan∣gers that surround them? Are they sensible on what precarious ground they stand every moment while pursuing their business on the mighty billows? That "there is but a step," a <HI>plank,</HI> "between them and death." How important, how serious is the reflection! What a solemn argument to con∣vince them of the necessity of religion, of recon∣ciliation to GOD, and of actual readiness for death; that if it should be sudden, it may not come un∣expected, nor meet them with surprise; which leads us to observe,</P>
<P>THIRDLY, How many SUDDEN ACCIDENTS, in the daily course of life, verify the words of our text, and are an awakening proof that "there is but a <HI>step</HI> between us and death." An <HI>apoplexy,</HI> a <HI>fall,</HI> a <HI>blow,</HI> a <HI>wound,</HI> and sometimes a sudden burst of <HI>violent passion,</HI> have, in an instant snapped asunder the brittle thread of life, and swiftly hur∣ried the soul into the eternal world. Such events are by no means uncommon. How frequently do we read and hear of them? How often too, do mankind experience narrow, even <HI>hairbreadth</HI> es∣capes from instant death? when, to appearance, a miracle alone could have preserved them. That such cases do not more frequently prove fatal, and that our lives are not taken away by innumerable accidents, to which we are daily exposed, is to be
<PB N="12" REF="027630_0009_0FD55572F37B4E58"/>
ascribed to nothing but the immediate, constant interposition of GOD, whose powerful and mer∣ciful hand upholds us, each moment of life. I doubt not, that while I am now speaking, there are numbers here present, who can testify, from their own experience, to the truth of these observ∣ations, who, this moment, recollect the day, the place, the circumstance, in which they narrowly escaped being instantly deprived of life, and sent quickly into eternity. But the LORD was mer∣ciful, and has spared you yet a little longer. Let it not be, to fill up a greater measure of sin; but, O! may your gratitude to GOD be as signal, as was your deliverance!</P>
<P>FOURTHLY, A SICK BED has often witnessed the truth of our text, that "there is but a step between us and death." Can none of us affirm this also, from our own experience? Have we not been, by a violent <HI>fever,</HI> by excruciating <HI>pain,</HI> or, by more <HI>slow discase,</HI> reduced to the very verge of life; our friends weeping around us, hourly expecting to see us breathe our last; physicians are of no avail, the disorder baffles their utmost skill, all hopes of recovery seemed to be gone, and in our own apprehension, if we had our senses, all the prospect was, vast, boundless, amazing eter∣nity! When, all on a sudden, by an unexpected and unaccountable turn of the disease, we were, as if by the immediate voice of GOD, called back again to life, snatched as from the borders of the pit, ransomed from the grave, and at a moment, when it might, with truth be said, "There was but a <HI>step</HI> between us and death."</P>
<P>Once more, <HI>fifthly;</HI> with peculiar propriety,
<PB N="13" REF="027630_0010_0FD555746282E660"/>
may the expression in the text be applied to those who are far advanced in OLD AGE. We know, indeed, that no age in life is exempt from the stroke of death. The youth who is now sporting in all the pleasures and gaieties of juvenile years, may be in his grave, before the <HI>man</HI> whom we here be∣hold, bowed under the weight of years. It is not unusual that the fairest blooms are soonest cropt, by the cold hand of relentless death. But when a person has arrived at his <HI>threescore and ten,</HI> there seems to be a moral certainty of a speedy dissolu∣tion. His hoary hairs and enfeebled limbs daily admonish him that it is but "a <HI>step</HI>" that divides him from the congregation of the dead, from "the house appointed for all the living." Every hour tells him, the sands in his glass are just run out, that his "days are numbered, and almost finished." O how proper, how important, that those who have arrived at <HI>old age,</HI> should set loose from this world and all the enjoyments, cares, frowns and flatteries of it, view themselves as at the door of the grave, live in daily expectation of the summons that will call them into the world of spirits; and give all diligence that they be found in readiness for their last remove.</P>
<P>Having briefly suggested some observations from the passage before us, in a doctrinal way, I poceed to the</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="improvement">
<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>A variety of useful remarks might be drawn from this interesting subject. I shall confine my∣self, and ask your attention only to a few of them, at this time.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="14" REF="027630_0011_0FD55575DFE2FAA8"/>1st, It naturally leads us, in the first place, to a <HI>humbling</HI> reflection on the weak, miserable state of man, in consequence of his guilty apostacy from GOD. Here is the baneful source of all our woe. To this fountain, we may trace all those bitter streams of sorrow, pain, misery and death, which spread such a dark and gloomy shade over this fallen world. From this source, have proceeded those rivers of blood which have deluged the earth; by wars, persecutions, oppressions, tyrannies, by anarchy, fanaticism and superstition; which, at different periods of time, have so much disgraced humanity and distressed the world. From the same cause have arisen all those bitter animosities, feuds and dissentions which have disturbed the happiness of societies, discord and variance in families, hatred and strife among individuals; in a word, all the unnumbered calamities that have befallen mankind from generation to generation, down to this day. They have all taken their rise from man's sinful de∣parture from his GOD. Nor do the evils terminate here. They are not confined to the present life. Those endless miseries in the future world, which await the wicked, and the finally impenitent sin∣ner, are but the just fruit and "wages of sin." But while we contemplate the dismal effects of sin, both in this and the coming world, what cause have we,</P>
<P N="2">2dly, To adore the infinite wisdom and goodness of GOD, that there is a foundation laid in the gos∣pel for <HI>hope</HI> even in <HI>death.</HI> That the consideration of the <HI>certainly</HI> of death, does not, necessarily land the mind in the region of <HI>hopeless</HI> despondency. Blessed be GOD, that although we <HI>must</HI> die, yet
<PB N="15" REF="027630_0012_0FD5C586EA9D1E60"/>
we <HI>may</HI> live again, and live a new, a better life, be∣yond the grave: a life of glorious immortality and joy; where sorrow and death shall reign no more for ever. For these hopes and this happiness, we are entirely and exclusively indebted to the gos∣pel of Christ. This has brought "life and im∣mortality to light." Here we find that "JESUS is the resurrection and the life;" and that he that "believeth in HIM, though he were dead, yet shall he live."</P>
<P>It is, indeed, a solemn thing to exchange worlds, to go from time into eternity. The way through death is a <HI>dark valley,</HI> but JESUS can enlighten this passage. He has once, himself, passed through it. For he was dead, and behold he is alive, and liv∣eth forevermore, Amen; and hath the keys of hell and of death." It is through this <HI>door</HI> of death that he has appointed all his friends shall follow him to glory. He will not therefore, "leave or forsake them," when they shall come to it. He has, by travelling through the dark valley himself, sweetened the passage for all his children, who come after him. So that many of them have cheerfully ventured into it, leaning upon the promise of their GOD and Saviour, and from sweet experience, have been ready to adopt those comfortable lines,
<Q><L>"JESUS can make a dying bed,</L>
<L>Feel soft as downy pillows are,</L>
<L>While on his breast I lean my head,</L>
<L>And breathe my life out sweetly there."</L></Q></P>
<P>Have you never, my brethren, within your own observation, had occasion to witness this truth; in the triumphant departure of some, who, in their <HI>last hours</HI> have enjoyed unspeakable serenity of mind, if not transported with the lively hope of
<PB N="16" REF="027630_0013_0FD5557A29ED3720"/>
glory? Although, <HI>perhaps,</HI> a little before, or during their sickness, they were in great darkness and fear, respecting their state. They wept, they trembled at the awful prospect before them. Yet, through the goodness of a faithful GOD, before they left the world, the clouds dispersed, the everlasting moun∣tains appeared; the tear of distress was wiped from their eyes, by the gentle hand of their compas∣sionate Saviour, and the sting of the dreaded mon∣ster, was rendered pointless and easy, by the balmy supports of the gospel, and the sweet "consola∣tions of CHRIST," in their expiring moments. Are these the blessed effects of a hope founded on the <HI>gospel?</HI> O! with what ardour of gratitude should we join the Apostle, and say, "Thanks be to GOD for this unspeakable gift."</P>
<P N="3">3dly, The subject teaches us that death, or mere∣ly <HI>dying</HI> is, by no means the principal thing we have to fear in that solemn hour. There is some∣thing infinitely more dreadful than death, which is SIN. It is <HI>this,</HI> and this only, that clothes death with its principal horrors.</P>
<P>There is, indeed, something terrible and abhor∣rent to nature, in the thoughts of dying. Nature shrinks from the dissolution, dreads the painful stroke which separates the soul from the body, and all its tender earthly connexions. But the apostle tells us, "the <HI>sting</HI> of death is SIN." It is <HI>this</HI> that arms it with terror. When <HI>this</HI> is taken away by the pardoning mercy of GOD, through the precious blood of Jesus, death is stripped of its gloom, and becomes the friendly messenger, sent by the blessed Saviour, to call his children home to those "mansions in his Father's house, which
<PB N="17" REF="027630_0014_0FD523A852121558"/>
he went, as their forerunner, to prepare for them." They meet him therefore with courage; some∣times with a transport of joy, saying, "O death where is thy sting! Thanks be to GOD who giv∣eth me the victory, through our Lord JESUS CHRIST." Which leads me to remark,</P>
<P N="4">4thly. The subject points out the <HI>only</HI> safe sound∣ation of <HI>hope</HI> in death, viz. JESUS CHRIST. This, this is the "chief corner stone," on which you and I, my hearers, must rest our hope, if ever we expect to meet death with comfort and safety. "Other foundation can no man lay." The con∣flict will be inexpressibly terrible, without the pre∣sence of Christ, without the almighty support of his love and power. Every other foundation will assuredly fail. Where else would you look for sup∣port? Shall you place confidence in your having been educated in a christian country, and brought up under the light of the gospel? Or will you build your hopes on your good intentions and re∣solutions, on your prayers, tears and religious per∣formances? Or dare you venture your all for eter∣nity, on your having made a profession of relig∣ion and attended the ordinances of the gospel? In a word, will you trust to your works of righteous∣ness, or your deeds of charity? These props are too weak to support a dying man, or give com∣fort to a soul just launching into eternity, and about to appear before a holy God. Be assured, that if you have no better foundation than <HI>these,</HI> your "expectation will perish;" these will all sink from under you, and prove as mere "refuges of lies," which will be swept all away by the be∣som of death, and will leave you hopeless, wretch∣ed and undone forever.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="027630_0015_0FD5557CA280EA90"/>But if on the other hand, your hope rests on this "Rock of ages" JESUS CHRIST alone, if your confidence is built on the ground of that everlasting righteousness which he has wrought out, that complete atonement he hath made for sin; "nei∣ther life nor <HI>death</HI> can separate you from the love" and eternal enjoyment "of God;" nor can "the gates of hell prevail against you."</P>
<P>THE GREAT CONCERN, therefore, the all im∣portant inquiry, my hearers, is, have <HI>we,</HI> or have we not, built our HOPE on <HI>this</HI> foundation? The subject before us, as well as the occasion, render such an examination peculiarly suitable and im∣portant, not to one more than to another; but to <HI>all,</HI> of whatever age, class, or condition, of life. Are we not all mortal? Do we know the day of our death, or the length of time that infinite wisdom has allotted us for our probation here? Are we certain that the term has not nearly expired? And are we secure one hour, or moment, from the arrest of death?</P>
<P>It has been observed, and justly, that the words of our text are truly, applicable to every one; that "There is but a <HI>step</HI> between us and death." That "our life is but a <HI>vapour,</HI>" and who can tell when, or how suddenly, that vapour shall be driven away? Without doubt, it will be much sooner, with many, than they now expect.</P>
<P>Are any of you, now in the <HI>prime</HI> of life; in the vigour of <HI>youth?</HI> Will <HI>this</HI> prove a security against the stroke of death? Look to yonder, <HI>Gol∣gotha,</HI> and see the graves of many a <HI>lovely youth,</HI> snatched from their fond parents in the morning of life; youths, who as little thought of dying as you do this day, until the fatal summons came.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="027630_0016_0FD5557E1EFA30E8"/>Are others of you in the <HI>meridian</HI> of life, involv∣ed in the cares of a family, and busily engaged in worldy schemes and pursuits? And are <HI>you</HI> sure that your sun will not set before the evening of old age, or that your present engagements shall not be interrupted by an unexpected call into the eternal world? Are you sure that the awful words pronounced by the prophet to <HI>Hannaniah,</HI> will not be verified in you, "This year thou shalt die!" What frequent admonitions have we, by the year∣ly, and daily calls of one and another from us by death, to "prepare to meet our GOD," "lest coming suddenly, he find us sleeping."</P>
<P>Let the solemn question then, be brought home to our bosoms. Am I prepared for that <HI>step</HI> which will usher my immortal spirit into the im∣mediate presence of my maker, GOD? Have I, at present, <HI>any</HI> hope at all, on which I make depend∣ance? If so, is my hope any thing better than "the spider's web," or the "hope of the hypo∣crite, which will perish when GOD takes away my soul." On what ground am I building for eternity? Is it on the <HI>sandy</HI> foundation of mere <HI>morality,</HI> or my own good works? Is it on an empty <HI>profession</HI> of godliness? Or upon some favour∣ite <HI>name,</HI> party, denomination or distinction among men? Is it upon transient <HI>affections,</HI> sudden <HI>im∣pulses,</HI> or <HI>flashes of joy,</HI> like those of the "stony ground hearers?" Are <HI>these</HI> the foundation on which I am building my eternal hopes? Or, is it up∣on that firm, that immoveable ROCK, <HI>Christ Jesus?</HI> Have I ever deeply felt my perishing need of this foundation? my utter depravity, guilt and help∣lessness; the righteousness of that law that con∣demns
<PB N="20" REF="027630_0017_0FD5C58CF70A60B8"/>
the transgressor of it to eternal punishment, for every instance of violation? Gal. iii. 10. Have I been convinced of the entire insufficiency of all "works of rigteousness which I have done," or can do to make the least atonement for my sins, or procure my pardon and acceptance with a holy and just GOD? And being divinely enlightened, have, I "fled for refuge" to the perfect and glo∣rious atonement of CHRIST, as "the only hope set before me?" Have I seen the safety, the al∣sufficiency of this foundation, so as cordially to trust in it for my whole salvation; that I can humbly say, in the language of the prophet, "in the Lord have I righteousness and strength?"</P>
<P>And is my hope of that kind, that it "<HI>purifies</HI> me, even as HE is pure?" Am I become, indeed, a "New creature?" Have "old things passed away?" If I have experienced a change of <HI>heart,</HI> is it manifested by a change of <HI>life?</HI> by a studi∣ous care to "deny all ungodliness and every worldly lust, and to live soberly, righteously and godly in the world?" THESE are the scriptural marks of a real christian. If <HI>these</HI> are found in us, my brethren, WE are christians: And have just ground of "rejoicing in the hope of the glory of GOD." And death, how soon or suddenly soever it may come, can do us no harm: we shall fall asleep in Jesus.</P>
<P>But if not, in the name of GOD, it is high time to awake and look to our standing. For it is, in∣deed, on "slippery places;" and "there is but a STEP between us and death." And if "our feet should slide," while in the present condition, un∣der an insupportable load of guilt, the weight will
<PB N="21" REF="027630_0018_0FD55582D1A793B8"/>
inevitably plunge us into a state of remediless woe, of endless ruin. On the other hand, how joyful, how glorious is the prospect which a good hope in Christ presents to the dying christian! Cheer∣fully may he look forward to the departing hour, and with sweet serenity adopt the sacred triumph of the apostle, "I am more than a conqueror through him that hath loved me."</P>
<P N="5">5thly. But I now close the discourse, by a more particular application of the subject to that aged, <HI>very aged</HI> person, on whose account we are convened this day; and at whose request I stand here on this occasion.</P>
<P>How great, <HI>venerable Father!</HI> how distinguish∣ing is the goodness of that merciful GOD, who has upheld you through all the vicissitudes of a long life, and has lengthened out your days to this remarkable period! What millions of inhabitants have been swept off from the earth, since you came upon the stage of life! and how few COE∣VALS have you in our world! With what wonder and gratitude have you cause to look back upon the varied scene of life you have passed through, and upon the revolutions and changes you have seen, since the days of youth! Changes in the <HI>nat∣ural</HI> world; changes, surprizing changes in the <HI>political,</HI> and in the <HI>moral</HI> world. To us, Sir, es∣pecially to our rising youth, the race of life you have run, appears very long indeed. But not so to you, as you have told me, but a mere <HI>span.</HI> Upon a retrospective view of it, methinks you are ready to say, with the aged patriarch, when the curious question was put to him by Pharaoh, "How old art thou?" In reply, "<HI>Few</HI> and evil
<PB N="22" REF="027630_0019_0FD55584F9D35C28"/>
have the days of the years of my life been." You cannot, however, add, as in the next words, that "you have not attained to the years of the life of your <HI>fathers,</HI> in the days of their pilgrimage;" for you have exceeded them <HI>all,</HI> and almost all upon the present stage of action.</P>
<P>A rare sight! my brethren, our eyes behold, this day! A fellow citizen, who has survived a <HI>century!</HI> Born when <HI>New-England</HI> was in its childhood; when <HI>America</HI> was, comparatively, a wilderness; but about SEVENTY YEARS after the landing of our <HI>forefathers</HI> in PLYMOUTH, the place of his birth. May the unusual sight suita∣bly affect our minds, and excite serious and grate∣ful reflections on the wonderful power, goodness, patience and tender mercy of GOD to his creatures!</P>
<P>And while you, AGED FATHER, with good old JACOB, acknowledge, with a grateful heart, "the GOD that hath fed you all your life long," may you not, with peculiar propriety, now, at the close of a long life, adopt the words of DAVID in the text, and say, "There is but a <HI>step</HI> between me and death!" an important step indeed. You will naturally, on this occasion (as far as the en∣feebled powers of your mind, which are necessa∣rily impaired by age, will permit) be led to con∣template the great, the interesting change that lies just before you; and the awful importance of be∣ing found in actual readiness for it. You have "heard and learned" from the gospel, what that foundation is, on which alone, you, and we all, can with safety build our hopes, and die in peace. And that "other foundation can no man lay, than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ." The all-per∣fect
<PB N="23" REF="027630_0020_0FD55587ACA50420"/>
atonement made, and the everlasting righte∣ousness brought in by HIM, is that Rock, on which you may, with infinite security and satisfaction depend, when you shall be called to take that <HI>last step</HI> which will introduce your unbodied spirit in∣to a world of untried and immortal existence. On <HI>this</HI> ground, never did one fail, or come short of heaven. On <HI>this</HI> foundation then, fix, immuta∣bly fix your faith and hope. Then, may you, with patience and serenity of soul, "all the days of your appointed time wait, till your change comes," when, with a gentle stroke, the messen∣ger death shall give you a peaceful dismission from earth to "a brighter world on high." And in the mean time, may you, the few intervening days that heaven may allot you, between this and the parting hour, be enabled to adopt the words of "Paul the <HI>aged,</HI>" and say "I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand, henceforth is laid up for me, a crown of righteous∣ness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge will give me in that day, and not to me only, but to all them also that love his appearing."</P>
<P>FINALLY, brethren and friends, all, who have met here this day and on this occasion, the singu∣lar event which has called us together, is adapted to excite very useful and improving reflections in the minds of both old and young. It is very im∣probable we shall ever meet again on a <HI>similar,</HI> and perhaps never, all of us, on <HI>any</HI> occasion. This, be it as it may, is of very small importance, com∣pared with one of infinitely greater moment. Nor is it material at what age or period of life, we quit mortality, whether in youth, in manhood, or at
<PB N="24" REF="027630_0021_0FD5C5A38D198FB8"/>
the age of a <HI>hundred</HI> years. The only important point is, that our peace be made with God, by virtue of a real, a vital union with the Lord Jesus Christ. Without <HI>this,</HI> all our hopes are vain, and will end in fearful disappointment, at the hour of death. For it is written, "the sinner, though an hundred years old, shall be accursed." But "precious in the sight of the Lord, is the <HI>death</HI> of his saints," and "mark the perfect man, and be∣hold the upright, for the <HI>end</HI> of that man is peace." To the soul united to Jesus, death will prove the welcome harbinger of endless joys.</P>
<P>Be it therefore, our great, our only concern, to secure this blessedness. To this end, let us hearken to, and comply with the calls of the gospel, im∣prove the fleeting moments of life to the glory of GOD, and in "serving our generation according to his will;" and then, when life shall close, we shall be gathered to our <HI>fathers</HI> in peace. Our bodies shall lie down in that mansion of silent re∣pose, "where the wicked cease from troubling;" and our souls, through the merits of our divine Redeemer, shall be received to that eternal "Rest that remaineth for the people of GOD."</P>
