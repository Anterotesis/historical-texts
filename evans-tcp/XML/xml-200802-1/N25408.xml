<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE nature and purpose of this publi∣cation will be sufficiently explained by the following extract of a letter from DR GRE∣GORY, in Scotland, to the Editor.</P>
<P>"I HAVE now perused, with great attention and much pleasure, the translation of DR. FAUST's Catechism of Health, which you put into my hands a few days ago. I adhere to the favourable opinion of it which I expressed to you after
<PB N="vi" REF="033718_0004_0FF91442BA062810"/>reading only two or three pages of it when you first shewed it me; and as in reading it over carefully, I put my marks either of assent and approbation, or of dissent, or of doubt, to almost every proposition in it; I can say, with confidence, that I think it a work of very extraordinary merit, and one that, if it were generally known in this country, might be of infinite use. It is, indeed, the best popular medical work I ever read: nor do I in the least wonder at the extensive distribution, and the high estimation of it in Germany.</P>
<P>To the best of my judgment it con∣tains more solid good sense, and more useful information, in less bulk, than any medical book I ever saw, from the Aphorisms of Hippocrates to your last edi∣tion of the Family Physician inclusive;
<PB N="vii" REF="033718_0005_0FF91445728B1640"/>and, what I reckon of very great conse∣quence, there is less mixture of nonsense in it, which might either confound or mislead those for whose use it is intend∣ed.</P>
<P>I highly approve your benevolent purpose of reprinting it here, and diffusing it as generally as possible.</P>
<P>I think you should print a great many copies on the cheapest paper, that the poor people may afford to purchase it, or, that those in more affluent circumstances may be encouraged to purchase great numbers of them, and to distribute them among their poor neighbours. By all means print a good number in the handsomest manner on the finest paper, to tempt fine people to buy and to read it.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="033718_0006_0FF8C435CA8A5958"/>If you think my name and recommenda∣tion can be of any use in promoting the distribution of such a work, you are heartily welcome to use them in the most public manner, or even to print this letter at the beginning of it. Nay more, if you please, I will revise it, and superintend the printing of it, and correct the press.</P>
<P>If you approve of this, you must publish it under the title of "<HI>Selection</HI> from the Catechism of Health of DR. FAUST, trans∣lated from the German, and now publish∣ed for the use of the Inhabitants of Scot∣land:" you may say revised by me if you please. I should in that case abridge it considerably, by omitting some things which appear to me erroneous, or doubtful, or useless, or whimsical; or not suited to the
<PB N="ix" REF="033718_0007_0FF9144CECC91E50"/>state and manners of the people of this country.</P>
<P>DR. FAUST you will observe has some whims: for example, about the very free use of potatoes hurting the under∣standing: Sulphur ointment being dan∣gerous to health, &amp;c. (I even suspect an error in the translation there, of <HI>sulphur</HI> for <HI>mercurial</HI>; which rashly used is very dangerous, and may even have those very bad effects which are imputed to the sulphur, and which I never knew sulphur produce.)</P>
<P>There are several errors, and some very obscure passages in the translation; evidently proceeding from the Transla∣tor's
<PB N="x" REF="033718_0008_0FF9144FD26945A8"/><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was translated into English by MR. DASSE, himself, a German.</NOTE> imperfect knowledge of the Eng∣lish language, (<HI>luxes,</HI> for <HI>luxuries, re∣pulses,</HI> for <HI>repels, heavy,</HI> for <HI>severe,</HI> and so forth.) These I should, of course, correct in reprinting it.</P>
<P>The plan for extirpating the small∣pox, &amp;c. I should omit as impracti∣cable, at least in this country, at this time. I doubt whether it ever can suc∣ceed: But supposing the Author to be perfectly right, this is not a time for such a plan: And people should be told, not always what is absolutely best in itself, but what is the best that they <HI>can</HI> or <HI>will</HI> do: For example, as to the small-pox, universal inoculation, and the
<PB N="xi" REF="033718_0009_0FF9145250460018"/>cool regimen: And as to strong liquor, not abstaining from it altogether, (as certainly would be best,) but only getting drunk with ale or porter, instead of whisky and gin, which are absolute ruin to them in mind, body, and estate.</P>
<P>The form of Catechism by no means does justice to the strong good sense, the found morality, and the rational piety of DR. FAUST: Nor can it make that strong and pleasing impres∣sion, which classical composition would do, on readers of a cultivated taste: But his sentiments need not the aid of ornament: And the form of Catechism, and his frequent, and seemingly needless, repetitions are probably well suited to the state and habits of those for whose use chiefly his work is designed. They will
<PB N="xii" REF="033718_0010_0FF914574A34FDC8"/>tend to assist the memory, and to make the impression stronger; as well as to ena∣ble the people to apply the precepts easily and readily. Therefore, as he made it at first a Catechism, so let it remain."</P>
<P>The Editor has only to add, that the selection proposed has been made, and the printing of it revised, by DR. GRE∣GORY, according to his promise.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>I. Of Health; its Value, and the Duty of pre∣serving it, and of instructing Mankind, par∣ticularly Children, in these important Sub∣jects.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 1. DEAR Children, to breathe, to live in this world, created by God, is it an advantage? Is it to enjoy hap∣piness and pleasure?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes. To live is to enjoy happiness and pleasure; for life is a precious gift of the Almighty.</P>
<P>Ps. cl. 6. Let every thing that has breath praise the Lord.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="033718_0016_0FF9146C946E0E88"/>Ps. cxlv. 16. Thou, O Lord, satisfiest the desire of every thing living.</P>
<P>Ps. xxxvi. 5, 8. Thy mercy, O Lord, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds. They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shall make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.</P>
<P>Ps. cxxxvi. 1, 8, 9, 25. O give thank unto the Lord, for he is good. To him that made the sun to rule by the day; the moon and stars to rule by night; who gives food to all flesh: For his mercy endureth for ever.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 2. What other proofs have we to shew that life is an excellent gift of God?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The instinct, or natural anxiety of mankind to preserve it.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 3. What must be the state of the hu∣man body, the habitation and slave of the soul, that man may enjoy a long, prosperous and happy life?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It must be healthy.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 4. How else can you prove that man ought to be in a good state of health?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By the commandment of God, <HI>viz.</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="033718_0017_0FF914700B74C128"/><Q>In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread.</Q>
Gen. iii. 19.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 5. Can we possibly promote the per∣fection and happiness of our souls, if we do not take proper care of our bodies.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No. God has so intimately united soul and body, that by a rational care taken of the body, the happiness and purity of the soul is increased.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 6. What is understood by a state of good health?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That the body is free from pains and infirmities, fulfils its duties cheerfully and with ease, and is always obedient to the soul.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 7. How does he feel who enjoys health?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Strong; full of vigour and spirits; he relishes his meals; is not affected by wind and weather; goes through exercise and la∣bour with ease, and feels himself always happy.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 8. And what are the sensations of the sick? Are they like those we have described?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By no means; the sick man feels him∣self weak and languid; he has no appetite; he cannot work, nor brave wind and wea∣ther;
<PB N="4" REF="033718_0018_0FF91476AD4A67F8"/>he labours under continual anxiety and pains, and very few are the pleasures of his life.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 9. Can you children be merry and laugh, joke, and jump about, eat, drink, and sleep, when you are ill?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No We can only do so when we are in good health.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>If a child be present who was ill not long ago, the Master will take the oppor∣tunity of asking him the following question:—"You was ill; tell me did you feel yourself so happy, so easy as you do now?" To this a sensible child will answer, or will will be taught to answer—"I found myself exceed∣ingly ill, I could neither eat, drink, nor sleep; nothing afforded me plea∣sure or joy; I was full of anxiety and pains; but now restored to health; thanks be to God, I know it is the greatest good."</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 10. The blessings of health then must be very great?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They are indeed. Health is the most
<PB N="5" REF="033718_0019_0FF91478486F7C20"/>precious good, and the most certain means of enjoying all other blessings and pleasures of life.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 11. What says Sirach of health?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> In the 30th Chapter, v. 14, 15, 16, he says, "Better is the poor being sound and strong of constitution, than a rich man that is afflicted in his body. Health and good estate of body are above all gold, and a strong body above infinite wealth. There are no riches above a sound body, and no joy above the joy of the heart.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 12. Cannot the sick as well as the heal∣thy, enjoy the blessings and pleasures of life?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No. They have no charms for the sick.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 13. Of what use then is all worldly happiness to him who is sick, and cannot enjoy it?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Of very little use, if any.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 14. If then health be the most preci∣ous boon of life, what duties has a man in that respect to discharge towards himself?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He must strive to preserve it.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 15. Is it sufficient if he take care of his own health?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No. It is also his duty to take care of the life and health of his fellow-creatures.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="033718_0020_0FF8C45895CE0418"/><HI>Q.</HI> 16. And what is the duty of parents towards their children?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They are bound to take the tenderest care of their health and life.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>School-masters and parents ought to seize every opportunity of impressing on the minds of their children, the great importance of the invaluable blessings of health, and the conse∣quent duty to preserve it, by innocent pleasures, conducive to health. They ought on the other hand, to point out the mournful instances of multiplied sor∣rows and miseries which present them∣selves daily to our view, in the persons of the sick and diseased.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 17. Do they fulfil this duty?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Very seldom.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 18. Why so seldom?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. Because few of them are sensible of the real value of health.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="7" REF="033718_0021_0FF9147DD909A718"/>2. Most of them are ignorant of the struc∣ture and state of the human body.</P>
<P N="3">3. Equally ignorant of what is condu∣cive or hurtful to health.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 19. What is the cause of this igno∣rance?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The want of proper instructions.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 20. But as God wills the happiness of all mankind, should they not be brought from ignorance to the knowledge of truth?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes. It would be right, good, and dutiful to instruct every body, particularly little children like us, and to teach us the structure of the human body, and the best means of perserving health.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 21. Is it not, therefore, your duty to pay the greatest attention to the instructions which you are now to receive, respecting the most valuable boon of life?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We shall exert ourselves to the utmost to understand and to remember them.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 22. Is it sufficient to receive those in∣structions, and to remember them?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No. We should also strictly conform ourselves to those instructions.</P>

<HEAD>II. Of the Duration of Life, and the Signs of Health.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 23. WHAT is the usual period of human life?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Life is the best gift of God to man, who ought to enjoy it a very long time, and therefore live to an old age, as was in∣tended.</P>
<P>Ps. lxxxx. 10. The days of our life are threescore years and ten, and by reason of strength they be fourscore years.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 24. What has God promised as the greatest earthly reward to those that honour father and mother, and keep his command∣ments?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That their days shall be long upon the land, which the Lord our God gives them.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 25. How long is man destined to en∣joy health?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He ought to live almost uninterrupt∣edly in a perfect state of health.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="033718_0023_0FF9148A5CD05BA8"/><HI>Q.</HI> 26. What epithet is applied to a man who only, at intervals, suffers little incon∣veniencies from a short illness?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The epithet <HI>healthy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 27. What epithet is applied to a man who is not only weak, but also spends the greatest part of his life on the bed of sickness?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The epithet <HI>unhealthy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 28. What are the signs of an unin∣terrupted state of health, enjoyed by a man at the age of maturity?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The fresh and healthy colour of his face, the quickness of his senses, the strength of his bones, and the firmness of his flesh; large veins full of blood; a large and full breast; the power of breath∣ing slowly and deep without coughing; eating with hunger, and digesting well; taking much exercise, and bearing con∣tinued labour without fatigue; sleeping quietly and soundly, and enjoying cheer∣fulness of mind and serenity of counte∣nance; all denote an uninterrupted state of health.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>All aliment ought to consist of solid sub∣stances,
<PB N="10" REF="033718_0024_0FF8C44EA94F8408"/>adapted to the number and strength of the teeth; the teeth serve chiefly for chewing: digestion, and, of course, the nourishment, health, strength, and happiness of a man de∣pends, in a great degree, on the chew∣ing of the solid part of the food, which is mixed with the spittle, and converted into a sweet milk-like fluid, called chyle: it is, therefore, necessary that a heal∣thy man should have a sound set of teeth.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 29. Can one always and solely de∣pend upon these signs of health?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No. They are apt to deceive some∣times.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 30. What must be done, in order, unerringly, to ascertain whether an ap∣parently healthy man be so in reality?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> the temperament, health, and virtu∣ous or moral conduct of his parents, ought to be considered.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 21. What ought to be the state of health of the parents of a healthy person?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The father as well as the mother ought to be strong and healthy, not de∣formed, nor subject to such diseases as may descend to their children, such as the King's Evil, Madness, Consumption, Epi∣lepsy,
<PB N="11" REF="033718_0025_0FF9149037010E00"/><HI>&amp;c.</HI> They both ought to have a good constitution, and the prospect of attaining old age in good health, and should be of a virtuous disposition.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 32. Why is it necessary for them to be virtuous?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Because the virtue of the parents is discovered in the children, and because vir∣tuous parents encourage their children, by their example, to endeavour to become worthy and honourable members of soci∣ety.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 33. What then must be the disposition of those parents, who wish to bring up vir∣tuous and healthy children?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They must be virtuous and healthy themselves.</P>

<HEAD>III. Of the Construction, or Structure of the Human Body.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 34. HOW is the human body constructed?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> With infinite wisdom and goodness, and in the most perfect manner.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 35. What have we in particular to observe with respect to the perfect structure of the human body?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That it is endowed with the greatest and most salutary powers, tending to pre∣serve life and health, to remove diseases, or to heal wounds.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 36. If the body contain any thing unnatural, or if it has been wounded, or otherwise hurt, so as to cause its functions to be obstructed, how do those powers act?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They operate more or less powerfully to expel from the body all that is unnatu∣ral, or to heal it wounds.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">
<PB N="13" REF="033718_0027_0FF91494FB77F7F0"/>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>If a splinter sticks in any part of the body, irritated nature produces matter to ex∣pel it. If the stomach be loaded with bile, or putrid matter, nature strives to remove it by vomiting. If a person has broken one of his limbs, nature will soften the broken ends of the bone, in order that they may knit without plaster or salve: but the previous assist∣ance of an able surgeon is required to bring the broken ends of the bone in contact, and to secure them so, af∣ter which tranquillity and rest are ne∣cessary.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 37. Can the body, notwithstanding all those great powers with which God has en∣dowed man, sustain any injury;</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The healthy and vigorous man is very seldom subject to any.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 38. But as we, nevertheless, see so many objects of pity, what may be the real reason of their sufferings?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Weakness; or the want of pure vital faculties.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 39. Is this weakness natural?</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="033718_0028_0FF9149BA71EB988"/><HI>A.</HI> No. Naturally man is strong, full of vigour and health.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 40. How have so many contracted this weakness?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Generally through their own faults, or through ignorance.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 41. Is there not another particular reason why men are so weak?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes. Their weakness has been here∣ditary, and transmitted to them from gene∣ration to generation.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 42. What must men do, that they may be less exposed to sickness?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They must do every thing to recover their natural strength.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">

<HEAD>IV. On the Attending and Nursing of Infants.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 45. WHAT does the little help∣less infant stand most in need of?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The love and care of his mother.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="033718_0030_0FF914A5340C5740"/><HI>Q.</HI> 46. Can this love and care be shewn by other persons?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No. Nothing equals a mother's love.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 47. Why does a child stand so much in need of the love and care of his mo∣ther?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Because the attendance and nursing, the tender and affectionate treatment which a child stands in need of, can only be ex∣pected from a mother.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 48. How ought infants to be attend∣ed and nursed?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They ought always to breathe fresh and pure air; be kept dry and clean, and plunged in cold water every day.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 49. Why so?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Because children are thus, at the time alluded to, made more placid, because not irritated; and they grow and thrive better.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 50. Is it good to swathe a child?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No. Swathing is a very bad custom, and produces in children great anxiety and pains; it is injurious to the growth of the body, and prevents children from being kept clean and dry.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 51. Is the rocking of children proper?</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="033718_0031_0FF8C45E487F7210"/><HI>A.</HI> No. It makes them uneasy, giddy, and stupid: and is therefore as hurtful to the soul as to the body.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 52. Do children rest and sleep with∣out being rocked?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes. If they be kept continually dry and clean, and in fresh air, they will rest and sleep well, if not disturbed; the rock∣ing and carrying about of children is quite useless.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>As the human soul in a state of infancy is disturbed by rocking, carrying about and dancing, such practices ought to be considered as dangerous and erro∣neous.</P>
<P>The mother ought to play with the child in an affectionate and gentle manner; ought to give it frequent and mild ex∣ercise, and instil gradually into its mind a knowledge of such objects as attract its notice.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 53. Is it in general necessary to keep children quiet?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes it is.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="033718_0032_0FF914A6DE898CF8"/><HI>Q.</HI> 54. What is therefore very bad?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The making a great noise about children; and it is still worse to frighten them.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 55. It is, therefore, not advisable, I suppose, to frighten children into sleep?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By no means; because they may be thrown into convulsions by it.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 56. Is it necessary or good to give children composing draughts, or other me∣dicines that tend to promote sleep?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No. They cause an unnatural, and, of course, unwholesome, sleep; and are very hurtful and dangerous.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 57. How long must a mother suckle her child?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> From nine to twelve months.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>In fact the child ought to be suckled till it has two teeth in each jaw. Some children are suckled for two or three years; a practice not only errone∣ous, but hurtful both to mother and child.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="033718_0033_0FF914AFF1827428"/><HI>Q.</HI> 58. What sort of aliment is prejudi∣cial to the health of children?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Meal-pap, pancakes, and tough, heavy, and fat meats.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 59. What harm do they do?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They obstruct the bowels; and chil∣dren's bellies get, by those indigestible meals, hard and swelled.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 60. What food is most suitable for children?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Pure, unadulterated, new milk, and gruel; bread or biscuit boiled with water only, or mixed with milk.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 61. Is it proper to chew the food be∣fore you give it to children?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No. It is disgusting and hurtful.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 62. What is in general to be observed with regard to the feeding of children?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That they be regularly and moderate∣ly fed, and their stomachs not loaded with milk or other things. It is, therefore, ne∣cessary to prevent people from giving chil∣dren sweetmeats, or food out of season; the feeding of the child ought to be entire∣ly left to its mother.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 63. Do affectionate careful mothers
<PB N="20" REF="033718_0034_0FF8C45FD58B26E8"/>act right when they take their infants with them to bed ?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No. It is hurtful and dangerous; children ought, therefore, to lie by them∣selves.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>In Italy, mothers who take their suck∣lings to bed with them use a machine, which protects them from all injury and danger. It is called <HI>Arcuccio,</HI> and is 3 feet 2 inches long; and the head∣board 14 inches broad, and 13 inches high; and the sides 8 inches high.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 64. Is it necessary to keep infants very warm?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No. They must not be kept too warm.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 65. Is it good to cover their heads?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By no means; it causes humours to break out.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>From the hour of birth the head of a child ought to be kept uncovered. Mothers

<P><HI>Q.</HI> 66. Children are eager to stare at every thing, particularly at the light; what is to be observed with regard to this?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They ought to be immediately turn∣ed so as to have the object in a direct line be∣fore them; they should never be suffered to look at it side-ways, as that would cause them to squint.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 67. By what means is the getting of teeth rendered difficult and dangerous?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By caps; by keeping the head too warm; by uncleanliness, and improper food, over-feeding, bad air, and want of exercise.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>Nature herself causes pains at teething time, and the child is afterwards the cause of many more. It may not be amiss here to observe, 1. That pains and sufferings are the first instructors of man; they teach him to avoid ills, and make him provident, compassionate,
<PB N="22" REF="033718_0036_0FF914B7817BB320"/>humane, and courageous. 2. Na∣tural bodily pain, in many instances, and particularly in childhood, is less hurtful to man and his happiness, than the anxiety and mortification of soul which a child suffers that is irritated, put in a passion, or treated with con∣tempt; and it is as bad to frighten children.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 68. What is to be observed with re∣gard to making children walk?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They ought not to be taught to walk in strings, or chairs, or go-carts, or be led by the arm; they ought to be suffered to creep on the floor, till by degrees they learn to walk.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 69. How can we best assist children in speaking.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We ought to pronounce the words to them very distinctly and slowly; first sin∣gle sounds, and then easy words.</P>
</DIV3>

<P>It is of the greatest importance that man,

<P><HI>Q.</HI> 70. What are the principal reasons why one fourth of the number of children that come into the world, die in the course of the first two years?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Want of fresh pure air, uncleanliness, bad indigestible food, particularly meal-pap, the anxiety and misery of parents are also among the causes of the death of so many children.</P>

<HEAD>V. Of the Treatment of Children with res∣pect to their Bodies, from the Third to the Ninth or Twelfth Year.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the third to the seventh year, the child has 20 milk-teeth, and during that time the body is weak; these are changed from that period to the twelfth year for strong teeth. In the ninth year the child has 10 milk,
<PB N="24" REF="033718_0038_0FF914C1838229B0"/>and 12 perfect teeth. In the twelfth year both sexes have 24 strong and per∣fect teeth, and not until then the body begins to receive its natural real strength.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 71. If man is to grow up healthy and strong, how must he be educated?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He ought to receive a liberal, judi∣cious, and prudent education in his infancy, as well as in his youth.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 72. Is this of so much importance?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; for upon that depends his health, strength, and the happiness of his succeeding days.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 73. What is understood by a judi∣cious education?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That man be educated agreeably to the nature of his soul and body.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 74. What is, therefore, necessary to be known that we may give a judicious edu∣cation to children?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The nature of man and of his exist∣ence.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 75. What changes does man under∣go during the first nine or twelve years of his existence?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> His body grows and acquires shape;
<PB N="25" REF="033718_0039_0FF914C4C19A5EB0"/>his soul learns the use of the body; his facul∣ties, with regard to conception and percep∣tion, improve; and he is joyful and happy in company with those of his own age.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 76. What does nature particularly at∣tempt to effect during infancy?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The formation of the body.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 77. Is the energy of the soul, and the accomplishment of man, promoted by the perfection of the body?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; the more perfect the body is the more perfect is the soul, and the more man is capable of promoting his own happiness, and that of his fellow creatures.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 78. Are the natural motions or ac∣tions of any use to the body?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; its perfection is thereby pro∣moted, and the whole body filled with life and vigour.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 79. Of what use are those sensations to the child which its soul conceives through the senses?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They are the foundation of its un∣derstanding; for the more the mind has seen, heard, and felt, and the more distinct its sensations are, the more sensible will man become </P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> They learn to know, to understand, and to love each other, and so lay a founda∣tion for unanimity, mutual fondness, and the happiness of their lives.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 81. But if children live in society merry and happy together, can that have any influence upon them when they arrive at a state of maturity?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; it contributes very much to make man spend his life, according to his destination, in virtue and happiness.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 82. By what means are those wise designs of Nature promoted?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By activity, and gentle, though con∣stant exercise both of the mind and body of children.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 83. Is such exercise compatible with the nature of children?</P>

<P>From the twelfth to the eighteenth year the supple body should be invigorated by exercise and plays; the intuitive mind, by instruction and reflection, may lay up a store of knowledge, and man, whose infancy was passed in joy and happiness, learn to become virtu∣ous in his youth; and he will become so if he has experienced the vicissitudes of fortune, her smiles and frowns, and shared his joys with others; if he firmly believes that all the descendants of Adam have an equal right to enjoy pleasures, and are equally obnoxious to pain; and that an allwise good God created every thing good; and man∣kind, with a view of making them happy.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>Children with scurfy heads ought to keep their heads cool, clean, and uncovered; their hair cut, or repeatedly combed; which will be sufficient to cure the evil, for to cure it with salves is a very danger∣ous custom.</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> No; those that are accustomed from their infancy to go uncovered, will not be affected by the sun.</P>

<P><PB N="32" REF="033718_0046_0FF914E132F97FE0"/><HI>A.</HI> It ought not to be combed back∣wards, or tied behind; but it ought to hang free round the head to protect it.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 99. Ought the hair to be often combed?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; it ought to be kept in order and combed repeatedly every day; which pre∣vents vermin from settling in it, and indu∣ces cheerfulness and liveliness.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 100. Is it right that the collars of shirts and neckcloths should press the neck and its veins?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; the neck ought not to be squeezed; and, therefore, children ought to have their necks bare.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 101. How ought childrens garments to be arranged?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> So as not to impede the free and easy motions of the body, or prevent the access of the fresh strengthening air to it; they, therefore, ought to be free, wide and open.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 102. What further is requisite for this dress?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It ought to be simple, clean, light, cool, cheap, and easy to put on or take off;
<PB N="33" REF="033718_0047_0FF914E551B50908"/>it ought to be different in every respect from that of older or grown-up persons.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 103. What other reason is there for making this distinction between the dress of children and grown-up persons?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> To induce children to live with less restraint and greater happiness in the soci∣ety of each other; to impress upon their minds an idea of their weak, helpless condition, in order thereby to check the too early ebullitions of that pride which leads children to ape the customs and acti∣ons of grown-up persons; a practice un∣becoming at their age, and dangerous to their health and morals.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 104. How, and of what materials ought childrens garments to be made?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> A child ought to wear a wide linen frock, white, with blue stripes, having wide short sleeves, and a shirt of the same form.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">

The collar of the shirt to fall back over that of the frock,—the only garment that a child should wear over his shirt, in order that it may move easily and without restraint; and that the fresh air, hav∣ing free access to its body, may strengthen it.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 105. Ought children to wear this dress in the winter time?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; with the addition of a woollen frock, to be worn between the shirt and the linen frock.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 106. How are the stockings of chil∣dren to be made?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They must be short, and not tied; it would, therefore, be advisable to let them only wear socks, to cover the feet in the shoes.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">

<P>Stockings, that cover the knees, may produce swellings in them; they

<P><HI>Q.</HI> 107. Will not children find them∣selves too cold if their ankles are left bare?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; cold, if they are accustomed to it, will not affect their ankles more than their arms. It will strengthen their limbs. In short, they will be kept sufficiently warm by the shirt and frock.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 108. What is the form of the human foot?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> At the toes it is broad, the heel small, and the inside of the foot is longer than the outside. See Fig. I.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 109. Why has it this form?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That man may walk and stand with ease and firmness, and move his body freely.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 110. How ought shoes, particularly those of children, to be formed?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They ought to have the same form as the feet: they, therefore, ought not to be made by one, but two lasts, as the shape of the feet may indicate.</P>

<P>Each foot may be laid upon a sheet of paper, and its true shape drawn with a pencil, after which model two separate lasts may be made.</P>
<P>From Plate II. it appears clearly how shoes ought to be shaped. The mid∣dle Fig. I. is the original shape of the sole of the left foot; the first, Fig. III. shows how the sole of the left shoe ought to be formed; and the last, Fig. II. shows clearly, that the shoes we usually wear, made on one last, do not at all fit.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 111. Ought the shoes of children to have heels?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; heels cause the back tendon to shrink and impede the free and easy motions of the body in walking and running.</P>

<P>When children are suffered to walk much, and are bare-footed, they ac∣quire an easy and steady pace. Little children ought not to wear shoes be∣fore the eighteenth month; if they do, the soles must be thin and soft, that they may learn to walk easily and well. Boots ought not to be worn by children.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 112. How ought, therefore, chil∣dren, male as well as female, to be dres∣sed from the beginning of the third to the end of the seventh or eighth year?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Their heads and necks must be free and bare, the body clothed with a wide shirt and frock, with short sleeves; the feet covered only with a pair of socks to be worn in the shoes; the shoes ought to be made without heels, and to fit well.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 113. What benefit will be derived from this kind of dress?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The body will become healthier, stronger, taller, and more beautiful; chil∣dren will learn the best and most graceful

<P>Stays and stiff jackets are inventions of the most pernicious nature; they dis∣figure the beautiful and upright shape of a woman, and, instead of rendering her straight, as was formerly supposed, they make her crook-backed; they in∣jure the breast and bowels; obstruct the breathing and digestion; hurt the breasts and nipples so much, that ma∣ny mothers are prevented by their use from suckling their children; many hence get cancers, and at last lose both

<P>It is, therefore, the duty of parents, and especially of mothers, to banish from their houses and families both stays and jackets. Those girdles or sashes which press or constrain the belly are equally injurious; and, in general, it would be a desirable thing, if the female dress were made to consist of a long, easy, and beautiful robe, and not of two parts, joining or meeting at the hips.</P>

<HEAD>VII. Of Air.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 119. WHAT ought to be the state of the air in which man liveth, and every moment breathes?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The air in which man liveth, and which he breathes, ought to be fresh, clear, and dry.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 120. Why ought it to be fresh, clear, and dry?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Because it tends to refresh us, and make us healthy, composed and serene; it
<PB N="42" REF="033718_0056_0FF8C473CED81C20"/>encourages man to work cheerfully, excites appetite, improves health, and induces balmy sleep; in short, man finds himself ex∣ceedingly happy while he breathes fresh air.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 121. Does he feel equally as comfort∣able when he breathes bad, foul, and damp air?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No: in bad corrupted air man be∣comes weak, unhealthy, and irritable, loath∣some and stupid; it often causes fevers and many dangerous maladies very difficult to cure.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 122. Is it very necessary that man should live in fresh air, in order to enjoy a perfect state of health?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> As necessary as eating and drinking; or as clean water is to fishes.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 123. Why is it so?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Because the air contains, as well as our food, vital principles, which cannot be dispensed with, or supplied by any thing except the air we breathe.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">

<P>Even plants in the best soil, and beasts receiving the most wholesome food, will
<PB N="43" REF="033718_0057_0FF91511245DBCF8"/>decay without good pure air. Man, in particular requires fresh air, that he may live and thrive, be healthy, sensi∣ble, serene, and happy.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 124. By what means is air corrupt∣ed?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The air is corrupted in houses and rooms that are not sufficiently ventilated: beside, if in the vicinity of the habitations of man there be morasses, or stagnant waters, they are sufficient to corrupt the air.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 125. By what other means is air ren∣dered noxious?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Vapours arising from damp, foul things; the breath and perspirations of many persons; the smoke from lamps, tallow candles, and snuffs: the steam from ironing linen; the exhalations that arise from comb∣ing wool, and from burning charcoal; all tend, in a greater or less degree, to corrupt or deprave the air, and render it capable of impeding the action of the lungs, or induc∣ing suffocation.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 126. What ought people to do that are much confined to rooms or cham∣bers?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They ought frequently to open their
<PB N="44" REF="033718_0058_0FF91515DE9938B0"/>doors and windows, in order to dissipate corrupted air, and admit the cooling, health∣ful breezes.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 127. What other method can be de∣vised to prevent the depravation of air in a room?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By making two holes, one through the outer wall of the house, that will open into the room near the floor of it; the other near the cieling, through the opposite in∣ner wall or partition; the external atmos∣phere will enter at the hole near the floor, and dissipate the foul air through the aper∣ture above.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What else ought people to do, to ob∣tain so desirable an end?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They ought to keep their rooms clean, and in proper order; nothing superfluous, or that can possibly corrupt the air, ought to be suffered in them.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 129. What are the signs by which you may know whether rooms be clean, and contain wholesome air?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> When there are no cobwebs in the corners, or on the cieling of the room, nor dust, nor straw, nor filth of any kind; when the windows are clean and clear, and no offensive smell, or unpleasant sensation,
<PB N="45" REF="033718_0059_0FF915186F516F10"/>is experienced by a person who enters it that has been just breathing the open air, we conclude that it is as it ought to be.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 130. Is it necessary for man to breathe fresh air when asleep?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes: it is necessary that he breathe good wholesome air, whether awake or a∣sleep: curtains encompassing a bed, and narrow bedsteads, are therefore very un∣wholesome.</P>

<P><HI>Q.</HI> 132. OF what use is cleanliness to man?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It preserves his health and virtue; it clears his understanding, and encourages him to activity; it procures him the esteem of others; and none but clean people can be really cheerful and happy.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 133. How far is uncleanliness injuri∣ous to man?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It corrupts his health and virtue; it stupifies his mind, and sinks it into a lethargic state; it deprives him of the esteem and love

<P><HI>Q.</HI> 134. Does uncleanliness cause any maladies?</P>

<P><PB N="48" REF="033718_0062_0FF91525C4593C48"/><HI>A.</HI> It is not sufficient to wash the face, hands, and feet; it is also necessary, at short intervals, to wash the skin all over the body, and to bathe frequently.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 137. Is washing and bathing the whole body wholesome?</P>

<P><HI>Q.</HI> 151. Of What ought our meals to consist?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Chiefly of vegetables.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>That man was not designed to live on meat, or on vegetables, only, is evident from the construction of his teeth stomach, and bowels. Living upon animal food only, causes putrefaction of the blood; and vegetables by them∣selves do not sufficiently nourish or strengthen the body.</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> No.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="address">
<HEAD>ADDRESS TO CHILDREN.</HEAD>
<P>Children, brandy is a bad liquor. A few hundred years ago brandy was not known among us. About 1000 years ago, the destructive art of distilling spirits of wine from wine was found out; and 300 years ago, brandy was first distilled from corn. In the be∣ginning it was considered as physic. It did not, however, come into gene∣ral use till the close of the last century, or rather till within the last thirty years, that it has become an universal beverage, to the great detriment of mankind.</P>
<P>Our forefathers in former times, who had no idea of brandy, were quite different people from what we are; they were much more healthy and strong. Brandy, whether drunk by itself, or at meals, cannot be con∣verted into blood, flesh, or bone;
<PB N="69" REF="033718_0083_0FF9157691164480"/>consequently, it cannot give health or strength, nor does it promote diges∣tion: it only makes one unhealthy, stupid, lazy, and weak. It is, there∣fore, a downright falsehood, that brandy, as a common beverage, is use∣ful, good, and necessary. Our fore∣fathers lived well without it. And as experience teaches us, that even the most moderate, and most reasonable, give way to the baneful custom of drinking every day more and more brandy, it is much better, in order to avoid temptation, to drink none at all; for, believe me, children, brandy de∣prives all who addict themselves to the immoderate and daily use of it—of health, reason, and virtue. It impels us to quit our house and home, to abandon our wives and children, and entails on its wretched votaries, mi∣sery and disease, which may descend to the third and fourth generation.</P>
<P>It has been observed in all countries, in England, Scotland, Sweden, North America, and Germany, that in pro∣portion to the quantity of brandy con∣sumed, were the evils which health,
<PB N="70" REF="033718_0084_0FF9157C154A7C38"/>strength, reason, virtue, industry, prospe∣rity, domestic and matrimonial felicity, the education of children, humanity, and the life of man had to encounter.</P>
<P>It was this that induced an Indian in North America, of the name of Lackawanna, to say, that the brandy which had been introduced amongst the Indians by the English, tended to corrupt mankind and destroy hu∣manity.
<Q>They have given us (said he) brandy! and who has given it to them (Europeans,) who else but an evil spirit.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 195. Tell me, therefore, dear chil∣dren, may children drink brandy?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No, by no means; children must not only abstain from brandy, but also from rum, gin, whisky, and all other spi∣rituous liquors.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="admonition">

<P>It is true, that children must not drink brandy, not even a single drop, for brandy deprives children of their health and reason, of their virtue and happiness. When, therefore, dear

<P><HI>Q.</HI> 201. WHAT advantage doth man derive from bodily exercise, activity, and labour?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Bodily exercise, particularly in the open air, creates hunger and thirst, helps the digestion of our food, and makes it nourishing; it purifies the blood, keeps the bowels healthy, and causes rest and sound sleep.</P>

<P><PB N="75" REF="033718_0089_0FF9159F9C677430"/><HI>A.</HI> No; a little rest before and after din∣ner is necessary, and promotes appetite and digestion, recruits the powers of the body, and fits it for future work.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 205. What kind of exercise is pro∣per for children?</P>

<P>A child ought to take a great deal of ex∣ercise of the gentlest kind.

<P><PB N="76" REF="033718_0090_0FF915A1653CE1F8"/><HI>A.</HI> By being left during his childhood to exercise, unrestrained, with other chil∣dren, and by being carefully encouraged to activity, assiduity, industry, and think∣ing; by being taught to do such work as is proportioned to the strength of his body, and accustomed to do every thing with due consideration and in time, and not to post∣pone till to-morrow, what should be done to-day.</P>

<P><HI>Q.</HI> 207. What advantages arise from ac∣customing children to moderate or easy work?</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; when we have not had much exercise in the open air, and consequently are not tired, and when we, during our sleep, breathe corrupted air, or lie in warm feather-beds, we find ourselves after some time lazy, stupid, and unhealthy.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 217. Ought we to sleep in cool, fresh, and clean air?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes. And it therefore behoves us nor to sleep in warm fitting rooms, but in cool, lofty roomy chambers, that have fresh air; whose windows are kept open in the day time; and in beds without curtains, or with curtains not to be drawn.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 218. Is it wholesome to lie on, or un∣der feather-beds?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No. Is it very unwholesome. Fea∣ther-beds by their warmth, by the noxious, impure, putrid exhalations, which they at∣tract, render the body weak and unhealthy; and besides, are the cause of catarrhs, head, tooth, and ear aches—of rheumatism, and of many other maladies.</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> Matrasses stuffed with horse hair, or straw, covered with a blanket or quilt.— But when people sleep in feather-beds, they ought to air and beat them well in summer time once a week, and in winter once in a fortnight, and often change their bed-linen.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 220. What sort of bedding is proper for children?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Matrasses stuffed with straw, or moss well dried, which requires often to be changed.</P>

<P><HI>Q.</HI> 222. What is farther to be observed with respect to sleep?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We ought not to lie down till we are tired, nor remain in bed after we wake in the morning.</P>

<P><PB N="82" REF="033718_0096_0FF915AFCF04C9A0"/><HI>A.</HI> No; nor ought we to lie on our backs, but alternately on either side, in a somewhat bended position, taking care not to fold our arms round our heads.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 224. Is it proper for children to sleep in the same bed with grown-up persons, or ought several children to lie together?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No. Such practices are very hurtful; for the breath and exhalations consist of noxious vapours; it is therefore advisable for every child and every grown person to lie alone, in order to enjoy sound sleep.</P>

<PB N="90" REF="033718_0104_0FF915C1C28E2CC0"/>thunder and lightning, in order to prevent those fears and false impressions which are made upon the human mind when children are suffered to form erroneous notions of them.</P>
<P>Herds or flocks in thunder-storms ought not to be driven, hunted, or over-heated, or suffered to stand still, or assemble close together; they ought to be separated, and divided into small numbers; and people should take care not to come too near to them.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 244. May one shelter himself in a thunder storm under a tree?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; it is very dangerous. Trees and vapours which encompass them, attract the lightning, and persons standing under them are in the utmost danger of their lives.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 245. You are right, children, in ob∣serving that when thunder and lightning prevail one should not take shelter under trees; and the higher the tree, the greater is the danger; but, what precautions are people to take when at home during a thun∣der <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They are, when the storm is still at a distance, to open the doors and windows
<PB N="91" REF="033718_0105_0FF915C474D617B0"/>of their rooms, chambers, and stables, in order to expel all vapours, and fill them with fresh air. When it draws nearer, the windows are to be shut, and the doors left open, that fresh air may be admitted, avoid∣ing carefully a free stream of air. They are, further, to keep at a proper distance from walls, chimneys, and ovens, and from all iron and metal, in particular from long iron rods or wires; remaining, as to any thing else, composed and without fear.</P>

<HEAD>XIX. Of Over-heating Ourselves, and catching Cold.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 246. IF, thro' violent bodily exercise, labour, running, or dancing, we have over-heated ourselves, what ought we not to do?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We ought not immediately to sit down or rest ourselves.</P>

<PB N="92" REF="033718_0106_0FF915C99A0F6EB8"/>exercise any thing cold, or even brandy or other spirituous liquor, is highly impro∣per.</P>
<P N="3">3. We ought not to expose our bare skin to the cold air.</P>
<P N="4">4. We ought not to go into the cold bath: when thoroughly wet from rain, it is proper to walk about.</P>
<P N="5">5. We ought not to sit down on the ground, or on the grass; and we should be particularly careful not to fall asleep, other∣wise sickness, lameness, or perhaps con∣sumption, will be the fatal consequences.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>When people go home from their labour in the field, particularly in the evening, in cool, damp air, they ought always first to put on their clothes, and not return in their shirts.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 247. What else are we to attend to?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Those that are over-heated, are by very slow degrees to suffer themselves to cool, and enjoy rest; and dry and clean shirts and clothes are to be substituted for
<PB N="93" REF="033718_0107_0FF915CC0DE61EE8"/>those that have been wet by sweat. When cool and composed we may gradually drink to satisfy thirst.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 248. If people during work are very thirsty, may they not refresh themselves with some cold drink?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes, they may; but they must not drink too much at once, nor leave off working and rest themselves, but continue their labour, else they will take cold and fall sick.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 249. What are those to do who have caught cold from cold and damp wind and weather?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They are to drink a few cups of boiled water mixed with a fourth part of vinegar, put on warm clothes, and, by exercise, force the blood back to the skin. When the cold is violent they are to bathe their feet in warm water, drink vinegar and water and go to bed.</P>

<P>It is very unwholesome to drink spiritu∣ous liquors, or heating medicines to induce sweat.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 250. What are we to do if our feet or bodies be wet and cold?</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="033718_0108_0FF915CEAB49C980"/><HI>A.</HI> We are to take off the wet stockings or clothes, left they should cause a catarrh, I the palsy or rheumatism.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 251. But what else ought to be done?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> As soon as a person under such cir∣cumstances returns home, he ought not only to take off the wet clothes, but wash and dry his skin well, and put on warm clothes.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 252. How do people by slow degrees get catarrhs, palsy, rheumatism, and other maladies?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By the obstruction of the perspiration of the whole, or a part, of the body, oc∣casioned by want of exercise, by wet or damp rooms or beds, wet clothes, and ex∣posure to cold air.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 253. Tell me how a person may catch cold?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> When a person, for instance, leans with his arm against a damp wall, or, what is still worse, falls asleep in that position, or that the part is exposed to a stream of air, that part will be attacked by rheuma∣tism or palsy, or catarrh will be produced.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 254. How may catarrhs and rheuma∣tism, be prevented?</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="033718_0109_0FF915D14B8756F8"/><HI>A.</HI> They may be prevented by keeping the skin constantly cold, clean, and strong; by exposing it to pure air; by washing and bathing when the body is not kept too warm by unnecessary clothes, and by much exer∣cise in the open air.</P>

<HEAD>XX. Of the Preservation of certain Parts of the Human Body.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 255. WHICH are the parts of the human body that man should take par∣ticular care to preserve in a good state of health?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The organs of his five senses?</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 256. By what means are the organs of sight, hearing, and smelling, preserved healthy, improved, and strengthened?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By free, pure air, and very frequent exercise in open air, rather than in confined places.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 257. What is in general very hurt∣ful to those three senses?</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="033718_0110_0FF915D443A58860"/><HI>A.</HI> The unnecessary care of keeping the head warm by caps or other coverings.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>The baneful consequences which arise from covering the head, or keeping it too warm, are ulcers, scabs, boils, and lice, which lay the foundation of evils to the human race, greater than can be calculated.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 258. How may the eyes be injured?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By dazzling, irregular, and transient lights; by objects brought too near the sight, or viewed sideways; by corrupted air, dust, smoke, damp vapours, the fat, sharp fumes of oil or candles; by the heat of ovens, and reading without sufficient light.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 259. What hurts the hearing?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Strong, sharp, unexpected sounds or reports, corrupted air, feather beds, dust, too much snot in the nose, and pressure on the external ear, forcing it too near to the head.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">
<PB N="97" REF="033718_0111_0FF915D9347A6AF0"/>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION</HEAD>
<P>That the sense of hearing may be quick and distinct, the external ear should project sufficiently from the head, and be moveable; but this is prevented by the close caps, which young children wear.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 260. How are the organs of smell injured?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By corrupted air; by strong and foul odours; by snot in the nose, or snuff ob∣structing the nostrils, and obliging us to breathe through the mouth.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 261. By what means is the organ of taste preserved?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By exercise; by the use of water, and mild plain food.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 262. How may the organ of feeling be preserved?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By the exercise of the faculty of feel∣ing—by the exercise of the body, and by cleanliness.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 263. Are the common exercises of the senses sufficient to render them perfect?</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="033718_0112_0FF9159ADB9DDAD0"/><HI>A.</HI> No. The senses require to be inces∣santly exercised that they may become per∣fect, and capable of directing and uphold∣ing us amidst the wanderings of a disorder∣ed imagination, whole phantoms vanish be∣fore the torch of reason.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>Our sight and hearing, if not sufficiently improved, may deceive us during the night, or when the mental faculties are impaired by fear or prejudice: hence the origin of the absurd belief in spectres. But if our senses be ren∣dered, perfect; if we approach, and courageously endeavour to touch what∣ever imagination conjures up to our view, and if we explore whatever place a noise issues from, we shall soon be delivered from our delusion, and from the belief in the existence of spectres, witches, and all such absur∣dities. Those who tell stories of spec∣tres to children, with a view to fright∣en them, are highly reprehensible; and should be excluded from all share in the education of youth.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="033718_0113_0FF915DE129A7F38"/><HI>Q.</HI> 265. How can a good, intelligible pronunciation be obtained?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By keeping the mouth and the nose clean, the neck free and uncovered, and obliging children to accustom themselves to speak slowly, distinctly, and emphatically, and to keep themselves erect.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 266. Should we breathe through the mouth or the nose?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We should breathe through the nose, but not through the mouth; it is therefore necessary to keep the nose always clean by blowing it, and to endeavour to breathe through the nose and keep the mouth shut during sleep.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 267. Are there no other parts of the body which man should take particular care in preserving?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; his teeth; for the teeth are not only necessary to assist us to pronounce distinctly, but for chewing also; and on the proper chewing of our food depends, in a great measure, digestion, and the nourishment, health, and prosperity of mankind.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 268. How are the teeth injured?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By much fluid aliment; by coffee,
<PB N="100" REF="033718_0114_0FF915E343AACFF0"/>tea, and other warm slops used instead of cold water; by corrupted air in apart∣ments; by uncleanliness; by the use of tobacco; by bits of food, particularly meat, sticking between them; by hot meats and liquors; by filling the mouth alternately with hot and cold things; by biting hard substances, and picking our teeth with knives, forks, pins, and needles; all which practices are highly injurious to them.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>Nobody should put pins or needles in their mouth; they may easily be swal∣lowed and cause death. In general it would be well to make as little use of pins, even in dressing, as possible.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 269. By what means are the teeth preserved sound?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By the early habit of properly chew∣ing our food; by drinking cold water: by breathing pure air, and eating cold or tepid aliment, and drinking no warm liquors at all: by cleaning the teeth after each meal, either by drinking or gargling the mouth; and by refraining from picking of them;
<PB N="101" REF="033718_0115_0FF915E81E53BF88"/>all this is necessary to keep the teeth sound and beautiful.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 270. By what means are the front teeth preserved sound?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By constant use, and the chewing particularly of dry substances, as bread, &amp;c.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>Children are not to cut with a knife the bread that has been handed to them, but to break it with the teeth and chew it.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 271. Should children also preserve their milk-teeth.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By all means; for the lasting teeth, which are hid by them, are injured if the milk-teeth are not kept sound by much chewing.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 272. If the teeth be not kept sound from childhood, and are injured, can they be restored to their original state?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No, that cannot be done; but through cleanliness, chewing, pure air, and cold water, injured teeth may he preserved from further injury.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="033718_0116_0FF915EDAEAE2A30"/><HI>Q.</HI> 273. What are the best remedies to prevent tooth-ache?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Chewing, drinking of and gargling with cold water; pure air, cleanliness of the mouth, keeping the head cool, bathing the face, after rising in the morning, and before going to bed, in cold water.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 274. Does the preservation of the spittle deserve our particular notice?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Very much. The spittle is very neces∣sary in chewing and digestion, and for that reason the smoking and chewing of tobacco, by which a great deal of the spittle is wast∣ed, is a very bad custom, as is also the wet∣ting with spittle the thread when spinning flax or hemp.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>The thread may be wetted with wa∣ter rendered clammy by beer, soap, ground lintseed, bran, thin dough, starch, kernels of quinces, bird-lime, or others things. And besides, the flax or hemp should be well beat before it is put on the distaff, and well
<PB N="103" REF="033718_0117_0FF915F0114C96C0"/>dusted, else, in spinning, the dust or woody particles will be drawn by the breath into the lungs, and occasion coughing, stuffing, and perhaps a con∣sumption.</P>

<HEAD>XXI. Of the Beauty and Perfection of the Human Body.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 275. WHAT is the basis of beauty?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Health, and the perfect conforma∣tion of the body.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>"Health," says Bertuch (see Journal of Luxes and Fashion,) March 1793, page, 139,
<Q>is the only and infalli∣ble source of beauty; all other modes of attaining it, such as folly, imposture, and ignorance have de∣vised, may be compared to a plaster, which soon falls off, leaving mourn∣ful traces of disease behind. The
<PB N="104" REF="033718_0118_0FF915F5B00486B8"/>beautiful bloom of youth, the fresh colour, the perfection of the whole bodily structure, the free and easy play of the muscles, the fulness of the veins, the clear, delicately-spread, trasparent skin. the glance of the eye so expressive of life and of the condition of the soul, great cheer∣fulness; all announce and expressi∣ble sensation of contentment and delight; which dispenses health and happiness both of soul and body, makes the husband, the wife, the youth, the virgin, and the infant happy, and bestows on every mem∣ber of society charms and attractive powers which no art in the world can afford.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 276. By what particular means may health be attained?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By free and easy exercise of the body during infancy.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 277. What is besides requisite and necessary?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Free, pure air; washing and bathing;
<PB N="105" REF="033718_0119_0FF915FCFAA65010"/>a light easy dress; clear cold water for drink∣ing; and simple good meals to nourish the body.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 278. By what means is the perfection of the body to be attained?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By avoiding sloth and inactivity till the twelfth year, after which plays and ex∣ercises will bring the body to every decree of perfection of which it is susceptible.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 279. What is yet necessary to facili∣tate the improvement of the body?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The instruction of children in the va∣rious exercises of the body, which tend to render man healthy, strong, industrious, and happy.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 280. What posture of the body ought we to recommend to children and to every one?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The erect posture, whether we stand or walk, keeping the breast and head ele∣vated; and on all occasions that will admit of it, an upright posture is best.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 281. What, therefore, may be con∣sidered as very hurtful?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Walking, standing, or sitting negli∣gently, remaining bent or crooked, hang∣ing down the head while we speak or listen, and looking askance.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="033718_0120_0FF91601BB5E2690"/><HI>Q.</HI> 282. Is it proper to accustom children to make use on all occasions of the right hand only?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; that is very wrong. Children are to be taught to make the same use of the left hand as of the right.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 283. What does most diminish beauty?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The habit which children sometimes contract of making wry faces and foolish gestures.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 284. Is the beauty of man all that depends on his perfection?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No. Innocence and peace, reason and virtue, the consciousness of having done one's duty, and contributed towards the general good, in endeavouring to diffuse happiness among mankind in this terrestrial abode, all shew the perfection, the beauty and dignity of man.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>IF people lived as they ought to do, they would be exposed to very few in∣ternal complaints, perhaps none at all; and the little ailments to which Nature, under all circumstances is obnoxious, would be removed by;
<PB N="108" REF="033718_0122_0FF91606C0480580"/>those powers with which God has en∣dowed her, for the preservation of the life and health of the human body, con∣structed with infinite wisdom and intel∣ligence. But people, seduced by their passions and misguided by error, lead an irregular and dissolute life, and thus expose themselves to a train of melan∣choly diseases.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 285. Tell me then, what ought those to do that are taken ill?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They ought to keep themselves tran∣quil and composed, and apply for the assist∣ance of a physician.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 286. What knowledge should a phy∣sician have who undertakes the cure of diseases?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He should have a thorough knowledge of the beautiful and complicated structure of the human body; know the various causes of diseases, their nature and their mode of action on the human body; how the heal∣ing power of nature operates; and how medicines, whose virtues he ought to be acquainted with, contribute to remove or cure diseases.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 287. Is the knowledge necessary for
<PB N="109" REF="033718_0123_0FF916097551C3D8"/>a physician easily attained by reading a few books, or by conversation?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No. It is a very difficult matter to attain a thorough knowledge of the science of physic, which those who practice it should begin to study in their youth, and cultivate continually through life with great assiduity and pains.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 288. To whom should a patient ap∣ply for assistance?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Not to a quack, but to a physician of understanding, knowledge, and recti∣tude of heart; who has received a regular education, and studied methodically the very difficult art of knowing and curing diseases.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 289. What class of people do you call quacks?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> All those who are not acquainted with the structure of the human body, and who have not methodically studied the science of curing diseases; all those who presume to judge of the nature of a disease by the urine only; who arrogantly promise to cure every malady; and all those are also classed among quacks who are not proper∣ly authorized to act in the capacity of phy∣sicians.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="033718_0124_0FF9160ECFEE1830"/><HI>Q.</HI> 290. Is it possible to learn the nature of a disease from the urine?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No. The urine by itself cannot deter∣mine the nature of a malady. Those, there∣fore, that set up as <HI>water-doctors,</HI> are gene∣rally impostors; by whom many lose not only their money, but their health and lives.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 291. Can maladies originate in su∣pernatural causes, such as witchcraft or sor∣cery?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; it were nonsensical and foolish to believe it. Nature operates universally; and all diseases spring from natural causes.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 292. What opinion may we form of travelling, advertising operators, that pre∣tend to cure ruptures by cutting; and what are we to think of itinerant dentists and o∣culists?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They are mostly impostors, who have no other view than to defraud the credulous of their money.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 293. Is it reasonable to buy medicines for man or beast of those medicine-hawkers who travel about the country?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; for by the stuff which those va∣gabonds sell, life and health may be lost;
<PB N="111" REF="033718_0125_0FF9161173E95268"/>their nostrums should not be given to any even of the brute creation.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 294. Is it adviseable to take domestic remedies, or family receipts?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No. In a hundred such, there is hardly one that answers the purpose. The best, the only, and universal domestic re∣medies which the Almighty has given us are—fresh air and cold water.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 295. What are we to observe respec∣ting those universal, or secret medicines, for the cure, for instance, of canine madness, the ague, &amp;c?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Nothing favourable; they expose health and life to the utmost danger.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>The secret remedies against the canine madness, and those which are usually resorted to as infallible, are good for nothing. The only certain means of preventing the fatal effects consequent on the bite of a mad-dog (producing canine madness, shewn, by a strong abhorrence from water), are cutting out the bitten part, or burning it with
<PB N="112" REF="033718_0126_0FF8C4BD73D07B08"/>a hot iron, or washing the wound as soon as possible, and very often with water, or washing it with soap lye, which destroys the surface of it; or, filling it and covering the edges of it with Spanish-flies, which, by inducing copious suppuration, draw all the poi∣son from the part affected.</P>
<P><HI>Universal medicines</HI> (so called) are vainly offered for the cure of many, nay, even of all diseases; but, in truth, there are no such medicines. The me∣dicines so much recommended in news∣papers, and the majority of English pa∣tent medicines, are good for nothing.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 296. When people have received hurts, to whom are they to apply for assist∣ance?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> To a surgeon.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 297. Is it very easy to attain a proper knowledge of surgery?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No. To become a good surgeon, much study and labour are necessary.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 298. Where ought those medicines to be bought that are prescribed by a physi∣cian or surgeon?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> In the shops of apothecaries who are
<PB N="113" REF="033718_0127_0FF916195A053970"/>authorised to sell medicines, and who are noted for order and cleanliness, as well as for the ability with which they conduct busi∣ness.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 299. Is the art of an apothecary easily leanrt?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; it is very difficult; many years are required to become acquainted with all the medicines, to know their properties, and how to prepare them judiciously.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 300. At what period of a disease is it most proper to apply to a physician?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Immediately on the first attack.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 301. What knowledge and informa∣tion doth a physician require that he may be able to cure a disease.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> He must know the nature and the cause of the disease; it is therefore indis∣pensably necessary to acquaint him with all the circumstances and symptoms of the disease, and to lay before him the whole state of the patient from the beginning of it, with the greatest exactness; he must know the constitution, and the manner of living, of the patient, and likewise every circum∣stance which might have operated in produc∣iug the disease.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 302. What is therefore proper?</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="033718_0128_0FF9161ED034F0E8"/><HI>A.</HI> That the physician see and speak to the patient himself, and investigate the nature and cause of the disease?</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 303. Suppose certain circumstances prevent this, what must then be done?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> An exact and circumstantial statement of the case of the patient must be drawn by some intelligent person and sent to the doctor.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>In order to do this properly, every house∣keeper, or, at least, every parish, in the country, in or near which there is no physician, ought to be in possession of certain rules, according to which, such a statement may be drawn proper∣ly. I therefore apprize the public, that a book, much read in Germany, con∣taining such rules, and much other useful matter, is now translating, and will soon be published.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 304. What is required of a patient under the care of a physician?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That he take the medicines which
<PB N="115" REF="033718_0129_0FF916240B351078"/>the physician has prescribed, faithfully, re∣gularly, in due time, and in the dose pre∣scribed.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 305. Is it to be expected that a seri∣ous indisposition should be cured by one prescription?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No. As well may we expect a large tree to be cut down by one stroke of an axe, as a disease of any consequence to be cured by the first prescribed physic.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 306. If, then, the first prescribed medicine does not give relief, must the pa∣tient persevere in the use of it, or employ another doctor?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The patient must continue to take medicine till the disease be cured; but he must not go from one doctor to another.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 307. Is it sufficient that the patient take the medicine prescribed, in order to obtain a cure?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; it is not sufficient: he must ob∣serve a proper diet, without which medi∣cines become of little use. Diseases are often cured by the healing powers of na∣ture, assisted only by proper regimen.</P>

<HEAD>XXIII. Of the Conduct to be observed by Patients afflicted with Fevers.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE diseases are denominated fe∣brile which manifest themselves by cold or hot sits, and an unnatural alteration in the pulse, commonly accompanied with dislike to food, vomiting, weak∣ness, anxiety, and pains all over the body, or in particular parts, and head∣ach.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 308. A rich person is a poor, helpless creature, oppressed by anxiety and pains;— how, then, ought he to be treated?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> With the greatest tenderness, kind∣ness, and affection; he ought to be attend∣ed and nursed with great and judicious care.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 309. Is it proper to talk much to per∣sons
<PB N="117" REF="033718_0131_0FF9162C8EA55038"/>suffering under grievous diseases, or to make great noise and confusion about them?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No. Sick people ought as little as possible to be disturbed by talking; and every thing about them ought to be quiet.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 310. Is it proper to admit visitors, or many persons, into the room where a sick person lies?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; because the air becomes cor∣rupted by the breath and exhalations from so many visitors, who generally come through curiosity, and therefore ought not to be admitted.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 311. What ought to be the state of the air in the rooms or chambers of the sick?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> All sick persons, particularly those that labour under fever, ought to breathe fresh, pure, and dry air.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 312. Is fresh air so necessary for them?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes. It is indispensably necessary for them, for it is most effectual in cooling and composing them, and diminishes anxiety.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 313. What is further necessary?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That the room where the sick person lies be aired by keeping the window open al∣most the whole day; that the windows and
<PB N="118" REF="033718_0132_0FF91631B8211848"/>doors be thrown open occasionally, and that all superfluous, especially all soft fur∣niture be removed from the chamber of one ill of a fever.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 314. What kind of room is best a∣dapted for a sick person?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> A dry, lofty and large room; not a low, narrow, damp, and musty room: it must be kept clean and orderly, all dust and nastiness removed, and nothing suffered in it that can corrupt or infect the air.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 315. Should the room of a sick per∣son be lightsome or dark?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It should not be very lightsome, but rather darkish, as the light disturbs the re∣pose of the patient.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 316. What kind of bed doth a sick person require?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> An orderly and clean bed, not too warm, with covering not too heavy, bed not too soft, and clean linen. If straw be used instead of mattrasses, it must be fresh and dry, and free from all offensive smell.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 317. Is it good or bad for persons ill of fevers to lie on feather beds?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is hurtful; for such beds make the
<PB N="119" REF="033718_0133_0FF916338741A2B0"/>fever worse. They should lie on matrasses stuffed with horse hair, or on straw, covered with a light quilt.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 318. May two sick persons, or one sick person and a person in good health, lie together in one bed?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; every sick person ought to have a bed to himself, and, if particular circum∣stances do not intervene, a room also—with respect to healthy persons, they ought not to sleep in the bed, or in the room, of one that is sick.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 319. May the curtains of the bed be drawn in which a sick person lies?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; because it deprives him of the fresh air.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 320. Ought not the bed of a sick person to be shaken and made daily?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; a sick person ought to be taken every day out of bed, when he can bear it, that the bed may be made.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 321. How ought a sick person to be dressed?</P>
<P><HI>A</HI> His dress ought to be clean and com∣fortable.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 322. Ought not the sheets of the bed,
<PB N="120" REF="033718_0134_0FF8C4C696CFBCA8"/>and the shirt or shift of the sick person to be changed?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; they ought to be often changed —but the clean linen substituted ought to be well aired?</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 323. How ought the bed of a sick person to be placed?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Not near a cold, damp wall, but in an open, free situation, that the person may be approached and assisted on either side without inconvenience.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 324. Is it proper to keep the heads of persons ill of fevers, who are commonly very much affected with head-achs, warm.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; their heads are to be kept cool and uncovered, that the head-ach and deli∣rium may not increase.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 325. What are sick persons to drink, particularly those who are afflicted with fe∣vers, which induce thirst?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Cold, pure water, which in fevers ought to be mixed with vinegar or lemon-juice. A piece of toasted bread may also, be added, being a good ingredient.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 326. Is it good to warm or boil the water?</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="033718_0135_0FF9163A2030EFB0"/><HI>A.</HI> No; it should neither be warmed nor boiled.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 327. Is it proper for sick, persons to drink much tea?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; it is commonly hurtful to them.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>The drinking of much warm tea is also very hurtful to women in childbed; cold tea is preferable.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 328. Do persons ill of fever like to drink cold water?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; cold water and fresh air are the best strengtheners for such persons; they refresh, and diminish the anxiety and pains.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 329. Must a person in a fever drink much water?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; he ought to drink a great deal.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 330. Doth cold water chill a person afflicted with fever?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; a person after drinking cold water falls often into a gentle perspiration; and warm liquids frequently produce heat without any perspiration.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">
<PB N="122" REF="033718_0136_0FF9163BC653E368"/>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>In fluxes, and a few other diseases, warm drinks may perhaps answer better than cold.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 331. What regimen ought sick per∣sons to observe?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Persons afflicted with violent fever, or who labour under any other dangerous ma∣lady, lose all appetite, and therefore are not to be pressed to eat.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 332. Why should not persons in fever be pressed to eat?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Because they do not digest; and food remaining undigested in the stomach, ag∣gravates all diseases, particularly fevers.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 333. Is it proper to permit a person afflicted with the first attack of fever to eat, if he has an appetite?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; it is better for him to fast; for the eating of any thing readily increases the disease; fasting diminishes it; and there is no danger of starving.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 334. What kind of nourishment is
<PB N="123" REF="033718_0137_0FF9164207721CD8"/>best in fever, should the sick person be de∣sirous of any?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Butter-milk, sour milk, fresh, ripe, juicy fruits, strawberries, gooseberries, raspberries, cherries, plums, grapes, ap∣ples, pears, baked or dried fruit, barley wa∣ter, or water-gruel mixed with vinegar or lemon-juice; and, in short, whatever can cool and refresh the patient.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 335. What kinds of food are persons afflicted with fever to avoid?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Animal food, whether flesh, fish or fowl, broths, butter, eggs, pastry, or bread not well fermented or baked, are not to be allowed to such persons.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 336. When does their appetite re∣turn?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Not till the fever is cured, and rest and sleep restored.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 337. Should persons labouring under fever be kept warm or cool?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Such patients ought to be kept cool, avoiding all heat; and for that reason fires must not be made in the room where the patient lies, for his situation requires him to be kept more cool than warm.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 338. Is it good to sprinkle perfumes on the patient, or in his room?</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="033718_0138_0FF91647CBE15DD8"/><HI>A.</HI> Fresh air is better than all incense; but in malignant diseases it is very proper to correct the air by sprinkling hot vinegar in the room repeatedly during the day.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>John Howard, that friend to mankind, who, in visiting and exploring prisons, hospitals, and lazarettos, sacrificed his life for the benefit of the human race, said,
<Q>The use of perfumes or incense is a clear demonstration of the want of cleanliness and fresh air.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 339. Is it good in fevers to take any medicines to promote perspiration?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; in most cases it is dangerous; many fevers become by such means mortal. Such remedies or liquors as induce perspira∣tion should therefore not be taken without the advice of a physician.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 340. May a person ill of a fever be bled?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is in many fevers dangerous to bleed; and without the approbation of a physician no bleeding should take place in fevers.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="033718_0139_0FF9164D19BB5378"/><HI>Q.</HI> 341. But is it advisable for people in good health to accustom themselves to be bled annually once or twice?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No. People that are in good health should never be bled; for by bleeding with∣out necessity the blood is depraved, the body weakened, and health impaired.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>Bleeding pregnant women once or twice during their pregnancy is a very bad custom, hurtful both to mother and child.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 342. Are vomits prescribed by a phy∣sician dangerous?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Vomits prescribed by a physician are not dangerous; they often do not weaken so much as purges.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>As many maladies, and particularly many fevers, originate in, or are connected with, a foulness of the stomach, vomits
<PB N="126" REF="033718_0140_0FF9164FB1508AD0"/>are often of very great service, as they expel all foulness from the stomach.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 343. Should those who are ill of fe∣ver be permitted to remain long costive?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No. In fevers costiveness is very dan∣gerous.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>For persons whose general health is good, and who are slightly indisposed, stewed, fresh, or dried fruit, particularly plums, are a good remedy against cos∣tiveness.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 344. If a person be sick, and at the same time costive, by what means ought he to be relieved?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By a clyster.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Called in Scotland an injection.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 345. Are clysters dangerous, or doubtful remedies?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; they are not.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 346. What are we to observe with regard to the habit which some people have acquired of taking purges annually, at cer∣tain periods?</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="033718_0141_0FF9165478CCC968"/><HI>A.</HI> It is a very bad custom; and medi∣cines sold by pedlars and such vagabonds are commonly very pernicious.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 347. Ought children in good health to be purged often?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; it tends to nothing good; and in general the health of children should be preserved by proper attention to diet and cleanliness, and by much exercise in the open air, for it cannot be done by medi∣cines.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 348. Is it good to make use of plas∣ters and salves in cases of wounds, contu∣sions, or ulcers?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; plasters and salves seldom do good; in most cases they do more harm than good.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>In cases of ulcers on the feet, or St. An∣thony's fire, in particular, plasters and salves are carefully to be avoided, as very bad, and productive often of ob∣stinate sores.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 349. What must be done with wounds
<PB N="128" REF="033718_0142_0FF9165614C43920"/>that are not very large and deep, where neither a great vein nor the bowels are hurt?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The wound must be bandaged with a dry linen cloth, without being previously washed or cleansed with brandy or water; for the blood, which is better than all plas∣ters and salves, will often perfectly cure the wound without any suppuration.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 350. What is best to be done in cases of contusion?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Linen cloths dipped in equal quan∣tities of vinegar and water should be con∣tinually applied cold to the injured part: the pains will thus be abated, and the ex∣travasated blood absorbed.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>Little ulcers may be dressed with lint; or a linen bandage dipped in vinegar.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 351. How are scalded parts to be cured?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> If (exactly as directed for contusions) linen cloths dipped in cold vinegar and wa∣ter be applied from the beginning, and re∣peated every quarter of an hour, the burns will be cured better than by plasters and salves.</P>

<HEAD>XXIV. Of Diseases which universally pre∣vail; of Endemial, and of particular Maladies.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 352. IF diseases be very prevalent, and attack many, must the healthy take me∣dicines, in order to escape infection?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; a healthy person should never take physic.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 353. Should not people in such a case
<PB N="130" REF="033718_0144_0FF8C4C82DF18538"/>
purge, take emetics or sweating potions, or be bled?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; such weakening remedies would rather favour than prevent infection.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 354. Is it good to take strengthen∣ing medicines for the stomach?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; they are more hurtful than be∣neficial.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 355. What should a person in good health do to escape general contagion?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He should be very temperate in eat∣ing and drinking, be very cleanly, take a great deal of exercise, and be careful not to over-heat himself or to catch cold.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>In times of scarcity, putrid fevers and contagious diseases, which sometimes depopulate whole provinces, are caused by eating bad bread and by unwhole∣some food in general.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 356. Is no other precaution necessary?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; as diseases that generally prevail are often contagious, we should not expose
<PB N="131" REF="033718_0145_0FF91663932A1120"/>ourselves to danger by visiting patients, nurses, or hospitals.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 357. When certain diseases, for in∣stance the ague, are endemial, and stag∣nant waters or marshes in the neighbour∣hood are the cause of such fevers, what should the inhabitants do?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They ought to drain off the waters, and dry the marshes, and the fever will cease; for with the cause the effect natural∣ly ceases.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 358. If mechanics or artisans be often attacked by diseases peculiar to them, a stone-mason, for instance, by consumption, painters by colic, what ought they to do?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They ought, as sensible men, who wish to be healthy and live long, to investi∣gate the true cause of their frequent disease, and strive to find out how they can dimin∣ish or avoid it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>Those who are to lead a sedentary life, females, mechanics, artists, the studi∣ous, ought, from their infancy till the complete shedding of the teeth in the twelfth year, to be exhorted or obliged to take a great deal of bodily exer∣cise

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="25" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>XXV. Of Contagious Diseases.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 359. WHAT diseases are pe∣culiarly contagious?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Putrid fevers, spotted fevers, the yellow and scarlet fever, dysentery, small-pox, and measles. The plague, the worst of all diseases, is very infectious.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 360. How is the infection of them communicated?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By contact, or through the air im∣pregnated with putrid streams or noxious particles proceeding from patients labour∣ing under any of those diseases.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 361. What is particularly to be ob∣served with respect to alleviating the symp∣toms in contagious diseases?</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="033718_0147_0FF9166D56260B40"/><HI>A.</HI> The air, as well in the room as in the house where the patient lies, ought to be preserved continually pure and fresh, by keeping one window always, and the win∣dows and doors occasionally, open. In short, one cannot be too assiduous in procuring constant fresh air.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 362. What is further to be observed?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The greatest cleanliness ought to be observed with regard to the patient, the bed, the room, and attendants, observing not to keep the room too warm.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 363. What else should be done to guard against infection?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Previous to visiting a patient we should take some nourishment;—we should, how∣ever, avoid eating any thing in the apart∣ments of the sick; but be chearful and not timid, and as far as we can, administer re∣lief and comfort.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 364. What duties do those who are intrusted with the care of such patients owe to their fellow-creatures?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They ought, in order to prevent the infection from spreading, to keep by them∣selves, avoid all unnecessary intercourse with other people, and not enter any school
<PB N="134" REF="033718_0148_0FF9166EEA1888F8"/>or church; and the children and domestics of such patients should be placed under the same restraint.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>Contagious diseases are often communica∣ted to schools by children, and so spread to distant parts.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 365. May many persons be admitted into the room of a patient who is infected with a contagious disease?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> None but those that are intrusted with the care of the patient; and and all curi∣ous visitors should be refused admittance without any ceremony.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 366. Why is it a duty incumbent on the healthy to avoid approaching an infected person, when there is no pressing necessity to expose ourselves to contagion?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Because self-preservation, and what we owe to our families and fellow-creatures, directs us not to endanger our own health, and especially not to endanger the health of our fellow-creatures.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="033718_0149_0FF916761D3D4678"/><HI>Q.</HI> 367. If an infected person dies, what is then to be done?</P>

<P><HI>Q.</HI> 368. Is not the itch a contagious disease?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; it is communicated very readily by contact with an infected person.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 369. What must be done to escape this disease?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We must avoid the company of in∣fected persons.</P>

<PB N="136" REF="033718_0150_0FF8C4CA3B94AB98"/>children so infected would soon be found out.</P>

<HEAD>XXVI. Of the Small-Pox.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 371. FROM what can the degree of danger in small-pox be conjectured?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Chiefly from their number. If the pustules be few, there is little danger; but where they are many, and confluent, the danger is great.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 372. What is therefore lucky?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> To have but few pustules.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 373. At what period of the disease may we apprehend danger?</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="033718_0151_0FF9167F2E1D05F0"/><HI>A.</HI> Not at the beginning when the pus∣tules come forth, but towards the end, when they suppurate and dry.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 374. When a child has symptoms of being infected with this disease, is it pro∣per to have recourse to wine, brandy, warm rooms and beds to forward the eruption?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; it would be acting very injudicious∣ly; for by such means we should increase the number of pustules, and consequent∣ly the danger.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 375. What is then to be done?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The cure must be left to nature, ob∣serving only, during the period of the erup∣tive fever, which lasts two, three, or four days, to keep the patient cool and in fresh air, allowing him but little nourishment, and cold water only for drink.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 376. When at last the pustules come out, what must be done in the course of the disease?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We should keep the patient in a situa∣tion where the air is pure, cool, and dry; give for drink cold water, and enjoin tem∣perance and moderation in eating and drink∣ing.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="033718_0152_0FF8C4CC6C36F458"/><HI>Q.</HI> 377. Is it good to lie in bed in the day-time at the period of the eruptive fever, before the eruption of the small-pox, and during the whole course of the disease?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; it is not good in the day-time: the patient, if possible, should keep out of bed, and at night lie in a bed that is not too warm, nor fusty; feather-beds are therefore very hurtful to this class of patients.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 378. When the eye-lids are inflamed and closed. is it right to force them open, and apply to, or blow into, them spices, or other hot things?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; the eye-lids must not be forced open, or meddled with, nor ought inflam∣matory things, which induce blindness, to be applied to them; but when at last they open of themselves care must be taken that the eyes be not irritated by too much light in the room, which should be kept dark∣some, both before and after they open. Particular attention is also to be paid to keeping the air in the room pure and cool.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 379. Is great mortality occasioned by the small-pox?</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="033718_0153_0FF91680D47B7820"/><HI>A.</HI> Yes; in general out of ten patients labouring under the natural small-pox, one dies.</P>

<HEAD>ADDRESS TO CHILDREN.</HEAD>
<P>Children, the natural small-pox is a bad distemper—as bad as the plague? But God has, in his goodness, enabled man to find out a remedy for the alle∣viation of the great miseries occasion∣ed by it. He has led us to the impor∣tant discovery of inoculation, which destroys in a great degree the virulence of this baneful disease.</P>
<P>When children are inoculated they have only a few pustules of the best kind; they are seldom confined to bed; sel∣dom lose their health; and of a hundred inoculated hardly one dies; where∣as one out of ten of those afflicted with the natural small-pox generally dies.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 380. Do you wish to be made ac∣quainted with the process of inoculation?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; if you will be so kind as to ex∣plain it.</P>

<HEAD>INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO INOCULATE.</HEAD>
<P>In order to inoculate a child in a good state of health, a needle is dipped in a little fresh thin matter of true small-pox, with few pustules. With this needle an incision is made of the breadth of a straw under the scarf skin of the arm above the elbow, with∣out drawing any blood, so that the matter shall be lodged under the upper skin; and this is called inoculation for the small-pox.</P>
<P>The effect produced, and the conduct to be observed by the patients, are as fol∣lows: Having the great advantage of knowing to a certainty that the person inoculated will have the small-pox within ten or fourteen days, the stric∣test regularity and temperance with regard to diet is to be enjoined.</P>
<P>The fourth, fifth, or sixth day the in∣cisions become inflamed, red, thick, and hard; and from this time till the complete restoration of the patient to perfect health; the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which are often much inflamed, and from which a great deal of matter <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
<PB N="141" REF="033718_0155_0FF916891C3C0AE8"/>ought to be repeatedly washed every day with cold water.</P>
<P>The seventh, eighth, or ninth day after the inoculation, the patient feels pains under the arm, and is attacked by head-ach, and fever; and sometimes vomits.</P>
<P>This fever lass two, three or four days, during which period the patient should not remain in bed, but, though it may be very inconvenient in the beginning, walk, or be carried about, where there is fresh, pure, cool air, which is abso∣lutely necessary.</P>
<P>In free and cool air, the fever and head-ach go off; and if the forehead and arms be frequently washed in cold wa∣ter, almost all illness will go off.</P>
<P>The second, third, and fourth day of the fever, or the tenth, eleventh, or twelfth day after inoculation, some∣times later, the small-pox come forth of their own accord: they ought not to be forced to make their appear∣ance.</P>
<P>In most cases there are few pustules, which, being good, the disease is soon
<PB N="142" REF="033718_0156_0FF8C4D0A4EC50F8"/>at an end. The pustules in this case contain little matter, and dry soon; and it is only necessary to keep the patient regular and in fresh air, to pre∣vent the disease from becoming dan∣gerous.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 381. Can a person be infected twice by the small-pox?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; the true small-pox cannot in∣fect the same person more than once: all stories of getting the infection twice are erroneous.</P>

<HEAD>XXVII. Of the Measles.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 382. ARE the measles a bad dis∣temper?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; they take away the lives of many; and even after they go off leave be∣hind complaints which often prove fatal.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 383. What may particularly be ob∣served
<PB N="143" REF="033718_0157_0FF9169401306D98"/>with regard to this disease, which is so often hurtful to the lungs.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Patients afflicted with it must be kept a little warmer than is necessary in cases of small pox, but not too warm; they ought to breathe pure air, and great care is to be taken that they do not expose themselves to cold.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 384. When this disease goes off, what are we to do for the patient, that he may not suffer from the consequences of it.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The patient for some time must guard against cold air, and put on warm clothing.</P>

<HEAD>XXVII. Of the Bloody-Flux, or Dysentery.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 385. AT what season doth the bloody-flux commonly appear?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> In the summer, but mostly in the autumn.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="033718_0158_0FF9169BCBEA04B0"/><HI>Q.</HI> 386. Is the bloody-flux a bad and dangerous disease?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; it is a very malignant disease, exposing the patient to great danger, if he be improperly treated.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 387. Is the bloody-flux the conse∣quence of eating fruit?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; ripe, sweet, juicy fruits, rather prevent than produce, this disease.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 388. What precautions ought to be taken to avoid infection?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> People should be very careful to avoid cold, and all unnecessary communication with the sick.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 389. The stomach and bowels of pa∣tients labouring under dysentery, are filled with bitter, acrid, and putrid matter. Is it proper to endeavour to stop the progress of the disease by confining this matter in the stomach and bowels?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; the stopping of the bloody flux would endanger life; but the body ought always to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cleansed by purges, and some∣times by vomits, at the beginning of the disease.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 390. What ought therefore to be avoided?</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="033718_0159_0FF916A2F0AE0D28"/><HI>A.</HI> The stopping of the flux by any means but especially by opium or laudanum, which is very dangerous.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 391. What is further to be observed, as the bloody-flux is often infections?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The greatest cleanliness; filling the patient's chamber with fresh air, and taking great care that any excrements, as soon as voided, be carried out of the room, and buried under much earth.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="30" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>XXX. Of Treatment, after Diseases are removed.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 392. WHAT ought to be ob∣served after severe diseases are removed?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Regularity and temperance in eating and drinking, taking only light nourishing
<PB N="146" REF="033718_0160_0FF8C4DE992F4018"/>food, and observing not to expose ourselves too soon to the weather.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 393. May a person just restored to health set to work immediately?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; a person just risen from the bed of sickness ought first completely to recruit his natural strength before he begins to work again.</P>
