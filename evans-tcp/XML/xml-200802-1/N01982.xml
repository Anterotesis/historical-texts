<HEAD>Nishmath-Chajim. The Probable SEAT of all Diseases, and a General CURE for them, further Discovered.</HEAD>
<HEAD>More particularly, for Splenetic &amp; Hysteric Maladies, which make so great a part of our Distempers.</HEAD>
<P>I. THERE is <HI>a Spirit in Man;</HI> A Wonderful Spirit, which from very good Authority may be called, <HI>NISH∣MATH-CHAJIM,</HI> [Or, <HI>The Breath of Life:</HI>] And which may be of a <HI>Middle Nature,</HI> between the <HI>Rational Soul,</HI> and the <HI>Corporeal Mass;</HI> But may be the <HI>Me∣dium of Communication,</HI> by which they work, upon one another. It Wonderfully receives also <HI>Impressions</HI> from <HI>Both</HI> of them; And Per∣haps it is the <HI>Vital Ty</HI> between them. The Scriptural Anatomy of <HI>Man,</HI> into <HI>Spirit,</HI> and <HI>Soul,</HI> and <HI>Body,</HI> seems to favour and invite the Apprehensions, which we are now proceed∣ing to.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="002352_0003_0FDB2ECA4AD5CDC0"/>
II. THE <HI>Great</HI> GOD <HI>who formed all things,</HI> and who after a Singular manner <HI>forms the Spirit of Man within him,</HI> has Endued this <HI>Nishmath-Chajim,</HI> with Marvellous <HI>Faculties;</HI> which yet are all of them short of those <HI>Powers,</HI> which Enable the <HI>Rational Soul,</HI> to Penetrate into the <HI>Causes of Things;</HI> To Do Curious and Exquisite Things in the <HI>Mathe∣matical Sciences;</HI> And above all, To act upon a Principle of <HI>Love to GOD,</HI> and with the <HI>Views</HI> of <HI>Another World.</HI></P>
<P>III. SOME <HI>Rays of Light</HI> Concerning this <HI>Nishmath-Chajim,</HI> have been darted into the Minds of many Learned Men, who have yet after all remained very much in the <HI>Dark</HI> about it.</P>
<P>FAMOUS have been the Sentiments of <HI>Helmont</HI> (and some other <HI>Masters of Obscuri∣ties</HI>) about it; who would Exhibit it under the Name of the <HI>Archaeus;</HI> and with much of Reason Press, that in the <HI>Care of Diseases,</HI> there may be more of Regard Paid unto it.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to <HI>Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbs</HI> (Writing, <HI>De Ort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Rerum</HI>) it is, <HI>Medium quid inter Vitam at Corpus, et Vel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i Aura nit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Splend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sque▪</HI> A Sort of <HI>Luminous Air,</HI> which is of a <HI>Middle Nature,</HI> Spirituous and Corpor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>us.</P>

<P><PB N="3" REF="002352_0004_0FDB2ECE90672090"/>
EVEN the <HI>Galenists</HI> themselves, have not been without some <HI>Suspicions,</HI> yea, some <HI>Ac∣knowledgments,</HI> of our <HI>Nishmath-Chajim,</HI> and have given very <HI>Broad Hints</HI> Concerning it. And no doubt, they may thank the Old <HI>Platonists</HI> for Instructing of them. The Great <HI>Fernelius,</HI> one of the most Illustrious Men that ever shone among them, (Writing, <HI>De Abditis rerum Causis</HI>) gives a very Lively Description of it. Yea, He finds it in the, <HI>To ENORMON,</HI> or, <HI>Inciter,</HI> of <HI>Hippocrates;</HI> and having a great <HI>Power of Incursion,</HI> like the <HI>Wind,</HI> he allows it some Affinity with the Nature of <HI>Body;</HI> But inasmuch as it is <HI>In∣visible,</HI> it must also have some Affinity with what is <HI>Incorporeal▪</HI> So, he will have it of a <HI>Middle Nature</HI> between <HI>Both.</HI> But he sup∣poses it, the <HI>Vehicle,</HI> and proper Seat of the <HI>Soul,</HI> and all its Faculties; and if we call it, their <HI>Body,</HI> we shall have his Permission for it.</P>
<P>AND indeed, the Old <HI>Platonists</HI> had a No∣tion, of a certain Excellent <HI>Body,</HI> Pelluced, and Ethereal, Subservient unto the Faculties of the <HI>Soul,</HI> and Uniting it unto the more Terrestrial <HI>Body.</HI></P>
<P><HI>HEURNIUS,</HI> whom some Reckon and Value next unto <HI>Fernelius,</HI> (in his Institutions) describes it as, <HI>A kind of Etherial Spirit, Ela∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> out of the purest part of the Blood, and changed into the Substance of a very subtil Air;
<PB N="4" REF="002352_0005_0FDB2ED1CE48E410"/>
and the prime Instrument of the Soul, for the per∣formance of its Functions.</HI></P>
<P><HI>IV.</HI> OUR <HI>Nishmath-Chajim</HI> seems to be Commensurate unto our <HI>Bodies;</HI> and our <HI>Bo∣dies</HI> are Conformable to the Shape which GOD our Maker gives to that <HI>Plastic Spirit,</HI> (if we may call it so:) But by what <HI>Principle</HI> the Particles of it, which may be finer than those of the <HI>Light</HI> it self, are kept in their <HI>Coh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esion</HI> to one another; tis a thing yet Un∣known unto us.</P>
<P><HI>V.</HI> AND how it fares in the Case of <HI>Am∣putations</HI> on our <HI>Bodies;</HI> Whether like a Flame Violently Struck off, what is so, may not nim∣bly, as by a sort of <HI>Magnatism,</HI> Re-unite with what it belongs unto: But then, how far it becomes for the Present folded up into it: Or, Whether it be not Entirely Lost, but what remains, may have the Power to Pro∣duce a <HI>Recruit,</HI> when there shall be a Lodging again Provided for it; This also is yet Un∣known unto us.</P>
<P><HI>VI.</HI> THE <HI>Nishmath-Chajim</HI> is the <HI>Spirit</HI> of the Several <HI>Parts,</HI> where it has a Residence; and it is the <HI>Life</HI> by which the Several Parts have their <HI>Faculties</HI> Maintained in Exercise. <HI>This</HI> tis, that <HI>Sees,</HI> that <HI>Hears,</HI> that <HI>Feels;</HI> and Performs the <HI>Several Digestions</HI> in the <HI>Body.</HI> And the <HI>Animal World,</HI> having <HI>Anima<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sale,</HI> if it were not for <HI>This,</HI> would quickly <HI>Putrify.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002352_0006_0FDB2ED3B4965378"/>
<HI>VII.</HI> WE have sometimes been led by our <HI>Microscopes,</HI> into some Apprehensions, That our <HI>Bodies</HI> are Originally folded up, in In∣conceivably Minute <HI>Corpusculicunicules;</HI> and that Generation is nothing but the <HI>Evolution</HI> of the <HI>Stamina</HI> so Involved: Which Operati∣on is carried on, by <HI>filling them up</HI> with a mat∣ter agreeable to them, till they have an Aug∣mentation to the utmost Extent of the Di∣mensions, that they can reach unto: And that the <HI>Resurrection of the Dead,</HI> which is in the Sacred Scriptures called, <HI>A Filling of the Dead Bodies,</HI> will find out the Old <HI>Stamina</HI> of the Forsaken Body, again Shrunk up into its first Parvity, and Replenish it with a more <HI>Etherial Matter,</HI> fit for the Coelestial Em∣ployments and Enjoyments intended for it. But this Hypothesis is Encumbred with Dif∣ficulties, which drive us unto a <HI>Nishmath-Chajim,</HI> either to Support and Perfect the Hypothesis, or to yield us a Better upon the fai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> of it.</P>
<P><HI>VIII.</HI> THE <HI>Nishmath-Chajim</HI> is indeed, <HI>Generatienis Faber ac Rector;</HI> and as it Leads to the Acts Requisite in <HI>Generation,</HI> without any further <HI>instructor,</HI> So it is the <HI>Spirit,</HI> whose <HI>Way we know not, for Shaping the Bones,</HI> and other Parts, <HI>in the Womb of her that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with Child▪</HI></P>
<P><HI>IX</HI> THERE are indeed many Things in the Humane Body, that cannot be solved by
<PB N="6" REF="002352_0007_0FDB2ED6DB899750"/>
the Rules of <HI>Mechanism.</HI> Our <HI>Nishmath-Cha∣jim</HI> will go very far to help us in the Solution of them. Indeed we can scarce well Sub∣sist without it.</P>
<P><HI>X</HI> THERE is an astonishing Operation, &amp; indeed some Illustration and Explanation, of the <HI>Nishmath Chajim,</HI> in <HI>Pregnant Women;</HI> Whose Imaginations frequently makes Im∣pressions on the <HI>Unborn Infants,</HI> that would Exceed all Belief, if we had them not conti∣nually in View before our Eyes. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>n∣ces are so Numerous and so Various th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> One might Compile a Large Volumn of them; and almost ask a <HI>Paleph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/></HI> to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rd a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie for it. But in what other way to be ac∣counted for?</P>
<P><HI>XI.</HI> FOR the <HI>Nishmath-Chajim</HI> we may safely be <HI>Traducians.</HI> It is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> in, and so Derived from the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> And this <HI>Traductian</HI> (which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>min<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) may help us considerably, in our Enquiries, <HI>How the Dispositions of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Con∣vey'd &amp; Infus'd into us?</HI></P>
<P><HI>XII.</HI> IT was of Old, yea, it is at this day, a prevailing Opinion, among the Strangers to the <HI>Glorious Gospel of the Blessed God;</HI> That the <HI>Manes,</HI> which remain after <HI>Death,</HI> have still an <HI>Humane Shape,</HI> and all the Parts both External &amp; Internal, which there were in the <HI>Body</HI> that is now deserted: yea, That there
<PB N="7" REF="002352_0008_0FDB2ED7D65767F8"/>
is a <HI>Food</HI> which this <HI>Departed Spirit</HI> craves for &amp; Lives on. <HI>Homer</HI> inflicts Punishments on the Wicked after <HI>Death,</HI> which there must be a Sort of <HI>Bodies</HI> to be the Subjects of. And <HI>Plato</HI> Speaks of those that are Punished in <HI>Hell,</HI> as having such <HI>Members</HI> and <HI>Faces</HI> as they had once upon the Earth. Indeed <HI>Justin Martyr</HI> argues from it, that these old Gentlemen must needs have some Knowlege and Belief of our Doctrine of, <HI>The Resurrection of the Dead.</HI> But what shall we say, when our Glorious LORD-REDEMER, in His <HI>Parable of the Rich man,</HI> supposes his <HI>Body</HI> in the <HI>Grave,</HI> and yet being in <HI>Hell,</HI> he cries out of a <HI>Body,</HI> and particularly, of a <HI>Tongue,</HI> that is tormented there? Many of the Ancients thought, there was much of a Real <HI>History</HI> in the <HI>Parable;</HI> and their Opinion was, That there is, <HI>DIA∣PHORA KATATAS MORPHAS, A Distincti∣on</HI> (and so a Resemblance) <HI>of men as to their Shapes after Death.</HI> We find This was the Opi∣nion of <HI>Iraen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s;</HI> who proves, from what our SAVIOUR Speaks of the <HI>Dead Man,</HI> that the <HI>Souls</HI> which have put off their <HI>Bodies,</HI> do yet <HI>Characterem Corporum Custodire,</HI> Preserve the <HI>Shapes</HI> of the Bodies, to which they were United. And from the same Speech of our SAVIOUR, <HI>Tertullian</HI> does infer, <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>igiem Ani∣mae et Corporales Lineas,</HI> the <HI>Shape</HI> and <HI>Corpo∣peral Lineaments</HI> of the Soul, I will say no∣thing
<PB N="8" REF="002352_0009_0FDB2ED95B7C8B78"/>
of what <HI>Thespesius</HI> returning to Life re∣ported about the, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>A TONE PSEUCONE CROMATA, The Colours of Souls,</HI> &amp; the Ulcers by their <HI>Passions</HI> left upon them.</P>
<P><HI>XIII.</HI> THE <HI>Nishmath-Chajim</HI> is much like the <HI>Soul</HI> which animates the <HI>Brutal World;</HI> Even that <HI>spirit of the Beast, which goeth down∣ward unto the Earth;</HI> but is by the Hand of the Glorious Creator impregnated with a <HI>Capacity,</HI> and <HI>Inclination,</HI> for those Actions, which are necessary for the <HI>Preservation</HI> of themselves, &amp; the <HI>Propagation</HI> of their <HI>Species.</HI> The <HI>Nidification</HI> of <HI>Birds,</HI> the <HI>Mollification</HI> of <HI>Bees,</HI> and a Thousand such Things, how sur∣prizing Works done in the Brutal World, without any <HI>Rational Projection</HI> for them! And hence, there are also many Actions done by us, that have a Tendency to our Safety &amp; Welfare, which are not the Effects of any <HI>Rational Projection;</HI> but such as we do by what we call, <HI>A meer Instinct of Nature,</HI> fall into. The <HI>Sucking Infant,</HI> yea, and the <HI>Nursing Mo∣ther</HI> too, do very Needful and Proper Things, without Consulting of <HI>Reason</HI> for the doing of them.</P>
<P><HI>XIV.</HI> HAVING at some time or other felt a Considerable <HI>Smart,</HI> or been Considerably <HI>Sick,</HI> from something that we have met with∣al, we have an <HI>Abiding Horror</HI> for that thing perhaps all our Days. Tho' we <HI>Certainly
<PB N="9" REF="002352_0010_0FDB2EDAC8AEE680"/>
Know</HI> that the Thing will now do us <HI>No Hart,</HI> but rather do us <HI>Much Good,</HI> yet no Convicti∣on of <HI>Reason</HI> will Overcome our <HI>Abiding Hor∣ror,</HI> We cannot Swallow the <HI>Pill,</HI> or take the <HI>Meat</HI> or the <HI>Drink,</HI> &amp; do an hundred Things, which we have heretofore been horribly frighted at. Our <HI>Nishmath-Chajim</HI> has an <HI>ln∣curable Aversion</HI> for them.</P>
<P><HI>XV.</HI> TIS the <HI>Nishmath-Chajim,</HI> that is the <HI>Strength</HI> of every part in our <HI>Body,</HI> and that gives <HI>Motion</HI> to it. Here perhaps the Origin of <HI>Muscular Motion</HI> may be a little accounted for. And this is the <HI>Spirit,</HI> and the <HI>Balsome,</HI> &amp; one might almost say, the <HI>Keeper,</HI> of each part, which is Occupied and Befriended with it. Yea, what Construction shall we make of it, when People have Lived without any <HI>Brains</HI> in their <HI>Heads,</HI> &amp; after the Destructi∣on of almost all the <HI>Bowels</HI> in their <HI>Bodies?</HI> We are supplied and surprized with many most Credible Relations of such Things. And I Question, whither any thing will do so well, or go so far, as our <HI>Nishmath-Chajim,</HI> to ac∣count for them?</P>
<P><HI>XVI.</HI> THE Principal Wheel in the <HI>Ani∣mal Oeconomy,</HI> is the <HI>Stomach.</HI> And we shall now find that which above all things the <HI>Di∣gestion</HI> there, is to be ascribed unto. Dispute, <HI>O Philosophers, and Physicians,</HI> How <HI>Digestion</HI> is Performed in the <HI>Stomach.</HI> Tis the <HI>Nish∣math-Chajim</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="002352_0011_0FDB2EDC4DCC8C08"/>
after all, that is above all, the <HI>Main Digester.</HI> Else, how could a <HI>Stomach</HI> that is actually <HI>Cold,</HI> and has in it no very <HI>Tastable</HI> or <HI>Notable</HI> Humour for this purpose, <HI>Digest</HI> the very <HI>Stones</HI> that are taken down into it?</P>
<P>THE taking of some <HI>Repast,</HI> is in our Sacred Scripture sometimes called, <HI>The Establishing of the Heart.</HI> The <HI>Heart,</HI> is not seldom, a term for our <HI>Nishmath-Chajim.</HI></P>
<P><HI>XVII.</HI> IT is the <HI>Nishmath-Chajim,</HI> that is more Eminently the <HI>Seat</HI> of our <HI>Diseases,</HI> or the <HI>Source</HI> of them. To pass by what they quote of <HI>Herophilus,</HI> we find <HI>Plato</HI> Elegantly Demonstrating▪ That all <HI>Diseases</HI> have their Origin in the <HI>Soul.</HI> Yea, as long ago, as the Days of <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> the <HI>Essentials</HI> of <HI>Diseases</HI> began to be Discovered; and the Pacifying &amp; Rectifying, of the <HI>Enforcing Spirit</HI> was pro∣posed as the most ready way to Cure them.</P>
<P><HI>QUAERE;</HI> How far the Decays of <HI>Old Age</HI> are to be found in the Circumstances of the <HI>Nishmath-Chajim</HI> falling under Impair∣ments? And Whence it came to pass that when <HI>Moses</HI> was very Old, yet <HI>his Eye was not dim, nor his Natural Force abated?</HI></P>
<P>IS not this the true, <HI>Humidum Radicale,</HI> they use to talk of?</P>
<P>AND is not this the <HI>Microcosmic Air,</HI> whereto <HI>Tachenius</HI> ascribes the Cure of the
<PB N="11" REF="002352_0012_0FDB2E899E009290"/>
<HI>Gout</HI> by a strong pertu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> of the Mind; upon which he concludes it animated?</P>
<P><HI>XVIII.</HI> IT is Probable, that when we Dy, the <HI>Nishmath-Chajim,</HI> goes away, as a Vehicle to the <HI>Rational Soul;</HI> and continues unto it an Instrument of many Operations. Here we have some Solution for the Difficulties, about <HI>Place,</HI> and the <HI>Change</HI> of it, for such an <HI>Imma∣terial Spirit</HI> as the <HI>Rational Soul;</HI> And some Account for <HI>Apparitions</HI> of the <HI>Dead:</HI> The <HI>Spectres,</HI> which are called both, <HI>Spirits,</HI> and <HI>Phantasms,</HI> in our <HI>Gospel.</HI> Yea, We are cer∣tain of it, That Persons before they have <HI>Died,</HI> upon strong Desires to Visit and Behold some Objects at a Distance from the <HI>Place</HI> to which they were now Confined, have been thrown into a <HI>Trance,</HI> wherein they have lain some Considerable. While without <HI>Sense</HI> or <HI>Breath;</HI> and then Returning, have reported what they have seen. But incontestible Wit∣nesses have deposed, that <HI>in This Time,</HI> they were actually Seen at the <HI>Place,</HI> which they affirmed they had gone unto.</P>
<P>AND here also we do a little understand, how our Apostle in the Raptures (which the Scoffing <HI>Lucian</HI> derides him for) wherein he supposes he might be <HI>Out of the Body,</HI> yet he <HI>heard Words;</HI> he was yet <HI>Sensible</HI> of <HI>Occurrences.</HI></P>
<P><HI>XIX.</HI> IN the Indisputable and Indubitable Occurrences of <HI>Witchcrafts</HI> (and <HI>Possessions</HI>)
<PB N="12" REF="002352_0013_0FDB2EE25CB2F450"/>
there are many things, which, because they are <HI>Hard to be Understood▪</HI> the <HI>Epicurian-Sad∣ducees</HI> content themselves, in their Swinish Manner, only to Laugh at. But the <HI>Nish∣math-Chajim</HI> well understood, would give us a marvellous Key to let us into the Philoso∣phy of them.</P>
<P><HI>XX.</HI> AND now, for some Important Con∣sequences.</P>
<P>MOST Certainly, the Physicians that can find out Remedies (particularly in the <HI>Mine∣ral</HI> or <HI>Vegitable</HI> Kingdom) that shall have a more Immediate Efficacy to Brighten, and Strengthen, &amp; Comfort, the <HI>Nishmath-Chajim,</HI> will be the most Successful Physician in the World. Especially, if he can Irradiate the Spirit in the <HI>Stomach,</HI> he will <HI>do Wonderfully.</HI></P>
<P>THOSE things also, which Fortify the <HI>Blood,</HI> and restore a <HI>Volatil Ferment,</HI> in the Vapid and Languid <HI>Blood,</HI> will do Wonders for us. It is impossible to Kill a Man (the <HI>Nishmath-Chajim</HI> will never leave him) till the Circulation of his <HI>Blood</HI> be ruined.</P>
<P><HI>XXI.</HI> WE read, <HI>Heaviness in the Heart of man makes it stoop; but a Good Word makes it Glad.</HI> We read, <HI>A Chearful Heart does good like a Medicine; but a broken spirit dries the Bones.</HI> The Invigoration, or the Debilita∣tion of the <HI>Nishmath-Chajim,</HI> is that wherein these ancient Observations are accomplished.</P>

IT is a Remark of <HI>Baglivi,</HI> but it may have been made by Ten Thousand more; <Q>That a great part of our <HI>Diseases,</HI> Either do Rise from, or are Fed by, a Weight of <HI>Cares,</HI> lying on the <HI>Minds</HI> of men. <HI>Diseases</HI> that seem Incurable, are easily Cured by agree∣able <HI>Conversation.</HI> Disorders of the <HI>Mind,</HI> first bring Diseases on the <HI>Stomach;</HI> and so the whole Mass of <HI>Blood</HI> gradually becomes infected. And as long as the <HI>Passions of the Mind</HI> continue, the Diseases may indeed change their <HI>Forms;</HI> but they rarely quit the Patients.</Q></P>
<P>A <HI>BONIFACIUS</HI> heretofore Address'd the Physicians on this Occasion, in such Terms as these. <Q><HI>Tranquility of Mind,</HI> will do Strange Things towards the Relief of <HI>Bodily Mala∣dice.</HI> Tis not without Reason, that <HI>Hofman</HI> in this Dissertation, <HI>Des Moyens de vivre long∣tems,</HI> does insist on <HI>Tranquility of Mind</HI> as the chief among the <HI>Ways to Live Long;</HI> and that this is the cause why we read, <HI>The Fear of the Lord tendeth to Life.</HI> They that have Prac∣tised, <HI>The Art of Curing by Expectation,</HI> have made an Experiment of what the <HI>Mind</HI> will do towards the Cure of the <HI>Body.</HI> By Prac∣tising, <HI>The Art of Curing by Consolation,</HI> you may carry on the Experiment. I Propound then, Let the <HI>Physician</HI> with all possible In∣genuity of <HI>Conversation,</HI> find out, what mat∣ter
<PB N="14" REF="002352_0015_0FDB2EE5958A3C88"/>
of <HI>Anxiety,</HI> there may have been upon the Mind of his <HI>Patient;</HI> what there is, that has made his Life <HI>Uneasy</HI> to him. Having Discovered the <HI>Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n,</HI> let him use all the ways he can devise to take it off. Offer him such <HI>Thoughts,</HI> as may be the best <HI>Ano∣dynes</HI> for his Distressed Mind; especially, the <HI>Right Thoughts of the Righteous,</HI> and the Ways to a Composure upon <HI>Religious Principles.</HI> Give him a <HI>Prospect,</HI> if you can, of some <HI>De∣liverance</HI> from his Distresses, or some <HI>Abate∣ment</HI> of them. Raise in him as <HI>Bright Thoughts</HI> as may be, and Scatter the <HI>Clouds,</HI> remove the <HI>Loads,</HI> which his Mind is Per∣plexed withal: Especially, by Representing and Magnifying the <HI>Mercy</HI> of GOD in CHRIST unto him.</Q></P>
<P><HI>XXII.</HI> IT is well known that if <HI>one Third</HI> of our Diseases, be those which we call, <HI>Chro∣nical,</HI> more than <HI>one Half</HI> of this Third, will be those, which in <HI>Men</HI> go under the Name of <HI>Splenitic,</HI> and in <HI>Women</HI> go under the Name of <HI>Hysteric;</HI> tho' the <HI>Spleen</HI> and the <HI>Womb</HI> are often enough unjustly accused in these De∣nominations. It is marvellous to see, in how many <HI>Forms</HI> we undergo <HI>Splenetic</HI> and <HI>Hysteric</HI> Maladies; The very <HI>Toothache</HI> it self often belongs unto them: And Marvellous will be the <HI>Success,</HI> Marvellous the <HI>Esteem,</HI> of the Phy∣sician that can Discover'em &amp; Encounter'em.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="002352_0016_0FDB2EE8DC3BFB48"/>
THE Sagacious Dr. <HI>Sydenham,</HI> seems to have the Scent of our <HI>Nishmath-Chajim,</HI> when he tells us, That as the <HI>Outward Man</HI> is fram'd with Parts, obvious to <HI>Sense,</HI> thus the <HI>Inward Man</HI> does consist of a due <HI>Series,</HI> and as it were a <HI>Fabric,</HI> or <HI>Spirits,</HI> to be view'd only by the Eye of Reason: And as this is united with the Constitution of the <HI>Body,</HI> so the <HI>Frame</HI> of it is more or less easily Disor∣dered, by how much the <HI>Constitution of the Spirits</HI> is more or less Firm within us. And that the Origin of the <HI>Splenetic</HI> and <HI>Hysteric</HI> Ataxy in the <HI>Body</HI> is a <HI>Feeble Constitution </HI> of the <HI>Spirits,</HI> and the breaking of their <HI>System,</HI> so that they are easily Dissipated, or have an Unequal Distribution.</P>
<P>THESE Maladies have many Symptoms, which may serve as <HI>Diagnosticks</HI> for them; Especially these Two: That the <HI>Urine</HI> is Clear, Limpid, &amp; Copious. And, That the Patient is <HI>Chiefly affected</HI> with his Indispositions, when he has just had his <HI>Mind</HI> under some Distur∣bance and Affliction.</P>
<P>IT is Plain, that these Diseases are not main∣ly in the <HI>Humours;</HI> inasmuch as <HI>Evacuations</HI> do not Relieve, but fearfully Produce &amp; Increase the Diseases. Only indeed, when the Ataxy of the <HI>Spirits,</HI> has by its Continuance at last Considerably Vitiated the <HI>Humours,—Then</HI> a little <HI>Purging</HI> &amp; <HI>Bleeding</HI> may be allow'd of.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="002352_0017_0FDB2EE9D9624A80"/>
THE Cure is; First, <HI>Quiet</HI> the <HI>Spirits</HI> with Proper <HI>Anodynes.</HI> Then bring them to Rights, and Revive them &amp; Refresh them, &amp; bring a <HI>New Strength</HI> into them. In short, <HI>Confirm the System. Chalybeates</HI> do Wonders this way; And usually the Steel in Substance, more than many of the Common Preparations. <HI>Corroborating Plants,</HI> infused in Generous Wine, or a <HI>Tea</HI> of them, have also done Won∣drously. Yea, <HI>Venice-Treacle</HI> alone (our <HI>Sydenham</HI> says) as Contemptible as it may seem, yet if often used, and a long while, it is a Great Remedy in This, as well as very many other Diseases, and perhaps <HI>the most Effectual that has hitherto been known in the World.</HI></P>
<P>THE Force of the <HI>Peruvian Bark</HI> Regularly administred, for giving a Vigour to the <HI>Blood,</HI> and so to the <HI>Spirits,</HI> has also been very Sur∣prising And for the Recovering of People to an Healthy Constitution out of <HI>Splenetic </HI> and <HI>Hysteric</HI> Diseases.</P>
<P>BUT there is nothing like the Exercise of <HI>Riding on Horse-back,</HI> Every Day, when the Weather will allow it; and increasing the Journey by Degrees till one comes to a Score of Miles in a Day.</P>
<P><HI>XXIII.</HI> UPON the Whole;</P>
<P>OF all the Remedies under Heaven, for the Conquering of <HI>Distempers,</HI> &amp; for the Pre∣servation of <HI>Health</HI> &amp; Prolongation of <HI>Life,</HI>

There will now be found none, like Serious PIETY. <HI>Many</HI> Remedies <HI>have done Virtuously</HI> (&amp; had their Virtues) <HI>but thou Excellest thou all.</HI> The <HI>Rational Soul</HI> in its Reflections h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Powerful and Wonderful Influences on the <HI>Nishmath-Chajim.</HI> Now in the Methods of PIETY, get a <HI>Soul</HI> into the <HI>Peace of GOD,</HI> with Assurance of a <HI>Reconciliation</HI> to Him; and <HI>walk in the Fear of GOD,</HI> &amp; the <HI>Comfort of the Holy Spirit;</HI> Keeping always in, and Filled al∣ways with, His <HI>Love;</HI> and Indulge none of those <HI>Lusts,</HI> which render the <HI>Wicked like the Troubled Sea.</HI> Keep a <HI>Conscience,</HI> which in a <HI>Continual Aim</HI> at what is Right shall make a <HI>Continual Feast.</HI> Be not Anxious about <HI>Futuri∣ties,</HI> nor Disturbed upon <HI>Provocations:</HI> But let the <HI>Strong Faith</HI> of a Faithful SAVIOUR <HI>Per∣forming the Thing that is Appointed for us</HI> in all that happens, Produce a perpetual Tranquil∣lity &amp; Serenity in the Soul. Go on <HI>Singing in the Ways of the Lord,</HI> &amp; Casting all <HI>Burdens</HI> on Him, &amp; <HI>Rejoice in the Hope of the Glory of GOD.</HI> Thus, <HI>I show you a most Excellent Way.</HI></P>
<P><HI>XXIV.</HI> LET this be Remembred; Moderate <HI>Ab∣stinence,</HI> &amp; Convenient <HI>Exercise;</HI> and some Guard a∣gainst Injurious <HI>Changes of the Weather,</HI> with an HO∣LY &amp; EASY MIND, will go as far, in Carrying us with <HI>Undecay'd Garments</HI> thro' the Wilderness, to the Promis'd &amp; Pleasant Land, which we are Bound unto, as all the <HI>Prescriptions</HI> with which all the <HI>Physicians</HI> under Heaven, have ever yet Obliged us.</P>
