<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>ENT on Monday and re∣turn'd this Evening from <HI>Ebenezer,</HI> which I have seen with no small Satis∣faction. Surely there is a Difference, even in this Life, between those that serve the LORD and those that serve him not.— All other Places of the Colony seem to be like <HI>Egypt,</HI> where was Darkness; but <HI>Eben∣ezer,</HI> like the Land of <HI>Goshen,</HI> wherein was great Light. For near Four Miles I walk'd in almost one continued Field, with a most plentiful Crop of Corn, Pease,

Potatoes, &amp;c. growing upon it, all the Produce of a few Months Labour. But GOD gives the Labourers a peculiar Blessing. They are unanimous, the Strong help the Weak, and all seem hearty for the common Good. In a few Years the <HI>Saltzburghers,</HI> I believe, will be a flourishing People. Their Land is tolerably good and lies very near the River. They already provide Food, and, ere long, will be capable of providing Raiment for themselves. I shall send them up Cotton, Spinning-Wheels and a Loom, to begin a Manufactory; and next Year, I hope, their own Land will produce enough Flax, Cotton, &amp;c. to carry it on. I had sweet Communion with their Ministers. Our Sister <HI>Orphan-House</HI> there is blessed by their Means; and Yesterday was set apart as a Day of Thanksgiving, for some Assistances lately sent the dear Lambs from <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Savannah.</HI> The People seem very grate∣ful. They willingly receiv'd me into their little but cleanly Huts, and seem'd proud when I would accept any Thing from their Hands. <HI>Blessed be GOD!</HI> Certainly some Blessings are in Reserve for <HI>Georgia.</HI> As I said formerly, so I say again.

She was a great Admirer of Archbishop <HI>Tillotson</HI>; but having her Eyes now open'd to discern spiritual Things, can no longer take up with such Husks, fit only for carnal, unawaken'd, unbe∣lieving Reasoners to eat.

He receiv'd me with much Tenderness and Respect, but thought I went too far in condemn∣ing Archbishop <HI>Tillotson.</HI> I think the Arguments I brought were conclusive; and the Account which my new Convert (being one of his Parishioners) gave of GOD's Dealing with his Soul was rati∣onal, and, as he confessed, satisfactory: But he could not see clearly into the Doc∣trine of Free Justification, without Re∣gard to any Thing foreseen in the Crea∣ture. However, being more noble than most of his other Brethren, he was can∣did and courteous; and, notwitstanding he was in Danger of incurring the Dis∣pleasure of the Commissary there<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>; yet he read Prayers, and requested me to preach in the Evening at his Church. I did, tho' to a small Auditory, there being but little Notice given of my Preaching. After Sermon Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> return'd me Thanks; and having promised to preach again, GOD willing, in my Return to <HI>Savannah,</HI> I took my Leave, and spent the Evening with my Fellow-Travellers at their Relation's House. <HI>May GOD

<P><HI>Thursday, July</HI> 3. Set out Yesterday Morning about One a Clock, and reach∣ed Mr. <HI>Bryan</HI>'s Plantation about Ten. Stayed and dined comfortably together; wrote a few Letters; rode thro' extream Heat, put in and lay at a Planter's House by Reason of the Thunder, Lightning and Rain. Breakfasted this Morning at Mr. <HI>Bee</HI>'s at <HI>Pon-pon</HI>; prayed; talked of the Things of GOD, and was enabled to hold out, notwithstanding the Weather was exceeding hot, till I came to <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> about Eighty Miles from <HI>Beaufort.</HI> Here again my Spirits were much raised, and my Heart comforted by a Packet of Letters from the <HI>Northward,</HI> giving me Account how the Word of the LORD run and was glorified in <HI>Philadelphia</HI> and other adjacent Places: <HI>The LORD's Name be praised from the Rising up of the Sun to the going down of the same.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, July</HI> 4. Lay at a Gentlewo∣man's House who came last Night to give me the Offer of her House. Was visited by many dear Friends of the Town, who were rejoiced to see me. Received a

Wrote several Letters to <HI>Savannah.</HI> Dispatch'd some Affairs for the <HI>Orphan-House,</HI> and preach∣ed in the Evening, in the <HI>Independent</HI> Meeting-House, to as large and attentive a Congregation as usual. <HI>Blessed be GOD for giving the People a hearing Ear. — LORD give them also an obedient Heart, for thy dear Son's Sake!</HI> Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, July</HI> 6. Preach'd twice Yes∣terday and twice to Day, and had great Reason to believe our LORD got himself the Victory in many Hearts: For the Word was attended with Power. Went to Church Morning and Evening, and heard the Commissary preach as virulent and unorthodox, inconsistent Discourse as ever I heard in my Life. His Heart seem'd full of Choler and Resentment. Out of the Abundance thereof, he pour∣ed forth so many bitter Words against the <HI>Methodists</HI> (as he called them) in general, and me in particular, that several who intended to receive the Sacrament at his Hands withdrew. Never, I believe, was such a <HI>Preparation Sermon</HI> preach'd before. I could not help thinking the Preacher was of the same Spirit with the Bishop <HI>Gardner,</HI> in Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Days, Afer Sermon he sent his Clerk to desire me not

<P><HI>Wednesday, July</HI> 9.

Peo∣ple seem'd to come from all Parts, and the Word (as I was told) came with a convincing Power. Having changed my Linnen, which I am obliged to do after every Sermon, by Reason of my prodigi∣ous sweating, I hasten'd away for <HI>Charles-Town</HI>: But my Body was so exceeding weak, and the Sun shone so intensly hot, that Five Miles before I reach'd Town, I called in at a publick House, and lay for a considerable Time almost breathless and dead. But GOD poured ineffable Comforts into my Soul; and being there∣by strengthen'd in the inner Man, I once more set forward with my dear Fellow-Travellers, reach'd Town about Four, and preach'd about Six at the usual Place and with much more Freedom and Power than could any Way be expected, con∣sidering the great Weakness of my Body. But I can do all Things thro' CHRIST'S strengthening me. <HI>I thank thee holy Fa∣ther,</HI> LORD <HI>of Heaven and Earth, that I

Glory be to his most holy Name. <HI>Dagon</HI> seems daily to fall before the Ark. A

Stretch out the golden Scepter of thy Favour, and bruise them no more with thy Iron Rod! Even so, LORD</HI> JESUS, Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, July</HI> 13. Preached this Morn∣ing with much Power, and collected in the Evening for my poor <HI>Orphans.</HI> Great Numbers stood without the Doors, and it raining very hard in the Time of divine Service, many of them were driven away. However GOD caused the other People's Hearts to devise liberal Things, Up∣wards of <HI>Fifty Pounds Sterl.</HI> were collec∣ted on the Occasion. Most shewed a great Readiness to assist me, and the LORD was pleased much to enlarge my Heart to give Praise unto his Name.</P>
<P>In the Morning I went to Church, and heard the Commissary preach: But had some infernal Spirit been sent to draw my Picture, I think it scarcely possible he could paint me in more horrid Colours. I think, if ever, then was the Time that all Manner of Evil was spoken against me falsly for CHRIST's Sake. The Com∣missary
<PB N="15" REF="004846_0014_100E00A5C3F50408"/>
seem'd to ransack Church Histo∣ry, for Instances of Enthusiasm and abu∣sed Grace. He drew a Parallel between me and all the <HI>Oliverians, Ranters, Qua∣kers, French-Prophets,</HI> till he came down to a Family of the <HI>Dutarts,</HI> who lived not many Years ago in <HI>South-Carolina,</HI> and were guilty of the most notorious In∣cests and Murders. To the Honour of GOD's <HI>Free Grace</HI> be it spoken, whilst he was representing me thus, I felt the blessed Spirit strength'ning and refreshing my Soul. GOD at the same Time gave me to see what I was by Nature; how I had deserved his eternal Wrath; and therefore I did not feel the least Resent∣ment against the Preacher. No, I pitied, I prayed for him, and wished from my Soul, that the LORD would convert him, as he did once the Persecutor <HI>Saul,</HI> and let him know that it is JESUS whom he persecutes. In the Evening many came, as I was informed, to hear what I would say; but as the Commissary hinted, that his Sermons should be printed, and as they were full of invidious Falshoods, I held my Tongue and made little or no Re∣ply. <HI>Father forgive him, for he knows not what he does!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, July</HI> 19. Preached all this Week twice every Day at <HI>Charles-Town,</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="004846_0015_100E00A8C0650B30"/>
except on Wednesday and Thursday E∣vening, the last of which Days I was cal∣led upon to appear in Court; and on the former was desired to go to <HI>James's Island,</HI> to preach at the House of one Madam <HI>Woodard.</HI> This Gentlewoman, as she informed me herself, was once much prejudiced against me, insomuch that she thought it dangerous to come and hear me: But having read my Ser∣mons, she changed her Mind, and coming both to Town and to <HI>John's Island</HI> to hear me preach, was, with her Daughter and another Gentlewoman, much melted down. Being given to Hospitality, she provided Food sufficient for a great Mul∣titude. People came from Town and all the other neighbouring Places. Her Barn was put into proper Order, and I read Prayers and preached in it, with much of GOD's blessed Spirit in my Soul. A lovely Melting was visible in several Parts of the Auditory. After Sermon, GOD enabled me to speak many Gospel Truths a midst a polite Set of People; and at the Request of Madam <HI>Woodard</HI> I stayed all Night. This gave me an Opportuni∣ty of teaching her Family the Way of GOD more perfectly, and also of resting my weary Body, which seems to be de∣clining more and more every Day. —

<P><HI>Tuesday, July</HI> 15. I appeared, accord∣ing to the Citation, at the appointed Hour and Place. There were very many Spectators; and the Rev. Mr. <HI>Garden,</HI> Commissary, The Rev. Mr. <HI>Guy,</HI> The Rev. Mr. <HI>Mellichamp,</HI> The Rev. Mr. <HI>Roe,</HI> The Rev. Mr. <HI>Orr,</HI> sat as Judges: They received me with good Manners; and after the Clerk of the Court had ta∣ken a Minute of their Appearing, the Commissary tender'd to me a Paper, de∣siring my Answer to those Articles, but I refused taking it, till I was satisfied of the Authority of the Court in Question, adding, do you think I would in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur a Premunire of doing what I could not answer? (or Words to that Effect) He then said, they would proceed to censure; upon which, I reminded them of the Ex∣ample of the Magistrates, who exceeded their Authority, in condemning and scourging St. <HI>Paul</HI>; being a <HI>Roman,</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="004846_0019_100E00B064C58748"/>
unheard. At this one of the Clergy sneer'd; but the Commi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ary replied,
<Q>We shall not go beyond o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Power, or scourge you.</Q>
After a short Debate the Commissary sent his Apparitor to his House for his Commission, in order to give me Satisfaction. In about a Quar∣ter of an Hour he return'd, with several Bundles of Papers, out of which the Com∣missary first produced his Commission to act as Commissary from the Bishop of <HI>London.</HI> I read and approved of it: But at the same Time desired to be satisfied of the Bishop of <HI>London</HI>'s Authority in this Province, not finding the Royal Au∣thority underwritten, as mention'd in his publick Citation: Upon this a Latin Commission without a Seal, was order'd to be read by the Clerk of the Court. I objected, That it was in Latin contrary to our late Act, ordering every Thing to be in English; and not well understand∣ing the Clerk as he read it, I desired the Perusal of it myself, which was granted. I read it with an audible Voice; and after reading it, I objected, That tho' there might be a general Power given to the Bishop, to exercise ecclesiastical Jurisdic∣tion in this Province; yet the Extent of that Power was to be determined by par∣ticular Acts of Assembly. I farther urged,
<PB N="21" REF="004846_0020_100E00B2A2A78948"/>
That a Court of this Nature was intirely unpresidented in <HI>America</HI>: that I belong∣ed to <HI>Georgia,</HI> a different Province, and was here only as an Itinerate. I also ad∣ded, That my Lord of <HI>London,</HI> tho' I preached in the Fields for some Months, never attempted to exercise such Autho∣rity against me. The Commissary repli∣ed, Tho' I belonged to <HI>Georgia,</HI> yet I had committed Irregularities <HI>here,</HI> and there∣fore came under his Cognizance; and that what he had to lay to my Charge might be Crimes of a different Nature.</P>
<P>Not satisfied with my Objections, he order'd the Clerk to minute down, That I contumaciously contemned the Autho∣rity of the Court. But I desired that Expression might be softned, declaring from my Heart, That what I did, pro∣ceeded from a real Scruple concerning their Authority, urging the Example of King <HI>Charles,</HI> who, before he made An∣swer to his Accusers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sisted on knowing the Authority his Judges had to call him to an Account. I further objected, That the Commissaries in <HI>Maryland</HI> and <HI>Penn∣sylvania</HI> were mere Cyphers, That the <HI>Trustees,</HI> to my Knowledge, question'd the Bishop of <HI>London</HI>'s having any Juris∣diction in these Parts; and that the Governor of <HI>Maryland,</HI> acting as Ordi∣nary,
<PB N="22" REF="004846_0021_100E00B4CD1359E0"/>
had summoned his Clergy lately to meet him as such, which accordingly they did. I therefore upon the whole, humbly desired, as a Favour from the Court, that I might have till to Morrow Nine a Clock, the Time to which the Court was adjourned, to inform myself of the Extent of their ecclesiastical Jurisdiction in this Province, assuring them, that upon find∣ing their Authority valid, I would im∣mediately answer to any Interrogatories, and would be ready to receive any Sen∣tence they could with Justice pass upon me. Tho' at my first asking he said, He had indulged me too far already; yet, after some Consideration, Mr. Commissa∣ry ordered the Clerk to raze out the for∣mer Minute, and to record, That upon my scrupling the Authority of the Court I was indulged my Request.</P>
<P>Our LORD was pleased to fulfil his Promise made to those that should be cal∣led before Rulers and Governors for his Name-Sake. My Soul was full of Peace. I pitied, but did not feel the least Emo∣tion of Resentment against my Judges. The People behaved pretty quiet; but some broke out into a Laughter, some∣thing irregular, when I said, the Com∣missaries in <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> and <HI>Maryland</HI> were but Cyphers. This I disapproved
<PB N="23" REF="004846_0022_100E00B65E2B82C0"/>
of, and checked immediately. After the Court was adjourned and the Commissary rose from his Seat, I made my Obeisance and returned to my Lodgings, thinking myself more highly honour'd, by my LORD, this Morning than in any other Part of my Life. <HI>LORD strengthen me in all my other impending Trials, for thy great Name's Sake.</HI> Amen <HI>and</HI> Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday, July</HI> 16. Appeared this Morning at the Hour of <HI>Ten,</HI> and exhi∣bited a <HI>Recusatio Judicis,</HI> i. e. my Ex∣ceptions against the Commissary's being my Judge in this Cause, having too great Reason to believe him prejudiced against me. At first the Commissary refused to read it, insisting to know first whether I acknowledged the Authority of the Court? Unwarily I answer'd, Yes. But upon the Motion of my Advocate, Mr. <HI>Rut∣ledge,</HI> I recalled my W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rds and said, I admitted and submitted to an Ecclesiasti∣cal Court legally constituted. One of the Clergy on the Bench would have in∣sisted on my first Answer. But I told him, It was mean-spirited and beneath a Court, consisting of those that called themselves Ministers of JESUS CHRIST, to catch at an Expression which I imme∣diately corrected. Upon this, the Bench agreed to alter the Minute agreeable to
<PB N="24" REF="004846_0023_100E00B88BDDEB08"/>
my last Declaration. The Commissary then took my Paper, read it to himself, and said, he would not accept of it. I then stood up according to Law and said, I would go and protest against all further Proceedings, as null and void, and imme∣diately left the Court. Upon Mr. <HI>Rut∣ledge</HI> his Advice I returned and declared, That I appealed <HI>apud acta</HI> to the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> and then withdrew a second Time.</P>
<P>We had not gone far from the Place of Judicature, but I was called back by the Apparitor and Register. We returned, and at the Commissary's Desire gave in my Exceptions to be read and filed.</P>
<P>By this Time Mr. Commissary had gotten one Mr. <HI>Graham,</HI> an Attorney, to appear in Behalf of the Court, who in∣sisted on having the Merits of my Excep∣tions tried in Court. But, as according to Law, I had referred them to the Ex∣amination of Six Arbitrators, three no∣minated by me, and three by the Com∣missary, Mr. <HI>Rutledge,</HI> in my Behalf, protested against all further Proceedings, and against my appearing at the next Court, till my Reference to Arbitrators was complied with, it being quite impro∣bable to imagine, that Mr. Commissary, who must be Judge (if my Exceptions
<PB N="25" REF="004846_0024_100E00BAB3F3F510"/>
should be tried by that Court) should al∣low himself prejudiced.</P>
<P>This <HI>Recusatio Judicis</HI> I exhibited by the Advice of my Friends, not to quibble with or evade the Force or Rigour of any Law whatsoever, that I might justly fall under. For when the Articles of Impeachment were read, I found myself accused only of omitting to read the Com∣mon-Prayer in the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Meeting▪ at such Times as I preached there. <HI>Oh that my Adversaries may never have any Thing worse to lay to my Charge!</HI></P>
<P>The Spectators were rather more nu∣merous than Yesterday; they behaved quietly, and were much rejoiced to see my Opposers reduced to such a Dilemma. Well said the Psalmist, <HI>the Wrath of Man shall turn to thy Praise. — Great GOD, the Remainder of it do thou restrain; and for thy own Name Sake deliver me from the Hands of unreasonable Men, who, out of a misguided Zeal and without Cause, are mine Enemies!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday, July</HI> 17. By Advice of Mr. <HI>Rutledge,</HI> appear'd in Court at the Time of their Meeting, to see if my Exceptions were admitted to Arbitration or repelled. The Court being open'd, Mr. Commis∣sary asked me, If I was prepared to an∣swer the Articles objected against me?
<PB N="26" REF="004846_0025_100E00BCDD53F328"/>
I replied, I could give no Answer, till my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onceptions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>were referred to Arbitrators. Mr. <HI>Rutledge</HI> stood up and spoke some few<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Word's in Vindication of my Ob∣jections proving, by a Book of Ecclesi∣astical Law, That my Proceedings were according to the Rules therein prescribed</P>
<P>The Register was ordered to read their Reasons for repelling my Exceptions. Mr. <HI>Graham</HI> endeavoured to enforce, ha∣ving first laboured to prove the Jurisdic∣tion. of the Court, and to remove the Appehensions the Country in general, or Dissentels in particular, might entertain concerning the ill Consequences of such a Court's being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reated. He held on without Interruption for a considerable Time; but Mr. <HI>Rutledge</HI> rising up to in∣validate what he had said, was stopped. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>length therefore, finding my Excepti∣ons repelled, I appealed to his Majesty in the High Court of Chancery, and de∣clared all other Proceedings in that Court against me to be null and void. This c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sed many to rejoice and give Thanks into GOD in my Behalf. And my dear Redeemer, to comfort my Heart, by his good Providence, at my Return to my Lodgings, sent me several Letters from <HI>Philadelphia,</HI>acquainting me how migh∣tily the Word of GOD grew and pre∣vailed
<PB N="27" REF="004846_0026_100E00BF4DDDBA78"/>
in those Parts. As also Mr. <HI>Bolten,</HI> who lately kept an Assembly-House, and whose Daughter, not long since, was con∣verted at <HI>Georgia,</HI> wrote me Word, that he had near <HI>Fifty</HI> Negroes now learning to read of him: And further, that the People of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> at their own Ex∣pence and Accord, were building a Place for me against Winter, <HI>One Hundred</HI> Feet long and <HI>Seventy</HI> Foot wide. <HI>LORD, do thou fill it with thy Presence, and grant, that all that come thither to worship, may worship thee in Spirit and in Truth!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, July</HI> 19. After Evening Meeting, was desired by the Apparitor to come and wai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on Mr. Commissary, who was sitting in Court▪ I went. He desired me to deposite <HI>Ten Pounds Sterl.</HI> and to swear, That I would lodge my Appeal within a Twelve-Month. My Lawyer not being present, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my Friends were too sollicitous for my Non-compli∣ance: But being to leave Town on Mon∣day, and finding the Commissary's print∣ed Orders gave him Authority to require it, I took the desired Oath, promised to leave <HI>Ten Pounds</HI> in a Friend's Hands; but withal, moved for a Copy of the Court's Proceedings, which was readily complied with.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="004846_0027_100E00C102200970"/>The Court being ended, the Commis∣sary desired to speak with me. I asked him to go my Lodgings. He chose to walk in a Green near the Church. His Spirit was something calmer than usual; but after an Hour's Conversation we were as far from agreeing as before. He char∣ged me with speaking Blasphemy, for saying, That if it was in my Power, I would place him at the Right Hand of GOD. Upon my desiring to know wherein the Blasphemy consisted: He re∣plied, Where then will you put CHRIST? I asked him▪ Why he was guilty of that Fault, which he charged me with, viz. In accusing the <HI>Methodists</HI> in general, when he only referr'd to Things wrote or done by me in particular? He answered, Because we were all of one Mind, he supposed. When I question'd him, Why he ridiculed me for making Grimaces in the Pulpit, when he did not come to hear me? Why, says he, as I passed by one Day, I saw you spreading out your Hands. I replied, Did not <HI>Paul</HI> do so when he began to preach? In short, all his Dis∣course was so inconsistent, and contrary to the Gospel of our LORD, that I was obliged to tell him, That I believed him to be an unconverted Man, an Enemy to GOD, and of a like Spirit with the
<PB N="29" REF="004846_0028_100E00C2DC877398"/>
Persecutor <HI>Saul.</HI> At this he smiled; and after we had walked for a long while, we parted, and GOD gave me great Satis∣faction, that I had delivered my Soul in my Private Conversation with the Commissary. <HI>O Father, give him also Peace and Joy in Believing through</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>the Son of thy Love!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, July</HI> 20. Preached this Morn∣ing as usual; and went afterwards to Church to hear the Commissary. His Text was, <HI>Take Heed how ye hear.</HI> At first I thought we should have a peaceable Sermon, especially since we had conversed before so amicably: but the Gall soon be∣gan to flow from his Tongue, tho' not with so much Bitterness as the last Sunday. He endeavour'd to apologise for his Pro∣ceedings, condemned all that followed me, and gave all Hopes of Heaven, that ad∣hered to him and the Church. In the Evening (tho I went off my Bed to do it, and was carried in a Chaise) the LORD JESUS strengthned me to take my last Farewel of the dear People of <HI>Charlestown.</HI> My Soul was fu ll of Tenderness for them, and many seem'd to sympathize with me. <HI>Blessed be GOD</HI> for sending me once more among them! Tho' the Heat of the Weather and Frequency of Preaching has perhaps given an irrecoverable Stroke to the Health
<PB N="30" REF="004846_0029_100E00C5049B65C8"/>
of my Body; yet I rejoice, knowing it has been for the Conviction and I believe Conversion of many Souls. <HI>Glory be to GOD on high!</HI> the Fields here, as well as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lsewhere, are now <HI>white ready unto Har∣v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st.</HI> Numbers are seeking after JESUS. And two or three gracious-dissenting Mi∣nisters, by my Advice, agreed to set up a Weekly Lecture. I advised the People, since the Gospel was not preach'd in the Church, to go and hear it in the Meeting-Houses. <HI>May the LORD be with both Ministers and People, and cause them to preach and hear, as becomes the Gospel of CHRIST.</HI> What makes the Change more remarkable in <HI>Charles-Town</HI> People, is, That they seemed to me at my first Coming, to be a People <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olly devoted to Pleasure. One well acquainted with their Circumstances and Manners, told me, more had been annually spent on Po∣lite Entertainments, that the Poor's Rate came to. But now the Jewellers and Dancing-Masters begin to cry out, <HI>That their Craft is in Danger.</HI> A vast Alter∣ation is discernable in the Ladies Dress: And some, whilst I have been speaking, have been so convinced of the Sin of Wearing Jewels, that I have seen them with Blu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ies, put their Hands to their Ears and cover them with their Mobs.
<PB N="31" REF="004846_0030_100E00C7D3E12C20"/>
But I hope the Reformation has went far∣ther than Externals. Many moral, good Sort of Men, who before were settled up∣on their Lees, have been gloriously awa∣kened to seek after JESUS CHRIST. And many a <HI>Lydia</HI>'s Heart hath the LORD open'd to receive the Things that were spoken. Indeed the Word came often like a Hammer and a Fire. And a Door, I believe, will be opened for teaching the poor Negroes. Several of them have done their usual Work in less Time, that they might come to hear me. Many of their Owners, who have been awakened, re∣solve to teach them Christianity. Had I Time and proper School-Masters, I might immediately erect a Negreo-School in <HI>South-Carolina</HI> as well as <HI>Pennsylvania.</HI> Many would willingly, contribute <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Money and Land.

I fear'd sometimes they would be too hot; but I endeavour'd to stop their Resentments against the Commissary, as much as possible, and re∣commended Peace and Moderation to them in most of my Discour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>▪ <HI>May

<P><HI>Monday, July</HI> 22. Left <HI>Charles-Town</HI> very early, accompanied by many of the Inhabitants, who I hope will prove true Followers of the Lamb.

but (as I was afterwards informed) not without some good Effect. Sermon being over, I went on Horse-back to <HI>Good-Hope,</HI> where Mr. <HI>Hugh Bryan</HI> lived, and several followed, hoping I would preach again in the Evening: But here my bodily Strength so failed me, and GOD poured such ineffable Thirstings▪ and Hungrings in my Soul after him, that I sometimes hoped he was about to set my imprisoned Soul at Liberty. <HI>Surely my GOD then placed me upon Mount Pisgah, and gave me a distant Prospect of the Heavenly</HI> Canaan! Every Limb stretched for Immortality, and I long∣ed for the blessed Angels to come and carry me to <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Harbour. These Words, "I know that my Redeemer liveth," with wonderful Sweetness and Power were pressed upon me; and the Thoughts of my Saviour's dying Love, and of the LORD's being <HI>my</HI> Righteousness, melted me into Tears. My dear Friend and Com∣panion wept over me, answer'd almost Tear for Tear, and seemed willing to take his Flight with me into the Arms of our beloved JESUS. The poor Negroes crow∣ded round the Windows, and by their Looks and Officiousness express'd a great Concern for me. Their Master had ac∣quainted them, I believe, that I was their Friend: He himself sat by, and wept too:

But alas! GOD soon shewed me, that the Time of my Departure was not yet at Hand: In a short Time I perceived my Body grew stronger, and I was enabled to walk about. As well as I could, I joined in Family-Prayer.

My Body being weak, it could not bear up under the Joy and Satisfaction which I felt in my Mind. However, I kneel'd down, wept out a short Prayer and Thanksgiving, and as well as I could, told my Assistants what GOD had done for my Soul. In the Evening I expound∣ed, and undesignedly, thinking it was the Lesson for the Night, read the last Chapter of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s second Epistle to <HI>Timothy,</HI> in which were these encouraging Wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,

But last Night, through Weakness of Body, and a prodi∣gious Concern which lay upon my Soul on Account of some domestick Trials, just as I began Family Prayer, I was struck, as I thought, almost for Death. I put up a few broken Accents, and breath'd out, <HI>LORD</HI> JESUS <HI>receive my Spirit.</HI> This Morning my Master shewed me
<PB N="38" REF="004846_0037_100E00D7641B6C68"/>
why I was thus humbled: Soon after I rose, I found that Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> and his Wife of <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> Mr. <HI>Jonathan Bryan,</HI> Brother to Mr. <HI>Hugh Bryan,</HI> and one Mr. <HI>Bull,</HI> were come to pay us a Visit. Tho' exceeding weak, and I had almost laid aside Thoughts of officiating this Day; yet up∣on Mr. <HI>Jones</HI>'s Intimating that Friends came expecting to hear me, I promised, if I could, to preach, and beg'd him to read Prayers: He did; but I found my∣self so ill that I would fain have persuaded Mr. <HI>Tilly</HI> to preach for me: He peremp∣torily refused, urging that GOD would strengthen me if I begun. Upon this I stood up, and soon found Power communi∣cated to me from above. I felt a sweet Melting in my Soul: And 'ere I had pray∣ed long Mr. <HI>Bull</HI> dropped down as tho' shot with a Gun. He soon got up, and sat attentively to hear the Sermon. The Power soon spread abroad; the greatest Part of the Congregation was under Con∣cern: Tears trickled down apace. GOD manifested himself also much amongst us during the Time of the Sacrament. And I went home ashamed that I was so un∣willing to preach. I stood justly reproved when Mr. <HI>Tilly</HI> after we came home, said, <HI>Did I not tell you, GOD would strengthen you? Dearest-LORD for thy Mercies sake

<P><HI>Monday, August</HI> 4. Was sent for about Noon to see Mr. <HI>Jonathan Bryan.</HI> At my Coming I found him under great Concern and strong Convictions of Sin. Oh, how did he reflect on his past mispent Life! How did he bless GOD▪ for bringing him to <HI>Savannah!</HI> How did he desire that he might be found in CHRIST 'ere he re∣turned home! His Wife sat Weeping by, and Mr. <HI>Bull</HI> lay on a Bed, Groaning in Bitterness of Soul, under a Sense of Guilt, and Crying out for an Interest in CHRIST. I asked him what caused him to fall down Yesterday: He answered, the Power of GOD's Word. After about half an Hour's Conversation on the Nature of the New-Birth, and the Necessity of a saving Closure with the LORD CHRIST, I kneeled down and prayed with them, and then took my Leave, hoping the LORD would pluck them as Fire-Brands out of the Fire. <HI>Even so,</HI> LORD JESUS.

<P><HI>Sunday, August</HI> 9. Went on <HI>Tuesday</HI> with Mr. <HI>Bryan, Jones, &amp;c.</HI> to <HI>Bethesda,</HI> and had the Pleasure of seeing the Work of GOD much carried on in most of our Visiters Hearts. It was but seldom I could officiate, but when I did the LORD
<PB N="40" REF="004846_0039_100E00DBC9F03468"/>
generally caused the Word to come with very great Power. This Morning I ex∣pounded early, as usual, and read Part of the Prayers at Ten a Clock; but got Mr. <HI>Tilly</HI> to preach; who tho' a <HI>Baptist</HI> Mini∣ster, joined with us in receiving the Sacra∣ment in the <HI>Church of England</HI> Way.
<Q>And the King was pleas'd to sit at his Table. He brought us into his Ban∣quetting-House, and caused it to be a Feast of fat Things to our Souls.</Q>
Many, I believe, fed on JESUS in their Hearts with Thanksgiving. After the Ordinance was over, the LORD enlarged my Heart, and I prayed as the Spirit gave me Utterance. I went home, much re∣freshed in Soul, but so weak in Body, that I declined going to publick Worship in the Afternoon. In the mean while, GOD gave me a fresh supply of Strength. A∣bout the Evening, when my Friends were sitting down together, finding the Power of the LORD come upon me, I began to speak to them of the Things of GOD. A great Alteration was soon dis∣cernable in most of the Company. Their Concern gradually increased, till many burst into Floods of Tears; and one fell on the Ground. 'Ere I had done, some of my Parishioners came up, and the rest of my Family: They also felt the Divine
<PB N="41" REF="004846_0040_100E00DD52E1BD80"/>
Power. When I had done speaking to them from GOD, I spoke for them in Prayer to GOD: My Soul was carried as it were out of the Body, and I was en∣abled to wrestle mightily with our LORD in their Behalf. He did not let us go without a Blessing. The Room was filled with the Cries of those around me; and many, I believe, at that Time sought JESUS Sorrowing. The Concern conti∣nued after the Duty was over. Several were in great Agonies of Soul; and a <HI>Cherikee</HI> Indian-Trader, who providential∣ly was present, desired to speak with me, saying, <HI>He never saw the like before.</HI> Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> also, of <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> who went away on <HI>Friday,</HI> but was forced back, and offi∣ciated for me this Afternoon at <HI>Savannah,</HI> told a Friend, that <HI>Surely GOD was with us?</HI> Blessed be His rich, sovereign and distinguishing Grace. <HI>LORD make me lowly in my own Eyes, and cause me still to go on from Conquering to conquer!

Trials this Week than ever I was visited with before. Was forced, several Times, to come out, thro' Concern of Soul and Weakness of Body, in the Midst of Publick Worship; and had not GOD uncommonly supported me, I must fre∣quently have given up the Ghost. But as Troubles abounded, Consolations abound∣ed also. These Words, <HI>But</HI> David <HI>strengthned himself in the LORD his GOD,</HI> were pressed with a wonderful supporting Power upon my Soul. The <HI>Eleventh</HI> of <HI>Hebrews</HI> also was blessed to me; I found the Benefit of being afflicted, GOD en∣abled me to sanctify him in my Heart; and my greatest Grief was▪ that I should be so naughty as to oblige my Heavenly Father to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hastize and scourge me.—LORD <HI>I adore thy infinite condescending Goodness! Oh do not leave me to myself, but purge, oh purge me for thy Mercies Sake, that I may bring forth more Fruit!</HI></P>

and was so filled with the Love of CHRIST, in this Evening's Exposition and my private Farewel-Discourse to my Family, that I could almost say, I was within the Veil. My Hearers, both in private and publick, were vastly affected; and a strange Woman was so touched, that she came to me, confessing her Sins and crying out, <HI>What shall I do to be saved?</HI> When I came to converse with her, I found GOD had struck her the last Time I preached at <HI>Port-Royal;</HI> and I hope he will now call her effectually by his Grace. Pleased, and I hope in some Measure thankful to the LORD of all LORDS, for setting such Seals to my Ministry just at Departure.

safe at <HI>Charles-Town</HI> about Fourth Afternoon. Many came to the Whar and saluted me most kindly. I retired a soon as possible to my old Lodgings, and spent the Evening most sweetly at the House of Mr. <HI>Fowler,</HI> where I hope many true Disciples of the blessed JESUS were met together. The LORD, who once came to the Eleven by Night and said, <HI>Peace be unto you,</HI> I am persuaded by his Spirit spoke to many of them.

<P><HI>Monday, September</HI> 1. Being but weak in Body (except on Sundays) I have preached only once every Day; but I think with greater Power than ever, and with greater Success. I scarce know the Time wherein I did not see a considerable Melting in some Part or other of the Con∣gregation, and often it spread over the whole. Several Times I was so weak be∣fore I began to preach, that I thought it almost impossible I should go through half a Discourse; but the LORD quickened, enlightened and supported me above mea∣sure. Out of Weakness I became strong, and the LORD manifested himself in the Sanctuary. The Audiences were more
<PB N="45" REF="004846_0044_100E00E591AE0BF8"/>
numerous than ever, and it was supposed not less than Four Thousand were in and about the Meeting-House when I preach∣ed my Farewel-Sermon. The Commi∣ssary, having run his utmost Length, thought it best to say no more himself; but he employed one Mr. <HI>Rowe</HI> to preach for him, who told the People, that because of their Wickedness, GOD had sent them strong Delusion, that they might believe a Lie. Finding when I was here last, that JESUS CHRIST was not preached in the Church, my Conscience would not suffer me to attend on those that preach there any more: I therefore went to the <HI>Bap∣tist</HI> and <HI>Independant</HI> Meeting-House, where JESUS CHRIST, I hope, was preached in Sincerity. I likewise administred the Sa∣crament thrice in a private House, <HI>viz.</HI> Yesterday was seven-night, Yesterday, and this Morning. Never did I see any Thing more solemn. The Room was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arge, and most were dissolved into Tears <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s tho' they were weeping at their SAVI∣OUR'S Cross.

<HI>Baptists, Church-Folks</HI> and <HI>Presbyterians</HI> all joined together, and received accord∣ing to the <HI>Church of England,</HI> except two, who desired to have it sitting. I willing∣ly complied, knowing it was a Thing quite indifferent. Many others hearing how GOD was amongst us Yesterday, de∣sired I would administer to them to Day. I did, and our Lord was with us again. Having more Leisure from my private Studies, by Reason my Weakness would not permit me to read much, I had better Opportunities of conversing with, and confirming those that were under Con∣victions. Most of them I found grown in Grace, and their Hearts softned by re∣deeming Love. Mr. <HI>Jonathan Bryan</HI> and Mr. <HI>Bull</HI> came to <HI>Charlestown,</HI> I hope, much established Mr. <HI>Hugh Bryan</HI> they left sick at Home, drinking deeply of the Cup: of GOD's Consolations.

Every Night, where I was invited to Supper, it became customary to have the House filled with Company, whom the LORD enabled me to pray with and exhort, with great Pow∣er; but once I was so weak, that I was obliged to be led Home. Many came to me in private under the deepest Convic∣tions. Several were esteemed mad by their Relations: One young Lady in par∣ticular, for some little Time, was turned out of Doors, but afterwards was recalled again. And one Tradesman, who was looked upon as a very-good Man, was convinced of his <HI>Self-Righteousness</HI> in an extraordinary.

after the Beginning of Evening Service. We came purposely thither first with our Sloop. I think it the most pleasant En∣trance I ever yet saw. Almost. all the Morning the Wind was contrary; but I found a very strong Inclination to pray▪ that we might arrive time enough to be present at publick Worship. Once I cal∣led the People, but something prevented their coming: At last, finding my Im∣pression increase upon me, I desired their Attendance immediately. They came. With a strong Assurance that we should be heard, we prayed, that the LORD would turn the Wind that we might give him Thanks in the great Congregation; and also, that he would send such to us as he would have us to converse with, and who might shew us a Lodging. Tho' the Wind was a-head when we began; yet, when we had done praying and come up out of the Cabbin, it was quite fair. With a gentle Gale we sailed most pleasantly into the Harbour, got into pub∣lick Worship before they had finished the Psalms, and sat, as I thought, undisco∣ver'd After Service was over, a Gentle∣man asked me, whether my Name was not <HI>Whitefield</HI>?

Necessaries for me and my Friends. I went; silently admiring God's Goodness in answering my Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yer so minutely. Several Gentlemen of the Town soon came to pay their Respects to me, amongst whom was one Mr. <HI>Cla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p</HI> an aged <HI>Dis∣senting</HI> Minister, but the most venerable Man I ever saw in my Life: He looked like a good old <HI>Puritan,</HI> and gave me an Idea of what Stamp those Men were, who first settled <HI>New-England.</HI> His Counte∣nance was very heavenly: He rejoiced much in Spirit at the Sight of me, and prayed most affectionately for a Blessing on my coming to <HI>Rhode-Island.</HI> In the Evening, with him and some more Friends, I waited on Mr. <HI>Honeyman,</HI> the Minister of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and de∣sired the Use of his Pulpit. At first he seem∣ed a little unwilling, being desirous to know what extraordinary Call I had to preach on Week-Days, which he said was disor∣derly. I answered, St <HI>Paul</HI> exhorted <HI>Ti∣mothy</HI> to be instant in Season and out of Season; that if the Orders of the Church were rightly complied with, our Ministers should read publick Prayers twice every Day, and then it would not be disorderly, at such Time, to give the People a Ser∣mon. As to an extraordinary Call, I told him I clai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d none but that Injunction of

the Apostle, <HI>as we have Opportunity, let us do good unto all Men.</HI> He still held out, and did not give any positive An∣swer; but at last, after he had withdrawn and consulted with the Gentlemen, he said, if my Preaching would promote the Glory of GOD and the Good of Souls, I was welcome to his Church as often as I would, during my Stay in Town. We then agreed to make Use of it, at Ten in the Morning and Three in the Afternoon. After this, I went and waited on the Go∣vernor, who seemed to be a very plain Man and had a very plain House, which much pleased me. By Profession I think, he is a <HI>Seventh-Day Baptist</HI>; he is a Man of good Report as to his Conduct and Dealing with the World. After a short Visit I returned to take my Leave of Mr. <HI>Honeyman,</HI> and to fetch my Friends, who were at his House, waiting for me. We then went to the House of Mr. <HI>Bourse,</HI> who first spake to me when coming out of Church. The House was soon filled with Company. I expounded and prayed with them for about an Hour, and then retired to a Lodging the LORD in his good Providence had provided for me. The blessed JESUS was pleased sweetly to manifest himself to my Soul. A Consi∣deration of his distinguishing, repeated

<P><HI>Monday, Sept.</HI> 15. Breakfasted this Morning with old Mr. <HI>Clap,</HI> and was much edified by his Conversation. I could not but think, whilst at his Table, that I was sitting with one of the Patri∣archs. He is full of Days, a Batchelor, and has been a Minister of a Congrega∣tion in <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> upwards of Forty Years. People of all Denominations, I find, respect him. He abounds in good Works, gives all away, and is wonder∣fully tender of little Children: Many of them, of different Persuasions, come to be instructed by him. Whenever he dies, I am persuaded, with good old <HI>Simeon,</HI> he will be enabled to say, <HI>LORD, now lettest thou thy Servant depart in Peace.</HI> At Ten in the Morning and Three in the After∣noon, according to Appointment, I read Prayers and preached in the Church: 'Tis very commodious, and, I believe, will contain 3000 People.

End</HI> of <HI>Long-Island.</HI> I sent for him, and found he was the Man. My Heart re∣joiced. We walked out and took sweet Council together; and, amongst other Things, he told me, That he came to <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> under a full Conviction that he should see me there, and had been waiting for me Eight Days: For, he said, these Words were mightily impressed up∣on his Heart.
<Q>Is not <HI>Aaron</HI> the <HI>Levit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> thy Brother? I know that he can speak well; and also, behold he cometh forth to meet thee, and when he seeth thee he will be glad in his Heart. And I will be with thy Mouth and with his Mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.</Q>
What render'd this more rema<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kable, is, I had no Intention of failing into <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> till about Three Days before I left <HI>Carolina</HI>; and also, I had a great Desire to put in, if I could, at the <HI>East End</HI> of <HI>Long-Island,</HI> to see this very Person, whom the Great GOD now brought unto me. <HI>LORD, accept our Thanks, sanctify our Meeting, and teach us both what we shall do, for thy own Name's Sake.</HI> After a long Conference, we took leave of each other for the present; but agreed, that we should now be Compani∣ons in Travel, till the LORD should make our Way more plain. In the Evening I

went to venerable Mr. <HI>Clapp</HI>'s and ex∣horted and prayed with a great Multitude, who not only crowded into the House, but thronged every Way about it..

<P><HI>Tuesday, Sept,</HI> 16. Perceived my self a little low in the Morning; but was enabled to read Prayers and preach with much Flame, Clearness and Power, to still grea∣ter Auditors than Yesterday. It being Assembly - Time, the Gentlemen ad∣journed in order to attend the Service: And several Invitations were given me to come to other adjacent Places. The People were exceedingly attentive, Tears trickled down their Cheeks; and so far prevailed with me by their Im∣portunity, that, by the Divine Permis∣sion, I promis'd to call on them in my Return from <HI>Boston.</HI> When I came home to my Lodgings, the Woman of the House saluted me with, <HI>Blessed art thou of the LORD.</HI> I looked round to see the Reason of such a Salutation, and on the Couch there lay a young Woman. After a little Conversation, I found she had had a gra∣cious

Discovery of the <HI>LORD</HI> JESUS made to her Soul, when I was speaking those Words, <HI>Come see a Man that told me all Things that ever I did.</HI> She said she had often grieved the Spirit of GOD; but now she believed the LORD was calling her home effectually. The Word, added she came with such Power, that I was obliged to go out of the Church, otherwise I must have disturbed the Congregation. When I came from Home, contrary to my Mother's Inclination, I insisted, I knew not why, on staying at <HI>Newport</HI> six Weeks: She would have me stay only a Month; but at last consented for me to stay my own Time. To-morrow, says she, is the last Day of the Six Weeks; <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Oh the Goodness of GOD in sending you just now, before my Time was out!</HI> or Words to that Effect. Afterwards one or two more came under deep Convictions, crying out, in the Bitterness of their Souls, after the <HI>LORD</HI> JESUS. I prayed with each of them, and exhorted them not to rest till they found Rest in JESUS CHRIST. In the Evening I went, as I thought, privately, to a Friend's House; but the People were so eager after the Word, that in a short time, I believe, more than a thousand were be∣fore the Door, besides those that were within, and filled every Room in the
<PB N="57" REF="004846_0056_100E00FEA7840338"/>
House: I therefore stood upon the Thres∣hold, and spoke for near an Hour on these Words,
<Q>Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after Righteousness, for they shall be filled.</Q>
Blessed be GOD it was a very solemn Meeting. Being Night I could not see how the Hearers were affec∣ted; but the LORD assisted me in Speak∣ing. <HI>Glory be to his great Name!</HI> Before I retired to Bed, I went and took my Leave of Mr. <HI>Honyman</HI>; and had some close Talk with him about the <HI>New-Birth.</HI> The LORD give him an experimental Know∣ledge of it! He was very civil, and would have had me staid with him longer; but being to go on a Journey on the Morrow, after we had conversed about half an Hour, I took my Leave. At my Return to my Lodgings good old Mr. <HI>Clapp</HI> went with me in a Room, and gave me something for my <HI>Orphans,</HI> and spoke many affectionate Things to me: Altho' very old, yet he followed me from one end of the Town to the other; so that People said, I had made Mr. <HI>Clapp</HI> young again. <HI>Oh what a Crown of Glory is the hoary Head when found in the Way of Righteousness!</HI> He was exceeding desirous of my Coming to <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> again; which I promised to do by the Di∣vine Permission: For <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> seems to be a Place where much good may be

I find they are sadly divid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> amongst themselves as to outward Things. I think there are no less than four different Congregations of of <HI>Baptists,</HI> two of the <HI>Independents,</HI> and one of the <HI>Quakers</HI> Persuasion. Dean <HI>Berkly's</HI> Name is had in much Respect a∣mongst them. The establish'd Church is in good Order as to Externals: But many of the Head-Members, I soon found, were exceeding great Bigots; they seem'd very fearful least I should preach in Mr. <HI>Clapp's</HI> Meeting-House, and glorified much in my bringing the good old Man to Church. Nor is there less Bigotry, as far as I could find, amongst those of other Communions: All, I fear, place the Kingdom of GOD too much in Meats and Drinks; and have an ill Name abroad for Running of Goods. One day, when I said in my Sermon,
<Q>What will become of you who cheat the King of his Taxes?</Q>
the whole Congregation seemed surpriz'd, and looked on one another as though they should say, We are guilty. LORD <HI>JESUS give them to know thee and the Power of thy Resurrec∣tion, and teach them to render unto</HI> Caesar

When we were within four Miles of the Town, the Governor's Son, and several other Gentlemen, and one or two-Ministers, waited at a Gentleman's House to give me the Meeting. They re∣ceived me with great Gladness, and told me many more would have come, had not a large Funeral been in the Town, or if there had been more certain Notice of my Arriving. This rejoiced me: For I think I can stand any Thing better than this: It favours too much of human Gran∣deur: But I must be tried every Way. The LORD be my Helper.

Was visited by se∣veral Gentlemen and Ministers; and went to the Governor's with <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>Willard,</HI> Se∣cretary of the Province, a Man fearing God, and with whom (tho' before un∣known in Person) I have corresponded for some Time. The Governor received me with the utmost Respect. He seemed to savour the Things which were of GOD, and desired me to come and see him as often as I could. At eleven I went to publick Worship at the <HI>Church of England</HI>; and afterwards waited on the Commissary home, who read Prayers. He received me very courteously, and it being a Day whereon the Clergy of the established Church met, I had Opportunity of con∣versing with five of them together. I think one of them first began witb me fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="62" REF="004846_0061_100E0108541A7430"/>
calling that <HI>Tennent,</HI> and his Brethren, faithful Ministers of JESUS CHRIST. I answer'd, I believed they were. They then questioned me about the Validity of <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Ordination. I replied, I be∣lieved it was valid. They then urged a∣gainst me a Passage in my first Journal, where I said that a <HI>Baptist</HI> Minister at <HI>Deal</HI> did not give me a satisfactory Answer con∣cerning his Mission: I answered, perhaps my Sentiments were altered. And is Mr. <HI>Wesley</HI> altered in his Sentiments too, said one; for he was very strenuous for the Church, and against all other Forms of Government, when he was at <HI>Boston.</HI> I answered, he was then a great Bigot; but GOD had since enlarged his Heart, and, I believed, he was like minded with me, as to this Particular. I then urged, that a catholick Spirit was best; and that a <HI>Baptist</HI> Minister had communicated with me lately at <HI>Savannah.</HI> And, I suppose, says another Clergyman, you would do him as good a Turn and communicate with him. I answered, Yes. I then urged, that it was best to preach up the New-Birth, and the Power of Godliness; and not to insist so much on the Form, for People would never be brought to one Mind as to that; nor did JESUS CHRIST ever intend it. Yes, but says Dr. <HI>Cutler,</HI>
<PB N="63" REF="004846_0062_100E010A1017A8D0"/>
He did. How do prove it? Why says he, our LORD prayed that all might be one, even as thou, Father and I are one. I replied, that was spoken of the inward Union of the Souls of Believers with JESUS CHRIST, and not of the outward Church. That cannot be, says Dr. <HI>Cutler</HI>; for how then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould it be said, that the World might know, that thou hast sent me? He then (taking it for granted, that the <HI>Church of England</HI> was the only true apostolical Church) drew a Parallel between the <HI>Jewish</HI> and our Church, urging how GOD required all Things to be made according to the Pattern given on the Mount. I an∣swered, before the Parallel could be just, it must be proved that every Thing enjoined in our Church was as much a Divine In∣stitution as any Rite or Ceremony under the <HI>Jewish</HI> Dispensation. I added farther, that I saw regenerate Souls among the <HI>Baptist,</HI> among the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> among the <HI>Independents,</HI> and among the Church-Folks: All Children of GOD, and yet all born again in a different Way of Wor∣ship; and who then can tell which is the most Evangelical? What, says the Com∣missary, can you see Regeneration with your Eyes? or something to that Purpose. Soon after we began to talk of the Righ∣teousness of CHRIST; and the Commis∣sary
<PB N="64" REF="004846_0063_100E010C4E701F08"/>
said CHRIST was to make up the Defects of our Righteousness. I asked him if Conversion was not Instantaneous? He was unwilling to confess it; but having just before baptized an Infant at publick Worship, I asked him whether he believed that very Instant in which he sprinkled the Child with Water, the Holy Ghost f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll upon the Child? He answered, Yes. Then says I, according to your own Prin∣ciples Regeneration is Instantaneous; and since you will judge of the New-Birth by the Fruits, pray watch that Child, and see if it brings forth the Fruits of the Spirit. I also said, that if every Child was really born again in Baptism, then every baptized Infant would be saved: And so they are, says Dr. <HI>Cutler.</HI> How do you prove that? Why, says he, the Rubrick says, that all Infants dying after Baptism, before they commit actual Sin are undoubtedly saved. I asked what Text of Scripture there was to prove it. Here, says he, (holding a Prayer Book in his Hand) the Church says so. We then just hinted at Pre∣destination. I said, I subscribed to the 17th Article of the Church in its plain literal Sense with all my Heart. We then talked a little about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ally falling away from Grace. I said, a true of Child of GOD, tho' he might fall <HI>foully</HI> yet could never
<PB N="65" REF="004846_0064_100E010E79B81B98"/>
fall <HI>finally.</HI> But, says he, the Article says Men may fall away from Grace given. But then, says I, observe what follows, and by the Grace of GOD they may rise again▪ Several other Things, of less Consequence, passed between us; but being engaged to dine at my Lodging, and finding how in∣consistent they were, I took my Leave, resolving they should not have the Oppor∣tunity of denying me their Pulpits. How∣ever, they treated me with more Civility than any Set of our own Clergymen have done a long while. The Commissary very kindly urged me to dine with them; but being pre-engaged, I went to my Lodging; and in the Afternoon preached to about 4000 People in Dr. <HI>Coleman</HI>'s Meeting-House; and, as afterwards I was told by several, with great Success. In the Even-I exhorted and prayed with as many as came to my Lodging, and inwardly re∣joiced at the Prospect. there was of bringing many Souls in <HI>Boston</HI> to the saving Know∣ledge of the LORD JESUS CHRIST. <HI>Grant this, O Father, for thy dear Son's sake.</HI> Amen.</P>

giving me an Account of the Suc∣cess of the Gospel, tho' was a little cast down, to find some <HI>English</HI> Friends had thrown aside the Use of Means, and others were disputing for <HI>sinless Perfection,</HI> and <HI>universal Redemption.</HI> I know of no such Thing asserted in the Gospel, if explain'd aright. <HI>LORD, do thou cause even this to work for Good, and give me Grace to oppose such Errors, without Respect to Persons, but with Meekness, Humility and Love.</HI> Amen, LORD JESUS, Amen <HI>and</HI> Amen.</P>
<P>Preach'd in the Morning with much Freedom and Power, to about 6000 Hear∣ers, in Dr. <HI>Sewal</HI>'s Meeting; afterwards on the Common, to about 8000; and a∣gain at Night, to a thronged Company at my own Lodgings; and then spent the Remainder of the Evening with a few choice Friends, in preparing for the Sab∣bath. <HI>Oh that it may be a Day of heaven∣ly Rest sacred to divine Love!

Din' with his Collegue Mr. <HI>Cooper,</HI> and preach'd in the Afternoon to a very throng'd Audito∣ry, and with great and visible Effects, at Mr. <HI>Foxcroft</HI>'s Meeting; immediately af∣ter on the Common, to about 15,000,

and again at my Lodging, as usual, to a greater Company than before. Some afterwards came up into my Room. I felt much of the divine Presence in my own Soul, and tho' hoarse, was enabled to speak with much Power, and could have spoke, I believe, till Midnight. To see the People so willing to hear makes me forget myself. <HI>Oh that it may be my Sleep, my Meat and Drink, to do the Will of my heavenly Father! Oh that all who come to hear the Word, may take the Kingdom of GOD by force!</HI> Amen <HI>and</HI> Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Monday, Sept.</HI> 22. Preached in the Morning, at Mr. <HI>Webb</HI>'s Meeting-House, to about 6000 Hearers in the House, be∣sides great Numbers standing about the Doors. The Presence of the LORD was amongst them. Look where I would a∣round me, visible Impressions were made upon the Auditory. Most wept for a con∣siderable Time. Some time after I re∣ceiv'd a Letter, wherein were these Words.</P>
<P><HI>But what I must give the Preference to, was that gracious Season at the</HI> New North, <HI>the Monday following, where there was more of the Presence of GOD thro' the whole of the Ministration than ever I had known at one Time thro' the whole Course of my Life. Justly might it have been said of that Place,
<PB N="68" REF="004846_0067_100E0113E128C118"/>
it was no other than the House of GOD and the Gate of Heaven. O how dreadfu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> was the Place! and yet, O how delightful! The LORD JESUS seem'd to be visibly walking in that his golden Candlestick, to try some of the many Thousands that were th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> present. But O! how few were prepared for so holy an Inquisition? I am sure I know one who could not but tremble at the Tho'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of it, and who indeed could help crying out,</HI> Wo is me, for I am undone, because I am a Man of unclean Lips; for mine Eyes have seen the King, the LORD of Hosts. <HI>Indeed, my own Soul was so deeply abused and overwhelm'd with such unusual Melt∣ings, that I could have been glad of some pri∣vate Corner in that House, to pour out my Soul without Disturbance to the Audience.</HI> The Spirit of GOD <HI>indeed, seem'd</HI> move∣ing upon the Face of the Waters <HI>at that Time; and who knows, but that, to a great many Souls, GOD was pleased to say,</HI> Let there be Light, and there was Light.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon I went to preach at Mr. <HI>Chickly</HI>'s Meeting-House; but GOD was pleased to humble us by a very awful Providence: For, when the Meeting-House was filled with People, tho' there was no real Danger, on a sudden the Peo∣ple were all in an Uproar, and so unac∣countably
<PB N="69" REF="004846_0068_100E01174B7AE378"/>
surprized, that some threw themselves out of the Window, others threw themselves out of the Gallery; and others trampled upon one another, so that some were actually killed, and others dan∣gerously wounded. I happen'd to come in the Midst of the Uproar, and saw two or three lying on the Ground in a pitia∣ble Condition. GOD was pleased to give me Presence of Mind, so that I gave No∣tice, I would immediately preach on the Common. The Weather was wet, but about 8000 followed into the Field, to whom I preached from these. Words,
<Q>— Go out into the Highways and Hedges, and compel them to come in.</Q>
I endeavoured, as GOD enabled me, to improve what had befallen us; and tho' <HI>Satan</HI> in this has bruised our Heel, yet I doubt not, but even this will be a Means of bruising his accursed Head. <HI>LORD, thy Judgments are like the great Deep! Thy Footsteps are not known, Just and ho∣ly art thou, O King of Saints!</HI></P>
<P>In the Evening perceived myself weak in Body, so that I could not say much at the House where I supped; but GOD by his blessed Spirit greatly refreshed and comforted my Soul. <HI>Blessed be GOD,</HI> I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind what our SAVIOUR says, exceeding true. <HI>He that believeth on me as the Scrip∣ture
<PB N="70" REF="004846_0069_100E0118D3093310"/>
has spoken, out of his Belly shall flow Rivers of living Water.</HI> I drink of GOD's Pleasures as out of a River. <HI>Oh that all were made Partakers of this living Water. They would never thirst after the deadly Pleasures of this lower World.</HI></P>

It is scarce as big as one of our least Colleges in <HI>Oxford</HI>; and as far as I could gather from some, who well knew the State of it, not far superior to our Universities in Piety and true Godliness.

<Q>We are not as many who corrupt the Word of GOD, &amp;c</Q>
— In the Con∣clusion of my Sermon I made a close Ap∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ication to Tutors and Students. A great Number of neighbouring Ministers at∣tended, as indeed they do at all other

Times; and GOD gave me great Free∣dom and Boldness of Speech. The Pre∣sident of the College and Minister of the Parish treated me very civilly. In the Afternoon I preach'd again in the College Yard, without particular Application to the Students. I believe there were 7000 Hearers. The holy Spirit melted many Hearts. The Word was attended with a manifest Power, and a Minister wrote me Word soon after, that he believed one of his Daughters was savingly wrought upon at that Time. <HI>LORD, add daily to thy Church such as shall be saved!</HI></P>
<P>Paid my Respects to the Lieutenant Governor who lives at <HI>Cambridge</HI>; re∣turn'd in the Evening to <HI>Boston,</HI> and ex∣horted and prayed with many People who waited <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound the Door for a spiritual Morsel.

<P><HI>Thursday, Sept.</HI> 25. Preach'd the week∣ly Lecture at Mr. <HI>Foxcroft</HI>'s Meeting-House; but was so oppressed with such▪ Sense of my bafe Ingratitude to my dearest SAVIOUR, that Satan would fain have tempted me to hold my Tongue, and not invite poor Sinners to JESUS CHRIST, because I was so great a Sinner myself.
<PB N="73" REF="004846_0072_100E011E0AA0A460"/>
But GOD enabled me to withstand the Temptation; and since JESUS CHRIST had shewn such Mercy to, and did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot withdraw his holy Spirit from me▪ the Chief of Sinners, I was enabled the more feelingly to talk of his Love; and after∣wards found, that one Stranger in particu∣lar was, in all Probability, effectually con∣victed by that Morning's Sermon. After publick Worship I went, at his Excellen∣cy's Invitation, and din'd with the Go∣vernor. Most of the Ministers of the Town were invited with me. Before Dinner the Governor sent for me up in∣to his Chamber. He wept, wished me good Luck in the Name of the LORD, and recommended himself, Ministers and People to my Prayers. Immediately af∣ter Dinner, at the Governor's Motion, I prayed explicitly for them all. Went in his Coach to the End of the Town; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such a Sense of my Vileness upon my Soul, that I wondred People did not stone me. Cross'd a Ferry, and preach'd at <HI>Charlestown,</HI> a Town lying on the North Side of <HI>Boston.</HI> The Meeting-House was very capacious and quite filled: A graci∣ous Melting was discernable through the whole Congregation; and I perceived much Freedom and Sweetness in my own Soul, tho' the Damp I felt in the Morn∣ing

<P>In the Evening I exhorted and prayed as usual at my Lodging, and, <HI>blessed be GOD,</HI> I found a great Alteration in the Hearers.

when and where it li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eth. After Dinner rode in Company with many to <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> a large Town about Fourteen Miles from <HI>Hampton.</HI> Got thither in a∣bout an Hour and an half. Preach'd to a Polite Auditory, but so very uncon∣cerned that I began to question whether I had been speaking to rational or brute Creatures. Seeing no immediate Effects of the Word preach'd, I was a little de∣jected; but GOD, to comfort my Heart, sent one young Man, crying out in great Anguish of Spirit, <HI>What shall I do to be saved? — Oh how does GOD pity the Weakness of his Children! Why wast thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>east down O my Soul!</HI> — Crossed a Fer∣ry immediately after Sermon, and went ever a very stony Way to <HI>York,</HI> a Town Thirteen Miles, round the Ferry, distant from <HI>Portsmouth.</HI> Hither I came to see one Mr. <HI>Moody,</HI> a worthy, plain and pow∣erful Minister of JESUS CHRIST, tho' now much impaired by old Age. He has l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed by Faith for many Years, would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e no settled Salary, and has be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> much despised by the Haters, and as much re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pected by the true Lovers of the blessed JESUS.

Some of our Fellow-Travellers lost their Way, but came to us some Time after our Arrival at <HI>York.</HI> Here we supt and prayed very comfortably together. The Air agreed mightily with my Con∣stitution. As I came along I was sur∣prized to see such Improvements made in the Space of an Hundred Years, and could not but fancy myself in <HI>Old-England.</HI> Surely GOD is a GOD keeping Cove∣nant.

Mr. <HI>Moody</HI> ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Son, a Minister, who was once full of Faith and Joy in the Holy Ghost, and walked in the Light of GOD's Countenance, and made a full Proof of his Ministry: But for these Two Years last past has walked in Darkness and saw no Light. He has an inexpressible Gloo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> myness upon his Soul, and cannot apply any of the Promises to himself. I was inform'd that he was at Meeting, but dared not see me. I was assisted to pray for him, and so much the more earnestly, not knowing but his Case may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hereafter. <HI>LORD, let me not be high-minded, but fear. Into thy Hands I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣mend my Spirit.

both, Times, especially in the Morning, JESUS CHRIST manifested forth his Glory. Many Hearts melted within them, and I think I never was so drawn out to pray for and invite little Children to JESUS CHRIST as I was that Morning. A little before I had heard of a Child who was taken sick just after it had heard me preach, and said, He would go to Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s GOD, and died in a short Time. This encouraged me to speak to the little ones. But Oh how were the old People affected! When I said, <HI>Little Children, if your Parents will not come to</HI> CHRST, <HI>do you come and go to Heaven without them.</HI> There seem'd to be but few dry Eyes, look where I would.

<P><HI>Thursday, Oct.</HI> 9. Have been applied to, this and every Morning since my Re∣turn, by many Souls under deep Distress; and was only grieved, that I could not have more Time with them. Preach'd this Morning the Publick Lecture at Dr. <HI>Sewal</HI>'s Meeting-House, which was very muc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> crowded. When I left my Lodg∣ings I had fixed on and folded down a particular Text, but when I came near the Meeting-House I found it much im∣pressed upon my Heart, that I should preach upon our LORD's Conference with <HI>Nicodemus</HI>: I acquainted a Friend with it. When I came into the Pulpit I saw a great Number of Ministers sitting around and before me. And when I came to these Words, <HI>Art thou a Master of</HI> Israel <HI>and knowest not these Things?</HI> the LORD enabled me to open my Mouth boldly against unconverted Ministers, to caution Tutors to take Care of their Pu∣pils, and also to advise Ministers part<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣larly to examine into the Experiences of Candidates for Ordination: For I am ve∣rily persuaded, the Generality of Preachers talk of an <HI>unknown unfelt</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. And
<PB N="91" REF="004846_0090_100E01441B8B0A68"/>
the Reason why Congregations have been so dead, is, because they have had dead Men preaching to them. <HI>Oh that the LORD may quicken and revive them for his own Name sake!</HI> For how can dead Men beget living Children? Its true <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣deed, GOD may convert People by the Devil if he pleases, and so he may by un∣converted Ministers: But I believe he seldom makes use of either of them for this Purpose. No! the LORD will chuse Vessels made meet by the Operations of the blessed Spirit for this sacred Use. And as for my own Part, I would not lay Hands on an unconverted Man for Ten Thousand Worlds. Unspeakable Free∣dom GOD gave me while treating on this Head. After Sermon I din'd with tho. Governor, who seem'd more kindly affec∣ted than ever, and particularly told one of the Ministers, who has lately began to preach <HI>Extempore,</HI> That he was very glad he had found out a Way to save his Eyes. <HI>Oh that others would follow him! I believe they would find the</HI> LORD <HI>ready to help and assist them.</HI> In the Afternoon I preached on the Common to about 15000 People, and collected for the <HI>Orphan-House</HI> upwards of 200<HI>l.</HI> Just as I had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my Sermon, a Ticket was put <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> wherein I was desired to pray

for a Person just entered upon the Mi∣nistry; but under Apprehensions that he was not converted; GOD enabled me to pray for him with my whole Heart; and I hope that Ticket will teach many o∣thers, not to run before they can give an Account of their Conversion. If they do, they offer GOD strange Fire. Went to the Funeral of one belonging to the Council; but do not like the Custom at <HI>Boston,</HI> of not speaking at the Grave. When can Ministers Prayers and Exhor∣tations be more suitable, than when the Corps before will silently as it were assist them, and with a Kind of Dumb Orato∣ry, bid <HI>the Spectators consider their latter End.</HI> When the Funeral was over, I went as privately as possible to the Alms-House, and enlarged on these Words, <HI>The Poor receive the Gospel,</HI> for near half an Hour. Then I went to the Work-House, where I prayed with and exhorted a great Number of People who crowded after me, besides those belonging to the House, for an Hour more; then, hearing there was a considerable Number waiting for me at my Lodging (tho' some cried out, <HI>spare thyself</HI>) God strengthen'd me to go and g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve them a spiritual Morsel, and then I went and eat Bread comfortably at a Friend's House, whither I was invited, and

soon after retired to my Rest. <HI>Oh how sweet is Sleep after working for</HI> JESUS! <HI>LORD strengthen me yet a little longer, and then let me sleep in thee never to awake in this vain World again!

One little Girl came to me, about Eight Years old, under deep Convictions: She, as her Friends told me, had been wrestling for CHRIST, and, whilst she was wrestling, it came to her Mind, that JESUS being in an Agony, prayed yet so much the more earnestly, and that an Angel was sent from Heaven to strengthen him; this encouraged her to persevere, and her Soul soon received some Comfort.

I have not heard of any re∣markable Stir in it for these many Years. Ministers and People are obliged to con∣fess, that the Love of many is waxed cold. Both, for the Generality, seem'd too much conform'd to the World. There's much of the Pride of Life to be seen in their Assemblies. Jewels, Patches and gay Apparel are commonly worn by the female Sex. Little Boys and Girls I ob∣served commonly dressed up in the Pride of Life; and the little Infants that were brought to Baptism, were wrapped in such fine Things, and so much Pains ta∣ken to dress them, that one would think, they were brought thither to be <HI>initiated into</HI> rather than <HI>renounce</HI> the Pomps and Vanities of this wiched World.

One Thing <HI>Bos∣ton</HI> is remarkable for, The external Ob∣servation of the <HI>Sabbath.</HI> Men in Civil Offices have a Regard for Religion.

I never saw so little Scoffing, never had so little Opposi∣tion: But one might easily foresee, much Opposition will hereafter arise, when I come to be more particular in my Appli∣cation to particular Persons: For I fear many, many rest in a Head-Knowledge, are close Pharisees, having only a Name to live. It must needs be so, when the Po∣wer of Godliness is dwindled away, and the Form only of Religion is become fashion∣able amongst a People.

Oh that the LORD may make them a flaming Fire! Come LORD JE∣SUS, come quickly.</HI> Amen <HI>and</HI> Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, Oct.</HI> 26. Preached both Morn∣ing and Evening to much larger Congre∣gations than before, and in the Afternoon observed an especial Presence of GOD in the Assembly. Many, I believe, were comforted and quicken'd by the Holy. Ghost. The People of GOD sent me Word that they were much revived; and one came and told me, these Words were lately pressed upon her Heart, <HI>The Winter is gone, the Spring is at Hand, the Voice of the Turtle is heard in the Land.</HI> Indeed I believe this will be an acceptable Year of the LORD. Before Evening Service, the following Note was put into my Hands, by one who came to me a Day or two ago, some Miles off, under great Dis∣tress,

and tho' weak in Body could not but follow after me. <HI>One self-righteous</HI> Pharisee <HI>resting in Duties, who hath a ra∣tional Belief of his damned Estate, and that he hath never felt the Pangs of the</HI> New-Birth, <HI>desires Prayers to your GOD, that hath said,</HI> “Ye must be born again,” After Sermon waited on the Governor, an aged, grave old Gentleman, well reported of by good Men. I observed him to be much affected under the Word. When I came in, he said, <HI>I am glad to see you, and</HI> heartily <HI>glad to hear you.</HI> But his Heart was so full, that he could not speak much. The T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ars trickled down his aged Cheeks like Drops of Rain, <HI>He was thankful to GOD,</HI> he said, <HI>for such Refreshings in the Way to our Rest. Food does us good,</HI> added he, <HI>when we eat it with an Appetite.</HI> And in∣deed I believe, he had fed upon the Word. <HI>The LORD support him when his Strength <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aileth, and bring his grey Hairs with Com∣fort to the Grave!</HI> In the Evening I ex∣pounded at my Lodging to a great Num∣ber of People, and collected near <HI>Forty Pounds</HI> for the <HI>Orphans.</HI> My Soul was much refreshed, to hear how the Children of GOD were revived by the Word preached: And nothing confirms me more, that I have been taught of GOD and preach the Truth as it is in JESUS,

than to find our LORD's dear and old Disciples feeling the Power of the Word wherever I go, and saying, it agrees with their Experiences. <HI>My Sheep hear my Voice,</HI> says our dear Redeemer, <HI>a Stranger will they not hear.</HI> About Eight at Night. we left <HI>New-Haven.</HI> The Moon shone bright, and after we had rode three Miles, we called at a House. which, as Mr. <HI>Wheelock,</HI> a faithful Minister of JESUS CHRIST, told me before, was full of GOD. I think they tell me the Mother and Three Daughters were converted Per∣sons. As soon as I came into the House the Spirit of the LORD came upon me. GOD gave me to wrestle with him, and and my Friends said, at departing, they were never in such a House before. <HI>Oh it was a sweet Time indeed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> GOD made his Power to be felt and known.</HI> After I had given a Word of Exhortation, that they would adorn the Gospel of our LORD in all Things, we went forward on our Journey, and got to <HI>Milford,</HI> Ten Miles from <HI>New-Haven,</HI> about Ten a Clock at Night. <HI>The LORD's Name be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raised, from the rising up of the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he going down of the same</HI> .

<P><HI>Monday, Oct.</HI> 27. Preach'd this Morn∣ing at <HI>Milford,</HI> and I think with as much Clearness, Freedom and Power as I have for a long Season. The Presence of GOD was much in the Assembly, which was large. Many Ministers were present, and they could not help glorifying GOD much on my Behalf. Dear Mr. <HI>Mills,</HI> who came again to meet me this Morn∣ing, was much affected; and as I was riding out of Town, a godly Gentleman met me, and with Tears in his Eyes, at length out of the Abundance of his Heart, said, <HI>I never saw GOD's Presence in the Sanctuary on this wise before. I have ex∣perienced the Words you spoke; but never heard them so well cleared up, nor felt them so powerfully set home upon my Soul. It has been a blessed Time to my Soul</HI>; or Words to that Effect. In the Afternoon I preached at <HI>Stra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ford,</HI> Four Miles from <HI>Milford,</HI> but was not so much assisted as in the Morning. Both Places, especially the latter, I found, were ill reported of, for their leaning too much towards <HI>Arminian</HI> Prin∣ciples. <HI>O LORD, convince them of the Rottenness of such a Foundation, and bring them to know the Truth as it is in</HI> JESUS.</P>

<P><HI>Tuesday, Octob.</HI> 28. Got to <HI>Fairfield,</HI> Eight Miles from <HI>Stratford,</HI> about Ten last Night. The Weather was very cold, having snowed a great Part of the Afternoon, but the LORD brought us in Safety. Preached to a considerable large Congregation in the Morning, and found myself assisted very much in my Prayer after Sermon, I scarce knew how to leave off. In the Afternoon. at <HI>Norwalk,</HI> Twelve Miles from <HI>Fairfield,</HI> I was re∣strain'd much both in Prayer and Preach∣ing. It rained much, so that we had not
a large Congregation. However, some few, I observed, were affected. I believe my LORD never lets me preach in vain. <HI>Grant this, O GOD, for thy own Name Sake.</HI></P>

Night's Trial. Notwithstanding, before I had preached half an Hour, the blessed Spirit began to move on the Hearers Hearts in a very awful Manner; young, and especially many old People were sur∣prizingly affected, so that I thought they would have cried out. At Dinner the Spirit of the LORD came upon me again, and enabled me to speak with such Vigour against sending unconverted Persons into the Ministry, that two Ministers with Tears in their Eyes, publickly confessed, they had laid Hands on young Men with∣out so much as asking them, <HI>Whether they were born again of GOD, or not?</HI> After Dinner, finding my Heart much enlarged, I prayed, and with such Power, that most in the Room were put under Concern; and one old Minister was so deeply con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cted, that calling Mr. <HI>Noble</HI> and me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, with great Difficulty (because of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>) he desired our prayers: <HI>For, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, I have been a Scholar and have p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>each'd the Doctrines of Grace for a long T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t I believe I have never felt the Power of them in my own Soul. — Oh that all unconverted Ministers were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> make the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Confession!</HI> I wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> affected wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> his Ingenuity, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, by Prayer, earnestly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him to GOD, I took Horse, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

exceedingly in Spirit, to see how our LORD was getting himself the Victory, in a Place where Mr. <HI>Davenport,</HI> a Na∣tive of <HI>Stanford,</HI> a dear Minister of the blessed JESUS, had been slighted and de∣spised. <HI>A Prophet is not without Honour, save in his own Country and his Father's House.</HI></P>
<P>But here I think it proper to set up my <HI>Ebenezer,</HI> and before I enter into the Pro∣vince of <HI>New-York,</HI> to give GOD Thanks for sending me into <HI>New England.</HI> I have now had an Opportunity of seeing the greatest and the most populous Parts of it; and take all together, it certainly, on
many Accounts, exceeds all other Provin∣ces in <HI>America,</HI> and for the Establishment of Religion, perhaps all other Parts of the World. Never, surely, was so large a Spot of Ground settled in such a Manner in so short a Space as a hundred Years.

know CHRIST; yet I cannot see much worldly Advantage to tempt them to take upon them the sacred Function; few Country-Ministers, as I have been inform'd have sufficient allowed them in Money to maintain a Family. GOD has remarka∣bly, in sundry Times, and after divers Manners, poured out his Spirit in several Parts of both Provinces; and it often re∣fresh'd my Soul to hear of the Faith of the good Forefathers who first settled in these Parts. Notwithstanding they had their Fobles, surely they were a Set of righteous Men! They certainly followed our LORD's Rule, sought first the Kingdom of GOD and its Righteousness, and behold all other Things GOD added to them. Their Seed are now blessed in temporal Things especially, and notwithstanding the rising Generation seem to be settled on their Lees, yet, I believe, the LORD has left more than seven Thousand who have not bowed the Knee to <HI>Baal.</HI> The Ministers and People of <HI>Connecticut</HI> seem'd to be more simple and serious than those that live near <HI>Boston,</HI> especially in the Parts where I went. But, I think, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Ministers Preaching, almost 1univer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, by Notes, is a certain Mark they have, in a great Measure, lost the old <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Preaching: For, tho' all are not to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

condemned that use Notes, yet it is a sad Symptom of the Decay of vital Religion, when Reading Sermons becomes fashiona∣ble where extempore Preaching did once almost universally prevail. When the Spirit of Prayer began to be lost, then Forms of Prayer were invented. And, I believe, the same Observation will hold good as to Preaching. As for the Universi∣ties, I believe, it may be said, their Light is now become Darkness, Darkness that may be felt, and is complain'd of by the most godly Ministers. I pray GOD these Fountains may be purified, and send forth pure Streams to water the City of our GOD. The <HI>Church of England</HI> is at a very low Ebb; and, as far as I can find, had People kept their primitive Purity it would scarce have got Footing in <HI>New-England.</HI> I have many Evidences to prove
that most of the Churches have been first set up by immoral Men, and such as would not submit to the Discipline of their Congregation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or were corrupt in the Faith: But I will say no more about the poor <HI>Church of England,</HI> most of her Sons, whether Ministers or People, I fear, hate to be reform'd. As for the Civil Govern∣ment of <HI>New-England,</HI> it seems to be well regulated; and, I think, at opening all their Courts, either the Judge or Minister

begins with Prayer. Family-Worship is, I believe, generally kept up. The Negroes, I think, are better used, in respect both to
Soul and Body, than in any other Province that I have yet seen. In short, I like <HI>New-England</HI> exceeding well, and when a Spirit of Reformation revives, it certain∣ly will prevail more than in other Places, because they are more simple in their Wor∣ship, less corrupt in their Principles, and consequently more easily brought over to the Form of sound Words, into which so many of their pious Ancestors were de∣liver'd. <HI>Send forth, O</HI> LORD, <HI>thy Light and thy Truth, and for thy infinite Mercies sake shew thou hast a peculiar Delight in these habitable Parts of the Earth.</HI> Amen. LORD JESUS, Amen.</P>
