<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>WE are assembled on this joyful anniversay of our public liberty:—liberty obtained at the expence of much blood and treasure; with decency becoming a christian state, we now appear in this sacred place, first to pay our religious ac∣knowledgements to the SUPREME RULER, and to collect some instruction from the oracles of truth: that special pro∣vidence which prevents the worthy reverend brother<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Rev. Dr. Langdon, of Hampton-Falls, confined with a broken bone, but a short time before the general election in this State.</NOTE> ap∣pointed to have led in the public devotions of this day, and a very late call on me to stand in his place, from his Excel∣lency the PRESIDENT and the honorable COUNCIL, must be my apology for the following hasty composition.</P>
<P>LET this honorable COURT then, and this respectable AS∣SEMBLY permit me to expect their kind candor, while I at∣tempt a few important thoughts on this great occasion, sug∣gested by the words of our LORD, recorded in the gospel according to</P>

<BIBL>MATTHEW, xxiv.—45, 46, 47, ver.</BIBL>
<Q>Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his Lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season? blessed is that servant, whom his Lord when he cometh, shall find so doing: Verily I say unto you he shall make him ruler over all his goods.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY RESPECTED HEARERS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AMONG the many metaphors used in sa∣cred scripture, expressive of the duty and subjection we owe to God our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ; that of a servant is perhaps the most frequent. It is used with the highest propriety; for it is just in its self, and adapted to convey ideas of the highest importance to us. For he who made us, he who provides for us, sup∣porting both soul and body in all their noble powers and organs, has surely an unlimitted right to our services. He, who has redeemed us unto God with his own most precious blood, that we might be to him <HI>a peculiar people, zealous of good works,</HI> has the highest claims upon us, and may justly expect we should glorify him in our bodies &amp; in our souls which are the Lords. In a word, he may justly expect, that, in our respective stations and characters, we should yield all ready obedi∣ence
<PB N="5" REF="019705_0005_0FAC9B9363C26758"/>
and subjection to him, who has laid down his precious life for us.</P>
<P>AND indeed, my friends, the true servants of Jesus Christ glory in their character: they esteem it their highest dignity, that they are now no longer servants and slaves, to the prince of the power of this world; nor to their own vile lusts: but that the blessed son of God hath made them free: though other Lords have had dominion over them, yet henceforth they will make mention on∣ly of his name.</P>
<P>SERVANTS must do their masters work, and keep ever in view, as their rule and guide his commands and will: they must do their work with cheerfulness,—with singleness of heart,—and good fidelity; though their master may appoint to some more work, to others less, according to their several abilities; yet all have something on their hands by his appointment of importance to be done. Nor does the subordination of labour∣ers, or that of their work, at all prevent their holding one common title, under their great Lord: they are all his servants, and blessed be his name, if they are faithful, however they may rank among themselves, they shall <HI>all</HI> in the last day,
<PB N="6" REF="019705_0006_0FAC9B9421562248"/>
receive a most gracious reward from their divine master, in the presence of attending angels, and an assembled world.</P>
<P>THE servant mentioned in the text, seems to have been one greatly honored with peculiar ta∣lents and entrustments; he is made ruler over his masters household, his character and post are ap∣plicable, with some special propriety, to <HI>Magis∣trates</HI> and <HI>Ministers.</HI></P>
<P>MAGISTRATES are appointed, by the wise and good providence of heaven, to rule among men, in subordination to, and in immitation of him, "who himself rules the world in righteousness, and judges the people with equity." The holy Apostle Paul accordingly roundly asserts, <HI>that the powers that be, are ordained of God.</HI> They are, in this sense even under the present dispensation, <HI>the Lord's annointed,</HI> appointed by him ministers of God for good. They have in their exalted stations, the solemn oath and charge of God imposed upon them, to regard supremely his honor, to promote the great end of their delegated power, and the <HI>pub∣lic good.</HI> They are commanded to be <HI>just,</HI> to <HI>fear God,</HI> to <HI>hate coveteousness,</HI> and ever to bear in mind that <HI>God is with them in the judgment.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="019705_0007_0FAC9B94E654CE20"/>
THESE are his honored servants in the <HI>State,</HI>—the earthly political household of the Lord: they are appointed to do his work, to promote the hap∣piness of the <HI>Commonwealth,</HI> which is the great end of all political government;—<HI>to give to every one his meat in due season,</HI> and advance, to their utmost, the great designs of God's moral govern∣ment in the world: Happy are these his honored servants, <HI>whom when their Lord cometh, he shall find so doing: Verily I say unto you, he shall make them rulers over all his goods;</HI> their stations shall be marked with distinguished honor in the world of supreme glory.</P>
<P>MINISTERS must consider themselves under the character of <HI>servants</HI> in the church of the liv∣ing God: their work is spiritual, their charge is great, and their account will be most solemn. By the great <HI>head</HI> of the church they are made ru∣lers in his spiritual household, <HI>which is the church of the living God;</HI> they are appointed to this office, not to <HI>Lord it over mens faith,</HI> or consciences; but to be <HI>helpers of their joy;</HI> and to <HI>give to every one his portion of meat in due season.</HI></P>
<P>GREAT wisdom and faithfulness are necessary in ministers, in order to their acquiting them∣selves
<PB N="8" REF="019705_0008_0FAC9B95A1EE0900"/>
to God and their own consciences: though as ministers of that kingdom of their blessed Lord, which is not of this world, they are not to inter∣fere with matters of government, nor assume <HI>lordly titles</HI> over their fellow subjects; yet it must be allowed, they have a most important deposi∣tum committed to them; they have an arduous work on their hands; they have been <HI>charged in the presence of God and the holy angels, to watch for souls as those who must give account;</HI> they are urged to be found faithful in the household of God, by innumerable motives of the highest moment; one only might be thought sufficient; they are the <HI>servants</HI> of mens <HI>souls</HI> for <HI>Christ's sake.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, my respected hearers, while we have pointed out magistrates and ministers as especial∣ly designed in the sacred passage, we are consider∣ing, let none of this assembly consider themselves as wholly disinterested in the subject in hand; for persons of every age, rank and character have something intrusted them by the great Lord of the household; they have some talents to improve for the well-being of the State to which they be∣long; the honor of Christ and the edification of the church.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="019705_0009_0FAC9B9661B72250"/>
WE have all the proper work of <HI>time</HI> assigned us, in whatever posts we are placed. There is something to be done, for ourselves and society.—Something in our power to effect, either by our heads, our hearts, or our hands. We must all <HI>be diligent in business, and fervent in spirit, serv∣ing the Lord.</HI> I say again, time, and all its im∣portant concernments, are talents intrusted us by the great <HI>Lord</HI> of <HI>all;</HI>—and wo unto us, if by indo∣lence, or attention to other things, things compa∣ratively of no importance, we <HI>wrap these talents up in a napkin,</HI> and leave them unimproved.</P>
<P>BUT give me leave to consider, a little more distinctly, the character of wise and faithful ser∣vants, as it is concisely drawn by our Lord in the text.</P>
<P>IT must be supposed then, that they <HI>know</HI> the <HI>duties</HI> of their particular stations; and what <HI>ta∣lents,</HI> are intrusted them for their improvement.</P>
<P>ONE, who is wholly ignorant of his Lord's will; who either cannot, or will not understand the duties, of his particular station; or in what way he ought to serve God and man, cannot be numbered among, either the wise, or the faithful
<PB N="10" REF="019705_0010_0FAC9B97216E3270"/>
servants. The good servants, therefore of our Lord Jesus Christ, will not fail to enquire with diligence, after their master's will; and carefully consider what are the duties, which especially be∣long to that department, he has assigned them: Their language, from time to time, will be, like that of Saul, in his way to Demascus, <HI>Lord, what wouldst thou have me to do?</HI></P>
<P>THE servant in the text, is called a <HI>wise</HI> ser∣vant, not only because it is our highest wisdom to be faithful; but because he was <HI>prudent,</HI> being well instructed in all the duties of his station.</P>
<P>AGAIN, wise servants, will keep in their proper spheres.</P>
<P>THEY will not intermeddle with things which lie out of their line, or above their capacity. <HI>Wherein God hath called them, therein they will abide with God.</HI> They will diligently attend upon the business of their own proper stations; they will consider what are the talents intrusted them; and be concerned to improve those they <HI>have,</HI> not those they <HI>have not.</HI></P>
<P>THE want of this kind of wisdom, has intro∣duced, both into the church and state, great dis∣orders.
<PB N="11" REF="019705_0011_0FAC9B97E182FAC0"/>
Hence have proceeded those violent at∣tacks, on that order of priesthood, which God himself, established in the Jewish oeconomy: Hence the story of <HI>Korah, Dathan, and Abiram;</HI> as you will see at large in <HI>Num.</HI> XVI, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the be∣ginning. Hence also that unhappy king <HI>Uzziah,</HI> who thurst himself into the priest's office, and was struck, by the hand of the Lord, with the plague of leprosy, for his prophane presump∣tion: You will read the account of this memora∣ble event in 2d <HI>Chron.</HI> XXVI. <HI>chap.</HI></P>
<P>NOR has the christian church been free from the sad effects of the same spirit. Many have <HI>run before they were sent:</HI> and those <HI>who kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w not what are the first principles of the oracles of God,</HI> have imagined they were quite equal to the most ar∣duous undertaking;—that they could <HI>stop the mouth of gainsayers,</HI> and <HI>rightly divide the word of truth, giving to every one, his portion in due season.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the State has been as much infested, with this proud and self-advancing spirit, as the church. While modesty, with great abilities, has been contented in her humble station; though in the truth of facts, one of the highest recommen∣dations to public trust; the self-confident assur∣ance, of some ignorant, overbearing persons, ei∣ther
<PB N="12" REF="019705_0012_0FAC9B98A1927798"/>
by the brass in their face, or the gold in their purse, have pushed themselves into places, which they could neither fill with dignity, nor resign without humiliating regret. Hence, the wise king <HI>Solomon,</HI> long since observed a <HI>sore evil under the sun, namely, servants on horse-back, and princes walking by their side.</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN, faithful servants, are supposed to be well acquainted, with the <HI>ends</HI> and <HI>purposes,</HI> to which their talents and entrustments, must be applied. The glory of the great Lord of all, and the happiness of mankind, command their highest attention. They know that God is glo∣rified, when the great purposes of his moral go∣vernment, are answered; these centre in the hap∣piness of mankind. For "the Father of Being is the Father of mercies, a principle of boundless active love; and though infinitely various in ex∣ecution, his design is one, his own glory, or which is evidently the same thing, the happiness of his creatures, is the centre in which all the lines of his government unite. Every thing takes place in the universal system, according as it tends to the accomplishment of this great parental pur∣pose." The duties, therefore of the second table, or what we owe to our fellow servants, will be
<PB N="13" REF="019705_0013_0FAC9B9961D82770"/>
eyed with great attention. The religion of our Divine Master, is most kind and beneficent: The gospel itself is a manifestation of divine love, di∣rected to it's proper object,—the salvation of a ruined world. Every attentive person, must ob∣serve, that it is well adapted to promote, civil and social happiness: For, it inriches the heart with every virtue, which tends to adorn human nature, and to increase the common stock of social hap∣piness. "It forms the wise and prudent parent,—the amiable child,—the affectionate brother,—the generous friend; but above all, the judicious, upright and consistent magistrate; who rises su∣perior, not only to views of personal interest; but what is often more expressive of true great∣ness, the prejudice of party, and the blind impulse of passion; who with the knowledge and govern∣ment of his own heart, is unmoved by the fro∣ward humours of the world around him; and whether they frown or flatter, he remains fixed in his purpose, of promoting their happiness."—Thus faithful servants, influenced by the princi∣ples of our holy religion, will ardently desire, and assiduously endeavor to promote the well-being of all around them; especially of those who are committed to <HI>their</HI> care in their character of ma∣gistrates or ministers. The servant in the text,
<PB N="14" REF="019705_0014_0FAC9B9A229F6358"/>
gave the houshold, their meat in due season: It was his <HI>fidelity in this branch of his character,</HI> his Lord emphasised, and remarked with so much kind respect.</P>
<P>BE assured, my respected friends, faithful ser∣vants are not only acquainted with the duties of their respective stations; and know the ends which should command their highest attention; but they are constantly and conscienciously con∣cerned to discharge these duties, and to answer the end of their appointment, to such particular stations, in the oeconomy of God's moral govern∣ment.</P>
<P>ARE they rulers? They will <HI>rule in the fear of God;</HI> devoting themselves to his honor, <HI>by whom kings reign, and princes decree justice:</HI> they will imi∣tate in some happy measure, though alas! infinite∣ly short of the great original, the wisdom,—the justice,—faithfulness and mercy of the Supreme Ruler, all which glorious perfections shine with resplendent lustre, in his moral government of the world.</P>
<P>ARE they ministers of the gospel? it is their great concern to <HI>obtain mercy of the Lord to be found faithful.</HI> They give themselves wholly to their proper work; <HI>warning every man—and teaching
<PB N="15" REF="019705_0015_0FAC9B9AF7993EF0"/>
every man in all wisdom that they may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>ARE they parents or masters? they are con∣scienciously concerned <HI>to walk in their houses with a perfect heart.</HI> They behave with kindness, gen∣tleness, and fidelity towards those committed to their care and government:—They endeavor to teach them by precepts, and their own examples, the true fear of the Lord. Consider them in any,—in all the dear social connexions of life, you will see them <HI>kind and courteous, tender hearted and pitiful;</HI> endeavouring to exhibit themselves a patern to others, in the full exercise, of all the social virtues and graces of the gospel.</P>
<P>To sum up all in few words; they, who are wise and faithful servants, employ all their abili∣ties, and improve all their opportunities, in their respective stations, for the glory of God, and the welfare of mankind. Their time,—their health,—their dignities,—their substance,—the gifts and graces of the gospel,—and all their advantages, of either doing good to others; or of obtaining essential benefit to themselves: all these are con∣secrated and devoted, to the honor of their great
<PB N="16" REF="019705_0016_0FAC9B9BA27E75A8"/>
Master, by a careful, and faithful improvement of them.</P>
<P>BUT it is more than time, my worthy hearers, that the subject should be particularly addressed to the honorable Court, whose presence has call∣ed me to speak, from this sacred place. May I be permitted, with humble assurance, to address this honorable Court as a collective body of <HI>chris∣tian Magistrates,</HI> assembled, with fixt purpose of heart to promote the honor of the great <HI>Messiah,</HI> and the best interest of this commonwealth?</P>
<P>UNDER this most respectable character, I will hope to consid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> every one of this much respect∣ed body. For, Heaven forbid, that this State, in her infancy, should so far forget her own con∣stitution, that grand palladium of all her liberties, as to suffer infidels and deists to fasten their fal∣con hands on the reins of government; or give a place, in their legislative, judicial, or executive body to any one, who does not hold himself ame∣nable at the tribunal of him <HI>who has a name writ∣ten on his vesture and on his thigh, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Honored Gentlemen,</HI> YOUR dignity,—your duty,—and the most
<PB N="17" REF="019705_0017_0FAC9B9C613914C8"/>
powerful motives to fidelity have been imperfect∣ly hinted in the didactic part of our subject. It is presumed you have listened with an attentive ear, to a subject, in which your public characters so deeply interest you. You have, I trust, alrea∣dy made the application of the practical part to your own hearts.</P>
<P>YOU are called, by the suffrage of free citizens, to be <HI>rulers over God's houshold:</HI> And thus for the voice of the people may, undoubtedly, be consider∣ed as <HI>the voice of God.</HI> Yea, the great master of the houshold himself stiles you Gods. <HI>I said ye are Gods; but ye shall die like men.</HI> Your stations are honorable, as they are important: And while you faithfully discharge the duties, belonging to your several departments, you have just claims of <HI>hon∣or and obedience</HI> on us,—on this whole common∣wealth.</P>
<P>IF, according to your original designation, you are indeed <HI>the ministers of God for good;</HI> if you are wise and faithful, always <HI>seeking the peace of God's people;</HI> if you give to the houshold their meat in due season, by a <HI>just and wise legislation,</HI> and by a <HI>faithful</HI> and <HI>energetic execution</HI> of good laws; then duty, love and gratitude oblige us, to pay you
<PB N="18" REF="019705_0018_0FAC9B9D212CDFC8"/>
high honor and respect. Yea, it is in the code of gospel precepts, enjoined us, not only to <HI>fear God,</HI> but to <HI>honor such civil rulers,</HI> we are com∣manded <HI>to submit ourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake;</HI> and we ought, by the same divine authority, to <HI>render custom, (or tribute,) to whom custom, fear to whom fear, and honor to whom honor is due.</HI> Every citizen therefore, who de∣serves the protection of the laws, so far from cast∣ing any reproach on your character; or weak∣ening your hands, by calumniating insinuations, will show you every mark of dutiful respect; &amp; en∣deavour to strengthen your hands, in the discharge of the duties of your public character.</P>
<P>YOUR duty, and your dignity go hand in hand: They are essentially connected together. The rule and measure is plainly drawn,—drawn by your <HI>own</HI> hands, in the <HI>constitution</HI> of this State, from which you have solemnly <HI>sworn</HI> you will not de∣viate. <HI>This</HI> you will therefore, carefully study in all its branches. You will consider it of great importance, to know, these statutes and ordinan∣ces, that you might not transgress: You will re∣collect that, for this end, the princes of God's an∣cient people, were divinely enjoined, to write out, with their own hands, the Mosaic constitution.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="019705_0019_0FAC9B9DE140E8B0"/>
GIVE me leave, to remind you, that it is the <HI>constitution,</HI> and <HI>constitutional laws,</HI> to which the people have pledged their fidelity and obedience; and not to any body of men, however otherwise respectable. The moment therefore, you should presume to raise yourselves, in political importance, above the constitution, you would forfeit your political dignity; and stand upon the same ground, with the lowest voters in the state. Did I say, upon the same ground? I correct myself: For such voters are supposed to be free, from every charge, of public infidelity: But you would be liable to be called upon, to answer for your un∣faithfulness, at the tribunal of an injured people.</P>
<P>DETERMINED to make this your main guide; you will exert your combined efforts, fully to dis∣charge, that public confidence your fellow citi∣zens, have reposed in you. And surely, you can∣not fail to recollect, that the wise and faithful servant, whom his Lord made ruler over all his houshold, gave them their meat in due season: This was the principal part of his duty! this he faith∣fully discharged. When you consider therefore, yourselves appointed by the same Lord, through the voice of the people, to be rulers over this part of his houshold; and that the very end of this
<PB N="20" REF="019705_0020_0FAC9B9EA16E51B0"/>
appointment, is, that you might have it in your power, to give every member his portion of meat in due season;—this consideration, will surely annihilate every low motive;—every species of party spirit, and selfish views: For these would be likely to draw off your attention, from the pub∣lic emolument, and fix it on your own families, or near connexions. You will reprobate, with the highest indignation, the idea of desecrating the important <HI>depositum</HI> committed to you, to the un∣worthy purposes, of feeding <HI>yourselves</HI> only, and not the whole houshold.</P>
<P>THUS united, and in earnest to promote the public welfare of every part of this State, you will immediately find important business crowding from every quarter, on your heads,—your hearts, your hands: For, the present suffering circum∣stances of the houshold, call aloud for your im∣mediate care.</P>
<P>BUT modest propriety, and a full conviction of my own inability, to lead you through the laberinth of public labors, forbid my making any attempt of the kind.</P>
<P>ONLY, let me observe, the scarcity of a circula∣ting
<PB N="21" REF="019705_0021_0FAC9B9F615B4A98"/>
medium;—the low State of our national credit, and commerce;—the poor multiplying in all our towns;—inattention to the natural sources of our wealth;—<ABBR>viz.</ABBR> agriculture; manufactures: well regulated commerce; and especially that oeco∣nomical prudence, which is essential to the public prosperity of every people; these are subjects, which call aloud for the united wisdom and en∣ergy of this honorable court.</P>
<P>A revision of such acts, as have been supposed, inconsistent with the constitution:—The appoint∣ment of proper persons, to represent you in Con∣gress, persons, possessed of talents adapted to serve in that very important station, and adorned with such a christian character, as you would wish to have exhibited, as a sample of your own christian morality, before other christian nations;—toge∣ther with the appointment to other offices in the State as there may be a call for them;—as also means to reward such as are faithful, without distressing the people;—these undoubtedly are objects, worthy the notice and careful attention, of this respected court.</P>
<P>THE scarcity of men of literary abilities, and the importance in which the rising generation,
<PB N="22" REF="019705_0022_0FAC9BA050093598"/>
are justly held, by all the wise in every nation, especially in infant Sates, will surely turn your paternal eyes on our youth. You will wish to have their young minds, cultivated under the skil∣ful hand of able and religious instructors;—such as are capable, at least, of teaching them the ru∣diments of our own language; and instructing them, by their own examples, in the principles of christian morality. If there are good laws al∣ready enacted on this subject, it is presumed you will endeavor to give more energy to such, as have hitherto, utterly failed of answering their saluta∣ry design.</P>
<P>IN a word, your watchful and compasionate eyes will pervade every part of the houshold: Your hearts will feel for <HI>all:</HI> And your hands of justice,—truth—and goodness will be employed for <HI>all.</HI> And blessed are ye, if when your great Lord calls you from your present distinguished sta∣tions, either by death, or in any other way, you shall be found so doing.</P>
<P>HIS mouth shall bless you, who has all pow∣er of blessing in his hands: And whom he blesses, is blessed indeed. You shall have peace in your own consciences: <HI>the peace of God, which passeth

all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds, through Christ Jesus:</HI> Heavens blessings shall be implored upon you, by all the wise and good: You shall be blessed with more wisdom and grace; and perhaps, with further intrustments: For, to him who thus hath, thus faithfully improves what he hath, we may justly expect more shall be given: Your fellow citizens shall bless you: Yea, children yet unborn, shall have your names transmitted them, with high honor.</P>
<P>BUT above all, your Lord and master in Heaven shall bless you▪ and pronounce, in the great day of his appearing, that happy <HI>euge</HI> on you: <HI>Well done, good and faithful servants, ye have been faith∣ful in a few things, I will make you rulers over many things; enter ye into the joy of your Lord.</HI></P>
<P>To conclude; let this whole assembly be im∣pressed with a deep sense, of the infinite importance of fidelity in their respective ranks. God's eye is ever fixt on us all: As there are none above his controul, so there are none below his notice: We shall all stand together, before the <HI>bar of Christ,</HI> there—solemn thought! there to render up our respective accounts, of the various talents intrusted us; and to be judged according to the

deeds done in the body. <HI>Then</HI> all these distinctions shall be laid aside: <HI>Then</HI> there will be neither <HI>honorable</HI> nor <HI>base,</HI> in any other sense, than as we shall in that important hour, be pronounced ei∣ther <HI>faithful, or unfaithful, righteous</HI> or <HI>wicked.</HI></P>
<P>THEN, all rule and authority, shall be put down: For Christ the great Messiah, <HI>shall reign, till all things are put under his feet.</HI> O, therefore, let us <HI>now</HI> kiss the son, lest he be angry with us, and we perish in that day; <HI>blessed are all they that put their trust in him</HI></P>
