<P>GOOD news from a far Country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov 25. 13, 25. v. Comp.</NOTE> by the hand of a faithful Messenger, is at all times very acceptable. What better news then Salvation for Sinners? What farther Country then Heaven? What more faithful Messenger then the Lord Jesus Christ?</P>

<P>IN which two Verses three or four things are Observable.</P>
<P N="1">1.

THE Place where Christ now began his Publick Ministry;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isai. 9. 1.</NOTE> it was in a remote and obscure part of the Country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 4. 16.</NOTE> even in Galilee. <HI>Thus the People which sat in Dark∣ness, saw great Light: and to them which sat in the region and shadow of Death, Light is sprung up.</HI></P>

<HI>He was Gorified of all.</HI> Besure, all that heard his Internal, Efficacious Voice, counted it the joy of their Hearts, and made it the business of their Lives to shew forth his Praises.

I could make ten Thousand Worlds; and when I have made them, I could make as many more, and more Glorious: But I would perform a Work wherein I might manifest my Glory to the utter∣most.

more to be Made and Answered, be∣fore we Apply the Doctrine.</P>
<P>Quest. 3. <HI>WHENCE is it that such as fall under the power of the Gospel, do find themselves constrained to Glorifie the Lord Jesus Christ?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> IT is because the Eyes of their Souls are opened to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee what a wonderful Person Christ is; and how infinitely worthy to be had in Eternal Honour, by Angels and Men. And why did the Angels Glorifie our Savi∣our,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 1. 6.</NOTE> not only when he was Begotten from the Dead, and after he Entred into his Glory; but when he lay in the Manger? Read <HI>Luke</HI> 2. 11, 14. &amp; you will find it was the Knowledge they had of his Divinity, his Dominion, and his All-sufficiency to Save the Be∣lieving World; to resque which from the lowest Hell, the God of Angels stooped thus low, to become a Worm, <HI>Ps.</HI> 22. 6. It was this that Constrained multitudes of the Heavenly Host to Glo∣rifie God, and Honour the Son as the Father. Why did the Disciples Glori∣fie Christ, by forsaking all to follow him? One of them tells us, <HI>John</HI> 1. 14. They beheld his Glory, as of the only
<PB N="28" REF="002265_0029_0FDAE2BAEE23F360"/>
Begotten of the Father. And if you cast your Eye into the next Chapter, <HI>v.</HI> 11. you will find, that upon Christ's manifesting his Glory—his Disciples saw the Son of God in the Son of <HI>Ma∣ry,</HI> and gave him Glory by believing on him. And the reason why so many that hear of Christ, with-hold from him the Glory due to his Name, is because they believe not the Report of the Gos∣pel concerning him; they see no form nor comeliness in him, <HI>Isa.</HI> 53. 1, 2. <HI>The God of this World hath blinded the minds of those that believe not,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 4. 4.</NOTE> <HI>lest the light of the Glorious Gospel of Christ, (who is the Image of God) should shine unto them.</HI></P>
