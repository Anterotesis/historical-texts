To the same inconveniency all simple <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> instruments are exposed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> as those with strings, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are measured by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that they do not play perfectly in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but from this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> performers fault if they are not played in tune. I would submit it therefore, to the judgment of those who have repeated frequently the words of the Text as a part of divine service; whether it were not advisable to give the only perfect Instruments we know of, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the VIOLIN, the PSALTERY, and V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>CELLO<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a place in out Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ches along with the ORGAN; of for no other reason, yet for this very good one, to be correctors of the MEAN <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and PAR<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>S DISCORDS of that otherwise magnificent and excellent instrument.</NOTE> Organ—let us there∣with

with be content. And as the placing one in this Church hath occasioned this meeting of the Congregation—permit me to conclude with offering some observations and in∣structions naturally arising from the Analogy betwixt the Organ of human contrivance and ourselves the wonder∣ful Organs of God's building.</P>
<P>THE materials of which the various parts both of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Organ and our Bodies, are composed, are of the earth; but what gives life to both descendeth from heaven. When the body of man received the breath of life, that wonder∣ful Organ was ready to praise God, so when the bellows, the lungs of the Organ of man's building, heaves and in hales the air, it may be said to be alive—it is ready to obey the singer of him who desireth it to join with the Congre∣gation in praising God.—The Spirit of the Lord giveth it breath—it soundeth—<Q>and we hear the sound thereof, but cannot tell whence that sound cometh, nor whither it goeth.</Q>—How expressive is this of the operations of that spirit who worketh is the hearts of the regenerate! Do the pipes stand in rows—does each one know it's own appointed place—and do they all receive their due pro∣portion of air from the common stock? Just so, the mem∣bers of the body natural, social, or christian stand in that relation, which they bear to each other and to the whole; none can say to the other <Q>I have no need of thee,—for no man liveth to himself.</Q>—We are members one of another, and our duty is to preserve "the unity of the spirit
<PB N="24" REF="023778_0022_0FC11FC638B7C298"/>
in the bond of peace," always remembering that, what∣ever good thing any man has, he must have received it from above.</P>
<P>BUT, alas! expressive of the humbled condition of our nature, are all the works of man; for all loudly publish their own imperfection, as well as that of him who made them!—And are not we hereby admonished to seek for perfection from God? and this perfection consisteth in be∣ing like unto God, and God, St. John tells us, is Love.</P>
<P>IN tuning the Organ, the proportion of discord insepa∣rable from the scale of Music, is distributed among the se∣veral pipes of the Octave, in order that they may all bear their proportion of this inconveniency—and consequently produce better harmony, than if the whole error was laid on any one of them. What may we learn from this—but "to bear one another's burdens"—<Q>to please each man his neighbour, for his good to edification?</Q>—and thus to fulfil the royal law of concord the companion of Cha∣rity.</P>
<P>TO the so general neglect of "mutual forbearance and mutual forgiveness," is owing the great dissimilitude be∣tween many of our modern christians and those of ancient times, <Q>when THE MULTITUDE OF THE BELIEVERS WERE OF ONE HEART AND OF ONE MIND.</Q></P>
<P>NOT more apt to go out of tune, and all sorts of instru∣ments, from the influences of heat, and cold, of moisture and drought, and of winds and calms; than are the affec∣tions of the human heart, those strings or pipes of this Or∣gan of God's building from the influences of the various objects which surround them; <Q>the lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life.</Q> How oft do one
<PB N="25" REF="023778_0023_0FC11FC72C2E1AB8"/>
or all of these despire to put out souls out of tune, and spread the jarrings of discord among us? When comes wars and lightings among us? come they not even of our lusts?</P>
<P>WHY need I pursue the Analogy further? Beholding Brethren, the weakness of our mortal nature thro' sin, in the imperfection insparable from all the works of skill and genius,—and the dignity of that nature, to which we are invited, and of which we have an engaging foretaste <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the TRANSFIGURED BODY of our LORD on Mount Ta∣ber;—be it out business and delight, to love, honor, and obey the Lord our God with all our heart and with all our soul, <Q>in every thing giving thanks and making ME∣LODY in our hearts to the Lord</Q>—and to love our neighbour as ourselves.</P>
<P>THUS prepared—we may pray "thy Kingdom come" "come Lord Jesus—come quickly."</P>
<P>So when "the AUTHOR OF PEACE, and LOVER OF CON∣CORD" shall again descend, and as at the first, breathe into man the breath of life, every one, whose life hath been a life of praise and love, and hope in Jesus, shall again live, they shall stand in his sight, and enter upon the employ∣ment of never ending praise; and they shall invite the whole creation to join with them, saying <Q>O all ye works of the Lord, bless ye the Lord, praise him and magnify him for ever.</Q> They shall in seraphic and al∣ternate hymns, incessantly chant Jehovah's works of Crea∣tion, Providence, and Redemption, with the accompa∣niment of such INSTRUMENTS OF MUSIC, of which, those used in the Temple and the Church have been the emblems types and shadows.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="023778_0024_0FC11FC8C5232B98"/>
PERSUADED of this, the Church ceaseth not to sing praises unto the Lord, well knowing that the Celebration of her Nuptials with the Lamb fast approacheth, when the grand hymenaeum shall be sung, to which every hymn performed on earth is a kind of prelude. Whilst there∣fore the day of grace lasteth let prayer and praise ascend up to glorify God, and benediction and grace will descend to sanctify and gladden the heart of man. But, when pray∣er shall be absorbed in fruition, and hope shall have fully accomplished its pursuits—Praise like her sister charity shall reign triumphant, throughout the endless ages of eter∣nity.</P>
<P><Q>PRAISE the Lord, ye house of Levi—praise the Lord ye house of Aaron—O all ye children of men bless ye the Lord, praise him and magnify him forever:—be tell∣ing of his salvation from day to day;—for he is good and gracious, and cannot worthily be praised.</Q>—Salvation be ascribed unto our God, for he hath holpen his people—and redeemed us from the hand of the enemy: hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah;—he who is the resurrection and the life—was dead and as alive again, and liveth forevermore, hallelujah, Amen.</P>
<P>NOW to the incomprehensible NAME—at which good Angles bow—and evil angels tremble—JEHOVAH ELO∣HIM—THREE PERSONS in ONE ever gloirous and adorable ESSENCE, revealed to men under the endearing names of FATHER, SON, and HOLY GHOST—be ascribed by the Church visible and invisible—and by every part of the Creation of GOD, all glory, honor, dominion, thanksgi∣ving and praise—now in time, and when time shall be no more.</P>
