<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>ADDRESS—the folly and danger of dissention—the Orator enumerates the enemies of the fraternity—reminds them of a late unseasonable interruption—a night scene in the Potter's Field—he laments the want of true zeal in the brotherhood—and boasts of his own—the force of a ruling passion—the earth con∣sidered as a great animal—the passion of love not the same in a true son of Esculapius as in other men—his own amour—a picture of his mistress in high taste—shews his learning in the description of her mouth, arm and hand—his mistress dies— his grief—and extraordinary consolation—his unparallel'd fidelity—he apologizes for giving this history of his amour—the great difficulties Anatomists have to encounter in the present times, arising from false delicacy, prejudice and ignorance—a strong instance in proof that it was not so formerly—curious argument to prove the inconsistency of the present opinions re∣specting
<PB N="iv" REF="021892_0003_0FB5EA6D96865798" MS="y"/>
the practice—he mentions many obstacles in the road to science—and reproaches them for their intestine broils, at a time when not only popular clamour is loud, but even the powers of government are exerted against them—he then encourages his brethren with hopes of better times, founded on the establish∣ment of the College of Physicians—is inspired with the idea of the future glory of that institution—and prophesies great things.</P>

<HEAD>AN ORATION, WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN DELIVERED, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<L>FRIENDS and associates! lend a patient ear,</L>
<L>Suspend intestine broils and reason hear.</L>
<L>Ye followers of F— your wrath forbear—</L>
<L>Ye sons of S— your invectives spare;</L>
<L>The fierce dissention your high minds pursue</L>
<L>Is sport for others—ruinous to you.</L>
<L>SURELY some fatal influenza reigns,</L>
<L>Some epidemic <HI>rabies</HI> turns your brains—</L>
<L>Is this a time for brethren to engage</L>
<L>In public contest and in party rage?</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="021892_0005_0FB5EA7D9C2DB308"/>Fell discord triumphs in your doubtful strife</L>
<L>And, smiling, whets her anatomic knife;</L>

<L>And leave the bleeding body to decay—</L>
<L>SEEK ye for foes!—alas, my friends, look round,</L>
<L>In ev'ry street, see num'rous foes abound!</L>
<L>Methinks I hear them cry, in varied tones,</L>
<L>"Give us our father's—brother's—sister's bones."</L>
<L>Methinks I see a mob of sailors rise—</L>
<L>Revenge!—revenge! they cry—and damn their eyes—</L>
<L>Revenge for comrade Jack, whose flesh, they say,</L>
<L>You minc'd to morsels and then threw away.</L>
<L>Methinks I see a black infernal train—</L>
<L>The genuine offspring of accursed <HI>Cain</HI>—</L>
<L>Fiercely on you their angry looks are bent,</L>
<L>They grin and gibber dangerous discontent</L>
<L>And seem to say—"Is there not meat enough!</L>
<L>"Ah! massa cannibal, why eat poor CUFF?"</L>
<L>Ev'n hostile watchmen stand in strong array</L>
<L>And o'er our heads their threat'ning staves display,</L>

<L>And shake their dreadful lanthorns in our sight.</L>
<L>SAY, are not these sufficient to engage</L>
<L>Your high wrought souls eternal war to wage?</L>
<L>Combine your strength these monsters to subdue</L>
<L>No friends of science and sworn foes to you;</L>
<L>On these—on these your wordy vengeance pour</L>
<L>And strive our fading glory to restore.</L>
<L>AH! think how, late, our mutilated rites</L>
<L>And midnight orgies, were by sudden frights</L>
<L>And loud alarms profan'd—the sacrifice,</L>
<L>Stretch'd on a board before our eager eyes,</L>
<L>All naked lay—ev'n when our chieftain stood</L>
<L>Like a high priest, prepar'd for shedding blood;</L>
<L>Prepar'd, with wondrous skill, to cut or slash</L>
<L>The gentle sliver or the deep drawn gash;</L>
<L>Prepar'd to plunge ev'n elbow deep in gore</L>
<L>Nature and nature's secrets to explore—</L>
<L>Then a tumultuous cry—a sudden fear—</L>
<L>Proclaim'd the foe—th' enraged foe is near—</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="021892_0007_0FB5EA8663999238"/>In some dark hole the hard got corse was laid</L>
<L>And we, in wild confusion, fled dismay'd.</L>
<L>THINK how, like brethren, we have shar'd the toil</L>
<L>When in the Potter's Field<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THE Negro burial ground.</NOTE> we sought for spoil,</L>
<L>Did midnight ghosts and death and horror brave</L>
<L>To delve for science in the dreary grave—</L>
<L>Shall I remind you of that awful night</L>
<L>When our compacted band maintain'd the fight</L>
<L>Against an armed host?—fierce was the fray</L>
<L>And yet we bore our sheeted prize away.</L>
<L>Firm on a horse's back the corse was laid,</L>
<L>High blowing winds the winding sheet display'd;</L>
<L>Swift flew the steed—but still his burthen bore—</L>
<L>Fear made him fleet, who ne'er was fleet before;</L>
<L>O'er tombs and sunken graves he cours'd around,</L>
<L>Nor ought respected consecrated ground.</L>
<L>Mean time the battle rag'd—so loud the strife,</L>
<L>The dead were almost frighten'd into life—</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="021892_0008_0FB5EA88C3D9FA28"/>Tho' not victorious, yet we scorn'd to yield,</L>
<L>Retook our prize and left the doubtful field.</L>
<L>IN this degen'rate age, alas! how few</L>
<L>The paths of science with true zeal pursue?</L>
<L>Some trifling contest, some delusive joy</L>
<L>Too oft th' unsteady minds of youth employ.</L>
<L>For me—whom ESCULAPIUS hath inspir'd—</L>
<L>I boast a soul with love of science fir'd;</L>
<L>By one great object is my heart possest—</L>
<L>One ruling passion quite absorbs the rest—</L>
<L>In this bright point my hopes and fears unite;</L>
<L>And one pursuit alone can give delight.</L>
<L>To me things are not as to vulgar eyes,</L>
<L>I would all nature's works anatomize—</L>
<L>This world a living monster seems, to me,</L>
<L>Rolling and sporting in th' aerial sea;</L>
<L>The soil encompasses her rocks and stones</L>
<L>As flesh in animals encircles bones.</L>
<L>I see vast ocean, like a heart in play,</L>
<L>Pant <HI>systole</HI> and <HI>diastole</HI> ev'ry day,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="021892_0009_0FB5EA8B67D1CD48"/>And by unnumber'd <HI>venous</HI> streams supply'd</L>
<L>Up her broad rivers force th' <HI>arterial</HI> tide.</L>
<L>The world's great lungs, monsoons and trade-winds shew</L>
<L>From east to west, from west to east they blow</L>
<L>Alternate respiration—</L>
<L>The hills are pimples which earth's face defile,</L>
<L>And burning <HI>Aetna,</HI> an eruptive boil:</L>
<L>On her high mountains <HI>hairy</HI> forests grow,</L>
<L>And <HI>downy</HI> grass o'erspreads the vales below;</L>
<L>From her vast body perspirations rise</L>
<L>Condense in clouds and float beneath the skies.</L>
<L>Thus fancy, faithful servant of the heart,</L>
<L>Transforms all nature by her magic art.</L>
<L>EV'N mighty LOVE, whose pow'r all pow'r controuls,</L>
<L>Is not, in me, like love in other souls—</L>
<L>Yet I have lov'd—and CUPID's subtle dart</L>
<L>Hath thro' my <HI>pericardium</HI> pierc'd my heart.</L>
<L>Brown CADAVERA did my soul ensnare,</L>
<L>Was all my thought by night and daily care—</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="021892_0010_0FB5EA919D391FF8"/>I long'd to clasp, in her transcendent charms,</L>
<L>A living skeleton within my arms.</L>
<L>LONG, lank and lean, my CADAVERA stood,</L>
<L>Like the tall pine, the glory of the wood—</L>
<L>Ofttimes I gaz'd, with learned skill to trace</L>
<L>The sharp edg'd beauties of her bony face—</L>
<L>There rose <HI>Os frontis</HI> prominent and bold,</L>
<L>In deep sunk <HI>orbits</HI> two large eye-balls roll'd,</L>
<L>Beneath those eye-balls, two arch'd bones were seen</L>
<L>Whereon two flabby cheeks hung loose and lean;</L>
<L>Between those cheeks, protuberant arose,</L>
<L>In form triangular, her lovely nose,</L>
<L>Like EGYPT's pyramid it seem'd to rise,</L>
<L>Scorn earth, and bid defiance to the skies;</L>
<L>Thin were her lips, and of a sallow hue,</L>
<L>Her open mouth expos'd her teeth to view;</L>
<L>Projecting strong, protuberant and wide</L>
<L>Stood <HI>incisores</HI>—and on either side</L>
<L>The <HI>canine</HI> rang'd, with many a beauteous flaw,</L>
<L>And last the <HI>grinders,</HI> to fill up the jaw—</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="021892_0011_0FB5EA9462A22660"/>All in their <HI>alveoli</HI> fix'd secure,</L>
<L>Articulated by <HI>gomphosis</HI> sure.</L>
<L>Around her mouth, perpetual smiles had made</L>
<L>Wrinkles wherein the loves and graces play'd;</L>
<L>There, stretch'd and rigid by continual strain,</L>
<L>Appear'd the <HI>zygomatic</HI> muscles plain,</L>
<L>And broad <HI>montanus</HI> o'er her peeked chin</L>
<L>Extended, to support the heav'nly grin.</L>
<L>In amorous dalliance oft I stroak'd her arm,</L>
<L>Each rising muscle was a rising charm.</L>
<L>O'er the <HI>flexores</HI> my fond fingers play'd,</L>
<L>I found instruction with delight convey'd—</L>
<L>There <HI>carpus, cubitus</HI> and <HI>radius</HI> too</L>
<L>Were plainly felt and manifest to view.</L>
<L>No muscles on her lovely hand were seen,</L>
<L>But only bones envelop'd by a skin.</L>
<L>Long were her fingers and her knuckles bare,</L>
<L>Much like the claw-foot of a walnut chair.</L>
<L>So plain was complex <HI>matacarpus</HI> shewn</L>
<L>It might be fairly counted bone by bone.</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="021892_0012_0FB5EA955558B8C0"/>Her slender <HI>phalanxes</HI> were well defin'd,</L>
<L>And each with each by <HI>ginglymus</HI> combin'd.</L>
<L>Such were the charms that did my fancy fire</L>
<L>And love—chaste scientific love inspire.</L>
<L>AT length my CADAVERA fell beneath</L>
<L>The fatal stroke of all subduing death—</L>
<L>Three days in grief—three nights in tears I spent,</L>
<L>And sighs incessant gave my sorrows vent.</L>
<L>FEW are th' examples of a love so true—</L>
<L>Ev'n from her death I consolation drew,</L>
<L>And in a secret hour approach'd her grave</L>
<L>Resolv'd her precious corse from worms to save;</L>
<L>With active haste remov'd the incumbent clay,</L>
<L>Seiz'd the rich prize and bore my love away.</L>
<L>HER naked charms now lay before my sight,</L>
<L>I gaz'd with rapture and supreme delight,</L>
<L>Nor could forbear, in extasy, to cry—</L>
<L>Beneath that shrivell'd skin what treasures lie!</L>
<L>Then feasted to the full my amorous soul,</L>
<L>And skinn'd and cut and slash'd without controul.</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="021892_0013_0FB5EA9D94CA8280"/>'TWAS then I saw, what long I'd wish'd to see,</L>
<L>That heart which panted oft for love and me—</L>
<L>In detail view'd the form I once ador'd,</L>
<L>And nature's hidden mysteries explor'd.</L>
<L>ALAS! too truly did the wise man say</L>
<L>That flesh is grass, and subject to decay—</L>
<L>Not so the bones—of substance firm and hard</L>
<L>Long they remain th' Anatomist's reward.</L>
<L>Wise nature, in her providential care,</L>
<L>Did, kindly, bones from vile corruption spare,</L>
<L>That sons their fathers' skeletons might have</L>
<L>And heav'n born science triumph o'er the grave.</L>
<L>MY true love's bones I boil'd—from fat and lean</L>
<L>These hands industrious scrap'd them fair and clean,</L>
<L>And ev'ry bone did to it's place restore,</L>
<L>As Nature's hand had plac'd them long before;</L>
<L>These fingers twisted ev'ry pliant wire</L>
<L>With patient skill, urg'd on by strong desire.</L>
<L>Now what remains of CADAVERA's mine,</L>
<L>Securely hanging in a case of pine.</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="021892_0014_0FB5EAA1B38B2120"/>OFTTIMES I sit and contemplate her charms,</L>
<L>Her nodding skull and her long dangling arms,</L>
<L>'Till quite inflam'd with passion for the dead</L>
<L>I take her beauteous skeleton to bed—</L>
<L>There stretch'd, at length, close to my faithful side</L>
<L>She lies all night a lovely grinning bride.—</L>
<L>EXCUSE, my friends, this detail of my love,</L>
<L>You must th' intent, if not the tale, approve;</L>
<L>By facts exemplary I meant to shew</L>
<L>To what extent a genuine zeal will go.</L>
<L>A mind, so fix'd, will not be drawn aside</L>
<L>By vain dissentions or a partial pride;</L>
<L>But ev'ry hostile sentiment subdue</L>
<L>And keep the ruling passion still in view.</L>
<L>FALSE delicacy—prejudices strong,</L>
<L>Which no distinctions know 'twixt right and wrong,</L>
<L>Against our noble science spend their rage</L>
<L>And mark th' ignorance of this vulgar age.</L>
<L>TIME was, when men their living flesh would spare</L>
<L>And to the knife their quiv'ring <HI>nates</HI> bare,</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="021892_0015_0FB5EAA453FFA4E8"/>That skilful surgeons <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">TALIACOTIUS.</NOTE> noses might obtain</L>

<L>To give their dead relations to our use;</L>
<L>Talk of decorum—and a thousand whims—</L>
<L>Whene'er we hack their wives' or daughters' limbs;</L>
<L>And yet their tables daily they supply</L>
<L>With the rich fruits of sad mortality;</L>
<L>Will pick, and gut and cook a chicken's corse,</L>
<L>Dissect and eat it up, without remorse;</L>
<L>Devouring fish, flesh, fowl, whatever comes,</L>
<L>Nor fear the ghosts of murder'd hecatombs.</L>
<L>NOW where's the difference?—to th' impartial eye</L>
<L>A leg of mutton and a human thigh</L>
<L>Are just the same—for surely all must own</L>
<L>Flesh is but flesh, and bone is only bone;</L>
<L>And tho' indeed, some flesh and bone may grow</L>
<L>To make a monkey—some to make a beau,</L>
<L>Still the materials are the same, we know.</L>

<L>Sour envy strews the rugged path with thorns,</L>

<L>And persecution lifts her lash on high?</L>
