<OPENER><SALUTE>SIRS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE <HI>principal</HI> author of the following sheets is under so many obligations to you of late, that he cannot pass this opportunity of tes∣tifying his respect—he is sensible of your favors, and particularly the obliging condescension that some have shewn in sitting for their poetical pictures—The gallery is not yet complete, but as soon as the circuit is over, I hope to be able to make a larger addition to the group, for the entertainment of the winter connoisieurs.</P>
<P>I must also observe, that it would be pre∣sumption in me to claim all the merit of the <HI>Philadelphiad;</HI> a judicious reader will easily per∣ceive that it is by different hands; and as the same gentlemen have promised their future aid, whenever their necessary avocations will permit, I have no doubt but my next volumn will, if possible, be more spirited and complete, as the subjects are numerous that are yet unpainted.</P>

<L>Yes you condemn the city and its ways,</L>

<L>Or court the fanning fond refreshing breeze.—</L>
<L>Tell <HI>Crambo</HI> this—it throws him in the fits;</L>
<L>" Lord, sir! the stupid soul has lost his wits—</L>
<L>" Go mix with Indians! Quit the shining town!"</L>
<L>He says with anger and a senseless frown;</L>
<L>For well he minds the time he drove the team,</L>
<L>Ere <HI>merchant</HI> dignifi'd his humble name.</L>
<L>Then grogram jackets serv'd in place of silk,</L>
<L>Instead of wine the kind nutricious milk;</L>
<L>Then pennys sav'd were pennys to the last;</L>
<L>He scrap'd &amp; scrap'd, &amp; as he scrap'd laid past;</L>
<L>The whip, the spade, the plough was his resort,</L>
<L>No frolicks saw him nor the mirthful sport.</L>
<L>Some thirty pounds to city brings the swain,</L>
<L>But mean low penury rewards with gain;</L>
<L>A merchant soon he strutted like the rest,</L>

Cash made him bold and ignorance gave face</L>
<L>To follow what to others was disgrace;</L>
<L>Grown fat at length and politic and great,</L>
<L>See slaves of different colours round him wait.</L>
<L>With formal wig and smooth unmeaning face,</L>
<L>He reads the news and wishes for a <HI>place,</HI></L>
<L>Thinks all the judges are a pack of fools,</L>
<L>Make him the chief and he'll prescribe new rules</L>
<L>Turn wardens, sheriffs, justices out of doors</L>
<L>And make a law to tax the city wh-r-s—</L>
<L>But for the country—name not such a place,</L>
<L>The very thought to <HI>Crambo</HI> is disgrace.</L>

<L>Think not I rail against the saving scheme,</L>
<L>That I applaud, but empty pride I blame.</L>
<L>If fortune smiles be modest and be wise,</L>
<L>Nor let her smiles surround thee with disguise;</L>
<L>Hide as you will and cover all you can</L>
<L><HI>Crambo</HI> appears conspicuous in thy van:</L>
<L>Wit, genius, knowlege, breeding, learning, sense,</L>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS this work was undertaken with no evil motive, the author thinks it in∣cumbent on him to obviate some imputati∣ons, which he thinks he has been unjustly laid under.</P>
<P>Three persons under the character of Gen∣tlemen, went lately to the office of Messrs. Kline and Reynolds, and requested that they might be informed of the author of the Philadelphiad? Messrs. K &amp; R sent for the author—the Gentlemen asked him if he was not the author of the Philadelphiad?—he was answered in the affirmitive—They then said that it was a shame for a Gentle∣man of <HI>his profession</HI> to have any thing a-do with such a publication—the author said, indeed he was very sorry that several people had so truly merited the censures they re∣ceived—But Mr—interrupts one of the gentlemen, you know that private cha∣racters should not be meddled with!—O d—n it, 'tis a shame by G—He was going on with this courtly dialect when the author asked him if private vice was less cen∣surable than public?—He had no argu∣ment to confound this, and upon the author's
<PB REF="018730_0080_0FA8104D6B49C980"/>
telling him that he would have none of his impertinence, he seemed inclined to com∣promise matters, and went so far as to inti∣mate that he would furnish the author with a sum of money if he would contradict, in his next publication, circumstances of cha∣racters that the pointed out—The money was refused, and the characters shall stand as they are justly painted.—Our opi∣nions may sometimes be wrong, but our judgments shall never be perverted.</P>

<P>AMIDST the multipliciy of business which favour has heaped on me from time to time I have just snatched a moment—a moment that I could only devote to charms like yours—to request that you will use your never-failing influence to in∣duce your Fathers, Husbands, Brothers and Sweethearts to peruse the following sheets, which are calculated for your entertainment as well as theirs—and for the information of the COMMONWEALTH in general.</P>
<P>The author had once given over the notion of continuing this work, but he found the calls of the public so importunate for the se∣cond and third volumes, and the demand

for them so extraordinary, that at their so∣licitation he is willing to expose vice and contribute as much as in his power to their amusement.</P>

<L>And that religion has no modern laws:</L>

<HEAD>POLITICS.</HEAD>
<L>WHEN man was man, and spoke his candid mind,</L>
<L>No deep laid politics was then designed,</L>
<L>For words convey'd the language of the heart,</L>
<L>Nor claim'd enforcement from the aid of art;</L>
<L>But times are alter'd, and it's now the mode</L>
<L>Each forward fool with honors high to load,</L>
<L>To turn the state politically right,</L>
<L>And then to turn the shining day to night,</L>
<L>Bluster politically to the crowd,</L>
<L>And in the senate daring deep and loud;</L>
<L>Canvass politically through the town,</L>
<L>And knock impertinent mechanics down:</L>
<L>The word is great—it bears a large import,</L>
<L>As how to swagger boldly through a court,</L>
<L>To get in office and the public cheat,</L>
<L>And fatten up like hogs on public meat.</L>
<L>By politics we are to understand,</L>
<L>The dark cabals that undermine the land,</L>
<L>For each low minion of usurped sway,</L>
<L>Blots its intent, and wipes its worth away;</L>
<L>Dark machinations cloak'd beneath its name</L>
<L>Some empty praise demand in place of fame,</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="018730_0089_0FA8105AB71F7B10"/>
To gloss the crimes politically done,</L>
<L>Before to glaring turpitude they run.</L>

<L>IN Heav'n of late the Gods in council sat,</L>
<L>Much they debated, much their wond'rous chat,</L>
<L>Jove, Mars and Mercury were there in state,</L>
<L>And joined their deep opinions in debate;</L>
<L>Each little God and Demi-god was there,</L>
<L>Ev'n soft Adonis favor'd by the fair:</L>
<L>Their converse long on heavenly things de∣tained,</L>
<L>When Jove got up and thus in terms com∣plain'd,</L>
<L>"My great co-partners in these realms a∣bove,</L>

'Tis wrong in Gods to judge unfair, you know,</L>
<L>What if we should to wordly regions go</L>
<L>And be convinc'd? we then can judge with ease;</L>
<L>'Tis but a trip—the Jaunt perhaps may please"—</L>
<L>The Gods consent—the whole together move,</L>
<L>And came to judge of beauty and of love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A spacious plain encircled round with trees,</L>
<L>Cool'd by a gentle fanning zeph'ry breeze,</L>
<L>Compos'd the hall—the court was summon'd straight,</L>
<L>The female world of beauty on them wait</L>
<L>Each to receive the prize her charms de∣creed,</L>
<L>And those that wanted, fresher charms to plead.</L>

<L>Apollo Umpire sat o'er all the rest,</L>

<L>And all their looks with animation shine;</L>
<L>Through light-laid garments and through veils of gauze</L>
<L>Their charms appear'd and silent claim'd ap∣plause:</L>
<L>The girls of Philadelphia all were there,</L>
<L>In soft assemblage round the speaker's chair,</L>
<L>Eager to grasp Apollo's beaut'ous prize,</L>
<L>While emulation sparkled from their eyes.</L>
<L>With dread they saw the sacred judge appear,</L>
<L>And some were trembling, some were mute through fear,</L>
<L>Till some with looks the best they e'er put on</L>
<L>Step'd boldly up and then address'd the throne.</L>

<L>Sir Arthur rules the senate from the chair</L>

<L>His time politically once expired,</L>

<L>That crowns the tables of the pamper'd great?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He set his wits to work to find some ends,</L>
<L>To crown his wishes and surprize his friends:</L>
<L>Not long he study'd when a thought inspir'd</L>

<L>But yet 'tis requisite that you should know;</L>
<L>First in the field I fought the daring foe,</L>
<L>Pass'd many hardships, many dangers brav'd</L>
<L>And once at Princeton all our freedoms sav'd—</L>

<L>Among the citizens I now retire;</L>
<L>But first and foremost 'tis my heart's desire</L>
<L>This honorable house would point some ways</L>
<L>That I might merit still the public praise—</L>
<L>Or grant a <HI>pension,</HI> that I may retire;</L>
<L>I have a precedent for this desire,</L>
<L>Sir Arthur Onslow, Englands boast &amp; fame,</L>
<L>The Commons Speaker, got it for the same—</L>
<L>Now as similitude 'twixt him and me</L>
<L>Are very great, 'tis hop'd this house will see</L>
<L>The claim of their petitioner is just,</L>
<L>He therefore to their gen'rous aid will trust,</L>
<L>And your petitioner, in duty bound,</L>
<L>Will pray that health and wealth may still abound,"</L>
<L>Surpriz'd each member, heard the strange request,</L>
<L>With such audacity of words exprest;</L>
<L>And had the same been granted as requir'd,</L>
<L>Each private soldier might the like desir'd.</L>
<L>Yet did the house with all its wisdom make</L>
<L>The auction act, which merchants since did break,</L>
<L><PB N="46" REF="018730_0120_0FA80F110E60D8E0"/>
For when their cash or custom was no strong,</L>
<L>They sold their goods at auction for a song</L>
<L>This law was made, a sinecure bestowed.</L>
<L>And public money to the private flow'd,</L>
<L>The constitution by the same infring'd:</L>
<L>And public virtue by the same unhing'd,</L>
<L>The free exposure of the merchant's store</L>
<L>Was then consin'd, a thing unknown before,</L>
<L>For tyrant auctions was a thing quite new,</L>
<L>At least not so monopoliz'd by few.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Years upon years sir Arthur fatten'd here,</L>
<L>As fully by his bigness doth appear;</L>
<L>Shipwrecks and failures filled his needy purse,</L>
<L>Which broken merchants oft' were wont to curse,</L>
<L>Their lost effects he sacrificed of course,</L>
<L>In place of mending made their cases worse,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length too great our canting caitif grew,</L>
<L>And public notice on his greatness drew,</L>
<L>They saw him hold a perquisite too long,</L>
<L>Which plainly did to other folks belong.</L>

<L>Arthur un-officed, like a vulture rang'd:</L>
<L>And with the times opinions held or chang'd:</L>
<L>His last resource has been the S—k—s chair,</L>

<L>The wheedling arts that at the state-house pass'd;</L>

<L>And stain'd the progress of elections fair.</L>
<L>A deep finesse, sir Arthur and his friends,</L>
<L>Had secret laid to gain their private ends,</L>
<L>The tradesmen's votes were much the best they knew,</L>
<L>Therefore they started with the same in view;</L>
<L>They first declar'd they were mechanics friends,</L>
<L>And if the public should but crown their ends,</L>
<L><PB N="48" REF="018730_0122_0FA80F1272ADB1A0"/>
They would support their int'rest to the last</L>

<L>Now that Sir Arthur's party gained their ends,</L>
