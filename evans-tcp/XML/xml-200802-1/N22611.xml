<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE substance of the following pages is chiefly drawn from those excellent au∣thors, Home, Cullen, and M'Bride; whose names alone are a sufficient recommendation: They were compiled at the request of our friend Mr. Asbury.</P>
<P>The work contains a good description of each disorder, and its remote causes, as far as known The proximate cause is generally o∣mitted, being unintelligible to those who are not acquainted with medicine, of little use, and much disputed by physicians. The cure is as simple as possible, so as not to interfere with efficacy: few medicines being recommended, and no compounds where they could be omitted. To this is prefixed the management of the sick, about which the attendants are usually much at a loss.</P>
<P>Such medicines as are frequently used are put at the end, numbered and referred to, which pre∣vents frequent repetition, but those that are not so general are inserted in the reading. Will not this be much more agreeable to the reader, than a general reference or a general insertion?</P>
<P><PB REF="029891_0003_0FE2C3BC3759B168"/>A few disorders are omitted, because they are not proper to this country, or because they are unmanageable even in the hands of physicians, or for other as good reasons: otherwise it com∣prehends as many disorders as Dr. Cullen has treated on.</P>
<P>It is recommended to the Methodist Society in particular, by the author, their Friend.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.
OF FEVERS IN GENERAL.</HEAD>
<P>FEVERS admit of a two-fold distinction: first, with respect to their duration; as into continued, Remittent and Intermittent Fevers.</P>
<P><HI>Continued fevers</HI> go on to their end, without any very obvious change for better or worse, in a period of twenty-four hours.</P>
<P><HI>Remittent fevers,</HI> either obviously abate at some pe∣riod or periods during twenty-four hours, or are like a number of short continued fevers linked together, abating once in the course of two or three or more days.</P>
<P><HI>Intermittents</HI> go perfectly off every day and return the next, which is called a Quotidian; or every other day, leaving an intermediate well day, called Terti∣ans; or every fourth day inclusive, leaving two well days, called Quartans. In this manner they go and come till they change, or finish their course.</P>
<P>The second distinction respects the state of the system: as Inflammatory, Nervous, and Putrid fevers.</P>
<P><HI>Inflammatory fevers</HI> show more or less the symptoms of general inflammation; strong action <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> absence of every symptom of putridity and inse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>; they are most commonly continued.</P>
<P><HI>Nervous fevers</HI> show a general debility, in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>∣lity and irregularity, without any symptoms <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="6" REF="029891_0005_0FE2C3C84A5850C0"/>tending much to dissolution; though a slight and slow tendency is observable, after they have continu∣ed for some time.</P>
<P><HI>Putrid fevers</HI> sometimes show signs of inflammato∣ry action for a while; but these quickly give way to symptoms of putrefaction, viz. blackness of the gums and tongue; from being lined with foetid secretions: a blackness and foetor of what is discharged by vomit∣ing, which usually attends: and the same appearance of many of the secretions and excretions, particular∣ly the stools; to which may be added a quick suc∣ceeding debility.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.
INFLAMMATORY FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>THIS fever most frequently attacks the young in the vigour of their life; such as are of a rustic sanguine athletic constitution, who indulge themselves in living freely: though sufficient causes will bring it on in some degree, in almost any constitution and way of living. It attacks at all seasons, but most frequent∣ly in the spring and beginning of summer.</P>
<P><HI>Causes.</HI> Heat and cold alternately, or variously ap∣plied, fatigue, anger, immoderate use of spirituous liquors, watching, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> It discovers itself by a lassitude, with a dull sensation of the body, debility, alternating chills and heats, tremors, pains throughout the whole body, but more particularly about the shoulders, back, knees and head. These are succeeded by an intense and burning heat, an inextinguishable thirst, inflamed eyes, tumefaction or fulness of the face, sickness and vomiting, inquietude, anxiety, full and strong pulse, dry skin, red (though sometimes watery) urine; rough, dry, yellow, or dark coloured tongue, covered with a crust; difficult breathing, costiveness, cough, watching, de∣lirium, stupor; and if the fever is not checked, a co∣ma,
<PB N="7" REF="029891_0006_0FE2C3CDA44E9610"/>or constant tendency to sleep, tremors, partial convulsions as of the hands, &amp;c. hiccough, involunta∣ry discharges of the belly and bladder take place and close the scene in death. This is a description of it in its most violent degree. In the greatest number of cases, we meet with it far more moderate; a strong pulse, sick stomach and thirst being the chief symptoms.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient should be confined to his bed, in a cool, dark and silent room; the cool∣ness to be regulated by the season. He should ab∣stain from all kinds of meats and strong drinks. For food; panada, barley, jellies, light unseasoned puddings and pies, may be given in small quantity. For drink; lemonade, vinegar and water, barley water, herb teas with lemon juice, apple water, tamarind water or jelly and water, may be given largely.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> If the fever be violent, and the patient as de∣scribed in the first paragraph of the case, from half to two thirds of a pint of blood should be taken away (according to the age and customs of the patient) as quick as possible; which may be repeated the next day in lesser quantity, if the fever has not abated. After the first bleeding let him take one ounce of Glauber salts, which will frequently exclude the necessity of another bleeding. After this the bowels should be opened daily if required, by a common clyster. if after one bleeding and a dose of salts, the fever does not go off, which it seldom does, let the pati∣ent have one of the powders No. 1. every two hours, provided they will remain on his stomach: but if they will not, give the saline mixture No. 2. two table-spoon∣fuls every two hours; and after this has been given some time, if the patient's skin become soft and moist, it should be continued in, otherwise lay it aside and try the powders again. If these when given for a day or two do not lessen the fever, or if they will not re∣main, and the saline mixture is ineffectual, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> bleeding has been practised as far as prudent; it will then be necessary to put a blister to the back of the
<PB N="8" REF="029891_0007_0FE2C3D41E097FB8"/>neck, and to soak the patient's feet in lukewarm wa∣ter for an hour if he can bear it; after this try the powders, or the mixture again, and they will then have their only chance, and in many cases will be effectual.</P>
<P>In the slighter cases of this fever, such as I have said, we most commonly meet with. If the patient will allow of it, one bleeding will be proper, after which or in such as will not allow bleeding, give a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ke; two grains of tartar emetic divided into three doses and taken in half an hour, or fifteen grains of ipecacuana, or half a table-spoonful of antimonial wine will answer; after which give the powders or the mix∣ture, and open the bowels with a dose of salts. After the fever has gone off, which usually is attended with a sweat, if the patient is much reduced, let him take a tea-spoonful of bark in port wine, or in water eve∣ry three hours till he has taken an ounce, after which he may take one or two more at longer intervals. He should use gentle exercise in a carriage, and return gradually to his business and diet.</P>
<P>There is a fever which has the name of synochus, which in the first stage is of the above type, but after a while quickly changes to the putrid, to be hereafter described. In such a case all the management and cure above should be relinquished as soon as the change is observed, and the management and cure for the putrid immediately adopted.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.
NERVOUS FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE of relaxed fibres and weak nervous system, are the persons most subject to this fever.</P>
<P><HI>Causes.</HI> Excessive evacuations, repeated salivations, immoderate venery, depressions of the mind from grief, watching and night study, humid stagnant air of subterraneous apartments, indigestible food, especi∣ally such as is unfit for nutrition; as of cold watery fruits and vegetables; thin cloathing, rainy seasons, soft moist winter, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="029891_0008_0FE2C3D97A2F4380"/><HI>Symptoms.</HI> This fever approaches with dejection of mind, loss of appetite, oppression, sleeplessness, in∣voluntary groans, repeated sighs, fear, unusual lassitude after motion, and alternate successions of cold and heat.</P>
<P>After some days a swimming or pain in the head comes on with sick stomach and vomiting of insipid phlegm, great weakness, moderate heat, insensibility to thirst; frequent, weak, and sometimes intermitting pulse; a moist tongue, sometimes red and at other times covered with a white or yellowish tough mucus; dry lips, oppression about the breast and difficult breathing, pale watery or whey-like urine: a dull sense of pains about the breast and head, dozing, deli∣rium, redness and warmth of the face, whilst the feet are c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld; a tendency and disposition to be easily and frequently disturbed by dreams:—after these have taken place and continued some time, they are followed by immoderate sweats and wasting laxes, great dulness and slothfulness of the external and internal senses, anxi∣ety and fainting. And now nature being exhausted by the disorder, the tongue trembles, the extremities from a coldness become cold, the nails turn livid, sight and hearing perish, the delirium turns to a coma, the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lly and bladder are involuntarily evacuated, topi∣cal convulsions come on, and death closes the scene, usually before the fourteenth day. The symptoms in∣crease in the evening.—The delirium is only a mutter∣ing continually; quite different from the delirium of the former fever: though in this there is generally a great insensibility, and towards the end a loss of sight and hearing, yet at times in the beginning there is a great and preternatural sensibility to light and noise: sometimes an eruption like millet seed appears without any alteration for better or worse. A continuance of this fever has brought on temporal idiotism, which vanished with the debility.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient should be confined to his bed in an airy darkened room, and kept a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ably warm or cool, according to the season. His room, bed and body clothes, face, hands and feet should be
<PB N="10" REF="029891_0009_0FE2C3DFDA3F3D00"/>kept clean. His diet should be light though nourish∣ing, and given frequently, rather than in large quan∣tities at once; it should be mild: chicken water and broth, or beef tea may be given if the patient desires it, and the effect proves it to be useful; but the gene∣ral stock of food should consist of the various prepara∣tions of mild, digestible, nourishing vegetables, suf∣ficiently well known to every house-keeper; those should be suited to the patient's appetite, and chang∣ed so as not to pall him with any one. Wine and water may be used from the beginning, though then it may only be given to allay the thirst, and should be made weak: five or six times a day a cup full may be given, even though the patient do not ask for it; but as the strength fails it should be made stronger and stronger, and given in as large quantity as a person in health could take. When the wine has not the effect of increasing the symptoms and rendering the pulse too quick, it may be safely continued in.—Claret is sup∣posed to be the best.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> A gentle vomit of 12 grains of ipecacuana in a little water may be given in the beginning, and may be repeated the next day. The bowels should be opened with thirty grains of rhubarb, and costive∣ness continually prevented by small doses of the same medicine. A blister should be applied to the side early in the disease, and when it has drawn, the water let out, and the part dressed with a colewort leaf or a little Turner's cerate; after this another may be applied to the other side, or to the back of the neck, provided no bad symptoms follow the first, if they do, blisters should be laid aside till a state of insensibility comes on, when they should be applied successively, as long as they are attended with advantage. If the patient's skin be dry in the beginning, let him take three o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> four grains of James' powder, in thick syrup three or four times a day, washing it down with snake-root tea; yet not so as to sweat the patient. If the James' powder is not to be had, one-eighth of a grain of tartar emetic may be used in its stead. When the de∣bility
<PB N="11" REF="029891_0010_0FE2C3E554400560"/>increases, let the patient begin and take two table-spoonfuls of the decoction of bark No. 3. every hour or two, putting a little mint water with it, and when the patient has taken this some time, let him take the bark in substance with wine: one tea-spoon∣ful of bark in two table-spoonfuls of old claret every two or three hours: this or No. 4. should be continu∣ed in till the patient perfectly recovers.</P>
<P>When the patient has been much harassed for want of sleep, have his feet bathed at evening in tepid water, and give him ten or fifteen drops of laudanum. This practice may be continued as long as it proves effec∣tual in procuring sleep. In those cases that proceed from excessive evacuations there is little hope and scarce any thing should be attempted, but the strengthening plan.</P>
<P>The patient should carefully shun all the causes, and use a generous diet with regular varied exercise of body and mind, and be sparing of his strength.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.
PUTRID FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE who are of a relaxed habit and gloomy disposition; those who have been debilitated by living upon bad victuals, by venery, famine, labour, or loss of rest, &amp;c. easily take this fever (which is caused by putrid contagion or noxious air) and diffi∣cultly emerge from it.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> An intense consuming tho' remitting heat, particularly inwards; small, frequent, and unequal pulse without strength; throbbing of the arteries that run along the neck and temples; great prostration of strength, heaviness without sleep; and when sleep does take place, little or no refreshment is gained from it;
<PB N="12" REF="029891_0011_0FE2C3ECD46085B0"/>an anxious, dejected, and desponding mind, nausea, and vomiting of black bile, pain of the head and tem∣ples, redness of the eyes, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>out their sockets; dusky countenance, noise in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> interrupted breath∣ing, with sighs and foetid breath; pains about the sto∣mach, joints and back, difficulty of lying in one pos∣ture, trembling, delirium. At first the tongue is whit∣ish but quickly changes blackish, whilst the lips, teeth and gums are beset with a tough disagreeable mucus; an inextinguishable thirst attends with a bitter mawk∣ish taste, which is communicated to the drink. The urine, on the increase of the disorder, becomes blackish or red with a sediment: The sweats become foetid, the stools lived, black or bloody, and very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tid: and if the fever goes on, a thrust and ulcers attack the mouth and throat; blood is discharged from different parts, a hiccough and other partial convulsions come on, which death scarce ever fails to follow.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient should have fresh air ad∣mitted by keeping the door of his chamber open, if it is not too cold, and by opening his windows if it is summer time, and the weather clear. Salt petre or vinegar should be burned upon the hearth in winter, and boughs of trees and flowers thrown about the room in summer.</P>
<P>His hands, face and feet should be washed daily in vinegar and water, or wine and water; he should be served frequently, and shifted in bed and body clothes as frequen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y as can be afforded, if it is daily: in fine, the greatest attention should be paid to cleanliness.— His food should be mostly of acid vegetables, such as please his appetite and stomach best. His drink should be port wine diluted<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this he should drink more and more of, as he becomes more debilitated, so as to make it his drink and medicine: a quart a-day may be used; this he should continue in for some time after he has recovered, though in smaller doses: A fresh air∣ing every day, after recovery, will be highly useful.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> An emetic of eight grains of ipecacuana and one of tartar emetic, or half a table-spoonful of anti∣monial
<PB N="13" REF="029891_0012_0FE2C3F173AF4320"/>wine, should be given as quick as possible, be∣side this, twenty-five or thirty grains of rhubarb, or two drachms of cream of tartar, should be given in a lit∣tle jelly, to open the bowels, after which the decoction of bark No. 3. should be given: two table-spoonfuls with a little mint water, every hour; if the stomach bears this well, and the symptoms of putrefaction and debility increase, the bark in substance should be used: a tea-spoonful in lemon juice and mint water every hour. But if the stomach does not bear the bark, or if the heat and fever be considerable, apply a blister to the breast, and give a dose of the saline mixture or one of the following pills between the times of taking the bark, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Camphor beat to an impalpable powder, with com∣mon spirits, twenty-four grains, powdered seneca root as much; make them up with syrup.</P>
<P>If the stomach still refuses the bark in the above ways, try it in triple quantities in clysters, or try the vinous tincture, No. 4. The bark is the only chance, we are therefore to persist in its use till a cure is made. Three drops of oil of vitriol in a glass of water every hour, may be tryed where the delicacy of the stomach or fever, will not admit any preparation of bark; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as it is apt to gripe, it should never be used when the bowels are affected.</P>
<P>Clysters of salt, sugar, and decoction of bitter herbs are to be used to keep the bowels regular, or some of the gentle purges mentioned above; but it will be of∣ten best to use first one and then the other, according to circumstances. In case this fever should be of a re∣mittent form, the remissions should be greatly attend∣ed to, and a double quantity of bark given if possible. Sometimes a lax with distension of the belly comes on after a while, in such a case the belly should be foment∣ed with bitter herbs, boiled and applied warm, and one grain of ipecacuana, with five drops of laudanum, given every two hours.</P>
<P>Sometimes spots break out in this fever, then it has been termed the Spotted Fever; at other times there is a yellowness of the skin, then it is termed the
<PB N="14" REF="029891_0013_0FE2C3FA62C11070"/>yellow or West India fever. In this last case the symptoms of putridity are in this country more lenient, and a considerable vomiting sometimes hinders the giv∣ing of medicine: in this case a blister to the breast and the effervescing saline mixture have been found effectu∣al to stop the vomiting; but in general the treatment is the same as recommended above.</P>
<P>In the end of these fevers, some physicians recom∣mend blisters to rouse the patient: if they are applied, the skin should not be pealed off as is sometimes done, but only opened to discharge the water, and then dressed with Turner's cerate. But the beginning or first stage is the most proper for blisters.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V.
REMITTENT FEVER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAUSES.</HI> Exposure to the sun for hours together, or the effects of a cool evening, and other similar causes after fatigue or summer heat. Thus there is no difference in the real causes of this fever and intermit∣tents, except in the degree and mode of their appli∣cation.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> Alternating cold and heat, followed by a continued heat and a fever: Sometimes a delirium comes on at the first attack.</P>
<P>The patient is distressed with thirst and vomiting, usually of bile; pain of the head, back and joints; the region of the stomach swells, and becomes painful; the tongue is white and moist, and the patient is harrassed with sleeplessness; the skin and eyes are of a yellow cast; the pulse is sometimes a little hard, and seldom full; the bowels are sometimes bound, sometimes loose: with these symptoms the fever usually proceeds, for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 days, at one of which times, after a little sweat it remits, and the patient becomes evidently better. After a few hours have elapsed, com∣monly in the evening, the accession comes on, sometimes with, at other times without a chill, and so goes on as
<PB N="15" REF="029891_0014_0FE2C3FF03D6AE68"/>before: In this manner, that is, by accessions and re∣missions, the fever goes on to its final period.</P>
<P>A copious sweat or discharge of blood from the nose, or an universal yellowness, commonly attend the conclusion of it.</P>
<P>After the fever has gone off, a great lightness of the head attends, so that the patient can scarce walk; rheu∣matic pains, and dropsical swellings sometimes follow.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient should be kept cool and airy; he should have plenty of acid drinks, as lemon∣ade, jelly, tamarind water, and for food, he should have toasted bread moistened with a little tea, baked fruits, rice, sago, barley, &amp;c. but these, though proper, will seldom have a place, as the patient can scarce ever con∣tain on his stomach what his little appetite inclines him to take: but the toast has often been found to stay, when nothing else would.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> If the vomiting be considerable, a little ca∣momile tea may be given to promote it a moment or two, that a remission may be procured to give the sa∣line mixture No. 2. one table-spoonful every hour. When this sits on the stomach pretty well, ten drops of antimonial wine and a little mint water may be ad∣ded to each dose, and the medicine continued: but if the vomiting is only slight, the best way to procure a remission of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ymptoms will be to give an emetic, one tea-spoonful of antimonial wine, may be given eve∣ry ten minutes until it operates, or 12 grains of ipe∣cacuana may be given at once, after which the mix∣ture may be given in the manner directed with antimo∣nial wine.</P>
<P>If the vomiting resists every thing given, or if a re∣mission does not take place in a few days, blisters should be used; on the breast in the first case, on the back of the neck in the last. Sometimes a bundle of mint stew∣ed in wine, and applied to the breast, has been found useful in checking the vomiting, therefore it may be tried before a blister.</P>
<P>Costiveness should be regularly obviated by taking a tea-spoonful or more of cream of tartar, or by using
<PB N="16" REF="029891_0015_0FE2C405B13FC5D8"/>the common clysters of salts, sugar and milk occa∣sionally.</P>
<P>When the patient has suffered for want of sleep, af∣ter giving a clyster, and bathing the feet in lukewarm water for half an hour, ten or fifteen drops of lauda∣num may be given in a dose of the saline mixture No. 2. and this should be done after noon before the in∣crease of the fever, for it usually makes some increase towards night.</P>
<P>When the fever remits, the decoction of bark should be given, two table-spoonfuls every hour, and if the accession is postponed by it, the bark in substance should be given, as long as the accession is absent: in some cases it will put it off altogether; then, as well as when the fever ceases, the bark should be given in large quantities, until the patient recovers his strength.</P>
<P>When a lax attends, four grains of rhubarb and one of ipecacuana with two drops of laudanum, may be given every three or four hours instead of the saline mixture.</P>
<P>When great sweats attend in the end, it may be ne∣cessary to add five drops of elixir of vitriol to each or every other dose of bark: in case a headach follows, apply a small blister behind the ear, and repeat it if necessary. The patient should be very careful in avoid∣ing the causes of this fever, or he will experience a relapse.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VI.
INTERMITTENT FEVER (COMMONLY) FEVER AND AGUE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAUSE.</HI> The relaxing heat of summer, especially when accompanied with moisture and bad air of marshy places, will so relax the surface and expose the extreme vessels to the air, that nothing more than the usual effect of common air is necessary to bring on the fever; at other times, when the predisposition is not so great, a cool air will produce it.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="029891_0016_0FE2C40B0DF4B930"/><HI>Symptoms.</HI> A languor with yawning and stretching, coldness, sick stomach, rigors and tremors, usually at∣tend the commencement; the cold with shivering con∣tinues in a very considerable degree, for one, two or three hours, when it begins to give way, first to flushes, and then to a continual burning heat and fever, with a full pulse and thirst. Pain of the head and frequently of the joints, attended sometimes with delirium. Af∣ter this has continued for some time, a sweat breaks out, which becomes profuse, and this is succeeded by an intermission of a part, a whole, or two days, ac∣cording to the type. See page 5. In the intermis∣sion, the patient is affected with scarce any thing but debility. The fever returns again in the end of the time mentioned, with the same symptoms, and so goes on to its end, unless it changes its form. Quotidians come on in the morning, and usually attack the deli∣cate and irritable. Tertians come on about noon, and usually attack the more robust and vigorous. Quar∣tans come on in the afternoon, and most commonly attack the aged and torpid.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> Sometimes the ague so reduces the patient, that it will be necessary to keep him warm and give a little wine; but this is seldom the case. In common nothing is necessary but to lie down. In time of the fever, lemonade and other acid drinks, or warm teas may be used; the former will be most grateful.</P>
<P>In the intermissions, port wine and water, and a strengthening easy digested diet will be proper.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> In the beginning of the cold stage, if the patient is able to puke, he should take one; three grains of tartar emetic in a gill of water, may be taken in the course of forty minutes, if required to take all: or 15 grains of ipecacuana in a spoonful of water, or a tea-spoonful of antimonial wine every fif∣teen minutes: either of these may be used; the tartar is the most active and effectual, but acts too rough with some. When this has been taken, and the fever
<PB N="18" REF="029891_0017_0FE2C412ACC5A3B0"/>has come on, a sweating should be encouraged by tak∣ing about three pints of warm drink in the course of two hours, to which one hundred drops of antimonial wine may be added, to make it more effectual. In case the patient cannot take a puke, let him take an Anderson's pill to open his bowels before the time of the ague, and when the fever has come on, and con∣tinued a while, let him take fifteen drops of laudanum and fifteen of antimonial wine, in a cup of warm tea every half hour, for three times.</P>
<P>But when nothing forbids a puke but the person's inclination, he may take just before the fit, or after it is over some time, the following powder; twenty grains of rhubarb, and five of calomel in a little syrup, and when the fever comes on, take the warm drink as above.</P>
<P>These medicines will prepare for the exhibition of bark, which should be given immediately after the sweat goes off. Any of the preparations may be given, but the powder is the best; it may be given in mint water, milk or wine; one tea-spoonful every hour, till the ague comes on again; then it should be laid aside till this is over, when it is to be given again; the pa∣tient should not cease under an ounce and an half, or two ounces. If, when this has been taken, the ague does not cease, another puke should be used as before In all cases the bowels should be kept open by Ander∣son's pills or rhubarb.</P>
<P>Sometimes twenty drops of laudanum given before the ague, will put it off, and sometimes giving it just be∣fore the patient is expected to sweat, will prepare for the bark; sometimes a quantity of snake-root tea at the same time will prove effectual: and in many cases bit∣ters, of horehound, dogwood, rue, &amp;c. will do as well as bark.</P>
<P>The fever and ague, after it has continued for some time, is apt to associate custom with its causes of re∣currence; and thus it will frequently continue through such seasons as it would not have begun in. In such cases as these almost any alteration in the system will lessen or remove it; thus keeping the patient under
<PB N="19" REF="029891_0018_0FE2C417628AAE90"/>expectation; fear or joy have often removed it; and thus the impositions of old women have often been effectual, when the faith of her patient has roused his expectation and fixed his attention. Though such things may at times be allowed, yet I would caution every prudent person to keep his skin to himself, and not let ignorant quacks fill up their lack of knowledge upon him, with the virulence of an arsenical plaster, or a more dangerous bolus.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.
HECTIC FEVER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAUSES.</HI> Violent racks of the constitution from any cause, absorption of matter from ulcers, exces∣sive relaxation, and delicacy of any part that is ex∣posed to irritation, as the lungs, stomach and bowels; all these causes are attended with general debility, and particular relaxation of the parts that defend the ten∣der extreme vessels, from the irritations which act about them.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> The fever usually comes on in the fore∣noon, sometimes with considerable chills or coldness, which last some time; this is succeeded by heat, a quick, small and weak pulse in general, though some∣times there is some hardness in it, especially in those who are not much reduced, and early in the complaint; this sometimes lessens towards evening, and again in∣creases at night; at other times it continues on with∣out any very obvious change till towards morning, when it intermits or greatly remits with a profuse swet which lasts a considerable time; the sweats do not appear in the first stage, that is, in profusion. A headach usually attends the fever, as also a sick sto∣mach, both of which grow better in the intermission or remission.</P>
<P>The tongue is usually clean in this fever, the belly at first is often bound, but in the end a lax almost al∣ways
<PB N="20" REF="029891_0019_0FE2A1B09D978408"/>attends. The patient wastes away gradually, his feet swell, particularly at night, his hair falls off, his nails become crooked and thick, his face sharp, and a general failing takes place in every thing but his ex∣pectations of getting better, and his understanding, which usually remain to the last.</P>
<P>This is the most usual form, but there is some variety, owing to the variety of the parts affected, and the state of the patient.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient should have the lightest and most nourishing food given him in small quantities at a time, and at such times chiefly as the fever is ab∣sent or slight, thus his breakfast or dinner at ten o'clock, should contain most of what he should eat. Milk is very proper when the stomach will receive it: sometimes it may be most agreeable when diluted with water and sweetened, at other times it may sit better when boiled. Custards, light puddings, chicken wa∣ter and broth, beef tea, rye mush, corn mush, with the common vegetables of the grain kind, are mostly proper. Weak wine and water in the absence of fe∣ver; barley water and sage tea at other times, will be proper for drink. The patient should be kept clean, and when his strength admits, he should be aired in a chair, and at all times have access to pure air.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> In many cases it will be needless to attempt any thing but a removal of the cause, when the fever will quickly cease: but in general both the one and the other are to be combated. For treating the causes I re∣fer to the places where they are treated of (though some of them could not have a place in this book, as they belong to surgery) for the treatment of the fever alone, the debility should be removed and the fever in∣terrupted: for the first, when nothing forbids, bitters and bark are necessary; also elixir of vitriol, which may be given to sixty drops a day. These are to be ta∣ken whilst the fever is off, or when it has greatly re∣mitted, just before the time when the return is expect∣ed, and again after it has commenced, one of the fol∣lowing powders may be given: ipecacuana two grains,
<PB N="21" REF="029891_0020_0FE2C424E5A90D60"/>magnesia one tea-spoonful, mix them and give it in a little camomile tea. When a lax comes on there is little hope, but the following may be given: colum∣bo root one drachm, pour one gill of boiling water upon it, and in a quarter of an hour strain it off; to this twenty drops of laudanum may be added; this may be used in the course of eight hours, and repeated.— Rice will now be the best food.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.
INFLAMMATION OF THE EYE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAUSES.</HI> These act either externally or internally, though frequently both take place in producing the affection.</P>
<P>The externals are, violence, dust, cold winds, changes from heat to cold, viewing minute objects or bright bodies; metallic fumes, great heat, especially when accompanied with moisture; night reading, &amp;c. The internal causes are, checked excretions, as the menses, &amp;c. repulsion of some eruptive disorders, long continued ulcers dried up, immoderate use of spiritu∣ous liquors and spices, fevers, measles, scrophula, venereal disease, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> Redness, swelling, stiffness and pain of the ball of the eye or the lids; both from an inflam∣mation of the vessels that pass over and through them, being filled with too much blood, or with red blood, instead of the fine white parts of it.</P>
<P>When the inflammation is considerable, a fever at∣tends; and in such cases there is danger of the effects, unless speedily prevented by curing the disease.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> In no case a cure can be hoped for unless the causes be removed, which in many cases will be followed with an immediate cure. In any bo∣dy be lodged in the eye, it is to be extracted, and if another disease be the cause, it must be cured by the means directed for such disease. In every case the patient should avoid exercising his eyes any more than
<PB N="22" REF="029891_0021_0FE2C42BEB303A88"/>what there is necessity for:—He should confine him∣self to a dark room, or apply a fold of green silk over his eyes, and use an umbrella in the summer. His food should be light and mostly vegetable, in all cases without pepper or mustard. His drink should be cooling and acid, without any mixture of spirit. His room should be cooled with sprinkling in the summer time.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> If there be a fever, or if the inflammation be considerable, and the patient able to bear bleeding, he should lose half a pint of blood, which may be re∣peated if necessary; this should be followed by a dose of salts, or if the patient's case does not require bleed∣ing, or other circumstances prevent it, the salts then should be the first thing. All this is to be done after the cause is removed, and thus in many cases where removing the cause will be the chief means of cure, they will have no place; as where the inflammation pro∣ceeds from the venereal disease, scrophula, &amp;c. One of the fever powders No. 1. when the fever continues, or the inflammation remains obstinate, given every four hours, will be serviceable. The belly should be kept regular by cream of tartar or small doses of salts, or of jalap and nitre: as jalap fifteen grains, nitre twenty-five, mix them.—For external applications, a blister behind the ears is most effectual, and to the eyes the following: sugar of lead twelve grains to half a pint of water, or as much white vitriol to an equal quantity of water: to either of which, when the inflammation has continued, and the former re∣medies have been used, may be added a table-spoon∣ful of brandy.</P>
<P>These external applications (the blister excepted) will be proper in every case and time. The weak∣ness that follows requires that the patient use either a general or topical cold bath, and avoid much ap∣plication and exposure.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.
INFLAMMATION OF THE BRAIN.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is either a symptomatic disorder, as when it follows in the course of a primary affection: or it is original, being primary itself—of this alone I shall treat, that requiring the treatment of the con∣comitant disorder.</P>
<P>It usually attacks in the heat of summer those of an irascible disposition, who are in their youth and given to study.</P>
<P><HI>Causes.</HI> Drunkenness, watching, long exposure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the sun, anger, excessive cogitation, g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>, care, ve∣hement desires, external violence, certain poisons, and suppressions of particular discharges; as the piles, the discharge after parturition.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> It begins with rigors, which are follow∣ed by heat, pain and throbbing of the head, disturb∣ed sleep, noise within the head and ears, inflammation and pain in the eyes, with inability to bear the light and noise, and a bloated countenance—the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> low, oppressed and quick, often weak as well as low, though sometimes it is hard: the patient continues without any sleep for a long time, sometimes till the eighth day; the arteries along the neck perceptibly throb, and blood sometimes issues by drops from the nose; great debility, anxiety and sighing attend, yet the patient is subject to anger, f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ce delirium, startings and convulsions. When the disorder has ceased, a swimming and heaviness of the head, weak eyes and great delicacy of hearing attend for a consi∣derable time.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient should be confined in an airy, darkened, silent and cool room; his bed should be hard, and his head somewhat raised upon it. He should have plenty of acid, cool drinks, without any mixture of spirit. His food should be of p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
<PB N="24" REF="029891_0023_0FE2C43876DE99B0"/>barley, jelly, &amp;c. The causes of the disorder must be carefully removed.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> The patient should be bled pretty freely, and this may be repeated again and again in less quantities, during the first 48 hours; provided the symptoms demand it, and the patient be able to bear it:—the pulse will usually be the best guide; for if this does not sink very low, there will be no danger from bleeding. A dose of salts should be given after the first bleeding, and it may be necessary to repeat this the next day. Clysters may be given daily, such as No. 5. one of the fever powders No 1. may be given every three hours, beginning after the operati∣on of the first dose of the salts. The patient's head should be shaved and washed with cold vinegar and water. If the delirium runs on after the above eva∣cuations, a large blister should be applied to the crown of the head, and when this has drawn, others, if ne∣cessary, may be applied to the ankles.</P>
<P>When the patient has suffered some time for want of sleep, the feet should be bathed half an hour or twice as long, in water moderately warm, and if this is inef∣fectual, let him have ten or fifteen drops of laudanum, one tea-spoonful of paregoric at night, with this care, that if it makes him worse, to discontinue it; but if it has the desired effect, to persist giving it every night, if required.</P>
<P>A nourishing diet and the use of wine should be gradually entered into, after the symptoms of danger are perfectly gone, in order to prevent the succeed∣ing symptoms of debility.</P>
<P>Great care will be necessary to avoid the causes of this disorder, as slighter ones may cause a re∣lapse or repetition.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.
QUINCY.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAUSES.</HI> The application of cold to the neck or throat, a stream of cool air applied with force to the very part; as in riding and running: these causes pro∣duce their effect more certainly when preceded by heat.</P>
<P>Exercising the parts that suffer, as in singing, and loud speaking; acrids, mechanic bodies, suppressed evacuations, or artificial evacuations, that have been long used, neglected.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> This complaint usually appears with red∣ness and swelling of the glands situated on each side of the palate; one is usually most swelled in the beginning, and as this declines, the other increases; a pain that shoots towards the ear attends, with feverish symptoms, and a strong, full, quick pulse: The patient feels a disagreeable clamminess, and the tumour is usually tip∣ped with whitish mucus.</P>
<P>In some cases the external parts are much swelled; sometimes scarce any tumour is to be perceived by look∣ing into the mouth, and at the same time the difficul∣ty of swallowing and pain may be very considerable: In the worst cases the breathing becomes very diffi∣cult, the tumours closing up the passage almost entire∣ly; then the patient sits with his mouth open, his drink regurgitates through his nostrils, and he is ready to strangle every minute for want of a free respiration, which is totally impeded when the patient dies.</P>
<P>What is usually termed a sore throat, is a lesser de∣gree of this same affection, therefore the same reme∣dies may be used, omitting the most general and pow∣erful one of bleeding.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient should be kept neither hot nor cold: he should have a light vegetable diet of a fluid preparation; his drink should be of the acid kind, and not cold or warm, but just aired. His head should be kept up in bed, or he may sit up altogether;
<PB N="26" REF="029891_0025_0FE2C4454A8EF508"/>speaking, and every exertion of the throat, should be avoided, and the causes should be removed.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> The patient should be bled pretty freely, and this may be repeated the next day if necessary: he should take a dose of salts as soon as possible, and then a blis∣ter should be applied under the throat, of a slim form, so that it may reach from ear to ear: the bowels should be regularly kept open: before the tumour has become very considerable, fifteen grains of ipecacuana will be of great service. In such patients as do not allow of bleeding, this may be the first medicine.</P>
<P>Warm water and vinegar should be inspired from a proper machine for the purpose, or from a funnel put over a wooden bowl of water and vinegar, the mouth should be frequently gargled with astringent washes, as sage tea and vinegar; or alum-vinegar and honey, or decoction of oak bark and salt petre. Scarifications with a lancet are necessary where there is danger of choaking; and likewise to let out the matter, when the tumours have suppurated.</P>
<P>If the patient is liable to frequent returns of this af∣fection, I would advise him to use the cold bath daily; at any rate to wash his neck, and habituate himself to wear nothing but a very thin stock or ribband, instead of a large neckcloth.</P>

<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XI.
PUTRID SORE THROAT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS disorder has for its <HI>cause,</HI> specific contagion, and therefore attacks all ages and constitutions.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> It begins with chills, which are follow∣ed by an intense and burning heat, a swimming and pain of the head, a troublesome sensation in the throat, sickness and vomiting, looseness, inflamed and watery eyes, tumid and flushed face, with a stiffness of the neck, a small, frequent and irregular pulse, foetid breath and a disagreeable taste. Very soon, white spots appear on the glands each side of the palate, and
<PB N="27" REF="029891_0026_0FE2C449E709BE70"/>these with the palate appear red, swoln and glossy: these spots spread and unite, covering almost all of the mouth with thick sloughs, which falling off, leave ul∣cers in their places: the redness and tumour are some∣times extended to the internal parts of the nose.</P>
<P>On the second day, or later, efflorescences appear on the skin, which are sometimes in such small emi∣nences as scarcely to be seen, but more usually spread in red patches, so as to cover the whole skin; begin∣ning first about the face and neck, and so extending to the extremities, which feel stiff and swelled; this usu∣ally continues about four days, and then goes off with a peeling of the skin. The glands about the neck are sometimes swelled to an alarming degree. As the complaint advances, discharges of blood from different parts are frequent, and sometimes a gangrene takes place at the beginning of the windpipe or of the oeso∣phagus, the channel which leads to the stomach.</P>
<P>The patient's voice is hoarse and flat, though his swallowing is not usually much impeded; with these symptoms it runs on from two to seven or more days, increasing every evening.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> For food, drinks, and general manage∣ment, the same may be used as directed for the putrid fever, only a less degree of cold will be requisite in this.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> Ten grains of ipecacuana should be given early in the complaint; three grains of calomel in a little honey, may be given once or twice the evenings after the puke, and if the first dose produces more than two stools, it should be checked by giving ten drops of Laudanum. This medicine will often prove very efficacious, without producing any discharge. Some of the preparations of bark, or the powder, which is best, should be given every two hours after the puke, and to the end of the complaint. The throat should be frequently washed with the following: one hundred drops of elixir of vitriol or twenty drops of oil of vitriol to half a pint of water, and one spoon∣ful of honey. Spring water coloured with indigo has been found useful as a gargle. Port wine should be
<PB N="28" REF="029891_0027_0FE2C4503B7C7C30"/>given to a pint, or quart a day, with the bark. If the tumour in the inside of the throat be considerable, a blister should be laid on the outside.</P>
<P>For the swelling of the legs which sometimes follows, the patient may use eight drops of elixir of vitriol with each dose of bark, four times a day.</P>

CROUP OR HIVES.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAUSES.</HI> Foregoing disorders, as the measles and the hooping cough: cold moist air from the water.</P>
<P>It most frequently happens to such as live in seaport towns; and to children, from the time they are wean∣ed to their twelfth year.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> It sometimes comes on with the symp∣toms of a common cold only; but the peculiar symp∣toms are a hoarseness, and ringing sound of the voice; at the same time there is an uneasiness, or pain in the throat, and a whizzing noise in breathing, as if the passage was too much straitened for the air; the patient has a cough that is either dry, or accompanied with the discharge of flakes of phlegm, like a membrane; the pulse is quickened, and an uneasy sense of heat at∣tends. By looking into the throat, a redness and flakes of phlegm like those discharged, may sometimes be perceived. It has happened that the patient has been taken off without scarce any complaining, in three, four, or five days.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient should not be kept cold, nor disagreeably warm, he should have a spare thin ve∣getable diet, with light acid, or bitter drinks, as teas of various herbs. In time of coughing, he should be raised and assisted, to keep him from strangling.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> The patient should take a puke as quick as possible. (If he is twelve years old, ten grains of ipe∣cacuana, and half a grain of tartar emetic will not be too much, for there is a great degree of insensibi∣lity in the stomach in this complaint; if he is only
<PB N="29" REF="029891_0028_0FE2C456F5B9A598"/>four years old, let him have half as much, or one tea-spoonful of antimonial wine, to be repeated every quarter of an hour, till it operates.) After taking the puke, he should take four grains (if twelve years) of calomel, and ten of jalap, the evening of the same day; after this for three or four days, he should take one day the puke, and the next the purge; after the first puke and purge, a blister should be laid on the back of the neck. Throughout the complaint, the steams of warm vinegar, or of water in which there is a large lump of lime slacking (which is supposed to be a solvent) may be drawn into the throat; warm teas, and soaking the feet, may be used to restore the per∣spiration to the surface.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.
THE MUMPS.</HEAD>
<P>CONTAGION is the cause of this complaint.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> It makes its appearance with the usual febrile symptoms, of chills succeeding heat, and quickened pulse; this is shortly followed by a swelling, at the corner of the lower jaw, of a movea∣ble glandular nature; in a little time it diffuses itself over the whole neck; sometimes both sides are affect∣ed. It continues increasing till about the fourth day, and then declines with the fever. As the swelling re∣cedes, some tumour is apt to take place in the testes of males, and in the breasts of women. Sometimes when this has not taken place, or when it has been re∣pelled by imprudent applications, the fever has conti∣nued, or increased with delirium.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient should be kept upon a low vegetable diet, and not expose himself to cold. The above in general will be sufficient, but when the cir∣cumstance mentioned takes place, it will be necessary to direct something more than the above for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> We should apply warm stewed bitter herbs, or warm bread and milk poultices to the parts; and if
<PB N="30" REF="029891_0029_0FE2C45DAEAD43B8"/>fever and delirium be considerable, the patient should be bled if he be able to bear bleeding; otherwise a puke should be the only evacuant, viz. fifteen grains of ipecacuana, more or less, according to the patient's age. Besides this or these, it may be necessary to ap∣ply a blister to the back of the neck. In slighter cases the puke and fomentations will be sufficient. In all cases, costiveness should be prevented by clysters, cas∣tor oil, or salts.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.
PLEURISY OR INFLAMMATION OF THE INTERNAL PARTS OF THE BREAST.</HEAD>
<P>THE end of winter, spring and beginning of sum∣mer are the usual times that this disease is pre∣valent; all ages and most constitutions are liable to it, but the phlethoric, and those of a rustic constitution, who have seen twenty years, and not exceeded sixty, are most liable.</P>
<P><HI>Causes.</HI> Cold and heat applied alternately, or un∣equally, straining or injuring of the parts, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> It usually begins with chills, which are followed by heat, quick, strong and full pulse, head-ach, difficult breathing, dry cough at the beginning, though sometimes it begins moist: towards the end, or after it has continued, it is always moist, and some∣times a very considerable quantity of yellow mucus is discharged: this is not unfrequently streaked with blood. Most frequently, a pungent pain attacks the side<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> about the middle of the sixth or seventh rib, but if the pain should attack any other part of the chest, and should not be so violent, yet accompanied with the other symptoms, particularly the full, strong and quick pulse, we are to consider the complaint as the same.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> This should be identically the same with what is directed in Chap. II. only with addition of mucilaginous and syrup drinks to allay the cough; as
<PB N="31" REF="029891_0030_0FE2C46256A881B0"/>of flaxseed, and mallow tea with honey: a little lemon juice will make it very agreeable.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> From half to two thirds of a pint, or more of blood, should be taken away on the first appearance, and if the symptoms continue, it may be repeated in eight hours. After the first bleeding, a dose of salts should be given, and small doses of the same, or common clysters may be given regularly to prevent costiveness. Immedi∣ately after the patient's first bleeding, a blister should be applied as near as possible to the pained part, and one of the fever powders, No. 1. given every hour, be∣ginning after the operation of the salts is over. If after the blister has drawn, the pulse continues up, and the pain has not considerably abated, the second bleeding should be immediately made, and if in half an hour af∣ter that, the pain does not give way, a second blister should be applied on a fresh part, or on the opposite side. The powders should be continued every two hours. But in general, one bleeding, a blister, the powders, and keeping an open belly, will be sufficient. Nothing but a relaxation of the pain and fever, should induce the patient to omit any of the above remedies, for life and death are pretty certainly fixed to the narrow compass of a few days. If the pulse is strong, and bleeding has been omitted as long as six or seven days, it would be then better done than let alone; but if the pulse flags, and the patient has had a frequent shivering about the last days, it will then be better, if not the very safety, of the patient, to forbear. At such a time a blister might be applied without any injury, but if a suppuration has taken place, it will be of no service; however those who are not proper judges, had better make the application, lest there might have been an insufficient inflammation for to suppurate in that time; and with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the pati∣ent may use what will be proper in the last case of every pleurisy when the cough is troublesome: a tea-spoonful of paregoric in a little flaxseed, or other tea, once in four or five hours. In the latter stages, it may be ne∣cessary to support the patient's strength with decoc∣tions of bark, and a light nourishing diet.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="029891_0031_0FE2C4689F5FEFC8"/>Seneca snake root tea, the pleurisy root, or common salt petre taken to one fourth of an ounce a day, in whey or gruel, may sometimes alone, and often after a bleeding, remove a pleurisy; but they should only be tried, when the person cannot procure the above pre∣scribed remedies.</P>

BASTARD OR SPURIOUS PLEURISY.</HEAD>
<P>THIS usually attacks the aged, those of a phleg∣matic full habit, who have injured their constitu∣tions by excess of drinking, particularly, and are liable to the vicissitudes of the weather, from being much exposed.</P>
<P><HI>Cause.</HI> The long application of cold, suddenly succeeded by heat, and heating drinks; this, with the predisposition laid down above, is the chief, if not the only cause.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> It makes its appearance with chills and flushes, which are followed by a slight fever, with a soft, not very frequent pulse. The heat of the patient is not usually much increased; a pain affects the side, or breast, which is not very pungent, but rather dull and extending; a violent pain in the head, sick stomach and sometimes vomiting, are more or less present. From the beginning, it is common for a cough, strait∣ened breathing, and spitting of tough mucus to attend. An erysipelatous redness often appears on the cheeks, and a looseness attends the advanced stage of the dis∣ease. The patient is apt to be heavy and drowsy; thus though there be a pain in the side, and a fever, it is easily distinguished from a true inflammatory af∣fection of the breast.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient should be kept tolerably warm, his diet should be light and nourishing, and in the beginning, if the feverish symptoms are not consi∣derable, he may have weak wine and water for his drink; in the end it will always be proper, for the
<PB N="33" REF="029891_0032_0FE2C46F7730DC48"/>patient frequently becomes fainty, and is not able to take any thing besides. Lemonade may be used, when wine and water cannot be given for the fever; and when lemons cannot be got, vinegar and water, or cyder and water.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> Bleeding though it may sometimes be pro∣per, as when the patient is of a more robust habit, and better constitution than what is described above, and when he has been accustomed to bleeding, and withal the pulse and pain are not low; yet, it should be used sparingly and cautiously, otherwise, in ninety cases out of one hundred, it would be injurious. In the beginning it will be proper to give ten or twelve grains of ipecacuana; or a tea-spoonful of antimonial wine, every fifteen minutes until it operates; a blister may be put on at the same time, as near as possible to the pain; the puke may be repeated once or twice if necessary, and sometimes it will be necessary to lay on another blister close by the former; twenty grains of jalap, or thirty grains of rheubarb, or a table-spoonful of castor oil, or four or five grains of calomel, may be used to remove any costiveness that is present: this should be attended to throughout.</P>
<P>For the cough, two drachms of gum ammoniac, dis∣solved by trituration in a mortar, with half a pint of water, may be given; one table-spoonful every hour: or an ounce of syrup (commonly called oxymel) of squills, in as much water, may be given in the same way.</P>
<P>Seneca snake root or pleurisy root tea may be used, if they cannot be procured; to either of these me∣dicines at night a dozen drops of laudanum may be added, in order to allay the cough, that the patient may rest; and if the cough is very frequent in the day, a few drops may be taken every now and then.</P>
<P>Towards the end when the patient grows weak, he should use about sixty drops of elixir or vitriol a-day, and use a decoction of bark or some good bar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="029891_0033_0FE2C475DE63D8A0"/>Great care will be requisite to prevent the return of this disorder, when the weather is favourable to pro∣duce it.</P>

SPASMODIC STITCH, OR INTERCOSTAL RHEUMATISM.</HEAD>
<P>THIS complaint is prevalent when the changes of weather are frequent, as in the spring and fall. It usually attacks the young, those under forty years, those who are of a delicate, effeminate constitution, rather than those of a broken state of health.</P>
<P>Exposure to cold, more particularly after heat and damp cloudy weather are the causes.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> It begins with a lancinating pain, most frequently about the ribs of one side; this remits a while, and then returns again, so as almost to make the patient scream out. After a while it becomes fixed, and does not abate, though it is apt to extend, and even to change its place, so that the muscles of the breast are frequently attacked, and there are pains in o∣ther parts that point out a rheumatic affection: with the above a fever, sometimes pretty smart, at other times less, attends. In most cases the pulse is not strong, but easily stopped by pressing it, to what it is in true pleurisy. Frequently a cough attends, which is apt to increase towards the end of the other symptoms, at which time it is accompanied with spitting of yellow, tough mucus; some degee of costiveness usually at∣tends, and most of the symptoms are worse at night.</P>
<P>The breathing is not in general affected so much as in pleurisy, little or no cough attends; the head is usu∣ally much affected with pain, and as the pain of the side declines, the knees or back are sometimes attacked, if not before.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient should be kept on a vegetable, moderate diet.</P>
<P>His drink may be warm herb teas.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="029891_0034_0FE2C47A799F09A0"/><HI>Cure.</HI> If the patient be pretty full of blood, and his pulse tolerably strong, it will then be prudent and useful to take away half a pint or more of blood. A blister should be laid over the part, a dose of castor oil, or of fifteen grains of jalap and as much cream of tartar, should be given to open his bowels: if the pain continues, some proper sweating medicine should be given, as four grains of camphor beat up with honey into a bolus, to which two grains of ipecacuana may be added, this much should be taken every three or four hours, washing it down with seneca snake root tea, or warm baum tea: or in the place of these a tea-spoon∣ful of paregoric and twenty drops of antimonial wine, may be taken every three hours; using plenty of warm tea in the intervals. This last mixture will be pro∣per for the cough, taken in the same quantity and times.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII.
INFLAMMATION OF THE STOMACH.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAUSES.</HI> External violence, high seasoned food, acrid medicine or poisons; hard bodies swallowed, as of glass or stone; cold drink, when the body is heat∣ed; distension; from an over quantity of food that is of difficult digestion; inflammations of the adjacent parts extending to the stomach: besides these causes, a trans∣lation of affection in other disorders are causes; as in the gout, small pox, measles, St. Anthony's fire; but these require a treatment connected with the primary affection, which cannot be treated of here.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> A violent, pungent, and sometimes throbbing pain at the pit of the stomach, with burn∣ing and painful vomiting; a hiccough, anxiety and difficult breathing; great weakness; after taking any thing into the stomach, the pain increases, and it is discharged by vomiting; the pulse is commonly small, hard and quick.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="029891_0035_0FE2C480484CB1E0"/><HI>Management.</HI> The patient should be kept from swallowing any thing but mild drinks, as barley wa∣ter, milk and water, &amp;c. he should keep himself as still as possible in a dark room.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> If any thing that is acrid, or that may in∣jure the stomach mechanically, has been taken in, it should be evacuated as quick as possible, by taking plenty of warm water, and applying a feather to the throat, to induce immediate vomiting; but if the vo∣miting is already considerable, it should not be solicit∣ed after vomiting; if the cause be some acrid, it should be diluted with mucilaginous drinks, as gum arabic dissolved in water; or oils may be given, as sweet oil or almonds oil; at the same time it should be counter-acted by a proper medicine. Thus if it be vitriol, or spirit of salt or aqua fortis, let the patient take a table-spoonful of salt of tartar, or if he can get none of that, let him get a piece of chalk and eat it. If it be arse∣nic, two tea-spoonfuls of precipitate sulphur may be swallowed. After this, or where these have not been required from the nature of the cause, the patient should lose a pint of blood, and in case the pain con∣tinues, and the pulse does not sink and intermit, half as much more may be taken away in eight hours following; a blister after the first bleeding should be applied to the left side, and clysters of oil, sugar, milk, and a little salt petre should be injected every three hours: four grains of sugar of lead in a little water may be given every two hours the first day: nothing but the medicine mentioned should be applied by the mouth.</P>

<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient should have light, liquid preparations of vegetables for food, and his drink should be jelly and water, or apple-water, or lemon∣ade, or molasses and water with a little vinegar: these or any of them, may be taken plentifully.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> He should be bled as quick as possible; the quantity should be pretty large, proportioning it to the habit of the patient; this may be repeated in eight hours, if the symptoms demand it, and the pulse al∣low it. After the first bleeding, a blister should be ap∣plied over the pain, and a clyster of oil, molasses, milk and Glauber salts injected: this may be repeated every three or four hours with small quantities of salts after the first time: eight grains of nitre, if it does not ex∣cite vomiting, may be given in a little drink every hour. If the inflammation should suppurate and dis∣charge matter downwards, nothing should be used but the mildest, nourishing spoon-diet of broths, &amp;c.</P>

A blister should be applied over the pained part, after the first bleeding, and after that the parts around may be fre∣quently fomented with warm stewed herbs, as mallows, horehound, wormwood, &amp;c.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXII.
ACUTE RHEUMATISM.</HEAD>
<P>THIS attacks at all seasons, but rarely at any other time than the spring and fall, when the vicissitudes of weather are great.</P>
<P><HI>Causes.</HI> Cold applied to the body, when unusually warm, or cold applied partially to the body.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> A pain affects some of the joints, and sometimes the muscles, so as to extend from one joint to another. Sometimes almost every joint in the body is affected, and then the complaint comes on with chills, and fever, with a strong pulse, for the most part full. In some cases, the fever precedes the pains, at other times, it is the contrary; the joints affected become red and swelled: the fever and pains usually increase at night. If the general affection continues long the patient's senses become somewhat impaired for a while.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient should be kept cool, ex∣cept when under the operation of sweating medicine, then he should lie between blankets; he should be kept from all but light vegetable food, and cool acid or warm herb drinks, which may be given plentifully; and when the complaint has gone off, he should wear flannels till warm weather returns, and then use bathing.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> The patient should be instantly bled, as free∣ly as his habit and age will bear, and his complaint demands; this may be repeated in smaller quantities, for once or twice in the course of four days, if neces∣sary. After the first bleeding, a dose of salts should be given, and when that has done operating, one of the powders, No. 1. should be given, every two ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>. If this does not answer, let him have twelve grains of Dover's powders (which may be had at the apotheca∣ries
<PB N="41" REF="029891_0040_0FE2C49F53FE3D88"/>shops) for two or three nights, lying then between blankets. If any pain still continues, it may be looked upon as verging to chronic rheumatism, and the fol∣lowing may be given: one hundred drops of vola∣tile tincture of guaiacum, in a little water, three times a-day.</P>
<P>In general nothing can be done that will be of ser∣vice as an outward application; however, a little Castile soap, dissolved in water, may be used to satisfy.</P>
<P>In slighter cases the bleeding may be omitted, and the salts with a common sweat of seneca tea used.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIII.
CHRONIC RHEUMATISM.</HEAD>
<P>THE former disease is apt to terminate in this; especially when the patient is advanced in years: Cold is the common cause of it.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> A pain of some of the joints, or about the junction of the bones, with a stiffness of the part. No redness or swelling like that from inflammation affects the part, though after a long continuance, an enlargement of the joints is apt to take place. Lit∣tle or no fever attends here, heat lessens the pain, and cold increases it; quite contrary to what takes place in the preceding complaint. When the pains fix about the small of the back, the affection is termed a Lumbago; when about the hip, in which case the patient becomes somewhat lame, a Sciatica.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The part affected, if possible, should be constantly wrapt in flannel, the patient should use wine with any food he may chuse, which will agree with his stomach.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> Ninety drops of volatile tincture of guaiacum, should be taken in a little water, four times a-day; if this does not answer, the following pills may be used till they produce some effect; twelve grains of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and twelve grains of opium, to be made into one do∣zen
<PB N="42" REF="029891_0041_0FE2C4A71116CD38"/>pills, one to be taken morning and evening, wash∣ing it down with a large quantity of Virginia snake root, lignum vitae, or sassafrass tea. Besides these, there are other common remedies, which are less cer∣tain, as a decoction of prickly ash, mustard whey, balsams, &amp;c. In what is called the sciatica, twelve drops of spirit of turpentine, in a little honey, taken night and morning, is particularly effectual.</P>
<P>The external remedies in rheumatism, are spirits of camphor, spirits of hartshorn and oil; oil and spirits of turpentine, electricity applied by insolation, and drawing sparks; the flesh brush, cold water dashed on. However, this last is more effectual in cases that are between the inflammatory and chronic, where one joint is chiefly affected.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIV.
TOOTH ACH.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAUSES.</HI> A general cold, cold air applied to the cheeks in an unusual and sudden manner, acrids, sweets, or acids applied to the teeth, the acrid matter of a rotten tooth, extraordinary violence, as in break∣ing hard substances, blows, &amp;c. Besides these there are certain disposing causes, under which the usual ex∣posure we are constantly liable to, is a sufficient cause; as a nerve being laid bare, by rotting or extraction of a tooth, pregnancy, hysteric dispositions, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> These are various in different circum∣stances. In the tooth ach that proceeds from com∣mon cold, there are frequently symptoms of a rheu∣matic affection of the adjacent parts, the pain extend∣ing from the tooth to the face, and along up to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>empl, with a throbbing of the arteries, and redness, sometimes a little swelling of the face, and withal a feverishness. In most other cases, a violent pain of the tooth, with a little inflammation of the gum, are the only symptoms, except that about the terminati∣on, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> relaxed habits) is apt to swell.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="029891_0042_0FE2C4AD369FA480"/><HI>Management.</HI> The patient should carefully avoid every cause, and confine himself to his room. In the case of rheumatic symptoms, his food and drink should be of the weakest and lightest kind, and a silk handkerchief should be applied over his face. In the other cases, the face should be wrapped in flannel, and no change made in the food or drink. The tooth should be stopped with lint.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> In the first case it will be the best way to aim at the removal of the cold, by giving a dose of salts, and taking a sweat of weak whey, with a tea∣spoonful of salt petre. After this a small blister applied to the part will be most effectual; or, instead of this, sweating the part with hot herbs, or a hot stone, wrapt in moist or dry rags, may be useful. In general, in such a case it will be of little use to apply any thing to the tooth itself, till the above has been first done, then a little laudanum and spirits may be held in the mouth. In all the other cases, topical applications are more effectual. The chief of these are opium, camphor, oil of cloves and other warm essential oils; with these electricity, burning the tooth, applying a hot iron to the ear, and many other means, have been at times ef∣fectual. But it is often necessary with these to give small doses of laudanum, and apply a blister, and when these fail, extracting the tooth; which may be done at any time, by a careful trusty operator: but if this does not relieve, the pain passing to another tooth, the pa∣tient should not insist upon that being drawn, but commit all to patience. The best manner of applying topicals is to insert the medicine into the hollow, and cover it with lint or wax.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXV.
THE GOUT.</HEAD>
<P>THE causes of the gout, for better comprehending them, may be placed under four heads.</P>
<P N="1">1st. The prime causes; which are the use of excessive quantities of high seasoned animal food, and the libe∣ral use of wine and other spirituous liquors. These are supposed to produce their effect, by causing an ac∣tion in the extreme vessels (which are employed in nu∣trition) in degree and constancy, above what they were constructed to bear, so that as soon as the body ceases to yield, which is at the end of growth, the vessels from being over excited, are overcome, and suffer an indirect debility, and relaxation.</P>
<P N="2">2d. The predisposing causes; under which a less de∣gree of the above brings on the complaint, because they aim at the same point: they are, indolence, hereditary delicacy of the parts that suffer in the gout (from a general similarity to the parent) and that tendency in the animal oeconomy which produces a robust and gross habit. These causes would, when they had proceeded to a certain extent, bring on the gout; but it is sel∣dom the case, that it is not helped on by what may be called.</P>
<P N="3">3d. The exciting causes; as venery, debauchery, cold applied to the feet, indigestion, much application of mind, night watching, passions, excessive evacua∣tions, changing of habits, debilitating diseases, bruises or strains of the parts that suffer in gout; the use of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and acid fruits, &amp;c. All these act by debilitating generally or topically, and this being always accompa∣nied with a relaxation, exposes the injured parts to the irritation of the air in an uncommon manner. The irritation of the air brings about</P>
<P N="4">4th. The proximate or immediate cause; which is a superabundant afflux of the nervous, or vital princi∣ple, to the parts most debilitated or most exposed (to
<PB N="45" REF="029891_0044_0FE2C4B933B5BF48"/>the common irritations); usually the extremity of the joints, or ball of the great toe. This afflux of vital principle has two effects. 1st. As there is no sen∣sation without the presence of this principle, so in the abundance of it, the sensation is exquisite. 2dly. As there is no circulation without it, and the circulation is in proportion to it, so, in the abundance of it, the circulation is increased to inflammation, and the tender parts are forced, and filled faster than they can propel the blood; hence congestion, redness and pain of the joint, and in such parts as are not plentifully furnished with vessels, the muscular fibres are contracted to a spasm.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="symptoms">
<HEAD>THE SYMPTOMS OF THE REGULAR GOUT.</HEAD>
<P>A CEASING of the sweat to which the feet have been accustomed, an unusual coldness of the legs and feet, a frequent numbness, alternating with a prick∣ling sensation all along the course of the extremities, frequent cramps of the legs, and a swelling of the veins. Whilst these symptoms take place in the parts mentioned, the whole body is affected with a degree of torpor and languor: the functions of the stomach in particular are more or less disturbed, the appetite is diminished, and flatulency with other symptoms of in∣digestion felt. These symptoms take place for some days before the fit of the gout comes on, but often on the day preceding the fit the appetite becomes great∣er than usual: The fit usually begins about three o' clock in the morning, with pain affecting one foot, most commonly at the ball of the great toe, but some∣times in other parts of the foot; with the coming on of the pain there is usually more or less of a cold shivering, which as the pain increases gradually gives way to beat and fever, which lasts as long as the pain does. From the first attack the pain becomes more violent till the next midnight, after which it gradually remits, and after continuing about twenty-four hours usually ceases, with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ating and sleep.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="029891_0045_0FE2C4C0F275BD68"/>The next morning after the remission, a swelling and redness is to be perceived in the part affected, which after continuing some days, gradually abates.</P>
<P>But though the pain ceases at the end of twenty-four hours, it usually returns every evening, with less and less violence and fever, and again abates in the morn∣ing: this recurring continues some days, and then goes off very entirely, till the third, second, or next spring, following. This is the case in the first attack of the gout; but the returns become more frequent, till at length after some years the patient is never clear of it, except a month or so in the summer season: Af∣ter the gout has continued, the pain does not remain in one joint, but shifts about until it has attacked al∣most every joint in the body.</P>
<P>After a fit is over, the patient feels himself recruited in body and mind.</P>
<P>As the gout proceeds, the pains become less severe and more continued, and the other affections are more considerable, so that the stomach is very much affected with sickness.</P>
<P>After the first fits of the gout the joints remain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>upple, but in the advanced state they become stiff and motionless, with earthy concretions.</P>
<P>To those who have suffered much with the gout, a complaint of the kidneys frequently alternates with the gouty affections.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="management">
<HEAD>MANAGEMENT BETWEEN THE FITS.</HEAD>
<P>IF it be early in the complaint, or the patient not debilitated, gentle continued bodily exercise and a diet of vegetables and milk should be used; but if the patient is already much injured by it, neither of the above will be safe. His exercise should then be gestation, for walk∣ing would injure the parts too much, and other exer∣cise would be fatiguing: His diet should be of the most nourishing vegetables, milk and light meats, which last may be used more and in proportion to the debility, and if this be considerable, it will be necessary to use
<PB N="47" REF="029891_0046_0FE2C4C5C7C14678"/>good Madeira, diluted, for drink; otherwise all spi∣rituous liquors should be abstained from. The causes mentioned should as much as possible be avoided, and the patient should keep his bowels regular with a little sulphur, castor oil, lenitive electuary, or any mild opening medicine; which are to be used at all times to prevent or remove the costiveness.</P>
<P>In general, it will be found useful after a fit not to rise soon, but to keep warm in bed most of the morn∣ing, and to go to bed early.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="treatment">
<HEAD>TREATMENT IN THE FIT.</HEAD>
<P>AT this time very little can be done to advantage. If the patient is vigorous, and the inflammation and pain considerable, blood-letting may be once perform∣ed, though sparingly. Scarce any thing solid should be taken for diet, and when the patient has suffered much from want of rest, fifteen drops of laudanum in one tea-spoonful of spirits of nitre dulcified, may be taken at night. Applying poultices of bread and milk to the parts, will sometimes give ease to a small extent, and in a violent case may be tried; carded wool should always be applied.</P>
<P>When the inflammation has gone off, and a stiffness remains, it will be of service to use the flesh-brush to rub the parts with, and after the fit to take regularly some of the preparations of steel, mentioned hereafter.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="treatment">
<HEAD>OF THE ATONIC GOUT, OR GOUT OF THE STOMACH.</HEAD>
<P>IN such patients as have brought the gout on them∣selves, this peculiarity seldom happens till late in the disorder, when the system is generally debilitated, and there is little disposition to inflammation. In such a state the stomach is usually much debilitated, and lia∣ble to be acted upon by a slighter cause than what would bring on an affection of a joint.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="029891_0047_0FE2C4CD9E43C1C8"/>From the above circumstances of debility, general and topical as well as from the stomach being defend∣ed from the application of the common air (which produces the re-action, or inflammation in the regular gout) it happens that the gout of the stomach is a ve∣ry different affection from the regular gout; being a case of deficient and irregular action of the part, in∣stead of an inflammation and excessive action as in the regular; and hence requiring very different remedies.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> Loss of appetite, indigestion, flatulen∣cy, nausea and vomiting, acid eructations, pains and cramps in different parts, which yield upon the dis∣charge of wind; costiveness, though sometimes loose∣ness, colic pains and hypochondriac symptoms (which consists in a great attention to the slightest symptoms, and an apprehension of danger) an absence of inflam∣matory affections of the joints, and of fever.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient's food should be a mix∣ture of animal and vegetable, of the most nutrient and digestible kind, taken rather at many times than in large quantities. Wine and water, or spirit and wa∣ter should be his drink: It will be of great advantage to keep close to the bed, except when the patient is able, and the weather good, then he should ride in a carriage daily.</P>
<P><HI>Treatment.</HI> Fifteen grains of rust of steel, with as much pounded orange-peel, may be taken with mint water, or a little spirit of lavender, four or five times a-day.</P>
<P>A tea-spoonful of saline aromatic spirit will also be of service to take a few times a-day.</P>
<P>If indigestion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> much, fourteen grains of ipe∣cacuana may be given every five or six days, or large draughts of strong camomile tea, which will frequently have the same effect.</P>
<P>A third variety of the gout is, when the inflamma∣tion has appeared first in its usual place (the joints) but from improper treatment, bad management, expo∣sure, and other less observable causes, it leaves the joints, and fixes upon the stomach or some other part.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="029891_0048_0FE2C4D25916DA00"/>This is called the RETROCEDENT GOUT. When the stomach receives the affection, a great anxiety, sick∣ness and vomiting attend; if the lungs, an asthmatic affection is the product; if the heart, fainting; if the head, an apoplexy.</P>
<P>When the stomach or bowels are attacked, wine, with spices boiled in it, should be given plentifully, or if this is not sufficient, spirits with spices in large doses. In slighter cases, less doses of spirits, in which garlic has been steeped, may be given; with this the pa∣tient's feet may be steeped in a strong hot mixture of spirits and water, and blisters laid on the ankles; vola∣tile aromatic spirits, and assafoetida, are also proper to be given, but they are less powerful than spirits and spices. When the vomiting is troublesome, it may be encouraged with camomile tea, and afterwards restrain∣ed by twenty or thirty drops of laudanum with a drachm, of spirits of nitre dulcified; vitriolic aether and musk are sometimes useful.</P>
<P>When any of the other parts are affected, a blister should be immediately applied, and the bath of spirits and water applied to the feet. If the patient is able to bear bleeding, it should be performed when the head or lungs are affected. In all cases a gentle de∣termination to the surface should be aimed at, by giving one tea-spoonful of saline aromatic spirits every two hours; or spirits of nitre dulcified and laudanum every two or three hours. The fourth and last variety of the gout is the MISPLACED. That is, when the pa∣tient, instead of a regular affection, is immediately (without any preceding affection of the joints) affect∣ed with an inflammation of the lungs, the bladder, or the lower end of the last gut; in this last it brings on the piles: when it affects the bladder, it brings on strangury or a difficult discharge of urine. These af∣fections are to be treated as directed in the chapters for them; remembering the constitution and situation of the patient.</P>
<P>During every species, costiveness should be removed by three or four grains of aloes, or twenty-five of
<PB N="50" REF="029891_0049_0FE2C4DC3AD79D28"/>rhubarb. And between every affection, the system may be strengthened by the following medicine; half a wine-glass full of which may be taken twice a day, at eleven and at four o'clock; port wine, one quart, rusty iron or iron flakes, one handful, cinnamon one ounce: let them remain one week and then use them.</P>
<P><HI>Observations.</HI> 1st, It appears, that a primary gout is the consequence of a general injury done to the sys∣tem; but that the stomach and extremities suffer chief∣ly, because the stomach is particularly injured by the prime causes, and the extremities are more exposed (from their distance from the heart and other causes) to the irritation of the air, which far exceeds common notice and opinion.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, It is also plain, that those who are much pre∣disposed to the gout by hereditary constitution of the parts, cannot possibly escape it; because that quanti∣ty of food which is necessary for nutrition, will pro∣duce an action, that the vessels usually injured in the gout cannot support through life.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, A fit of the gout is a change in the system, which aims at a removal of the injury; only being unbounded and excessive, not produced by any inter∣nal conscientious power, but by physical laws.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVI.
THE SMALL POX.</HEAD>
<P>THE small pox is of two kinds; the distinct and the confluent: As they demand a very different treatment, I shall not confound them, but treat of them separately.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>THE DISTINCT SMALL POX.</HEAD>
<P>THE cause of this is a specific contagion.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> About eight days after inoculation, and probably the same time after taking it the natural
<PB N="51" REF="029891_0050_0FE2C4E0DCB49648"/>way, a fever appears of the continued inflammatory kind: after this has continued about three days, a distinct eruption of small pimples, like flea-bites, ap∣pear on the face; these increase and extend, so that about the end of the fifth day, the eruption is com∣pleted and extended to the extremities: from the first eruption the fever usually declines, and at the finishing of the eruption it ceases. During the fever, children are frequently affected with starting, and if kept warm, with fits.</P>
<P>About the eighth day after the eruption, these pim∣ples have increased to spheroidal pustules, filled with matter, with a red margin around each.</P>
<P>Before the pustules are quite filled, a swelling of the face takes place, which subsides as soon as the pustules are filled: a swelling of the wrists and feet succeeds the above, just in the progression of the eruption; during this period a sore throat is common.</P>
<P>After the pustules are fully ripe and yellow, they then either pour out the matter, from a small rupture at their top, or the matter is absorbed, leaving en emp∣ty flat bag: the former is usually the case with those on the face; the latter with those on the arms and thighs: in this way they decline till they are perfect∣ly dried up, which takes place, from eight to sixteen days (from the time they begin to decline) according to size and number of the pustules: pits are fre∣quently left behind.</P>
<P><HI>Management</HI> The patient should be kept cool, both by going into the air, and thinning his cloathing: However, the custom of exposing to bad weather; ex∣treme cold, and pulling off from children the flannels which they have been long used to, has occasioned the worst consequences: a medium therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to ob∣served. Those who are in a good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of health should live chiefly on vegetables, what meat they do use, should by all means be fresh; but those who are weakly should not alter their food, so as to weaken themselves, but only choose such as they always should, viz. digestable mild food. This should be the ma∣nagement
<PB N="52" REF="029891_0051_0FE2C4E8A2C1E360"/>until the fever commences, when they should use nothing but light spoon aliments, such as barley, gruel, panada, custard, jelly, &amp;c. Spirituous drinks should be altogether avoided; at the time of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such drinks as the following may be taken more or less, in proportion to the height of the fever, viz. lemonade, cream of tartar dissolved in water, and sweet∣ened, jelly and water, apple-tea, made by pouring boiling water on undressed, red-streaked apples, sliced very thin; the drink to be sweetened; these drinks, abstinence, and vegetable food, with the directions for keeping the patient cool, may be observed until the number of pocks and favour of the disease be deter∣mined, after which they may be gradually relinquish∣ed; the exposure first, and then the others, and the proper habits returned to.</P>
<P>The first week in May is probably the best time for inoculation, in the States of Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland; farther Southward, April; farther Northward, the latter end of May: but avaricious aims have been the cause of adopting an earlier season. It is upon the whole, in large towns, safest to inocu∣late before teething, but only because of the danger of taking it the natural way; where that is not to be feared, then from the fifth to the twelfth year, is far preferable; if any thing be amiss, we can then stand some chance of rectifying it, by suitable treatment, but with infants we can only deplore their state, when the com∣plaint takes an unfavourable turn.</P>
<P><HI>Treatment.</HI> To those who are pretty hearty, or of a full habit, between the time of inoculation and fever, two doses of Glauber salts, or cream of tartar, suffi∣cient to procure four or five stools and not more, may be given: but to those who are lean or weakly, no purgatives should be given, only costiveness should be removed by a little cream of tartar, or the pills No. 6. If they have not a passage every day, this will be necessary; or if they have a passage every day, and the stools should be hard and difficultly passed, the pills, or a clyster of oil, sugar, milk and a little
<PB N="53" REF="029891_0052_0FE2C4ED477312F0"/>scraped Castile soap, which is probably the best, is to be given.</P>
<P>If at the commencement of the fever, the patient feels much oppression at the stomach, uneasiness and giddiness, it will be proper to administer an emetic of two grains of tartar emetic, dissolved in a cup of warm water, or of ten grains of ipecacuana; at the same time he should have fresh air: when the fever has com∣menced, if it runs high, it will be proper to give a dose of salts, which may be taken at two or three por∣tions: If this does not lessen the fever, take four grains of tartar emetic, and put them into a quart of apple or other tea; three table-spoonfuls of this to be given every hour, till the eruption appears, keeping him cool withal. If the eruption appears numerous, and the pulse be usually strong, a dose of salts will be of use, as it will bring many of the pimples to nothing; after this nothing more will be necessary, but to keep the bowels regular with small doses of any mild medi∣cine.</P>
<P>When the pocks have dried away, if any sore or un∣dulatory motion of the muscles take place, a few pills of the following form may be given: calomel twelve grains, opium three grains, honey enough to form them into twelve pills, one of which may be taken night and morning.</P>
<P>If the arm inflames much, pour cold water on it daily, for ten minutes together.</P>
<P>N. B. All the above prescriptions of medicine are for grown persons.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>THE CONFLUENT SMALL POX.</HEAD>
<P><HI>SYMPTOMS.</HI> In this the fever is more violent than in the former, the pulse being quicker and more contracted; a disposition to coma, or a d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ep drowsi∣ness, is almost always present with the incipient fever, and a delirium is a frequent symptom: infants are fre∣quently attacked with fits in the first days; vomiting is here a common symptom: early in the third day,
<PB N="54" REF="029891_0053_0FE2C4F585DEB750"/>the pimples break out in clusters, and these are fre∣quently preceded or accompanied with an efflorescence like St. Anthony's fire.</P>
<P>When the eruption is completed, it is found to be much more numerous in the face than on the body: the pocks are less eminent: at the end of the eruption the fever does not go off, but only remits, to increase with more violence, when the pocks have acquired their summit; this is called the secondary fever: The pimples soon turn to vesicles filled with whitish or brown water, instead of yellow matter, as in the distinct: the pocks are very irregular, and run into one another in many places<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so as to form one large flat pock, cover∣ing almost the whole face; wherever there is any space between them, it is not florid, but pale and shrivelled.</P>
<P>The swelling of the face, that sometimes attends the distinct, is here always present at an earlier period, and rises to a greater height; the discharge of saliva is generally great about the same time; both subside about the tenth or eleventh day, counting from the attack of the incipient fever. With infants a lax is common instead of a salination.</P>
<P>The pocks over the body, though distinct, are ge∣nerally flat, and upon the whole, there is a great ten∣dency to putrefaction.</P>
<P>The <HI>management</HI> of this should be much the same as that directed for the distinct, except that towards the latter end, when the patient grows weak, and symp∣toms of putridity prevail, then the patient should have for drink, sixty drops of elixir of vitriol, to one pint of spirits and water, or wine and water, and a moderate de∣gree of warmth should be kept up. Great attention should be given to keep the room clean, sweet and ventilated, as directed for the putrid fever.</P>
<P><HI>Treatment.</HI> When the symptoms appear as laid down, with considerable fever; give one sixth of a grain of tartar emetic in apple-tea, or common drink of any kind, every hour. From the fifth day <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The day is always reckoned from the attack of the incipi∣ent fever.</NOTE> on∣ward,
<PB N="55" REF="029891_0054_0FE2C4FA2269D850"/>till the eruption be compleated, give twenty drops of laudanum, every morning and night, taking care to remove the costiveness it occasions, by giving cream of tartar, or castor oil daily, if necessary. When the secondary fever comes on, the same treatment with tartar emetic and laudanum should be used, until the symptoms of putrefaction and weak pulse take place, then all should be dropped, for bark and port wine, which may be given every hour, so that the patient may take a pint of wine and one ounce of bark, from morning till bed time.</P>
<P>From the eighth day to the eleventh, when the fe∣ver is violent, blisters should be laid on successively, without any respect to the pocks; the wrists, thighs, back of the neck, and breast, are proper places; when the swelling in the throat threatens suffocation, a blister should be applied over the throat, and the throat gar∣gled with a mixture of one drachm of elixir of vitriol, to half a pint of sage tea and a little honey; or in∣stead of this, with vinegar and water.</P>
<P>If the fits, that usually attack children, happen but once or twice, nothing need be done but to keep them cool; but if they are frequent, they are likely to destroy the patient; then as large a dose of laudanum as the child can take, should be given.</P>
<P>The bark, with the vitriol and water should be con∣tinued for a considerable time after the disease, to strengthen the system, though it should be used in a less quantity.</P>

THE CHICKEN POX.</HEAD>
<P>THIS disorder appears to arise from a specific con∣tagion in the air: like the small pox, it never returns.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> The patient is generally, for one or two nights, or nights and days, affected with fever, which most always is slight: at no certain person, though perhaps always before the third day, the pocks appear
<PB N="56" REF="029891_0055_0FE2C502E961E328"/>on the face, and over the body; they are never very numerous, though sometimes pretty large. In the course of four days they are at their summit, when they are about the size of a large brister shot, and much of the same form, filled with yellowish or white water. They sometimes come out successively instead of a great many at once.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient should be kept cool, espe∣cially when in bed; light vegetable food, and cooling acid drinks, should be used.</P>
<P><HI>Treatment.</HI> If the fever be worthy attention, the bowels should be opened with a dose of cream of tar∣tar or of salts, every day till it ceases, and the acid drinks given plentifully.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVIII.
THE MEASLES.</HEAD>
<P>THIS disorder arises from specific contagion, and never has been known to attack the same person twice.</P>
<P>It usually makes its appearance about January, and again ceases at midsummer. Nevertheless, it is not al∣together adherent to any particular times, for it con∣tinues throughout the year, though less extensively.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> It comes on like a common fever, with a cold stage succeeded by a hot one; a nausea, anxiety and vomiting, are pretty generally attendants. Some∣times at the beginning, the fever is sharp and violent, but before the eruption it is most generally so, which happens about the fourth day; with these a hoarse∣ness, cough, difficult breathing, swelling of the eye∣lids, acrid discharge from the eyes and nose, with sneezing take place: generally a drowsiness attends the beginning. The eruption appears first on the face in small points like flea-bites, which soon may be ob∣served by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ut or feeling, in clusters, spreading them∣selves over the whole body; the face appears a little
<PB N="57" REF="029891_0056_0FE2C507880D4780"/>turgid during the first two days of the eruption, after this, the eruption changes its colour from a scarlet to a brown, and soon goes off very entirely, leaving <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> scurf. The fever sometimes goes off, when this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣squamation takes place, but more commonly continues with the cough for some time after the disorder has gone through the stages, and not unfrequently the cough and difficulty of breathing increase towards the end, so as to mark an inflammation of the lungs. Af∣ter the desquamation, a lax or sweating usually takes place, and continues for some time.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient should avoid heat, but on the other hand, should not expose himself so much to the cool air, as in the small pox. He should live on a low vegetable diet, and cool acid demulcent drinks, such as flaxseed tea, with lemon juice: barley water boiled with prunes, is also very good, especially for the cough.</P>
<P><HI>Treatment.</HI> If the fever that precedes the eruption is considerable, it will, in adult patients, be proper to bleed, but in children, a purge or two of salts will be generally sufficient. From the beginning, the drinks mentioned above and syrups may be given to allay the cough; but these are seldom sufficient; it will therefore be necessary, from the time of the eruption, to give one tea-spoonful of paregoric, twice a-day, and two at night in common drink. This treatment and keeping the bowels open regularly, with gentle me∣dicine, as salts and manna, in small doses, cream of tartar, castor oil, &amp;c. should be continued in. When the desquamation or peeling of the skin takes place, if the difficulty of breathing mentioned in the desorp∣tion, comes on, with a strong pulse; then the patient should be bled freely, and a blister laid afterwards on the side, as in a pleurisy, and with these, one of the powders No. 1. may be given every two hours, or if it be a child, a sufficient quantity of antimonial wine, to be taken at intervals of two hours: during such a state the paregoric should be omitted. If the patient, is unable to bear bleeding, the case then cannot be ve∣ry
<PB N="58" REF="029891_0057_0FE2C5109FB5C858"/>violent; then purging and blistering with the pow∣ders may be used; gentle riding and bark are proper <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> restore the patient when much reduced.</P>

THE SCARLET FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>THIS complaint cannot possibly be separated from the putrid sore throat, as the affection of the throat, eruption of the skin, and low or putrid fever, which are the chief symptoms, are attendants on both: added to this, the same contagion will affect one per∣son with what is judged to be the putrid sore throat, and another with the scarlatina. It is therefore pro∣bable that the scarlatina is only an affection of less magnitude, sometimes owing to the lenity of the ge∣neral contagion, and then causing scarlatina universal∣ly, and at other times owing to the diversity of con∣stitutions attacked. Hence, for the cure, &amp;c. I refer to what I have said of the putrid sore throat, Chap. xi. But it frequently happens that the scarlati∣na is so slight as to shew no putrid symptoms but ra∣ther inflammatory; then all that will be required will be a blister to the throat and keeping the bowels open with cream of tartar.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="30" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXX.
St. ANTHONY's FIRE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAUSES.</HI> A hereditary disposition thereto, or a peculiar delicacy of the membrane that suffers the inflammation; passions of the mind, a sudden cooling of the body after being heated by the sun, spirituous liquors taken freely, hot drinks or hot baths, checked evacuations, moist air, and perspiration any how stop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, generally excite the disease in those predisposed.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="029891_0058_0FE2C515539FD1A8"/><HI>Symptoms.</HI> It commonly comes on with shivering and succeeding heat with fever; the pulse is general∣ly quick, sometimes hard and full; a confusion of the head and some degree of delirium frequently attend, but a drowsiness almost always, which sometimes in∣creases to a comatose state. After these symptoms have continued from one to three days, a redness most commonly on the face appears, which increases with a swelling, that turns white, upon pressing it with the finger. This goes on to increase, though it com∣monly abates in one part a little, to increase in ano∣ther; in this manner it sometimes extends all over the head, and swells the eye-lids, so as to produce tempo∣rary blindness.</P>
<P>It is not an uncommon case for blisters to arise on the swelling, filled with yellow or whitish serum, which break after awhile, and leave the part underneath blackish, and very ready to turn gangrenous; the skin between these blisters peels off; matter is sometimes discharged from the eyelids: the inflammation and fe∣ver usually continue about ten days, and then go off; when the fever goes on violently, and the inflammati∣on extends, it is apt to produce an apoplexy.</P>
<P>These are the symptoms of a perfect disease, but slighter affections are not unfrequent, even with little or no fever.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient should be kept cool, in proportion to the greatness of the fever: acid drinks and vegetable diet should be used throughout.</P>
<P><HI>Treatment.</HI> When the case agrees with what is laid down above, half a pint or more of blood should be taken away, which may be repeated, if the habit al∣low, and the pulse and inflammation require it: after bleeding, cooling purgatives should be administered; one ounce of Glauber salts may be divided into four parts, one of which should be given every two hours, mixing it with lemon juice, which covers the bad taste.</P>
<P>This practice of administering salts may be followed for some days; they not only open the bowels, but
<PB N="60" REF="029891_0059_0FE2C51BAE9F8430"/>temperate the heat and fever: in slighter cases bleed∣ing should be laid aside, and the medicines given as directed.</P>
<P>Whenever there are any symptoms of putrefaction, as a low, weak pulse, dark colouring of the tongue and mouth, acrid and black spots underneath where the blisters stood; then all evacuations (except keep∣ing the bowels regular, with a little rhubarb) should be laid aside, and twelve grains of columbo root given every hour; when this can be kept on the stomach well, and does not have sufficient effect, as much bark should be given, and the dose increased as necessity requires, or as it will fit on the patient: wine and water, and vitriol and water, made by putting two tea-spoonfuls of elixir of vitriol to a pint of water, may be drank alternately and freely.</P>
<P>The patient is most always wanting some topical application, for this physicians have thought that meal sprinkled on the part, is the only proper application; this, when the inflammation is considerable, fits agree∣ably, and has some effect in softening the skin, and if sprinkled on very slightly when the blisters discharge, it dries up the humour: however patients are not con∣tent with it, therefore apply either of the following with a rag moistened in it: half a pint of strong tea of camomile flowers, or wormwood tops, fifteen grains of white vitriol, and a tea-spoonful of lau∣danum or a strong solution of allum.</P>
<P>Sometimes from neglect, the part suppurates; then it should be poulticed with bread and milk till it is ripe, when it should be opened and dressed with lint spread with wax and oil melted together; this need only be applied over the sore.</P>
<P>Bark and vitriol, with fresh air, gentle exercise in a carriage in fair weather, will be proper to brace up the habit in the end.</P>

THE ESSERA, OR NETTLE RASH.</HEAD>
<P>THIS generally attacks those of a delicate consti∣tution, especially such as have a fine skin, the ex∣cessive irritability of which appears to be a cause of the disease.</P>
<P>From the above it would appear, that women and children are the chief subjects of it; which is agree∣able to observation.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> It usually comes on in the night, pro∣ducing great restlessness and itching. In the morning considerable red eminences are to be observed on some parts of the body, usually about the upper arms, neck, and breast; their forms are irregular, some being like the stroke of a whip, others like the sting of a mosque∣to. It is not unfrequent for them to disappear in the course of the day, and return again at night: the time of continuance is various, as they sometimes continue for a week, and sometimes for a year or more.</P>
<P>They have never been known to have any dangerous effect; the itching being all that is disagreeable, which at times is so troublesome as to prevent sleep.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient should use exercise, bathing, and every proper means to remove such a de∣licacy of constitution.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> This has been too little attended to, or per∣haps we should ere this, have discovered some simple medicine that would remove it.</P>
<P>I have seen mercury recommended, and in a few cases which I have treated, it was always attended with success.</P>
<P>Twelve grains of calomel, and as many of sulphur of antimony, may be made into a dozen p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s, one of which may be taken for six nights following, after which they may be used only twice a-week; if the pa∣tient's gums become sore, they should be omitted:
<PB N="62" REF="029891_0061_0FE2C526773D6350"/>AEthiops mineral is also a proper medicine, twenty grains may be used every other night for twenty days.</P>
<P>Perhaps if common sulphur was tried every night, it would have an equally good effect. To guard against the returns of it, bark may be used; and some weeks after using the medicines prescribed, the cold bath.</P>

BLEEDING AT THE NOSE.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH this complaint attends at any age and may trouble any constitution, yet it does not make the disorder I mean to treat of, except when it attacks young people, and especially those who are full of blood.</P>
<P>The animal oeconomy finds it proper not to increase the different parts equally from the time of conception, but increases certain parts successively, this increase is brought about by a determination of blood to these parts: hence the different periods of life, that we see fluxes of blood making their appearance may be easily accounted for: and hence this complaint in the youth∣ful, and the following complaint immediately after that period.</P>
<P>It requires attention, or it will soon be accompani∣ed with very disagreeable circumstances.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> A head-ach, redness of the eyes, florid countenance, and throbbing of the temporal arteries, usually precede for a while before the effusion, but im∣mediately before it a fulness of the face, and itching at the nose take place: beside these, frequently more ge∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>toms are observable; as costiveness, pale <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the feet, and shivering<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this is a de∣scription which suits the most perfect state of the complaint.</P>
<P>The quantity of blood discharged is various.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> In the time the bleeding comes on the patient should be placed in a stream of cool air,
<PB N="63" REF="029891_0062_0FE2C52C292CB9C8"/>and be supported erect; he should avoid talking, or blowing his nose.</P>
<P>In the intervals he should avoid heat, stooping his head, or walking fast, more especially after eating: his exercise should be gentle and constant, and this may be partly in riding and walking, and partly in the oc∣cupation of his business, if that be mechanical. The cold bath may be used daily, in which he may remain some time; this has, beside a bracing property, a tendency to make the patient lean: a little care should be used in the beginning; no cap should be worn on the head to keep the water from that part. He should live upon a vegetable diet chiefly, and use cold water for his constant drink.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> In beginning to treat the patient, if he has not already lost much blood, a few ounces may be tak∣en from him, a little before the time of the bleeding's coming on, and ever afterward a dose of salts may be used at the same time; and it may be observed in gene∣ral, that it will be necessary to keep the bowels very regular. If after the salts have been taken, the dispo∣sition is not removed, one of the fever powders, No. 1. may be used every two hours, for two days, and large quantities of lemon-juice taken between each dose.</P>
<P>When the bleeding comes on, it may be suffered to continue till six ounces have been discharged, provided the patient be full of blood, but if otherwise, it should be stopped immediately, by pouring cold water on his head, hands and testicles, and by drinking cold water; at the same time, using dossils of lint, dip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> a strong solution of allum and water, or in any common astringent, and applied up the nose; a piece of sponge is sometimes of service; a weak solution of bluestone has sometimes stopped the bleeding, after other things have failed. But in many cases neither of the above will answer, then the patient's life is in danger, and the following simple method may be used by any com∣mon person, who has the least degree of presence of mind; take a needleful of silk, wax it and tie to one end of it a dossil of well scraped lint, about as large as
<PB N="64" REF="029891_0063_0FE2C533936BA248"/>a thumb, get a piece of cat-gut string several inches long, grease it a little, push this cat-gut through the bleeding nostril into the mouth, till you observe it come out near the throat, lay hold of it with a pair of narrow pincers or forceps, or in their stead, with a dull pair of scissars, and draw it till you have both ends in your hands; tie a knot in the end that you have drawn through, and to this knot fasten your silk and draw back the cat-gut till you have drawn the dossil of lint against the orifice of the passage that leads into the throat, then you need only stop up the nostril with another dossil of lint, which will shut up the passage altogether, and hinder any more blood from coming out. The hint should be kept in for three or four days.</P>
<P>The cat-gut is only for the purpose of getting the silk through, which is too limber of itself: In push∣ing the cat-gut through, you are not to push it up∣wards, as the nostrils apparently lead, but directly backward, aiming at the upper part of the throat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here it comes out; the nostrils turn at about half an inch after you have pushed it upwards. By the stated returns of this complaint, and the habit of the patient as well as by the quantity, you may easily distinguish it from what is termed, a passive flowing of blood from the nose.</P>
<P>In this complaint, the usual topical applications for the other kind are sufficient; but with this the cold both may be used, which is an effectual remedy, from my own experience; with this or without it, tincture <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> iron, No. 7 may be used.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIII.
SPITTING OF BLOOD.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAUSES.</HI> Besides the predisposition mentioned in the preceding chapter, we may consider, as exciting causes, suppressed evacuations, sudden changes of the
<PB N="65" REF="029891_0064_0FE2C538FB39B288"/>air from heavy to lighter, violent efforts, compression in different parts, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> After some general disorder, as flatulen∣cy, chills, &amp;c. a fulness is often felt about the chest. From the blood being poured out, an irritation is made, to relieve which, the patient hawks or coughs, by which means he discharges a little frothy, reddish, and somewhat saltish spittle; this sensation often re∣turns again, and the spittle is thrown out of a deeper red. In this manner the patient usually discharges the blood for some hours or days, when it ceases for that period. But it sometimes happens, that the rup∣ture is more considerable, and the pure blood is dis∣charged in such quantities, as to excite vomiting; in such a case the patient's life is in immediate danger. A cough usually follows the bleeding, which returns sometimes every week, and so on at every period be∣tween that and a year.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> This should be exactly as described for the preceding disorder, only that the cold bath should not be used, as we have not sufficient experi∣ence to recommend it, and the cold should be here very moderate, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> when it is severe, it determines the blood to the lungs, which is to be avoided.</P>
<P><HI>Treatment.</HI> If the patient be able to bear it, blood should be taken away, though not in profusion. As soon as the bleeding takes place, this should be follow∣ed by a dose of Glauber salts. And ever afterwards when we apprehend from the symptoms before de∣scribed, that the bleeding is about to return, we should anticipate it by the repetition of the salts, which I have seen attended with the best success.</P>
<P>When the bleeding is copious, besides the manage∣ment of exposing the patient to cool air, let him take a tea-spoonful of common salt, and repeat it when ne∣cessary. This has been often effectual, and may be carried in the person's pocket, when repeated small bleedings plague him, or ten grains of allum every hour. In the intervals nitre should be given to reduce and cool the system, ten grains in flaxseed tea, may
<PB N="66" REF="029891_0065_0FE2C5420AEAFBA0"/>be given three or four times a day; after the commo∣tion has ceased, the country air should be used. It is sometimes necessary to take a tea-spoonful of pare∣goric elixir at night, in the morning, and at noon, to quell the cough.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="34" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIV.
CONSUMPTION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAUSES.</HI> A hereditary, natural or acquired debi∣lity of the lungs, may be looked upon as causes of this fatal disorder: under such circumstances, almost any irritation upon those parts will establish the con∣sumption; and it is somewhat doubtful if any cause will do the same, without the predisposition.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> Cough, pain about the breast, spitting of nauseous matter at all times of the day, which is sometimes streaked with blood; a fever which comes in at noon, frequently with shivering, and most al∣ways with coldness, which remits towards the after∣noon, to exacerbate or renew its violence at night, continuing with the other affections, and after awhile being followed in its second fit towards morning with a copious sweat.</P>
<P>The pulse in this fever, which is a hectic, is quick and most generally weak, though in its first attack some degree of hardness is to be felt. The fever is always kindled by taking much food at a time. To∣wards the end of the consumption, a lax takes place which generally carries off the patient.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient should live upon a light digestible diet; milk, vegetables, spoon-meats, pud∣dings, pies, &amp;c. are proper; these should be taken in small quantities at a time, and used the oftener, on that account. The teas and drinks prescribed for fe∣vers, are the proper drinks to be used.</P>
<P>Exercise in a carriage or sailing, are almost indis∣pensably necessary; the country air is so far preferable
<PB N="67" REF="029891_0066_0FE2C546AAD14208"/>to the town, that the former will sometimes alone per∣fect a cure, and the latter resist every means. Cold should be guarded against; and for this as well as other reasons, a flannel shirt should be worn.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> If the patient is not low and thin, he should be bled every week for three or four times, taking away about a quarter of a pint of blood each time, till all signs of increased action or hardness are gone from the pulse; if they give way at the first bleeding no more is to be used. After this, or when this is not allowable, eight grains of ipecacuana should be given every four days, for as many times as they ap∣pear to be beneficial: when this has been done, the patient should take twenty drops of elixir of vitriol, early in the morning, at ten o'clock, and again af∣ter the noon fever has abated and before the even∣ing one has come on. To allay the cough take two ounces of paregoric, two grains of tartar emetic, or when tartar does not agree, two ounces of the spirits of nitre dulcified: two small tea-spoonfuls may be used at night, and half that quantity taken at any time in the day when it is troublesome. When the pain in the breast is considerable, blisters may be used; a se∣ton should be put in the side in the beginning.</P>
<P>The bowels should be kept regular, with small dos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of castor oil, sulphur, magnesia, or cream of tartar.</P>
<P>The above prescriptions, although the best and sim∣plest that can be recommended, frequently fail, and when the disease threatens to resist them, a sea voyage should be recommended as the only refuge.</P>
<P>It is not unfrequent that the consumption is com∣bined with other affections, then we must have regard to these affections, or no cure can be expected. But such cases are so complex, that they require the judg∣ment of an able physician.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXV.
THE PILES.</HEAD>
<P>A LAXITY of the gut affected, natural or ac∣quired, disposes to this complaint, so much that slight causes bring it about.</P>
<P>The following are found to be the usual causes, viz. much walking or riding, costiveness, long continuance in an erect posture, strong purges, suppressed, natu∣ral or artificial evacuations; falling down of the gut, drinking large quantities of watery liquors, grief, ob∣structions of the liver, pregnancy, high living, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> The symptoms of this disease being not always alike, have made some variety and distinction of it. Thus there is the blind piles, when the tumour is not visible; the common piles, when tumours ap∣pear without bleeding; and the bleeding piles, when they discharge blood. However, there are general symptoms which are common to all; as, a pain and swimming in the head, stupor, sick stomach with pains in the bowels and back, which frequently precede, and in some cases a fever also: a sense of fulness and itching are the local symptoms: these are soon reliev∣ed in the bleeding piles, when that takes place, and frequently the establishment of the tumour is attended with an alleviation of the symptoms.</P>
<P>Sometimes blood only comes away with the stools; but at other times a considerable, constant discharge alarms the patient. This affection is apt to return at stated intervals, and to increase.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> All the causes as far as possible are to be avoided, and temperance is strictly to be observed by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ethoric; light vegetable food, and cool acid drinks are proper during the affection. Much atten∣tion should be given to regularity, and especially<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> keeping the bowels in a proper state. In lean pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> a fla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> is often necessary.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="029891_0068_0FE2C5532A076640"/><HI>Cure.</HI> It is frequently the case, that this discharge is salutary, and therefore a doubt arises in the minds of some people, about administering medicines to check it. Hence, whenever the discharge is small, and attended with benefit, nothing need be done to check it; but whenever it is profuse, it then threat∣ens a greater injury than it is likely to relieve; then, as well as when it returns often, it should be check∣ed by applying cloths dipped in cold water or vine∣gar to the neck, hands, thighs, and the part itself: if this does not relieve it, dip a sponge in allum and water, or in a decoction of galls, and apply it to the part, and if necessary, give twelve grains of ipeca∣cuana in a little water immediately. When nothing but tumours are present, and they are painful or large, wash them with the following wash: to half a pint of lead-water add two tea-spoonfuls of lau∣danum.</P>
<P>This may be used three or four times a-day. Open the bowels in all cases with sulphur, or sulphur and cream of tartar, mixed in equal quantities with honey<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> two tea-spoonfuls may be taken every two hours: in flight cases this is frequently sufficient alone.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVI.
IMMODERATE FLOWING OF THE MENSES.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAUSES.</HI> High living, excess in drink and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ne∣ry, shocks from falls, dancing, passions, neglect∣ing abstinence in time of menstruating, inflammatory fevers, other evacuations checked, costiveness, cold applied to the feet, frequent miscarriages, difficult la∣bours, neglecting to nurse, living too warm, drinking much tea or coffee, purging, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> An immoderate flowing is usually preced∣ed by head-ach, giddiness, and difficult breathing, a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ding immediately precedes the discharge, with
<PB N="70" REF="029891_0069_0FE2C55CA6B79F00"/>this also a pain in the back, and feverishness frequently attend.</P>
<P>After a large discharge, a general debility ensues; the pulse becomes weak, the stomach sick, respiration difficult upon the least motion; the feet cold and swoln, especially towards evening, when a fever takes place of the hectic kind. Palpitations, fainting, fear∣fulness, are not uncommon symptoms: the whites fre∣quently follow.</P>
<P>The above symptoms take place more or less, soon∣er or later, according to the profuseness and repetition of the discharge.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The causes of this complaint discover to us, that it may take place in two states of the system, one when it is over-loaded or plethoric, the other when it is debilitated; ech of which require separate ma∣nagement.</P>
<P>In the former case, cold, abstinence, and cool drinks should be used with vegetable diet in the intervals: in the latter, good nourishing food, port wine, and ex∣ercise are to be used. In all cases the causes are to be removed or obviated: motion in time of flowing is to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e strictly avoided.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> In the intervals the management prescribed will be sufficient.</P>
<P>In the period, the patient should be kept cool; ten grains of alum may be given every half hour; sponges dipped in cold vinegar, may be applied to the small of the back, and to the parts, and if this does not answer, ten grains of ipecacuana may be given in a little water; after this give ten drops of elixir of vitriol every hour: to correct the laxity that succeeds, ten grains of rust of iron may be taken four times a-day, and in cases of much debility, the Peruvian bark also.</P>
<P>When the menses return more frequently, or flow more plentifully than natural, the patient should be on her guard, look for the causes, and obviate them.</P>

THE WHITES.</HEAD>
<P><HI>SYMPTOMS.</HI> A discharge of whitish mucus flows instead of the menses, or after them, and continues longer and longer, till it becomes pretty constant.</P>
<P><HI>Treatment.</HI> As when this case takes place, debility is generally present, a nourishing diet may be used, with port wine and water, more or less, in proportion to the debility, and gentle, regular exercise.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> The steel, as recommended above, is one of the best remedies; with this topical applications should be made, with a syringe. Decoctions of Peruvian bark, oak-bark, or galls, are proper.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="38" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVIII.
OBSTRUCTED MENSES.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAUSES.</HI> Cold is one of the most common causes, either when applied to the body during menstrua∣tion, or when it has at a preceding time brought on the complaint called a cold; diseases of much pain or action in other parts, debility, excessive evacuations, low passions of the mind, are also causes.</P>
<P>As the disorder is so well marked, I need not men∣tion the symptoms that ensue in those who have once had the menses, but shall confine myself to the symp∣toms that take place in girls who have never had them although they have passed over the proper time. This is called properly a retention of the menses.</P>
<P>The patient after the age of thirteen, but how long after is uncertain, is affected with a loss of appetite, sluggishness, lassitude and debility; the countenance becomes pale or swarthy, and the body universally flaccid, the legs swell, especially at night, and the bel∣ly sometimes swells also, whilst pains affect the head,
<PB N="72" REF="029891_0071_0FE2C56869428BB8"/>back, and other parts: respiration is generally labo∣rious.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> It is clear, that neither the manage∣ment nor the cure can be conducted on a single plan: In the plethoric, and those who have cold as a cause, low diet should be prescribed, with thin drinks, cool air, and rest: but in those emaciated, nourishing food, wine and exercise should be strenuously enforced.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> In those of the former case, that is, those who are full of blood, or have much remaining strength, perhaps nothing will relieve sooner than blood-letting; with this salts may be used, and if the menses do not return at the usual period, at that very juncture let the patient take four grains of calomel, and as many of aloes, in a little honey, and repeat the dose next night if necessary. Those who are emaciated, or have a retention, should take ten grains of steel every six hours, and a couple of doses of bark daily, till the period arrives; and then, if necessary, take the bo∣luses as directed. A decoction of madder has been often used with success.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="39" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIX.
VOMITING OF BLOOD.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAUSES.</HI> Obstructed menses, and other evacuations suppressed; enlargement of the spleen or liver, ero∣sions of the stomach by poisons, small glass, &amp;c. and violent straining to vomit.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> Some pain about the stomach, anxiety and vomiting of black grumous blood, without cough∣ing.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient who is subject to this should live regularly and abstemiously, and endea∣vour by every means to counteract suh causes as ad∣mit of assistance, and use proper medicines for the same purpose. In time of a discharge, the patient should retire from all close places, into cool and fresh air.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="029891_0072_0FE2C56D0CFAD0A0"/><HI>Cure.</HI> Whatever may be the cause, we are to use the same means to stop an excessive discharge. Besides the treatment mentioned before, we may use gentle astringent medicines, as ten grains of alum dissolved in water every half hour, till the vomiting has ceased some time; after which a decoction of oak bark may be used for some days, in the same quantity, and made in the same manner as the decoction No. 3.</P>
<P>When an enlargement of the spleen or liver is the cause, little hope remains of a cure; but the patient should not neglect to try the Virginia sulphur springs, which are very powerful deobstruents. When sup∣pressed evacuations are the cause, the means directed for them should be administered; when acrids have been taken into the stomach, they should be changed if pos∣sible, by their proper antidotes, or enveloped in some mild mucilage, as mucilage of gum arabic, or in oil, or syrups. When vomiting is the cause, a few drops of laudanum in mint water, will put a stop to it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XL.
DISCHARGE OF BLOOD FROM THE URINARY PASSAGE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAUSES.</HI> The passage of a stone, hard riding, blows on the small of the back, suppression of the piles, acrid medicines, as can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rides taken internally, or absorbed from a blister, or some putrid diseases, as the confluent small pox.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> A quantity of red or coffee coloured blackish urine is discharged, sometimes with pieces of clodded blood, like a worm, sometimes the blood is diffused through the urine, and remains so; at other times, it is deposited in the bottom of the pot; some∣times much pain attends, as when a stone is passing along the ureters, at other times there is none.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient is to be advised to any in a reclined posture, and to avoid all stimulating <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and drinks; the causes are to be removed, before a
<PB N="74" REF="029891_0073_0FE2C5746BF56330"/>cure can be expected. Barley, rice, panada, gruel, puddings, and things of this sort, are to be his nourish∣ment.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> A plenty of mucilaginous drinks are to be used, as barley water, flaxseed tea, mucilage of gum arabic, mallow tea, &amp;c. and if the discharge continues, allum whey may be used. In the case of putrid dis∣eases, vitriol and bark are to be administered freely.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLI.
COLD.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAUSE.</HI> Cold applied partially or generally to the body, especially after an increase of heat.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> It frequently makes its appearance with a difficulty of breathing through the nostrils, a sense of fulness and stoppage there; this is followed with a pain in the forehead, stiffness and redness of the eyes and discharge from the nose. When the affection is any worse, the patient is subject to chills and feverishness, which is considerable towards evening, a hoarseness, sore throat, cough, flying or fixed pains of different parts, and not unfrequently some difficulty of respiring.</P>
<P>The cough in the beginning is usually dry, but as the other Symytoms give way, it becomes moist, more easy, and attended with a discharge of whitish or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l∣low mucus, which is most frequent; this goes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ff at different periods, according to the patient's age, state, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient should confine himself to the house, in a temperate room, and live upon vegeta∣bles and cool acid mucilaginous drinks, as barley wa∣ter or flaxseed tea sweetened and acidulated with lemon juice or vinegar.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> If the feverishness and difficulty of breath∣ing are considerable, bleeding should not be omitted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with or without this, a dose of salts should be taken, after which sweating should be practised: one of the powders No. 1. may be given every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>r, washing it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="75" REF="029891_0074_0FE2C579CA852550"/>drops of antimonial wine, and as many of paregoric every half hour for eight or ten times. The latter is a good medicine to take every night to lull the cough, for this purpose, thirty drops of the wine, and sixty of the elixir may be taken, when the patient is dispos∣ed to rest.</P>
<P>If pains remain in the head, a blister to the temples is the surest relief; if in the limbs, a tea-spoonful of the volatile or simple tincture of guaiacum may be tak∣en two or three times a-day, in a little water- Ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing in good weather, or sailing, is of great service as soon as the patient can go about.</P>

<DIV2 N="42" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XLII.
INFLUENZA.</HEAD>
<P>THE cause of this is a specific contagion, pro∣ceeding from some very general alteration in the air. There is no doubt of its being communicated from one person to another.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> The most common symptoms are those of the common cold described above, attacking a whole town or neighbourhood at once. But that is not its constant form; for sometimes it puts on the appearance of a pleurisy, with a strong pulse, at other times a pain in the side with a weak pulse, whilst in a th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> case it has produced all the symptoms of a low nervous fever.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> This is in general to be directed as in the common cold; but when it has the form of a low fever, wine and water should be the constant drink.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> In some of the most violent cases, especially when the patient's habit has been full, it has been ne∣cessary and useful to bleed, and blister the pained part: this latter need never be neglected, where the pain is fixed. Vomits of ipecacuana, antimonial wine, or ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> are always serviceable, and interrupt the disorder sooner than any other medicine. Gentle s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at∣ing
<PB N="76" REF="029891_0075_0FE2C583D16483C0"/>with whey, and a little antimonial wine is never to be neglected. This is to be used after vomiting, when that is intended.</P>
<P>The bowels should be kept regular by small doses of caster oil, Glauber salts, cream of tartar, or jalap. When the cough is troublesome, syrup of squills may be used, one tea-spoonful every three hours; or what in some cases answers better, the following mixture; paregoric elixir one tea-spoonful, antimonial wine twenty drops; this may be taken twice or three times, in the course of a day. Honey and vinegar boiled to∣gether, spermaceti and loaf sugar, extract of liquo∣rice, &amp;c. are frequently useful to take in the mouth every quarter of an hour.</P>
<P>In the case of a low fever, wine and bark are to be given freely, after giving a gentle dose of ipecacuana. If the stomach refuses bark, elixir of vitriol is to be used in its stead, ten or fifteen drops every hour.</P>
<P>Riding or sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing is here as useful as in the former case.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="43" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XLIII.
FLUX.</HEAD>
<P><HI>SYMPTOMS.</HI> Sometimes a fever makes the at∣tack, at other times the bowels are primarily af∣fected; first, with costiveness and flatulency, then with gripes and frequent painful efforts to stool, when no∣thing of a natural sort is discharged, but slime of a whitish, bloody, or blackish colour, in considerable quantities.</P>
<P>In some few instances a lax has preceded. What∣ever is voided of the natural kind, is generally in small hard balls.</P>
<P>The stomach in general is disordered, and that from the beginning; but it goes off as the complaint proceeds downwards, which it generally does, till all is fixed in the lower end of the last gut, where it produces that
<PB N="77" REF="029891_0076_0FE2C588AE797600"/>troublesome effort of it called tenesmus. The feverish symptoms continue a considerable time, remitting and then acceding again.</P>
<P>Whenever the disease takes a putrid turn, which it is apt to do, it may be known by the foetor and black∣ness of the discharges, a lowness of the pulse and gene∣ral debility.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> Great attention should be paid to cleanliness, by removing the chamber furniture, and shifting the bed clothes often; the patient should live upon digestible vegetables, as rice, barley, &amp;c. and milk preparations, as thickened milk, light puddings, chicken water, and light broths may also be used, if the patient is fond of them. And for drinks, teas, jelly and water, and apple water; which may be taken milk warm.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> To procure regular natural stools, is half the cure; for which purpose, a table-spoonful of cas∣tor oil is to be given every hour, till it produces that effect; this may be repeated every other day, for seve∣ral times, as the patient may require; after this, if the patient is very sick, eight grains of ipecacuana may be given; after which two grains of ipecacuana may be administered every two hours, so as not to in∣terfere with taking the oil, as long as the fever lasts. After the use of these medicines for some time, laudu∣num may be given to relieve the pain, fifteen drops morning and night, mixed up with two grains of ipecacuana.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLIV.
APOPLEXY.</HEAD>
<P>THIS disorder most commonly attacks the aged, such as have large heads, short necks, corpu∣lent habits, and indolent dispositions, who have fed high, and used much strong drink. If, in addition to these, they have had a suppression of any evacua∣tion, as the piles, they can scarce expect to escape an apoplexy.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> Sometimes a head-ach and swimming of the eyes, with other affections of the head precede; at other times, it suddenly attacks the patient as he reclines his head, or makes some effort, with a loss of internal and external sense, an almost total deprivation of voluntary motion. The patient's face often becomes flushed and swoln, his eyes red, his pulse full and slow, his breathing somewhat difficult, with snoring.</P>
<P>The time that this state lasts, is uncertain; some∣times the patient comes to his senses in a few hours, with a vomiting and sweat, at other times he lays days, and frequently never recovers.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient should be laid on a bed with his head raised as high as it conveniently can; his neck cloth should be stripped off, and he should be placed in a cool room. If the fit continues long, a little water may be poured down his throat, if possible, twice or three times a-day; when he is on the reco∣very, his diet should be as light as possible.</P>
<P>There are some cases which may be termed apo∣plexy, which demand treatment only from the surgeon, as when it depends upon a fracture of the skull.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> The patient should be bled as freely as his constitution will allow: this may be done at different
<PB N="79" REF="029891_0078_0FE2C5950E3C12D0"/>times, rather than at once. After bleeding, a clyster of Castile soap, dissolved in water, should be given, one drachm of soap to a pint of water, or instead of that, two table-spoonfuls of antimonial wine in as much water. These may be used every six hours, for several times.</P>
<P>If these do not bring him to himself, a large blister should be applied to the back of his neck, and sina∣pisms made of mustard, vinegar, and crumbs of bread, applied to the soles of his feet. As soon as the pati∣ent is able to swallow a pill, six grains of aloes, and as much soap made into a bolus or pills, should be giv∣en him every day, so as to keep his bowels in regu∣lar motion.</P>
<P>Gentle exercise should soon be used, and increased till the patient is perfectly well: proper exercise and abstinence are the only securities against a return. When the disorder ends in a palsy, which it sometimes does, the cure directed for palsy is to be followed.</P>
<P><HI>Lethargy and Coma,</HI> which are species of this disor∣der, are to be treated in the same way, having respect to the degree of the disorder and the patient's habit, and directing the evacuations in proportion to them.</P>

PALSY.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAUSES.</HI> Compression of a nerve in its origin of course, certain narcotics taken internally, exhala∣tions from lead and arsenic in their preparations, ex∣cessive venery, old age, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> A loss of sensation or ability of motion in the part affected, which is sometimes one half of the patient, as the right side, or from the hips down∣wards; at other times, only a small part is affected, as the hand, the arm, the leg.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> This is to be according to the pati∣ent's habit: If he is full, a low diet is to be used;
<PB N="80" REF="029891_0079_0FE2C59CA0B42970"/>if he is low, a stimulating diet and spirituous drinks should be used. The causes are, if possible, to be removed.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> In full habits it is often necessary to purge with jalap, or aloes, and sometimes even to let blood: when these have been used, and likewise when they have not been necessary, stimulating medicines are to be used. A table-spoonful of mustard-seed may be the first, which will give the patient a gentle vomiting; after this, any of the following may be tried, as they may best suit: from one to two tea-spoonfuls of vola∣tile tincture of guaiacum in water, three times a-day; or ten drops of tincture of cantharides, three times a-day in broth or mucilage; ten drops of spirit of tur∣pentine in honey, three times a-day; infusions of horse∣radish and mustard; electricity; frictions; external applications of spirit of sal ammoniac and oil; appli∣cations of flies, made by putting a lump of blister-plaister to twice as much common wax and oil plaister; and lastly, by drinking the water of Berkley springs, which is probably as effectual as any.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="46" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XLVI.
FAINTING.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAUSES.</HI> Excessive exertions, heat, large evacuati∣ons, excessive passions, as fear, anger, joy, &amp;c. sud∣denly depriving the body of any compression, disten∣sion, or pain, that it has been for some time accustom∣ed to, violent pain, affections of the stomach, disagree∣able smells, sights, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> Sometimes a languor, an anxiety, a gid∣diness and dimness precede; at other times the faint∣ing comes on suddenly; the patient turns pale, sinks away, and appears dead; the pulse being either im∣perceptible, or very low; the breathing in the same state.</P>
<P>A cold sweat often breaks out, and stands in drops upon the patient's forehead, which is as cold as a
<PB N="81" REF="029891_0080_0FE2C5A19B0B89C8"/>corpse. After lying a few minutes in that state, the patient begins to recover, and vomits, or is sick at the stomach.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient should be laid out on a hard bed, in a stream of cool air. If the cause re∣quires attention, it is to be removed as quick as pos∣sible.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> The patient should have his face sprinkled with cold water, and his hands, arms, and legs rub∣bed in the direction of the circulation, that is, towards the heart. Hartshorn should be applied to the nose and temples, and twenty or thirty drops given inter∣nally. As soon as the patient begins to recover, a lit∣tle good wine should be given him, and if much de∣bility remains afterwards, it should be removed by bark.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="47" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XLVII.
DYSPEPSY, OR CONFIRMED INDIGESTION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAUSES.</HI> The large use of coffee, tea, or any warm watery drinks, of tobacco, ardent spirits, opium, bitters, spices, and acids; putrescent food, over-eat∣ing, frequent unnecessary vomiting or purging: some disorders, as intermittent fevers, fluxes, &amp;c. An indo∣lent life, much application of mind, excessive venery, long exposure, without exercise, to cold moist air.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> The great variety of symptoms in this affection together with the causes, is the reason that no two persons are identically alike affected; but ne∣vertheless the general or fundamental symptoms are al∣ways alike; these I shall set down; a loss of appetite, distensions of the stomach with wind, eructations after eating especially, heart-burn, sometimes a vomiting, frequent pains about the stomach, and often a dejected mind.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> Avoid all the causes, use the most di∣gestible meat in small quantities at a time, avoid all
<PB N="82" REF="029891_0081_0FE2C5A95AA4FFC8"/>flatulent vegetables, use wine and water, brandy and water, or porter, if it will fit well on the stomach; use gentle, constant, and varied exercise, taking care to avoid exposure in cold or damp weather.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> This is either palliative or radical; the lat∣ter is not to be expected in a short time, nor at all, unless with great attention.</P>
<P>The palliative consists in removing the present dis∣agreeable feelings from time to time.</P>
<P>The most troublesome symptoms are the wind and acid on the stomach, and the costiveness: for the wind and acid, a little magnesia, chalk or lime-water, with some essence of mint, should be taken occasionally.</P>
<P>For the costiveness, the patient should be provided with a box of pills made with jalap or rhubarb; or with extract of white walnut bark, these may be taken occasionally; riding over agreeble country seats, is one of the most effectual remedies against a dejected mind.</P>
<P>For the radical cure, we are to attempt the removal of the debility in the fibres of the stomach; for which purpose the waters of Berkley springs, or of any cha∣lybeute springs, are the most promising: when these cannot be used, any of the following medicines may be used, as shall best suit. Half a wine glass full three times a day, of the tincture No. 7. or two tea-spoon∣fuls of No. 8. in a little water, or in spirit and water, three times a day; or twelve grains of columbo root three or four times a-day; or a table-spoonful of the tincture of bark, No. 4. three times a-day.</P>

LOCKED JAW.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAUSES.</HI> Sudden application of cold to the body when warm and much relaxed; lacerations of the tendons or nerves of the foot, and of some other parts; exposure of the muscles to the air, after the skin has been taken off by a gangrene or otherwise.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="029891_0082_0FE2C5AE53AE3D10"/><HI>Symptoms.</HI> A stiffness of the lower jaw, and pain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> about the breast and back generally precede, and in∣crease till the jaw becomes firmly closed, and the mus∣cles of the back, or of the fore-parts, are violently con∣stricted, so as to bend the patient into a bow; after this state has continued for some time, he is sezied with convulsions, in which he is generally carried off.</P>
<P><HI>Management,</HI> If any substance is lodged in the parts primarily affected, it should be removed immediately: the patient should be kept warm, and fed upon such food as can be got down. In some cases, it would be advisable to draw a lower tooth, to make a passage for the food; wine and water is the most proper drink.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> It will be proper to remove a toe, or any small part, if that be the place of the wound, and to dress this, or whatever part may be hurt, with a strong suppurating salve, as basilicon (which is composed of rosin and wax, with a sufficiency of oil to soften it) hav∣ing first sprinkled it with red precipitate: or if these things are not to be had, a little warm oil of turpentine.</P>
<P>The patient's bowels should be opened with castor oil, or with jalap, and kept open; after this he should have one drachm of strong mercurial ointment rubbed into his thighs and arms, morning, noon and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, till he spits freely: after this it may be used every other day, so as just to keep up a spitting for a week or more, if the symptoms continue. A pill of one grain of opi¦um may be given frequently to ease the pain. If the patient grows weak, he should take the bark as fre∣quently as he possibly can, and in as great quantities as his stomach will bear, without raising his pulse too much. It will be proper to continue the medicines in smaller quantities, for some time after the affection has gone off.</P>
<P>IF the sore is brought in the beginning to suppurate, the locked Jaw need not be feared.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLIX.
EPILEPSY, OR COMMON FITS.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAUSES.</HI> Wounds, and bony protuberan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s of the skull; ossification of the membranes of the brain; acrimony of the fluids from contagion, degeneracy, &amp;c. passions, as anger, fear; strong imagination of disagreeable objects, and the sight of such; conges∣tions of blood in the brain, produced by a plethoric state, by long continued sun-heat on the head; by in∣toxication, surfeit, &amp;c. irritations proceeding from worms: teething; splinters in the flesh; fractured bones; stones in the kidney; the matter of ulcers; poisons, &amp;c. and lastly, large evacuations of blood.</P>
<P>It will readily appear, that many of the above caus∣es do not produce fits generally; and hence there must be a predisposition in those, in whom they will occa∣sion them. A predisposition consists either in a great mobility of the muscular system, or in a relaxed state of the vessels of the brain, which allows of their being easily forced beyond their power, and admitting of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="7 letters" DISP="〈7 letters〉"/>tion.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> Sometimes the patient feels indisposed for some time before the attack, with head-ach, gid∣diness, fulness of the head, sluggishness, &amp;c. at other times the fit attacks without warning; the person falls down, and is variously agitated, sometimes one side more than the other; his tongue is often thrust out of his mouth, and by that means is bit almost or quite through: after continuing some minutes in this state, his convulsions cease, and he lies some time in a sleepy state, and then returns to himself, not knowing what has passed.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> It will be proper to hold the patient, so as to keep him from hurting himself, and to put a piece of thick leather between his teeth, to keep him from injuring his tongue. It is seldom or never neces∣sary to prescribe any diet for the patient, except in
<PB N="85" REF="029891_0084_0FE2C5BA9A00EFC8"/>the intervals, when it is to be suited to his state. If fulness is the cause of the fits, or he is of a full habit, a low vegetable diet, with hard exercise, should be used; but for a contrary state, a nourishing diet and constant gentle exercise is to be used. The causes should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>possible be removed by operations or medi∣cines, suited to the cause.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> In full habits, a bleeding will be proper during the fit, or preceding it. However, if they fre∣quently return, it will not do to bleed every time, but give a dose of salts in its stead, at the time the patient expects the return. Besides this, very little can be done, except to adhere strictly to the management directed, and to have an issue put in the back of the neck.</P>
<P>In those of thin habits, when several fits return quickly after one and the other, that is in one day, it will be proper to give twenty drops of laudanum; to have him bathed in warm water, and a warm milk and water clyster injected two or three times a-day. All this may be repeated if necessary, in six or eight hours after.</P>
<P>But the chief thing consists in removing the mobility or irritability mentioned in the cause. For this, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, steel, and the cold bath are proper; they sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> used a long while, with proper exercise and die<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> fits proceeding from some of the above causes, as fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> irritations, the removal of the cause is all that is re∣quired. But it is lamentable, that some of the causes cannot be removed; as that from bony protuberances into the brain, &amp;c. for such there is no remedy. But it is very probable, that the number of fits will be greatly lessened by temperance, and avoiding extremes on ei∣ther hand.</P>

St. VITUS's DANCE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is a convulsive affection, partly under the influence of the will: It affects the patient's leg or arm, or both. It makes him limp along, and in taking a cup of water, or applying it to his mouth, he usually performs some uncommon gestures, carrying it quickly one way and then another, before he gets it to his mouth. It is apt to terminate in palsy. Children from eight to twelve are the subjects of it.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> The patient should live sparingly, and be purged if he is full. Besides this, cold bathing and a vomit of ipecacuana, taken two or three times, will be of service. Sometimes electricity is of service.</P>

<P><HI>CAUSES.</HI> Obstructions in the large blood-vessels, excessive irritability or mobility of the heart, affections of the mind; and excessive evacuations.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient should live on a nourish∣ing diet, if he is weak habitually, or has been weaken∣ed by disorder; much motion, sudden starts, straining, and all exposure should be avoided.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> When it is certain that an obstruction in the large vessels is the cause, there can be no cure expected, only palliative, and that by avoiding all ex∣cess and extremes.</P>
<P>In the other cases, strengthening the habit with bark, steel, wine, and gentle riding, are what wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> prove effectual to remove it; and for a temporary me¦dicine,

ASTHMA.</HEAD>
<P>BY this I do not mean every difficulty of breath∣ing, but only that which returns periodically, de∣pending upon a certain peculiar constitution of the lungs. It usually observes the changes of weather in its returns, and seldom or never goes off entirely.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> It often begins with a tightness across the breast, flatulency, and impediment in respiration, which continues until the patient can scarcely get suf∣ficient breath to live. Sometimes a large quantity of frothy spit is discharged, at other times little or none. Whenever any phlegm is discharged, which the patient generally makes many efforts to do, it is attended with relief.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient should use light food, such as will not produce flatulency; his drink should be of the cooling kind.</P>
<P>He should be in a place where there is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> mission of air, yet not exposed to cold.</P>

<P>The bowels should be immediately opened, and kept open with common clysters.</P>
<P>If much fever attends the asthma, it may be proper to take away some blood, if the patient is sufficiently able to bear it; and also to lay a blister to the back.

HOOPING COUGH.</HEAD>
<P>THIS often begins like a common cold, but pro∣ceeds on till the cough becomes more like a con∣vulsion: the patient's breath is so forced out of his lungs, that it returns with a whizzing or hoop, after which he often pukes, and finds relief. After some time there is a considerable discharge of mucus.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient, if full, should live on a low diet for some time: milk in its various prepara∣tions is proper, and should form the chief of the pa∣tient's diet. Gentle riding is of service in good weather.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> Gentle pukes of ipecacuana, or tartar eme∣tic, should be given every two or three days for seve∣ral times; after which, small doses of antimonial wine every night: the bowels should be kept open with cream of tartar, or jalap. When the cough has con∣tinued for some time, and the patient grows weak, he should take bark daily.</P>

<P>If the stomach does not bear the oil, let the patient take a quarter of an ounce of cream of tartar, and fif∣teen or twenty grains of jalap. The opening medi∣cines should be often repeated in less doses, to prevent a relapse, and remove the costiveness, which the lauda∣num occasions; salts and manna, or manna and senna, are also very good purges.</P>

CHOLERA MORBUS, OR VOMITING AND PURGING OF BILE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS violent disorder happens at the end of sum∣mer, usually after loading the stomach with acid fruits.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> The patient should take large doses of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>momile, or balm, or sage tea, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> sto∣mach; after which he should take ten drops of lauda∣num, in some mint or cinnamon water every half hour, for five or six times if necessary. If this does not have the desired effect, a blister should be laid on the breast, and a large bundle of mint, stewed in wine or spirit, laid over and about it. The patient should be kept as warm as he can, so as not to be disagreeable. Great care should be taken to avoid the night air, and acid fruits, which rather promote the secretion of bile, than correct it when secreted.</P>
<P>This same disorder, with very little variety, is very common to children in large towns. They should be immediately carried out into the country air, without
<PB N="90" REF="029891_0089_0FE2C5D869C04350"/>waiting for an alteration of the disorder, and also dipt in water fresh from the well. For a medicine, they may have, if five years old, thirty drops of laudanum put into half of the mixture, No. 2. One tea-spoonful of this and one of weak mint water, may be taken eve∣ry half hour, for three or four times: the mint as above may be immediately applied to the stomach: but the chief dependance is to be put in port wine, given every hour, and increasing the dose; one tea-spoonful is enough to begin with.

<P><HI>Cure.</HI> To perform this, we should keep up a free perspiration, by giving three times a-day, half a grain of opium, with one grain of ipecacuana: let the pa∣tient lie down for one hour after taking this. After using this prescription for some days, astringents are to be used, as ten or fifteen grains of tormentil root twice a-day, or thirty grains of gum kino twice a-day, or oak bark; made into a decoction, and used in the same quantities as the Peruvian bark, or six grains of allum every two hours.</P>

<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> Some disorder is generally felt in the bel∣ly, which is succeeded by the sensation of a ball rising up till it gets fixed in the throat; with this, the pa∣tient is also wreathed to and fro by convulsions, which cease after some minutes, to return again. In the intervals, the patient sometimes lies in a sleepy state, at other times comes to herself and talks. In this man∣ner they continue for some time.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient should be kept from hurting herself during the fit; her food should be of the lightest kinds. If she is full, nothing but water drinks should be used, but if otherwise, she should have wine and water: exercise is of material consequence to prevent relapses.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> When the patient is of a full habit, or when the affection proceeds from obstructed menses pro∣vided this does not proceed from debility) some blood should be taken away, after which the bowels should be opened with a common clyster. If the convulsions still continue, ten drops of laudanum should be given in some sage tea, or mint water, which may be repeat∣ed three or four times if necessary. In lean pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ts, a tea-spoonful of the tincture of asafoetida given three or four times a-day, is what is generally used; sometimes a small puke of ipecacuana will put an end to the fits.

But if this has been neglected, there is no way left, but to salivate the patient, by rubbing one drachm of mercurial ointment on him every six hours till he spits freely; after which it may be applied every other night, so as to keep up a plentiful spitting for a week or ten days. This, if done in time, will often prevent the affection.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LIX.
DROPSY.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAUSES.</HI> Obstructions of the liver, compression of the blood-vessels from any cause, large evacuations, suppressed natural evacuations, cold and moisture long applied, hard drinking, general debility, particular debility of what is called the lymphatic system, rup∣ture of a lymphatic, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> A suppression of urine, drought, swelling of the belly, or the body in general, which usually re∣tains the impression of the finger; towards the end fe∣vers
<PB N="93" REF="029891_0092_0FE2C5EA5DDD1888"/>come on with a looseness, which puts a period to the patient's miserable life.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient should live upon light di∣gestible food, and observe the greatest regularity: his drink should be wine and water, if he is thin or debili∣tated: gentle exercise should be constantly used.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> It will be very well in the beginning, if the patient's state admits of it, to give two or three small purges, composed of twenty grains of jalap, with a quarter of an ounce of cream of tartar: if this does not answer, we should try medicines that promote the uri∣nary secretion; for which purpose two grains of pow∣dered squills may be given, twice a-day: or half an ounce of cream of tartar dissolved in a quart of water, may be taken in the course of the morning. An infu∣sion of horse-radish and garlic, in spirit, has been some∣times of use; also strong cider, iron flakes, and mus∣tard-seed put together.</P>
<P>From ten to twenty drops of an infusion of tobacco, in a little mint-water, twice a-day, have been used with success: also a tea-spoonful of salt-petre in a little gin, twice a day.</P>
<P>If none of the above medicines have the desired ef∣fect, there is but little chance of a recovery. However, after every thing else has been tried to no purpose, rubbing the belly, when the dropsy affects that part, with warm oil for a long while, every day, before a fire, has proved effectual.</P>
<P>Bitters and steel are always useful, and should be taken with the other medicines, only at another hour.</P>
<P>There is a kind of dropsy, which affects only the ca∣vity of the breast, which is known by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the water makes, when the patient turns over; by its af∣fecting the pulse so as to make it irregular in its strokes; by its affecting the respiration, and disturbing the pa∣tient in the night with a sensation of oppression. It is to be treated as the other dropsies.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LX.
RICKETS.</HEAD>
<P><HI>SYMPTOMS.</HI> It makes its appearance generally between the ninth and twenty-fourth month, in the following manner; the child becomes sedate, and grows lean, whilst the head grows somewhat out of form; the teeth come out slowly, turn black, and fall out: in a little time the child becomes altogether mishapen, some parts growing whilst others pine away: the stools are liquid; and after a considerable time, a fever comes on, which continues till it puts an end to the pitiable object.</P>
<P>But when it is not so bad, the child recovers as he grows, till he recovers all but his shape.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The child should not be kept longer than usual at the breast, he should have a portion of meat for his diet, much tea should be avoided: he should be carried out every day for exercise, when the weather permits, and great attention should be paid to keeping him clean</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> If the weather is not very cold, let the child be dipped every morning in water immediately from the well: give him a tea-spoonful of the tincture No. 7. three or four times a-day, and let him take two or three grains of rhubarb, when costive.</P>
<P>Bark is also a good medicine, if the child can be prevailed on to take it.</P>
<P>If there is much acid on the stomach, give a little crabs eyes, or magnesia.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="61" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. LXI.
JAUNDICE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAUSES.</HI> Concretions of the bile stopping up the dust, tumours, spasms of the gut into which the
<PB N="95" REF="029891_0094_0FE2C5F5A2C79468"/>bile is emptied, as in cholic and obstructions of the liver.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> An universal yellowness which begins in the white of the eyes, whitish stools, and pains about the right side, and sometimes a swelling at the same place.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient should live mostly on vegetables, except when very thin. Gentle exercise should be constantly used; the drink should be wine and water, when in the above state, but if full, no∣thing but water should be used. The patient should carefully avoid cold and moisture.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> A gentle emetic should be tried, and if it is of service, or does not do harm, it should be repeated; this is best suited where there are gall-stones: but if the liver be obstructed, the patient should take one grain of calomel, every night and morning, till his gums feel sore. When much pain attends, twelve or fifteen drops of laudanum may be given twice a-day.</P>
<P>Bitters are often useful; also elixir of vitriol, to forty drops a-day. Soap has sometimes been useful, taken in pills; but the chief dependence is to be put in diet and exercise.</P>
<P>When there is any fever, the saline mixture, No. 2. should be used as there directed.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN man came first out of the hands of the great Creator, clothed in body as well as in soul, with immortality and incor∣ruption, there was no place for physic, or the art of healing. As he knew no sin, so he knew no pain, no sickness, weakness, or bodily disorder. The habitation wherein the angelic mind, the Divinae particula Aurae abode, though originally formed out of the dust of the earth was liable to no decay. It had no seeds of cor∣ruption or dissolution within itself. And there was nothing without to injure it: Heaven and earth and all the hosts of them were mild, be∣nign and friendly to human nature. The entire creation was at peace with man, so long as man was at peace with his Creator. So that well might
<Q>the morning stars sing together, and all the sons of God shout for joy.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. But since man rebelled against the Sove∣reign of heaven and earth, how entirely is the scene changed! The incorruptible frame hath put on corruption, the immortal has put on
<PB N="iv" REF="029891_0102_0FE2C62DA2C3EAE8"/>mortality. The seeds of weakness and pain. of sickness and death, are now lodged in our inmost substance; whence a thousand disorders continually spring, even without the aid of ex∣ternal violence. And how is the number of these increased by every thing round about us! The heavens, the earth, and all things contain∣ed therein, conspire to punish the rebels against their Creator. The sun and moon shed un∣wholesome influences from above; the earth ex∣hales poisonous damps from beneath; the beasts of the field, the birds of the air, the fishes of the sea, are in a state of hostility: the air itself that surrounds us on every side, is replete with the shafts of death: yea, the food we eat, daily saps the foundation of the life which cannot be sustained without it. So has the Lord of all secured the execution of his decree,—
<Q>Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3. But can there nothing be found to lessen those inconveniencies, which cannot be wholly removed? To soften the evils of life, and pre∣vent in part the sickness and pain to which we are continually exposed? Without question there may. One grand preventative of pain and sick∣ness of various kinds, seems intimated by the great Author of nature in the very sentence that intails death upon us:
<Q>In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return to the ground.</Q>
The power of exercise, both to preserve and restore health, is greater than can well be conceived; especially in those who add temperance thereto; who if they do not confine themselves altogether to eat either "bread or the herb of the field" (which God does not require them to do) yet steadily observe both that kind
<PB N="v" REF="029891_0103_0FE2C6337066CAF8"/>and measure of food, which experience shews to be most friendly to strength and health.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is probable, physic, as well as religion, was in the first ages chiefly traditional: every father delivering down to his sons, what he had himself in like manner received, concerning the manner of healing both outward hurts, and the diseases incident to each climate, and the me∣dicines which were of the greatest efficacy for the cure of each disorder. It is certain, this is the method wherein the art of healing is preserv∣ed among the Americans to this day. Their diseases are exceeding few; nor do they often occur, by reason of their continual exercise, and (till of late) universal temperance. But if any are sick, or bit by a serpent, or torn by a wild beast, the fathers immediately tell their children what remedy to apply. And it is rare that the patient suffers long; those medicines being quick, as well as, generally, infallible.</P>
<P N="5">5. Hence it was, perhaps, that the ancients, not only of Greece and Rome, but even of bar∣barous nations, usually assigned physic a divine original. And indeed it was a natural thought, that HE who had taught it to the very beasts and birds, the Cretan Stag, the Egyptian Ibis, could not be wanting to teach man,
<Q>Sanctius his animal, mentisque capacius altae:</Q>
Yea, sometimes even by those meaner creatures: for it was easy to infer, "If this will heal that creature, whose flesh is nearly of the same tex∣ture with mine, then in a parallel case it will heal me." The trial was made: the cure was wrought: and experience and physic grew up together.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="vi" REF="029891_0104_0FE2C638C6EA1C70"/>6. As to the manner of using the medicines here set down, I should advise, As soon as you know your distemper (which is very easy, un∣less in a complication of disorders, and then you would do well to apply to a physician that fears God) <HI>First,</HI> Use the first of the remedies for that disease, which occurs in the ensuing collec∣tion; (unless some other of them be easier to be had, and then it may do just as well). <HI>Secondly,</HI> After a competent time, if it takes no effect, use the second, the third, and so on. I have pur∣posely set down (in most cases) several remedies for each disorder; not only because all are not equally easy to be procured at all times, and in all places: but likewise the medicine that cures one man, will not always cure another of the same distemper. Nor will it cure the sme man at all times. Therefore it was necessary to have a variety. However I have subjoined the letter <HI>(I)</HI> to those medicines which some think infalli∣ble. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Observe all the time the greatest exactness in your regimen or manner of living. Abstain from all mixed, all high-seasoned food. Use plain diet, easy of digestion; and this as sparingly as you can, consistent with ease and strength. Drink only water, if it agrees with your stomach; if not, good, clear small beer. Use as much exercise daily in the open air, as you can without weariness. Sup at six or seven on the lightest food; go to bed early, and rise betimes. To persevere with steadiness in this course, is often more than half the cure. Above all, add to the rest (for it is not labour lost) that old unfashionable medicine, prayer. And have faith in God who
<Q><HI>killeth and maketh alive, who bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="7"><PB N="vii" REF="029891_0105_0FE2C61850ED0DB8"/>7. For the sake of those who desire, through the blessing of God, to retain the health which they have recovered, I have added a few plain, easy rules, chiefly transcribed from Dr. Cheyne.</P>
<P N="1">I. 1. The air we breathe is of great conse∣quence to our health. Those who have been long abroad in easterly or northerly winds, should drink some thin and warm liquor going to bed, or a draught of toast and water.</P>
<P N="2">2. Tender people should have those who lie with them, or are much about them, sound, sweet, and healthy.</P>
<P N="3">3. Every one that would preserve health, should be as clean and sweet as possible in their houses, clothes, and furniture.</P>
<P N="2">II. 1. The great rule of eating and drinking, is, To suit the quality and quantity of the food to the strength of our digestion; to take always such a sort and such a measure of food, as fits light and easy on the stomach.</P>
<P N="2">2. All pickled, or smoked, or salted food, and all high-seasoned, are alone unfit for aliment.</P>
<P N="3">3. Nothing conduces more to health, than abstinence and plain food, with due labour.</P>
<P N="4">4. For studious persons, about eight ounces of animal food, and twelve of vegetable, in twenty four hours, are sufficient.</P>
<P N="5">5. Water, though the wholesomest of all drinks, yet if used largely in time at digestion, is injurious.</P>
<P N="6">6. Strong, and more especially spirituous li∣quors, are a certain, though slow, poison, unless well diluted, and cautiously used.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="viii" REF="029891_0106_0FE2C63CCEE504D0"/>7. Experience shews, there is very seldom any danger in leaving them off all at once; unless in time of particular diseases, as of debility.</P>
<P N="8">8. Strong liquors do not prevent the mischiefs of a surfeit, nor carry it off so safely as water.</P>
<P N="9">9. Malt liquors (except clear small beer, or small ale, of a due age) are exceeding hurtful to tender persons.</P>
<P N="10">10. Coffee and tea are extremely hurtful to persons who have weak nerves.</P>
<P N="3">III 1. All persons should eat very light sup∣pers; and that two or three hours before going to bed.</P>
<P N="2">2. To go to bed about nine, and rise at five, should be a general practice.</P>
<P N="4">IV. 1. A due degree of exercise is indispen∣sably necessary to health and long life.</P>
<P N="2">2. Walking is the best exercise for those who are able to bear it; riding for those who are not. The open air, when the weather is fair contributes much to the benefit of exercise.</P>
<P N="3">3. We may strengthen any weak part of the body by constant exercise. Thus the lungs may be strengthened by moderate speaking; the diges∣tion and the nerves, by riding; the arms and hams, by strongly rubbing them daily.</P>
<P N="4">4. The studious ought to have stated times for exercise, at least two or three hours a-day: the one half of this before dinner, the other before going to bed.</P>
<P N="5">5. They should frequently shave, and fre∣quently wash their feet in cold water.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="ix" REF="029891_0107_0FE2C64226EB6100"/>6. Those who read or write much, should learn to do it chiefly standing; otherwise it will im∣pair their health.</P>
<P N="7">7. The fewer cloathes any one uses, by day or night, the hardier he will be; but the habit must be begun in youth.</P>
<P N="8">8. Exercise, first, should be always on an empty stomach; secondly, should never be con∣tinued to weariness; thirdly, after it, we should take care to cool by degrees: otherwise we shall catch cold.</P>
<P N="9">9. The flesh-brush is a most useful exercise, especially to strengthen any part that is weak.</P>
<P N="10">10. Cold bathing is of great advantage to health: it prevents abundance of diseases. It pro∣motes perspiration, helps the circulation of the blood, and prevents the danger of catching cold. Tender people should pour water upon the head be∣fore they go in, and walk in swiftly. To jump in with the head foremost, is too great a shock to nature. It is best to use it immediately after rising.</P>
<P N="5">V. 1. Costiveness cannot long consist with health. Therefore care should be taken to remove it at the beginning by a gentle medicine; and when it is removed, to prevent its return, by soft, cool, open diet; as of vegetables, acid or sweet.</P>
<P N="2">2. Obstructed perspiration (vulgarly called catching <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old) is one great source of diseases. Whenever there appears the least sign of this, let it be removed by gentle sweats, or purges.</P>
<P N="6">VI. 1. The passions have a greater influence on health, than most people are aware of.</P>
<P N="2">2. All violent and sudden passions dispose to, or actually throw people into, acute diseases.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="x" REF="029891_0108_0FE2C64770FA1600"/>3. The slow and lasting passions, such as grief and hopeless love, bring on chronic diseases, and low fevers.</P>
<P N="4">4. Till the passion which caused the disease, is calmed, medicine is applied in vain.</P>
<P N="5">5. The love of God, as it is the sovereign re∣medy of all miseries, so in particular it effec∣tually prevents all the bodily disorders the pas∣sions introduce, by keeping the passions them∣selves within due bounds. And by the unspeak∣able joy, and perfect calm, serenity, and tran∣quillity it gives the mind, it becomes the most powerful of all the means of health and long life.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE MEMBERS OF THE Methodist Episcopal Church.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends and Brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE grand interests of your souls will ever lie near our hearts; but we cannot be un∣mindful of your bodies: In several parts of this extensive country, the climate, and in others the food, is unwholesome: and frequently, the physicians are few, some of them unskilful, and all of them beyond the reach of your temporal abilities. A few small publications excepted, little has been done by physical books, in order to remove these inconveniencies: and even those have been written in Europe, and do there∣fore partake of the confined ideas of the writers, who could not possibly be fully acquainted with the peculiarities of the various diseases incident to a people that inhabit a country so remote from theirs.</P>
<P>Simple remedies are in general the most safe for simple disorders, and sometimes do wonders under the blessing of God. In this view we present to you now the PRIMITIVE PHYSIC, published by our much honoured friend JOHN WESLEY. But the difference being in many
<PB N="xii" REF="029891_0110_0FE2C651754EFCE8"/>respects great between this country and England, in regard to climate, the constitution of patients, and even the qualities of the same simples,— we saw it necessary for you, to have it revised by physicians practising in this country, who at our request have added cautionary and explan∣atory notes where they were necessary, with some additional receipts suitable to the climate.</P>
<P>In this state we lay the publication before you, and earnestly recommend it to you</P>
<P>As we apply all the profits of our books to charitable purposes, and the promoting the work of God, we think we have some right to intreat you (except in particular cases) to buy only our books, which are recommended by the confer∣ence, and signed with our signatures: and as we intend to print our books in future WITHIN THE STATES, and on a much larger scale than we have hitherto done, we trust we shall be able soon to supply you with as many of the choicest of our publications, as the time and temporal abilities of those of you, who do not live a life of study, will require.</P>
<P>We remain, dear brethren, as ever,</P>

<P>In the first case, take daily half a pint of a decoc∣tion of lignum vitae; boiling an ounce of it in a quart of water for five minutes.</P>
<P>In the latter case, give half a drachm of powdered nitre, in a cup of water-gruel, every five or six hours: in both cases she should sleep on a hard mattrass and be kept cool and quiet. The bowels should be kept re∣gular by a pill of white walnut extract.</P>

<HEAD>2. For an Ague.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An ague is an intermitting fever, each fit of which is pre∣ceded by a cold shivering, and goes off in a sweat.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>Go into the cold bath just before the cold fit.</P>
<P>☞ <HI>Nothing tends more to prolong an ague, than indulg∣ing a lazy indolent disposition. The patient ought therefore between the fits to take as much exercise as he can bear; and to use a light diet, and for common drink, Port wine and water is the most proper.</HI></P>
<P>* When all other means fail, give blue vitriol, from one grain to two grains, in the absence of the fit, and repeat it three or four times in twenty-four hours.</P>
<P>Or, boil yarrow in new milk, till it is tender enough to spread as a plaister. An hour before the cold fit, apply this to the wrists, and let it be on till the hot fit is over. If another fit comes, use a fresh plaister. This often cures a quartan:</P>
<P>* Or, put a tea-spoonful of salt of tartar into a large glass of spring water, and drink it by little and little. Repeat the same dose the next two days, before the time of the fit:</P>
<P>* Or, a large spoonful of powdered camo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow∣ers:</P>
<P>* Or, a tea spoonful of the spirits of hartshorn in a glass of water.</P>
<P>Or, eat a small lemon, rind and all.</P>
<P>* In the hot fit, if violent, take eight or ten drops of laudanum: if costive, with an Anderson's pill.</P>
<P>* Dr. Lind says, an ague is certainly cured by taking from ten to twenty drops of laudanum, with two drachms of syrup of poppies, in any warm liquid, half an hour after the heat begins.</P>
<P>* ☞ <HI>It is proper to take a gentle vomit, and sometimes a purge, before you use any of these medicines. If a vomit is taken two hours before the fit is expected, it generally pre∣vents that fit, and sometimes cures an ague: especially in chil∣dren.—It is also proper to repeat the medicine (whatever it be) about a week after, in order to prevent a relapse. Do
<PB N="15" REF="029891_0113_0FE2C660F90215F0"/>not take any purge soon after.—The daily use of the flesh-brush, and frequent cold bathing, are of great use to pre∣vent relapses.</HI></P>
<P>* Children have been cured by wearing a waist-coat, in which bark was quilted.</P>
<P>[Those fevers which abate their violence at times, that there appears an absence of the fever for a certain period between two fits, are called intermittents, says Galen. The length of the period determines the name, as quotidian, tertian, double tertian, quartan. The spring intermittents seldom need the grand specific remedy, viz. The Peruvian bark, in this climate, as by administering a vomit of twenty grains of ipeca∣cuana, or of eight grains of the former and one of tartar emetic mixed for a grown person, the succeed∣ing heat of the season effects the cure, and often with∣out medicine. The fall intermittents seldom put on a regular form at first in adults, but are generally remit∣ting fevers; but even though they approach nearer to a continual fever, the patient seldom needs bleeding, and perhaps never in regular intermittents. In either case a vomit as before mentioned, the first opportunity in remitting, and two hours before the fit in an inter∣mitting fever, with warm diluting drinks in the time of the fit, and when intermitting regularly, the bark may be applied after the operation of the vomit, and the fit is over. Children generally need only to be purged before the use of the bark, with jalap or rhu∣barb: the dose of these may be thirty grains for a grown person, and half the quantity for one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> years old, and in proportion. After the fever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>∣larly intermits, and the stomach has been cleansed and the body kept open, the Peruvian bark may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> (unless some inflammation or obstruction prevent) Im∣mediately after the fit, two ounces, and often one is ge∣nerally sufficient, thus:—Divide an ounce of powder of the bark into twelve doses; let the sick man or wo∣man take one every two hours between the fits, and continue them after the return of the next; or— <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an ounce of the bark in a pint and a half of wa∣ter
<PB N="16" REF="029891_0114_0FE2C669B7743678"/>gently down to a pint, strain off the liquid, and take a wine-glass full every two hours; or—To an ounce of the bark in powder add four or five spoon∣fuls of proof spirit and a pint of boiling water, let them infuse two or three days; to use as the former.— But it is best in substance when it can be taken.]</P>

<HEAD>3. St. Anthony's Fire.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">St. Anthony's fire is a fever attended with a red and pain∣ful swelling, full of pimples, which afterwards turn into small blisters, on the face or some other part of the body. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>∣er the eruption is, the less danger. Let your diet be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> gruel, or barley-broth, with roasted apples.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>* Take a glass of tar-water warm, in bed, every hour, washing the part with the same.</P>
<P>☞ Tar-water <HI>is made thus.—Put a gallon of cold wa∣ter to a quart of Norway tar. Stir them together with a flat stick for five or six minutes. After it has stood covered for three days, pour off the water clear, bottle and cork it.</HI></P>
<P>Or, take a decoction of elder leaves, as a sweat; applying to the part a cloth dipt in lime water, mixed with a little camphorated spirits of wine.</P>
<P>☞ Lime-water <HI>is made thus.—Infuse a pound of good quick lime in six quarts of spring water for twenty-four hours. Decant and keep it for use.</HI></P>
<P>* Or, take two or three gentle purges.—No acute fever bears repeated purges better than this, especially when it affects the head: meantime boil a handful of sage, two handfuls of elder leaves (or bark) and an ounce of allum in two quarts of forge-water, to a pint. Wash with this every night.—See extract from Dr. Tissot.</P>
<P>If the pulse be low and the spirits sunk, nourishing broths and a little negus may be given to advantage: Pressing the inflammation with greasy ointments, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, &amp;c. is very improper.</P>
<P>Bathing the feet and legs in warm water is servicea∣ble, and often relieves the patient much. In Scotland
<PB N="17" REF="029891_0115_0FE2C66E621A5CA8"/>the common people cover the part with a linen cloth covered with meal.</P>

The Apoplexy.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An apoplexy is a total loss of all sense and voluntary motion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>only attended with a strong pulse, hard breathing and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tting.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>* To prevent, use the cold bath, and drink only water.</P>
<P>In the fit, put a handful of salt into a pint of cold water, and if possible pour it down the throat of the pa∣tient. He will quickly come to himself. So will one who seems dead by a fall. But send for a good phy∣sician immediately.</P>
<P>If the fit be soon after a meal, vomit and bleed.</P>
<P>* A seton in the neck, with low diet, has often pre∣vented a relapse.</P>
<P>* There is a wide difference between the sanguineous and serous apoplexy; the latter is often followed by a palsy.—The former is distinguished by the counte∣nance appearing florid; the face swelled or puffed up; and the blood-vessels, especially about the neck and tem∣ples, are turgid; the pulse beats strong; the eyes are prominent and fixed; and the breathing is difficult, and performed with a snorting. This invades more sud∣denly than the serous apoplexy. Use large bleedings from the arm or neck; bathe the feet in warm water; cupping on the back of the head, with deep scarifica∣tion. The garters should be tied very tight to lessen the motion of the blood from the lower extremities.</P>
<P>* A scruple of nitre may be given in water, every thee or four hours.</P>
<P>* When the patient is so far recovered as to be able to swallow, let him take a strong purge; but if this cannot be effected, a clyster should be thrown up with plenty of fresh butter, and a large spoonful of common salt in it.</P>
<P>In the serous apoplexy, the pulse is not so strong, the countenance is less florid, and not attended with so
<PB N="18" REF="029891_0116_0FE2C67514FD5E08"/>great a difficulty of breathing. Here bleeding is not so necessary, but a vomit of three grains of emetic tar∣tar may be given, and afterwards a purge as before, and a blister applied to the back of the neck.</P>
<P>☞ <HI>This apoplexy is generally preceded by an unusual heaviness, giddiness, and drowsiness.</HI></P>

<P>Take a pint of cold water every morning, washing the head therein immediately after, and using the cold bath once a fortnight:</P>
<P>Or, cut an ounce of stick liquorice into slices. Steep this in a quart of water, four and twenty hours, and use it, when you are worse than usual, as common drink. I have known this give much ease.</P>
<P>Or, half pint of tar-water, twice a day.</P>
<P>Or, live a fortnight on boiled carrots only. It sel∣dom fails:</P>
<P>Or, take from ten to twenty drops of elixir of vitri∣ol, in a glass of water, three or four times a day.</P>
<P>☞ Elixir of vitriol <HI>is made thus.—Drop gradually four ounces of strong oil of vitriol into a pint of spirits of wine, or brandy: let it stand three days, and add to it ginger sliced, half an ounce, and Jamaica pepper, whole, one ounce. In three days more it is fit for use.</HI></P>
<P>Or, into a quart of boiling water, put a tea-spoon∣ful of balsamic aether, receive the steam into the lungs, through a fumigator, twice a day.</P>

<P>Take from three to five grains of ipecacuana every week. Do this, if need be, for a month or six weeks. Five grains usually vomit. In a violent fit, take fif∣teen grains.</P>
<P>In any asthma, the best drink is apple-water; that is, boiling water poured on sliced apples.</P>
<P>The food should be light and easy of digestion. Ripe fruits baked, boiled, or roasted, are very pro∣per; but strong liquors of all kinds, especially beer or ale, are hurtful. If any supper is taken, it should be very light.</P>
<P>* All disorders of the breasts are much relieved by keeping the feet warm, and promoting perspiration. Exercise is also of very great importance; so that the patient should take as much every day, as his strength will bear. Issues are found in general to be of great service.</P>
<P>Dr. Smyth, in his Formulae, recommends mustard-whey as common drink, in the moist asthma; and a decoction of the madder-root to promote spitting.</P>
<P>☞ The decoction <HI>is made thus.—Boil one ounce of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>der, and two drachms of mace, in three pints of water,

<P>The sheding of the teeth is wisely intended, and brought about in a singular manner. Their hardness will not admit of distention like other parts of the body. Hence, after an enlargement of the jaw-bone, the ori∣ginal teeth are no longer able to fill up the cavities of it. They must stand unsupported by each other, and leave spaces between them. Under the first teeth therefore is placed a new set, which by constantly pres∣sing upon their roots, rob them of their nourishment, and finally push them out of their sockets.</P>
