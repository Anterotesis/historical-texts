<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>GENESIS XIV. 14.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>And when Abram heard that his Brother was taken captive, he armed his trained Servants, born in his own House, three Hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE Words teach us, the wise foresight of holy Abram, in training his servants to the use of arms, in a time of pro∣found quiet, when all was peace and serene; left he and all his, should fall an easy prey to the ambition or avarice of his enterprizing neighbours. Here also we perceive the alert∣ness of Abram, when he heard that his brother was taken captive, he immediately arms his servants and takes the field with his little band;
<PB N="4" REF="013276_0005_0F9049E70087D188"/>
in which his pious benevolence to his oppressed kinsman shines; he does not delay or hesitate, but is alive and in action; he not only arms his servants, but pushes forward to Dan. The courage and faith of Abram is not less con∣spicuous, in this enterprize, when we recollect, from our context, that the army, which capti∣vated his kinsman, was now flushed with uninter∣rupted success, in wasting the neighbour coun∣tries, vanquishing five kings in the vale of Sid∣dim; this army was not only numerous, but used to battle and conquest: In this view, Abram's courage and faith equals almost any¦thing on sacred record, in pursuing such an army, with his three hundred and eighteen raw soldiers, however well disciplined; but moved with faith and a desire to defend the rights of human nature, he pursues them to Dan.</P>
<P>Still our context furnishes us with a notable stroke of Abram's conduct, in which he shews his skill and prudence, as a general, in dividing his little band, that they might appear the more formidable, and in attacking them by night, which added surprize and concealed the small∣ness of his numbers; and God crowned this attempt with success, so that he smote and pur∣sued this powerful army, and recovered the spoil and captives out of their hands.</P>
<P>Yet again, Abram is more illustrious in the other part of his conduct, who now being fur∣nished
<PB N="5" REF="013276_0006_0F9049E8505DAAB0"/>
with rich spoils, and revered for his glo∣rious and surprizing victory over these powerful kings, had now an opportunity to set himself up for a king, and enslave his fellow-men in that part of the world; like Nimrod, who, being a mighty hunter, takes the occasion from his skill and success in killing beasts, to set up for a king: But we behold Abram shining in his justice, generosity and mercy to the king of Sodom, in restoring to him both spoil and captives; and his humility shines also in re∣tiring into private life, thereby manifesting his design, in training his servants, to be a defence of human rights, and not a scheme to aggran∣dize or enrich himself. In these parts of his conduct Abram far excels <HI>Alexander,</HI> whose glory rose from his art and success in depriving men of their natural rights: But the glory of the Patriarch Abram, as a victorious general, was his defending and restoring those rights to his fellow-men and brethren.</P>
<P>From this bright and striking example of the illustrious Abram, who is the father and pat∣tern of believers, we see it is lawful and ne∣cessary for Christians to be trained in the use of arms.</P>
<P N="1">I. It appears from the pious and excellent example of this holy Patriarch Abram, as father and pattern of all believers, to the end of the world, that it is lawful for Christians, as his
<PB N="6" REF="013276_0007_0F9049E871698940"/>
children, to learn the art of war and use of arms, for their defence, when the case requires it, as did Abram. Here notice, this use of arms is only lawful from Abram's example, when, like Abram, it serves the defence of human rights, or destroys such who are un∣worthy to live, by reason of their conduct towards God or man; but is not lawful for the purposes of avarice and ambition, by which human rights are swallowed up. This did not Abram.</P>
<P N="2">2. The smile of Providence on this conduct of Abram, in pursuing and smiting these four kings, with his handful of trained servants, gives reason to believe, that this expedition was of God, as it is recorded in another case, <Q>for there fell down many slain, because the war was of God.</Q> I Chron. v. 22.</P>
<P N="3">3. The lawfulness for Christians to learn and improve the art of war, may be fairly collected from the answer of John, the forerunner of Christ, who came to prepare the way for the gospel kingdom: When <Q>the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, and what shall we do? And he said unto them, do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely, and be content with your wages.</Q> Luke iii. 14.</P>
<P>In this answer, the gospel Elias, who came to prepare the way of the Lord, and make
<PB N="7" REF="013276_0008_0F9049E956D07828"/>
his paths straight, does not give the least inti∣mation that the calling of soldiers was unlawful, or that the gospel kingdom, now at hand, would render such an employment useless, or sinful; although such an intimation seems to be unavoidable (in faithfully answering the question proposed) if the art of war, and em∣ployment of soldiers under the gospel were unlawful and sinful. Here the argument is not to be suspected, on the suggestion, that John might either want courage or faithfulness in this answer: The known character of John, as resembling or being the gospel Elias, in his faithful and bold reproofs, refutes this sug∣gestion; and this was manifest, not only in his reproving cruel Herod, but in pointing out to the soldiers the reigning vices, which seem to be entailed on <HI>standing armies,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>violence, false accusation,</HI> and <HI>discontent with wages;</HI> the demonstration of which we have sadly ex∣perienced in this Land. Hence, from John's answer, we may conclude the art of war or business of soldiers is lawful for Christians.</P>
<P N="4">4. The lawfulness of acquiring art in war, by a christian people, may be strictly proved from the nature and reason of things. For if it be in the nature and reason of things lawful for Christians to enjoy their lives, liberties and property, it must be lawful, in the same nature and reason of things, to use the means necessary to defend and preserve these enjoyments; for
<PB N="8" REF="013276_0009_0F9049EA08B6FCD0"/>
to suppose a right to life, liberty and property, and no right to the means necessary for the defence and preservation of the same, is one of the greatest absurdities in nature. Therefore, in the proceeding view of this point, we may surely conclude, it is lawful for Christians to learn and use the art of war, for their own defence and safety, and the defence and safety of others, as the case shall require.</P>
<P>The second thing before us was, to point out the necessity for Christians, or a christian peo∣ple, to be trained in the use of arms.</P>
<P N="1">1. This necessity may be fairly pointed out, by considering the common share Christians have with others in human rights and privileges. It being a part of a reasonable creature, and necessarily belongs to his character as such, to preserve his life, liberty and property, by all lawful means; then all the proper and lawful means for this end, are necessary, for all who share in these common rights of human nature; for nothing is more disagreeable to common sense, then to suppose a right to any thing, as belonging to human nature, or men in general, and yet to suppose it unnecessary to use the proper means to preserve this right. Hence it appears needful for Christians to use the art of war as a part of their natural, and so necessary defence; seeing they lose none of their natural rights by becoming Christians. Now, if any
<PB N="9" REF="013276_0010_0F9049EAC16B24D8"/>
should allow, that it belongs to men, as men, to use all the proper and lawful means to pre∣serve their natural rights, and as such they may use the art of war; but allow not the necessity or propriety for Christians to use this means of self-preservation; this is in effect to deny that the common rights of men are allowed and necessary for Christians; one of the most strange positions ever devised by mortals.</P>
<P N="2">2. The necessity for a christian people to learn the art of war rises into view, when it is considered as the only sure check on designing and ambitious rulers, who are so often attempt∣ing to enslave and oppress those for whose good they are advanced to power and authority, and only can be awed by the evidence that the peo∣ple are used to the art of war, and therefore have it in their power to right themselves, when the case requires it. In this light, the use of arms, kept up and understood among a christian people is necessary and vastly important, as a re∣straint or check on aspiring and wicked rulers: For the best civil constitution in the world will not restrain such rulers, whilst they have nothing to fear from the power of the people: And what power is there in the people for such to fear, without skill in war? Truly none. In this view, the art of war, for a christian people, to preserve their own natural, civil and religious rights, is most necessary and important; without
<PB N="10" REF="013276_0011_0F9049EB8C66AAD8"/>
which they may not reasonably expect to enjoy, or transmit to posterity, their common rights, as a free people; freedom cannot long continue where the authority of the people is lost. All nations and past ages bear witness to this truth by sad experience. Thus, if we turn our eyes to those countries where tyranny reigns, we shall see the power of the people lost, and the skill in arms confined to a few mercenaries, as tools to their princes; and by this method lordly power disposes all things according to the will of the prince; which may kind heaven forbid ever being our lamentable case!</P>
<P N="3">3. This necessity, for a christian people being trained in the use of arms, is also pointed out by the certainty that earth and hell are com∣bined to persecute the people of God. See the Apostle's declaring this matter, <Q>But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit, even so it is now.</Q> Gal. iv. 29. <Q>And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he per∣secuted the woman which brought forth the man-child.</Q> Rev. xii. 13. This rage and combination of earth and hell against God's true people renders the art of war necessary for true Christians, as a means to preserve them∣selves from the persecuting fury of evil men, moved with the rage of the old dragon. It is a most apparent truth, that in all cases, the
<PB N="11" REF="013276_0012_0F9049ED89B57940"/>
means of preservation ought in wisdom and prudence to be proportioned to the real danger a people are in. Hence, the more and stronger are their enemies, the greater is the necessity for a christian people to be skilled in the art of defence.</P>
<P N="4">4. The absolute necessity for a christian peo∣ple to learn the art of war opens to our sight, if we only recollect, that without it, a people are in such a defenceless state, that their wealth does but expose them, by encouraging and tempting their ambitious or covetous neighbours to make them a prey; which has often been the case. And to prevent this, and other evils, no doubt Abram trained his servants to the use of arms. And besides, the experience of all na∣tions in times of war, fully discovers, that neither numbers nor courage, without order and art, are sufficient to protect a nation or people.</P>
<P>This has been remarkably verified in the empire of Russia; where they neither wanted courage nor numbers, but art in war; there∣fore were easily vanquished by a handful of well-disciplined Swedes, until they acquired art in war, by which they recovered themselves, and are now esteemed and revered by their neighbours, and perhaps as good soldiers as any in the world, having of late done such things in arms, against the Turks, as will make them
<PB N="12" REF="013276_0013_0F9049EDCCB48870"/>
famous <HI>in ages to come.</HI> In this light, the necessity of learning the art of war, for our own defence, strongly urges itself upon us.</P>
<P N="5">5. The sixth command of the decalogue, "Thou shalt not kill," lays this necessity pow∣erfully upon the people of God. For, if they may not be guilty of shedding their own blood, or the blood of others, they must use all proper means to preserve their own lives, and the lives of others, or else be accessory to their own destruction: Now then let Christians see and feel the necessity of acquiring the art of war, in obedience to God's command, and out of regard to their natural, civil and religious rights, and for self-preservation, and for the preserva∣tion of their dearest▪ friends and most important enjoyments, on earth or in heaven; that in doing this they may have consciences void of offence toward God and man.</P>
<P N="6">6. The enemies of God's church in the world, that surround his people, acquiring the use of arms, render it necessary for the people of God to be trained in like skill. Thus we hear holy king David lamenting over Saul and his sons, who fell by the archers on the moun∣tains of Gilboa, and, <Q>He bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow.</Q> Now then, in imitation of king David, we may say, let the children of New-England learn the use of the firelock, lest their brave commanders fall by the art of her enemies, on her pleasant
<PB N="13" REF="013276_0014_0F9049EE9352DE70"/>
mountains, in some future day; when, like David, too late to save our brave leaders, we bade teach the use of fire-arms, and art of war.</P>
<P>Finally, it appears as necessary for a christian people to know and use the art of war, for their security, as it is to know and use the art of husbandry for their support in life: And it is as reasonable to expect, in ordinary cases, our provision without labour, as our protection without the art of war, or skill in arms. Be∣cause God is able to defend his people, without art in war, shall we be careless, and take no pains to learn the skill of defence? We might as well argue, because God is able to provide for his people without work, and sometimes has doneit, asin the wilderness; therefore we may be idle and commit ourselves to Providence: Such reasoning is unworthy of men, or Christians. In this short view of the necessity for a religious people to learn and improve the arts of war, for their protection; and the importance of this art increasing as a people increase in wealth and riches, in fine fields, and fair buildings, is un∣deniable. Otherwise, the increase or growth of a people will be but the stronger temptation, and richer prey, for some aspiring or covetous Nimrod, skilled in the art of war. And it is likely to be our case in this land, at no great distance of time, if we do not, like Abram, train our households for war, in a time of profound peace and quiet.
<PB N="14" REF="013276_0015_0F9049EF4779D180"/>
Now we may close this discourse by a few observations.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is to be observed, although it be most evidently lawful for a christian people to learn and use the art of war, yet it is only so with regard to lawful war, which is for the defence and recovery of human rights, or as an act of bene∣volence to human creatures, and in obedience to the immediate command of God, in executing his just vengeance on the wicked. The art of war, as now used, to rob and enslave nations, and deprive them of their liberty and property, in order to aggrandize others, is a most vile and sinful abuse of human skill or art, and ought to be considered, at this day, in that light, as a sore judgment and scourge on the world.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let it be observed, that the art of war is not the less lawful or necessary for the people of God, because others abuse it to deprive their fellow-creatures of their natural rights; but the more lawful and necessary for them, that they may be the more able to resist such abuse of human art, maintain or recover their own rights; for othewise they would be, without a constant miracle, instantly devoured by those enemies of human freedom, that dwell around them. And I hope we have none, or at least but a very few, who would expect such a mi∣raculous protection at this day. Under this observation we are naturally drawn to survey a
<PB N="15" REF="013276_0016_0F9049EFEEE40740"/>
little the sweets of life, the almost divine plea∣sure of freedom, the tender and dear relations of nature, the tents of Shem in which we dwell, the fruitful fields that surround us, and quiet dwellings in which we now rest, the honest earnings of our hands with the sweat of our brows, or the patrimony of our dear ancestors. And then turn our thoughts on the gloomy prospect of a bloody carnage of our dear coun∣trymen and friends, in the high places of the field, our wives and children torn from our bosoms, our lives in jeopardy every moment, our liberty turned to slavery, our religious assem∣blies the glory of our land no more, our houses and fields turned to strangers! And all this loss and misery come upon us for our neglect to improve in the use of arms and art of war! With these thoughts, who would forbear to imitate Abram in training his servants, or en∣couraging the art of war, as necessary for a christian people; and peculiarly so for this now flourishing country, that it's growing wealth, in a defenceless state, tempt not it's enemies to lay it waste?</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence it is beyond dispute, that an at∣tempt to increase the knowledge of arms among us, at this time, is highly commendable in itself, and may be of vast and noble consequence, if attended with prudence and care, so that no occasion may be given, justly to complain, that vice is encouraged and increased thereby.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="16" REF="013276_0017_0F9049F0CBCCE790"/>
4. The business of this day being of this nature, and a free-will offering, is to be justly and highly commended, if soberly and wisely conducted; especially, seeing we are in danger, otherwise, to lose the use of arms, it being about eight years since the military company in this place has been regularly called upon to attend such exercises, by the proper officers; which, no doubt, is the case through this whole regiment. If this should continue and spread in other regiments all over the province, and no private care be taken, it would soon render our state defenceless, in a great measure: But to prevent this, may the laudable temper of martial exercise diffuse itself through all ranks in the province; and we become a regularly disciplined, or trained soldiery, that none may be tempted to enslave or spoil us, for a prey to themselves.</P>
<P N="5">5. The harmony and readiness of submission to those who act the part of officers on this occasion, will put an honor on your persons, recommend your business, and be one part of the beauty, as well as profit, in this attempt, to increase your acquaintance with the necessary art of war, and without such harmony your design will be frustrated in a great measure, and yourselves disgraced.</P>
<P N="6">6. The conduct in closing the day, on such occasions, will be considered, as your honor
<PB N="17" REF="013276_0018_0F9049F16D3929E8"/>
or dishonor; your honor, in seasonably and soberly returning to your respective families, as men who would prove that you had no sordid and base purposes to serve, by your meeting together; thus your design will appear honest, sincere and praise-worthy: But if, instead of this, you spend the evening following such exercises at taverns, in drinking and the like debasing and immoral practices, it will dishonor your business, and give occasion to speak evil of you and your exercises, as a source of cor∣ruption, and unworthy to be encouraged by sober men.</P>
<P>Finally, my young brethren, I wish you may be good soldiers in the use of arms, for your king and country; but above all, that you may be reminded, by this day's exercise, of being good soldiers under King Jesus; fighting against all spiritual enemies, with spiritual arms, for an eternal crown.</P>
