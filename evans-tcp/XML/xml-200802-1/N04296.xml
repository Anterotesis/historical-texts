<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IT is generally confessed, even by the most eminent</HI> European <HI>writers on commerce, that their money is a subject of a</HI> curious <HI>and</HI> very intricate <HI>nature; which, without any such acknowledgment, the</HI> various <HI>and</HI> clashing <HI>opinions they have ad∣vanced concerning it is a</HI> sufficient <HI>proof of.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The principles of paper-money may seem much harder to discover, were we to form a judgment of the difficulty from the</HI> numerous absurdities <HI>published for and against it. If their bulk be not encreased by this little piece, the author will not think his time</HI> mispent; <HI>tho' the matter contained in it has <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more</HI> months <HI>to</HI> study <HI>than it will the reader</HI> minutes <HI>to</HI> peruse <HI>and, peradventure, to comprehend.</HI></P>
<P><HI>There is not in the whole discourse any one assertion,</HI> thought necessary to be prov∣ed, <HI>that is not supported, or</HI> endeavoured <HI>to be supported by a</HI> plain <HI>argument. This is of∣fered in extenuation of the faults in the method and style; which, if not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> gross as to ob∣scure the sense, a good humour'd reader may be inclined to over-lock, after he is inform∣ed that, thro' want of time (how it happened is not material) the following thoughts were</HI> hastily <HI>extracted from a great variety of reflections, thrown together on paper</HI> occasionally, <HI>and at</HI> different times, <HI>as they occurred to the mind of the writer in the course of his inqui∣ry into the nature of this</HI> abstruse <HI>subject.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A DISCOURSE CONCERNING PAPER MONEY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE rarity of silver and its beautiful colour were sufficient before it became a medium of Trade, to procure it a price, even supposing it destitute of <HI>natural</HI> value; tho' such a kind of worth is merely <HI>fan∣tastical,</HI> like that of diamonds, which is also derived from <HI>fancy.</HI></P>
<P>Silver is still a commodity, as every thing bought and sold is; but then it is also money, which gives it a rank above other wares exchanged by it.</P>
<P>That commodity for which the rest in the country are <HI>generally</HI> bought and sold, is the currency or money of the country.</P>
<P>The nummary denominations, and by which accounts are kept, throughout <HI>Europe,</HI> do all stand for certain quantities of silver, and none of 'em for gold: Therefore as all contracts, in that part of the world are made for the first, and not any for the second, tho' they may be discharged by it, ac∣cording to its <HI>varying</HI> rate; the former is the currency of <HI>Europe,</HI> and the latter is nothing more than a commodity.</P>
<P>In <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Maryland,</HI> tobacco being that for which all other commodities are <HI>generally</HI> exchanged, is the currency of these Provinces, as rice is, for a like reason, in <HI>South-Carolina;</HI> yet they are not so by the sanction of law: It is there∣fore <HI>probable</HI> that silver, being much better qualified than either of 'em for a medi∣um of commerce, rose up to that dignity by its own proper force; for the im∣pression that the several pieces, into which it is divided, receive at the mint, is of no other use than to ascertain their respective quantites and fineness, in order to save the trouble of weighing and trying 'em on every occasion.</P>
<P>But bits of paper, however denominated, could never become a currency without the <HI>compulsive</HI> aid of the legislature; for, if all had been left <HI>at liberty</HI> to refuse them, their nummary denominations could never have persuaded any bo∣dy to give any thing for 'em.</P>
<P>In the year 1722 the government of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> began to coin paper-money. The sum of 15,000 l. was then struck in bills of <HI>one</HI> shilling to <HI>twenty,</HI> which was lent out on land-security at five <HI>per cent.</HI> Those bill the legislature decla¦red
<PB N="4" REF="005308_0004_1016FA9E7029C5E0"/>
equal to as much silver-money of <HI>America</HI> as their respective denominations signified. Had the law stopt here their value could not have rose above waste paper. But as they were also made according to their declared rates, a legal tender in discharge of the silver-contracts then subsisting, they naturally became money:</P>
<P>For debtors were <HI>willingly</HI> led to sell their goods for 'em at the nominal value assigned by the legislature, <HI>knowing</HI> they could pass 'em on the same foot∣ing to their creditors; whose interest it also became to support the credit of the new coin, while they had any debts remaining unpaid in the old. Other tra∣ders, as may well be supposed, were at first fearful to contract for this new spe∣cies of money; but finding it kept up its value, or (when they <HI>fancied</HI> it did not) that the advanced price on their goods ballanced the <HI>imaginary</HI> loss, they were as eager to bargain for it as they were before for silver.</P>
<P>Were it not for the confusion which an alteration in the nummary denominati∣ons, that people have have been accustomed to count by, would produce in trade, those paper bills might as well have been called and distinguished by <HI>livres, sols</HI> and <HI>deniers,</HI> or by any other terms of value, as by <HI>pounds, shillings</HI> and <HI>pence.</HI> The power with which they were respectively indued were also arbitrary; for the law could as easily have made one of them mark∣ed <HI>five shillings</HI> pass for <HI>five pounds,</HI> silver money of <HI>America,</HI> as it did for <HI>five shil∣lings</HI> of that coin. But the retaining of names, and the annexing to them differ∣ent ideas from what they usually convey, amounts to an actual alteration of the names: It was therefore as necessary that the bills should, <HI>at their first emission,</HI> be endued with such powers as <HI>generally</HI> accompanied their respective denomina∣tions, as to give them the denominations by which the people <HI>generally</HI> counted.</P>
<P>To fix the idea of paper-money it may be proper to show wherein it differs from paper-credit. When credit is given for money, there is always a promise expressed or implied for the payment of it; if expressed, it is <HI>generally</HI> on paper; and from these circumstances the latter kind of engagements where they are transferable by law or custom, is called a paper-credit. But the paper-bills of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> as they do not promise money for <HI>any thing else,</HI> cannot be compre∣hended under the notion of paper-credit. They are <HI>actually</HI> money, and may as properly be termed paper-money from the material of which they are made, as silver-coin is so denominated from the metal. All assignable notes promising paper-coin are paper-credit on the same reason that notes promising silver-coin are so.</P>
<P>Forasmuch as the law, by which the <HI>Maryland-</HI> bills were issued, <HI>insures</HI> to the possessors, at <HI>certain</HI> periods, the quantity of silver expressed by them, they could only be regarded as paper-credit <HI>at their first emission:</HI> But as they pass at a much higher rate than the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of discount allow, they are at present to be consider∣ed as a mixture of paper-money and paper-credit. This last supplies the place of cash, and according to the extent of it, is of more or less advantage to a coun∣try where silver is the <HI>established</HI> medium of commerce; that being a currency which
<PB N="5" REF="005308_0005_1016FA9FF7AA2328"/>
costs <HI>extremely dear.</HI> But where paper-money is used, if there be a sufficiency, the cost of which is comparatively nothing, a paper-credit can be of little, if any service at all.</P>
<P>We return to the law whereby paper-bills were first introduced into <HI>Pennsyl∣vania,</HI> and observe that it gradually lost its efficacy, as the silver-contracts sub∣sisting at the time of passing it were paid off. The power of the bills would have sunk in the same degree, were not the people obliged, thro' the want of sil∣ver, to use them as their medium of commerce. Now forasmuch as they contract for 'em every day as they did before for silver, their worth is on as good a foun∣dation as it was at their first emission; for the present debtors are under as strong a necessity of purchasing 'em to disengage their promises for that coin, as the former debtors were to discharge their contracts for silver-coin; and therefore their worth cannot fall while trade continues to furnish 'em with an employment equal to what it now does, as it always will unless their quantity be <HI>rashly</HI> encreas∣ed, or a better currency be introduced in their room, which seems morally im∣possible: For even with respect to an independent government, which, by pru∣dently prohibiting some and laying high duties on other kinds of foreign com∣modities, may <HI>generally</HI> have such a quantity of silver as the trade of the country requires, for it may sometimes have <HI>too much</HI> as well as too little; silver is never∣theless a currency, not to insist on the great cost of it, much inferior to paper-money on several other <HI>important</HI> accounts; as will be demonstrated in the sequel. <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> must, except in a few trifling instances, pay silver for all the goods imported from <HI>England,</HI> and cannot impose the least duty on any of them. To attempt then to introduce that metal into the Province, as a medium of commerce, which in a dependent government, as <HI>Pennsylvania is,</HI> will ever be a currency <HI>extremely precarious;</HI> and NEGLECT to improve and extend the pow∣er of the paper-money, whose advantages have been experienced during a peri∣od of more than twenty years; would be a proceeding which I should confess my self at an utter loss to account for.</P>
<Q>Quidquid id est timeo Danaos &amp; dona fere<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tes. <BIBL>Virg.</BIBL></Q>
<P>The principles on which the value of the currency of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> is supported, <HI>undeniably</HI> evince, that, were the duty for purchasing the silver promised to the possessors of the <HI>Maryland-bills,</HI> to be discontinued, their present value could not be lessened: For the people of that Province would be then under the same obligation of purchasing 'em to discharge their contracts as they are at pre∣sent; and would as willingly bargain for 'em afterwards as the people of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> do now for the bills current amongst them.</P>
<P>I would add farther, that if the silver-contracts at present subsisting among the former, were to be made payable in paper-bills, according to their varying worth in silver, which the course of exchange discovers, the employment and consequently the value of 'em would be increased (but I do not insinuate it ought to be above what it is) much more than it would by making them a legal tender at a certain fix'd rate in discharge of silver-contracts; for that is an ex∣pedient
<PB N="6" REF="005308_0006_1016FA8CAF7CFF68"/>
which, after the bills have obtained a currency, cannot be introduced nor continued without danger; forasmuch as it has a <HI>direct</HI> tendency to force merchants into the truck-trade; which, in their own defence, they must all run into, when they see the currency pour'd upon 'em without bounds. In such a case none will fell their goods for it on credit, unless at a prodigious advance; and on the other side it will have but little employment in discharging silver-contracts, for no new ones of that kind will be made; so that under these circumstances the wonder is not why it should in some colonies have sunk so much in value, but rather how it could preserve any value at all.</P>
<P>The proprietary quit-rents in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> reserved since the use of paper-mo∣ney, are made payable by the patents in silver, or the value in paper-coin, ac∣cording to the course of exchange. Those reserved before paper-money was in∣troduced, which are said to be small compared with the others, the law regu∣lates the payment of during a certain term of Years, at the rate of eighteen pence for one shilling <HI>sterling.</HI> But to this the <HI>Honourable Proprietaries</HI> themselves assented in consideration of the sum of 1200l as appears by the publick proceed∣ings.</P>
<P>The value of the paper-money of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> notwithstanding the obvious manner of accounting for it, is attributed by many to the land-security on which it is lent; and, in support of this notion, the following argument, who∣ever first broached it, has been printed; which I shall <HI>particularly</HI> examine <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> as it has been <HI>generally</HI> adopted, it cannot <HI>with defency</HI> be condemned in the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> It runs thus. <HI>As those who take bills out of the banks in</HI> Europe <HI>put in money for secu∣rity, so here we engage our land. And as bills issued upon money-security are money, so bills issued upon land-security are, in effect, coined <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> Now the Banks of <HI>Europe</HI> do ac∣tually <HI>borrow</HI> the money lodged with them, and therefore <HI>give</HI> their notes as a se∣curity for the repayment▪ But the paper-money-bank of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> to which the argument is applied, does not borrow but <HI>lend</HI> money, and therefore <HI>takes</HI> security from the borrowers for the repayment at the times stipulated. The two cases then, instead of having the <HI>least</HI> resemblance, being <HI>essentially</HI> opposite; it is impossible that any conclusion drawn from the one should be applicable to the other. Indeed the bills given by an <HI>European</HI> bank have the same power as the silver promised by 'em; because the possessors have a <HI>right</HI> to receive, and do also receive on demand the very firms expressed by such bills. But those of <HI>Penn∣sylvania</HI> cannot, for a like reason, nor for any reason, be considered as land; for tho' they be lent upon land, yet the possessors have no <HI>right</HI> to demand from any man, or any body of men, any land for 'em.</P>
<P>Having shown that the value of the paper-money depends on the <HI>general</HI> em∣ployment given it by trade; we from thence descend to prove that the employ∣ment, and consequently the value of it, will, on a supposition of its quantity continuing the same, be more or less in proportion to the INTRINSIC WORTH of the <HI>moveable commodities</HI> exchanged by it.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="005308_0007_1016FAA631605D98"/>
When these encrease in quantity without diminishing in goodness or quality, or encrease in quality without diminishing in quantity; their <HI>intrinsic worth is encreased.</HI></P>
<P>The more any particular sort of goods is wanted, the more hands will be em∣ployed in raising, making and transporting 'em to market for sale and <HI>vice versa:</HI> From whence it follows, <HI>That the</HI> Intrinsic worth <HI>of</HI> moveable <HI>commodities will be</HI> always <HI>proportioned to the labour and skill expended on the several species,</HI> considered toge∣ther, <HI>of which it is composed.</HI></P>
<P>The value of the land belonging to a society may fall tho' the people encrease, if their diligence decreases in a greater proportion, <HI>as may sometimes</HI> happen. But the value of the land will <HI>infallibly</HI> rise with the <HI>intrinsic worth</HI> of the moveable commodities; which may be occasioned by an increase of industry in the people as well as by an increase in their number. Therefore it is plainly the interest of land-holders and the owners of houses who propose a rent by them, to desire, a∣bove all others, a plenty of money; for, without it, a great part of society, who, with it, might be engaged to set their hands to useful work, will remain un∣employed; while others whose livelihood depends on their manual labour, and who, on an offer of ready money would <HI>eagerly, constantly</HI> strive to earn it, will not work but as mere necessity compels them. Hence it clearly appears that land-holders are the <HI>natural</HI> guardians of the publick interest; since without advan∣cing their own they cannot promote the other, nor suffer it to be lessened with∣out suffering themselves in an equal degree: Whereas merchants (or Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> is mistaken) as well as usurers or money-jobbers, land-jobbers and super-nume∣rary officers, with their tribe of retainers and dependents, may all <HI>very possibly</HI> grow rich, while the rest of the community are oppressed and kept poor. Yet because it is the immediate interest of land-holders <HI>in general,</HI> to promote the public good, that therefore it must always be the immediate interest of every one in <HI>particular;</HI> or, supposing it to be the case, that <HI>therefore</HI> none of 'em will sacrifice <HI>a real</HI> advantage to a lust of power, when an opportunity of gratifying it pre∣sents; or to a desire of <HI>lording</HI> it over their brethren, tho' the prospect may seem remote; is a fallacious way of arguing; tho' it is a doctrine that has <HI>formerly</HI> been currently swallowed, <HI>to the great detriment of the patients,</HI> in a certain colony which I forbear to name.</P>
<P>And now craving pardon for this digression, I re-assume the principal argument and pursue it thus;</P>
<P>Paper-money is only wanted to exchange commodities, which it does, whe∣ther they be sold absolutely for it or only for a time, or whether the payment be immediate or time be given for the payment. Commodities are never exchang∣ed unless they be wanted: Therefore the demand for paper-money must rise and fall with the demand for the commodities (among which we must here in∣clude the land) exchanged by it.</P>
<P>If the <HI>intrinsic worth of moveable</HI> commodities be not encreased, neither rents nor the value of land can rise, nor, consequently, the demand for money, to dis∣charge the one or purchase the other:</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="005308_0008_1016FA8B2A14F300"/>
Neither, on the same supposition, can the continual variations in the value of <HI>moveable</HI> commodities, with respect to one another, encrease the demand for money; for it is <HI>impossible</HI> that any of the sorts should rise unless the others fall. As then the demand and consequently the value of the paper-money cannot be encreased, so it cannot be lessened, but in proportion to the <HI>intrinsic worth</HI> of the <HI>moveable</HI> commodities exchanged by it. If the reader has not forgot, that when this inference was offered to be proved, it was on a supposi∣tion that the quantity of money in trade remain'd the same, he'll more clearly perceive the truth of the position now laying down, to wit, That, could a me∣thod be fallen upon to augment and diminish the quantity of the currency ac∣cording to the demand for it; <HI>its value would remain▪</HI> UNALTERABLE; for as the proportion between the money extant and the intrinsic worth of the <HI>moveable</HI> commodities exchanged by it, would be always alike; the same number of shillings or pounds would at all times purchase the same quantity of <HI>labour and art,</HI> or of the <HI>necessaries and conveniences of life,</HI> taking one article with another; as for instance, should domestic commodities rise in price, with respect to pa∣per money, they would do so with respect to foreign goods, which must there∣fore fall proportionably; so that when more money than usual is required for the one, less will serve for the other. Thus, in every case that can be put, the value of the money (supposing a constant proportion preserved between the quantity extant and the intrinsic worth of the commodities exchanged by it) will, as it stands in comparison not with one or a few, but with all the commodities purchaseable by it, be found <HI>unalterable;</HI> which is the <HI>highest pitch of perfection</HI> that money can arrive at; for beyond this point it is impossible to carry it, with∣out rendering invariable the natural and constantly variable relations of commo∣dities to one another.</P>
<P>Now in order to preserve a <HI>constant</HI> proportion between the quantity of money floating in trade, and the demand for it, there needs nothing more than to open a bank that shall lend on good real security for the <HI>natural</HI> interest, whatever sums may be applied for; and shall also receive back any sum, if not too tri∣fling, from any person offering it, tho' not a borrower, allowing him the natu∣ral interest or an equivalent to it, 'till he calls it out again.</P>
<P>An increase of trade will encrease the number of borrowers, and consequent∣ly the hire of money: Therefore the bank continuing to lend it out at the same interest it let for before that increase, will at once be enabled to augment the quantity accordingly. On the other hand a decrease in trade will decrease the number of borrowers, and consequently the hire of money: Therefore the bank, continuing to give the same interest it let for before, must <HI>inevitably</HI> draw in the part, which on every decrease of commerce, will be left without em∣ployment; and thus the quantity▪ of money floating in trade will be augmented and diminished, <HI>exactly</HI> with the demand for it.</P>
<P>Admitting, <HI>for argument's sake,</HI> the natural rate of interest to be five <HI>per cent</HI>▪ a premium of four and a half will <HI>probably</HI> prove sufficient to draw in the su∣perfluous
<PB N="9" REF="005308_0009_1016FABD63DDDAB0"/>
cash at any time extant; for such an interest when with if the princi∣pal may be had on demand, is at least as good as five <HI>per cent.</HI> on any private security, where besides the risque, the lender can never be sure of having his money again, as he would be at the bank, whenever an opportunity offers of laying it out to greater advantage. Therefore should the full natural interest be∣tween man and man be allowed by the bank for the money returned upon it; the quantity extant, instead of ever exceeding, will rather fall short of the proportion required by trade; which must incline it to sink instead of rising in value. But this inconvenience may be easily avoided by lessening the premium; which, without leaving it to the discretion of the managers of the bank, may be regulated by a <HI>perpetual</HI> table, that the men of figures will easily form on the <HI>Data,</HI> furnished 'em by one year's experience. On the same <HI>Data,</HI> rules may be laid down for discovering at all times the hire of money at market; for, as that lessens, the interest <HI>paid</HI> and <HI>received</HI> at the bank must be lessened too. There can be no occasion to encrease it at any time for the natural interest between man and man (which, by the way, can never fall too low) will be always falling until every branch of trade be fully supplied with money. These last hints may seem superfluous to such as have duely re∣flected on the nature of interest, as they really would be, were they added, <HI>on∣ly</HI> on their account, to strengthen this conclusion, <HI>That the Scheme it as</HI> easy <HI>in practice, as it is</HI> true <HI>in theory.</HI></P>
<P>The end of money is to facilitate the exchange of commodities, and therefore it is significantly called <HI>an instrument of commerce.</HI> It is the tool which mer∣chants work with, and its deficiency in power does <HI>more immediately</HI> affect them than any other calling, because their business consists in exchanging and distri∣buting goods; for which reason Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> throws them together, from the highest to the lowest class, under the general <HI>emphatical</HI> name of <HI>Brokers.</HI> Yet, however necessary money may be to traders, they either will not (and with good reason) contract for a paper-currency when they <HI>apprehend</HI> it likely to fall▪ or they'll raise the price of their goods according to the strength of that apprehensi∣on; and in both cases the employment and value of the money will be lessened. While these jealousies exist its power cannot be extended; and unless they be removed, it will on every addition made to it, decrease faster in value than it can be encreased in quantity. But were this scheme to be carried into execution, as no doubt it will, if the arguments before offered be found conclusive; sellers, on the one hand, would be convinced <HI>the money could not fall in value,</HI> and buyers, on the other, that <HI>it could not prove deficient in quantity;</HI> which circumstances <HI>concurring</HI> would <HI>immediately</HI> cause it to circulate thro' every vein of commerce, and <HI>at once</HI> blow up the truck-trade; a manner of traffick, which, whether it be from the difficulties it is accompanied with, or the opportunities it furnishes <HI>artful,</HI> disho∣nest traders in exchanging and distributing commodities to <HI>cheat</HI> the raisers, makers and consumers of 'em, or on both accounts; has always been reckoned by every <HI>polite</HI> nation, where trade flourished, a mark of BARBARISM.</P>
<P>Exchange fell lately in <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> from 145 l. to 125 l. and in a few months after rose to 165 l. which was owing to the sudden encrease and decrease of the
<PB N="10" REF="005308_0010_1016FAA816A27EA0"/>
trinsic worth of the commodities that gave employment to the currency. But if its quantity had been augmented and diminished accordingly, the price of sterling bills of exchange could not have risen or fallen but just half as much as it did. And had the sum and power of the whole currency extant been the treble of what it was, when exchange was at 145 l. it could not have risen high∣er than 147 &amp; <HI>a half</HI> nor fallen lower than 142 &amp; <HI>a half.</HI> I omit the demon∣stration here, for as much as the principles on which it is founded were descri∣bed very particularly in one of the publick prints some months ago; and the consequences flowing from thence were proved so clearly, that several gentle∣men, who think themselves knowing in the theory of money, because they can give themselves leave to practice any <HI>unjustifiable</HI> arts of getting it, were pleased to declare the writer gave himself an unnecessary trouble, since, as they affirmed the points he then undertook to demonstrate, were before his writing, as perspi∣cuous to them as the <HI>meridian</HI> sun.</P>
<P>An exact judgment cannot be formed of the sum of money necessary for car∣rying on the trade of any society, tho' we knew the number of the individuals▪ for people are not in all places equally industrious; neither can we arrive at any certainty in this matter, tho' we were acquainted with the annual quantity of their several kinds of labour; for when the members of a community are settled close together, each will apply himself to one single trade, which will cause a greater exchange of commodities than if they were scattered on a large surface <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for then each would be obliged to follow several occupations at once, and so <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> much less quantity of commodities would be exchanged. The running cash <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>England</HI> is computed at <HI>twenty millions,</HI> to which if we add the bank-notes and other paper-pledges that pass as ready money, which are therefore in this case to be considered as part of the nation's cash, the whole cannot amount to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> than <HI>forty millions.</HI> This sum divided among <HI>ten millions</HI> of souls for so many <HI>England</HI> is reckoned to contain, gives 4 l. for each. Now allowing there are in <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> 150,000 souls, their currency, if it was to be proportioned by that of <HI>England▪</HI> should be equal in power to 600,000 l. sterling. But abating the one half, for the reasons just now offered, it follows that the 80,000 l. now ex∣tant in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> as it has not a greater power than 50,000 l. sterling, is but the sixth part of what the trade of the province requires. But tho' this at the best is but <HI>probable</HI> if it be even that, yet it is <HI>certain</HI> that the currency of the co∣lony is <HI>vastly short</HI> of what its domestic trade will bear, since it is too evident the greatest branches of it depend on barter only. Moreover as people cannot with∣out great difficulty exchange their labour, if money which is the medium of ex∣change be wanting, families are thereby drove to live independently of one a∣nother, and to provide as much as possible within themselves whatever is ne∣cessary for their support. The pleasures of society having by this means lost the chief place in their thoughts, they seek out land at the cheapest rate. To this it is in a great measure owing that his Majesty's subjects in <HI>America,</HI> including many who are born as well as others who annually arrive there, are daily re∣tiring back in great numbers from the Sea, which renders 'em as useless to the colony as to their <HI>Mother-country,</HI> for such consume little or none of her manu∣factures
<PB N="11" REF="005308_0011_1016FAA185AD6650"/>
On the other side, forasmuch as people living close together and ready at hand to assist one another can, if money be not wanting, more easily ob∣tain the necessaries and comforts of life than a like number more thinly settled; it is plain that a plentiful currency would render the subjects much more useful to <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and to one another than they now are, as they would thereby be spontaneously drawn into a narrower compass, to which in such a case, they would be farther allured by the rational pleasures that accompany a social life. On these considerations one can hardly forbear thinking, that the paper-money of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> might in a few years attain a power equal to 300,000 l. sterling. And then supposing the exports and imports to be double of what they now are, and that the employment which they at present furnish the paper-money in exchanging them should be even trebled; yet its variation in value compa∣red with silver (which, as was mentioned once before, may for the most part be exactly discovered by the price of sterling bills of exchange) would be trif∣ling. In the mean while its worth in that metal would, on this scheme, <HI>taking one time with another,</HI> be invariable, or at least not perceptible 'till after many years; for tho' a vast quantity of silver and gold is daily dug out of the earth, and found on the surface of it, yet it is exceedingly small with respect to the sum of both in the trade of the world; and therefore their <HI>declining</HI> worth cannot be easily perceived on a short retrospect.</P>
<P>In the next number it will be shown, that the money cannot, consistent with <HI>justice</HI> and <HI>public honour,</HI> be lent out at less than the <HI>natural</HI> interest; nor that less than that interest, or an equivalent to it, can be refused to such as shall be dispo∣sed to return any part of it on the bank. In discussing these points, not only the reasonableness of the scheme, but the nature and <HI>inestimable</HI> advantages of a pa∣per-currency will be further illustrated.</P>
<P>Let liberty and property be secured ever so well, yet the labour and industry of the people, from which the riches of every community are wholly derived, can∣not be drawn forth to the length they are capable of, without a plenty of money. This considered, it may not be thought an extravagant assertion, that a paper-currency must <HI>necessarily,</HI> in proportion to the number of the individuals, prove to every society using it in the manner set forth, <HI>a more valuable</HI> and a <HI>much more certain</HI> source of wealth, than the gold of <HI>Brazil</HI> is to <HI>Portugal,</HI> or than the inex∣haustible silver-mines of <HI>Potosi</HI> are to <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
