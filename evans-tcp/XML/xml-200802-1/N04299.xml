<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following SERMONS, I think I may say were given me by the Lord Jesus Christ; and according to my present Light are agreeable to the Form of sound Words delivered to as in the lively Oracles of God. They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Sum and Substance, I will not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Word for Word of what was delivered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from the Pulpit▪ for, as I had Occasion in <HI>America, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon the same Subject<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

the People's Circumstances amongst whom I was preaching the Kingdom of God. I had no Leisure or Freedom to commit any of them to Writing, but during my last Voyage from <HI>America</HI> to <HI>England;</HI> nor do I expect to find Leisure to write down any more fresh Discourses, till it shall please God that I embark again. May the Spirit of God, who delights out of the Mouths of Babes and Sucklings to perfect Praise, bless them to every Reader, and put into their Hearts to pray for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> poor, unworthy Servant in Jesus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>

we <HI>disclaim</HI> the Doctrine of <HI>Merit,</HI> are ashamed <HI>directly</HI> to say we <HI>deserve</HI> any <HI>Good</HI> at the Hands of God; therefore, as the <HI>Apostle</HI> excellently well observes, <HI>we go about,</HI> we fetch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Circuit,</HI> to establish a Righteousness of our <HI>own,</HI> and, like the <HI>Pharisees</HI> of old, will not <HI>wholly</HI> sub∣mit to <HI>that Righteousness,</HI> which is of <HI>God</HI> thro' <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> our Lord.</P>

<P>The <HI>Righteousness</HI> of Jesus Christ is one of those <HI>great</HI> Mysteries the <HI>Angels</HI> desire to <HI>look <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> and seems to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lessons</HI> that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> taught Men <HI>after</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Fall.

were made of <HI>Skins</HI> of <HI>Beasts,</HI> and as Beasts were not then <HI>Food</HI> for Men, we may <HI>fairly infer,</HI> that those <HI>Beasts</HI> were slain in <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> in <HI>Commemoration</HI> of the <HI>great Sacrifice</HI> Jesus Christ <HI>hereafter</HI> to be offered.

If <HI>so,</HI> if there were <HI>no other</HI> Text in the Bible to prove the <HI>Divinity</HI> of Christ, <HI>that</HI> is sufficient. For if the Word <HI>Lord</HI> may <HI>properly</HI> belong to Jesus Christ, He <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> be God. For as you have it in the <HI>Margins</HI> of your Bibles, the Word <HI>Lord</HI> is in the Original <HI>Jehovah,</HI> which is the <HI>Essential</HI> Title of God himself.

<P>How the <HI>Lord</HI> is to be <HI>Man's Righteousness</HI> comes next to be consider'd.</P>
<P>And that is, in one Word, by <HI>Imputation.</HI>—For it pleased God, after he had made all Thing; <HI>by the Word of his Power,</HI> to create <HI>Man</HI> after his <HI>own</HI> Image.

<P>We may state it thus:—<Q>The Evangelist St. <HI>Mark,</HI> say they, <HI>Chap.</HI> x. mentions a <HI>young Man</HI> that came to Christ, <HI>running</HI> and <HI>asking</HI> him, what he should <HI>do</HI> to inherit <HI>eter∣nal Life?</HI> Christ, say they, <HI>referred</HI> him to the <HI>Commandments,</HI> to <HI>know what</HI> he must <HI>do</HI> to inherit <HI>eternal</HI> Life.

<P>But perhaps they will <HI>reply,</HI> it is said, <Q>Jesus <HI>beholding</HI> him <HI>loved</HI> him.</Q> And <HI>what</HI> then?

<P>But there is a <HI>fourth</HI> and <HI>grand Objection</HI> yet behind, and that is taken from the 25th <HI>Chapter of St.</HI> Matthew, <Q>where our Lord is <HI>described,</HI> as <HI>rewarding</HI> People with <HI>eternal Life, because</HI> they fed the <HI>hungry,</HI> clothed the <HI>naked,</HI> and such like.—Their <HI>Works</HI> therefore were a <HI>Cause</HI> of their <HI>Justification;</HI> consequently, the Doctrine of <HI>imputed Righteousness</HI> is not agreeable to Scripture.</Q></P>

And in order that we may <HI>an∣swer</HI> it in as <HI>clear</HI> and <HI>brief</HI> a Manner as may be, we <HI>confess,</HI> with the Article of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> <Q>that albeit <HI>good Works</HI> do not <HI>justify us,</HI> yet they will <HI>follow after Justifica∣tion,</HI> as <HI>Fruits</HI> of it; and tho' they can <HI>claim</HI> no Reward in <HI>themselves,</HI> yet forasmuch as they <HI>spring</HI> from <HI>Faith in</HI> Christ, and <HI>a re∣newed Soul,</HI> they shall <HI>receive</HI> a Reward <HI>of Grace,</HI> tho' no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>of Debt;</HI> and consequent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <HI>mere</HI> we abound in <HI>such good Works,</HI> the <HI>greater</HI> will be our <HI>Reward</HI> when <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> shall come <HI>to Judgment.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Take <HI>these</HI> Considerations along with us, and they will help us much to <HI>answer</HI> the Objection

now before us.—For <HI>thus</HI> St. <HI>Matthew.—</HI><Q><HI>Then shall the</HI> King <HI>say to them on his</HI> Right-hand, <HI>Come ye blessed Children of</HI> my Father, <HI>inhe∣rit the Kingdom</HI> prepared <HI>for you from the</HI> Foundation <HI>of the World.—For I was an</HI> hun∣gry, <HI>and ye gave me</HI> Meat. <HI>I was</HI> thirsty, <HI>and ye gave me</HI> Drink. <HI>I was</HI> a Stranger, <HI>and ye</HI> took me in.

<P>But then they reply against <HI>this.</HI>—In the <HI>lat∣ter Part</HI> of the Chapter, say they, it is <HI>plain</HI> that Jesus Christ <HI>rejects</HI> and <HI>damns</HI> the <HI>others</HI> for <HI>not doing</HI> these Things.

<P>But that is <HI>no Consequence</HI> at all—For God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay justly <HI>damn</HI> any Man for <HI>omitting</HI> the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>east

<P><HI>Sirs,</HI> What <HI>think</HI> you?—<HI>Suppose</HI> I was to come and <HI>tell you,</HI> that you <HI>must intercede</HI> with <HI>Saints,</HI> for <HI>them</HI> to <HI>intercede</HI> with <HI>God</HI> for <HI>you,</HI>—would you not then say, I was <HI>justly</HI> reputed a <HI>Popish Missionary</HI> by some, and <HI>deservedly</HI> thrust out of the <HI>Synagogues</HI> by others?—I suppose you <HI>would.</HI> And <HI>why?

One more <HI>Absurdity</HI> I shall mention, that will follow from the <HI>denying this Doctrine,</HI> and I have done.</P>
<P>I remember a Story of a <HI>certain Prelate,</HI> who, after many Arguments <HI>in vain,</HI> urged to <HI>convince</HI> the <HI>Earl of Rochester</HI> of the <HI>invisible Realities</HI> of another World, took his Leave of <HI>his Lordship</HI> with some such Words as <HI>these:</HI>—<Q>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l, <HI>my Lord,</HI> says he, if there be <HI>no Hell,</HI> I am <HI>safe;</HI>—but, <HI>if</HI> there <HI>should be such a Thing,</HI> my Lord, as <HI>Hell,</HI> what will <HI>become</HI> of <HI>you?</HI></Q> I apply <HI>this</HI> to those that <HI>oppose</HI> the Doctrine <HI>now insisted on.</HI> If there be <HI>no such Thing</HI> as the Doc∣trine of an <HI>imputed Righteousness,</HI> those that <HI>hold it,</HI> and bring forth <HI>Fruit unto Holiness,</HI> are <HI>safe.</HI> But if there <HI>be such a Thing,</HI> (as there <HI>certainly is</HI>) what will become of <HI>you</HI> that <HI>deny</HI> it? It is no <HI>difficult Matter</HI> to determine.—<HI>Your Portion</HI> must be in the <HI>Lake</HI> of <HI>Fire</HI> and <HI>Brimstone</HI> for <HI>ever</HI> and <HI>ever,</HI> since you will <HI>rely upon</HI> your <HI>Works,</HI> by your <HI>Works</HI> you shall <HI>be judged.</HI>—They shall be <HI>weighed</HI> in the <HI>Ballance</HI> of the <HI>Sanctuary.</HI>—They will be found <HI>wanting.</HI>—By <HI>your Works</HI> therefore shall you be <HI>condemned;</HI> and <HI>you,</HI> being <HI>out</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> shall find <HI>God</HI> to your <HI>poor, wretched▪ Souls,</HI> a <HI>consuming</HI> Fire.—</P>
<P>The <HI>great</HI> STODDARD of <HI>Northampton</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> has therefore <HI>well intitled</HI> a Book which he wrote (and which I would take <HI>this</HI> Opportunity to <HI>recommend</HI>) <Q><HI>The Safety</HI> of <HI>Appearing</HI> in the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of Christ.</Q> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> For <HI>why</HI> should I lean upon a <HI>broken Reed,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I can have the <HI>Rock of Age<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> to stand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> <HI>never</HI> can be moved?</P>

his Son to Mankind. He began with the Pro∣mise in the Text, and this the Elect lived upon till the Time of <HI>Abraham.</HI>—To him God made further Discoveries of his eternal Counsel con∣cerning Man's Redemption—Afterwards, at sundry Times, and in divers Manners, God spoke to the Fathers by the Prophets, till at length the LORD JESUS <HI>himself was manifest in the Flesh,</HI> and came &amp; tabernacled amongst us.</P>
<P>This first Promise must certainly be but dark to our first Parents, in comparison of that great Light which we enjoy.—And yet, dark as it was, we may assure our selves they built upon it their Hopes of everlasting Salvation, and by that Faith were saved.</P>
<P>How they came to stand in need of this Pro∣mise, and what is the Extent and Meaning of it, I intend, God willing, to make the subject Matter of your present Meditation.</P>
<P>The Fall of Man is written in too legible Characters not to be understood—Those that deny it, by their denying, prove it.—The very Heathens confess'd and bewailed it—They could see the Streams of Corruption running through the whole Race of Mankind, but could not trace them to the Fountain-Head.—Before God gave a Revelation of his Son Man was a Riddle to himself—And <HI>Moses</HI> unfolds more▪ in this one Chapter (out of which the Text <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> taken) than all Mankind could have been capable of finding out of themselves, tho' they had studied to all Eternity.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="005311_0038_10180ED3B12D33F0"/>
In the foregoing Chapter, he had given us a full Account, how God spoke the World into Being; and especially how he formed Man of the Dust of the Earth and breathed into him the Breath of Life, so that he became a living Soul.—A Council of the Trinity was called concerning the Formation of this lovely Crea∣ture.—The Result of that Council was, <HI>Let us make Man in our Image after our Likeness.—"So God created Man in his own Image, in the Image of God created he him."—Moses</HI> remarkably re∣peats the Words, that we might take particular. Notice of our divine Original.—Never was so much express'd in so few Words.—None but a Man inspired could have done so. But it is re∣markable, that tho' <HI>Moses</HI> mentions our being made in the <HI>Image of God,</HI> yet he mentions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but <HI>twice,</HI> and that, as it were, in a transient Manner, as tho' he would have said, <Q>Man was made in Honour, God made him upright▪ <HI>in the Image of God Male and Female created he them.</HI> But Man so soon fell, and became like the Beasts that perish, nay, like the Devil himself, that it is scarce worth men∣tioning.</Q></P>
<P>How soon Man fell after he was created, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not told us, and therefore, to fix any Time, is to be wise above what is written.—And, I think▪ they who suppose that Man fell the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Day in which he was made, have no sufficient Ground for their Opinion.—The many Things which are crouded together in the former <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, the Formation of <HI>Adam's</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his

giving Names to the Beasts, and his being put into the Garden which God had planted, I think require a longer Space of Time than a Day to be transacted in.—However, all agree in this, "Man stood not long." How long, or how short a while, I will not take upon me to deter∣mine.—It more concerns us to inquire, how he came to fall from his Stedfastness, and what was the Rise and Progress of the Temptation which prevailed over him.—The Account given us in this Chapter concerning it, is very full, and it may do us much Service, under God, to make some Remarks upon it.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Now the Serpent,</HI> says the sacred Historian, <HI>was more subtle than any Beast of the Field which the</HI> LORD GOD <HI>had made, and he said unto the Woman, yea, hath</HI> GOD <HI>said, ye shall not eat of every Tree of the Garden.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Tho' this was a real Serpent, yet he that spoke was no other than the Devil; from hence, perhaps, called the old Serpent, because he took Possession of the Serpent when he came to be∣guile our first Parents—The Devil envied the Happiness of Man, who was made, as some think, to supply the Place of the fallen Angels—God made Man upright, and with full Power to stand if he would—He was just, therefore, in suffering him to be tempted—If he fell, he had no one to blame except himself—But how must <HI>Satan</HI> effect his Fall?—He cannot do it by his Power, he attempts it therefore by Policy—He take<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Possession of a Serpent, which was more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> all the Beasts of the Field, which the
<PB N="33" REF="005311_0040_10180EDAD4C36E00"/>
Lord God had made; so that Men that are full of Subtilty, but have no Piety, are only Ma∣chines for the Devil to work upon, just as he pleases.</P>
<P><HI>"And he said unto the Woman."</HI>—Here is an Instance of his Subtilty—He says unto the Wo∣man, the weaker Vessel, and when she was alone from her Husband, and therefore was more liable to be overcome—<Q><HI>Yea, hath God said, ye shall not eat of every Tree of the Garden?</HI></Q> These Words are certainly spoken in Answer to something which the Devil either saw or heard—In all Probability, the Woman was now near the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. (For we shall find her, by and by, plucking an Apple from it) perhaps she might be looking at, and wondering what there was in that Tree more than the others, that she and her Husband should be forbidden to taste of it—<HI>Satan</HI> seeing this, and coveting to draw her into a Parley with him, (for if the Devil can persuade us not to resist, but to commune with him, he hath gained a great Point) he says, <Q><HI>Yea, hath God said, ye shall not eat of every Tree in the Gar∣den?</HI></Q>—The first Thing he does, is to per∣suade her, if possible, to entertain hard Thoughts of God—This is his general Way of dealing with God's Children—<Q>Yea, says he, hath God said, ye shall not eat of every Tree of the Garden? What! hath God planted a Garden, and placed you in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of it only to teaze and perplex you? Hath he planted a Garden, and yet forbid you mak∣ing

Use of any of the Fruits of it at all?</Q> It was impossible for him to ask a more insnaring Question, in order to gain his End: For <HI>Eve,</HI> was here seemingly obliged to answer, and vin∣dicate God's Goodness. And, therefore,—</P>
<P><HI>Ver.</HI> 2. The Woman said unto the Serpent, <Q><HI>We may eat of the Fruit of the Trees of the Garden: (Ver. 3.) of the Fruit of the Tree which is in the midst of the Garden, God hath said, ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it▪ lest ye die.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The former Part of the Answer was good, <Q>We may eat of the Fruit of the Trees of the Garden, God has not forbid us eating of <HI>every</HI> Tree of the Garden. No, we may eat of the Fruit of the Trees in the Garden, (and, it should seem even of the Tree of Life, which was as a Sacrament to Man in a State of Innocence) there is only one Tree in the Midst of the Garden, of which God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, <HI>lest ye die.</HI></Q>—Here she begins to warp, and Sin begins to conceive in her Heart.—Already she has contracted some of the Serpent's Poison, by talking with him, which she ought not to have done at all.

<P>To give Strength and Force to this Tempta∣tion, in all Probability, <HI>Satan,</HI> or the Serpent, at this Time, pluck'd an Apple from the Tree, and eat it before <HI>Eve,</HI>—by which <HI>Eve</HI> might be induced to think, that the Sagacity and Power of Speech, which the Serpent had above the other Beasts, must be owing, in a great Mea∣sure, to his eating that Fruit; and, therefore, if he received so much Improvement, she might also expect a like Benefit from it.

For, talking of the second Co∣venant, in his Preface concerning <HI>caring for the Soul,</HI> says he, <Q>This second Covenant was made with <HI>Adam,</HI> and us in him, presently after the Fall, and is briefly contained in these Words—<HI>Gen.</HI> iii. 15. where God de∣clares <HI>the Seed of the Woman shall break the Serpent's Head;</HI> and this was made up, as the first was, of some Mercies to be afforded by God, and some Duties to be performed by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</Q>—This is exceeding false Divinity—For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Words are not spoken to <HI>Adam</HI>—They
<PB N="48" REF="005311_0055_10180F0331C833A0"/>
are directed only to the Serpent—<HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> stood by as Criminals, and God could not treat with them, because they had broken his Covenant. And it is so far from being a Cove∣nant, wherein <Q>some Mercies are to be af∣forded by God, and some Duties to be per∣formed by us,</Q> that here is not a Word looking that Way—It's only a Declaration of a free Gift of Salvation through Jesus Christ our Lord—God the Father, and God the Son, had enter'd into a Covenant concerning the Salvation of the Elect from all Eternity; wherein God the Father promised, that if the Son would offer his Soul a Sacrifice for Sin, he should see his Seed—Now this is an open Revelation of this secret Covenant, and therefore God speaks in the most positive Terms, <HI>It shall bruise thy Head, and thou shalt bruise his Heel.</HI>—The first <HI>Adam</HI> God had treated with before—He proved false—God therefore, to secure the second Covenant from being broken, puts it into the Hands of the second <HI>Adam,</HI> the Lord from Heaven—<HI>Adam</HI> after the Fall, stood no longer as our Represen∣tative—He and <HI>Eve</HI> were only private Persons, as we are, and were only to lay hold on the Declaration of Mercy contained in this Promise by Faith, (as they really did) and by that they were saved.—I do not say, but we are to be∣lieve and obey, if we are everlastingly saved—Faith and Obedience are Conditions, if we on mean that they in order go before our Salvation but I deny that these are proposed by God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Adam,</HI> or that God treats with him on this Pro∣mise,
<PB N="49" REF="005311_0056_10180F09B42CEB18"/>
as he did before the Fall under the Cove∣nant of Works. For, how could that be, when <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> were now Prisoners at the Bar, without Strength to perform any Conditions at all.—The Truth is this—God, as a Reward of Christ's Sufferings, promised to give the Elect Faith and Repentance, in order to bring them to eternal Life—And both these, and every Thing else necessary for their everlasting Happiness, are infallibly secured to them in this Promise, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mr. BOSTON, an excellent <HI>Scots</HI> Divine, sweetly and clearly shews, in a Book <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tituled, <HI>"A View of the Covenant of Grace."</HI>—</P>
<P>This is, by no Means, an unnecessary Dis∣tinction—It's a Matter of great Importance—For want of knowing this, People have been so long misled—They have been taught that they must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o so and so, as tho' they were under a Covenant of Works, and then for DOING this, they should be saved.—This is plainly the whole D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t of the Book wrongly intitled, <HI>The Whole Duty of Man</HI>—Whereas, on the contrary, Peo∣ple should be taught, that the Lord Jesus was the second <HI>Adam,</HI> with whom the Father enter'd into Covenant for fallen Man—That they can now do nothing of or for themselves, and should therefore come to God, beseeching him to give them Faith, by which they shall be enabled to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay hold on the Righteousness of Christ and that Faith they will shew forth by their Works, out of Love and Gratitude to the ever blessed Je<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> their most glorious Redeemer, for what he has done for their Souls—This is a consistent

scriptural Scheme. Without holding this, we must run into one of these two bad Extreme▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mean <HI>Antinomianism</HI> on the one Hand, or <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>mianism</HI> on the other—From both which may the Good Lord deliver us!—</P>
<P>But to proceed: By the <HI>Seed of the Woman,</HI> we are here to understand the LORD JESUS CHRIST, who, tho' very God of very God▪ was for us Men and our Salvation, to have Body prepared for him by the Holy Ghost, and to be born of a pure Virgin, and by his Obedi∣ence and Death make an Atonement for Man's Transgression, and bring in an everlasting Righ∣teousness, work in them a new Nature, and thereby bruise the Serpent's Head, <HI>i. e.</HI> destroy his Power and Dominion over them—By the <HI>Serpent's Seed,</HI> we are to understand the Devil and all his Children, who should be permitted by God to tempt and sift his Children. But blessed be God, he can reach no further than our Heel.—</P>
<P>Tis not to be doubted but <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> understood this Promise in this Sense; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> plain; in the latter Part of the Chapter, Sacrifices were instituted—For, from whence should th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Skins come, but from Beasts slain for Sacrifice, of which God made them Coats?—We find also <HI>Abel,</HI> as well as <HI>Cain,</HI> offering Sacrifice in the next Chapter: And the Apostle tells us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> did it <HI>by Faith,</HI> no doubt in this Promise—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Eve,</HI> when <HI>Cain</HI> was born, said, <HI>I have gotten a Man from the</HI> LORD, or, (as Mr. HENR<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> observes, it may be render'd) <HI>I have gotten a

<P>This Promise was literally fulfilled in the Per∣son of our Lord Jesus Christ—Satan bruised his Heel, when he tempted him for forty Days together in the Wilderness—He bruised his Heel, when he raised up strong Persecution against him, during the Time of his publick Ministry—He, in an especial Manner, bruised his Heel, when our Lord complained, that his <HI>Soul was exceeding sorrowful, even unto Death <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and he sweat great Drops of Blood falling upon the Ground,</HI> when praying in the Garden—He bruised his Heel, when he put it into the Heart of <HI>Judas</HI> to betray him:—And he bruised him yet most of all, when his Emissaries nailed him to an accursed Tree, and our Lord cried out, <HI>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken one?</HI>—Ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; in all this, the blessed Jesus, the <HI>Seed of the Woman,</HI> bruised his accursed Head—For, in that he was tempted, he was able to <HI>succour those that are tempted.</HI> By <HI>his Stripes we are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪</HI> The Chastisement of our Peace was

cannot properly be said to be <HI>in</HI> CHRIST, much less to <HI>live godly</HI> in Him.—To be in CHRIST merely by Baptism, and an outward Profession, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not to be in HIM in the strict Sense of the Word—No: <HI>They that are in CHRIST are New Creatures, old Things are passed away, and all Things are become new</HI> in their Hearts.—Their Life is hid with CHRIST in God.—Their Souls daily feed on the invisible Realities of another World—To <HI>live godly in</HI> CHRIST, is to make the Divine Will, and not our own, the sole Principle of all our Thoughts, Words &amp; Actions; so that, <HI>whether we eat or drink, or whatsoever we do, we do all to the Glory of God.</HI>—Those who <HI>live godly in</HI> CHRIST, may not so much be said to <HI>live,</HI> as CHRIST, to <HI>live</HI> in them—He is their ALPHA and OMEGA, their First and Last, their Beginning and End—They are led by his Spirit, as a Child is led by the Hand of its Fa∣ther, and are willing to follow the Lamb <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thersoever he leads them—They hear, know, and obey his Voice—Their Affections are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on Things above—Their Hopes are full of Im∣mortality—Their Citizenship is in Heaven—Being born again of God, they habitually live to, and daily walk with God—They are <HI>pare in Heart,</HI> and in short, from a Principle of FAITH in CHRIST, holy in all Manner of Conversa∣tion and Godliness.</P>

<P>What is the Meaning of the Word PERSE∣CUTION, and how many Kinds there are of it, I come now to consider.</P>
<P>The Word PERSECUTION is derived from a <HI>Greek</HI> Word signifying to <HI>pursue,</HI> and gene∣rally implies <Q>pursuing a Person for the Sake of his Goodness, or God's Good-will to him.</Q> The first Kind of it is that of the <HI>Heart</HI>—We have an early Example of this in that wicked One <HI>Cain,</HI> who, because the Lord had Respect to <HI>Abel</HI> and his Offering, and not to him and his Offering, was very wroth, his Countenance fell, and at length he cruelly slew his envied Brother.—Thus the <HI>Pharisees</HI> hated and persecuted our Lord long before they laid hold on him: And our Lord mentions being inwardly hated of Men, as one Kind of PER∣SECUTION his Disciples were to undergo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> This Heart—Enmity (if I may so term it) is the Root of all other Kinds of PERSECUTION▪ and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, in some Degree or other, to be found in the Soul of every unregenerated Man▪ and Numbers are guilty of this Persecution who never have it in their Power to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any other Way. Nay, Numbers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e carrie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> out actually to put in Practice all other Degree of Persecution, was not the Name of <HI>Persecu∣tion</HI> become odious among Mankind, and did

they not hereby run the Hazard of losing their Reputation. Alas! how many at the Great Day, whom we know not now will be convic∣ted and condemned, that all their Life long harboured a secret evil Will against <HI>ZION!</HI>—They may now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kreen it before Men; but God seeth the Enmity of their Hearts, and will judge them as <HI>Persecutors</HI> at the great and ter∣rible <HI>Day of Judgment!</HI></P>
<P>A second Degree of <HI>Persecution,</HI> is that of the <HI>Tongue—for out of the Abundance of the Heart, the Mouth speaketh</HI>—Many, I supp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, think it no Harm to shoot out Arrows, even bitter Words, against the Disciples of the Lord—They scatter their Fire-Brands, Arrows and Death, saying, <HI>Are we not in Sport?</HI>—But however they may esteem it, in God's Account Evil speaking is a high Degree of <HI>Persecution.</HI> Thus <HI>Ishmael'</HI>s m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cking <HI>Isaa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> in the Old, is termed <HI>persecuting</HI> him in the New-Testament—<HI>Blessed are ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪</HI> says our Lord, <HI>When Men shall revel you and</HI> persecute <HI>you, and shall say all Manner of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> against you falsely for my Names Sake.</HI>—From whence we may gather, that <HI>Reviling,</HI> and speaking all Manner of Evil <HI>falsly</HI> for CHRIST'S Sake, is a high Degree of <HI>Persecution.</HI>—For a <HI>good Name,</HI> says the wise Man, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> better that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ointment,</HI> and, to many, is dearer tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>itself</HI>—It's a great Breach of the sixth Commandment to slander any one, but to speak <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of and slander the Disciples of CHRIST, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> because they are his Disciples, must be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> provoking in the Sight of God, and such
<PB N="64" REF="005311_0071_1018101BCA8EF508"/>
who are guilty of it (without Repentance) will find that JESUS CHRIST will call them to an Account, and punish them for all their ungodly and hard Speeches in a Lake of Fire and Brim∣stone—This shall be their Portion to drink.</P>
<P>The third and last Kind of <HI>Persecution,</HI> is that which expresses itself in <HI>Actions</HI>—As when wicked Men separate the Children of God from their Company. <HI>Blessed are ye,</HI> says our Lord, <HI>when they shall separate you from their Company</HI>—or expose them to Church-Censures. <HI>They shall put you out of their Synagogues.</HI>—Or in threatning and prohibiting them from making an open Profession of his Religion or Worship, or Mi∣nisters from preaching his Word, as the <HI>High Priests</HI> threatned the Apostles, and forbad them <HI>any more to speak in the Name of</HI> JESUS. And PAUL <HI>breathed out Threatnings and Slaughters against the Disciples of the Lord</HI>—Or when they call them into Courts. <HI>You shall be called before Governors,</HI> says our Lord.—Or when they fine, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mprison, or punish them, by Confiscation of Goods, cruel Scourging, and, lastly, Death itself.</P>
<P>It would be impossible to enumerate in what various Shapes <HI>Persecution</HI> has appeared.—It's a many-headed Monster, insatiable as Hell, cruel as the Grave, and, what is worse, it generally appears under the Cloak of Religion.—But, cruel, insatiable, and horrid as it is, they that live <HI>godly in</HI> CHRIST JESUS, must expect to suffer and encounter with in all its Forms.</P>
<P>This is what we are to make good under our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> general Head.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="005311_0072_1018101D4F8CB298"/>
And <HI>first,</HI> This appears from the whole T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r of our Lord's Doctrine—We will begin with his Divine Sermon on the Mount—<HI>Blessed,</HI> says he, <HI>are they which are persecuted for Righte∣ousness Sake; for theirs is the Kingdom of Hea∣ven.</HI> So that, if our Lord spoke Truth, we are not so blessed, as to have an Interest in the King∣dom of Heaven, unless we are or have been <HI>persecuted for Righteousness Sake</HI>—Nay, our Lord (it's remarkable) employs three Verses in this Beatitude, and only one in each of the others; not only to shew, that it was a Thing which Men (as Men) are unwilling to believe, but also the necessary Consequence of it upon our being Christians.—This is likewise evident from all those Passages, wherein our Lord informs us, that he came upon the Earth not to send <HI>Peace</HI> but a <HI>Sword,</HI> and that the <HI>Father-in-law</HI> should be against the <HI>Mother-in-law,</HI> and that a Man's <HI>Foes</HI> should be those of his <HI>own Houshold.</HI> Pas∣sages, which tho' confined by false Prophets <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; the first, I am persuaded will be verified by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Experience of all true Christians in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> every Age of the Church.—It would be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to recount all the Places, wherein our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord forewarns his Disciples, that they should be called before Rulers, thrust out of Synagogues, nay, that the Time would come, wherein Men should think they did God Service to kill them.—For this Reason he so frequently declared, that unless a Man <HI>forsake all that he had, and even hated Life itself, he could not be his Disciple<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪</HI> And therefore it is worthy our Observation▪
<PB N="66" REF="005311_0073_1018101EDD43AB30"/>
that in that remarkable Passage, wherein <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lord makes such an extensive Promise to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se who <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ft all for him,</HI> cautiously inserts PERSE∣CUTION. <HI>And</HI> JESUS <HI>answered and said, Ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y I say unto you, there is no Man that hath le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t House, or Brethren, or Sisters, or Father, or Mo∣ther, or Wife, or Children, or Lands for my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and the</HI> Gospel's, <HI>but he shall receive an Hundred-fold</HI> now <HI>in this Tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Houses and Brethren, and Sisters and Mothers, and Children and La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>,</HI> with <HI>Persecutions</HI> (the Word is in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Number, including all Kinds of <HI>Persecution</HI>) and <HI>in the World to come eternal Life.</HI>—He that hath <HI>Ears to hear,</HI> let him <HI>hear</HI> what CHRIST says in all these Passages, and then confess, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>all who will live godly in</HI> CHRIST JESUS, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> suffer</HI> PERSECUTION.</P>
<P>As this is proved from our Lord's Doctrine; so it is no less evident from his Life. F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w him from the Manger to the Cross, and see whether any <HI>Persecution</HI> was like that which the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of God, the Lord of Glory, underwent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> here on Earth—How was he hated by wicked Men?—How often would that Hatred have excited them to take hold of him, had it not been for Fear of the People?—How was he reviled, counted and called a Blasphemer, a Wine-Bibber, a Samaritan, nay, a Devil, and, in one Word, had all Manner of Evil spoken against him falsely?—What Contradiction of Sinners did he endure against himself?—How did Men seperat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from his Company, and were ashamed to walk with him openly? Insomuch
<PB N="67" REF="005311_0074_10181027E3E289E8"/>
that he once said to his own Disciples, <HI>Will you also go away?</HI>—Again—How was he stoned, thrust out of the Synagogues, arraigned as a Deceiver of the People, a seditious and pestilent Fellow, an Enemy to <HI>Caesar,</HI> and as such scourg∣ed, blindfolded, spit upon, and at length con∣demned and nailed to an accursed Tree?—Thus was the Master persecuted—Thus did the Lord suffer—And the Servant is not above his Master, nor the Disciple above his Lord—<HI>If they have</HI> persecuted <HI>me, they will also</HI> perse∣cute <HI>you,</HI> says the blessed JESUS. And again, <HI>Every Man that is perfect,</HI> that is, a true Chri∣stian, <HI>must be as his Master, i. e.</HI> suffer as he did. For in all these Things our Lord has led us an Example, that we should follow his Steps: And therefore, God forbid that any, who would <HI>live godly in</HI> CHRIST JESUS, should hencefor∣ward expect to escape suffering <HI>Persecution.</HI></P>
<P>But further: Not only our Lord's Example, but the Example of all the Saints that ever lived▪ evidently demonstrates the Truth of the Apos∣tles Assertion in the Text. How soon was <HI>Abel</HI> made a Martyr for his Religion?—How was <HI>Isaac</HI> mocked by the Son of the Bond-wo∣man?—And what a large Catalogue of suffering Old-Testament Saints have we recorded in the 11th Chapter of the <HI>Hebrews?</HI>—Read the <HI>Acts of the Apostles,</HI> and see how the first Christians were threatned, sto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, imprisoned, scourged, and persecuted even unto Death.—Examine Church-History in After-Ages, and you wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Murder of the Innocents by <HI>Herod,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="68" REF="005311_0075_10181029A4C3BE40"/>
but an Earnest of the innocent Blood which should be shed for the Name of JESUS—Examine the Experience of Saints now living on Earth, and if it were possible to consult the <HI>Spirits of just Men made perfect,</HI> I am persuaded each would concur with the Apostle in asserting, that <HI>all who will live godly in</HI> CHRIST JESUS, <HI>shall suffer</HI> PERSECUTION.</P>
<P>For how can it be otherwise in the very Na∣ture of Things?—Ever since the Fall there has been an irreconcileable Enmity put between the Seed of the Woman and the Seed of the Serpent. Wicked Men hate God, and there∣fore cannot but hate those who are like him. They hate to be reformed, and therefore must hate and persecute those, who, by a contrary Behaviour, testify of them, that their Deeds are Evil—Besides, Pride of Heart leads Men to per∣secute the Servants of <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI>—If they commend them, they are afraid of being asked,—Why do not you follow them?"—And therefore because they dare not imitate, tho' they may sometimes be even forced to approve their Way, yet Pride and Envy make them turn Persecutors.—Hence it is, that as it was for∣merly, so it is now, and so will it be to the End of Time—<HI>He that is born after the</HI> FLESH, the natural Man, does and <HI>will</HI> persecute <HI>him that is born after the</HI> SPIRIT, the regenerate Man▪ Because Christians are not of the World, but Christ hath chosen them out of the World, therefore the World <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll hate them—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ected against this Doctrine, <Q>that we now
<PB N="69" REF="005311_0076_1018102BA3AC62A0"/>
live in a Christian World, and therefore must not expect such Persecution as formerly;</Q> I answer, <Q>All are not Christians that are called so; and till the Heart is changed, the Enmity against God which is the Root of all Persecution) remains;</Q> and conse∣quently Christians, falsely so called, will perse∣cute as well as others.—I observed therefore, in the Beginning of this Discourse, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> mentions those that had a Form of Religion, as persons of whom <HI>Timothy</HI> had Need be chiefly aware—For, as our Lord and his Apostles were mostly persecuted by their Countrymen the <HI>Jews,</HI> so we must expect the like Usage from the Formalists of our own Nation, the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> who seem to be religious.—For the most horrid and barbarous <HI>Persecutions</HI> have been carried on by those who have called themselves Christians <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> witness the Days of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and the Fines, Banishments, and Imprisonments of the Children of God in the last Century, and the bitter, irre∣concileable Hatred that appear in Thousands who call themselves Christians, even in the present Days wherein we live.</P>
<P>Persons, who argue against Persecution now, are not sufficiently sensible of the bitter Enmity of the Heart of every unregenerate Man against God. For my own Part, I am so far from wondering that Christians are persecuted, that I wonder our Streets do not run with the Blood of the Saints—Was Men's Power equal to their Wills, such a horrid Spectacle would soon appear.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="005311_0077_1018102E27E35590"/>
<HI>Persecution</HI> is necessery in respect to the Godly themselves—If we have not all Manner of Evil spoken of us, how can we know whether we love Contempt, and seek only that Honour which cometh from above?—If we have not Persecutors, how can our Passive Graces be kept in Exercise?—How can many Christian Precepts be put into Practice?—How can we love, pray for, and do good to those who de∣spitefully use us?—How can we overcome Evil with Good?—In short, how can we know we love God better than Life itself?—St. <HI>Paul</HI> was sensible of all this, and therefore so posi∣tively and peremptorily asserts, that <HI>all that will live godly in</HI> CHRIST JESUS <HI>must suffer</HI> PER∣SECUTION.</P>
<P>Not that I affirm, <Q>All are persecuted in a like Degree.</Q> No: This would be con∣trary both to Scripture and Experience. But tho' all Christians are not really called to suffer every Kind of <HI>Persecution,</HI> yet all Christians are liable thereto: And notwithstanding some may live in more peaceful Times of the Church than other, yet all Christians, in all Ages, will find by their own Experience, that, whether they act in a private or publick Capacity, they must, in some Degree or other, suffer <HI>Persecution.</HI></P>
<P>Here then I would make a Pause, and, by Way of Application, exhort all Persons first to stand awhile and examine themselves.—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or, by what has be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> said, you may gather one Mark, whereby you may judge, whether you are Chri∣stians or not?—Were you ever persecuted for

Righteousness Sake? If not, you never yet lived godly in Christ our Lord—Whatever you may say to the contrary, the inspired Apostle, in the Words of the Text (the Truth of which, I think, I have sufficiently proved) positively asserts, that <HI>all that will godly in</HI> HIM, <HI>must suffer</HI> Persecution—Not that all that are perse∣cuted are real Christians—For many sometimes suffer, and are persecuted, on other Accounts than for Righteousness Sake—The great Ques∣tion therefore is, <Q>Whether you were ever persecuted for living <HI>godly?</HI></Q>—You may boast (as perhaps you may think) of your great Prudence and Sagacity (and indeed these are excellent Things) and glory because you have not run such Lengths, and made yourselves so singular, and liable to such Contempt, as some others have.—But alas! This is not a Mark of your being of a <HI>Christian,</HI> but of a <HI>Laodi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ean</HI> Spirit, neither hot nor cold, and fit only to be spewed out of the Mouth of God—That which you call Prudence, is only Cowardice, dreadful Hypocrisy, Pride of Heart, which makes you dread Contempt, and afraid to give up your Reputation for God—You are ashamed of Christ and his Gospel, and in all Probability, was he to appear a second Time upon Earth, in Words, as well as Works, you would deny him—Awake therefore, all ye that live only formally in <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> and no longer seek that Honour which cometh of Man.—I do not desire you to court, but I intreat you to live godly, and fear not Contempt for the Sake of <HI>Jesus

I have met with many unhappy Souls, who have drawn back unto Per∣dition, and have afterwards accounted me their Enemy, for dealing faithfully with them, tho' once, if it were possible, they would have <HI>plucked out their own Eyes, and have given them unto me.</HI>—Sit down therefore, I beseech you, and seriously count the Cost, and ask yourselves again and again, whether you <HI>count all Things but.

<P>I could proceed, but I am conscious in this Part of my Discourse; I ought more particularly to speak to myself, knowing that Satan has de∣sired to have me, that he may <HI>sift me as Wheat.</HI> I know I must (How can it be avoided?) <HI>suffer great Things for Christ's</HI> Name Sake—Without a Spirit of Prophecy, we may easily discern the Sighs of the Times. <HI>Persecution </HI> is even at the Doors—The Tabernacle of the Lord is already driven into the Wilderness—The Ark of the Lord is fallen into the unhallowed Hands of uncir∣cumcised <HI>Philistians.</HI> They have long since put us out of their Synagogues, and High-Priests have been calling on Civil Magistrates to exert their Authority against the Disciples of the Lord.—Men in Power have been <HI>breathing out

<P>Brethren therefore, whether in the Ministry or not, I beseech you, <HI>pray for me,</HI> that I may never suffer justly, as an Evil-Doer, but only for Righteousness Sake—Oh! Pray that I may not deny my Lord in any wise, but that I may joyfully follow him, both to Prison and to Death if he is pleased to call me to seal his Truths with my Blood—Be not ashamed of Christ, or of his Gospel, tho' I should become a Prisoner of the Lord—Tho' I am bound, the Word of God will not be bound—No, an open, an effectual Door is opened for preaching the everlasting Gospel, and Men or Devils shall never be able to prevail against it—Only pray, that whether it be in Life or Death, Christ may be glorified in me.—Then I shall rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</P>
<P>And now, to whom shall I address myself next?—To those, <Q>who persecute their Neigh∣bours for living godly in CHRIST JESUS.</Q> But, what shall I say to your Howl and weep for the Miseries that shall come upon you—For a little while the Lord permits you to ride over the Heads of his People; but by and by, Death will arrest you, Judgment will find you, and Jesus Christ shall put a Question to you, which will strike you dumb.

<P>THE great St. <HI>Paul,</HI> in one of his Epistles informs us, that <HI>whatsoever was writ∣ten aforetime was written for our Learn∣ing, that we through Patience and Comfort of the Holy Scripture might have Hope</HI>—And as with∣out Faith it is impossible to please God, or be accepted in Jesus, the Son of his Love, we may be assured, that whatever Instances of a more than common Faith are recorded in the Book of God, they were more immediately designed by the Holy Spirit for the Learning and Imita∣tion

of us, upon who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Ends of the World are come.—For this Reason, the Author of the Epistle to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> in the 11th Chapter, mentions such a noble Catalogue of Old-Testa∣ment Saints and Martyrs, <HI>who subdued King∣doms, wrought Righteousness, stopped the Mouth, of Lions,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and are gone before us to inherit the Promises.</HI> A sufficient Confutation, I think, of their Error, who lightly esteem the Old-Testament Saints, and would not have them mentioned to Christians, as Persons whose Faith and Patience we are called upon more imme∣diately to follow—If this was true, the Apostle would never have produced such a Cloud of Witnesses out of the Old Testament, to excite the Christians of the first, and consequently purest Age of the Church, to continue stedfast and unmoveable in the Profession of their Faith.—Amidst this Catalogue of Saints, methinks the Patriarch <HI>Abraham</HI> shines the brightest, and differs from the others, as one Star differeth from another Star in Glory—For he shone with such distinguished Lustre, that he was called the <HI>Friend of God,</HI> the <HI>Father of the Faithful,</HI> and those who believe on Christ, are said to be Sons and Daughters of, and to be blessed with faith∣ful <HI>Abraham</HI>—Many Trials of his Faith did God send this great and good Man, after he had commanded him to get out from his Country, and from his Kindred, unto a Land which he should shew him—But his last was the most severe of all—I mean that of offering up his only Son—This, by the Divine Assistance, I

propose to make the Subject of your present Meditation, and, by Way of Conclusion, to draw some practical Inferences from the Ob∣servations that God shall enable me to draw from this instructive Story.</P>
<P>The sacred Penman begins the Narrative thus. <HI>Ver.</HI> 1. <Q><HI>And it came to pass, after these Things, God did tempt</HI> Abraham</Q>—<HI>After these Things,</HI> that is, after he had under∣went many severe Trials before, after he was old, full of Days, and might flatter himself per∣haps that the Troubles and Toils of Life were now finished—<HI>After these Things, God did tempt</HI> Abraham—Christians, you know not what Trials you may meet with before you die.—Notwithstanding you may have suffered, and been tried much already, yet, it may be, a greater Measure is still behind, which you are to fill up—<HI>Be not high-minded, but fear</HI>—Our last Trials, in all Probability, will be the greatest. And we can never say our Warfare is accom∣plished, or our Trials finished, till we bow down our Heads, and give up the Ghost—<Q><HI>And it came to pass, after these Things, that God did tempt</HI> Abraham.</Q></P>
<P><HI>"God did tempt</HI> Abraham"—But can the Scripture contradict itself? Does not St. <HI>James</HI> tell us, <HI>that God tempts no Man?</HI> And God does tempt no Man to Evil, or on Purpose to draw him into Sin. For when a Man is thus tempted, he is drawn away of his own Heart's Lust, and enticed—But in another Sense God may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid to tempt—I mean to try <HI>his Ser∣vants,</HI>
<PB N="84" REF="005311_0091_101811B92C8EEFC8"/>
and in this Sense we are to understand that Passage of St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> where we are told, that <HI>Jesus was led up by the Spirit</HI> (the <HI>good Spi∣rit) into the Wilderness, to be tempted of the De∣vil</HI>—And our Lord, in that excellent Form <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Prayer which he has been pleased to prescribe us, does not require us to pray, that we may not absolutely be led into Temptation, but de∣livered from the Evil of it—Whereby we may plainly infer, that God sees it fit sometimes to lead us into Temptation, that is, to bring us into such Circumstances, as will try our Faith, and other Christian Graces—In this Sense we are to understand the Expression before us—<HI>God did tempt or try</HI> Abraham.</P>
<P>How God was pleased to reveal his Will at this Time to his faithful Servant, whether by the <HI>Shechinah,</HI> or <HI>Divine Appearance,</HI> or by a small still Voice, as he spoke to <HI>Elijah,</HI> or by a Whisper, like that of the Spirit to <HI>Philip,</HI> when he commanded him to go join himself to the <HI>Eunuch'</HI>s Chariot, we are not told, nor is it material to enquire—It's enough that we are informed, God said unto him <HI>Abraham,</HI> and that <HI>Abraham</HI> knew it was the Voice of God—For <HI>he said, Behold here I am</HI>—Oh! what a holy Familiarity (if I may so speak) is there be∣tween God, and those holy Souls that are united to him by Faith in Christ Jesus! God, says <HI>Abraham,</HI> and <HI>Abraham</HI> said (it should seem without the least Surprise) <HI>Behold, here I am</HI>—Being reconciled to God by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Obe∣dience of Christ, which he rejoiced in, and saw

by Faith afar off—He did not, like guilty <HI>Adam,</HI> seek the <HI>Trees of the Garden</HI> to hide himself from, but takes Pleasure in conversing with God, and talketh with him, as a Man talketh with his Friend—Oh! that christless Sinners knew what it is to have Fellowship with the Father and the Son! They would envy the Happiness of Saints, and count it all Joy to be termed <HI>Enthusiasts,</HI> and Fools for Christ's Sake.</P>
<P>But what does God say to <HI>Abraham? Ver.</HI> 2. <Q><HI>Take now thy Son, thine only Son </HI> Isaac, <HI>whom thou lovest, and get thee into the Land of</HI> M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riah, <HI>and offer him there for a Burnt-offering upon one of the Mountains which I shall tell thee of.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Every Word deserves our particular Obser∣vation—Whatever he was to do, he must do it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, immediately, without conferring with Flesh and Blood—But what must he do? <HI>Take now thy Son</HI>—Had God said, take now a First∣ling, or choicest Lamb or Beast of thy Flock, and offer it up for a Burnt-offering, it would not have appeared so ghastly; but for God to say, <HI>Take now thy Son, and offer him up for a Burnt-offering,</HI> one would have imagined was enough to stagger the strongest Faith—But this is not all—It must not only be a Son, but <HI>thine only Son</HI> Isaac, <HI>whom thou lovest</HI>—If it must be a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and not a Beast, that must be offered, why <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Ishmael</HI> do, the Son of the Bond-Wo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> No, it must be his <HI>only Son,</HI> the Heir of all Things, his <HI>Isaac,</HI> by Interpretation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ the Son of his old Age, in whom his
<PB N="86" REF="005311_0093_101811BE3A600FB0"/>
Soul delighted, <HI>whom thou lovest,</HI> says God, in whose Life his own was wrapped up—And this Son, this <HI>only Son,</HI> this <HI>Isaac,</HI> the <HI>Son of his Love,</HI> must be taken now, even now, without Delay, and be offered up by his own Father, for a Burnt-offering, upon one of the Moun∣tains of the which God would tell him.</P>
<P>Well might the Apostle, speaking of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Man of God, say, that <HI>against Hope he believed in Hope, and being strong in Faith, gave Glory to God</HI>—For, had he not been blessed with Faith, which Man never before had, he must have re∣fused to comply with this severe Command—For how many Arguments might Nature suggest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o prove, that such a Command could never come from God? or to excuse himself from obeying it. <Q>What! might the good Man have said, butcher my own Child! it is contrary to the very Law of Nature—Much more to butcher my dear Son <HI>Isaac</HI>—in whose Seed God himself has assured me, that all the Families of the Earth shall be blessed—But supposing I could give up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Affections, and he willing to part with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, tho' I love <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so dearly▪ yet, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ him, what will become of God' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>—Besides, I am now like a City built upon a Hill—I shine as a <HI>Light on the World,</HI> in the midst of a crooked and perverse <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> says ration—How then shall I cause God's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> seem to be blasphemed, how shall I become a By—word among the Heathen, if they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪ I have committed a Cri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>

<P>But to return to the Patriarch <HI>Abraham</HI>—We observed before what plausible Objections he might have made—But he answered not a sin∣gle Word—No—without replying against his Maker—We are told, <HI>Ver.</HI> 3. that <Q><HI>Abraham rose up early in the Morning, and saddled his Ass, and took two of his young Men with him, and</HI> Isaac <HI>his Son, and clave the Wood for the Burnt-offering, and rose up and went unto the Place of which God had told him.</HI></Q></P>
<P>From this Verse we may gather, that God spoke to <HI>Abraham</HI> in a Dream, or Vision of the Night—For it is said, he <HI>rose up early</HI>—Per∣haps it was near the fourth Watch of the Night, just before Break of Day, when God said, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ke now thy Son</HI>—And <HI>Abraham</HI> rises up early to do so—As I doubt not but he used to rise early to offer up his Morning Sacrifice of Praise and Thanksgiving—It is often remarked of People in the Old Testament, that they rose early in the Morning, and particularly of our Lord in the New, that he rose a great while before Day to pray—The Morning be friends Devotion, and it People cannot use so much Self-denial, as to rise early to pray, I know not how they will be able to die at a Stake (if called to it) for Jesus Christ.</P>

<P>But will the Lord leave his poor Servant in this Distress?

but he was taken notice of for his Gift in Prayer. And yet it seemed before these three Days <HI>Saul</HI> never prayed in his Life—And why? Because, before these three Days, he never felt himself a <HI>condemned</HI> Creature—He was alive in his own Opinion, because without a Knowledge of the spiritual Meaning of the Law, he felt not a want of, and therefore before now, cried not after a Jesus, and consequently, tho' he might have said or made a Prayer (as many Pharisees do now a-days) he never prayed a Prayer.—But now, Behold! he <HI>prayeth indeed</HI>—And this was urged as one Reason why he was converted.—None of God's Children, as one observes, come into the World still-born—Prayer is the very Breath of the new Creature, and therefore if we are Prayerless we are Christless—If we never had the Spirit of Supplication, it is a sad Sign that we never had the Spirit of Grace in our Souls; and you may be assured you never did pray, unless you have felt your selves damnable Sinners, and the Want of Jesus to be your Saviour.—May the Lord, whom I serve in the Gospel of his dear Son, prick you all to the Heart, and may it be said of you all as it was of <HI>Saul,</HI> Behold, they pray!</P>

conversed with Christians in private, but he preached Christ publickly in the Synagogues Especially he insisted on the Divinity of our Lord, proving, notwithstanding his Humiliation, that he was really the Son of God.</P>
<P>But why did <HI>Saul</HI> preach Christ thus? Be∣cause he had felt the Power of Christ upon his own Soul—And here's the Reason why Christ is so seldom preached, and his Divinity so slightly insisted on in our Synagogues, 'tis because the Generality of those that pretend to preach him, never felt a saving Work of Conversion upon their own Souls—How can they preach, unless they are first taught of, and then sent by God? <HI>Saul</HI> did not preach Christ be∣fore he knew him, no more should any one else.—An unconverted Minister, tho' he could speak with the Tongues of Men and Angels, will be but as a sounding Brass and tinkling Cymbal to those whose Senses are exercised to discern spiri∣tual Things—Ministers that are unconverted, may talk and declaim of Christ, and prove from Books that he is the Son of God, but they can∣not preach with the Demonstration of the Spirit and with Power, unless they preach from Expe∣rience, and have had a Proof of his Divinity, by a Work of Grace wrought upon their own Souls—God forgive those, who lay Hands on an unconverted Man, knowing that he is such—I would not do it for a thousand Worlds—Lord Jesus keep thy own faithful Servants pure, and let them not be then Partakers of other Men's Sins.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="005311_0132_101819EA63D314E0"/>
Such an Instance as <HI>Saul'</HI>s Conversion was, we may be assured must make a great deal of Noise, and therefore no Wonder we are told, <HI>Ver.</HI> 21. <HI>But all that heard him were amazed, and said, Is not this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e that destroyed them which cal∣led on his Name in</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>and came hither for that Intent, that he might bring them bound to the Chief Priests?</HI></P>
<P>And thus it will be with all that appear pub∣lickly for Jesus Christ; and it's as impossible for a true Christian to be hid, as a City built upon a Hill—Brethren, if you are faithful to, you must be reproached, and have Remarks made on you for Christ; especially if you have been remarkably wicked before your Conver∣sion. What, (will your Friends say) is not this he, or she, who a little while ago would run to as great Excess of Riot and Vanity as the worst of us all? What has turned your Brain? Or if you have been close, false, formal Hypocrites as <HI>Saul</HI> was, they will wonder that <HI>you</HI> should be so deceived, as to think you were not in a safe State before—As, no doubt, Num∣bers were surprized to hear <HI>Saul,</HI> who was touching the Law blameless, affirm that he wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in a damnable Condition, (as in all Probability he did) a few Days ago.</P>
<P>Brethren, you must expect to meet with many such Difficulties as these—the Scourge of the Tongue is generally the first Cross we are called to bear for the Sake of Christ—Let not therefore this move you—It did not intimidate, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, it rather encouraged <HI>Saul.</HI></P>

<HI>But</HI> SAUL, says the Text, <HI>increased the more in Strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at</HI> Damascus, <HI>proving that this is very Christ.</HI>—Opposition never yet did, nor ever will hurt a sincere Convert—Nothing like Opposition to make the Man of God perfect—None but a Hireling, who careth not for the Sheep, will be affrighted at the Approach or Barking of Wolves—Christ's Ministers are as bold as Lions—It is not for such Men as they to flee.</P>
<P>And therefore (that I may draw towards a Conclusion) let the Ministers and Disciples of Christ, learn from <HI>Saul,</HI> not to fear Men or their Revilings, but, like him, increase in Strength, the more wicked Men endeavour to weaken their Hands.—We cannot be Christians without being opposed—No—Disciples in general must suffer—Ministers in particular must suffer great Things—But let not this move any of us from our Stedfastness in the Gospel—He that stood by and strengthned <HI>Saul,</HI> will also stand by and strengthen us. He is a God, mighty to save all that put their Trust in him—If we look up with an Eye of Faith, we, as well as the first Martyr St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> may see Jesus standing at the right Hand of God, ready to assist and pro∣tect us—Tho' the Lord's Seat is in Heaven, yet he has Respect to his Saints in an especial Man∣ner when suffering here on Earth—Then the Spirit of Christ and of Glory rests upon, their Souls.

of Men for the Sake of Jesus Christ.</Q> However little they may design it, my Enemies are my greatest Friends—What I most fear is a Calm; but the Enmity which is in the Hearts of natural Men against Christ, will not suffer them to be quiet long—No. As I hope the Work of God will increase, so the Rage of Men and Devils will increase also—Let us put on therefore the whole Armour of God—Oh! let us not fear the Face of Men—Let us fear him only, who can destroy both Body and Soul in Hell—I say unto you, let us fear him alone—You see how soon God can stop the Fury of his Enemies—You have just now heard of a proud, powerful Zealot stop'd in his full Career struck down to the Earth with a Light from Heaven, converted by the Almighty Power of efficacious Grace, and thereupon zealously promoting, nay resolutely suffering for the Faith which once with Threatnings &amp; Slaughters he endeavour'd to destroy—Let this teach us to pity and pray for our Lord's most inveterate Enemies—Who knows, but in Answer thereunto, our Lord may give them Repentance unto Life? Most think, that Christ had Respect to <HI>Stephen'</HI>s Prayer, when he converted <HI>Saul</HI>—Perhaps for this Rea∣son God suffers his Adversaries to go on, that his Goodness and Power may shine more bright in their Conversion—But let no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Persecu∣tors of Christ take Encouragement from this to continue in their Opposition—Remember, tho' <HI>Saul</HI> was converted, yet the High Priest and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Companions were left dead in Trespasses

was really abominable. <Q><HI>I give Tythes of all that I possess.</HI></Q> He might as well have said, <HI>I pay Tythes</HI>—But Self-righteous People (what∣ever they may say to the contrary) think they <HI>give</HI> something to God—<HI>I give Tythes of all that I possess</HI>—I make Conscience of giving Tythes, not only of all that the Law requires, but of my <HI>Mint, Annice,</HI> and <HI>Cummin,</HI> of all Things what∣soever that I possess—This was well. To pay Tythes when required by the Laws of the Land, is certainly our Duty—But to boast of such Things, or of Fasting, is <HI>Pharisaical</HI> &amp; Devilish. And now then let us sum up all the Righteous∣ness of this boasting <HI>Pharisee,</HI> and see what little Reason he had to <HI>trust in himself that he was righteou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> or to despise others. He is not <HI>Un∣just,</HI> (but we have only his ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Word for that, I think I have proved to the contrary.) He i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no <HI>Adulterer,</HI> no <HI>Extortioner,</HI> he fasts <HI>twice in the Week,</HI> and <HI>gives Tythes of all that he possesses.</HI>—And all this he might do, and a great deal more, and yet be a Child of the Devil. For here is no Mention made of his loving the Lord his God with all his Heart, which was the <HI>first and great Commandment of the Law.</HI>—Here's not a single Syllable of inward Religion—And he was not a true Jew, who was only one outwardly. And 'tis only an outside Piety at the best—In∣wardly he is full of Pride, Self-Justification, Free-will, and great Uncharitableness.</P>
<P>Were not the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> do you think, highly offended at this Character? For they might easily know it was spoken against them▪ And

tho' perhaps some of you may be offended at me, yet out of Love I must tell you, I fear this Para∣ble is spoken against many of you.—For are there not many of you, who go up to the Tem∣ple to pray, with no better Spirit than this <HI>Pha∣risee</HI> did? And because you fast, it may be in the <HI>Lent,</HI> or every <HI>Friday,</HI> and because you do No-body any Harm, receive the Sacrament, pay Tythes, give an Alms now and then, think that you are safe, and trust in yourselves that you are righteous, and inwardly despise those, who do not come up to you in these outward Duties? This I am persuaded is the Case of many of you, tho' alas! it is a desperate one, as I shall endeavour to shew at the Close of this Dis∣course.</P>

<P>The <HI>Publican standing afar off</HI>—Perhaps in the outward Court of the Temple, conscious to himself that he was not worthy to approach the Holy of Holies—So conscious, and so weighed down with a Sense of his own Unworthiness, that he would not so much as lift up his Eyes unto Heaven, which he knew was God's Throne—Poor Heart! what did he feel at this Time!

<P>This Man came up to the Temple to pray, and he prayed indeed—And a broken and contrite Heart God will not despise. <HI>I tell you,</HI> says our Lord—I who lay in the Bosom of the Father from all Eternity—I who am God, and there∣fore know all Things—I who can neither de∣ceive, nor be deceived, whose Judgment is ac∣cording to Right—<HI>I</HI> tell you, whatever <HI>you</HI> may

<P>Let <HI>Pharisees</HI> take Heed that they do not per∣vert this Text—For when it is said, <HI>this Man went down to his House justified rather than the other</HI>—Our Lord does not mean that both were justified, and that the <HI>Publican</HI> had rather more Justification than the <HI>Pharisee</HI>—But it implies, either that the <HI>Publican</HI> was actually justified, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <HI>Pharisee</HI> was not; or, that the <HI>Publican</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in a better Way for Justification, or in a better Frame to receive it, than the <HI>Pharisee</HI>—According to our Lord's Saying—<Q><HI>The Pub∣licans and Harlots enter into the Kingdom of Heaven before you</HI></Q>—That the <HI>Pharisee</HI> was not justified is certain—For God resisteth the Proud, and that the <HI>Publican</HI> was at this Time actually justified (and perhaps went home with a Sense of it in his Heart) we have great Reason to infer from the latter Part of the Text—<Q><HI>For every one that exalteth himself shall be abased, and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The Parable therefore now speaks to all that hear me this Day—For that our Lord intended it for our Learning is evident, from his making such a general Application—<HI>For every one,</HI> says he, <HI>that exalteth himself shall be abased, and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</HI></P>
<P>The Parable of the <HI>Publican</HI> and <HI>Pharisee</HI> is but as it were a Glass wherein we may see the

<P>And <HI>First,</HI> It convinces of Sin—And gene∣rally of some enormous Sin, the worst perhaps the convicted Person ever was guilty of—Thus when our Lord was conversing with the Woman of <HI>Samaria,</HI> he convinced her first of her Adul∣tery, <Q><HI>Woman,</HI> says he, <HI>Go call thy Husband—The Woman answered, and said, I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Husband—Jesus said unto her, Thou hast we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> said, I have no Husband: For thou hast had five Husbands, and he whom thou now hast, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not thy Husband: In this saidst thou truly.</HI></Q>—With this there went such a powerful Conviction of all her other actual Sins, that soon after she <HI>left her Water-pot, and went her Way into the City, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith to the Men, Come, and see a Man that told me all Things that ever I did: Is not this the Christ?</HI> Thus our Lord also dealt with the Persecutor <HI>Saul</HI>—He convinced him first of the horrid Sin of Persecution—<HI>Saul, Saul, Why persecutest thou N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>?</HI> Such a Sense of all his other Sins, in all Probability, at the same Time revived in his Mind, that immediately he died; that is▪ died to all his false Confidences, and was thrown into such an Agony of Soul, that he continued three

<P>And was it ever thus with you, my dear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earers? (For I must question you as I go along, because I intend, by the divine Help, to preach not only to your Heads, but your Hearts)—Did the Spirit of God ever bring all your Sins thus▪ to Remembrance, &amp; make you cry out to God, <HI>Thou writest bitter Things against me?</HI> Did your actual Sins ever appear before you, as tho' drawn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Map? If not, you have great Reason (un∣less you were sanctified from the Womb) to sus∣pect that you are not convicted, much more not converted, and that the Promise of the Text was never yet fulfilled in your Hearts.</P>
<P>Further: When the Comforter comes into a Sinner's Heart, tho' it generally convinces the Sinner of his <HI>actual</HI> Sin first, yet it leads him to see and bewail his <HI>original</HI> Sin, the Fountain from which all these polluted Streams flow.</P>
<P>Tho' every Thing in Earth, Air, and Water, every Thing both without and within, concur to prove the Truth of that Assertion in the Scripture, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>in Adam we all have died;</HI> not most are so harden'd, thro' the Deceitfulness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sin, that notwithstanding they may give an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sent to the Truth of that Proposition in their

<P>And did the Comforter, my dear Friends, ever come with such a convincing Power as this into your Hearts? Were you ever made to see and feel, that in your Flesh dwelleth no good Thing▪—That you are conceived &amp; born in Sin—That you are by Nature Children of Wrath—That God would be just if he damned you, tho' you never committed an actual Sin in your Lives? So often as you have been at Church and Sacra∣ment, did you ever feelingly confess, that there was no Health in you—That the Remembrance of your original and actual Sins was <HI>grievous</HI> unto you, and the Burthen of them <HI>intolerable?</HI> If not, you have been only offering God vai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Ob∣lations—You never yet prayed in your Lives—The Comfort never yet came effectually into your Souls—Consequently you are not in the

<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Comforter, when he comes effectually to work upon a Sinner, not only con∣vinces him of the Sin of his Nature, the Sin of his Life, but also the Sin of his <HI>Duties.</HI></P>
<P>We all naturally are Legalists, thinking to be justified by the Works of the Law—When somewhat awakened by the Terrors of the Lord, we immediately, like the <HI>Pharisees</HI> of old, go <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bout to establish our own Righteousness, and think we shall find Acceptance with God, if we seek it with Tears—Finding ourselves dam∣ned by Nature, and our actual Sins, we the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> think to recommend ourselves to God by our Duties, and hope by our Doings of one Kind or another, to inherit eternal Life—But whenever the Comforter comes into the Heart, it con∣vinces the Soul of these false Rests, and makes the Sinner, to see that all his Righteousnesses are but as filthy Rags—And that his best Works are but so many splendid Sins—And that for the most pompous Services, he deserves no bet∣ter a Doom than that of the unprofitable Ser∣vant, <HI>viz.</HI> to be thrown into outer Darkness, where is weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of Teeth.</P>

<P>None of us believe by Nature—But after the Holy Ghost has convinced us of the Sin of our Natures, and the Sin of our Lives, and Duties, in order to convince us of our utter Inability to save ourselves, and that we must be beholden to God, as for every thing else, so for Faith (with∣out which, it is impossible to please, or be saved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Christ.) He convinces us also, that we have no Faith—Dost thou believe on the Son of God? is the grand Question which the Holy Ghost now puts to the Soul—At the same Time he works with such Power and Demonstration, that the Soul sees, and is obliged to confess that it has no Faith.</P>
<P>This is a Thing little thought of by most that call themselves Believers—They dream they are Christians, because they live in a Christian Country—If they were born <HI>Turks,</HI> they would believe on <HI>Mahomet</HI>—For what is that which Men commonly call Faith, but an outward Con∣sent to the establish'd Religion?

imagine) as to get a Catalogue of Sins, which you look over, and confess in a formal Manner, as often as you go to the Holy Sacrament—But amongst all your Sins, did you ever once con∣fess and bewail that damning Sin of <HI>Unbelief?</HI>—Were you ever made to cry out, <Q>Lord, give me Faith—Lord, give me to believe on thee, Oh, that I had Faith▪—Oh, that I could believe!</Q> If you never were thus distressed—At least, if you never saw and felt, that you had no Faith, it is a certain Sign that the Holy Ghost the Comforter, never came into, and worked, savingly upon your Souls.</P>
<P>But is it not odd, that the Holy Ghost should, be called a Comforter, when it is plain, by they Experience of all God's Children, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of Conviction is usually attended with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Conflicts, and a great deal of Soul▪<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>?—I answer, the Holy Ghost may well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> termed a Comforter, even in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Work—Be∣cause it is the only Way to, and ends in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Comfort—Blessed are they that are th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> convicted by him, for they shall be comforted Nay, not only so, but there is present Comfort▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the midst of these Convictions—The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> rejoice in the Sight of its own Misery—Blesses God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bringing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Darkness into Light, and looks forward with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Comfortable Prospect of fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re Deliverance<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> knowing, that tho' Sorrow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay endure for a Night, Joy will come in the Morning.</P>
<P>Thus it is that the Holy Ghost convinces the Soul of Sin—And if so, holy wretchedly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>—

<P>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Conscience will accuse or con∣vince us of any common Sin—But the Light of natural Conscience never did, never will, and never can convince of Unbelief—If it could, how comes it to pass, that not one of the Hea∣thens, who improved the Light of Nature in such an eminent Degree, was ever convinced of Unbelief?

Justice which we ought to practise between Man and Man—As when <HI>Paul</HI> is said to reason of <HI>Temperance</HI> and <HI>Righteousness</HI> before a trembling <HI>Felix</HI>—But here (as in a Multitude of other Places in holy Writ) we are to understand by the Word <HI>Righteousness,</HI> the active and passive Obedience of the dear Lord Jesus—Even that perfect, personal, all-sufficient Righteousness, which he has wrought out for that World which the Spirit is to convince—<HI>Of Righteousness,</HI> says our Lord, <HI>because I go to the Father, and ye see me no more</HI>—This is one Argument that the Holy Spirit makes use of to prove Christ's Righteousness—Because he is gone to the Father, and we see him no more—For, had he not wrought out a sufficient Righteousness, the Father would have sent him back, as not having done what he un∣dertook, and we should have seen him again.</P>
<P>Oh, the Righteousness of Christ! It so com∣forts my Soul, that I must be excused if I men∣tion it in all my Discourses—I would not, if I could help it, have one Sermon without it—Whatever Infidels may object, or <HI>Arminians</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ophistically argue against an <HI>imputed Righteous∣ness</HI>—Yet whoever know themselves and God, must acknowledge, that Jesus Christ is the End of the Law for Righteousness, and perfect Justi∣fication, in the Sight of God, to every one that believeth.

see no other Foundation whereon to build my Hopes of Salvation, but on the Rock of Christ's personal Righteousness imputed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Soul.</P>
<P>Many I believe have a rational Conviction of, and agree with me in this—But rational Con∣victions, if rested in, avail but little—It must be a spiritual, experimental Conviction of the Truth which is saving—And therefore our Lord says—When the Holy Ghost comes, in the Day of his Power, it convinces of this Righteousness, <HI>viz.</HI> of the Reality, and Compleatness, &amp; Sufficiency of it, to save a poor Sinner.</P>
<P>In the foregoing Part of this Discourse, we shewed how the Holy Ghost convinces the Sin∣ner of the Sin of his Nature, Life, Duties, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Sin of Unbelief—And what then must the poor Creature do? He must, he must inevi∣tably despair, if there be no Hope but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n him∣self—When therefore the Spirit has haunted the Sinner out of all his false Rests &amp; Hiding-Places, taken off the pitiful Fig-leaves of his own Work<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and driven him out of the Trees of the Garden (his outward Reformations) and placed him naked before the Bar of a sovereign, holy, just, and Sin-avenging God; then, then it is, when the Soul, having the Sentence of Death within itself because of Unbelief, has a sweet Display <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christ's Righteousness made to it by the Holy Spirit of God—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is that he begins <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> We <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to act in the Quality of a Comforter, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Soul so powerfully of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> All-sufficiency of Christ's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></P>

<P>None, none can tell, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> those happy Souls who have experienced it▪ with what Demon∣stration of the Spirit this Conviction comes—Oh, how amiable, as well as all-sufficient, does the blessed Jesus now appear!

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SAlvation every where through the whole Scripture, is said to be the Free Gift of God thro' Jesus Christ our Lord. Not only Free, because God is a sovereign Agent, and therefore may withold it from, or confer it on whom he pleaseth; but Free, be∣cause there is nothing to be found in Man, that can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Way induce God to be merciful unto him. The Righteousness o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Jesus Christ is the sole Cause of our finding Favour in God's Sight—Thus Righteousness apprehended by Faith (which
<PB N="199" REF="005311_0206_10181B3C8AA5CCB0"/>
is also the Gift of God) makes it our own—And this Faith, if true, will work by Love.</P>
<P>These are Parts of those Glad Tidings which are publish'd in the Gospel, and of the Certainty of them, next to the express Word of God, the Experience of all such as have been saved, is the best, and, as I take it, the most undoubted Proof—That God might teach us every Way, he has been pleased to leave upon Record many Instances of the Power of his Grace exerted in the Salvation of several particular Persons, that we, hearing how he dealt with them, might from thence infer the Manner we must expect to be dealt with ourselves, and learn in what Way we must look for Salvation, if we truly desire to be made Partakers of the heavenly Inheritance with the Saints in Light.</P>
<P>The Conversion of the Person referred to in the Text, I think will be of no small Service to us in this Matter, if rightly improved—I would hope most of you know who the Person is, to whom the Lord Jesus speaks—It is the Publican <HI>Zaccheus,</HI> to whose House the blessed Jesus said Salvation came, and whom he pronounces a Son of <HI>Abraham.</HI></P>
<P>It is my Design (God helping) to make some Remarks upon his Conversion recorded at large in the Verses foregoing, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n to infor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the latter Part of the Text, as an Encouragement to poor, undone Sinners to come to Jesus Christ—<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which was lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="005311_0207_10181B3E5C830AB0"/>
St. <HI>Luke</HI> introduces the Account of this Man's Conversion thus—<HI>Ver.</HI> 1. <Q><HI>And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho</HI></Q>—The Holy Jesus made it his Business to go about doing Good—As the Sun in the Firmament is continually spreading his benign, quickning, and chearing Influences over the natural, so the Son of Righ∣teousness arose with healing under his Wings, and was daily and hourly diffusing his gracious Influences over the moral World—The Chapter foregoing, acquaints us of a notable Miracle wrought by the Holy Jesus on a poor blind <HI>Bar∣timeus</HI>—And in this a greater presents itself to our Consideration—The Evangelist would have us take particular Notice of it—For he intro∣duces it with the Word <HI>Behold</HI>—<Q><HI>And behold,</HI> says he, <HI>Ver.</HI> 2 <HI>there was a Man named Zac∣cheus, which was the Chief among the Publicans, and he was rich.</HI></Q></P>

<P>There's no seeing Christ in Glory, unless we run before the Multitude, and are willing to be in the Number of those despised few, who take the Kingdom of God by Violence—That broad Way, in which so many go, can never be that strait and narrow Way which leads to Life—Our Lord's Flock was, and always will be, comparatively a little One—And unless we dare to run before the Multitude in a holy Sin∣gularity, and can rejoyce in being accounted Fools for Christ's Sake, we shall never see Jesus with Comfort, when he appears in Glory—From mentioning the Sycamore-Tree, and considering the Difficulty with which <HI>Zaccheus</HI> must climb it, we may further learn, that those who would see Christ, must undergo other Difficulties and Hardships besides Contempt. <HI>Zaccheus,</HI> without doubt, went through both—Did not many, think you, laugh at him as he ran along, and in the Language of <HI>Michal, Saul'</HI>s Daughter, cry out, How glorious did the rich <HI>Zaccheus</HI> look to Day, when forgetting the Greatness of his Station, he ran before a pitiful, giddy Mob, and climbed up a Sycamore-Tree, to see an <HI>Enthusiastick</HI> Preacher!—But <HI>Zaccheus</HI> cares not for all that—His Curiosity was strong—If he could but see who Jesus was, he did not value what Scoffers said of him—And thus much more will it be

with all those who have an effectual Desire to see Jesus in Heaven—They will go on from Strength to Strength, break through every Diffi∣culty lying in their Way, and care not what Men or Devils say of, or do unto them—<HI>May the Lord make us all thus minded for his dear Son's Sake!</HI></P>
<P>At length, after taking much Pains, and going (as we may well suppose) thro' much Contempt, <HI>Zaccheus</HI> has climbed the Tree; and there he sits, as he thinks, hid in the Leaves of it, and watching when he should see Jesus pass by—<HI>"For he was to pass by that Way."</HI></P>
<P>But sing, O Heavens, and rejoyce, O Earth!

Well might St. <HI>Luke</HI> usher in the Account with the Word <HI>Behold!</HI> It is worthy our highest Admiration. When <HI>Zaccheus</HI> thought of no such Thing, nay, thought that Christ Jesus did not know him, <HI>Behold</HI> Christ does, what we never hear he did before or after, I mean, invite himself to the House of <HI>Zaccheus</HI>—Saying, <HI>Zac∣cheus, make haste add come down; for this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I must abide at thy House</HI>—Not <HI>pray let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>,</HI>

He was one of those whom the Father had given him from all Eternity. Therefore he must abide at his House that Day—<HI>For whom he did pre∣destinate, them he also called.</HI></P>
<P>Here then, as through a Glass, we may see the Doctrine of <HI>free Grace</HI> evidently exemplified before us—Here was no Fitness in <HI>Zaccheus</HI>—He was a <HI>Publican,</HI> chief among the <HI>Publicans,</HI> not only so, but rich, and came hither to see Christ only out of <HI>Curiosity.</HI> But sovereign Grace triumphs over all—And if we do God Justice, and are effectually wrought upon, we must acknowledge there was no more Fitness in us, than in <HI>Zaccheus</HI>—And had not Christ pre∣vented us by his Call, we had remained dead in Trespasses and Sins, and alienated from the divine Life, even as others.<Q><HI>Jesus looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zaccheus, make haste and come down; for this Day I must abide at thy House.</HI></Q></P>
<P>With what different Emotions of Heart may we suppose <HI>Zaccheus</HI> received this Invitation? Think you not that he was surprized to hear Jesus Christ call him by Name, and not only so, but invite himself to his House? Surely thinks <HI>Zaccheus,</HI> I dream. It cannot be—How should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e know me? I never saw him before—Besides, I shall undergo much Contempt, if I receive him under my Roof—Thus, I say, we may suppose

<P>Thus it is the great God brings home his Children.

He was made Partaker of like precious Faith with <HI>Abraham</HI>—Like <HI>Abraham</HI> he believed on the Lord, and it was accounted to him for Righteousness—His Faith, like <HI>Abraham'</HI>s, worked by Love, and I doubt not, but he has been long since sitting in <HI>Abra∣ham'</HI>s Harbour.</P>
<P>And now are you not ashamed of yourselves, who speak against the Doctrines of Grace, espe∣cially that Doctrine of being justified by Faith alone, as tho' it leaded to Licentiousness? What can be more unjust than such a Charge? Is not the Instance of <HI>Zaccheus</HI> a sufficient Proof to the contrary? Have I strained it to serve my own Turn? God forbid—To the best of my Knowledge I have spoken the Truth in Sincerity and the Truth as it is in Jesus—I do affirm that we are saved <HI>by Grace,</HI> and that we are justified
<PB N="213" REF="005311_0220_10181B6091528A30"/>
<HI>by Faith alone</HI>—But I do also affirm, that Faith must be evidenced by Good Works, where there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an Opportunity of performing them.</P>
<P>What therefore has been said of <HI>Zaccheus,</HI> may serve as a Rule, whereby all may judge whether they have Faith or not—You say you have Faith—But how do you prove it? Did you ever hear the Lord Jesus call you by Name? Were you ever made to obey that Call? Did you ever, like <HI>Zaccheus,</HI> receive Jesus Christ joyfully into your Hearts? Are you influenced by the Faith you say you have, to stand up and contess the Lord Jesus before Men? Were you ever made willing to own, and humble your selves for your past Offences? Does your Faith work by Love, so that you conscientiously lay up, according as God as prospered you, for the Support of the Poor? Do you give Alms of all Things that you possess? And have you made due Restitution to those you have wronged? If so, happy are ye—Salvation is come to your Souls—You are Sons, you are Daughters of, you shall shortly be everlastingly blessed with, faithful <HI>Abraham.</HI> But if you are not thus minded, do not deceive your own Souls—Tho' you may talk of Justification by Faith like Angels, it will do you no Good—It will only increase your Damnation—You hold the Truth, but it is in Unrighteousness. Your Faith, being without Works, is dead—You have the <HI>Devil,</HI> not <HI>Abraham,</HI> for your Father—Unless you get a Faith of the Heart, a Faith working by Love, with Devils and damned Spirits shall you dwell for evermore.</P>

But it is Time now to enforce the latter Part of the Text—<HI>"For the Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which was lost"</HI>—These Words are spoken by our Saviour in Answer to some self-righteous <HI>Pharisees,</HI> who, instead of rejoycing with the Angels in Heaven at the Con∣version of such a Sinner, murmured, saying, <HI>that he was gone to be a Guest with a Man that was a Sinner</HI>—To vindicate his Conduct, he tells them, that this was an Act agreeable to the Design of his Coming—<HI>For the Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which was lost</HI>—He might have said the <HI>Son of God</HI>—But Oh the wonderful Condescension of our Redeemer! He delights to stile himself the <HI>Son of Man</HI>—He came, says he, not only to save, <HI>but to seek and to save that which was lost</HI>—He came to <HI>Jericho</HI> to seek and save <HI>Zaccheus.</HI> For other∣wise <HI>Zaccheus</HI> would never have been saved by him—But from whence came he? Even from Heaven, his Dwelling-Place, to this lower Earth, this Vale of Tears, <HI>to seek and save that which was lost</HI>—All that feel themselves lost, and are willing, like <HI>Zaccheus,</HI> to receive him into their Hearts—To save them—With how great a Salvation! Even from the Guilt, and also Power of their Sins—To make them Heirs of God, and Joint-Heirs with himself, and Partakers of that Glory, which he enjoyed with the Father before the World began—Thus will the <HI>Son of Man</HI> save that which is lost—He was made the <HI>Son of Man</HI> on purpose that he might save them—He had no other End but this in leaving his Father's

Shall I go home rejoycing? Saying, that many like Sheep have went astray, but they have now be∣lieved on Jesus Christ, and so returned home to the great Shepherd and Bishop of their Souls.
