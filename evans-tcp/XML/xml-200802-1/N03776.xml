<HEAD>Mr. <HI>WHITEFIELD</HI>'s JOURNAL FROM London <HI>to</HI> Gibraltar.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ACcording to your Request, I have herewith sent you an Account of what GOD has done for my Soul since I left <HI>England.</HI>— The sole Motive (if my Heart doth not deceive me) which induced me to leave my native Country was a full Conviction that it was the Divine Will I should. What Reasons I can urge for this Persuasion, is need∣less to mention, because few in this Case would judge impartially, and what seems a Reason to me, may not be deemed so by another. Let it suffice to in∣form you, that after earnest Prayer for a Year and a half, that if the Design was not of GOD, it might come to nought, tho' strongly sollicited to act in a contrary Manner, I found myself as eagerly bent on going abroad as ever.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="004631_0003_100DB1BFD0CAFB10"/>Accordingly, <HI>Wednesday December</HI> 28, 1737, after having continued instant in Prayer with my Friends at Mr. <HI>J. H</HI>'s, and afterwards receiving the Holy Sacrament at St. <HI>Dunstan</HI>'s, being recommend∣ed to the Grace of GOD by a great Number of weep∣ing Christian Brethren at the Rev. Mr. <HI>H</HI>'s, I set out at Night for <HI>Deptford</HI> in a Coach, accompanied by four Friends, and got there at Ten. Here a Widow Woman gladly received us in her House; and many of my Friends gave me the meeting, who came on Foot from <HI>London,</HI> with intent to accom∣pany me to the Ship; and with them I took a little bodily Refreshment; spent two or three Hours in particular Intercession for our Friends and Enemies, and all Mankind; sung Psalms and Hymns and spi∣ritual Songs, and then betook ourselves to Rest, and <HI>the LORD made us to dwell in Safety.</HI> [<HI>Oh who can express the unspeakable Joy of religious Friends?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday, Dec.</HI> 29. Rose early in the Morning, and continued instant in Intercession, chanting and singing of Psalms with my Friends till Nine, at which our Hearts were much rejoiced. After this we went in quest of our Ship, but finding she was fallen down to <HI>Purfleet,</HI> and was not to remove to <HI>Gravesend</HI> for some Time, we returned to <HI>Deptford</HI> praising GOD, and praying for a Blessing on our in∣tended Voyage. <HI>The LORD perform all our Pe∣titiion</HI>!</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> returned to <HI>Deptford</HI> with my friends, we dined comfortably together, joined in a Psalm, read
<PB N="5" REF="004631_0003_100DB1BFD0CAFB10"/>
the Lessons for the Day, and concluded with Prayer. Some were then obliged to depart for <HI>London.</HI> After they were gone, I continued with the rest in parti∣cular Intercession for near two Hours, and then GOD was pleased to comfort my Heart. <HI>If parting from a few earthly Friends for a Season be so grievous, How will the Wicked bear to be parted from GOD and good Men for all Eternity.</HI></P>
<P>It happened providentially that a Lecture was to be preached that Evening at <HI>Deptford,</HI> and several importuned me to preach it. At first I was fearful (O me of little Faith) having no Notes: But after∣wards (having got the Consent of the Minister) I went up, depending on the Promise, <HI>Lo I am with you always even unto the End of the World</HI>; and was enabled to preach to a large Congregation without the least Hesitation. <HI>Did any one yet ever trust in the LORD and was forsaken?</HI> What gave me a great Comfort, and made me more thankful, was, that the Opportunity, I believe, was granted, in answer to Prayer.</P>
<P><HI>Friday, Dec.</HI> 30. Went with our Baggage and nine or ten Friends in a <HI>Gravesend</HI> Boat to <HI>Purfleet,</HI> where the <HI>Whitaker</HI> was fallen down. Spent the Time we were on the Water in singing Psalms and particular Intercession; and came on board about Ten in the Morning.</P>
<P>I spoke some few Things to my new Charge, spent the Remainder of the Day on Shore with my Friends, in singing Psalms, Prayer, and exhorting
<PB N="6" REF="004631_0004_100DB1C16ECB2428"/>
one another to Love and good Works: Returned at Night to our Ship, and lay with my Friend <HI>H.</HI> upon the Ground in a Matress, in the great Cabbin: And GOD was pleased to give me a Proof that he was with me in the Ship.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Dec.</HI> 31. Began this Morning to have publick Prayers on open Deck, at which the Officer and Soldiers attended with Decency and Reverence. After Prayer I enlarged a little on those Words of St. <HI>Paul, I am determined to know nothing among you save JESUS CHRIST and him crucified,</HI> told them how my future Conduct would be; made some Pro∣fessions of my hearty Love and sincere Affection for their Souls; and then dismissed them, I believe somewhat moved. <HI>Oh, that I may have Grace to act suitably to this Profession!</HI></P>
<P>To-day also I began to visit the Sick, and took that Opportunity of discoursing on the Uncertainty of Life, and the Certainty of a future Judgment, to those around me; and GOD was pleased not to let my Words fall to the Ground.</P>
<P>About Twelve, I went and paid my Friends a Visit, who were on Shore, and spent two or three delightful Hours in praising and blessing GOD.</P>
<P>Soon came another Friend with two honest Men from <HI>Gravesend,</HI> desiring me in the Name of the Minister to come and preach to them the following Lord's Day: At first I was unwilling to leave my own Flock in the Ship, but my Friends Reasonings overbalanced mine, and I went on board, read pub∣lick
<PB N="7" REF="004631_0004_100DB1C16ECB2428"/>
Prayers, visited the Sick, gave the Soldiers an Exhortation, (at which the Solders were surprisingly affected); and then took Boat with them for <HI>Graves∣end.</HI> My Heart was much enlarged in Intercession. The Evening was exceeding calm, the Sky clear, and all Things conspired to praise that glorious and lofty One that inhabits Eternity, who <HI>stretcheth forth the Heavens like a Curtain, and holdeth the Waters in the Hollow of his Hand.</HI></P>
<P>About Seven at Night, GOD brought us safe to <HI>Gravesend,</HI> where Mr. <HI>H.</HI> received both me and my Friends most courteously, and loaded us with many Benefits: <HI>The good LORD have Mercy on him in that Day.</HI></P>
<P>We spent the Evening very agreeably in Prayer, and Singing, and then betook ourselves to Sleep, having before exhorted one another to prepare our Spices and Ointments of Praise and Thanksgiving, and to rest on the approaching Sabbath according to the Commandment.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, January</HI> 1. Blessed be GOD for the hap∣py Beginning of a new Year! for it has been a Day of fat Things: We rose in the Morning, and retired to an adjacent. Hill with my Friends to Prayer; and afterwards were most agreeably surprised with the Coming of several more <HI>London</HI> Friends (whom I love as my own Soul), who came all Night on the Water to see me.</P>
<P>About Ten we went to Church, where I preach'd; and the Curate was so kind, at our Request, as to give us the Sacrament.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="004631_0005_100DB1C4AB9107C8"/>In the Afternoon I preached again to a more nu∣merous Congregation than in the Morning: And being to stay there but one Lord's Day, I was pres∣sed to preach and read Prayers a third Time, at Six in the Evening. It was a Thing I found entirely new; but upon the Curate's readily complying to lend the Pulpit, and my Friends and the People's Importunity, I looked upon it as a Call of Provi∣dence, and accordingly read Prayers and preached to a very thronged Auditory; and this I did with∣out Notes, having brought but two written Sermons with me. <HI>Oh! who can express the loving Kindness of the LORD, or shew forth all his Praise?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, Jan.</HI> 2. 1737. 8. Sat up 'till Twelve at Night, to take leave of some of my Friends, whose Business obliged them to be at <HI>London</HI> the next Morn∣ing; and then, after three or four Hours Rest, rose and walked to <HI>Greenhith</HI> with the Remainder of my Friends, intending to take a Boat there, and so re∣turn to my Charge at <HI>Purfleet.</HI> But just as we were entring the Boat, providentially came a Boy, telling us, the <HI>Whitaker</HI> was falling down to <HI>Gravesend,</HI> and ready to sail, if not actually under Sail; we imme∣diately hasted back from whence we came, and went on our Way rejoicing.</P>
<P>About Eleven we reached <HI>Gravesend,</HI> and happily found the Ship was not to sail till the morrow. This put Gladness into my Heart, as it gave me an Op∣portunity of settling some Affairs of Consequence, and conversing a little longer with my dear Friends.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="004631_0005_100DB1C4AB9107C8"/>About Twelve o'Clock I went on board, leaving my Friends to dine on Shore: And as I went along, GOD was pleased to shew me he had given a Bles∣sing to my Discourses; the People seemed greatly alarmed, and wished me heartily a good Voyage, and the very Sailors were surprisingly affectionate. <HI>Blessed be GOD for setting his Seal to my unworthy Ministry!</HI> Spent the Remainder of the Day in set∣tling Things on board, visiting the Sick, teaching the Children, and reading Prayers, and Preaching. <HI>All Love, all Glory be to GOD through CHRIST!</HI></P>
<P>In the Evening I went on Shore again to my Friends, pray'd, sung Psalms, and expounded (I think) a Chapter out of the holy Scriptures to them, and was not a little comforted. <HI>Praise the LORD, O my Soul!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, Jan.</HI> 3. Went on board, read Prayers and Preached, visited the Sick, and then took a final Leave, as I thought, of my Friends. Spent the Af∣ternoon in writing Letters, and putting Things in Order. And (what I esteemed a great Blessing) tho' I had been used to so large a Sphere of Action, yet my Change of Life gave me not the least Uneasi∣ness, but my Heart was refreshed with Joy unspeak∣able, and full of Glory.</P>
<P>This Evening began to read Prayers between Decks, judging it would be too cold above.</P>
<P>At Night I went, according to Custom, on Shore to <HI>Gravesend,</HI> where I was agreeably surprised by seeing my Friends. I took leave of them in the
<PB N="10" REF="004631_0006_100DB1C6C55D7190"/>
Morning once more, the Weather preventing their going to <HI>London.</HI> Here also Mr. <HI>C. W.</HI> and Mr. <HI>W. H.</HI> gave me the meeting, with whom we pray'd, sung Psalms, commended one another to GOD, and parted the next Morning like Christian Brethren.</P>
<P> <HI>Wednesday, Jan.</HI> 4. Came on board at Ten in the Morning; but could not have publick Prayers, be∣cause the Soldiers were engaged with their Officer: But I visited the Sick, and perceived the Soldiers were attentive to hear me, when I applied myself to those around the sick Persons. I also distributed amongst the Sick of my <HI>London</HI> Friends kind Pre∣sents, to convince them I had a Love for, and to gain an Access to their Souls. I visited the Sick, read Prayers, and preached <HI>extempore</HI> (as I constantly do Morning and Evening) and went with Mr. <HI>H.</HI> in the Evening on Shore to <HI>Gravesend,</HI> where we in∣terceded for Friends, expounded a Chapter, and went to Bed, with <HI>that Peace of Mind which passeth all Understanding. Oh that the sensual, careless, half Christian could but know the Comforts of Religion!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday, Jan.</HI> 5. This Day GOD was with me of a Truth: I was refreshed in Spirit, by hearing from some <HI>London</HI> Friends, and receiving some kind Presents from Persons I could never have thought of; was assisted much in writing Letters; came on board, read Prayers, and preached; visited the Sick, and had GOD with me all Day long: Begun to cate∣chise six or seven of the young Soldiers on open Deck. I was surprised they would submit to it▪
<PB N="11" REF="004631_0006_100DB1C6C55D7190"/>
but GOD has the Hearts of all Men in his Hands.</P>
<P>Great Civility was shewn me on board by the Officers; and Capt. <HI>W.</HI> sent his Boat to fetch me to <HI>Gravesend,</HI> whither I went; having visited the Sick, read Prayers, and preached on Deck.</P>
<P>When on Shore, I wrote several Letters, ex∣pounded a Chapter to a Room full of People. Ca∣techised the Children of the House, and three of my own Companions, and then went to Bed, full of <HI>Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghost.</HI></P>
<P>My Health of Body, I could perceive, increased, and my Soul was much refreshed. I now began once more to feel the Comforts of a retired Life, and blessed GOD from my Heart, that he had called me whither I was going.</P>
<P><HI>Friday, Jan.</HI> 6. About Nine I came on board, read Prayers, and preached between Decks; and Mr. <HI>H.</HI> sung a Psalm, as he generally does. In the mean while, the Ship loosed from <HI>Gravesend,</HI> and sailed by Twelve o'Clock to the <HI>Nore.</HI> We had a very brisk Gale of Wind.</P>
<P>GOD gave me great Comfort, and I went between Decks, and sate down on the Ground, and read <HI>Arndt</HI>'s <HI>True Christianity</HI>: And part of the Time I stood upon Deck, and admired the Wonders of GOD in the Deep.</P>
<P>Three or four were added to-day to my Cate∣chumens, some of whom I had great Hopes of Read Prayers, preached upon Deck near the Stern, (having no Place for Retirement;) talked to the
<PB N="12" REF="004631_0007_100DB1C89FD811B0"/>
Sailors on the Fore-Castle; wrote my Journal; and climb'd up into my Cabbin to Bed, where my Friend <HI>H.</HI> and I say as comfortably as on a Bed of State.</P>
<P>Some of the Passengers, amongst whom was Mr. <HI>H.</HI> began now to be sick: But I felt very little of it; on the contrary GOD enabled me to rejoice with ex∣ceeding great Joy; my Heart was warmed by talk∣ing to the Sailors, and I was so lifted even above myself, that I could have <HI>watched unto Prayer</HI> and Praise all Night.</P>
<P>I found that above an Hundred, exclusive of the Ship's Company, were on board; <HI>GOD grant that not one of them may perish through my Neglect.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Jan.</HI> 7. Breakfasted with some of the Gentlemen in the Great Cabbin, who were very civil, and let me put in a Word for GOD.</P>
<P>Read publick Prayers, and began to expound the <HI>Lord</HI>'s <HI>Prayer</HI> to the Soldiers, by way of Ser∣mon, and GOD enabled me to do it with Power. After that I instructed my Catechumens, who now amounted to twelve or thirteen. <HI>GOD made them Soldiers of</HI> CHRIST <HI>as well as of the King.</HI></P>
<P>Had an Hour's Conversation with a Gentleman on board, on our Fall in <HI>Adam,</HI> and the Necessity of our New Birth in CHRIST JESUS, and hope it was not unpleasant to him.</P>
<P>To-day obtained what I prayed for, <HI>viz.</HI> a Place to retire into: For Captain <HI>W.</HI> on my bare menti∣oning my Want of such a thing, offered me the free Use of his own Cabbin, a Place very commodious for that Purpose.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="004631_0007_100DB1C89FD811B0"/>Catechised those who went with me on open Deck, for Example to others, and found they improved. Captain <HI>W.</HI> the two Cadets, and Serieants, sat very serious and attentive. But when the Captain of the Soldiers came, my Heart sunk a little (tho' without any Reason;) however I did not leave off. <HI>O Cor∣ruption thou art my Sister!</HI></P>
<P>Read publick Prayers, and finished my Exposi∣tion of the <HI>Lord's Prayer</HI> to the Soldiers, at which they attended very orderly. At Night I and my five Companions went upon Deck, and interceded and sung Psalms, by which my Heart was much en∣larged. The Weather was very cold, and the Wind magnified that GOD, <HI>at whose Word the stormy Wind ariseth.</HI></P>
<P>Now I fulfilled my Promise to the LORD'S Peo∣ple and while the Winds and Storms were blowing over me, I made earnest Supplications to GOD for them.</P>
<P>The Ship continued at the <HI>Nore</HI> all this Day; but I hope we made some Advances towards Eternity.</P>
<P>In the Evening the Wind blew very fresh indeed; and had our Ship been in the <HI>Downs,</HI> we should have been in great Danger. <HI>How wisely doth GOD provide for us!</HI> Most People began now to be Sea∣sick, particularly <HI>J.D.</HI> one of my Companions was grievously afflicted.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, Jan.</HI> 8. My Friend <HI>H.</HI> and I have great Reason to be thankful to GOD; for we slept as well as we could desire, though the Wind blew very hard,
<PB N="14" REF="004631_0008_100DB1CAB4D62B38"/>
 and the Sailors were very busy in taking care of the Ship, which by the Morning had dragged her An∣chor two Miles.</P>
<P>Went early and visited the Sea-sick Soldiers and their Families between Decks, gave them some Sage-Tea and Sugar, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and excited them all to Thank∣fulness and Repentance, out of Gratitude for their Preservation from the last Night's Storm; and re∣turned publick Thanks at Morning Prayers.</P>
<P>Thought much of my dear <HI>London</HI> Friends; tho' absent in Body, was present in Spirit in sacred Or∣dinances; and interceded for them and all Mankind most servently. Read publick Prayers and preached twice to the Soldiers: and read Prayers once in the Great Cabbin to the Officers, at their Request, which I liked very well: Catechised my own Companions, but had not Time to catechise the Soldiers, on ac∣count of attending the Sick.</P>
<P>To-day being the first LORD's Day I have spent this long time in so private a manner, I could not avoid reflecting on the following Lines:</P>
<LG>
<L>I sigh whene'er my musing Thoughts</L>
<L>Those happy Days present,</L>
<L>When I with Troops of pious Friends</L>
<L>Thy Temple did frequent;</L>
<L>When I advanc'd with Songs of Praise,</L>
<L>My solemn Vows to pay,</L>
<L>And led the joyful sacred Throng</L>
<L>That kept the Festal Day.</L>
</LG>
<P><PB N="15" REF="004631_0008_100DB1CAB4D62B38"/>
But I considered it was the Divine Will that placed me here, and therefore I rejoiced. <HI>He is unworthy the Name of a Christian, who is not as willing to hide himself when GOD commands, as to act in a publick Capacity.</HI></P>
<P>Began now to live a little by Rule, and to exa∣mine into the Interiors of those that came with me; which I found a most useful Exercise both for them and me. Continued all this Day at the <HI>Nore,</HI> being quite becalmed; and at Night had a most comforta∣ble Intercession for all Friends, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, Jan.</HI> 9. Mr. <HI>H.</HI> began to learn <HI>Latin.</HI> Had near twenty Catechumens with my own Com∣panions, who I believe made some Advances.</P>
<P>Weighed from the <HI>Nore,</HI> and sailed before the Wind in Company with several others, which car∣ried us on so briskly, that we anchor'd before <HI>Mar∣gate</HI> about One. Here I enjoyed a wished for Op∣portunity of writing to some of my <HI>London</HI> Friends, and found my Heart greatly enlarged towards them.</P>
<P>After Dinner having some Necessaries to buy, Mr. <HI>H.</HI> and I went on Shore to <HI>Margate.</HI> The Wind blew very fresh, and <HI>the Sea raged horribly, but He that dwelleth on high was mightier,</HI> and kept us from the least Fright, and filled me with great Joy, and brought us safe on Shore. We had the most abandoned Man with us I ever saw, who came out of an <HI>East-India</HI> Ship: He had so much of the Devil in him, that the very Boat Men, profane as they were, abhorr'd him. From whence I infer, that
<PB N="16" REF="004631_0009_100DB1CD27097050"/>
was the Devil himself to appear as he is, the wicked∣est Sinners could not but detest him.</P>
<P>This Afternoon I began to feel the Power of Faith more than ever I did before, and to find that as the Day, so will our Strength be. When I went into the Boat the Sea run dangerously high; but I could boldly say:</P>
<LG>
<L>GOD is our Refuge in Distress,</L>
<L>A present Help when Dangers press;</L>
<L>In Him undaunted we'll confide,</L>
<L>Tho' Earth were from her Center toss'd,</L>
<L>And Mountains in the Ocean lost,</L>
<L>Torn piecemeal by the roaring Tide.</L>
</LG>
<P>About Five we got safe to <HI>Margate,</HI> where ha∣ving received a little bodily Refreshment, and re∣commended our selves to GOD in Prayer, we went about the Town to buy the Things we came for. The Generality of the People we met with were civilized and teachable.</P>
<P>After we had done our secular Business, we paid the Curate a Visit, the Minister being at <HI>Canterbury:</HI> He received us most courteously: Our Conversation was such as tended to the Use of Edifying; it ran chiefly upon the great Importance of the Ministerial Function; the Necessity of Preaching up the Doc∣trine of the New Birth; and the Necessity and Be∣nefit of Visiting from House to House.</P>
<P>About Ten we left him, greatly refreshed in Spi∣rit, and thankful to GOD for exciting Persons every where to entertain us.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="004631_0009_100DB1CD27097050"/>On the Morrow I sent him Mr. <HI>Law's Serious Call</HI> and <HI>Christian Perfection,</HI> with some other Books; and also a few Catechisms and Sermons to some other serious People, whom Providence put in our Way. Now <HI>Thanks be to GOD,</HI> saith the Apostle, <HI>which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the Savour of his Knowledge to us in every Place!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, Jan.</HI> 10. About Four this Morning, Mr. <HI>H.</HI> and I arose, intending to go on board immedi∣ately; but the Wind blew so very violent, that by the Advice of the Boat-Men we deferred going on board 'till Daylight; and therefore after we had kneeled on the Shore, and prayed for ourselves and others, we went back to the Inn; and took that Op∣portunity of writing to a Friend, or two.</P>
<P>About Seven we took Boat and praised and bles∣sed GOD to see the Floods clap their Hands. About Eight we came on board, and found we had great Reason to be thankful that we were on Shore last Night: The Sailors told us that the Lightning shone on the Sea all Night; and that the Storm was very great, and the Ship's Long-Boat was lost.</P>
<P>I read publick Prayers, returned publick Thanks for our Deliverance, and expounded by Way of Ser∣mon the Second Article of the <HI>Creed,</HI> which I began Yesterday. Did the same after Evening Prayers. Spent the Remainder of the Day in writing Letters; and have not enjoy'd a more calm delightful Frame of Mind a long Time.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="004631_0010_100DB1CEE05D8D90"/> The Sick encreased on my Hands, but were very thankful for furnishing them with Sage-Tea, Sugar, Broth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> At the Sight of so many Objects of Pity, I was sensibly touched with a fellow feeling of their Miseries. I could not but transverse the <HI>Prodigal's</HI> Complaint, <HI>How many of my Father's Children are ready to perish with Hunger, whilst I have enough and to spare.</HI></P>
<P>Had a most comfortable Sense of the Divine Pre∣sence with me in many Particulars: And in the Evening, joined in Intercession with my other Com∣panions on Deck, in Behalf of absent Friends and all Mankind.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday, Jan.</HI> 11. Weighed from <HI>Margate</HI> Road, and cast Anchor in the <HI>Downs,</HI> the Ship sail∣ing most pleasantly before the Wind. Wrote seve∣ral Letters whilst the Ship was under Sail. Had my Spirits mightily refreshed upon our Arrival in the <HI>Downs,</HI> by hearing from two or three Christian Bre∣thren at <HI>London;</HI> and was desirous to bless GOD for a providential Opportunity that was offered of send∣ing a whole Packet to them and some other Friends, to acquaint them how lovingly the LORD had dealt with me. <HI>O that the Mercies bestowed on me, may through the Thanksgiving of many redound to the Glory of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>Had no publick Prayers this Morning, being much hurried in writing Letters to go by Post; and when I went to read, the Soldiers were engaged in their military Affairs upon Deck, so that I did no∣thing
<PB N="19" REF="004631_0010_100DB1CEE05D8D90"/>
thing but visit the Sick. I fear I did foolishly▪ <HI>Father, forgive me for thy dear Son's sake.</HI></P>
<P>Went on in explaining the Creed after Evening Prayers, and was enabled to talk of the Crucifixion of our LORD: I believe it pricked them to the Heart. <HI>O that I could hear them cry out, What shall we do to be saved?</HI></P>
<P>Had the Comfort to hear good was done among the Soldiers; and the Captain was pleased to ex∣press his Approbation of my Conduct. <HI>GOD grant I may with a single Eye seek to please the Captain of my Salvation!</HI></P>
<P>After Evening Prayers and visiting the Sick, went ashore with Mr. <HI>H.</HI> to <HI>Deal</HI>; and was so highly delighted with a Prospect of the <HI>Downs,</HI> that we expressed our Thankfulness in singing of Psalms all the Way. The Boat-Men I believe wondered at it at first; but they were not ashamed to <HI>blaspheme,</HI> and I thought had no Reason to be ashamed to <HI>praise</HI> GOD. I had the Satisfaction before we got to <HI>Deal,</HI> to hear one of them join seriously with us; and per∣ceived a surprising Alteration in their Behaviour always after, <HI>Blessed be GOD</HI>!</P>
<P>About Five we got to <HI>Deal,</HI> and not knowing a single Person, went (as at <HI>Margate</HI>) to pay my Re∣spects to the two Ministers of the Place: But find∣ing neither of them at Home, spent the Remainder of the Evening with my Friend <HI>H.</HI> very comforta∣bly in religious Talk, Family Prayer, interceding for absent Friends and all Mankind, and writing to
<PB N="20" REF="004631_0011_100DB1D0F2098A30"/>
Christian Brethren. And even here GOD did not leave my Ministry without a Witness; for he was pleased to impress something I said on a poor Wo∣man's Heart, that providentially came in, and joined with us in Family Prayer: for which we endea∣voured to thank him. <HI>Behold how great a Fire this little Spark kindled before we left</HI> Deal!</P>
<P><HI>Thursday, Jan.</HI> 12. Spent most of the Morning in writing Letters: Went about Eleven on board▪ and was highly delighted with the Prospect on the <HI>Downs,</HI> which was exceeding calm; and a great ma∣ny beautiful Ships which were riding here added to the Prospect. <HI>O that Men who occupy their Business in the great Waters, would (since they cannot but see) admire GOD's Wonders in the Deep!</HI></P>
<P>Read Prayers and went on explaining the <HI>Creed</HI> to the Soldiers; visited and prayed with the Sick; and began this Afternoon to explain the <HI>Catechism</HI> to the Women by themselves: I find they are in Number about sixteen; and blessed be GOD were much affected. <HI>Prosper thou, O LORD, this Work of my Hands upon me!</HI></P>
<P>Had some religious Talk with the Surgeon of the Soldiers, who seems very well disposed. I sel∣dom (it ever) see him idle, and find he has many good Qualities. <HI>GOD grant Christianity may be grafted in him!</HI></P>
<P>After Evening Prayers and explaining the <HI>Creed,</HI> went again to <HI>Deal</HI> with Mr. <HI>H.</HI> to buy some Ne∣cessaries for our Companions. Spent the Remain∣der
<PB N="21" REF="004631_0011_100DB1D0F2098A30"/>
of the Evening in writing Letters, and reading and praying with eight or nine poor People, who came I suppose at the Report of the other poor Wo∣man to hear me.</P>
<P><HI>Friday, Jan.</HI> 13. Remained all Day on Shore, the Weather being too rough to go on board: Was in Care about leaving my Flock so long; but hope this short Absence will make our Meeting more agreeable To-morrow. Had the Pleasure of joining in publick Workship at <HI>Deal,</HI> in a pretty Chapel; which was more agreeable on account of our being confined for some Time within the narrow Limits of a Ship.</P>
<P>Set apart this Day as a Day of Humiliation, Ab∣stinence, and Intercession for Friends and all Man∣kind, and found my Heart greatly enlarged in that divine Exercise. <HI>Intercession is a glorious Means to sweeten the Heart!</HI></P>
<P>Spent the Remainder of the Day, and sat up till One in the Morning in writing to Friends.</P>
<P>Had two or three added to my Company at Night, who seemed very attentive, and prayed for me most heartily. <HI>The Poor receive the Gospel.</HI> I dispersed some Books among them, as I saw proper: <HI>I hope GOD will give them his Blessing.</HI></P>
<P>Expected Letters to night from <HI>London,</HI> but was disappointed: <HI>GOD enable me in every thing to give Thanks!</HI></P>
<P>Fancied myself all this Day in my little Cell at <HI>Oxford</HI>: For I have not spent so many Hours in
<PB N="22" REF="004631_0012_100DB1D359A87758"/>
sweet Retirement since I left the University. The Pleasure I felt was inexpressible.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Jan.</HI> 14. Spent the Morning in writing Letters, and was much pleased with the pious Con∣versation of a poor Woman, who was one of my Auditors last Night, and who I believe, has passed through the Pangs of the New Birth.</P>
<P>Hasted on board about Eleven, (the Wind pro∣mising fair) to take us out of the Channel, and was affectionately received by the People.</P>
<P>I was greatly delighted to see all the Ships sail together from the <HI>Downs.</HI> Nature, indeed, would have been glad to have staid till the Morrow, that I might have received Letters from my <HI>London</HI> Friends, but God, I considered, ordereth all Things for the Good of those that love him, and therefore gave Thanks from my Heart. Examined into the State of my little Ones, (my Friend <HI>H</HI>'s Charge) and had Reason to hope well of them.</P>
<P>Was enlarged in preaching after Prayers to the Soldiers, and spent two most pleasant Hours in read∣ing GOD's holy Word. At Night, though it was piercingly cold, we continued instant in Intercession on Deck; and the Prospect of a clear Sky, the Stars glittering, and the Moon shining bright warmed my Heart, and made me <HI>greatly rejoice in Spirit.</HI> I now began to be more reconciled to a Ship Life; for GOD gave me Health of Body, and without which all is nothing, Content ot Mind. Had near an Hour's Conversation with one who, I hope, will be∣come
<PB N="23" REF="004631_0012_100DB1D359A87758"/>
come an altogether Christian. <HI>Oh that that blessed Time would come.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, Jan.</HI> 15. GOD gave me and Mr. <HI>H.</HI> sweet Sleep. Had near two Hours Retirement in the Captain's round House, and was much delighted with singing Psalms on Deck with my Companions. Read publick Prayers in the Cabbin this Morning, and was much enlarged in preaching to the Soldiers on this Article, <HI>I believe in the Holy Ghost:</HI> In treat∣ing of which, I took Occasion to shew the Nature and Necessity of the New Birth; a Subject on which I delight to dwell.</P>
<P>Catechised the Soldiers, and, blessed be GOD, find some of them improved. Was enlarged again in my Evening Sermon to the Soldiers, and had Prayers a second Time in the great Cabbin, which gave me no small Satisfaction; the Officers, <HI>&amp;c,</HI> willingly comply'd as soon as I imposed it; <HI>GOD be praised!</HI></P>
<P>Had great Delight in reading the Holy Scrip∣tures, enjoyed an unspeakable Peace of Mind, and was much comforted in interceding for Friends, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> on Deck. The Weather was cold, and the Wind blew very hard; but when the Heart is full of GOD, outward Things affect it little. <HI>Surely my Friends in</HI> England <HI>pray for me; methinks I feel they do.</HI></P>
<P>All the Day the Sea was entirely becalmed; eve∣ry thing about us seem hush'd quiet, as though it would remind us of that sacred Rest the Day was set apart to commemorate. In the Evening the
<PB N="24" REF="004631_0013_100DB1D6F1010B40"/>
Wind blew very fresh but being full against us, we were obliged to sail back to the <HI>Downs</HI> (though we had got near fifty Miles) where we arrived about Twelve a Clock.</P>
<P><HI>Monday, Jan.</HI> 16. After private Prayer, was most agreeably entertained with some Letters from my <HI>London</HI> Friends, which filled my Soul with unspeaka∣ble Pleasure, and caused me to shed Tears of Joy. <HI>If the Correspondence of good People is so transporting here, O! how unspeakably revishing must the Personal Communion of Saints be hereafter. Hasten, O LORD, that blessed Time and let thy Kingdom come.</HI></P>
<P>Was a little affected by seeing a poor Soldier tied Neck and Heels, for several mutinous Words he had spoken. The Captain related the Case to me, and said, if I could make him sensible of his Crime, I might beg him off. I endeavoured to do it, but, alas, in vain; he continued obstinate, and thereby hindred my Design taking Effect. After this, the Captain order'd him to be tied down between Decks; from whence I took Occasion, in my Morning Ser∣mon, to exhort the Soldiers to obey them That <HI>had the Rule over them,</HI> and to avoid those Sins, that would provoke GOD to command them to be <HI>tied Hand and Foot, and to be cast into outer Darkness, where would be weeping and gnashing of Teeth.</HI></P>
<P>About Twelve, a <HI>Deal</HI> Boat coming along Side, I was minded to go on Shore to answer my Letters. The Sea was very boisterous, but God brought us to Shore rejoicing. <HI>O wherefore did I in the least fear? What am I, when left to myself.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="004631_0013_100DB1D6F1010B40"/>It being the 16th Day of the Month, Mr. <HI>H.</HI> and I joined in an Hour's Intercession and Abstinence, with all those that meet together to bewail thier own and the Sins of the Nation. About Four, took some bodily Refreshment; and from thence till One in the Morning, continued answering my Correspon∣dents, having first spread their Letters before the LORD in Prayer, and begg'd that I might send them Answers of Peace.</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, Jan.</HI> 17. Was awaken'd with an Alarm, that the Ship was ready to sail, but found it soon con∣tradicted. Spent an Hour in particular Intercession, and the rest of the Morning in writing Letters, and teaching Mr. <HI>H.</HI> Latin. <HI>Oh that I may be made an Instrument of breeding him up for GOD!</HI></P>
<P>Came on board about Two in the Afternoon, and found all Things quiet in the Ship, was most kindly recieved; and I observed the Women were very at∣tentive when I proceeded to explain the Catechism to them. <HI>May GOD open their Hearts as he did that of</HI> Lydia, <HI>that these may give diligent Heed to the Things that are spoken.</HI></P>
<P>Was much enlarged in my Evening Discourse, and hope the Word entered into their Hearts. Was kindly invited by the Post Master of <HI>Deal,</HI> to lye at his House. Gained an Opportunity, by walking at Night on Deck, after Intercession, to talk closely to the chief Mate, and one of the Serjeants of the Re∣giment, and hope my Words were not altogether spoken in vain. <HI>O that all Men would come to the
<PB N="26" REF="004631_0014_100DB1D97A658A08"/>
Knowledge of the Truth, and be saved!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wednesday, Jan.</HI> 18. Spent all the Morning in Retirement, reading the Scriptures, publick Prayer and preaching; the Weather being extremely plea∣sant.</P>
<P>Began to live by Rule more than ever; for no∣thing I find is to be done without it. All that had been sick being recovered, came to Prayers, for whom I gave Thanks; particularly to them: At the End of my Sermon exhorting them with the ut∣most Earnestness, to <HI>Sin no more least a worse Evil should befal them,</HI> and to shew forth their Thankful∣ness, not only with their Lips, but in their Lives <HI>O that there may be always in them such a Mind!</HI></P>
<P>Finished my Exposition on the <HI>Creed.</HI> Read pub∣lick Prayers, and preached as usual in the Afternoon Catechised both my own Companions and the Sol∣diers; and was pleased to see many others very at∣tentive to hear</P>
<P>Had great Comfort in reading the Scriptures Was afterwards a little inclined to Heaviness, but drove it off by a long Intercession. <HI>Prayer is an Antidote against every Evil.</HI></P>
<P>Upon Examination, had Reason to hope my Com∣panions grew in Grace; <HI>blessed be GOD for it!</HI></P>
<P>About Eleven at Night went and sat down among the Sailors in the Steerage, and reasoned with them <HI>about Righteousness, Temperance, and a Judgement to come</HI>; at which some of them almost <HI>trembled.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday, Jan.</HI> 19. Was much comforted by hear∣ing
<PB N="27" REF="004631_0014_100DB1D97A658A08"/>
from my Friends. Began, after Prayers this Morning, to explain the Catechism to the Soldiers, and draw proper Inferences by way of Sermon: I find it is much approved of, and, for them, by far the fittest Way of Instruction.</P>
<P>Spent the Afternoon in answering Correspondents; was much assisted in my Evening Exposition on the Catechism; and had great Hopes of two Soldiers becoming Christians indeed. <HI>Would to GOD, all the King's Soldiers were such!</HI></P>
<P>Was enabled to compose a great Part of a new Sermon this Evening. Enlarged in Intercession, and Afterwards much rejoiced by three more Letters, and sat up till One in the Morning to answer them. <HI>Whatsover thou findest in thy Hand to do,</HI> saith the wise Man, <HI>do it with all thy Might.</HI></P>
<P>We had now such a calm and smooth Sea, that all the People every where expressed their Admiration of it. <HI>GOD grant that we may in a Calm provide for a Storm, and, like the primitive Christians, when the Churches had Rest, walk in the Comforts of the Holy Ghost, and be edified!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, Jan.</HI> 20. Rose with great Peace of Mind,
spent all the Morning in composing a Sermon.</P>
<P>Happily composed a Difference between a Sol∣dier and his Wife, who were one of the four Couple I married when first I came on board: The Man had resolved to leave her, but upon my reminding him of his Marriage Vow, and entreating him with Love, he immediately took to her again. <HI>What
<PB N="28" REF="004631_0015_100DB1DB9162F938"/>
may not a Minister do through Christ, when his Flock love him?</HI> Almost finished the Sermon I began Yesterday, <HI>blessed of GOD!</HI></P>
<P>Went on in expounding the <HI>Catechism</HI> after Even∣ing Prayer; and now began to read the first Lesson, which I purposely omitted before, not knowing they would bear it, and willing to imitate <HI>Jacob, who was careful of his little Ones not to over drive them.</HI></P>
<P>Proposed to the Captain to read a few Prayers in the Great Cabbin every Night, which he really con∣sented to, and withal said, he should be glad to hear me preach, whenever I should think proper.</P>
<P>Was surprised in the midst of my Evening's Dis∣course by the chief Mate, who came and told me, that the Minister of <HI>Upper Deal</HI> had sent a Boat for me, desiring me immediately to come on Shore. Accordingly, after I had concluded, Mr. <HI>H.</HI> and I went and found the Minister, which was left to of∣ficiate, who desired me, at the Request of the Inha∣bitants, to preach the <HI>Sunday</HI> following. After this, we retired to our Lodging in <HI>Deal</HI>; and after a Ser∣mon and long Intercession, was unspeakably com∣forted by the Reception of several Letters from Per∣sons, who, I believe sincerely fear GOD. At which my Heart was so full, that I could not but kneel down, pray, and return Thanks to GOD for them.</P>
<P>Found the Number of my Hearers greatly in∣creased to-night, and very joyful to see me once more on Shore. I sate up till One in the Morning, an∣swering my Correspondents, and then laid down,
<PB N="29" REF="004631_0015_100DB1DB9162F938"/>
filled with such <HI>Joy as no Man could take from me, nor a Stranger intermeddle with. Oh that all Men knew the Comforts of Religion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Jan.</HI> 21. Spent all the Day in writing Letters, and delightful Conversation with Mr. <HI>H.</HI></P>
<P>At Night, the Number of my Hearers was so in∣creased, that the Stairs were full, as well as my Room. I expounded to them the 25th of St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> at which they were much affected, and seemed to love and pray for me most earnestly: <HI>And I desire to have no greater Portion than the Prayers of the Poor.</HI></P>
<P>Sate up till One, writing Letters; gave Thanks for the Blessing of the Week, and then lay down in Peace, hoping to rise early the next Morning, more fit for my Master's Service.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, Jan.</HI> 22. About Nine went on board with Capt. <HI>W.</HI> who is always extremely civil. Visited the Sick, and read Prayers in the Great Cabbin. Read Prayers, and preached my Sermon on <HI>Early Piety,</HI> on open Deck to the Soldiers; the Officers, and other Gentlemen, attending very seriously. The Weather was very cold, <HI>but Preaching warmed my Heart.</HI></P>
<P>About Noon went on Shore with Capt. <HI>W.</HI> and Mr. <HI>H.</HI> Dined at the Post-Master's, who received us hospitably. Afternoon preached at <HI>Upper Deal,</HI> on <HI>Acts</HI> xxviii. 26. Many seemed pricked to the Heart, and some so quickened, that they expressed a Desire to follow me wherever I should go. <HI>O free Grace in JESUS CHRIST!</HI> I have scarce known a
<PB N="30" REF="004631_0016_100DB1DE6005E040"/>
Time I have preached any where, but I have seen some Effect of my Doctrine. <HI>From the Hearts of the Mighty the Word of the LORD hath not turned back, the Sword of the Spirit returned not empty.</HI> A Proof this, I hope, that the Words are not my own, but that GOD is with me of a Truth: <HI>May I never, by Pride and Vain Glory, provoke him to depart from me!</HI></P>
<P>Stayed all Night on Shore, to expound the <HI>Lord's Prayer,</HI> and had a large Company to hear me, and should have had seven Hundred, as my Hostess told me, would the House have held them: <HI>So swiftly run the Word of GOD and prevailed.</HI></P>
<P>Was again refreshed by receiving five Letters: Sat up till past Ten, to answer some of them; and then went to Rest, with comfortable Reflections of GOD's unmerited loving Kindness to me.</P>
<LG>
<L>Ten thousand thousand precious Gifts</L>
<L>My pious Thanks employ:</L>
<L>Nor is the least a thankful Heart</L>
<L>That tastes those Gifts with Joy.</L>
<L>Through all Eternity, to GOD</L>
<L>My grateful Song I'll raise,</L>
<L>But, Oh! Eternity's too short</L>
<L>To set forth all his Praise!</L>
</LG>
<P><HI>Monday, Jan.</HI> 23. Was much comforted by re∣ceiving five more Letters; answered some of them; and about Eleven in the Morning went on board the <HI>Amy,</HI> to pay my Respects to Colonel C. and to visit
<PB N="31" REF="004631_0016_100DB1DE6005E040"/>
the Soldiers, whom I looked upon as Part of my Charge. I was received very civilly by the Offi∣cers; went among the Soldiers, enquired into the State of their Souls, gave them a Word or two of Exhortation; promised to bring them some Books [I saw their Wants], and (at the Officer's Request) to come and preach to them, if Opportunity should offer, before we left the <HI>Downs.</HI></P>
<P>After this, I visited the <HI>Lightfoot,</HI> our other Trans∣port Ship, in which were about twelve Soldiers and a Serjeant: they received me kindly. I sat down and conversed with them; promised to send them some Books, and to come and preach to them also, if Providence should permit. The <HI>Downs</HI> being ex∣ceeding calm, and the Weather clear, going from Ship to Ship was very pleasant. <HI>Mine are but little Flocks, O that it may be my heavenly Father's good Pleasure to give them the Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>About Two went again on board the <HI>Amy,</HI> to dine with the Officers, being kindly invited by them when I was before on board: They all treated me with great Kindness, and in the midst of our Meal was most agreeably surprised by the coming of two <HI>Lon∣don</HI> Friends, who made a Journey from thence <HI>(O unmerited Love)</HI> on purpose to see me.</P>
<P>Dinner being ended, I went and dispersed some Books among the Soldiers; took my Leave and hastened on board my own Ship; read Prayers and preached, and then went on Shore with my Friends, not being a little rejoiced to see them.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="004631_0017_100DB1E1F2C40478"/> <HI>Jan.</HI> 23. This Night GOD let me see greater Things than before, for so many came to hear me that the poor Landlady that owned the House where I lodged sent to her Tenants, beseeching them to let no more come in for fear the Floor should break under them; and indeed there were such Numbers that I first expounded the Creed to about eighty, and then the second Lesson to as many more; among whom I observed there were many of the chief In∣habitants.</P>
<P>About Eleven they went, and I then rejoiced with my Friends for what GOD had done for my Soul, eat a little Food, interceded for absent Friends, and all Mankind, and went to Bed about Two in the Morning. <HI>O what shall I render unto the LORD for all the Mercies he pours down upon me!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, Jan.</HI> 24. Spent all the Morning in wri∣ting Letters, walking, singing of Psalms, and Inter∣cession all along the Sea Shore, from whence we had a most delightful Prospect of the <HI>Downs,</HI> which af∣forded me and my Friends most noble Matter for Praise and Thanksgiving. Met with a little Oppo∣sition to day; but I should have wondered indeed, if such an effectual Door had been opened for <HI>preaching Christ,</HI> and there had been no Adversa∣ries. Nothing has done more Harm to the Chri∣stian Church than thinking the Examples recorded in the Holy Scriptures, were written only to be read and not imitated by us.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="004631_0017_100DB1E1F2C40478"/>More People came to hear me to Night than ever, so that I divided them into two Companies again, and providentially from the second Lesson for the Morning, had a glorious Opportunity for shew∣ing the absolute Unlawfulness of running or buying Run Goods, a Sin that doth most easily beset the <HI>Deal</HI> People.</P>
<P>After Exposition paid Mr. <HI>E.</HI> a Visit, who most kindly entertained us, and offered me his Boat to go or come on Shore when I pleased, which would save me much Expence. After we returned from his House, we kneeled down on the Sea Shore, and prayed for them that opposed themselves, and then went to Bed, blessing and praising GOD.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday, Jan.</HI> 25. Went on board in the Morn∣ing with my Friends, intending to read Prayers and preach to the Soldiers, but they were engaged about their own Affairs, and I could not stay long.— Had great Civilities shewed us by the Officers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who treated my Friends respectfully, and the Captain, upon my Request, pardoned a Woman who other∣wise was to have been sent on Shore.</P>
<P>After Breakfast, return'd on Shore with my Friends, and read Prayers, and preached at <HI>Upper-Deal</HI> to a large Congregation; I was surprised to see such a Number of People, but all <HI>Deal</HI> seems to be in a holy Flame, and, was I prepared for it, I should see still greater Things than these.</P>
<P>Dined at Mr. <HI>R</HI>'s, a Grocer in <HI>Deal,</HI> with my Friends; we were most hospitably entertained, and
<PB N="34" REF="004631_0018_100DB1E43B47DF70"/>
what was far better, had an excellent Opportunity given me of discoursing for a considerable Time on our Fall in <HI>Adam,</HI> and the Necessity of our New Birth in JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>Expounded to two Companies again at Night the Epistle for the Morning, and the two Lessons for the Evening, as most suitable for the Day, and was enabled to do it with Power: More People came to Night than before, so that they now did actually put a Prop under the Floor of the Room. Was agree∣ably entertained with more Letters, and tho' the Duty of the Day had a little fatigued me, yet GOD strengthened me to sit up till Three in the Morning, answering my Christian Correspondents. <HI>They that wait upon the LORD shall renew their Strength.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday, Jan.</HI> 26. I had a Visit paid me by an Anabaptist Teacher, who came to discourse with me about the Things that belonged to the Kingdom of GOD. By what I could find he was a spiritual Man. I asked him several Questions about taking the ministerial Function, without being called as was <HI>Aaron</HI>; but he did not answer me to my Satis∣faction; however, we both agreed in this, That <HI>un∣less a Man be born again, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>I was much comforted by the coming of two more Friends from <HI>London,</HI> with whom I took sweet Comfort, and could not but fancy myself once more at <HI>London,</HI> being surrounded with religious Intimates.</P>
<LG>
<PB N="35" REF="004631_0018_100DB1E43B47DF70"/>
<L>How sweet must their Advantage be,</L>
<L>How great their Pleasure prove,</L>
<L>Who live like Brethren, and consent</L>
<L>In Offices of Love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis like refreshing Dew, which does</L>
<L>On <HI>Hermon</HI>'s Top distill,</L>
<L>Or like the early Drops that fall</L>
<L>On <HI>Zion</HI>'s fruitful Hill.</L>
</LG>
<P>In the Afternoon I took my Friends on board, read Prayers and preached to the Soldiers; after this, went on Shore, sung Psalms with my Friends, and then expounded to the People, who now encreased so much that I was obliged to divide them into three Companies, and GOD enabled me to continue ex∣pounding three Hours without any Intermission, or the least Weariness. <HI>Thanks be to GOD for his strength∣ning Grace! As our Day is, so shall our Strength be.</HI></P>
<P>Received three more Letters, and sat up till One in the Morning to answer some sent before, and then went to Bed rejoicing and blessing GOD for the great Things he had done for me. But withal desirous to say with the Divine <HI>Herbert,</HI></P>
<P>Less than the least of GOD's Mercies <HI>shall be my Motto still.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, Jan.</HI> 27. Spent the Beginning of the Morning in writing Letters, then breakfasted with all my Friends at one Mrs. <HI>H</HI>'s, a Widow Gentle∣woman, who kindly invited, and as kindly enter∣tained us. <HI>The LORD reward her a thousand fold.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="004631_0019_100DB1E6A27C6268"/>About Twelve I came on board, being unwilling to be absent from my proper Charge long together. I was received kindly, visited the Sick and catechised the Soldiers, some of whom answered most aptly, for which I distributed amongst all something I knew would be agreeable. <HI>Oh! that I may catch them by a holy Guile! but that Power belongeth only unto GOD.</HI></P>
<P>About Two came a Clergyman on board, from a neighbouring Village to pay me a Visit, with whom I spent an Hour or two agreeably, had Prayers on open Deck, and inforced the Duty of keeping holy the <HI>Sabbath Day,</HI> which then came in Course to be explained, but was afraid to sing a Psalm, Mr. <HI>H.</HI> being at <HI>Deal</HI> with friends. <HI>Where was my Courage then? LORD, what am I when left to myself!</HI></P>
<P>At Five returned ashore with the Clergyman, to whom I promised some Books for his Parishioners. Expounded three Hours to three Companies, as be∣fore. Glad Tidings of great Joy sent me by four or five Correspondents, sat up till One in the Morning answering them, and then went to Bed and had a feel∣ing Possession of my GOD. <HI>And will GOD in very deed, dwell in this Heart of mine? O free Grace in CHRIST! Praise the LORD, O my Soul, and all that is within me praise his holy Name!</HI></P>
<P>Spent the Morning most agreeably in Conversa∣tion, Intercession for all Friends, and all Mankind▪ walking on the Sea Shore.</P>
<P>Dined with Mrs. <HI>St. L.</HI> who hospitably entertain'd us. Went about Three in the Afternoon, intending
<PB N="37" REF="004631_0019_100DB1E6A27C6268"/>
to go on board, but could not, which gave me a lit∣tle Uneasiness, thinking it by no Means right to leave my Flock so long.</P>
<P>At Night I expounded to three Companies more numerous than before. Received Letters, and sat up till One in the Morning answering them, and went to sleep in order to fit myself for the Duties of the following <HI>Sabbath.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, Jan.</HI> 29. Went on board early in the Morning, read Prayers, and preached to the Soldiers, and visited the Sick; then return'd on Shore, and, accompanied with a Troop of pious Friends, hasted to <HI>Shroulden</HI> Church, about a Mile and half distant from <HI>Deal.</HI> Where I preach'd to a weeping throng'd Congregation, at the Request of the Minister, who at my Request, gave me and my Friends the Bles∣sed Sacrament. Others staid also, to the Number of sixteen: And (which I never observed before) the Clerk pronounced a loud <HI>Amen</HI> to every Person that received either Bread or Wine: An excellent Cus∣tom, and worthy in my Opinion to be imitated in all Churches.</P>
<P>After this, I and my Friends went on our Way rejoicing, and dined comfortably at Mr. <HI>R</HI>'s, and in the Afternoon preach'd at <HI>Upper-Deal.</HI> The Church was quite crowded, and many went away for Want of Room; some stood on the Leads of the Church on the outside, and looked in at the Top Windows, and all seem'd eager to hear the Word of GOD. I preach'd against Worldly-Mindedness, and had great
<PB N="38" REF="004631_0020_100DB1E99AA624C0"/>
Reason to think GOD gave it his Blessing.</P>
<P>The Weather was exceeding pleasant, and seeing the People go in such Flocks over the Fields, put me in mind of our Blessed LORD's Words, when he saw the People coming in Companies from <HI>Samaria: The Fields are white already to Harvest.</HI> I then pray'd, that he would be pleased to enable me to <HI>gather Wheat into his heavenly Garner.</HI></P>
<P>In the Evening, such Numbers came to hear me, that I was oblig'd to divide them into four Compa∣nies; and GOD enabled me to expound to them from Six till Ten. Some would have persuaded me to have dismiss'd the last Company without Expound∣ing, but I could not bear to let so many go empty away. And I find the more we do for GOD, the more we may. My Strength held out surprisingly; I was but little if at all fatigued; or if I had, I should have been sufficiently recompensed by some Letters, which I received from my dear Friends, which gave me unspeakable Satisfaction: And after I had perused them, I took a little Refreshment, rejoiced and gave Thanks with my Friends for the Blessings of the Day, and went to our respective Beds about Twelve at Night. <HI>Oh! Who can express the Loving Kindness of the LORD, or shew forth all his Praise?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, Jan.</HI> 30. At the Request of the Inhabi∣tants, and the Leave of Mr. <HI>R.</HI> (who sent from <HI>Can∣terbury</HI> a most obliging Message) I preached again at <HI>Upper-Deal</HI> to as crouded and attentive Audience as I had Yesterday; and afterwards I and Mr. <HI>H.</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="004631_0020_100DB1E99AA624C0"/>
waited upon the Rev. Mr. <HI>W.</HI> who read Prayers, and most courteously invited me to come and see him. Our Conversation run chiefly on the Excel∣lency of Baptising Infants at <HI>Church.</HI> I continued with him about an Hour; and then at his Request visited a poor Woman of the Parish, who was grie∣vously troubled in Mind: And GOD was pleased to bless my Ministry to her Comfort. <HI>To him be all the Glory!</HI></P>
<LG>
<L>So poor, so frail an Instrument,</L>
<L>If Thou, my GOD, vouchsafe to use,</L>
<L>'Tis Praise enough to be employ'd,</L>
<L>Reward enough if thou excuse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If thou excuse, then work thy Will,</L>
<L>By so unfit an Instrument;</L>
<L>It will at once thy Goodness show,</L>
<L>And prove thy Pow'r Omnipotent.</L>
</LG>
<P>Soon after this we went to Mr. <HI>R</HI>'s, where our Friends expected us: But we had not been long there, before the Wind shifted about on a sudden, and a Cry came, <HI>The Wind is fair, prepare yourselves for Sailing.</HI> I received the News with an humble Joy. But Sorrow, I perceived, filled the Hearts of my dear Friends, who came from <HI>London</HI> to see me. We immediately retired, intending to intercede for all Mankind before we parted: But the People were in such a Hurry, for fear the Sea should grow too tempestuous to go off, that we were obliged to be very brief. Having therefore recommended ourselves
<PB N="40" REF="004631_0021_100DB1EB3591BAD8"/>
to GOD, I took my Leave. But Oh, what Affecti∣on did the <HI>Deal</HI> People express to my unworthy Person! for no sooner were they apprized of the Wind being fair, but they came running in Droves after me to the Sea-Shore, wishing me good Luck in the Name of the LORD; and with Tears, and other Expressions of Kindness, praying for my Suc∣cess and safe Return. I was confounded with a Sense of GOD's Mercies to me.</P>
<P>The Sea was very boisterous indeed, and the Waves rose Mountains high: But GOD was pleased to give Mr. <HI>H.</HI> and me an unusual Degree of Faith, and we went on singing Psalms and praising GOD, the Water dashing in our Faces all the Way. Doubt∣less we were in Jeopardy, <HI>But wherefore should we fear, having so many on Shore praying for us?</HI></P>
<P>About Five we came on board, and were receiv'd with Joy: For the Ship was under Sail, and the People were afraid I should be left behind. As I was going into the great Cabbin, I fell down the Steerage Stairs; but received little or no Hurt. Af∣ter we had sailed for a short Time, the Man of War not moving, we cast Anchor again. Mr. <HI>H.</HI> was so sick by the Ship's Motion after we came on board, that he was obliged to go to Bed.</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, Jan.</HI> 31. Spent the Morning in writing Letters, visiting the Sick, reading Prayers and preach∣ing to the Soldiers.</P>
<P>About Twelve was pleasingly surprised with ano∣ther Sight of my <HI>London</HI> Friends, who stayed at <HI>Deal</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="004631_0021_100DB1EB3591BAD8"/>
all Night, and finding the Ship did not sail, came with some more <HI>Deal</HI> Friends to take me on Shore, that I might bid them once more farewel. I was a little unwilling at first, but by their Importunity and affectionate Intreaties they even compelled me. I accordingly went with them, singing Psalms and praising GOD all the Way.</P>
<P>But I had scarce been on Shore an Hour before the Man of War gave a Signal for sailing; and so we were obliged to hasten back on board. The People expressed much Joy at seeing me come to <HI>Deal</HI> again, and accompanied me to the Sea Shore, as before.</P>
<P>The Weather being fair, we went on board with Pleasure: The Ship was under Sail, but we met with it, and were received affectionately. <HI>I hope that these frequent and sudden Removes will put me in mind that I have here no continuing City; and stir me up to live so holily, that was GOD at any time to say, This Night shall thy Soul be required of thee; I might with Plea∣sure say, Lo I come!</HI></P>
<P>Another Thing I could not but reflect on Yester∣day, when I saw <HI>Deal</HI> all in a Confusion when the Wind shifted about so suddenly, some crying for one thing, some another, but all anxious least their Ship should sail without them. <HI>Alas! I what Confusion</HI> (thought I) <HI>will the Inhabitants of the World be in, when in a Moment, in the Twinkling of an Eye, they shall hear the Voice of the Archangel and Trump of GOD, crying aloud, Arise, ye dead, and come to Judgment!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="004631_0022_100DB1ED56EE8F48"/>After I was on board, I preached, read Prayers to the Soldiers, visited the Sick, wrote some Letters, and interceded for all Mankind; and retired to Bed about Twelve.</P>
<P>Our Ship sailed briskly for a few Hours; but the Wind shifting again, was obliged to return back once more, and we cast Anchor in the <HI>Downs</HI> about Nine at Night.</P>
<P>After this, I went chearfully about my Ministe∣rial Business, visited the Sick, read Prayers and preached to the Soldiers, answered some Letters I had received in the Morning.</P>
<P>Sent some Books for the Soldiers on Board the <HI>Lightfoot</HI>; and at Night went on Shore at <HI>Deal</HI> with Mr. <HI>H.</HI> where we were most kindly received, and courteously entertained and lodged at Mr. <HI>R</HI>'s: <HI>The LORD reward him a thousand fold!</HI></P>
<P>Did nothing that Night, it being late, save that I visited a sick Person at her earnest Desire and the Minister's Consent, and talked about half an Hour on the Benefit of Afflictions.</P>
<P>Answered two or three Letters I received after I came on Shore; prayed with some well-disposed People that were at Mr. <HI>R</HI>'s, and about Twelve went to Bed.</P>
<P><HI>Thursday, Feb.</HI> 2. Rose early in the Morning went on board in Mr. <HI>E</HI>'s Boat, intending to read Prayers and preach to the Soldiers, and then return to <HI>Upper-Deal</HI> to preach there, being asked to do so by the Inhabitants and the Minister.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="004631_0022_100DB1ED56EE8F48"/> About Ten o'Clock there sprung up a pleasant fair Gale, which carried us from the <HI>Downs</HI> near forty Miles that Day; during which Time I read Prayers, preached to, and catechised my Soldiers, wrote some Letters, and had an Opportunity of send∣ing them as we sailed by <HI>Dover</HI>; for which I was desirous to bless GOD.</P>
<P>Any one must needs think I should have been glad to have heard from Mr. <HI>Wesley,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He came from <HI>Georgia</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> just as Mr.<HI>Whitefield</HI> left it.</NOTE> as he went by <HI>Deal</HI>; out I consider'd GOD ordered all Things for the best; and therefore I now joyfully went, but not knowing whither I went; and doubted not, but He that strengthened <HI>David</HI> when he went out against <HI>Go∣liah,</HI> would also strengthen me against all my spiri∣tual Adversaries, and send his HOLY GHOST to guide, assist, and comfort me in all Emergencies.
<HI>The Good LORD keep me always thus minded!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, Feb.</HI> 3. Let this Day be noted in my Book; for GOD has wrought for us a wonderful De∣liverance! About Seven in the Morning, the Men upon Deck not keeping a good Look out, one of the <HI>East-India</HI> Ships in shifting to the Wind ran near us so very briskly, that had not Capt. <HI>W.</HI> providen∣tially been on Deck, and beseeching them for GOD's sake to tack about, both the Ships must inevitably have split one against another. They were within four Yards of each other. The Captain said he ne∣ver was in so great Danger in his Life. GOD so
<PB N="44" REF="004631_0023_100DB1EFB98FAFF0"/>
ordered it, that Mr. <HI>H.</HI> and I knew nothing of it till it was over: But when I was apprised of it, I endeavoured to excite all to Thankfulness, and re∣turn'd publick Thanks at Prayers. Too many seem'd to be unsensible of the Mercy received. But,</P>
<LG>
<L>Since GOD does thus his wond'rous Love</L>
<L>Thro' all our Lives extend,</L>
<L>Those Lives to him let us devote.</L>
<L>And in his Service spend.</L>
</LG>
<P>Read publick Prayers and preached to the Soldi∣ers as usual; explain'd the <HI>Catechism</HI> to the Women, exhorted them particularly to be obedient to their own Husbands, which they had lately been wanting in: And was pleased to hear the Captain, as I came on Deck, remind me of the Motion I made to him some time ago, about having Prayers daily in the Great Cabbin; and withal desired that from hence∣forward I would read Prayers Morning and Evening to them. This I most readily consented to, it being what I had long desired and prayed for, and what I was just then about to propose to him again. Ac∣cordingly I went immediately and acquainted the Lieutenant, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the Captain's Desire, and we be∣gun this Night to have full publick Prayers: And at the Request of Capt. <HI>W.</HI> I expounded the se∣cond Lesson; and a glorious Lesson it was. <HI>Blessed be GOD! for that I hope we shall now begin to live like Christians, and call upon the Name of the LORD daily.</HI> The very Thoughts of GOD's granting me this Petition filled me with Joy.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="004631_0023_100DB1EFB98FAFF0"/><HI>Saturday, Feb.</HI> 4. Began to have Prayers in the Great Cabbin in the Morning; read Prayers and preached twice to the Soldiers as usual; and ex∣pounded the second Lesson in the Evening to the Gentlemen, after Prayers in the Great Cabbin, which from henceforth I intended, GOD willing, to con∣tinue: Unspeakable I find is and will be the Benefit of it; for it gives me an Opportunity of saying ma∣ny salutary Truths, and affords us Matter for seri∣ous Table-talk afterwards.</P>
<P>Was much pleased to see our Ship sail directly before the Wind; was enlarged in Intercession; fur∣nished three Soldiers with Books, who began to▪day to learn to read: GOD <HI>enable them not only to read, but to do their Duty!</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>H</HI>'s Scholars increase: <HI>The LORD increase his Strength!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, Febr.</HI> 5. Joined in Spirit with absent Friends in holy Ordinances; spent some Time most delightfully in reading the Word of GOD: Read Prayers, and some Observations on both the Lessons in the Great Cabbin; and then read Prayers and ex∣pounded both the Lessons to the Soldiers. <HI>O that the LORD would open our Understandings! for they are but a dead Letter without the Illumination of his Holy Spirit!</HI></P>
<P>Read Prayers and preached my Sermon on <HI>Justi∣fication</HI> in the Afternoon to the Officers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the Great Cabbin.</P>
<P>Begun to-night to turn the Observations made on
<PB N="46" REF="004631_0024_100D85FB4019D160"/>
the Lessons in the Morning into catechistical Ques∣tions, and was pleased to hear some of the Soldiers and my Companions make such apt Answers. I find this an excellent Way of Instruction: It makes them bring their Bible, and give diligent Heed to the Things that are spoken: It teaches them the Scriptures practically, and consequently will by the Divine Blessing make them wise unto Salvation. <HI>Thanks be to GOD for putting this into my Heart! By his Assistance I intend to continue it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, Feb.</HI> 6. Had no Prayers in the Morn∣ing between Decks; but read Prayers in the Cab∣bin, likewise did the same in the Evening, and expounded the 14th Chapter of St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> the second Lesson, which containing an Account of St. <HI>John</HI>'s reproving <HI>Herod,</HI> gave me an Opportunity of telling them, that great Men should not be angry if Ministers should reprove them out of Love; and they seemed to assent to it.</P>
<P>Read Prayers and preached to the Soldiers as usual; interceded warmly for absent Friends and all Mankind; and went to Bed full of Peace and Joy. <HI>Thanks be to GOD for this unspeakable Gift</HI>!</P>
<P>Was pleased to see Mr. <HI>H.</HI> so active in teaching the Children. He has now many Scholars: <HI>May GOD prosper the Works of his Hands upon him</HI>!</P>
<P>Had such pleasant Sailing, that Captain <HI>W.</HI> said he never knew the like before. <HI>What Reason have I to be thankful</HI>! <HI>O that my Friends would help me to give Thanks.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="004631_0024_100D85FB4019D160"/><HI>Tuesday, Feb.</HI> 7. Read Prayers and expounded the Lessons as usual to the Soldiers, and in the great Cabbin; and after Dinner sung Psalms with Mr. <HI>H.</HI> and a Gentleman on board, on open Deck.</P>
<P>Being now in the Bay of <HI>Biscay,</HI> the Ship rock'd very much, tho' there was a great Calm: <HI>But if there's a fixed Principle of Grace, a firm Love of GOD rooted in the Heart; what avails all outward Motions?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wednesday, Feb.</HI> 8. Had publick Worship and expounded as usual to both my Congregations. Was pleased to hear a Gentleman discourse for some Time of the utter Inability of any Thing to make us hap∣py but GOD.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon I preached and read Prayers on open Deck, at the Captain's Desire, who ordered Chairs to be brought, and Boards put across them for the Soldiers to sit upon. My Subject was, <HI>the Eternity of Hell Torments</HI>; and I was earnest in de∣livering of it, being desirous that none of my dear Hearers should experience them. Praying and sing∣ing Psalms on open Deck enlarged my Heart.</P>
<P>Was enabled to make good Part of a Sermon this Evening, and lay down to Sleep. <HI>GOD grant I may die daily!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday, Feb.</HI> 9. Read Prayers, expounded and catechised as usual; had delightful Sailing, and great Joy in the HOLY GHOST, and was very thankful that GOD called me abroad to see and admire his Wonders in the Deep. <HI>O who can serve a better Master than JESUS CHRIST?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="004631_0025_100DB1F52DC7D558"/><HI>Friday, Feb.</HI> 10. Read Prayers, and according to Custom went on in explaining the Catechism to the Women; and after Evening Prayer expounded the 49th Psalm instead of the Lesson. Had still grea∣ter Reason to bless GOD for bringing me to Sea. <HI>O what shall I render unto the LORD?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Feb.</HI> 11. Catechised, visited the Sick, expounded and read Prayers as usual; and met with some Soldiers who could sing by Note, with whom I propose to join in Divine Psalmody every Day.</P>
<LG>
<L>A Psalm may win him who a Sermon flies,</L>
<L>And turn Delight into a Sacrifice.</L>
</LG>
<P>In the Evening gave Thanks for the Blessings, and examined into the Actions of the past Week. <HI>It's well I have a Saviour to satisfy for my Perfor∣mances as well as my Person, for otherwise how should I stand before thee, O Holy LORD GOD? GOD be merciful to me a Sinner.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, Feb.</HI> 12. Did as usual, and preached my Sermon on Glorification to the Gentlemen in the great Cabbin. <HI>Oh that GOD may make us Parta∣kers of it.</HI></P>
<P>Honest <HI>Joseph</HI> my Servant returned Thanks after Morning Prayers for his Recovery from a late se∣vere Fit of Sickness. I hope now CHRIST has touched him, by the Right Hand of his healing Power, he will arise and minister unto him. He tells me he can say with <HI>David, It is good for me that I have been afflicted. GOD be praised! for sanctified Afflictions are Signs of special Love.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="004631_0025_100DB1F52DC7D558"/><HI>Monday, Feb.</HI> 13. Did as usual, only instead of the second Lesson, expounded the 22d Chapter of St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> at the Captain's Request, who takes all Opportunities to express his Kindness to me: <HI>May the GOD whom I serve, sanctify and save him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tuesday Feb.</HI> 14. May I never forget this Day's Mercies, since the LORD was pleased to deal so lo∣vingly with me! About. Twelve at Night a fresh Gale arose, which increased so very much by Four in the Morning, that the Waves raged horribly in∣deed, and broke in like a River on many of the poor Soldiers who lay near the Main Hatch Way. Friend <HI>H.</HI> and I knew nothing of it, but perceived ourselves restless, and could not sleep at all; he complained of a grievous Head-ach. I arose and called upon GOD for myself and those that sailed with me, absent Friends, and all Mankind. After this I went on Deck; but surely a more noble aw∣ful Sight my Eyes never yet beheld! for the Waves rose more than Mountains high; and sometimes came on the Quarter-Deck. I endeavoured all the while to magnify GOD, for thus making his Power to be known: And then creeping on my Knees (for I knew not how to go otherwise) I followed my Friend <HI>H.</HI> between Decks, and sung Psalms and comforted the poor wet People. After this, I read Prayers in the great Cabbin; but we were obliged to sit all the while. Then thinking I should be ca∣pable of doing nothing, I laid myself across the Chair reading; but GOD was so good, so to assist
<PB N="50" REF="004631_0026_100DB1F7500F7340"/>
me by his Spirit, that tho' Things were tumbling, the Ship rocking, and Persons falling down unable to stand, and sick about me; yet I never was more chearful in my Life, and was enabled, though in the midst of Company, to finish a Sermon before I went to Bed, which I had begun a few Days before: So greatly was GOD's Strength magnified in my Weak∣ness! <HI>Praise the LORD, O my Soul, and all that is within me praise his holy. Name!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday, Feb.</HI> 16. Did as usual in the Ship; only instead of Catechising, examined into the Pro∣ficiency of my Friend <HI>H</HI>'s Scholars; gave them proper Encouragement, as I saw they wanted; and had Hopes some of them would become living Mem∣bers of JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>Joined with those at Night, who set apart this Day as a Day of Fasting and Humiliation, to de∣precate the Judgments our National Sins deserve. <HI>LORD, hear our Prayers, and let our Cry come unto thee.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, Feb.</HI> 17. Read Prayers, expounded the Lessons and proceeded on my Explanation of the Catechism to the Women: Expounded part of the <HI>Lord's Prayer,</HI> after Evening Prayer, in the Great Cabbin; and intend, after this is done, to go on with <HI>Creed</HI> and <HI>Ten Commandments. GOD give us all praying, believing, obedient Hearts.</HI></P>
<P>Found honest Mr. <HI>D.</HI> particularly useful to me, I being a little sick by the late shaking of the Ship, and the Heat and Smell of the People between
<PB N="51" REF="004631_0026_100DB1F7500F7340"/>
Decks, who, as yet, have scarce Had Time to reco∣ver themselves since the Storm. <HI>O how soon are these frail Tabernacles of ours put out of Order! Hap∣py the Man who serves GOD in his Health, and has nothing to do when Sickness seizes him but quietly to lye down and die.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Feb.</HI> 18. Performed the usual Duty, and finished the <HI>Lord's Prayer.</HI> Perceived my bo∣dily Disorders to go off, and was enabled to preach to the Soldiers with more Enlargement than I have been for these four Days past. The Captain obser∣ved me a little disordered, and gave Mr. <HI>H.</HI> a Cor∣dial for me: The good LORD note this Favour in his Book.</P>
<P>After Dinner I grew better and better; was ex∣ceedingly delighted by sitting on Deck, praising GOD for the Pleasantness of the Weather, and read∣ing Archbishop <HI>Cranmer</HI>'s Life: <HI>Surely he was a righteous Man.</HI> The Account of his Fall made my Heart tremble within me. <HI>But why shouldest thou be cast down, O my Soul? Still trust in GOD: He that has begun will carry on and finish the good Work. Even so,</HI> LORD JESUS, <HI>come quickly.</HI></P>
<P>Though the Weather was exceeding pleasant all the Day, yet it grew more and more pleasant in the Evening, and our Ship sailed at the Rate of nine Miles an Hour, and as steady as tho' we were sitting on Shore. The Night, was exceeding clear, and the Moon and Stars appeared in their greatest Lustre; so that not having Patience to stay below, I went
<PB N="52" REF="004631_0027_100DB1F96171AD10"/>
upon Deck with Friend <HI>H.</HI> and praised GOD for his wonderful loving Kindness in singing Psalms, and gave Thanks for the Blessings, and asked Par∣don for the Offences of the Week, and then had a long Intercession. <HI>GOD grant I may learn a Lesson from this good Providence of GOD, and the nearer I come to my Journey's End, the quicker may my Pace be.</HI></P>
<P>It is worth coming from <HI>England;</HI> to see what we have beheld this Day. <HI>GOD be praised for all his Mercies.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, Feb.</HI> 19. Slept better to Night than I have a long while; <HI>blessed be the Keeper of</HI> Israel. Read Prayers in the great Cabbin; was enlarged in expounding both the Lessons to the Soldiers; and had Prayers, and preached one of the Sermons GOD enabled me to make since I came on board, on open Deck in the Afternoon, All the Gentlemen at∣tended, Benches were laid for the People, and the Ship sailed smoothly, and the Weather was finer than I can express; so that I know not where I have perform'd the Service more comfortably. And indeed, I have been so delighted these two Days with our pleasant sailing, and the Promontaries all around us, that I could not avoid thanking GOD for calling me abroad, and stirring up all to praise him: <HI>Who by his Strength setteth fast the Mountains, and is girded about with Power.</HI></P>
<P>For these two Days our Ship has sailed at the Rate of a Hundred and sixty Miles in twenty-four
<PB N="53" REF="004631_0027_100DB1F96171AD10"/>
Hours, and rode in Triumph directly before the Wind, and cast Anchor about Two in the Morn∣ing; 'till which Time, I sat up on purpose to give Thanks in <HI>Gibraltar</HI> Haven. <HI>Oh that my Friends would therefore praise the LORD for his Goodness, and extol him for the wonderful Works he hath done for me, the least of the Sons of Men.</HI></P>
<P>How Providence will be pleased to dispose of me here, I cannot yet know; but I thought proper to send you this Account of my short Voyage al∣ready, to shew you how GOD has heard your Pray∣ers, to provoke you to Thankfulness, and to encou∣rage you to persevere in praying on my Behalf. If you observe (as doubtless you may) any thing amiss or imprudent in my Conduct, I beseech you, by the Mercies of GOD in CHRIST JESUS, tell me plain∣ly: for that Cause have I been so particular: And if you should happen to see any Thing com∣mendable or praise-worthy in my Behaviour, Oh, do not think more highly of me than you ought to think; for I am a Worm, and no Man, and deserve to be the Out-cast of the People: but <HI>give all Glory to my best Master, by whose free Grace I am what I am.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot help transcribing the Verses that follow, as a Conclusion to what I have now sent you.</P>

<L>How sure is their Defence!</L>

Think, O my Soul, devoutly think,</L>
<L>How with affrighted Eyes</L>
<L>Thou saw'st the wide extended Deep</L>

<L>Confusion dwelt in ev'ry Face,</L>
<L>And Fear in ev'ry Heart;</L>
<L>When Waves on Waves, and Gulph on Gulph,</L>

<L>Yet then from all my Griefs, O Lord!</L>
<L>Thy Mercy set me free;</L>
<L>Whilst in the Confidence of Prayer,</L>

<L>For tho' in dreadful Whirl's we hung</L>
