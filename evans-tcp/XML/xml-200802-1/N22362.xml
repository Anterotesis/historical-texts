<OPENER><SALUTE>MY BELOVED BRETHREN AND FRIENDS!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the midst of constant and indispensable employment, in the line of my pro∣fession in the University, I have, twelve years, served you in the gospel of our Lord JESUS CHRIST. And, as I have had, during the whole of this time, the most satisfactory evidence of your candor and friendship, it affords me peculiar satisfaction publicly to assure you of my regard and best wishes.</P>
<P>I rejoice in the prospect of your increasing respectability.</P>
<P>Since, probably, it cannot be practicable for me, much longer, to perform the agreeable services, which my present relation, as your pastor and public teacher, requires, it gives relief to my anxiety for your happiness, that you may soon enjoy the labors of a minister, who will be able to devote his time, without interruption, to instruct and edify you.</P>
<P>That GOD may continue to bless you with prosperity in this world; and finally grant you an inheritance among those, who are sanctified, is the sincere desire of your affectionate friend.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>PSALM cxxxiv. 3.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>The LORD, that made heaven and earth bless thee out of Zion</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHITHER shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm cxxx<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x 7.</NOTE></P>
<P>We know, that JEHOVAH is every where present, to hear the prayers of those, who with sincerity and Godly fear invoke his name. He is however more especially present, in the worshipping assemblies of the faithful.</P>
<P>Why is the Lord said to give his blessing out of Zion? because there was his house, where his name was recorded. Of such solemn importance is a house devoted to the pur∣pose of public worship.</P>
<P>When GOD would express his love and kindness to his ancient professing people, he informed them, that he would set his tabernacle in the midst of them. By this he intended, that he would be near them, to hear their petitions, and grant them his blessing.</P>
<P>And, when his people apostatized, and provoked him to manifest his great displeasure, he deprived them of this privilege, which was, indeed, an awful punishment.</P>
<P>To worship and adore the Creator is our reasonable service. To contemplate his perfections, praise his name, and celebrate the wonders of his love to the human kind, are employments grateful to the pious.</P>
<P>The public worship of GOD is our indispensable duty, both with regard to his glory, and our own interest. By this we profess that we are his servants, and that we ought to obey and glorify him.</P>
<P>As we depend upon GOD's blessing for our lives, and all the happiness we either enjoy in this world, or hope for in the future, it is his will, that we implore his favor in places where his name is recorded, and which are con∣secrated to his honor.</P>
<P>Our Savior has promised, that where two or three are
<PB N="7" REF="029528_0005_0FE1D98563D946D0"/>
gathered together in his name, he will grant them his presence.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. xviii. 20.</NOTE> Will he not then (to apply the words of the Psalmist) give a gracious ear to the prayers, which are made "in the great congregation?<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psalm xxii. 25.</NOTE></P>
<P>We should come to GOD's house, to unite with sincere hearts in prayer and praise, and to hear the instructions of his word.</P>
<P>HERE, in the name of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, and with humble reliance on his grace and merits, we should pray our heavenly Father to pardon our sins, which, if not forgiven, will plunge us in everlasting ruin.</P>
<P>We should devoutly implore the quickening and sanc∣tifying influences of his spirit, without which we cannot please GOD, nor be prepared for heaven. Here, we should render thanks to our adorable and merciful Crea∣tor, for those blessings, which we have no reason to expect will be continued, when we are so ungrateful as not to ac∣knowledge them.</P>
<P>"If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting or mildew,—whatsoever sore, or whatsoever sickness there be: then what prayer, or what supplication soever shall be made of any man, or of all thy people Israel, when every one shall know his own sore, and his own grief, and shall spread forth his hands in this place: then hear thou from heaven, thy dwell∣ing place." 2 Chron. vi. 28, 29, 30.</P>
<P>In the following chapter we are informed, "that GOD appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself. Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the prayer that is made in this place.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Verses 12 and 15.</NOTE>"</P>
<P>This is the place, where his ministers are to instruct the ignorant, alarm the careless, and console the contrite in heart.</P>
<P>All, who desire and hope for the blessing of GOD, should, as they have opportunity, wait upon him in pub∣lic worship. And they should behave with decency and reverence, considering they are in the presence of their Creator and final Judge.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="029528_0006_0FE1D98703887AE0"/>
Were we to appear before a chief Magistrate, we should fear to insult him.</P>
<P>On the other hand, we should wish to behave respect∣fully in his presence, and obtain his approbation. Were we to implore his forgiveness of an offence, we should act with humility. Did we request a favor of him, we should address him with submission to his good pleasure. Were we to present him our thanks for a favor received, we should behave so as to appear sensible of our obligation.</P>
<P>GOD requires an outward as well as inward worship. He is displeased with all indecent behavior in so solemn an exercise.</P>
<P>"A son,', says GOD, "honoreth his father, and a ser∣vant his master; if then I be a Father, where is my hon∣or? and if I be a master, where is my fear? And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? Offer it now to thy governor; will he be pleased with thee?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mal i. 6. and 8.</NOTE>"</P>
<P>Thus, the Great GOD is very jealous of his honor, and displeased with such as do not behave with reverence in his worship.</P>
<P>If we trifle, or behave indecently, he is displeased, as a father with the disrespect of a son, or a master with the ill behavior of a servant.</P>
<P>We may also observe, that a decent and reverent beha∣vior, in the public worship of GOD, tends to solemnize the mind, and impress an idea of our obligation to serve and adore him. Thus the priests were commanded to weep between the porch and the altar, that they might be im∣pressed in a manner suitable to the offices they were to per∣form.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Joel ii. 17.</NOTE> Our bodies as well as souls are GOD's; and we are commanded to worship and glorify him with both.</P>
<P>We should, however, remember, that no outward acts are pleasing to GOD, in his worship, any further than they are expressions of holy exercises of heart, or means to impress us with a sense of our dependance upon his grace and kind providence.</P>
<P>In the house of GOD, we should attend, not only to the
<PB N="9" REF="029528_0007_0FE1D9889E9D8640"/>
precepts and instructions contained in his holy word, but also to his wisdom, power, and goodness, displayed in the creation and government of the world.</P>
<P>"The heavens declare the glory of GOD, and the firma∣ment sheweth his handy work. There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm xix. 1. and 3.</NOTE>"</P>
<P>The Great GOD is from everlasting to everlasting. To him pertains every possible perfection. He walks in the circuit of heaven; his eyes run to and fro through∣out the earth. Hell itself is open before him, and des∣truction has no covering. The clouds are his chariots, and the winds his messengers. All the elements fulfil his commands. Darkness is his pavilion. The earth is his footstool; and in the deep waters his wonders are seen.</P>
<P>All nature is his temple, and all space is his abode. Every creature is the workmanship of his hands; and over all his gracious providence extends.</P>
<P>Creation is full of GOD. He has his way in the whirlwind; he sends abroad his lightnings; he gives snow like wool, and scatters the hoarfrost like ashes. If we ascend into heaven, he is there; if we go down into hell, he is also there. In the former reigns his infinite mer∣cy, in the latter his everlasting justice.</P>
<P>Let us, therefore, behave with reverence and godly fear, when in solemn worship, we present ourselves before the omniscient Creator.</P>
<P>Great and important advantages arise from the prac∣tice of public worship, when rightly performed. Were piety and devotion banished from the earth, justice and fidelity would not long remain. Wickedness, could it escape human observation, would prevail and triumph. Were men released from all apprehensions of a supreme Being, to whom they are accountable, oaths would be in∣significant, and confidence amongst men entirely destroy∣ed. In that case, a man could not safely trust a friend; he would every where be in danger of injuries from his fellow creatures. Thus, if the fear of GOD were removed
<PB N="10" REF="029528_0008_0FE1D98A47696A48"/>
from men's minds, human life would be thrown into the greatest confusion, and the bonds of society unhappily dissolved.</P>
<P>By what means can a suitable sense of GOD and his divine providence be so effectually diffused, as by meet∣ing together, and joining in the exercises of public wor∣ship? since society could not subsist without religion, and this could not be maintained without the public worship of GOD, it is incumbent on every friend to man∣kind to encourage it by his influence and example. Such then as habitually absent themselves from public wor∣ship, cannot answer, for the neglect, to GOD, nor their neighbor. And they injure themselves; for sincere and rational worship is both agreeable, and improving to the mind.</P>
<P>Do you wish to become wiser and better? do you de∣sire to obtain the pardon of your sins, through JESUS CHRIST? Would you increase in piety, which is the on∣ly source of peace in life, hope in death, and happiness eternal? "Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of GOD."</P>
<P>Although neither the hearing of GOD's word, nor any means, of themselves, can effect our salvation, yet, while we wilfully neglect them, we harden our hearts in sin, and go far from GOD. The Holy Ghost is the efficient of the new creation; he operates, however, on the minds of men, in the use of means.</P>
<P>To adore our Creator, as the universal Parent, will re∣mind us of our near relation to all mankind, and, thus, strengthen in our breasts the noblest sentiments of hu∣manity. By reflecting on his adorable perfections, if we worship him in spirit and truth, our minds will be im∣pressed with becoming reverence.</P>
<P>If, with true hearts, and in full assurance of faith, we ad∣dress him in prayer, we shall improve in that resig∣nation to his providence, and trust in his power and goodness, which will support and animate us through the changing scenes of life, and afford us consolation, when flesh and heart shall fail.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="029528_0009_0FE1D993555FFC20"/>
Frequently to repeat these exercises will tend to in∣spire us with such a sense of the divine presence and in∣spection, as will, at all times, be a happy guard to our in∣nocence and virtue. Indeed, every part of public wor∣ship is adapted to meliorate the heart, and, consequently, to exalt human nature.</P>
<P>Although we have reason to lament the profaneness and impiety of the present age, yet there are many men of learning and influence, who labor to promote the cause of piety and virtue. Religion has many friends of whom she is not ashamed. These are the wise, the humane, and the virtuous.</P>
<P>Who are her enemies? they are the enemies of man∣kind; the idle and the vicious.</P>
<P>If you engage in the worship of GOD with sincere hearts, in the exercise of faith and love, with your minds free from guilt and superstition,—if you believe in GOD, as the merciful Father of all,—if, with humble dependance on the atonement and intercession of CHRIST, you adore him with pious affections, experience will teach you, that devotion affords the most exalted pleasure.</P>
<P>The human mind is never so much pleased, as when employed in viewing and admiring great and sublime objects. What object is so great and sublime as the eter∣nal GOD? In contemplating him, we are presented with a view of the most perfect glory and excellence.</P>
<P>And do we not experience satisfaction arising from a grateful sense of our obligations to that Almighty and Merciful Being, on whom we ever depend?</P>
<P>Thus to adore our common Parent, the Parent of an∣gels as well as men, the governor of the universe, who will graciously reward his faithful servants, must be a pleasing employment, and afford the most sublime enter∣tainment to pious and generous minds.</P>
<P>Thus exalted are the pleasures of devotion.</P>
<P>Society heightens every rational delight. The melo∣dy of sounds, the fair prospects of nature, and our inter∣course with each other, become more agreeable, when
<PB N="12" REF="029528_0010_0FE1D99516F43C68"/>
the pleasure they afford is communicated from breast to breast.</P>
<P>In like manner, the pleasure of devotion, although highly satisfactory to one, who adores GOD in private, may, however, be increased and more elevated, in a wor∣shipping assembly.</P>
<P>It is the character of an unsocial and sullen spirit to a∣void the places of public worship. A man of true be∣nevolence enjoys peculiar pleasure in such assemblies, in beholding a number of his species engaged in the adora∣tion of their common Creator and Redeemer, and the im∣provement of their minds.</P>
<P>A man of undissembled piety, worshipping with those of the same character, gathers joy from every counte∣nance.</P>
<P>To join, therefore, in public worship with the pious conduces to kindle and enhance our own devotion. If here we experience not a divine satisfaction, we have reason to fear, that our souls are devoid of piety.</P>
<P>I add, that devoutly to worship GOD in the assemblies of his people has a happy tendency to fit us for the em∣ployments and pleasures of the world of glory. When the soul shall forsake its present habitation, the pleasures which depend upon the body will all vanish. The hap∣piness of the heavenly state depends on spiritual entertain∣ments. It consists in the love and exercise of virtue, and in the love, praise, and adoration of the source of felicity. May we, therefore, purifying ourselves from sin, be pre∣pared by devotion, and all the means, which infinite wisdom has appointed, for the exalted state and employ∣ments of the saints in light.</P>
<P><HI>Impressed with these ideas let us attend to our situation.</HI></P>
<P>Twenty five years ago the College was established, and measures were taken to form a settlement, in this part of the town of Hanover. The first settlers were few, and subjected to many inconveniences and difficulties, as this part of the country was an uncultivated wilderness.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="029528_0011_0FE1D996B0568300"/>
The twenty third day of January next will complete the term of twenty five years, since this church was imbodied.</P>
<P>The public worship of GOD has been, without inter∣ruption, attended in this vicinity, from the time of its first settlement.</P>
<P>During the late war, the progress of improvement was greatly retarded. From the conclusion of that war, to the present time, by the blessing of GOD its increase has been considerable.</P>
<P>Although we are not a large society, yet the consider∣ation of public occasions frequently occurring early led the minds of the settlers to view the expediency, that a house for the accommodation of large numbers be spa∣cious and convenient.</P>
<P>This consideration, together with that of the smallness of the number of inhabitants, occasioned the delay of measures for erecting a house for the purpose of public worship, and to be used for those other public purposes, until the last year.</P>
<P>When we consider how few have associated for the de∣sign of building this house, which was begun but a little more than a year ago, and which is now, at their request, and in their behalf, to be dedicated to the worship and honor of GOD, we have reason to acknowledge his good∣ness, in granting success to the undertaking.</P>
<P>As public, social worship is due from mankind to their Creator, it is suitable, that houses erected for this pur∣pose be consecrated to his service. In them he has been pleased to record his name, and to honor them with the appellation of his dwelling places.</P>
<P>Let us, therefore, my beloved brethren and friends, with united hearts, and one accord, beseech the LORD GOD, who gives his blessing out of Zion, to be graciously pleased to accept this our offering, WHICH WE DE∣DICATE TO HIS NAME.</P>
<P>Here, may a divine blessing attend his word, and the administration of his ordinances, to his glory, and the salvation of the souls of multitudes, who may, in this house, hear the joyful sound of the gospel, even glad tid∣ings
<PB N="14" REF="029528_0012_0FE1D9984F87E038"/>
from heaven for sinful men, who will accept of mercy through the Mediator, and, "by patient continu∣ance in well doing, seek for glory, and honor, and im∣mortality."</P>
<P>The LORD, that made heaven and earth, bless you out of Zion.</P>
