<P>As the Editor of this collection is conscious there may ap∣pear some defects in the arrangement of his materials, he thinks it necessary to acquaint the Public with the true rea∣son of their appearing in a less finished state than he could have wished to present them. Some gentlemen of fortune and literary abilities had once conceived the scheme of con∣tributing to the entertainment and instruction of the rising generation by a selection of the most interesting and improv∣ing histories from different authors. They intended to trans∣late from the different languages of Europe whatever might engage the minds of children to the improvement of their knowledge, and inspire them with an early love of virtue. To these they were to have added a judicious selection from natural history, and the most entertaining descriptions that are to be found in the ample collection of modern voyages; together with many original pieces of their own composition. All these it was presumed, would contribute a pleasing and useful miscellany for the use of children, which they intended to have published in periodical numbers. After they had made some progress in the execution of this scheme, they were compelled, by accidents which it is unnecessary to re∣late, to abandon their design. But, though the modesty of the authors would rather have led them to suppress what they could not engage to finish, the Editor, to whom their papers were entrusted, has judged them too valuable to be entirely suppressed. He has, therefore, collected them into a volume, with the hopes that this Miscellany may not ap∣pear undeserving of the public favour, and may be deemed no contemptible addition to that branch of literature which proposes to itself the important object of pleasing and in∣structing children.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF LITTLE JACK.</HEAD>
<P>THERE was once a poor lame old man that lived in the midst of a wide uncultivated moor, in the north of England. He had for∣merly been a soldier, and had almost lost the use of one leg by a wound he had received in battle, when he was fighting against the enemies of his country This poor man, when he found himself thus disabled, built a little hut of clay, which he covered with turf dug from the common. He had a little bit of ground which he made a shift to cultivate with
<PB N="2" REF="030190_0006_0FE504219C18BBD8"/>
his own hands; and which supplied him with potatoes and vegetables; besides this, he some∣times gained a few halfpence by opening a gate for travellers, which stood near his house. He did not indeed get much, because few people passed that way. What he earned was, how∣ever, enough to purchase cloaths, and the few necessaries he wanted. But though poor, he was strictly honest, and never failed night and morning to address his prayers to God; by which means he was respected by all who knew him, much more than many who were superior to him in rank and fortune. This old man had one domestic. In his walks over the com∣mon, he one day found a little kid that had lost its mother, and was almost famished with hunger: he took it home to his cottage, fed it with the produce of his garden, and nursed it till it grew strong and vigorous. Little Nan, (for that was the name he gave it) returned his cares with gratitude, and became as much at∣tached to him as a dog. All day she browzed upon the herbage that grew around his hut, and at night reposed upon the same bed of straw with her master. Frequently did she divert him with her innocent tricks and gambols. She would nestle her little head in his bosom, and eat out of his hand part of his scanty al∣lowance of bread; which he never failed to divide with his favourite. The old man often beheld her with silent joy, and, in the inno∣cent effusions of his heart, would lift his hands to heaven, and thank the Deity, that, even in the midst of poverty and distress, had raised him up one faithful friend.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="030190_0007_0FE503C7E047A048"/>
One night, in the beginning of winter, the old man thought he heard the feeble cries and lamentations of a child. As he was naturally charitable, he arose and struck a light, and, going out of his cottage, examined on every side. It was not long before he discerned an infant, which had probably been dropped by some strolling beggar or gypsy. The old man stood amazed at the sight, and knew not what to do. Shall I, said he, who find it so diffi∣cult to live at present, incumber myself with the care of an helpless infant, that will not for many years be capable of contributing to its own subsistence? And yet, added he, softening with pity, can I deny assistance to an human being still more miserable than myself?—Will not that Providence which feeds the birds of the wood and the beasts of the field, and which has promised to bless all those that are kind and charitable, assist my feeble endeavours?—At least, let me give it food and lodging for this night; for without I receive it into my cot∣tage, the poor abandoned wretch must perish with cold before the morning. Saying this, he took it up in his arms, and perceived it was a fine healthy boy, though covered with rags; the little foundling too seemed to be sensible of his kindness, and smiling in his face, stretch∣ed out his little arms, as if to embrace his benefactor.</P>
<P>When he had brought it into his hut, he began to be extremely embarrassed how to pro∣cure it food: but looking at Nan, he recol∣lected that she had just lost her kid, and saw her udder distended with milk: he, therefore,
<PB N="4" REF="030190_0008_0FE50423260D8FD8"/>
called her to him, and, presenting the child to the teat, was overjoyed to find, that it sucked as naturally as if it had really found a mother. The goat too seemed to receive pleasure from the efforts of the child, and submitted without opposition to discharge the duties of a nurse. Contented with this experiment, the old man wrapped the child up as warmly as he could, and stretched himself out to rest with the con∣sciousness of having done an humane action. Early the next morning he was awakened by the cries of the child for food, which with the assistance of his faithful Nan, he suckled as he had done the night before. And now the old man began to feel an interest in the child, which made him defer some time longer the taking measures to be delivered from its care. Who knows, said he, but Providence which has pre∣served this child in so wonderful a manner, may have destined it to something equally won∣derful in his future life; and may bless me as the humble agent of his decrees? At least, as he grows bigger, he will be a pleasure and comfort to me, in this lonely cabin, and will assist in cutting turf for fuel, and cultivating the gar∣den. From this time he became more and more attached to the little foundling; who, in a short time, learned to consider the old man as a pa∣rent, and delighted him with its innocent ca∣resses. Gentle Nanny too, the goat, seemed to adopt him with equal tenderness as her off∣spring: she would stretch herself out upon the ground, while he crawled upon his hands and knees towards her; and when he had satisfied
<PB N="5" REF="030190_0009_0FE503C9C8E89FD8"/>
his hunger by sucking, he would nestle between her legs and go to sleep in her bosom.</P>
<P>It was wonderful to see how this child, thus left to nature, increased in strength and vigour. Unfettered by bandages or restraints, his limbs acquired their due proportions and form; his countenance was full and florid, and gave indi∣cations of perfect health; and, at an age when other children are scarcely able to support them∣selves with the assistance of a nurse, this little foundling could run alone. It was true, that he sometimes failed in his attempts, and fell to the ground; but the ground was soft, and little Jack, for so the old man called him, was not tender or delicate; he never minded thumps or bruises, but boldly scrambled up again and pur∣sued his way. In a short time, little Jack was completely master of his legs; and as the sum∣mer came on, he attended his mamma, the
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="6" REF="030190_0010_0FE50426E52DEDD8"/>
goat, upon the common, and used to play with her for hours together; sometimes rolling under her belly, now climbing upon her back, and frisking about as if he had really been a kid. As to his cloathing, Jack was not much incum∣bered with it; he had neither shoes, nor stock∣ings, nor shirt; but the weather was warm, and Jack felt himself so much lighter for every kind of exercise. In a short time after this, Jack began to imitate the sounds of his papa the man, and his mamma the goat; nor was it long before he learned to speak articulately. The old man delighted with this first dawn of reason, used to place him upon his knee, and converse with him for hours together, while his pottage was slowly boiling amid the embers of a turf fire. As he grew bigger, Jack became of consider∣able use to his father; he could trust him to look after the gate, and open it during his ab∣sence: and, as to the cookery of the family, it was not long before Jack was a complete pro∣ficient, and could make broth almost as well as his daddy himself. During the winter nights, the old man used to entertain him with stories of what he had seen during his youth; the battles and sieges he had been witness to, and the hardships he had undergone; all this he related with so much vivacity that Jack was never tired of listening. But what delighted him beyond measure was to see daddy shoulder his crutch, instead of a musket, and give the word of command. To the right—to the left—present—sire—march—halt—all this was familiar to Jack's ear as soon as he could speak, and before he was six years old, he poized and
<PB N="7" REF="030190_0011_0FE503CC86E26BB0"/>
presented a broom-stick, which his daddy gave him for that purpose, with as good a grace as any soldier of his age in Europe.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>The old man too instructed him in such plain and simple morals and religion, as he was able to explain. "Never tell an untruth, Jack, said he, even though you were to be flayed alive; a soldier never lies." Jack held up his head, marched across the floor, and promised his daddy that he would always tell the truth like a soldier. But the old man, as he was something of a scholar, had a great ambition that his darling should learn to read, and write; and this was a work of some diffi∣culty; for he had neither printed book, nor pens, nor paper in his cabin. Industry, how∣ever, enables us to overcome difficulties; in the summer time, as the old man sat before his cot∣tage, he would draw letters in the sand, and
<PB N="8" REF="030190_0012_0FE50430504A6130"/>
teach Jack to name them singly, until he was acquainted with the whole alphabet, he then proceeded to syllables; and after that to words; all which his little pupil learned to pronounce with great facility: and, as he had a strong propensity to imitate what he saw, he not only acquired the power of reading words, cut of tracing all the letters which composed them, on the sand.</P>
<P>About this time, the poor goat which had nursed Jack so faithfully, grew ill and died. He tended her with the greatest affection and assiduity during her illness, brought her the freshest herbs for food, and would frequently support her head for hours together upon his little bosom. But it was all in vain; he lost his poor mammy, as he used to call her, and was for some time inconsolable; for Jack, though his knowledge was bounded, had an uncommon degree of gratitude and affection in his temper. He was not able to talk as finely about love, tenderness, and sensibility, as many other little boys, that have enjoyed greater ad∣vantages of education; but he felt the reality of them in his heart, and thought it so natural to love every thing that loves us, that he never even suspected it was possible to do otherwise. The poor goat was buried in the old man's garden, and thither little Jack would often come and call upon his poor mammy Nan, and ask her why she had left him? One day, as he was thus employed, a lady happened to come by in a carriage, and overheard him before he was aware. Jack ran in an instant to open the
<PB N="9" REF="030190_0013_0FE503D5728AB498"/>
gate; but the lady stopped, and asked him whom he was bemoaning so pitifully, and calling
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
upon? Jack answered, that it was his poor mammy, that was buried in the garden. The lady thought it very odd to hear of such a bu∣rial place, and therefore proceeded to question him, "How did your mammy get her living?" said she. "She used to graze here upon the common all day long," said Jack. The lady was still more astonished; but the old man came out of his hut, and explained the whole affair to her, which surprised her very much; for though this lady had seen a great deal of the world, and had read a variety of books, it had ne∣ver once entered into her head that a child might grow strong and vigorous by sucking a goat, instead of eating pap. She therefore looked at Jack with amazement, admired his brown but animated face, and praised his shape and acti∣vity.
<PB N="10" REF="030190_0014_0FE504324D70A0C8"/>
"Will you go with me, little boy, said she, and I will take care of you, if you behave well?" "No, said Jack, I must stay with daddy; he has taken care of me for many years, and now I must take care of him; otherwise I should like very well to go with such a sweet, good-natured lady." The lady was not displeased with Jack's answer, and putting her hand in her pocket, gave him half a crown, to buy him shoes and stockings, and pursued her jour∣ney.</P>
<P>Jack was not unacquainted with the use of money, as he had been often sent to the next village to purchase bread and necessaries; but he was totally unacquainted with the use of shoes and stockings, which he had never worn in his life, or felt the want of. The next day, however, the old man bade him run to town, and lay his money out as the lady had desired; for he had too much honour to think of disobeying her commands, or suffering it to be expended for any other purpose. It was not long before Jack returned; but the old man was much sur∣prised to see him come back as bare as he went out. "Heigh, Jack! said he, where are the shoes and stockings which you were to pur∣chase?" "Daddy, answered Jack, I went to the shop, and just tried a pair for sport, but I found them so cumbersome, that I could not walk, and I would not wear such things, even if the lady would give me another half crown for doing it; so I laid the money out in a warm jacket for you, because the winter is coming on, and you seem to be more afraid of the cold than formerly." Many such instances
<PB N="11" REF="030190_0015_0FE503D738460D38"/>
of conduct did Jack display; from which it was easy to perceive, that he had an excellent soul, and generous temper. One failing, in∣deed Jack was liable to; though a very good natured boy, he was a little too jealous of his honour. His daddy had taught him the use of his hands and legs, and Jack had such disposi∣tions for the art of boxing, that he could beat every boy in the neighbourhood, of his age and size. Even if they were a head taller, it made no difference to Jack, provided they said any thing to wound his honour; for otherwise he was the most mild, pacific creature in the world. One day that he had been sent to the village, he returned with his eyes black, and his face swelled to a frightful size: it was even with difficulty that he was able to walk at all, so sore was he with the pomelling he had receiv∣ed. "What have you been doing now, Jack?" said the old man.—"Only fighting with Dick the butcher." "You rogue, said the old man, he is twice as big as you are, and the best fighter in all the country." "What does that signify, said Jack, he called you an old beggarman, and then I struck him; and I will strike him again whenever he calls you so, even if he should beat me to pieces; for you know, daddy, that you are not a beggarman, but a soldier."</P>
<P>In this manner lived little Jack, until he was twelve years old; at this time his poor old daddy fell sick and became incapable of moving about. Jack did every thing he could think of for the poor man; he made him broths, he fed him with his own hands, he watched whole nights by his bed-side supporting his head and helping
<PB N="12" REF="030190_0016_0FE50433D6DF3D68"/>
him when he wanted to move. But it was all in vain; his poor daddy grew daily worse, and perceived it to be impossible that he should re∣cover. He one day therefore called little Jack to his bed-side, and pressing his hand affection∣ately, told him that he was just going to die. Little Jack burst into a flood of tears at this information, but his daddy desired him to compose himself, and attend to the last advice
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
he should be able to give him. "I have lived, said the old man, a great many years, in po∣verty, but I do not know that I have been worse off than if I had been rich. I have avoided, perhaps, many faults, and many uneasinesses, which I should have incurred had I been in another situation; and though I have often wanted a meal and always sared hard, I have enjoyed as much health and life as usually falls to the lot of my betters. I am now going to
<PB N="13" REF="030190_0017_0FE503BB354928B8"/>
die; I feel it in every part; the breath will soon be out of my body; then I shall be put in the ground, and the worms will eat your poor old daddy." At this Jack renewed his tears and sobbings, for he was unable to restrain them. But the old man said; "Have patience, my child; though I should leave this world, as I have always been strictly honest and endea∣voured to do my duty, I do not doubt but God will pity me, and convey me to a better place; where I shall be happier than I have ever been here. This is what I have always taught you, and this belief gives me the greatest comfort in my last moments. The only regret I feel, is for you, my dearest child, whom I leave unprovi∣ded for. But you are strong and vigorous, and almost able to get your living. As soon as I am dead, you must go to the next village and inform the people, that they may come and bury me. You must then endeavour to get into service, and work for your living; and, if you are strictly honest and sober, I do not doubt that you will find a livelihood, and that God, who is the common father of all, will protect and bless you. Adieu, my child, I grow faint∣er and fainter; never forget your poor old daddy, nor the example he has set you; but in every situation of life discharge your duty, and live like a Soldier, and a Christian." When the old man had with difficulty uttered these last instructions, his voice entirely failed him, his limbs grew cold and stiff, and in a few mi∣nutes he expired without a groan. Little Jack, who hung crying over his daddy, called upon him in vain, in vain endeavoured to revive
<PB N="14" REF="030190_0018_0FE5043570FCC198"/>
him. At length he pulled off his cloaths, went into his daddy's bed, and endeavoured for many hours to animate him with the warmth of his own body; but finding all his endeavours fruit∣less, he concluded that he was indeed dead; and therefore, weeping bitterly, he drest him∣self, and went to the village as he had been or∣dered. The poor little boy was thus left en∣tirely destitute and knew not what to do; but one of the farmers, who had been acquainted with him before, offered to take him into his house, and give him his victuals, for a few months, till he could find a service. Jack thankfully accepted the offer, and served him faithfully for several months; during which time he learned to milk, to drive the plough, and never refused any kind of work he was able to perform. But, by ill luck, this good-natu∣red farmer contracted a fever, by over-heating himself in the harvest, and died in the begin∣ning of winter. His wife was therefore obliged to discharge her servants, and Jack was again turned loose upon the world, with only his cloaths, and a shilling in his pocket, which his kind mistress had made him a present of. He was very sorry for the loss of his master; but he was now grown bigger and stronger, and thought he should easily find employment. He therefore set out upon his travels, walking all day, and inquiring at every farm-house for work. But in this attempt he was unfortu∣nate, for nobody chose to employ a stranger: and though he lived with the greatest econo∣my, he soon found himself in a worse situation than ever, without a farthing in his pocket, or
<PB N="15" REF="030190_0019_0FE503D8CF654CA8"/>
a morsel of bread to eat. Jack, however, was not of a temper to be easily cast down; he walk∣ed resolutely on all day, but towards evening was overtaken by a violent storm of rain, which wetted him to the skin before he could find a bush for shelter. Now, poor Jack began to think of his old daddy, and the comforts he had formerly enjoyed upon the common, where he had always a roof to shelter him, and a slice of bread for supper. But tears and lamenta∣tions were vain; and therefore, as soon as the storm was over, he pursued his journey, in hopes of finding some barn or out-house to creep into for the rest of the night. While he was thus wandering about, he saw at some dis∣tance a great light, which seemed to come from some prodigious fire. Jack did not know what this could be; but, in his present situa∣tion, he thought a fire no disagreeable object, and therefore determined to approach it. When he came nearer, he saw a large build∣ing which seemed to spout fire and smoke at several openings, and heard an incessant noise of blows, and the rattling of chains. Jack was at first a little frightened, but summoning all his courage, he crept cautiously on to the building, and looking through a chink, disco∣vered several men and boys employed in blow∣ing fires and hammering burning masses of iron. This was a very comfortable sight to him in his present forlorn condition; so finding a door half open, he ventured in, and placed himself as near as he dared to one of the flaming fur∣naces. It was not long before he was disco∣vered by one of the workmen, who asked him,
<FIGURE>
<PB N="16" REF="030190_0020_0FE50440EBAD51F8"/>
</FIGURE>
roughly, what business he had there? Jack an∣swered with great humility, that he was a poor boy, looking out for work; that he had had no food all day, and was wet to the skin with the rain, which was evident enough from the appearance of his cloaths. By great good luck, the man he spoke to was good-natured, and therefore not only permitted him to stay by the fire, but gave him some broken victuals for his supper. After this, he laid himself down in a corner, and slept without disturbance till morning. He was scarcely awake the next day, when the master of the forge came in to overlook his men, who finding Jack, and hear∣ing his story, began to reproach him as a lazy vagabond, and asked him why he did not work for his living. Jack assured him there was nothing he so earnestly desired, and that if he would please to employ him, there was nothing
<PB N="17" REF="030190_0021_0FE503DBA3B1BDB8"/>
that he would not do to earn a subsistence. Well, my boy, said the master, if this is true, you shall soon be tried; nobody need be idle here; so calling his foreman, he ordered him to set that lad to work, and pay him in pro∣portion to his deserts. Jack now thought him∣self completely happy, and worked with so much assiduity, that he soon gained a com∣fortable livelihood, and acquired the esteem of his master. But unfortunately, he was a little too unreserved in his conversation, and com∣municated the story of his former life and edu∣cation. This was great matter of diversion to all the other boys of the forge; who, when∣ever they were inclined to be merry, would call him little Jack the beggar-boy, and imi∣tate the baaing of a goat. This was too much for his irascible temper, and he never failed to resent it; by which means he was engaged in continual quarrels and combats, to the great disturbance of the house; so that his master, though in other respects perfectly satisfied with his behaviour, began to fear that he should at last be obliged to discharge him.</P>
<P>It happened one day, that a large company of gentlemen and ladies were introduced to see the works. The master attended them, and explained, with great politeness, every part of his manufacture. They viewed with astonish∣ment the different methods by which that use∣ful and necessary ore of iron is rendered sit for human use. They examined the furnaces where it is melted down, to disengage it from the dross, with which it is mixed in the bowels of the earth, and whence it runs down in liquid
<FIGURE>
<PB N="18" REF="030190_0022_0FE50442EBD14518"/>
</FIGURE>
torrents like fire. They beheld with equal plea∣sure the prodigious hammers which, moved by the force of water, mould it into massy bars, for the service of man. While they were busy in examining these different processes, they were alarmed by a sudden noise of discord, which broke out on the other side of the build∣ing; and the master inquiring into the cause, was told, that it was only little Jack, who was fighting with Tom the collier. At this, the master cried out, in a passion, there is no peace to be expected in the furnace, while that little rascal is employed; send him to me, and I will instantly discharge him. At this moment Jack appeared, all covered with blood and dirt, and stood before his angry judge in a modest, but resolute posture. "Is this the reward, said his master, you little audacious vagabond, of all my kindness? Can you never refrain a single in∣stant
<FIGURE>
<PB N="19" REF="030190_0023_0FE503E350B8A7A8"/>
</FIGURE>
from broils and fighting? But I am deter∣mined to bear it no longer; and therefore you shall never, from this hour, do a single stroke of work for me." "Sir, replied Jack, with great humility, but yet with firmness, I am extremely sorry to have disobliged you, nor have I ever done it willingly, since I have been here; and if the other boys would only mind their business as well as I do, and not molest me, you would not have been offended now; for I defy them all to say, that since I have been in the house, I have ever given any one the least provocation, or ever refused to the utmost of my strength, to do whatever I have been ordered." "That's true, in good faith, said the foreman; I must do little Jack the justice to say that there is not a more honest, sober, and industrious lad about the place. Set him to what you will, he never sculks, never grumbles, never slights his work;
<PB N="20" REF="030190_0024_0FE50444740B6128"/>
and if it were not for a little passion and fight∣ing, I don't believe there would be his fellow in England." "Well, said the master a little molli∣fied, but what is the cause of all this sudden dis∣turbance?" "Sir, answered Jack, it is Tom that has been abusing me and telling me that my fa∣ther was a beggarman and my mother a nanny-goat; and when I desired him to be quiet, he went baaing all about the house; and this I could not bear; for as to my poor father he was an honest soldier, and if I did suck a goat, she was the best creature in the world, and I won't hear her abused while I have any strength in my body." At this harangue, the whole audience were scarcely able to refrain from laughing, and the master, with more composure, told Jack to mind his business, and threatened the other boys with punishment, if they disturbed him.</P>
<P>But a lady who was in company seemed par∣ticularly interested about little Jack, and when she had heard his story, said, this must certainly be the little boy who opened a gate several years past for me upon Norcot Moor. I remember being struck with his appearance, and hearing him lament the loss of the goat that nursed him. I was very much affected with his his∣tory, and since he deserves so good a character, if you will part with him, I will instantly take him into my service. The master replied, that he should part with him with great satisfaction to such an excellent mistress; that indeed the boy deserved all the commendations which had been given; but since the other lads had such an habit of plaguing, and Jack was of so impa∣tient a temper, he despaired of ever composing
<PB N="21" REF="030190_0025_0FE503E617AB5B50"/>
their animosities. Jack was then called, and informed of the lady's offer, which he instantly accepted with the greatest readiness, and re∣ceived immediate directions to her house.</P>
<P>Jack was now in a new sphere of life. His face was washed, his hair combed, he was clo∣thed afresh, and appeared a very smart active lad. His business was, to help in the stable, to water the horses, to clean shoes, to perform errands, and to do all the jobs of the family; and in the discharge of these services, he soon gave universal satisfaction. He was indefati∣gable in doing what he was ordered, never grum∣bled, or appeared out of temper, and seemed so quiet and inoffensive in his manners, that every body wondered how he had acquired the cha∣racter of being quarrelsome. In a short time, he became both the favourite and the drudge of the whole family; for, speak but kindly to him and call him a little soldier, and Jack was at every one's disposal. This was Jack's par∣ticular foible and vanity; at his leisure hours, he would divert himself by the hour together, in poizing a dung fork, charging with a broom stick, and standing centry at the stable door. Another propensity of Jack's, which now dis∣covered itself, was an immoderate love of horses. The instant he was introduced into the stable, he attached himself so strongly to these animals, that you would have taken him for one of the same species, or at least a near rela∣tion. Jack was never tired with rubbing down and currying them; the coachman had scarcely any business but to sit upon his box; all the operations of the stable were intrusted to little
<PB N="22" REF="030190_0026_0FE504470C7AE688"/>
Jack, nor was it ever known that he neglected a single particular. But what gave him more pleasure than all the rest, was sometimes to ac∣company his mistress upon a little horse, which he managed with infinite dexterity.</P>
<P>Jack too discovered a great disposition for all the useful and mechanic arts. He had served an apprenticeship already to the manufactory of iron, and of this he was almost as vain as being a soldier. As he began to extend his know∣ledge of the world, he saw that nothing could be done without iron. How would you plough the ground, said Jack; how would you dig your garden; how would you even light a fire, dress a dinner, shoe a horse, or do the least thing in the world, if we workmen at the forge did not take the trouble of preparing it for you? Thus Jack would sometimes expatiate upon the dignity and importance of his own profession, to the great admiration of all the other ser∣vants.</P>
<P>These ideas naturally gave Jack a great esteem for the profession of a blacksmith, and in his occasional visits to the forge with the horses, he learnt to make and fix a shoe as neatly as any artist in the country.</P>
<P>Nor were Jack's talents confined to the ma∣nufactory of iron; his love of horses was so great, and his interest in every thing that rela∣ted to them, that it was not long before he acquired a very competent knowledge in the art of saddlery.</P>
<P>Jack would also sometimes observe the car∣penters when they were at work, and sometimes by stealth attempt the management of their
<FIGURE>
<PB N="23" REF="030190_0027_0FE503E7A0FFD0A0"/>
</FIGURE>
tools; in which he succeeded as well as in every thing else; so that he was looked upon by every body as a very active, ingenious boy.</P>
<P>There was in the family, where he now lived, a young gentleman, the nephew of his mistress, who had lost his parents, and was therefore brought up by his aunt. As Master Willets was something younger than Jack, and a very good-natured boy, he soon began to take notice of him, and be much diverted with his com∣pany. Jack, indeed, was not undeserving this attention; for although he could not boast any great advantages of education, his conduct was entirely free from all the vices to which some of the lower class of people are subject. Jack was never heard to swear, or express himself with any indecency. He was civil and respect∣ful in his manners to all his superiors, and uni∣formly good-natured to his equals. In respect
<PB N="24" REF="030190_0028_0FE5045321639F68"/>
to the animals entrusted to his care, he not only refrained from using them ill, but was never tired with doing them good offices. Add∣ed to this, he was sober, temperate, hardy, active, and ingenious, and despised a lie as much as any of his betters. Master Willets now began to be much pleased with playing at cric∣ket and trap-ball with Jack, who excelled at both these games. Master Willets had a little horse which Jack looked after; and not con∣tented with looking after him in the best man∣ner, he used to ride him at his leisure hours with so much care and address, that in a short time he made him the most gentle and docile little animal in the country. Jack had acquired this knowledge partly from his own experience, and partly from paying particular attention to an itinerant riding-master that had lately ex∣hibited various feats in that neighbourhood. Jack attended him so closely, and made so good
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="25" REF="030190_0029_0FE503EA53817C08"/>
an use of his time, that he learned to imitate almost every thing he saw, and used to divert the servants and his young master with acting the tailor's riding to Brentford.</P>
<P>The young gentleman had a master who used to come three times a week to teach him ac∣counts, and writing, and geography. Jack used to be sometimes in the room while the lessons were given, and listened according to custom with so much attention to all that pass∣ed, that he received very considerable advan∣tage for his own improvement. He had now a little money, and he laid some of it out to pur∣chase pens and paper and a slate, with which at night he used to imitate every thing he had heard and seen in the day: and his little mas∣ter, who began to love him very sincerely, when he saw him so desirous of improvement, con∣trived, under one pretence or another, to have him generally in the room while he was receiv∣ing instruction himself.</P>
<P>In this manner Jack went on for some years, leading a life very agreeable to himself, and discharging his duty very much to the satisfac∣tion of his mistress. An unlucky accident at length happened to interrupt his tranquility. A young gentleman came down to visit Master. Willets, who, having been educated in France, and among genteel people in London, had a very great taste for finery, and a supreme con∣tempt for all the vulgar. His dress too was a little particular, as well as his manners; for he spent half his time in adjusting his head, wore a large black bag tied to his hair behind, and would sometimes strut about for half an hour together
<PB N="26" REF="030190_0030_0FE50454B929CDE8"/>
with his hat under his arm, and a little sword
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
by his side. This young man had a supreme contempt for all the vulgar, which he did not attempt to conceal; and when he had heard the story of Jack's birth and education, he could scarcely bear to be in the same room with him. Jack soon perceived the aversion which the stranger entertained for him, and at first endea∣voured to remove it, by every civility in his power; but when he found that he gained no∣thing by all his humility, his temper, natu∣rally haughty, took fire, and, as far as he dared, he plainly showed all the resentment he felt.</P>
<P>It happened one day, after Jack had receiv∣ed some very mortifying usage from this young gentleman, that as he was walking along the road, he met with a showman, who was return∣ing from a neighbouring fair with some wild
<PB N="27" REF="030190_0031_0FE503EF76BB8538"/>
beasts in a cart. Among the rest was a mid∣dle sized monkey, who was not under cover like the rest, and played so many antic tricks, and made so many grimaces, as engaged all Jack's attention, and delighted him very much, for he always had a propensity for every species of drollery. After a variety of questions and conversation, the showman, who probably wanted to be rid of his monkey, proposed to Jack to purchase him for half a crown. Jack could not resist the temptation of being master of such a droll diverting animal, and therefore agreed to the bargain. But when he was left alone with his purchase, whom he led along by a chain, he soon began to repent his haste, and knew not how to dispose of him. As there was however, no remedy, Jack brought him carefully home, and confined him safe in an out-house, which was not applied to any use. In this situation he kept him several days, with∣out accident, and frequently visited him at his leisure hours, with apples, nuts, and such other presents as he could procure. Among the other tricks which the monkey had been taught to perform, he would rise upon his hind legs at the word of command, and bow with the great∣est politeness to the company. Jack, who had found out these accomplishments in his friend, could not resist the impulse of making them subservient to his resentment. He, therefore, one day, procured some flour, with which he powdered his monkey's head, fixed a large paper bag to his neck, put an old hat under his arm, and tied a large iron skewer to his side, instead of a sword; and thus accoutred led him about
<PB N="28" REF="030190_0032_0FE50456684599D0"/>
with infinite satisfaction, calling him Monsieur, and jabbering such broken French as he had picked up from the conversation of the visitor. It happened very unluckily at this very instant, that the young gentleman himself passed by, and instantly saw at one glance the intended copy of himself, and all the malice of little Jack; who was leading him along, and calling
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
to him to hold up his head and look like a per∣son of fashion. Rage instantly took possession of his mind, and drawing his sword, which he happened to have on, he ran the poor monkey through with a sudden thrust, and laid him dead upon the ground. What more he might have done is uncertain, for Jack, who was not of a temper to see calmly such an outrage com∣mitted upon an animal whom he considered as his friend, flew upon him like a fury, and wresting the sword out of his hand, broke it
<PB N="29" REF="030190_0033_0FE503F2519A60D0"/>
into twenty pieces. The young gentleman himself received a fall in the scuffle, which, though it did him no material damage, daubed all his cloaths, and totally spoiled the whole
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
arrangement of his dress. At this instant, the lady herself, who had heard the noise, came down, and the violence of poor Jack was too apparent to be excused. Jack, indeed, was sub∣missive to his mistress, whom he was very sorry to have offended; but, when he was ordered to make concessions to the young gentleman, as the only conditions upon which he could be kept in the family, he absolutely refused. He owned, indeed, that he was much to blame for resenting the provocations he had received, and endeavouring to make his mistress's company ridiculous; but as to what he had done in de∣fence of his friend the monkey, there were no possible arguments which could convince him
<PB N="30" REF="030190_0034_0FE504580EE8A680"/>
he was in the least to blame; nor would he have made submissions to the king himself. This unfortunate obstinacy of Jack's was the occasion of his being discharged, very much to the regret of the lady herself, and still more to that of Master Willets. Jack therefore packed up his cloaths in a little bundle, shook all his fellow-servants by the hand, took an affection∣ate leave of his kind master, and once more sallied out upon his travels.</P>
<P><FIGURE>

<P>He had not walked far before he came to a town, where a party of soldiers were beating up for volunteers. Jack mingled with the crowd that surrounded the recruiting serjeant, and listened with great pleasure to the sound of the fifes and drums; nor could he help mecha∣nically holding up his head, and stepping for∣ward with an air that showed the trade was not entirely new to him. The serjeant soon took
<PB N="31" REF="030190_0035_0FE503F3DC5ECD58"/>
notice of these gestures, and seeing him a strong likely lad, came up to him, clapped him upon the back, and asked him if he would enlist? "You are a brave boy, said he, I can see it in
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
your looks—come along with us, and I don't doubt in a few weeks, you'll be as complete a soldier as those who have been in the army for years." Jack made no answer to this, but by instantly poizing his stick, cocking his hat fiercely, and going through the whole manuel exercise.—"Prodigious, indeed, cried the ser∣jeant, I see you have been in the army already, and can eat fire as well as any of us. But come with us, my brave lad, you shall live well, have little to do, but now and then fight for your king and country, as every gentleman ought; and in a short time, I don't doubt but I shall see you a captain, or some great man, rolling in wealth, which you have got out of
<PB N="32" REF="030190_0036_0FE50461A6DD62F8"/>
the spoils of your enemies."—"No, said Jack, captain, that will never do—no tricks upon travellers—I know better what I have to expect if I enlist—I must lie hard, live hard, expose my life and limbs, every hour of the day, and be soundly cudgelled every now and then into the bargain."—"O'ons, cried the serjeant, where did the young dog pick up all this? He is enough to make a whole company desert."—"No, said Jack, they shall never desert through me; for though I know this, as I am at present out of employment, and have a great respect for the character of a gentleman soldier, I will enlist directly in your regiment." "A brave fellow, indeed, said the serjeant; here, my boy, here is your money and your cockade, both which he directly presented, for fear his recruit should change his mind; and thus in a moment little Jack became a soldier.</P>
<P>He had scarcely time to feel himself easy in his new accoutrements, before he was embark∣ed for India in the character of a marine. This kind of life was entirely new to Jack; however, his usual activity and spirit of observa∣tion did not desert him here, and he had not been embarked many weeks, before he was perfectly acquainted with all the duty of a sailor, and in that respect equal to most on board. It happened that the ship, in which he sailed, touched at the Cormo Islands, in order to take in wood and water; these are some little islands near the coast of Africa, inhabited by blacks. Jack often went on shore with the officers, attending them on their shooting parties to carry their powder and shot, and the game they killed.
<FIGURE>
<PB N="33" REF="030190_0037_0FE503F6D1E50630"/>
</FIGURE>
All this country consists of very lofty hills, co∣vered with trees and shrubs of various kinds, which never lose their leaves, from the perpe∣tual warmth of the climate. Through these it is frequently difficult to force a way, and the hills themselves abound in precipices. It hap∣pened that one of the officers whom Jack was attending upon a shooting party, took aim at some great bird and brought it down; but as it fell into some deep valley, over some rocks which it was impossible to descend, they despair∣ed of gaining their prey. Jack, immediately, with officious haste, set off and ran down the more level side of the hill, thinking to make a circuit and reach the valley into which the bird had fallen. He set off, therefore, but as he was totally ignorant of the country, he, in a short time, buried himself so deep in the wood, which grew continually thicker, that he knew
<PB N="34" REF="030190_0038_0FE504643189E280"/>
not which way to proceed. He then thought it most prudent to return; but this he found as difficult to effect as the other. He therefore wandered about the woods with inconceivable difficulty all day, but could never find his com∣pany nor even reach the shore, or obtain the prospect of the sea. At length the night ap∣proached, and Jack, who perceived it to be impossible to do that in the dark, which he had not been able to effect in the light, lay down under a rock, and composed himself to rest, as well as he was able. The next day he rose with the light, and once more attempted to regain the shore: but unfortunately he had totally lost all idea of the direction he ought to pursue, and saw nothing around him but the dismal prospect of woods and hills and preci∣pices, without a guide or path. Jack now began to be very hungry, but as he had a fowling piece with him, and powder and shot, he soon
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="35" REF="030190_0039_0FE503FDCE284868"/>
procured himself a dinner; and kindling a fire with some dry leaves and sticks, he roasted his game upon the embers, and dined as com∣fortably as he could be expected to do in so forlorn a situation. Finding himself much refreshed, he pursued his journey, but with as little success as ever. On the third day, he indeed came in sight of the sea, but found that he was quite on a different side of the island from that where he left the ship, and that neither ship nor boat was to be seen. Jack now lost all hopes of rejoining his comrades, for he knew the ship was to sail at farthest upon the third day, and would not wait for him. He, therefore, sat down very pensively upon a rock, and cast his eyes upon the vast extent of ocean which was stretched out before him. He found himself now abandoned upon a strange country, without a single friend, ac∣quaintance, or even any one who spoke the same language. He at first thought of seeking out the natives, and making known to them his deplorable state; but he began to fear the reception he might meet with among them. They might not be pleased, he thought, with his company, and might take the liberty of treating him as the white men generally treat the blacks when they get them into their pos∣session; that is, make him work hard with very little victuals, and knock him on the head if he attempted to run away. And therefore, says Jack, as he was meditating all alone, it may, perhaps, be better for me to stay quiet where I am. It is true, indeed, I shall not have much company to talk to, but then I shall
<PB N="36" REF="030190_0040_0FE50465BB9904E0"/>
have nobody to quarrel with me, or baa, or laugh at my poor daddy and mammy. Nei∣ther do I at present see how I shall get a liveli∣hood, when my powder and shot are all expend∣ed; but however I shall hardly be starved, for I saw several kinds of fruit in the woods, and some roots which look very much like carrots. As to cloaths, when mine wear out, I shall not much want new ones; for the weather is char∣mingly warm; and therefore, all things consi∣dered, I don't see why I should not be as happy here as in any other place.—When Jack had finished his speech, he set himself to find a lodg∣ing for the night. He had not examined far before he found a dry cavern in a rock, which he thought would prove a very comfortable residence; he therefore went to work with an hatchet he had with him, and cut some boughs of trees, which he spread upon the floor, and over those a long silky kind of grass, which he found in plenty near the place, to make him∣self a bed. His next care was, how to secure himself in case of any attack, for he did not know whether the island contained any wild beasts or not. He therefore cut down several branches of trees, and wove them into a kind of wicker work, as he had seen the men do hurdles when he lived with the farmer; with this contrivance he found he could very securely barricade the entrance of his cave. And now, as the evening was again approaching, he began to feel himself hungry, and seeking along the sea-shore, he found some shell-fish, which sup∣plied him with a plentiful meal. The next day Jack arose, a little melancholy indeed, but,
<PB N="37" REF="030190_0041_0FE503FF5B19F530"/>
with a resolution to struggle manfully with the difficulties of his situation. He walked into the woods and saw several kinds of fruit and berries, some of which he ventured to eat, as the birds had pecked them, and found the taste agreeable. He also dug up several species of roots, but feared to taste them lest they should be poisonous. At length, he selected one that very much resembled a potatoe, and determin∣ed to roast it in the embers, and taste a very small bit. It can hardly, thought Jack, do me much hurt, in so very small a quantity; and if that agrees with me I will increase the dose. The root was fortunately extremely wholesome and nutritive, so that Jack was in a very short time tolerably secure against the danger of wanting food. In this manner did Jack lead a kind of savage, but tolerably con∣tented life, for several months; during which time he enjoyed perfect health, and was never discovered by any of the natives. He used several times a day to visit the shore, in hopes that some ship might pass that way and deliver him from his solitary imprisonment. This, at length, happened, by the boat of an English ship, that was sailing to India, happening to touch upon the coast; Jack instantly hailed the crew, and the officer, upon hearing the story, agreed to receive him; the captain too, when he found that Jack was by no means a con∣temptible sailor, very willingly gave him his passage, and promised him a gratuity besides, if he behaved well.</P>
<P>Jack arrived in India without any accident, and relating his story, was permitted to serve
<FIGURE>
<PB N="38" REF="030190_0042_0FE5046868AC4AE0"/>
</FIGURE>
in another regiment as his own was no longer there. He soon distinguished himself by his courage and good behaviour on several occa∣sions, and before long was advanced to the rank of a serjeant. In this capacity, he was order∣ed out upon an expedition into the remote parts of the country. The little army in which he served now marched on for several weeks, through a burning climate, and in want of all the necessaries of life. At length, they entered upon some extensive plains, which bordered upon the celebrated country of the Tartars. Jack was perfectly well acquainted with the history of this people, and their method of fighting. He knew them to be some of the best horsemen in the world indefatigable in their attacks, though often repulsed returning to the charge, and not to be invaded with im∣punity; he, therefore, took the liberty of ob∣serving
<PB N="39" REF="030190_0043_0FE50400E3B9FB18"/>
to some of the officers, that nothing could be more dangerous than their rashly en∣gaging themselves in those extensive plains, where they were every moment exposed to the attacks of cavalry, without any successful me∣thod
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
of defence, or place of retreat, in case of any misfortune. These remonstrances were not much attended to, and after a few hours farther march, they were alarmed by the ap∣proach of a considerable body of Tartar horse∣men. They, however, drew up with all the order they were able, and firing several succes∣sive vollies, endeavoured to keep the enemy at a distance. But the Tartars had no design of doing that with a considerable loss, which they were sure of doing with ease and safety. Instead therefore of charging the Europeans, they con∣tented themselves with giving continual alarms, and menacing them on every side, without
<PB N="40" REF="030190_0044_0FE50472412EC7B8"/>
exposing themselves to any considerable dan∣ger. The army now attempted to retreat, ho∣ping that they should be able to arrive at the neighbouring mountains, where they would be safe from the incursions of the horse. But in this attempt they were equally disappointed; for another considerable body of enemies ap∣peared on that side, and blocked their passage. The Europeans now found they were surround∣ed on all sides, and that resistance was vain. The commanding officer, therefore, judged it expedient to try what could be effected by ne∣gociation, and sent one of his officers, who understood something of the Tartar language, to treat with the general of the enemies. The Tartar chief received the Europeans with great civility, and after having gently reproached them with their ambition, in coming so far to invade a people who had never injured them, he consented upon very moderate conditions to their enlargement: but he insisted upon having their arms delivered up, except a very few which he permitted them to keep for defence in their return, and upon retaining a certain number of Europeans as hostages for the performance of the stipulated articles. Among those who were thus left with the Tartars, Jack happened to be included, and while all the rest seemed incon∣solable at being thus made prisoners by a bar∣barous nation, he alone, accustomed to all the vicissitudes of life, retained his cheerfulness, and prepared to meet every reverse of fortune with his usual firmness.</P>
<P>The Tartars, among whom Jack was now to reside, constitute several different tribes or
<PB N="41" REF="030190_0045_0FE504039E3450A8"/>
nations which inhabit an immense extent of country both in Europe and Asia. Their coun∣try is in general open and uncultivated, with out cities or towns, such as we see in England. The inhabitants themselves are a bold and hardy race of men that live in small tents, and change their place of abode with the different seasons of the year. All their property consists in herds of cattle, which they drive along with them from place to place; and upon whose milk and flesh they subsist. They are particularly fond of horses, of which they have a small but ex∣cellent breed, hardy and indefatigable for the purposes of war, and they excel in the manage∣ment of them, beyond what is easy to con∣ceive. Immense herds of these animals wan∣der loose about the deserts, but marked with the particular mark of the person or tribe to which they belong. When they want any of these animals for use, a certain number of their young men jump upon their horses with nothing but an halter to guide them, each carrying in his hand a pole with a noose or cord at the end. When they come in sight of the herd, they pursue the horse they wish to take at full speed, come up with him in spite of his swift∣ness, and never fail to throw the noose about his neck as he runs. They are frequently known to jump upon young horses that have passed their whole life in the desert, and with only a girt around the animal's body to hold by, maintain their seat, in spite of all his vio∣lent exertions, until they have wearied him out and reduced him into perfect obedience. Such was the nation with whom the lot of Jack
<PB N="42" REF="030190_0046_0FE504740D42D620"/>
was now to reside, nor was he long before he had an opportunity of showing his talents.</P>
<P>It happened that a favourite horse of the chief was taken with a violent fever, and seem∣ed to be in immediate danger of death. The khan, for so he is called among the Tartars, seeing his horse grow hourly worse, at length applied to the Europeans, to know if they could suggest any thing for his recovery. All the officers were profoundly ignorant of far∣riery; but when the application was made to Jack, he desired to see the horse, and with great gravity began to feel his pulse, by passing his hand within the animal's fore-leg; which gave the Tartars a very high idea of his ingenuity. Finding that the animal was in a high fever, he proposed to the khan to let him blood, which he had learned to do very dexterously in England. He obtained permission to do as he pleased, and having by great good luck a lancet
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="43" REF="030190_0047_0FE5040E1B749080"/>
with him, he let him blood very dexterously in the neck. After this operation he covered him up, and gave him a warm potion made out of such ingredients as he could procure upon the spot, and left him quiet. In a few hours the horse began to mend, and, to the great joy of the khan, perfectly recovered in a few days. This cure, so opportunely perfor∣med, raised the reputation of Jack so high, that every body came to consult him about their horses, and in a short time he was the universal farrier of the tribe. The khan him∣self conceived so great an affection for him, that he gave him an excellent horse to ride upon and attend him in his hunting parties; and Jack, who excelled in the art of horsemanship, managed him so well as to gain the esteem of the whole nation.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="030190_0048_0FE50475D0F92B48"/>
The Tartars, though they are excellent horsemen, have no idea of managing their horses, unless by violence; but Jack in a short time, by continual care and attention, made his horse so docile and obedient to every mo∣tion of his hand and leg, that the Tartars themselves would gaze upon him with admi∣ration, and allow themselves to be out-done. Not contented with this, he procured some iron, and made his horse-shoes in the Euro∣pean taste; this also was matter of astonishment to all the Tartars, who are accustomed to ride their horses unshod. He next observed that the Tartar saddles are all prodigiously large and cumbersome, raising the horsemen up to a great distance from the back of his horse. Jack set himself to work, and was not long before he had completed something like an English hunt∣ing saddle, on which he paraded before the khan. All mankind seem to have a passion for novelty, and the khan was so delighted with this effort of Jack's ingenuity, that, after paying him the highest compliments, he intimated a desire of having such a saddle for himself. Jack was the most obliging creature in the world, and spared no labour to serve his friends; he went to work again, and in a short time com∣pleted a saddle still more elegant for the khan. These exertions gained him the favour and esteem both of the khan and all the tribe; so that Jack was an universal favourite and loaded with presents, while all the rest of the officers, who had never learned to make a saddle or an horse-shoe, were treated with contempt and indifference. Jack, indeed, behaved with the
<PB N="45" REF="030190_0049_0FE50410219CFEE8"/>
greatest generosity to his countrymen, and divid∣ed with them all the mutton and venison which were given him; but he could not help some∣times observing, that it was great pity they had not learned to make an horse-shoe instead of dancing and dressing hair.</P>
<P>And now an ambassador arrived from the English settlements, with an account that all the conditions of the treaty had been perform∣ed, and demanding the restitution of the pri∣soners. The Tartar chief was too much a man of honour to delay an instant, and they were all restored; but before they set out, Jack laboured with indefatigable zeal to finish a cou∣ple of saddles and a dozen horse-shoes, which he presented to the khan, with many expressions of gratitude. The khan was charmed with this proof of his affection, and in return made him a present of a couple of fine horses, and seve∣ral valuable skins of beasts. Jack arrived without any accident at the English settlements, and selling his skins and horses, found himself in possession of a moderate sum of money. He now began to have a desire to return to Eng∣land, and one of the officers, who had often been obliged to him during his captivity, pro∣cured him a discharge. He embarked, there∣fore, with all his property, on board a ship, which was returning home, and in a few months was safely landed at Plymouth.</P>
<P>But Jack was too active and too prudent to give himself up to idleness. After considering various schemes of business, he determined to take up his old trade of forging; and for that purpose made a journey into the North, and
<FIGURE>
<PB N="46" REF="030190_0050_0FE504E2EEB951A8"/>
</FIGURE>
found his old master alive, and as active as ever. His master, who had always entertained an esteem for Jack, welcomed him with great affection, and being in want of a foreman, he engaged him at a very handsome price, for that place. Jack was now indefatigable in the execution of his new office; inflexibly honest where the interests of his master were concern∣ed, and at the same time humane and oblig∣ing to the men who were under him, he gain∣ed the affection of all about him. In a few years, his master was so thoroughly convinced of his merit, that growing old himself, he took Jack into partnership, and committed the management of the whole business to his care. He continued to exert the same qualities now which he had done before, by which means he improved the business so much, as to gain a considerable fortune, and become one of the
<PB N="47" REF="030190_0051_0FE50477590DC1E0"/>
most respectable manufacturers in the country.—But, with all this prosperity, he never dis∣covered the least pride or haughtiness; on the contrary, he employed part of his fortune to purchase the moor where he formerly lived, and built himself a small but convenient house, upon the very spot where his daddy's hut had formerly stood. Hither he would sometimes retire from business, and cultivate his garden with his own hands, for he hated idleness.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>To all his poor neighbours he was kind and liberal, relieving them in their distress, and often entertaining them at his house, where he used to dine with them, with the greatest affa∣bility,
<PB N="48" REF="030190_0052_0FE504F7C1A43250"/>
and frequently relate his own story; in order to prove that it is of very little conse∣quence how a man comes into the world, pro∣vided he behaves well, and discharges his duty when he is in it.</P>

<HEAD>THE LITTLE QUEEN.</HEAD>
<P>THERE reigned once upon a time, in a distant island, a good prince who was pas∣sionately beloved by all his subjects. It could not happen otherwise, for he was their common father. He provided for all their reasonable wants, he rewarded those who deserved well of their country, and he let none of the wicked, nor even of the idle, escape without punish∣ment. This amiable monarch had but one cause of anxiety; Myra, his only child, by no means requited the attention which had been given to her education. At twelve years of age she was shamefully ignorant. Her thought∣lessness made her forget every lesson which she had been taught, and her presumption kept pace with her want of knowledge; of conse∣quence as she thought herself perfectly accom∣plished, she despised all instruction. One day
<PB N="49" REF="030190_0053_0FE504820B96FAE0"/>
she was indulging her absurd vanity by hinting, that were she to govern the island, things would be better managed than they were now. The King, having been informed of his daughter's sentiments, sent for her immediately. On her coming, he told her, without the least discom∣posure, <Q>That as she was destined to reign, one day or other, over his kingdoms, he should wish to know how far her talents were proper for so important a charge. "We may, if you please," added this good prince, make the experiment without any delay. Careless as you always were about the les∣sons which have been given you in geogra∣phy, you cannot but know that <HI>The Fortu∣nate Island</HI> makes a part of my dominions; it is a small, but well inhabited district; its people are active, industrious, good tempered, and thoroughly attached to their sovereigns. Go, child! reign over them, I shall order a yacht to be instantly fitted up to convey you to your capital.</Q> Then making a most pro∣found reverence to the little sovereign, "Adieu, "madam," said he, with difficulty concealing a smile.</P>
<P>Myra, for some time, thought that the king meant only to divert himself, but soon found her mistake, and that every thing was preparing for her voyage. She was even permitted to form a court to her mind, and accordingly she picked out a dozen of her playfellows to ac∣company her. "These young people," said she to her father, <Q>are so very rational and se∣date, that there can be no need of their being attended by governesses or tutors.</Q> The
<PB N="50" REF="030190_0054_0FE504F94CB75F00"/>
king, however, thought otherwise, and ordered the teachers to embark with their pupils. The young sovereign, on her part, took care there should be abundance of musicians for her balls, and that a company of players should be pro∣vided for the amusement of herself and her court. On the morn of her departure, she took an affectionate leave of her father, but the few tears which she shed, were soon dried up by the consideration of her being going to a place where she should do "just what she pleased." "The only advice that I shall give you," said the king at parting, <Q>is, that you would fol∣low the advice of Aristus (the governor of the island over which you are to reign) in every thing of importance. He is a man for whom I have a high esteem, and with reason, as he is discreet, honest, and humane. I could wish that you would make him your first minister; I mean, that you should consult him in every thing, and entrust him with the execution of all your orders.</Q></P>
<P>This direction no way suited the taste of our young Queen, who wished to have given that important charge to one of her favourites, Philintus, a tall, genteel lad, not indeed many years older than herself, but one who, to to∣lerable skill in dancing and singing, added the very agreeable talent of elegant flattery. He was himself as averse to study, and of conse∣quence as ignorant as his royal mistress; but he had knowledge enough of his own interest to excite him never to omit assuring her that every one looked on her as a model of a per∣fect princess, although he was conscious that,
<PB N="51" REF="030190_0055_0FE50483EBD4BBD0"/>
out of her hearing, she was universally blamed for being so totally unlike her excellent father, and for spending her whole time in trifling amusements.</P>
<P>As soon as the little sovereign reached her island, she beheld with pleasure troops of shep∣herds and shepherdesses, in elegant fancy dres∣ses of rose colour and white, who sung carols in praise of their new Queen, strewed sweet scented flowers in her path, and presented her with odoriferous nosegays. Myra, charmed with this specimen of her subjects gallantry, ordered money to be distributed amongst them; and, under the conduct of Aristus, repaired to a lovely, though small palace, fitted up for her reception. Fatigued with the voyage, the Queen and her young court hastened to their repose; but her Majesty forgot not to order, for the next day, a comedy to be acted, followed by a ball and a splendid entertainment. On the next morn, Myra and her court amused themselves by walking into the capital town, which lay not far from the palace. "Observe," said Aristus to his sovereign, <Q>the air of con∣tent which reigns in every face we meet.</Q> "That," said Philintus, <Q>we should attri∣bute to the presence of our lovely Queen.</Q> "Without doubt," replied Aristus, <Q>they are sensible of that honour; but I ought to in∣form you, that their gaiety is chiefly owing to their being conscious of the excellent go∣vernment under which they live, and of the wisdom of those laws by which their King, whom they look upon as their father, go∣verns the country.</Q> "Let us now," said
<PB N="52" REF="030190_0056_0FE504FB61412730"/>
Myra, "extend our walks into the country." They did so. An orchard, in full bloom, now tempted her to take a nearer view of its beauty. "What," said she to Aristus, <Q>occasions the buzzing sounds which I hear?</Q> "The bees," replied he; <Q>a useful tribe of your Majesty's subjects.</Q> At that instant, most unfortu∣nately, one of these animals, not perfectly ac∣quainted with the respect due to royalty, and disgusted at the Queen's approaching too near to his hive, settled on her hand, and made her feel his sting!—<Q>Shocking creatures, these bees! exclaimed Myra; one of them has half killed me!</Q> <Q>The presumptuous, un∣grateful wretches ought, said Philintus, to be utterly extirpated.</Q> <Q>You are right, said the Queen; I will have them destroyed, not on my own account, but to preserve my poor people from receiving such cruel wounds, when they are pursuing their occupations in the country.</Q> <Q>Permit me, said Aristus, to observe, that these accidents happen but very seldom, and that the pain which the bees occasion by their stings, is trifling, when compared with the vast advantage which ac∣crues from their labours; your subjects, madam, will suffer severely indeed, if they are deprived of that useful creature.</Q>—Here he was interrupted by Philintus, who bursting with laughter, cried out, <Q>A pretty tale you tell us, Aristus! why sure you take us all for children! Suffer indeed! what! because that nasty insect is kept from stinging them! Make us believe <HI>that,</HI> if you can.</Q> <Q>I will have every bee in my kingdom put to death,</Q>
<PB N="53" REF="030190_0057_0FE50485CCA89DA8"/>
said the young Queen with an air of dignity. <Q>Possibly, said Aristus, your Majesty may see cause hereafter to repent of this hasty command.</Q> <Q>Nevertheless, repeated Myra, it <HI>shall</HI> be executed.</Q> Aristus retired with a sigh, and Philintus loudly applauded the ming∣led humanity and firmness of his infant sove∣reign. That evening the Queen entertained herself at the play, and afterwards was present at a ball, which, with a magnificent supper, lasted until two o'clock in the morning.</P>
<P>Unluckily among the ladies of the bedcham∣ber were two, who, not having reached their eleventh year, had been used to eat little or no suppers, to take moderate exercise, and to go to bed early. But the royal banquet had been so tempting, the ball so charming, and the whole so perfectly new to them, that they had despised the admonitions of their governesses, who had very naturally remonstrated against their launching at once into this new system. In consequence, they were both extremely ill the next morning. The physician attended, and ordered proper medicines, which they re∣fused to take. <Q>They were permitted by the Queen, they said, to do what they liked best, and they hated nasty physic.</Q> Their complaints, however, increased; they could neither eat, drink, or sleep, and one of the two felt the attack of a fever. On this the go∣vernesses were obliged to have recourse to the royal authority, and the Queen having com∣manded the young ladies to submit to disci∣pline, they took what was ordered and all went right again.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="030190_0058_0FE5050C46341AB0"/>
One day that the young Queen was walking in the garden of her palace, she was disgusted at the devastation which had been made by ca∣terpillars on the leaves of the trees. <Q>What vile creatures are these!</Q> said she to Philin∣tus: <Q>Did you ever see such a piece of work as they have made here?</Q> <Q>I think, re∣plied the courtier, that it would be a good deed to root them out of the island, and to proclaim rewards for those who would un∣dertake to destroy them.</Q> <Q>What say you to that, Aristus, said Myra, can my sub∣jects exist without caterpillars?</Q> <Q>Your Majesty, replied Aristus, has not forgot the bees, I find, but here the case is widely different. The caterpillars which have stript those trees do much mischief, and are of no one use to society.</Q> <Q>I am heartily glad, said the Queen, that we coincide in opinion, for I am determined to have all the cater∣pillars in my dominions destroyed; I hate them, nasty creatures!</Q> <Q>Your Majesty said Aristus, certainly means to except from this general massacre, that kind of caterpil∣lar which produces the silk-worm.</Q> <Q>Do but hear him,</Q> said Philintus, in the Queen's ear; <Q>that fellow makes a point of contradict∣ing your Majesty in every thing.</Q> <Q>Let every caterpillar in my realm be put to death,</Q> ex∣claimed the piqued sovereign.</P>
<P><Q>I am tired to death,</Q> said Myra, one day,<Q> of this eternal verdure. These walks of turf, and these clumps of laurel, though I like them well enough on the whole, yet being repeated so often, they fatigue my eyes;—
<PB N="55" REF="030190_0059_0FE504875598A7F0"/>
green, and green, and nothing but green—Why can I not have a rose-colour bower?</Q> Philintus now turned all his thoughts towards the accomplishment of his sovereign's rational wish. He had observed in a distant part of the garden an arbour where a honeysuckle overspread the green frame work. He ordered the leaves to be stripped off, the wood to be painted rose colour, and he covered the whole with artificial roses hanging by crimson rib-bands. The Queen was enchanted with this gaudy retreat, and as soon as she saw it, ordered her dinner to be set out upon that very spot. The sun shone out with great power, and scarce had the company sate ten minutes at their meal, before some complained of aching heads, some of dazzled eyes; all lost their appetites, and the whole was a confusion of heat and glare. Aristus advised the whole party to abandon the flaring scene, and to refresh their eyes by gazing on the turf in some shady place. They did so, and all went well again. In conse∣quence, it was settled by her Majesty in coun∣cil, that, during the summer, it were better for the leaves of the trees to be green, than to be rose colour.</P>
<P>Myra was so enchanted with the pleasures of her palace, that she gave herself little trouble as to what passed in the island at large. Her whole time was employed in schemes for in∣creasing and varying her amusements: some∣times, indeed, she walked into the country: but her presence no longer appeared to give any pleasure to her subjects—there were no more songs in her praise—no more cries of
<PB N="56" REF="030190_0060_0FE5050DE412F470"/>
"Long live our Queen!" "What," said Myra, <Q>can occasion this strange alteration in the behaviour of my people? Are they dis∣pleased with any part of my government?</Q> <Q>If, said Philintus, they are out of humour with such an amiable sovereign, they do not deserve the honour of her inquiries.</Q> This answer was not entirely satisfactory to the Queen; she was even for some time, buried in thought; but the efforts of Philintus, (who had observed the gloom on her countenance,) and the gay turn of his conversation, together with the novelty of an entertainment which he proposed for the next evening, drove away all serious thoughts, and sprightliness resumed its reign again. The plan was, that all the court should appear in pastoral dresses, and that the company should dance on one of those elegant lawns with which the palace garden abounded. Myra approved of this plan, only desiring that the habits might be as elegant as the plan would allow. <Q>They can only be made of linen, madam,</Q> said one of the bedchamber-women. "How so,?" said the Queen.</P>
<P><Q>There is not, in your Majesty's dominions, silk enough for one dress.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You must be mistaken. On my taking the government into my hands, I observed shops without end, well furnished with silk.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is true, Madam, there were such; but they are now all shut up, and the owners have left the island.</Q></P>
<P>"And why so, pray?"</P>
<P><Q>Since your Majesty's orders for the destruc∣tion
<PB N="57" REF="030190_0061_0FE50491A8EF4368"/>
of all caterpillars, the silk manufacture is entirely stopped.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Aye! why, what have those nasty vermin to do with the manufacture of silk?</Q></P>
<P><Q>There is one species of those caterpillars which produces the materials, without which silk cannot be made; and as the sellers of silk in the towns are in general connected, by marriage or relationship, with the breed∣ers of the silk-worms, they have determined all together to quit a country where they are deprived of the means of subsisting.</Q></P>
<P>That very evening the Queen observed with a surprise, which almost equalled horror, that the apartments of the palace were lighted with tallow candles. "Heavens!" exclaimed the affronted Sovereign, <Q>what means this filthy sight?</Q> She was told that there were no wax∣en tapers to be found in the isle. "'Tis im∣possible!" she cried; "let Aristus be sent for." He appeared. <Q>Have you not told me, Sir, that my island abounded with wax?</Q> <Q>Madam, it did so, when I gave you that in∣formation.</Q> <Q>And how happens it that it is not so now?</Q> <Q>Because since your Ma∣jesty ordered the bees to be extirpated, no more wax is to be found.</Q> Philintus sneer∣ed at this reply, and Myra asked with astonish∣ment, <Q>What was the connexion between bees and tapers?</Q> <Q>Without them, said Aristus, the tapers can not exist, since the bees supply the materials of which the tapers are composed.</Q> <Q>And what is become of those who used to get their living by making those tapers?</Q> <Q>Poor souls! replied Aris∣tus
<PB N="58" REF="030190_0062_0FE5050FB5029E20"/>
they are on the point of quitting a place, where they cannot earn their bread. Alas! added he, were your Majesty to make, at this time, the tour of your dominions, you would find the face of the whole country de∣plorably altered.</Q> Philinus would have turned this account into ridicule, but Myra, by a look, stopped his buffoonery, and retired to her chamber with a heavy heart.</P>
<P>The next morning she took Aristus with her, and drove into the environs of her capital. <Q>You were too much in the right, she said, when you bade me expect a deplorable alter∣ation among my people. I hear no more acclamations! no more songs! but I see the painfullest of sights; crowds of people in rags, begging their bread,</Q> <Q>Formerly, said Aristus, no beggars were to be found here; there was a large building erected for the poor, where the old were maintained, the sick cured, and all the young folks set to work; but since your Majesty has allow∣ed twelve to be the age of discretion, many of these children have refused to be employ∣ed, and choosing to wander about the country, without knowing how to get their bread, they are of course reduced to rags and misery.</Q></P>
<P>The Queen, having given some relief to these wretched objects, proceeded to ask Aris∣tus, what was become of the crowds of busy people who were used to throng in the streets of the capital? "for," said she, <Q>half the houses seem to be shut up, and the whole town ap∣pears deserted, in comparison of its state when I first saw it.</Q> The minister told her,
<Q><PB N="59" REF="030190_0063_0FE5049352CBA540"/>
that there was a mutual dependence of one trade upon another, and that, in consequence of the departure of the silk and wax mer∣chants and manufacturers, those who were used to supply that large body of men with cloaths, shoes and stockings, provisions, and every other accommodation, having now no market for their goods, had shut up their shops, and were preparing, one and all, for their departure. He added, that it was much to be feared, that the farmers, who used to bring to the town corn, hay, butter, eggs, poultry, &amp;c. together with their fami∣lies, labourers, &amp;c. would soon follow this example.</Q></P>
<P>Struck with this painful detail, the young Queen, whose goodness of heart was equal to the thoughtlessness of her head, exclaimed in an agony of distress, <Q>Oh heavens! why did I leave my father's court? why take upon me a task of which I was so incapable? I suffer severely for my presumption, but at least I will do no more mischief here.</Q> Then turning to Aristus, she begged him to hasten the preparations for her return to the kingdom of her father. Her orders were in∣stantly obeyed, and she with her whole court, took leave of the Fortunate Island, and soon reached the port they wished for. As soon as Myra saw the King, she threw herself at his feet, bathed in tears. <Q>How is this, said he, my daughter, are you returned already? are you so soon weary of sovereign power?</Q> <Q>Alas! Sire! replied the weeping Myra, never was any being more wretched than your
<PB N="60" REF="030190_0064_0FE5051485E2C278"/>
daughter! I have childishly thrown away my own happiness, and that of those whom you entrusted to my care. The island which I have governed, no longer deserves the name of Fortunate. I have, by my own misma∣nagement, reduced an industrious people to beggary and ruin! but I conjure you, Sire, to order all my jewels to be instantly sold, that I may, by their means, in some sort re∣lieve the miseries which my infantine folly has brought upon them.</Q> <Q>Make yourself easy,</Q> said the good King, soothing his af∣flicted daughter, <Q>the mischiefs which your want of consideration has caused, are by no means irreparable. I foresaw that you would make great mistakes in government, and ma∣naged affairs so as to prevent those mistakes from having any very bad consequences. Those of your subjects, who have by your errors been forced to quit your isle, have, by the direction of Aristus, found a comfortable retreat in this kingdom, have been supplied with all necessaries, and will now return to their own country, with proper materials, to re-assume their several trades and occupa∣tions. You have, my beloved Myra, an ex∣cellent heart, and in all the mischief which you have done, you have had the best inten∣tion in the world. This ought to teach you, that princes ought not to trust to their good dispositions alone, but that they should take counsel with the most intelligent of their sub∣jects, concerning the measures of their go∣vernment, and above all, that they should guard against forming too high an opinion of
<PB N="61" REF="030190_0065_0FE50494DD779440"/>
their own wisdom. The errors of private persons can only affect a small number of individuals, but those of sovereigns may ruin nations.</Q></P>
<P>Myra profited by this lesson, and by her own experience. She dedicated, for the future, a considerable part of her time to study, and for∣bade Philantus ever to appear in her presence again.</P>

<HEAD>The NATURAL HISTORY of the BEE.</HEAD>
<P>TO give a complete history of this insect in a few pages, which some have exhaust∣ed volumes in describing, and whose nature and properties still continue in dispute, is impossi∣ble. It will be sufficient to give a general idea of the animal's operations; which, though they have been studied for more than two thousand years, are still but incompletely known. The account given us by Reaumur is sufficiently minute; and, if true, sufficient∣ly wonderful: but I find many of the facts which he relates, doubted by those who are most conversant with bees; and some of them actually declared not to have a real existence in nature.</P>
<P>It is unhappy, therefore, for those whose me∣thod demands an history of bees, that they are unfurnished with those materials which have
<PB N="62" REF="030190_0066_0FE5051F5B387D98"/>
induced so many observers to contradict so great a naturalist. His life was spent in the contemplation; and it requires an equal share of attention to prove the error of his discove∣ries. Without entering, therefore, into the dispute, I will take him for my guide; and just mention, as I go along, those particulars in which succeeding observers have begun to think him erroneous. Which of the two are right, time only can discover; for my part I have only heard one side, for as yet none have been so bold as openly to oppose Reaumur's delightful researches.</P>
<P>There are three different kinds of bees in every hive. First, the labouring bees, which make up the far greatest number, and are thought to be neither male or female, but mere∣ly born for the purposes of labour, and continu∣ing the breed, by supplying the young with provision, while yet in their helpless state. The second sort are the drones; they are of a darker colour, longer, and more thick by one third than the former: they are supposed to be the males; and there is not above a hundred of them, in a hive of seven or eight thousand bees. The third sort is much larger than either of the former, and still fewer in number: some assert, that there is not above one in every swarm; but this later observers affirm not to be true, there being sometimes five or six in the same hive. These are called queen-bees, and are said to lay all the eggs from which the whole swarm is hatched in a season.</P>
<P>In examining the structure of the common working bee, the first remarkable part that of∣fers
<PB N="63" REF="030190_0067_0FE504967458ECB8"/>
is the trunk, which serves to extract the honey from flowers. It is not formed, like that of the other flies, in the manner of a tube, by which the fluid is to be sucked up; but like a besom, to sweep, or a tongue, to lick it a∣way. The animal is furnished also with teeth, which serve it in making wax. This substance is gathered from flowers, like honey; it con∣sists of that dust or farina which contributes to the fecundation of plants, and is moulded into wax by the little animal, at leisure. Every bee, when it leaves the hive to collect this precious store, enters into the cup of the flower, parti∣cularly such as seem charged with the greatest quantities of this yellow farina. As the ani∣mal's body is covered over with hair, it rolls itself within the flower, and soon becomes quite covered with the dust, which it soon after brushes off with its own hind legs, and kneads into two little balls. In the thighs of the hind legs there are to cavities, edged with hair; and into these, as into a basket, the animal sticks its pellets. Thus employed, the bee flies from flower to flower, encreasing its store, and adding to its stock of wax; until the ball, upon each thigh, becomes as big as a grain of pepper: by this time, having got a sufficient load, it returns, the best of its way to the hive.</P>
<P>The belly of the bee is divided into six rings, which sometimes shorten the body, by slipping one over the other. It contains within it, be∣side the intestines, the honey-bag, the venom-bag, and the sting. The honey-bag is as trans∣parent as crystal, containing the honey that
<PB N="64" REF="030190_0068_0FE505211CB6A5A0"/>
the bee has brushed from the flowers; of which the greater part is carried to the hive, and poured into the cells of the honey-comb; while the remainder serves for the bee's own nourishment: for, during summer, it never touches what has been laid up for the winter. The sting, which serves to defend this little ani∣mal from its enemies, is composed of three parts; the sheath, and two darts, which are extremely small and penetrating. Both the darts have several small points or barbs, like those of a fish-hook, which render the sting more painful, and make the darts rankle in the wound. Still, however, this instrument would be very slight, did not the bee poison the wound. The sheath, which has a sharp point, makes the first impression; which is fol∣lowed by that of the darts, and then the vene∣mous liquor is poured in. The sheath some∣times sticks so fast in the wound, that the ani∣mal is obliged to leave it behind; by which the bee soon after dies, and the wound is con∣siderably enflamed. It might at first appear well for mankind, if the bee were without its sting: but, upon recollection, it will be found, that the little animal would then have too ma∣ny rivals in sharing its labours. An hundred other lazy animals, fond of honey, and hating labour, would intrude upon the sweets of the hive; and the treasure would be carried off, for want of armed guardians to protect it.</P>
<P>From examining the bee singly, we now come to consider it in society, as an animal not only subject to laws, but active, vigilant, la∣borious, and disinterested. All its provisions
<PB N="65" REF="030190_0069_0FE504A480ACCE48"/>
are laid up for the community; and all its arts in building a cell, designed for the benefit of posterity. The substance with which bees build their cells is wax: which is fashioned into con∣venient apartments for themselves and their young. When they begin to work in their hives, they divide themselves into four com∣panies: one of which roves in the fields in search of materials; another employs itself in laying out the bottom and partitions of their cells; a third is employed in making the inside smooth from the corners and angles; and the fourth company bring food for the rest, or re∣lieve those who return with their respective bur∣thens. But they are not kept constant to one employment; they often change the tasks as∣signed them: those that have been at work, being permitted to go abroad; and those that have been in the fields already, take their places. They seem even to have signs, by which they understand each other; for when any of them want food, it bends down its trunk to the bee from whom it is expected, which then opens its honey-bag, and lets some drops fall into the other's mouth, which is at that time opened to receive it. Their diligence and labour is so great, that, in a day's time, they are able to make cells, which lie upon each other, numerous enough to contain three thousand bees.</P>
<P>If we examine their cells, they will be found formed in the exactest proportion. It was said by Pappus, an ancient geometrician, that, of all other figures, hexagons were the most con∣venient;
<PB N="66" REF="030190_0070_0FE50522A9375888"/>
for, when placed touching each other the most convenient room would be given, and the smallest lost. The cells of the bees are perfect hexagons: these, in every honey-comb, are double, opening on either side, and closed at the bottom. The bottoms are composed of little triangular panes, which, when united together, terminate in a point, and lie exactly upon the extremities of other panes of the same shape, in opposite cells. These lodgings have spaces, like streets, between them, large enough to give the bees a free passage in and out; and yet narrow enough to preserve the necessary heat. The mouth of every cell is defended by a border, which makes the door a little less than the inside of the cell, which serves to strengthen the whole. These cells serve for different purposes: for laying up their young; for their wax, which in winter becomes a part of their food; and for their honey, which makes their principal subsistence.</P>
<P>It is well known that the habitation of bees ought to be very close; and what their hives want, from the negligence and unskilfulness of man, these animals supply by their own in∣dustry: so that it is their principal care, when first hived, to stop up all the crannies. For this purpose they make use of a resinous gum, which is more tenacious than wax, and differs greatly from it. This the ancients called Pro∣polis: it will grow considerably hard in June; though it will in some measure soften by heat; and is often found different in consistence, co∣lour and smell. It has generally an agreeable aromatic odour when it is warmed; and by
<PB N="67" REF="030190_0071_0FE504A60CE08A10"/>
some it is considered as a most grateful perfume. When the bees begin to work with it, it is soft, but it acquires a firmer consistence every day; till at length it assumes a brown colour, and becomes much harder than wax. The bees car∣ry it on their hinder legs; and some think it is met with on the birch, the willow, and pop∣lar. However it is procured, it is certain that they plaister the inside of their hives with this composition.</P>
<P>If examined through a glass hive, from the hurry the whole swarm is in, the whole at first appears like anarchy and confusion; but the spectator soon finds every animal diligently employed, and following one pursuit, with a settled purpose. Their teeth are the instru∣ments by which they model and fashion their various buildings, and give them such symme∣try and perfection. They begin at the top of the hive; and several of them work at a time, at the cells which have two faces. If they are stinted with regard to time, they give the new cells but half the depth which they ought to have; leaving them imperfect, till they have sketched out the number of cells necessary for the present occasion. The construction of their combs, costs them a great deal of labour: they are made by insensible additions; and not cast at once in a mold, as some are apt to imagine. There seems no end of their shaping, finishing, and turning them neatly up. The cells for their young are most carefully formed; those designed for lodging the drones, are larger than the rest; and that for the queen-bee, the lar∣gest of all. The cells in which the young
<PB N="68" REF="030190_0072_0FE5052430E59FB8"/>
brood are lodged, serve at different times for containing honey; and this proceeds from an obvious cause: every worm, before it is trans∣formed into an aurelia, hangs its old skin on the partitions of its cell; and thus, while it strengthens the wall, diminishes the capacity of its late apartment. The same cell, in a single summer, is often tenanted by three or four worms in succession; and the next season, by three or four more. Each worm takes particu∣lar care to fortify the pannels of its cell, by hanging up its spoils there: thus, the partitions being lined, six or eight deep, become at last too narrow for a new brood, and are converted into store-houses, for honey.</P>
<P>Those cells where nothing but honey is de∣posited, are much deeper than the rest. When the harvest of honey is so plentiful that they have not sufficient room for it, they either lengthen their combs, or build more; which are much longer than the former. Sometimes they work at three combs at a time; for, when there are three work-houses, more bees may be thus employed, without embarrassment.</P>
<P>But honey, as was before observed, is not the only food upon which these animals subsist. The meal of flowers, of which their wax is formed, is one of their most favourite repasts. This is a diet which they live upon during the summer; and of which they lay up a large win∣ter provision. The wax of which their combs are made, is no more than this meal digested, and wrought into a paste. When the flowers upon which bees generally feed, are not fully blown, and this meal or dust is not offered in
<PB N="69" REF="030190_0073_0FE504A7E696CCA8"/>
sufficient quantities, the bees pinch the tops of the stamina in which it is contained, with their teeth; and thus anticipate the progress of vegetation. In April and May, the bees are busy, from morning to evening, in gathering this meal; but when the weather becomes too hot in the midst of summer, they work only in the morning.</P>
<P>The bee is furnished with a stomach for its wax, as well as its honey. In the former of the two, their powder is altered, digested and concocted into real wax; and is thus ejected by the same passage by which it was swallowed. Every comb, newly made, is white: but it be∣comes yellow as it grows old, and almost black when kept too long in the hive. Beside the wax thus digested, there is a large portion of the powder kneaded up for food in every hive, and kept in separate cells, for winter provi∣sion. This is called, by the country people, bee-bread; and contributes to the health and strength of the animal during winter. Those who rear bees, may rob them of their honey, and feed them, during the winter, with treacle; but no proper substitute has yet been found for the bee-bread; and, without it, the ani∣mals become consumptive and die.</P>
<P>As for the honey, it is extracted from that part of the flower called the nectareum. From the mouth this delicious fluid passes into the gullet: and then into the first stomach, or ho∣ney-bag, which, when filled, appears like an oblong bladder. Children, that live in coun∣try places, are well acquainted with this blad∣der; and destroy many bees to come at their
<PB N="70" REF="030190_0074_0FE5052BD8EC37F0"/>
store of honey. When a bee has sufficiently filled its first stomach, it returns back to the hive, where it disgorges the honey into one of the cells. It often happens that the bee deli∣vers its store to some other, at the mouth of the hive, and flies off for a fresh supply. Some honey-combs are always left open for common use; but many others are stopped up, till there is a necessity of opening them. Each of these are covered carefully with wax; so close, that the covers seem to be made at the very instant the fluid is deposited within them.</P>
<P>Having thus given a cursory description of the insect, individually considered, and of the habitation it forms, we next come to its social habits and institutions: and, in considering this little animal attentively, after the necessary precautions for the immediate preservation of the community, its second care is turned to the continuance of posterity. How numerous so∣ever the multitude of bees may appear in one swarm, yet they all owe their original to a sin∣gle parent, which is called the queen-bee. It is indeed surprising that a single insect shall, in one summer, give birth to above twenty thou∣sand young: but, upon opening her body, the wonder will cease; as the number of eggs ap∣pearing, at one time, amounts to five thousand. This animal, whose existence is of such impor∣tance to her subjects, may easily be distinguish∣ed from the rest, by her size, and the shape of her body. On her safety depends the whole welfare of the commonwealth; and the atten∣tions paid her by all the rest of the swarm, evi∣dently show the dependence her subjects have
<PB N="71" REF="030190_0075_0FE504ABD8A9E378"/>
upon her security. If this insect be carefully observed, she will be seen at times attended with a numerous retinue, marching from cell to cell, plunging the extremity of her body into many of them, and leaving a small egg in each. When the queen-bee has deposited the number of eggs necessary in the cells, the working bees undertake the care of the rising posterity. They are seen to leave off their usual employments; to construct proper receptacles for eggs; or to complete those that are already formed. They purposely build little cells, extremely solid, for the young; in which they employ a great deal of wax: those designed for lodging the males, as was already observed, are larger than the rest; and those for the queen-bees the lar∣gest of all. There is usually but one egg de∣posited in every cell. A day or two after it is deposited, the worm is excluded from the shell of the egg, having the appearance of a maggot rolled up in a ring, and lying softly on a bed of a whitish coloured jelly; upon which also the little animal begins to feed. In the mean time, the instant it appears, the working bees attend it with the most anxious and parental tenderness; they furnish it every hour with a supply of this whitish substance, on which it feeds and lies; and watch the cell with unre∣mitting care. They are nurses that have a greater affection for the offspring of others, than many parents have for their own children. They are constant in visiting each cell, and see∣ing that nothing is wanting; preparing the white mixture, which is nothing but a compo∣sition
<PB N="72" REF="030190_0076_0FE5055A9585B848"/>
of honey and wax, in their own bowels, with which they feed them. Thus attended, and plentifully fed, the worm, in less than six days time, comes to its full growth, and no longer accepts the food offered it. When the bees perceive that it has no further occasion for feeding, they perform the last offices of tend∣erness, and shut the little animal up in its cell; walling up the mouth of its apartment with wax: there they leave the worm to itself; hav∣ing secured it from every external injury.</P>
<P>The worm is no sooner left enclosed, but, from a state of inaction, it begins to labour, ex∣tending and shortening its body; and by this means lining the walls of its apartment with a silken tapestry, which it spins in the manner of caterpillars, before they undergo their last transformation. When their cell is thus pre∣pared, the animal is soon after transformed in∣to an aurelia; but differing from that of the common caterpillar, as it exhibits not only the legs, but the wings of the future bee, in its present state of inactivity. Thus, in about twenty, or one and twenty days after the egg was laid, the bee is completely formed, and fitted to undergo the fatigues of its state. When all its parts have acquired their proper strength and consistence, the young animal opens its prison, by piercing with its teeth the waxen door that confines it. When just freed from its cell, it is as yet moist, and incommoded with the spoils of its former situation; but the officious bees are soon seen to flock round it, and to lick it clean on all sides with their trunks; while another band, with equal assiduity, are
<PB N="73" REF="030190_0077_0FE504B7C1BBD900"/>
observed to feed it with honey: others again begin immediately to cleanse the cell that has been just left; to carry the ordures out of the hive, and to fit the place for a new inhabitant. The young bee soon repays their care, by its industry; for as soon as ever its external parts become dry, it discovers its natural appetites for labour, and industriously begins the task, which it pursues unremittingly through life. The toil of man is irksome to him, and he earns his subsistence with pain; but this little animal seems happy in its pursuits, and finds delight in all its employments.</P>
<P>When bees first begin to break their prisons, there are generally above a hundred excluded in one day. Thus, in the space of a few weeks, the number of the inhabitants in one hive, of moderate size, becomes so great, that there is no place to contain the new comers; and they are scarcely excluded from the cell, when they are obliged, by the old bees, to sally forth in quest of new habitations. In other words, the hive begins to swarm, and the new progeny prepares for exile.</P>
<P>While there is room enough in the hive, the bees remain quietly together; it is necessity alone that compels the separation. Sometimes indeed, the young brood, with graceless obsti∣nacy, refuse to depart, and even venture to resist their progenitors. The young ones are known by being browner than the old, with whiter hair; the old ones are of a lighter co∣lour, with red hair. The two armies are there∣fore easily distinguishable, and dreadful battles are often seen to ensue. But the victory al∣most
<PB N="74" REF="030190_0078_0FE50533C6E66738"/>
ever terminates, with strict political just∣ice, in favour of the veterans, and the rebellious offspring are driven off, not without loss and mutilation.</P>
<P>In different countries, the swarms make their appearance at different times of the year, and there are several signs previous to this intended migration. The night before, an unusual buz∣ing is heard in the hive; in the morning, though the weather be soft and inviting, they seem not to obey the call, being intent on more important meditations within. All labour is discontinued in the hive, every bee is either employed in forcing, or reluctantly yielding a submission; at length, after some noise and tumult, a queen bee is chosen, to guard, ra∣ther than conduct, the young colony to other habitations, and then they are marshalled with∣out any apparent conductor. In less than a mi∣nute, they leave their native abode, and form∣ing a cloud round their protectress, they set off, without seeming to know the place of their destination; <HI>The world before them, where to choose their place of rest.</HI> The usual time of swarming, is from ten in the morning, to three in the afternoon, when the sun shines bright, and invites them to seek their fortunes. They flutter for a while, in the air, like flakes of snow, and sometimes undertake a distant jour∣ney, but more frequently are contented with some neighbouring asylum; the branch of a tree, a chimney top, or some other exposed sit∣uation. It is, indeed, remarkable, that all those animals, of whatever kind, that have long been under the protection of man, seem
<PB N="75" REF="030190_0079_0FE504B9F0978788"/>
to lose a part of their natural sagacity, in pro∣viding for themselves. The rabbit, when do∣mesticated, forgets to dig holes, the hen to build a nest, and the bee to seek a shelter, that shall protect it from the inclemencies of winter. In those countries, where the bees are wild, and unprotected by man, they are always sure to build their waxen cells in the hollow of a tree; but with us, they seem im∣provident in their choice, and the first green branch that stops their flight, seems to be thought sufficient for their abode through win∣ter. However, it does not appear, that the queen chooses the place where they are to alight, for many of the stragglers, who seem to be pleased with a particular branch, go and settle upon it; others are seen to succeed, and at last, the queen herself, when she finds a sufficient number there before her, goes to make it the place of her head quarters. When the queen is settled, the rest of the swarm soon follow; and, in about a quarter of an hour, the whole body seem to be at ease. It sometimes is found, that there are two or three queens to a swarm, and the colony is divided into parties; but it most usually happens, that one of these is more considerable than the other, and the bees by degrees, desert the weakest, to take shelter under the most powerful protector. The de∣serted queen does not long survive this defeat; she takes refuge under the new monarch, and is soon destroyed by her jealous rival. Till this cruel execution is performed, the bees ne∣ver go out to work; and if there should be a queen-bee, belonging to the new colony, left
<PB N="76" REF="030190_0080_0FE5053553A5C518"/>
in the old hive, she always undergoes the fate of the former. However, it must be observed, that the bees never sacrifice any of their queens, when the hive is full of wax and honey; for there is at that time, no danger in maintaining a plurality of breeders.</P>
<P>When the swarm is thus conducted to a place of rest, and the policy of government is settled, the bees soon resume their former labours.</P>
<P>When a hive sends out several swarms in the year, the first is always the best, and the most numerous. These, having the whole summer before them, have the more time for making wax and honey, and consequently their labours are the most valuable to the proprietor. Al∣though the swarm chiefly consists of the young∣est bees, yet it is often found, that bees of all ages compose the multitude of emigrants, and it often happens, that bees of all ages are seen remaining behind. The number of them is always more considerable than that of some po∣pulous cities, for sometimes upwards of forty thousand are found in a single hive. So large a body may well be supposed to work with great expedition; and in fact, in less than twenty four hours, they will make combs above twenty inches long, and seven or eight broad. Some∣times they will half fill their hives with wax, in less than five days. In the first fifteen days, they are always found to make more wax than they do afterwards during the rest of the year.</P>
<P>Having mentioned the industry of these ad∣mirable insects, it will be proper to say some∣thing of the effects of their labour, of that wax and honey, which are turned by man to such
<PB N="77" REF="030190_0081_0FE504BB7AC10FB8"/>
various uses. Bees gather together two kinds of wax, one coarse and the other fine. The coarser sort is bitter, and with this, which is called <HI>propolis,</HI> they stop up all the holes and crevices of their hives. It is of a more resinous nature than the fine wax, and is consequently better qualified to resist the moisture of the season, and preserve the works warm and dry within. The fine wax is as necessary to the animals preservation as the honey itself. With this they make their lodgings, with this they cover the cells of their young, and in this they lay up their magazines of honey. This is made, as has been already observed, from the dust of flowers, which is carefully kneaded by the lit∣tle insect, then swallowed, and having under∣gone a kind of digestion, is formed into the cells, which answers such a variety of purposes. To collect this, the animal rolls itself in the flower it would rob, and thus takes up the ve∣getable dust with the hair of its body. Then carefully brushing it into a lump, with its fore∣paws it thrusts the composition into two cavi∣ties behind the thighs, which are made like spoons to receive the wax, and the hair that lines them, serves to keep it from falling.</P>
<P>As of wax, there are also two kinds of ho∣ney. The white and the yellow. The white is taken without fire from the honey-combs. The yellow is extracted by heat, and squeezed through bags, in a press. The best honey is new, thick and granulated, of a clear transpa∣rent white colour, of a soft and aromatic smell, and of a sweet lively taste. Honey made in mountainous countries, is preferable to that of
<PB N="78" REF="030190_0082_0FE50536DD0736A0"/>
the valley. The honey made in the spring, is more highly esteemed, than that gathered in summer, which last is still more valuable, than that of autumn, when the flowers begin to fade and lose their fragrance.</P>

<HEAD>Of the SILKWORM.</HEAD>
<P>THIS little creature, which only works for itself, has been made of the utmost service to man; and furnishes him with a cover∣ing more beautiful than any other animal can supply. We may declaim indeed against the luxuries of the times, when silk is so generally worn; but were such garments to fail, what other arts could supply their deficiency?</P>
<P>Though silk was anciently brought in small quantities to Rome, yet it was so scarce as to be sold for its weight in gold; and was consi∣dered as such a luxurious refinement in dress, that it was infamous for a man to appear in ha∣bits of which silk formed but half the compo∣sition. It was most probably brought among them from the remotest parts of the east; since it was, at that time of which I am speaking, scarcely known even in Persia.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more remote from the truth, than the manner in which their historians de∣scribe the animal by which silk is produced. Pausanius informs us, that silk came from the country of the Seres, a people of Asiatic Scy∣thia;
<PB N="97" REF="030190_0083_0FE504BD2997B480"/>
in which place an insect, as large as the beetle, but in every other respect resembling a spider, was bred up for that purpose. They take great care, as he assures us, to feed and defend it from the weather; as well during the summer's heat, as the rigours of winter. This insect, he observes, makes its web with its feet, of which it has eight in number. It is fed, for the space of four years, upon a kind of paste, prepared for it; and at the beginning of the fifth, it is supplied with leaves of the green willow, of which it is particularly fond; it then feeds till it bursts with fat: after which they take out its bowels, which are spun into the beautiful manufacture so scarce and costly.</P>
<P>The real history of this animal was unknown among the Romans till the times of Justinian; and it is supposed, that silkworms were not brought into Europe till the beginning of the twelfth century; when Roger of Sicily, brought workmen in this manufacture from Asia Minor, after his return from his expedition to the Ho∣ly Land, and settled them in Sicily and Cala∣bria. From these the other kingdoms of Eu∣rope learned this manufacture; and it is now one of the most lucrative carried on among the southern provinces of Europe.</P>
<P>The silkworm is now very well known to be a large caterpillar, of a whitish colour, with twelve feet, and producing a butterfly of the moth kind. The cone on which it spins, is formed for covering it while it continues in the aurelia state; and several of these properly wound off, and united together, form those strong and beautiful threads, which are woven into
<PB N="80" REF="030190_0084_0FE50543181C60E8"/>
silk. The feeding these worms, the gathering, the winding, the twisting, and the weaving their silk, is one of the principal manufactures of Europe; and, as their luxuries increase, seems every day to become more and more necessary to human happiness.</P>
<P>There are two methods of breeding silk∣worms; for they may be left to grow, and re∣main at liberty upon the trees where they are hatched; or they may be kept in a place built for that purpose, and fed every day with fresh leaves. The first method is used in China, Tonquin, and other hot countries; the other is used in other places where the animal has been artificially propagated, and still continues a stranger. In the warm climates, the silk∣worm proceeds from an egg, which has been glued by the parent moth upon proper parts of the mulberry-tree, and which remains in that situation during the winter. The manner in which they are situated and fixed to the tree, keeps them unaffected by the influence of the weather; so that those frosts which are severe enough to kill the tree, have no power to in∣jure the silkworm.</P>
<P>The insect never proceeds from the egg till Nature has provided it a sufficient supply; and till the budding leaves are furnished, in suf∣ficient abundance, for its support. When the leaves are put forth, the worms seem to feel the genial summons, and bursting from their little eggs, crawl upon the leaves, where they feed with a most voracious appetite. Thus they become larger by degrees; and after some months feeding, they lay, upon every leaf,
<PB N="81" REF="030190_0085_0FE504CA71E521E0"/>
small bundles, or cones of silk, which appear like so many golden apples, painted on a fine green ground. Such is the method of breed∣ing them in the East; and without doubt it is best for the worms, and least troublesome for the feeder of them. But it is otherwise in the colder European climates; the frequent chan∣ges of the weather, and the heavy dews of the evenings render the keeping them all night ex∣posed, subject to so many inconveniences, as to admit of no remedy. It is true, that by the assistance of nets, they may be preserved from the insults of birds; but the severe cold weather, which often succeeds the first heats of summer, as well as the rain and high winds, will destroy them all: and therefore, to breed them in Europe, they must be sheltered and protected from every external injury.</P>
<P>For this purpose, a room is chosen, with a south aspect; and the windows are so well gla∣zed, as not to admit the least air: the walls are well built, and the planks of the floor ex∣ceeding close, so as to admit neither birds nor mice, nor even so much as an insect. In the middle there should be four pillars erected, or four wooden posts, so placed as to form a pret∣ty large square. Between these are different stories made with ozier hurdles; and under each hurdle there should be a floor, with an upright border all round. These hurdles and floors must hang upon pullies, so as to be pla∣ced, or taken down at pleasure.</P>
<P>When the worms are hatched, some tender mulberry leaves are provided, and placed in the cloth or paper box in which the eggs were
<PB N="82" REF="030190_0086_0FE50544D09E8058"/>
laid, and which are large enough to hold a great number. When they have acquired some strength, they must be distributed on beds of mulberry leaves, in the different stories of the square in the middle of the room, round which a person may freely pass on every side. They will fix themselves to the leaves, and af∣terwards to the sticks of the hurdles, when the leaves are devoured. They have then a thread, by which they can suspend themselves on occa∣sion, to prevent any shock by a fall; but this is by no means to be considered as the silk which they spin afterwards in such abundance. Care must be taken that fresh leaves be brought every morning, which must be strewed very gently and equally over them; upon which the silkworms will forsake the remainder of the old leaves, which must be carefully taken away, and every thing kept very clean; for nothing hurts these insects so much as moisture and uncleanliness. For this reason their leaves must be gathered when the weather is dry, and kept in a dry place, if it be necessary to lay in a store. As these animals have but a short time to live, they make use of every moment, and almost continually are spinning except at those intervals when they change their skins. If mulberry leaves be difficult to be obtained, the leaves of lettuce or holyoak will sustain them: but they do not thrive so well upon their new diet; and their silk will neither be so copious, nor of so good a quality.</P>
<P>Though the judicious choice, and careful management of their diet, is absolutely neces∣sary, yet there is another precaution of equal
<PB N="83" REF="030190_0087_0FE504CCA6C32820"/>
importance, which is to give them air, and open their chamber windows, at such times as the sun shines warmest. The place also must be kept as clean as possible; not only the seve∣ral floors that are laid to receive their ordure, but the whole apartments in general. These things well observed, contribute greatly to their health and encrease.</P>
<P>The worm, at the time it bursts the shell, is extremely small, and of a black colour; but the head is of a more shining black than the rest of the body: some days after, they begin to turn whitish, or of an ash-coloured grey. After the skin begins to grow too rigid, or the animal is stinted within it, the insect throws it off, and appears cloathed a-new: it then becomes larger and much whiter, though it has a greenish cast: after some days, which are more or less, according to the different heat of the climate, or to the quality of the food it leaves off eating, and seems to sleep for two days together: then it begins to stir, and put itself into violent motions, till the skin falls off the second time, and is thrown aside by the ani∣mal's feet. All these changes are made in three weeks or a month's time; after which it be∣gins to feed once more, still in its caterpillar form, but a good deal differing from itself be∣fore its change. In a few days time it seems to sleep again; and, when it awakes, it again changes its cloathing, and continues feeding as before. When it has thus taken a suffici∣ency of food, and its parts are disposed for as∣suming the aurelia form, the animal forsakes, for the last time, all food and society, and pre∣pares
<PB N="84" REF="030190_0088_0FE4FD063B963DF0"/>
itself a retreat to defend it from external injuries, while it is seemingly deprived of life and motion.</P>
<P>This retreat is no other than its cone, or ball of silk, which Nature has taught it to compose with great art; and within which it buries itself, till it assumes its winged form. This cone or ball is spun from two little long∣ish kinds of bags that lie above the intestines, and are filled with a gummy fluid, of a mari∣gold colour. This is the substance of which the threads are formed; and the little animal is furnished with a surprising apparatus for spinning it to the degree of fineness which its occasions may require. This instrument in some measure resembles a wire-drawer's ma∣chine, in which gold or silver threads are drawn to any degree of minuteness; and through this the animal draws its thread with great assidu∣ity. As every thread proceeds from two gum-bags, it is probable that each supplies its own; which, however, are united, as they proceed from the animal's body. If we examine the thread with a microscope, it will be found that it is flatted on one side, and grooved along its length; from hence we may infer, that it is doubled just upon leaving the body; and that the two threads stick to each other by that gummy quality of which they are possessed. Previous to spinning its web, the silkworm seeks out some convenient place to erect its cell, without any obstruction. When it has found a leaf, or a chink fitted to its purpose, it be∣gins to wreathe its head in every direction, and fastens its thread on every side to the sides of
<PB N="85" REF="030190_0089_0FE504CE358CF430"/>
its retreat. Though all its first essays seem perfectly confused, yet they are not altogether without design: there appears indeed, no or∣der or contrivance in the disposal of its first threads; they are by no means laid artfully over each other, but are thrown out at random, to serve as an external shelter against rain; for nature having appointed the animal to work upon trees in the open air, its habits remain, though it is brought up in a warm apartment.</P>
<P>Malpighi pretends to have observed six dif∣ferent layers in a single cone of silk: but what may easily be observed is, that it is composed externally of a kind of rough cotton-like sub∣stance, which is called floss; within the thread it is more distinct and even; and next the body of the aurelia, the apartment seems lined with a substance of the hardness of paper, but of a much stronger consistence. It must not be supposed, that the thread which goes to com∣pose the cone, is rolled round, as we roll a bottom; on the contrary, it lies upon it in a very irregular manner, and winds off from one side of the cone, and then from the other. This whole thread, if measured, will be found about three hundred yards long; and so very fine, that eight or ten of them are generally rolled off into one by the manufacturers. The cone, when completed, is in form like a pi∣geon's egg, and more pointed at one end than the other; at the smaller end, the head of the aurelia is generally found; and this is the place that the insect, when converted into a moth, is generally seen to burst through.</P>
<P>It is generally a fortnight or three weeks be∣fore
<PB N="86" REF="030190_0090_0FE5054B534B21F8"/>
the aurelia is changed into a moth; but no sooner is the winged insect completely form∣ed, than having divested itself of its aurelia skin, it prepares to burst through its cone, or outward prison: for this purpose it extends its head towards the point of the cone, butts with its eyes, which are rough, against the lining of its cell, wears it away, and at last pushes forward, through a passage which is small at first, but which enlarges as the animal encreases its efforts for emancipation; while the tattered remnants of its aurelia skin lie in confusion within the cone, like a bundle of dirty linen.</P>
<P>The animal, when thus set free from its double confinement, appears exhausted with fatigue, and seems produced for no other pur∣pose but to transmit a future brood. It nei∣ther flies nor eats; the male only seeking the female, whose eggs he impregnates; and their union continues for four days, without inter∣ruption. The male dies immediately after se∣paration from his mate; and she survives him only till she has laid her eggs, which are not hatched into worms till the ensuing spring.</P>
<P>However, there are few of these animals suffered to come to a state of maturity; for as their bursting through the cone destroys the silk, the manufacturers take care to kill the au∣relia, by exposing it to the sun, before the moth comes to perfection. This done, they take off the floss, and throw the cones into warm water, stirring them till the first thread offers them a clue for winding all off. They generally take eight of the silken threads to∣gether; the cones still keep under water, till
<PB N="87" REF="030190_0091_0FE504CFC4BF64A0"/>
a proper quantity of the silk is wound off: however, they do not take all; for the latter parts grow weak, and are of a bad colour. As to the paper-like substance which remains, some stain it with a variety of colours, to make artificial flowers; others let it lie in the water, till the glutinous matter which cements it is all dissolved: it is then carded like wool, spun with a wheel, and converted into silk stuffs of an inferior kind.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF PHILIP QUARLL.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE resources of the human mind in struggling against misfortunes are never so well understood, as in situations of distress and difficulty. Nothing is so
<PB N="95" REF="030190_0099_0FE504EFA87B53B8"/>
feeble, nothing so helpless, as a being that has been ac∣customed to subsist by the labour of others, without the least exertion. This is one of the disadvantages attending a state of refinement and civilization. Mankind forget the simple dictates of reason and nature, and make a thousand pernicious indulgences necessary to their ideas of happiness. One man imagines that it is impossible to transport himself from place to place, without the assist∣ance of other animals, who are to relieve him from the fatigue of using his own legs; another, that it is impos∣sible to supply his hunger without a splendid table, co∣vered with the productions of every climate; a third cannot sleep unless upon beds of down, and in a palace. Thus are a thousand things made necessary to our happi∣ness, which have no natural connexion with it, and our lives are consumed in the acquisition of superfluous tri∣fles. Our vanity, ever ingenious to torment us, ren∣ders us incapable of repose, and prompts us to be con∣tinually making useless comparisons with all around.</P>
<P>Surely, in this respect, the uncultured Savage that inhabits the woods, and asks no more than a skin to repel the winds of winter, an hut to defend him from the storms, and a moderate quantity of the coarsest food, is happier far than we. He views the whole detail of luxury with indifference and contempt, and prefers his native woods and plains to all the magnificence of our cities; nor would the most effeminate native of our cap∣ital be more mortified to inhabit the rudest forests, than he to exchange them for the endless restraints and cere∣monies, which we submit to in civilized society. He sleeps as sound upon a bed of grass and leaves, and gra∣tifies his hunger as satisfactorily with roasted corn, or millet, as a rich and indolent citizen can do with all the accumulated inventions of arts and manufactures. But in the entire possession of all his bodily faculties, how great is the superiority of the Savage! The inhabit∣ant of cities, pale, feeble, and bloated, drags on a tedi∣ous existence with difficulty, under the incumbrance of an hundred diseases, to which his intemperance has
<PB N="96" REF="030190_0100_0FE4FD145649BBF8"/>
subjected him. Before half his life is run out, we fre∣quently behold him incapable of using his limbs; and that idleness, which was at first voluntary, becomes in∣evitable, from the imbecility he has contracted. In vain would the beautiful revolution of the seasons attract his notice, or call him out to share the common blessings which nature dispenses to all her uncorrupted offspring. Neither the care of his own necessary affairs, the defence of his country, nor even fears for his own personal safe∣ty, can any longer animate him to the smallest exertion; and should he not be in a situation to buy the assistance of others, he must remain for ever attached to one spot, like a muscle or an oyster. How different from this is the life of an American Indian, or a Tartar! Accustom∣ed from his infancy to contend with dangers and diffi∣culties, he becomes hardened against all the vicissitudes of nature, against all the attacks of fortune. Wherever the earth extends her surface, he finds a bed; the forest affords him all the shelter he demands; and he can every where procure, by his own industry, sufficient food to supply his wants. In the use of his limbs, and the full enjoyment of all his natural powers, he is not exceeded by the very beasts that fly before him. Such are all the uncivilized nations with which we were formerly ac∣quainted; such are those which are lately added to our knowledge by modern discoveries.</P>
<P>But the most extraordinary instances of the exertions of human beings in difficult situations, are to be found in the lives of such men, as have been compelled by shipwreck to remain for several years on uninhabited islands. Deprived in an instant of all the advantages and support which we derive from mutual assistance, they have been obliged to call forth all the latent resour∣ces of their own minds. From a contemplation of these we are enabled to form some ideas of the wonderful pow∣ers of the human constitution, when properly stimulated to action by necessity. The following narrative, whe∣ther real or fictitious, seems to be admirably adapted to the illustration of this subject, and therefore we shall make no apology for re-printing it in this collection.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF PHILIP QUARLL.</HEAD>
<P>PHILIP QUARLL was an English sailor, who assisted to navigate a ship in the south∣ern seas of America. During his voyage, they were assailed by such a violent tempest, which lasted, without intermission, for two days and nights, that the captain and most experienced mariners began to despair of the safety of the ship. In this exigency, Quarll, being bold and active, took a hatch∣et in his hand, and ran up the shrouds, by the captain's order, to cut away the main∣yard, which they could not lower; but by the time he had mounted, there came a sea, which dashed the ship against a rock, and, with the violence of the motion, flung Quarll, who was astride upon the main∣yard, on the top of the rock, where, hav∣ing
<PB N="98" REF="030190_0103_0FE50564D7A89078"/>
the good fortune to fall into a clift, he was secured from being washed back again into the sea and drowned, as all the rest were that belonged to the ship.</P>
<P>Quarll, in a dismal condition, remained the succeeding night in the clift, being continually beaten with the dashing back of the sea, and being both bruised and numb∣ed, pulled off his cloaths, which were drip∣ping wet, over fatigued, lays himself down on the smoothest place of the rock he could find, being quite spent with the hardship he had undergone, and slept while his cloaths were drying.</P>
<P>His sleep, though very profound, was not refreshing: the danger he had been lately in, so ran in his mind, that death was ever before his eyes, and constantly disturbed his rest: but nature, which wanted repose, would be supplied. Having slept a few hours, he awakes almost as much fatigued as before, and faint for want of nourish∣ment, having taken none for thirty-six hours before: so, having looked upon his cloaths, which he perceived were not quite dry, he turned the other side to the sun, and laid himself down to sleep again: but still nothing but horror entered his mind.</P>
<P>When he awoke, he was very much ter∣rified with his dreams, and stared about him in a frighted manner, expecting every mi∣nute some creature to devour him; but, taking a little courage, put on his cloaths, which by this time were quite dry. He then looks about him; but, alas! could see
<PB N="99" REF="030190_0104_0FE505666339F990"/>
nothing but the dreadful effects of the late tempest; dead corpses, broken planks, and battered chests floating; and such sights as at once filled him with terror and grief.</P>
<P>Turning from those shocking objects, which presented to his eyes the dreadful death he so lately had escaped, he sees on the other side, the prospect of one more terrible, hunger and thirst, attended with all the miseries that can make life burthen∣some. Being seized with the terror of the threatening evil, he turns again towards the sea, and looking on the dead corpses, which the sea now and then drove to the rock, and back again, <Q>Oh! that I was like one of you, said he, past all dangers! I have shared with you in the terrors of death: why did I not also partake with you in its relief? But why should I com∣plain? and have so much reason to be thankful! Had I been cut off, when the cares of saving this worthless carcase in∣tercepted me from seeking the salvation of my soul, I should not have had the pre∣sent opportunity of taking care of it.</Q> So, having returned thanks for his late de∣liverance, he resigns himself to Providence, on whom he fully relies; climbs up the rock, and being come to the top, sees land on the inside, bearing both trees and grass: <Q>Hea∣ven be praised! said he: I shall not perish upon these barren rocks:</Q> so made a shift to go down to it, the weather then being calm.</P>
<P>Being come to the other side of the rock,
<PB N="100" REF="030190_0105_0FE50569ABA98D20"/>
he finds at the bottom of it a narrow lake, which separated it from the land: there∣fore, pulling off his cloaths, the water be∣ing but shallow, he wades over with them in his arms; and dressing himself, walks up a considerable way in the island, without seeing any human creature, or perceiving any sign of its being inhabited, which struck a great damp to his spirits. He walks it over and over, cross-ways and long-ways; yet could see nothing but monkeys, strange beasts, birds, and fowls, such as he had never seen before.</P>
<P>Having ranged himself weary, he sat down under a cluster of trees, that made an agreeable arbour. The place being plea∣sant and cool, made, as it were, for repose, and he being still very much fatigued, prompted him to lie down and sleep, during which, his mind is continually alarmed with the frightful aspect of grim death. Some∣times, he fancies himself striving with the rolling waves, stretching out his arm to catch hold of a plank tossing by; which, just come at, is beaten back by the roaring billows, whose terrible noise pronounces his death. At other times, he thinks him∣self astride upon a piece of a mast, labouring to keep himself on, and of a sudden washed away, and sunk down by a bulkey wave; on every side of him men calling for help; others spent and past speaking; here some floating that are already perished, and there others expiring; thus, in every object, see∣ing his approaching fate.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="030190_0106_0FE505735BCB14F0"/>
Being awaked out of that irksome and uneasy sleep, he falls into as anxious and melancholy thoughts: <Q>I have, said he, escaped being drowned, but how shall I avoid starving? here is no food for man. But why should I despair? Cannot I eat grass for a few days? by which time, Providence, which has hitherto protect∣ed me, may raise me some means to get from hence.</Q> So, being entirely resigned, he walks about to see the island, which he found surrounded with rocks, at the bot∣tom of which there was a small lake, which was fordable in most places, so that he could with ease wade over to the rock; which he did at every side of the island, to see if he could perceive any ship, whereby he might get away: but, seeing none, and it draw∣ing towards night, he returns, and employs the remainder of the day in looking for the most convenient place for him to pass away the approaching night; and, having fixed upon one of the highest trees, he gets up as far as he well could, fearing some wild beast might devour him if he slept below; where, having returned thanks to Heaven for his late great deliverance, he commits himself to its care; then settles, and falls to sleep, and slept till hunger awaked him in the morning, having dreamt over night of abundance of victuals, which he would fain have come at, but was kept off by a cross cook, who bid him go and fish for some. To which he answered, that he was ship-wrecked, and had nothing to fish withal.
<PB N="102" REF="030190_0107_0FE50574E51FC8C0"/>
"Well then," said the cook to him again, <Q>go where thou wast like to lose thy life, and there thou shalt find wherewithal to support it.</Q></P>
<P>Being awaked, he makes reflexions upon his dream, which he imagined might pro∣ceed from the emptiness of his stomach, be∣ing customary for people to dream of vic∣tuals when they go to bed hungry. But, driven by necessity, and led by curiosity, he went to the same side of the rock he had been cast upon; where, having stood several hours without seeing shipping, or aught that might answer his dream, the air com∣ing from the sea being pretty sharp, and he faint, having taken no manner of food for near three days, he gave over all hopes of relief. Thus submitting himself to the will of Heaven, which he supposed decreed a lingering death to punish him for his past sins, he resolves to return where he lay the night before, and there wait for his doom; but being stopped by a sudden noise which issued from a creek in the rock, not far from where he stood, he had the curiosity to go and see what occasioned it.</P>
<P>Being come to the place he heard the noise proceed from, he sees a fine large cod∣fish, near six feet long, dabbling in a hole in the rock, where the late storm had cast it.</P>
<P>One under condemnation of death, and just arrived at the place of execution, could not be more rejoiced at the coming of a re∣prieve, than he was at the sight of this fish, having felt several sick qualms, fore-runners
<PB N="103" REF="030190_0108_0FE505766E6C1FF0"/>
of the death he thought he was doomed to. <Q>Heaven be praised! said he, here is subsistance for several days!</Q></P>
<P>So, having taken off both his garters, he gets into the hole where the fish lay, and having run them through its gills, he hauls it out, and drags it after him, being heavy, and he very weak. Going along, he finds several oysters, muscles, and cockles, in his way, which the sea had cast up and down the rock; and having a knife about him, he sat down and ate a few; so refreshed himself, his spirits being exhausted for want of food. This small nutriment very much recruited his decayed strength, and the thoughts of his supply of provision having dispersed the dull ideas his late want had bred in his mind, he cheerfully takes his fish, which he drags with much more vigour than before; and filling his pocket with salt that was congeal∣by the sun, which he found in the concavi∣ties of the rock, away he goes to the place where he lay the night before, in order to dress some of the cod-fish; where being come, he picks up a parcel of dry leaves, and with his knife and a flint struck fire, and kindled them: then getting together a few sticks, made a fire presently, and broiled a slice of his fish; of which he ate so heartily, that it overcame his stomach, being grown weak with fasting. Thus sick, and out of order, he applies to the recourse of the fee∣ble, which was lying down; and having much fatigued and harrassed himself with
<PB N="104" REF="030190_0109_0FE50579C78EC4C8"/>
hauling the heavy fish up and down the rock, he fell asleep until the next morning.</P>
<P>Having slept quietly the remainder of the night, he awoke in the morning pretty fresh and hearty, but anxious about his future destiny; for though he might for a while subsist upon fish, wherewith he might be supplied by the sea, yet he could not ima∣gine which way he could be furnished with cloaths and bed against the winter; for want of which he must miserably perish with cold, unless supplied by some such dis∣mal accident as exposed him to the want thereof, which he heartily wishes and prays may never happen.</P>
<P>Having made these considerations, he, on his knees, returns kind Providence his hearty thanks for all its mercies that had been extended to him; begging the conti∣nuance of its assistance. Then, watching the opportunity of getting away from that melancholy place, he goes to the other side of the rock, to try if he could perceive any shipping in sight.</P>
<P>The wind being pretty high, fed his hopes, that each succeeding hour would gratify his wishing look, with that object the preceding could not bring forth: but he was disappointed. The night approach∣ing, kept back all probability for that time; however, depending on better success the next day, he returns whence he came: and being hungry, makes a fire, and broils an∣other slice of the fish, then lays the rest up∣on broad green leaves, and strews salt there∣on
<PB N="105" REF="030190_0110_0FE5058342D99958"/>
to keep it from spoiling, and then goes to rest; and as he lay undisturbed the night before under the trees, and much more easy than at top, he ventured again, committing himself to the care of Providence.</P>
<P>He slept in safety that night; but with the returning morning, all his anxieties were renewed, and he determined to lose no time in providing, as well as he could, for all his necessities. Accordingly, first he begins to think of making himself an house to preserve him from the injuries of the weather: but having nothing to make it of, nor any instrument but a knife, which could be of little service to him, he resolves to go to that part of the rock where he was shipwrecked, to see if he could disco∣ver any thing among the wreck that might be serviceable to him: and therefore takes a branch of a tree along with him, and coming to the place, he strips himself and goes into the water, (the water being low, discovering the tops of several sharp-point∣ed rocks), and gropes along with his staff for sure footing, wading as high as his chin, diving to the bottom frequently, and feel∣ing about with his hands. This he conti∣nued doing for almost two hours, but to no purpose, not daring to go out of his depth; for he well knew that he could do little good there, because he could discover no part of the ship, not so much as the mast, or any of the rigging, but fancied she lay in some deep hole, where it was impossible to get at her.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="030190_0111_0FE505850F0C3410"/>
Thus despairing, and fretting and teaz∣ing himself, he calls to mind that he had a hatchet in his hand when he was cast away, and thought probably it might lie in that clift of the rock into which he was thrown; thither he went, and looking about, per∣ceived something like the handle of a hat∣chet, just above the surface of the water, at the bottom of the rock; and going down to it, took it up; which, to his great joy, proved to be the very thing he wanted.</P>
<P>Having got his tool, he dresses himself, and goes on to the island again, intending to cut down some trees to make himself a hut; looking about, therefore, for the pro∣perest plants, and taking notice of a sort of trees, whose branches, bending to the ground, took root, and became a plant, he thought they might be the fittest for this purpose, and cut a sufficient parcel of them to make his barrack; which was full busi∣ness for him that day.</P>
<P>The next morning, having paid his usual devotion, he walks out again to look for a pleasant and convenient place to make his hut or barrack upon. He walked several hours, and could find none more sheltered from the cold winds than that where he al∣ready lay, being in the middle of the island, well fenced on the north and east sides with trees, which stood very thick. The place being fixed upon, he hews down some trees that grew in his way, and clears a spot of ground about twelve feet square, leaving one tree standing at each corner; and, with
<PB N="107" REF="030190_0112_0FE5058699AC28A8"/>
the young plants he provided the day be∣fore, filled the distance between quite round, setting them about six inches asun∣der, leaving a larger vacancy for the door. His inclosure being made, he bends the branches at the top from both sides, and weaves them across one another, making a cover to it, which being something too thin, he laid other branches over, till they were grown thicker. Having finished the top, he goes about closing the sides; for which purpose, taking large branches, he strips off their small twigs, and weaves them between the plants as they do for sheep-pens, then made a door after the same manner.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>His barrack being finished, which took him up fifteen days hard work, "Now," said he, <Q>here is a house, but where is the
<PB N="108" REF="030190_0113_0FE50589CCA6B178"/>
furniture? This, indeed, may keep the weather from me, but not the cold. The ground on which I do and must lie, is hard, and, doubtless, in the winter, will grow damp, which, with want of cov∣ering, may occasion agues and fevers, the cholic and rheumatism, and twenty racking distempers, which may cause me to repent my having escaped a milder death.</Q></P>
<P>In this great consternation and perplexi∣ty, he goes to see if he could spy any ship∣ping riding within sight of the island. As he was walking along, full of heavy and dull thoughts, which weighed his looks to the ground, he happened to find a sort of high grass, that grows but here and there, round some particular sort of trees, of which he never took notice before. <Q>Hea∣ven be praised! said he, I have found wherewithal to keep my poor body from the ground, whilst I am, by Providence, doomed to remain here.</Q> So passes on, intending at his return to cut down a suffi∣cient quantity of it to make mats that might serve him instead of bed and bed-cloaths.</P>
<P>Having looked himself almost blind, with∣out seeing the least prospect of what he de∣sired, he concludes upon going to cut the grass which he stood in such want of, and spread it to dry, whilst the weather was yet warm. That piece of work kept him employed the remainder of the day, and best part of the succeeding, having nothing but a pocket-knife to cut withal. That work
<PB N="109" REF="030190_0114_0FE5058F0FEDD5C8"/>
being done, wanting a tool to spread and turn his grass, he takes a branch off the next tree, which, having stript of all the small ones about it, all but part of that at the top, made a tolerable fork. Thus, be∣ing equipt for hay-making, he went on with his work; and as he was at it, he saw, at some distance, several monkeys as busy as himself, scratching something out of the ground, which they eat in part upon the spot, and carried the rest to their home.</P>
<P>His hopes that those roots might be for his use, those creatures being naturally dainty, eating nothing but what men may, made him hasten to the place he saw them scratching at, that by the herb they they bear (which they tore off), he might find out the root.</P>
<P>Having, by the leaves which he picked off the ground, found some of the same, he digs them up, and carried them to his barrack; where he broiled a slice of fish, and in the ashes roasted them, which cat something like chesnuts, done in the same manner.</P>
<P>This new found-out eatable much rejoic∣ed him. He returned his hearty thanks to kind Providence, that had put him in a way to provide himself with bread, and that of a most delicious kind. As soon, therefore, as he had dined, he went out on purpose to dig up a good quantity: but, as he was go∣ing to the place where he had taken notice they grew pretty thick, he sees a tortoise, of about a foot over, crawling before him:
<PB N="110" REF="030190_0115_0FE50594654317D0"/>
"Heaven be praised!" said he, <Q>here is what will supply me both with victuals and utensils to dress it in.</Q> He ran, there∣fore, and turned it on its back, to keep it from getting away, whilst he went for his hatchet, that he might cut the bottom shell from the top, in order to make a kettle of the deepest, and a dish of the flat part.</P>
<P>Being tired of cod-fish, he dresses the tor∣toise, an animal seldom eaten but upon ex∣tremity, the flesh thereof often giving the flux: nevertheless, he ventured upon it, and liked it extremely, some part of it eat∣ing very much like veal; which at that time was a very great novelty to him, having eaten no fresh meat for a long time before.</P>
<P>Happening to eat of that part of the tor∣toise which is the most seeding and least hurtful, he was in no wise discomposed; but having boiled it all, he laid by the re∣mainder, to eat now and then between his fish.</P>
<P>Being provided with a boiling utensil, he often had change, by means of those admi∣rable roots so lucikly discovered; some of which he roasted for bread, others he boiled with saltcod. This, in a great measure, miti∣gated his misfortune, and softened the hard∣ship he lay under; so that, seeing but little prospect of changing his present condition, by getting away from thence yet a while, he thinks on means to make it as easy as possi∣ble whilst he remained in it; for, having projected a bed, and taking the grass, which by that time was dry, he falls to work; and
<PB N="111" REF="030190_0116_0FE50595F07741D0"/>
a mat being the thing concluded upon, he twists his hay into ropes, the bigness of his leg; then he cuts a pretty number of sticks, about two feet long, which he drives into the ground, ten in a row, and near four inches asunder, and opposite to them such another row at six or seven feet distance from the first, which made the length of his mat; then having fastened one end of his rope to one of the corner sticks, he brings it round the other corner stick, and so to the next at the other end, till he has laid his frame; then he weaves across shorter ropes of the same, in the manner they make pallions on board ships with old cable ends. When he had finished his mat, he beat it with a long stick, which made it swell up; and the grass being of a soft cottony nature, he had a warm and easy bed to lie on.</P>
<P>The comfort and pleasure he found on his soft mat (being grown sore with lying on the ground for a space of a month or more) so liberally gratified him for the time and labour he had bestowed in making it, that it gave him encouragement to go about ano∣ther, a covering being the next necessary wanted; for though the weather was as yet pretty warm, and he in a great measure sea∣soned by the hardship he had gone through; yet the winter approaching, and the present season being still favourable for him to make provision against it, he goes and cuts more grass, which being made ready for use, he lengthens his loom, to allow for rolling up at one end, instead of a bolster, and makes
<PB N="112" REF="030190_0117_0FE5059953619BE0"/>
it thicker than the first, which he intends, in cold weather, shall lie upon him instead of blankets.</P>
<P>Being provided with the most necessary furniture he wanted, he thinks on more conveniences, resolving to make himself a table to eat his victuals upon, and a chair to sit on. Thus, having cut several sticks a∣bout four feet long, he drives them in a row a little way in the ground, then takes smaller, which he interweaves between; having made the top, he sets it upon four other sticks, forky at the upper end, which he stuck in the ground at one side of his bar∣rack, to the height of a table: this being done, he cuts four more branches, such as he judged would do best for the seat and back of a chair, which he also drove in the ground near his table; and having twisted the branches, which grew to them, with each other, from back to front, and across again, he weaves smaller between, bottom∣ing his seat; which completes the furniture of his habitation.</P>
<P>That care being over, another succeeds, of a far greater moment: <Q>Here is a dwell∣ing, said he, to shelter me from the weather, and a bed to rest this poor body of mine; but where is food to sup∣port it? Here I have subsisted near one month upon a fish, which the same dread∣ful storm, that took away forty lives, sent me to maintain my own. Well, since kind Providence has been pleased to pre∣serve my life preferable to so many, who
<PB N="113" REF="030190_0118_0FE505A453E308B0"/>
fatally perished in that dismal accident, I am bound, in gratitude, to hold it precious; and since my fish is almost gone, and I am not certain of more, I must by degrees bring myself to live upon roots, which I hope will never be wanting, be∣ing the natural product of this island: so I must eat of the small remnant of my fish but now and then, to make it hold out the longer. Dainties or plenty were not allotted for him that was doom∣ed to slavery, but labour and hard living; and, if I meet here the latter, Heaven be praised, I have escaped the worse; I can take my rest, and stand in no dread of any severe inspector or taskmaster.</Q></P>
<P>Now being entirely reconciled to the state of life, Providence, on whom he fully de∣pended, had been pleased to call him to, he resolves to make provision of those ex∣cellent roots; and with his hatchet he cuts a piece of a tree, wherewith he makes a shovel, in order to dig them up with more case: with this instrument he went to the place where he observed they grew thick∣est, which being near the monkeys' quar∣ters, they came down from off their trees in great numbers, grinning as if they would have flown at him; which made him stop awhile. He might, indeed, with the in∣strument in his hand, have killed several, and perhaps dispersed the rest; but would not: "Why," said he, "should I add bar∣barity to injustice? It is but natural and reasonable for all creatures to guard and
<PB N="114" REF="030190_0119_0FE505A624754468"/>
defend their own: this was given them by nature for food, which I am come to rob them of: and since I am obliged to get of them for my subsistence, if I am decreed to be here another season, I will set some in a place distant from theirs for my own use."</P>
<P>Having stood still a considerable time, those animals, seeing he did not go forwards, each went and scratched up for itself, after∣wards retiring; giving him the opportunity to dig up a few for himself: and as he was not come to the place where they grew thick, he laid them in small heaps as he dug them up; while those sly creatures would, whilst he was digging up more, come down from the trees where they stood hid among the leaves, and steal them away; which obliged him to be contented for that time with as many as his pockets would hold, resolving to bring something next time which would contain a larger quantity; and fearing those animals, which are naturally very cunning, should dig them up, and hide them, he comes early the morning follow∣ing to make his provision; and for want of a sack to put them in, he takes his jacket, which he buttons up, and ties at the sleeves; and as he had observed, that every root had abundance of little off-sets hanging at it by small fibres, he pulled off his shirt also, of which he makes another sack, to put them in.</P>
<P>Being naked, all but his breeches, and the day being pretty hot, he thought he had as good pull them off too, and fill them, his
<PB N="115" REF="030190_0120_0FE505A7B1D22298"/>
jacket being but short, and therefore hold∣ing but few; taking, therefore, his bundle in one arm, and having the shovel in the o∣ther hand, he goes to the place he intended to go the day before; and expecting to find the same opposition as he did then, he brought with him some of the roots he had dug up the preceding day, in order to throw them amongst those animals, and so quiet them; but to his great wonder, and as great satis∣faction, those creatures, which the time before had opposed him with noise and of∣fensive motions, let him now pass by quiet∣ly, without offering to meddle with any when dug up, though he had laid them up by heaps in their way, and stood at a con∣siderable distance from them.</P>
<P>This surprising reverence from those creatures set him upon deep reflexions on what could be the cause thereof; whether it might not proceed from the proximity of their shape and his: "but, then," said he, "my stature and colour of skin is so different from theirs, that they cannot but distinguish I am not of their kind: no, it must be a remnant of that awe, entailed by Nature upon all animals, to that most noble and complete master-piece of the creation, call∣ed Man, which, now appearing in the state he was first created in, and undisguised by cloaths, renews an image of that respect he has forfeited by his fatal transgression, which ever since obliged him to hide the beauty of his fabric under a gaudy disguise, which often renders him ridiculous to the rest of
<PB N="116" REF="030190_0121_0FE505A94257CAE0"/>
mankind, and generally obnoxious to all other creatures; making a pride of what he ought to be ashamed of. Well, adds he, since my cloaths bred the antipathy, I will remove that cause, which will suit both the nature of those animals, and my own circumstances." From that time he re∣solves to go naked, till the hardness of the weather obliged him to put something on.</P>
<P>Having picked up a sufficient quantity of off-sets to stock about two acres of land, he returns home, leaving behind him a consi∣derable quantity of roots dug up for those poor animals, who attended him all the time he was at work, without offering to touch one till he was gone.</P>
<P>Being come home, he fixes upon a spot of ground near his habitation, and digs it up as well as he could with his wooden in∣strument, in order to sow his seed; which having compassed in about twenty days, he implores a blessing upon his labour, and leaves it to time to bring it forth. Thus having finished the most necessary work about his barrack, he resolves to take a more particular view of the island, which till then he had not time to do; and take∣ing a long staff in his hand, he walks to the lake, which parts the land from the rock, and goes along the side of it quite round the island, finding all the way new subjects of admiration: on the left hand stood a rampart made of one solid stone, adorned by nature with various forms and shapes, beyond the power of art to imi∣tate;
<PB N="117" REF="030190_0122_0FE505B560888D60"/>
some parts challenging a likeness to a city, and clusters of houses, with here and there a high steeple standing above the other buildings: another place claiming a near resemblance to a distant fleet of ship∣ping, with their respective signals flying, coming into port: farther, it bears compari∣son with the dull remains of some sumptu∣ous edifice, ruined by the often repeat∣ed shocks of time, inciting the beholders to condolence for the loss of its former beauty. At some distance from thence the prospect of a demolished city is represent∣ed to the sight: in another place large stones, like small mountains, laid as it were, a-top of one another, impress the mind with an idea of the tower of Babel; and on the right hand a most pleasant land, covered with beautiful green grass, like chamomile, and here and there a cluster of trees, composing most agreeable groves, amongst a vast number of fine lofty trees, of divers heights and shapes, which stood more distant, whose irregularity added to the delightfulness of the place.</P>
<P>As he was walking on, admiring all these wonderful works of nature, having caught cold (not being used to go naked), he hap∣pened to sneeze opposite to a place in the rock, which hollowed in after the manner of the inside of some cathedral, and was answered by a multitude of different voices issuing from that place. The agreeable∣ness of the surprise induced him to rouse those echoes a second time, by giving a
<PB N="118" REF="030190_0123_0FE505B925496900"/>
loud hem; which was, like his sneezing, repeated in different tones, but all very harmonious; again he hem'd, and was so delighted with the repetition, that he could have spent hours in the hearing of it. <Q>But why should I, said he, waste those melodious sounds, so sit to relate the Al∣mighty's wonderful works, and set forth his praise?</Q> Immediately he sang several psalms and hymns with as much emulation and devotion, as if he had been in company with numbers of skilful and celebrated cho∣risters.</P>
<P>Having spent a considerable time there with much pleasure, he proceeds in his walk, being resolved to make that his place of worship for the future, and attend it twice a day constantly.</P>
<P>About three or four hundred paces far∣ther, having turned on the other side of a jetting out part of the rock, he was stopt a second time by another surprising product of nature; a large stone, growing out of the rock, advancing quite over the lake at the bottom of it, representing something of a human shape, out of the breast whereof issued a fountain of exceeding clear water, as sweet as milk; and, when looked at fronting, was like an antique piece of arch∣itecture, which in old times they built over particular springs; and on the other side appeared as if springing from the nostrils of a sea horse. These three so very different and yet rightly compared likenesses, being offered by one and the same unaltered ob∣ject,
<PB N="119" REF="030190_0124_0FE505BAB50303B0"/>
made him curious to examine what parts of every resemblance helped to make the others; and having spent a considerable time in the examination, he found every thing, which the front had likeness of, was employed in making the side representation, by being in some places shortened, and o∣thers lengthened, according to the point of sight.</P>
<P>Being satisfied about that subject, he en∣ters upon another as puzzling: the bason in which the fountain ran, which was about five yards distant from whence the water did spring, being but about nine feet over every way, without any visible place to evacuate its over complement, and yet keeping the same height, without dashing or running over, although the stream that fell into it ran as big as his wrist. Having a long time searched into the cause, without any satisfaction, he conjectures it must make its way out somewhere under ground; so went on, till he came to the place he had begun his march at, which ended that day's work.</P>
<P>Having been round the island, which, to the best of his judgment. was about ten or eleven miles in circumference, of an oblong form, going in and out in several places, extending from north to south, the south end near twice as broad as the opposite; he resolves to employ the next day in viewing the inside.</P>
<P>So the next morning he walks along the land, which he found very level, covered
<PB N="120" REF="030190_0125_0FE5070F06DAE9D0"/>
with a delightful green grass, and adorned with trees of divers sorts, shapes and height, inhabited with several sorts of curious sing∣ing birds, of various colours and notes, which entertained him with their melodi∣ous harmony. In some places stood a clus∣ter of trees, composing agreeable and de∣lightful groves, proceeding from only one main body, whose lower branches, being come to a certain length, applied to the earth for immediate nourishment, as it were, to ease the old stem that produced them; and so became a plant, and did the same.</P>
<P>Having for some time admired the agree∣ableness and curiosity of the plant, by which nature seemed to give human kind instruc∣tions; and looking about, if perchance he could find any thing in his way for his own proper use, he took along with him a sam∣ple of every different herb he thought might be eatable. Crossing the island in several places, he comes at a most delightful pond, about two hundred yards in length, and one hundred and fifty wide, with fine trees spreading their branchy limbs over its brink, which was surrounded with a beautiful bank, covered with divers kinds of flowers and herbs, so naturally intermixed, which com∣pleted it in ornament and conveniency, as though intended by nature for more than mortal's use.</P>
<P>Having walked several times round it with much pleasure, he sat down a while upon its bank, to admire the clearness of the wa∣ter, through which, to his great comfort,
<PB N="121" REF="030190_0126_0FE505BC44235768"/>
he saw many different sorts of fish, of various sizes, shapes, and colours. <Q>Heaven be praised! said he, here is a stock of fresh water fish to supply me with food, if the sea should fail me.</Q></P>
<P>Being sufficiently diverted with their chasing one another, which were of many beautiful and different colours, and a most delightful scene, he proceeds in his walk, and goes to the south of the island, where he finds another subject of admiration, a noble and spacious wood, whose shades seemed to be made for the abode of peace and pleasure. He walked round it with much delight, which made the time seem short; yet he could guess it to be no less than two miles about.</P>
<P>Having viewed the outside, whose extraor∣dinary agreeableness incited in him an unsur∣mountable desire to get into it, but where he was afraid to venture, lest there might be de∣structive creatures; yet, having recommended himself to the care of Providence, he ventured into it, finding several pleasant walks, some straight, edged with lofty trees, as though plant∣ed for pleasure; others crooked and winding, bordered with a thick hedge of pimentoes, which cast a most fragrant smell; here and there a large cluster of bushes and dwarf trees, wherein sheltered several different kinds of wild beasts and fowls: <Q>Sure, said he, this island never was intended by nature to lie waste, but rather reserved to be the happy abode of some, for whom Heaven had a pe∣culiar blessing in store. Here is every thing sufficient, not only for the support, but also
<PB N="122" REF="030190_0127_0FE505C8D2C7C8F8"/>
for the pleasure of life: Heaven make me thankful, that I am the happy inhabitant of so blessed a land!</Q></P>
<P>Being hungry, and tired with walking, he goes home in order to get some victuals, and having made a fire, he boils a slice of his salt fish with some roots, and then the herbs he brought with him, which proved of divers tastes, and all excellent; some eating like artichoaks, others like asparagus and spinach. <Q>Now, said he, what can I wish for more! Here I possess a plentiful land, which pro∣duces both flesh and fish; bears excellent greens and roots, and affords the best of wa∣ter, which by nature was ordained for man's drink. Pomp and greatness are but pagean∣try, which oftentimes prove more prejudicial to the actor, than diverting to the beholder; ease and indulgence are apt to breed the gout, and various distempers, which make the rich more wretched than the poor; now these evils, thanks to my Maker! I stand in no danger of, having but what is sufficient, which never can do any harm.</Q></P>
<P>Thus thoroughly easy in his mind, he pro∣poses to spend the afternoon at the outside of the rock, in viewing the sea, and looking for oysters; so takes in his hand his long staff to grapple in holes; and his breeches which he ties at the knees, to bring them in. Being come to a place of the rock he had never been at be∣fore, he sees at a distance something like linen hanging upon it, which, when he come at, he found to be the main-sail of a ship, with a piece of the yard fastened to it: "Alas!" said
<PB N="123" REF="030190_0128_0FE505CA861F3AF0"/>
he, <Q>a dismal token of insatiable ambition! which makes men often lose their lives in seeking what they seldom find; and, if they ever do, 'tis commonly attended with a world of care. Happy is he who limits his desires to his ability, aspiring not above his reach, and is contented with what nature requires.</Q> Then he falls a ripping the sheet from the yard, which he finds in one place tied with one of his garters, (having himself made use of it for want of another string) <Q>Heaven be praised! said he, this is no effect of another shipwreck, but a fragment of the unfortunate ship, whose loss was my redemption;</Q> which reflexion made him shed tears.</P>
<P>Having ripped the sail in pieces, he rolls them in such bundles as he could conveniently carry, and lays them down till he had got a few oysters, proceeding to grope in holes with his stick as he went on.</P>
<P>About forty paces farther, he finds a chest in the clift of a rock, which had been washed up there by the violence of the late storm:—<Q>Heaven! said he, more fatal effects of fate's cruelty and man's temerity! Was the sea made for men to travel on? Is there not land enough for his rambling mind to rove? Must he hunt after dangers, and put death to defiance? What is the owner of this the better for it now? Or who can be the better in a place so remote, and the access to it so difficult? being not to be approached but on the wings of Providence, and over the back of death. Now, was this full of massy gold, or yet richer things, I thank my God, I am

above the use of it; yet I'll take it home: it was sent hither by Providence, perhaps for the relief of some so necessitated and desti∣tute.</Q> Then going to lift it, he could not; therefore was obliged to fetch his hatchet to beat it open that he might take away what was in it by degrees. Having taken as much of the sail cloth as he could conveniently carry, with the few oysters he had got, he went home and fetched the tool, wherewith he wrenched the chest open, from which he took a suit of cloaths and some wearing linen: "These," said he, "neither the owner nor I want;" so laid them down; the next thing he took out was a roll of several sheets of parchment, being blank indentures and leases: <Q>These, said he, are instruments of the law, and often applied to injustice; but I'll alter their mis∣chievous properties, and make them records of Heaven's mercies, and Providence's won∣derful liberality to me; so, instead of being the ruin of some, they may chance to be the reclaiming of others.</Q> At the bottom of the chest lay a runlet of brandy, a Cheshire cheese, a leather bottle full of ink, with a parcel of pens, and a penknife: <Q>As for these, said he, they are of use; the pens, ink, and parchment have equipped me to keep a jour∣nal, which will divert and pass away a few anxious hours: as for the cheese and brandy, they will but cause me new cares: before I had them, I wanted them not: now, the be∣nefit and comfort I shall find in them, when gone, will make me hanker after them more, I wish I had still been without them; but now
<PB N="125" REF="030190_0130_0FE505CDDB2D9C70"/>
they are here, it would be a sin to let them be lost. I'll take them home, and only use them at my need; which will both make them hold out the longer, and me grow less fond of them.</Q></P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>So, by degrees, he takes home the chest, and what was in it; and now having materials to begin his journal, he immediately fell to work, that for want of other books, he might, at his leisure, peruse his past transactions, and the many mercies he had received from Heaven; and that, after his decease, whoever is directed thither by Providence, upon reading his won∣derful escapes in the greatest of dangers; his miraculous living, when remote from human assistance; in the extremity, might not despair. Thus he begins from his being eight years old (as well as he can remember, he heard an old aunt of his say) to the day of his being cast
<PB N="126" REF="030190_0131_0FE505D9511D5CE8"/>
away, being then twenty-eight years of age, resolving to continue it to his death.</P>
<P>He now resolves to make provision against winter, and the season being pretty far advanced, he gathers a good store of fuel and roots; be∣gins to line the outside of his barrack with a wall of turf, and lays the same at top, to keep out the wet. And as he now and then found small shell-fish and oysters upon the rock, he makes a bridge over the lake, which in warm weather he used to wade, that in the winter he might go over dry. So, having completed his bridge, which was made of two strong poles, which reached from the land to the rock, and se∣veral lesser-branches laid across pretty close, he retires home, the day being far spent. The following night there arose a violent storm, at∣tended with dreadful claps of thunder, which the many echoes from the rock rendered more terrible; and lightnings flashing in a most frightful manner, succeeding each other, be∣fore the preceding was well out of the sky, which put poor lonesome Quarll in such a con∣sternation, that notwithstanding his reliance on Heaven's protection, he would have given the world (had it been in his possession) to have been within the reach of human assistance; or at least to have had some company; solitude adding much to his terror and affliction.</P>
<P>The glorious rising of the next morning's sun having laid the mortifying rage of the bluster∣ing winds, Quarll, whose late alarm was hardly quelled, still suspecting its most reviving rays to be terrifying glances and flashes of lightning; but having lain awhile, and hearing no noise,
<PB N="127" REF="030190_0132_0FE505DAE95BC0D8"/>
but that which still raged in his mind, was at last convinced the storm was over; and so gets up with a resolution to go and see if he could discern any effect of the late tempest.</P>
<P>Being come at the other side of the rock, he saw indeed surprising objects, but not afflicting; the mischief that was done, being to the inha∣bitants of the sea only, a vast number of which had, by the wind, been diselemented; a quan∣tity of stately whitings, fine mackerels, large herrings, divers sizes of codlings, and several other sorts of fish, with a great number of shells, of different shapes and bignesses, lying up and down upon the rock. <Q>Heaven be praised! said he, instead of damage to bewail, what thanks have I now to return for this mighty benefit! Here the powerful agent of mischief is, by kind Providence, made a minister of good to me: make me thankful! I am now provided for all the next winter; and yet longer; by which time I am certain to have a fresh supply.</Q></P>
<P>Thus having taken up as many fish as he could hold in his arms, he carries them home, and brings his shirt, which he used instead of a sack; so, at several times, he brought away all the fish, and as many of the shells as he had oc∣casion for; of some of which he made boilers and stewpans; of others, dishes and plates; some he kept water in, and others fish in pickle; so that he was stocked with necessary vessels as well as provision.</P>
<P>Being very weary with often going back∣wards and forwards with his fish, which took up all that day to bring them home, he sits
<PB N="128" REF="030190_0133_0FE505DC74470A98"/>
down to rest himself; and the runlet of brandy lying by, he was tempted to take a sup, which was at that time very much wanted, his spirits being very low; but was loth to taste it, lest he should grow fond of the liquor, and grieve after it when gone: some moments were spent before he could come to a resolution; at last, having considered the use of it, which suited the present occasion, he concludes to take a dram, and to use it like a cordial, which it was first intended for; but the vessel out of which he drank, being at his mouth, the cordial turns to a nectar; one gulph decoys another down; so the intended dram became a hearty draught. The pleasantness of the liquor made him forget its nature; so that poor Quarll, who had, for the space of near three months before, drank nothing but water, was presently overcome with the strength of the brandy, and fell asleep in his chair, with the runlet on his bare lap, from whence it soon fell to the ground, and, being unstopt, ran all out.</P>
<P>Being awaked with hunger, having slept from evening till almost noon of another day, which he knew not whether the succeeding or the next to it; seeing what had happened, he was sorely vexed, and could have wept at the accident; but, considering the liquor which occasioned it, might perhaps, in time, have caused greater mischief, he was soon reconciled to the loss, but could not with that of the right order of the days, which having entirely forgot, hindered the going on of his journal; so was obliged to make only a memorial. That da∣mage being repaired, another appears of a far
<PB N="129" REF="030190_0134_0FE505DE033559A0"/>
greater consequence; the Sunday is lost, which he had so carefully observed to that time:—how can that be made up? <Q>Now, said he, shall I daily be in danger of breaking the sabbath, knowing not the day. O fatal li∣quor! that ever thou wert invented to cause so much mischief! But why should I lay the blame upon the use, when it is the abuse that does the hurt? and exclaim against a thing, which being taken in moderation is of so great a benefit, reviving a fainting heart, raising sinking spirits, warming cold and de∣cayed nature, and assuaging several pains.</Q> So blames himself highly for gratifying his ap∣petite with that wherewith he only ought to have refreshed nature; and since that often misguided faculty had prompted him to com∣mit the fault, he dedicated that day, in which he became sensible of it, to prayers and fasting; and every seventh from that he sets apart for divine worship only, which he hoped would keep him from breaking the commandments for keeping holy the sabbath day: so went to the place where the echoes, in many different and melodious sounds, repeated his thanksgiv∣ing to the Almighty, which he had fixed upon to pay his devotion, and there spent the rest of the day in prayers and singing of psalms.</P>
<P>The next morning, having breakfasted with some of his usual bread, and a slice of the cheese he found in the chest, he goes about curing his fish, in order to salt them; having laid by as many, for the present use, as he thought he could eat whilst fresh, he improves
<PB N="130" REF="030190_0135_0FE505EE19866C80"/>
the fair weather, to dry one part of the re∣mainder, and keeps the rest in pickle.</P>
<P>The winter being neat at hand, and the weather growing damp and cold, hinders him from taking his walks; so being confined with∣in doors, he employs his idle hours in beauti∣fying his utensils, which were not to be used on the fire; and bestowed some pains in scrap∣ing and polishing the rest of his shells, some as fine as though they had been nakers of pearl; which made them not only more fit for their intended uses, but also a great ornament to his barrack, which he shelved round with plaited twigs after the manner of his table, and so set them upon it.</P>
<P>Thus he spent the best part of the winter, making no farther remarks, but that it was very sharp, attended with high winds, abun∣dance of nail and snow, which obliged him to make a broom to sweep it away from about his hut, which otherwise would have been damaged by it.</P>
<P>But shivering Winter having exhausted his frosty stores, and weary with vexing nature, re∣tired; Boreas also, grown faint with hard blow∣ing, is forced to retreat into his cave; gentle Zephyrus (who till then kept up in his tem∣perate cell) now comes forth to usher in the blooming spring; so mildly slips on to inform Nature of her favourite's approach, who at the joyful news puts on her gay enamelled garb, and out of her rich wardrobe supplies all vege∣tables with new vesture, to welcome the lovely guest. The feathered choristers also receive new strength; their tender lungs are repaired
<PB N="131" REF="030190_0136_0FE505EFA56AEF08"/>
from the injuries the foggy and misty air did occasion; and, thus revived, are placed on every budding tree, to grace his entrance with their harmonious notes.</P>
<P>Quarll also, whom bad weather had confined within doors a considerable time, which had in a great measure numbed his limbs, and dulled his senses, now finds himself quite revived: he no longer can keep within; the fair weather in∣vites him out; the singing birds on every side call to him; nature itself fetches him out to behold her treasures.</P>
<P>Having with unspeakable pleasure walked some time, diverted with the sweet melody of various singing birds, and the sight of abun∣dance of different sorts of blossomed trees, and blooming flowers; all things within the island inspiring joy; he had the curiosity to go and view the sea; so goes over his bridge; and then, at the other side of the rock, where he finds more objects, requiring as much admiration, but affording a great deal less pleasure; vast mountains of ice, floating up and down, threat∣ning all that came in their way.</P>
<P>These terrible effects of the winter, which to that time he was a stranger to, occasioned his making these reflexions:
<Q><L>He who on billows roves, riches or wealth to gain,</L>
<L>Is ever in danger, and labours oft in vain;</L>
<L>If fortune on him smiles, giving his toil success,</L>
<L>Each day new cares arise, which mar his happiness.</L>
<L>The only treasure then worth laying up in store,</L>
<L>Is a contented mind which never leaves one poor;</L>
<L>He is not truly rich who hankers after more.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="030190_0137_0FE505F12E0D8918"/>
So, having returned Heaven thanks for his happy state, he creeps to the north-east side of the rock, at the foot of which lay an extraor∣dinary large whale, which the late high wind had cast there, and died for want of water. <Q>If this, said he, is all the damage that has been done last winter, it may be borne;</Q> so went down and measured the length of it, which was above thirty yards, and proportionable in bigness: there were shoals of small fishes swim∣ming about it in the shallow water wherein it lay, as rejoicing at its death. <Q>Thus, said he, the oppressed rejoice at a tyrant's fall. What numbers of these have been destroyed to make this monstrous bulk of fat! Well, happy are they, who, like me, are under Heaven's government only.</Q> So with his knife, which he always carried in his pocket, cuts several slices of the whale, and throws them to the small fishes, saying, <Q>It is but just you should at last feed on that which so long fed on you;</Q> as oil ran, in abundance, from the places he had cut the slices out of, it vexed him to see that wasted, which might turn to good money: <Q>But why, said he, should I be disturbed at it? What use have I for any? Providence takes none, it gives me all gratis.</Q> So goes on feeling for oysters with his staff, which he always walked with.</P>
<P>Having at last found a hole, where by their rattling at the bottom with his staff, he judged there might be a pretty many, he marks the place, and goes home to contrive some instru∣ment to drag them up, being yet too cold for him to go in the water; and as he had no tool
<PB N="133" REF="030190_0138_0FE505F2C0AE6488"/>
but his knife and hatchet, both improper to make a hole in a board, as requisite to make a rake, which was wanting for that purpose; he beats out the end of his chest, in which there was a knot: so having driven it out, he fastens the small end of a pole to it. Thus equipped, he went and raked up oysters, which added one dish to his ordinary, and sauce to others; yet at length his stomach growing qualmish with eating altogether fish, and drink∣ing nothing but water withal, he wishes he could have a little flesh, which he might easily, there being animals enough in the wood apparently fit for food; but then he must deprive them of their lives, barely to make his own more easy.</P>
<P>Thus he debates with himself for some time, whether or no it would not be injustice for him (who only by a providential accident was brought thither to save his life) now to destroy those creatures, to whom nature had given a being, in a land out of man's reach to disturb: yet nature requires what seems to be against na∣ture for me to grant: I am faint, and like to grow worse, the longer I abstain from flesh.</P>
<P>Having paused a while; <Q>Why, said he, should I be so scrupulous? Were not all things created for the use of man? Now, whether it is not worse to let a man perish, than to destroy any other creature for his re∣lief? Nature craves it, and Providence gives it: now, not to use it in necessity, is under∣valuing the gift.</Q></P>
<P>So, having concluded upon catching some of those animals he had seen in the wood, he con∣siders by what means, having no dogs to hunt,
<PB N="134" REF="030190_0139_0FE506009FC98320"/>
nor guns to shoot. Having paused awhile, he resolves upon making gins, wherewith he had seen hares catched in Europe: thus, taking some of the cords which he found with the sail at the outside of the rock, he goes to work, and makes several, which he fastens at divers gaps in the thickset, within the wood, through which he judged that sort of beast, he had a mind for, went.</P>
<P>Impatient to know the success of his snares, he gets up betimes the next morning, and goes to examine them; in one he found a certain animal something like a fawn, the colour of a deer, but feet and ears like a fox, and as big as a well-grown hare. He was much rejoiced at his game, whose mouth he immediately opened, to see if he could find out whether it fed upon grass, or lived upon prey: the crea∣ture being caught by the neck, and strangled with struggling, before it died, had brought up in its throat some of the greens it had been eating, which very much pleased him; ac∣counting those which lived upon flesh as bad as carrion.</P>
<P>Having returned thanks for his good luck, he takes it home in order to dress part of it for his dinner; so cases and guts it: but it proving to be a female, big with three young ones, grieved him to the heart, and made him repent making those killing nooses. <Q>What pity, said he, so many lives should be lost, and creatures wasted! One would have served me four days; and here are four killed at once. Well, henceforth, to prevent the like evil, I will take alive what I just want and
<PB N="135" REF="030190_0140_0FE506036E059208"/>
save all the females.</Q> So, having stuck a long stick at both ends in the ground, making a half circle, he hangs one quarter of the ani∣mal upon a string before a good fire, and so roasts it.</P>
<P>His dinner being ready, having said grace, he set to eating with an uncommon appetite; and, whether it was the novelty of the dish, or that the meat did justly deserve the praise, he really thought he never eat any thing of flesh, till then, comparable to it, either for taste or tenderness.</P>
<P>Having dined both plentifully and deliciously, he most zealously returns kind Providence thanks for the late, and all favours received; then pursuant to his resolution, he goes to making nets, in order to take his game alive for the future; and, as he had no small twine to make it with, he was obliged to unravel some of the sail which he luckily had by him; and with the thread, twisted some of the bigness he judged proper for that use.</P>
<P>Having made a sufficient quantity, he makes a couple of nets, about four feet square, which he fastens in the room of the killing snares; so retired, and resolved to come and examine them every morning.</P>
<P>Several days passed without taking any thing, so that he wanted flesh for a whole week, which did begin to disorder his stomach, but not his temper; being entirely resigned to the will of Providence, and fully contented with whatever Heaven was pleased to send.</P>
<P>One afternoon, which was not his customary time of day to examine his nets, being too vi∣sible
<PB N="136" REF="030190_0141_0FE5060540DA2B90"/>
in the day-time for game to run in; he happened to walk in the wood, to take the full dimensions thereof, so chanced to go by his nets; in one of which were taken two animals, as big as a kid six weeks old, of a bright dun, their horns upright and straight, their shape like a stag, most curiously limbed, a small tuft of hair on each shoulder and hip. By their horns, which were but short, they appeared to be very young, which rejoiced him the more, being in hopes to tame those which he did not want for present use; so carried them home joy∣ful of his game, depending upon a good din∣ner; but was sadly disappointed: the animals he found were antelopes (calling to mind he had seen them in his travels,) which proving both females, he had made a resolution to pre∣serve. Though they were too young to be with kid, and he in great need of flesh, yet he would not kill them; so with cords fastens them to the outside of his lodge; and with constant feeding them, in two months time made them so tame, that they followed him up and down; which added much to the pleasure he already, took in his habitation, which by that time was covered with green leaves, both top and sides; the stakes it was made of having struck root, and shot out young branches, whose strength increasing that summer; to fill up the vacancy between each plant, he pulled the turfs, wherewith he had covered the outside and top of the hut between them, to keep the cold out in the winter.</P>
<P>His former hut, being now become a plea∣sant arbour, gave him encouragement to be∣stow
<PB N="137" REF="030190_0142_0FE50606E2E62888"/>
some pains about it towards the embellish∣ment of it, which seemed to depend on being well attended. He resolved upon keeping it pruned and watered, the better to make it grow thick and fast, which answered his intent; for in three years time, the stems of every plant that composed the arbour, were grown quite close, and made a solid wall of about six inches thick, covered with green leaves without, which lay most regular and even, and within had a most agreeable smooth bark, of a pleasant olive colour.</P>
<P>His late arbour being, by his care and time, and nature's assistance, become a matchless lodge, as intended by nature for something more than human guests, he now consults to make it as commodious as beautiful. <Q>Here is, said he, a delightful dwelling, warm in the winter, and cool in the summer; delight∣ful to the eye, and comfortable to the body; pity it should be employed to any use, but repose and delight!</Q> So resolved upon mak∣ing a kitchen near it. Thus having fixed upon a place convenient at the side of his lodge, about six feet from it, twelve in length, and eight in breadth, which he inclosed with the turfs that covered the outside of his arbour, be∣fore it was sufficiently thick to keep out the cold; then having laid sticks across the top of the walls, which were about eight feet high, he lays turf thereon, and so covers it, leaving an open place for the smoke to go out.</P>
<P>The outside being done, he goes about in∣side necessaries, as fire-places to roast and boil at; thus cuts a hole in the ground, at a small
<PB N="138" REF="030190_0143_0FE5060F3A776C28"/>
distance from the wall, after the manner of stew∣stoves in noblemen's kitchens; then, at another place, he sets two flat stones, about eight or nine inches broad, and one foot long, edge∣ways, opposite to one another, near two feet asunder; then puts a third in the same manner, at the end of the other two; so makes a fire∣place fit to roast at: then, for other conveni∣ences, he weaves twigs about sticks, stuck in the wall on one side of the kitchen, where he lays the shells fit for utensils, which both adorn∣ed and furnished it.</P>
<P>Having completed that piece of work, he goes and visits his plantations, which he finds in a thriving condition; the roots being, in six months time, grown from the bigness of a pea (as they were when first set) to that of an egg: his antelopes were also come to their full growth and complete beauty, which exceeded most four footed beasts, having a majestic pre∣sence, body and limbs representing a stag, and the noble march of a horse: so every thing concurred to his happiness. For which having returned his most liberal benefactor his grateful acknowledgements, he thinks on means to pre∣vent any obstructions that may intercept the continuation thereof; and as the want of cloaths was the only cause he could think of to make him uneasy, having but the jacket and hose which were given him on board, to save his own cloaths, which when worn out he could not recruit; therefore, to accustom himself to go without, he lessens those he had, and takes away the lining from the outside, in order to wear the thickest in the coldest weather, and
<PB N="139" REF="030190_0144_0FE50617DF0F2818"/>
so thins his dress by degrees, till at last he went quite naked.</P>
<P>Having thus concluded, as being the best shift necessity could raise him, he falls to rip∣ping his jacket, in the lining whereof he finds seven peas and three beans, which were got in at a hole at the corner of the pocket.</P>
<P>Those few made him wish for more, which he had no room to hope for, they being raised by seed, which the island did not produce: <Q>These few, said he, which at present are hardly sufficient to satisfy a woman's longing, may, with time and industry, be improved to a quantity large enough to serve me for a meal;</Q> then lays them up against a proper time to set them; so spent the remainder of that summer in walking about the island, watering his lodge, weeding his root plantation, attend∣ing his nets, which now and then supplied him with an antelope or goat, to eat at intervals between fish he commonly found on the rock after high winds and storms; never failing to visit the sea three or four times a week, ac∣cording as the weather did prove; thus divert∣ing many anxious hours with the variety of ob∣jects that element affords. Sometimes he had the pleasure of seeing great whales chasing one another, spouting large streams of water out of their gills and nostrils; at other times, num∣bers of beautiful dolphins rolling amongst the waves; now and then a quantity of strange monstrous fish playing on the surface of the sea, some whereof had heads (not common to fishes) like those of hogs; others not unlike those of dogs, calves, horses, lions, bulls,
<PB N="140" REF="030190_0145_0FE5061993E33790"/>
goats, and several other creatures: some chasing another sort; which, to avoid being taken, would quit their element, and seek refuge in the air, and fly some yards above the water; till their fins being dry, obliged them to plunge in again.</P>
<P>These pastimes being generally succeeded with bad weather, and dreadful storms, checked the pleasure they gave, with a dread of the evil that threatened to follow. Thus com∣miserating the case of those whose misfortune is to be exposed to them; having spent some time in reflexion, he goes to his usual devotion, and calling to mind, that in all that time he never saw a young fish in the pond, he con∣jectured that something might destroy the small ones; and as he imagined so it proved: for at his approach, a large fowl flew out of the pond with a fish in its bill, being too large for it to swallow.</P>
<P>At that distance, the bird being also upon the wing, he could neither discern colour nor make; but he had the satisfaction of discover∣ing the cause why the fishes did not increase, they being devoured when young by that crea∣ture; which to prevent for the future, he studies means to kill the destroyer; nets not being pro∣per instruments, it being requisite, for that purpose, to have one all round, as also to cover the pond, which was impossible by reason of its largeness; and a less being of no use, the birds probably not coming to one certain place. He wished for a gun and ammunition fitting, as being the most probable things to succeed; but no such instrument being within his reach,
<PB N="141" REF="030190_0146_0FE5061B1E721140"/>
he ponders again; during which time, a cross∣bow offers itself to his mind, but is as distant from his reach as the gun. It is true, there was stuff enough in the island to make many, but no tools except a hatchet and pocket knife, wherewith, if he made shift to cut and shape a bow, he could not make a latch and spring ne∣cessary to it; so he must not think on it: yet a bow being the only thing he could apply to, he goes about one forthwith. Thus having picked a branch of a tree, which had the re∣semblance of yew, and as tough, of which they are sometimes made, he, with the tools he had, made a shift to make one about six feet long, and arrows of the same, which he hardens and straightens over the fire; then having slit them at one end, about two or three inches, he slips in a bit of parchment, cut sharp at one end, and about three inches at the other, then ties the end close, to keep it in, which served for
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="142" REF="030190_0147_0FE506248CF9F5E0"/>
feathers; and, with the ravelling of some of the sail, he makes a string to it.</P>
<P>Thus equipped for an archer, wanting no∣thing but skill, which is only to be gained by practice, he daily exercises shooting at a mark for the space of a fortnight; in which time he made such an improvement, that at three shots he would hit a mark of about three inches square, at near fifty paces distance.</P>
<P>Being sufficiently skilled, he goes and lies in wait for his desired game; so placed himself behind a tree, as near the pond as he could, whither the bird came in a few hours after.</P>
<P>The creature being pitched upon the bank, never stood still, but kept running round, watching for a sizeable fish fit to swallow; so that he had no opportunity to shoot; till having at last, espied out one, it launched itself into the pond, but rose more slowly, which gave him time to take aim; nevertheless, he missed it, being in motion; but when come to the top, he struck it through the body as it opened its wings, and laid it flat on the other side of the pond. He took it up, wonderfully pleased at his good success the first time of his practising his new acquired art; yet, having taken no∣tice of the bird's beauty, he had a regret for its death, though he might, in time, have rued its living; the stock of fish weekly decreasing, by his own catching one now and then with a small net he made for that use, when short of other provisions, and their recruiting prevented by that bird's daily devouring their young.</P>
<P>The inexpressible beauty of the feathers, which were after the nature of a drake, every
<PB N="143" REF="030190_0148_0FE5062755B40BA8"/>
one distinguished from another by a rim round the edge thereof, about the breadth of a large thread, and of a changeable colour from red to aurora and green; the ribs of a delightful blue, and the feathers pearl colour, speckled with a bright yellow; the breast and belly (if it might be said to be of any particular colour) was that of a dove's feather rimmed like the back, diversly changing; the head, which was like that of a swan for make, was purple also, changing as it moved; the bill like burnished gold; eyes like a ruby, with a rim of gold round it; the feet the same as the bill; the size of the bird was between a middling goose and a duck, and in shape resembling a swan.</P>
<P>Having bemoaned the death of that delight∣ful creature, he carefully takes out its flesh, which, corrupting, would spoil the outside; then fills the skin with sweet herbs, which he dried for that use; and having sewed up the place he had cut open to take the flesh out, he set it up in his lodge.</P>
<P>His good success in archery made him love the exercise; so that what odd hours he had in the day (besides those he set apart for his divine worship, and those necessary occupations about his lodge, plantations, and making remarks) he bestowed in shooting at the mark, which in time made him so expert, that he hardly would miss a standing mark the bigness of a dove, at forty or fifty yards distance, once in ten times; and would shoot tolerably well flying, having once occasion to try it upon a monstrous eagle, which often flew round over the place where his antelopes and goats fed, near his lodge,

which he shot at, fearing it would damage them, and killed it with the second arrow.</P>
<P>The summer being over, during which, hav∣ing been much taken up about his habitation and plantations, he had neither time nor op∣portunity to make remarks, farther than it was some days very showery, and for the most part generally very hot; but now the weather being grown something cold, and the wind pretty sharp, he must be obliged to put on some cloaths to keep it off, being as yet too tender to go any longer without; next to provide for his ante∣lopes against the approaching winter; so makes a lodge for them, at the backside of his kitchen, with sticks, which he drove into the ground, about two feet from the wall, and then bends them about three feet from the ground, and slicks them in the said wall, and smaller bran∣ches he interwove between them: he shuts up the front, and covers the top, leaving both ends open for the antelopes to go in at; then lays grass (which he dried on purpose) in the said lodge, for them to lie on. Thus, having dug up a considerable quantity of roots, and being already stocked with salt-fish, both dry and in pickle, he was pretty well provided for his cat∣tle and himself, against the ensuing winter, which proved much like the preceding one, only not so stormy.</P>
<P>The succeeding spring having awaked slum∣bering nature, and revived what the preceding hard season had caused to droop, every vege∣table puts on new cloathing and recovers its wonted beauty; each animal assumes fresh vi∣gour; the beasts in the wood leap and bound
<PB N="145" REF="030190_0150_0FE5062A6BCFCE18"/>
for joy, and each bird on the trees sings for gladness. The whole creation is, as it were, repaired, and every creature decked with new life. Love by Nature's direction, for the in∣crease of every kind, warms their harmless breasts; each animal seeks a mate; our tame antelopes quit their abode, and range the woods for the relief ordained to quell their innocent passion; which being assuaged, they return home, pregnant with young, to their master's great satisfaction; who, having given them over, was doubly rejoiced to see them come a∣gain in an increasing condition. <Q>Heaven be praised! said he, I shall have a stock of my own, and will not fear wanting.</Q></P>
<P>So, having made fitting preparations against their kidding, he goes and examines the im∣provement of his new plantation, where he found his roots grown full as large as any of those that grew wild. <Q>Make me thankful! said he, I am new provided with all necessary food. I shall no more need to rob those poor creatures of that which Nature had pro∣vided for their own proper use.</Q> Next he goes and views his small stock of peas and beans, which he found in a very promising case. So, whilst the weather was fair, he falls to clearing a spot of ground to set them in, as they increased.</P>
<P>Turning up the ground he found several sorts of roots that looked to be eatable, some whereof were as big as a large carrot, others less. He broke a bit of every one, some of which breaking short, and being not stringy, he judged they must be eatable; then he smells
<PB N="146" REF="030190_0151_0FE5063585923560"/>
them, and finding the scent not disagreeable, he tastes them. Some were sweetish, others sharp and hot, like horse-radish; and those he proposes to use instead of spice. <Q>Sure, said he, these being of a pleasant scent and favour, cannot be offensive to nature.</Q> So having manured his ground, he takes a sample of ev∣ery root which he judged eatable, and boils them, as the surest way to experience their goodness.</P>
<P>Most of them proved not only passable good, but extraordinary; some eating like parsnips, others almost like carrots, but rather more a∣greeable; some like beets and turnips; every one in their several kinds, as good as ever he eat in England, but of different colours and make; some being bluish, others black, some red, and others yellow. These though not wanted, having sufficient to gratify a nicer taste than his, were, nevertheless, extremely wel∣come, being somewhat like his native country fare and product. So having returned thanks for this most agreeable addition to his ordinary, he sets a mark to every herb which those roots bore, in order to get some of the seed to sow in the ground he would prepare: so, being pro∣vided with flesh, fish, herbs, and several sorts of roots, he goes and examines what improve∣ment his peas and beans have made, which he found increased to admiration; the seven peas having produced one thousand, and the three beans one hundred: having returned thanks for that vast increase, he lays them by, in order to set them at a proper season, as he had done the year before.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="030190_0152_0FE50637106C73D8"/>
By this time his antelopes had kidded, one of them having brought three young ones, and the second two. This vast addition to his pro∣visions very much rejoiced him, being sure now not to want flesh at his need, which before he was in danger of, finding but seldom any thing in his net: so makes account to live upon two of the young bucks whilst they lasted, killing one as soon as fit for meat, and so now and then another, saving only five to breed; one whereof should be a mate to keep the females from the wood; lest at one time or other they should stay away for good and all.</P>
<P>The old ones being well fed, as he always took care to do, providing for them store of those greens he knew they loved; as also boil∣ed roots for them now and then, of which they are very fond; the young ones throve apace, and grew very fat: so that in three weeks time they were large and fit to eat. He killed one; which being roasted, proved to be more deli∣cious that any house-lamb, sucking pig, young fawn, or any other suckling whatever.</P>
<P>Having lived upon that, with now and then a little fish, about one month, which was as long as he could keep it eatable, having dressed it at two different times, five days interval; eating the cold remains in several manners; reserving one of the other two males for a time he should be scanted, and in want of flesh; but was unluckily disappointed by a parcel of large eagles, which flying one morning over the place where the young antelopes were play∣ing, being of a gay, as well as active disposi∣tion, launched themselves with precipitation
<PB N="148" REF="030190_0153_0FE50638A25A3080"/>
upon the male he reserved for time of need, and one of the females which he kept for breed; seeing his beloved diverters carrying away by those birds of prey, he runs in for his bow, but came too late with it, the eagles being gone.</P>
<P>Having lost his two dear antelopes, especial∣ly the female, having doomed the male for his own eating, he hardly could forbear weeping to think of their being cruelly torn to pieces by those ravenous creatures: thus having for some time lamented the loss, and bewailed their hard fate, he thinks on means to prevent the like evil for the time to come; and as his bow was not always at hand, he resolves upon making a net, and fastens it between the trees he saw them come in at.</P>
<P>The succeeding winter proving very wet and windy, gave him but little invitation to take his usual walks; so having every thing he had occasion for at hand, he kept close to his net-making; for which having twine to twist, and thread to ravel out to make the said twine, kept him employed till the following spring, which came on apace.</P>
<P>Having finished his net, and every thing which belonged to it, he goes and fastens it to the trees, as he had proposed; then takes a walk to his new plantations, which he found in a thriving condition; for which, and other bene∣fits already received, he resolves, as in duty bound, to attend at his usual place of worship, and sing thanksgiving psalms, which the hard∣ness of the weather had kept him from all the late winter; but it now coming into his mind, that whilst he was at his devotion, returning
<PB N="149" REF="030190_0154_0FE5063B938F6E58"/>
thanks for the fair prospect of a plentiful crop, his antelopes would break into the close, the hedge being as yet but thin, and devour the promising buds, which are the principal occa∣sion of his devotion; this not altogether im∣proper consideration puts a sad check to his re∣ligious intention: and though there was a vast obligation to prompt him to the performance of that part of his duty, yet he could not, with wisdom, run the hazard, out of mere devotion, to lose so promising a crop, which he should never be able to retrieve; all his stock of seed being then in grass.</P>
<P>As he was debating in his mind between re∣ligion and reason, whether the latter ought not to be a director to the former, he perceived his antelopes making towards the peas, to which they, doubtless, would have got in, had he not returned, and driven them another way: which accident convinced him he might find a more proper time to go about his devotion; no man being required to worship to his prejudice: so, having put off his religious duty till he had better secured his peas and beans, he cuts a parcel of branches, wherewith he stops those gaps to prevent the creatures going in; and having completed his work, he goes to his de∣votion, adding to his usual thanksgiving a par∣ticular collect for his luckily being in the way to prevent his being frustrated of the blessing Heaven so fairly promised to bestow on his labours.</P>
<P>Having paid his devotion, he walks about the island, being all the way delighted with the birds celebrating their Maker's praise, in their
<PB N="150" REF="030190_0155_0FE50640C3977EA0"/>
different harmonious notes! <Q>Every thing in nature, said he, answers the end of its creation, but ungrateful man! who, ambi∣tious to be wise as his Creator, only learns to make himself wretched.</Q> Thus he walks till evening, making several reflexions on the different conditions of men, preferring his pre∣sent state to that of Adam before his fall, who could not be sensible of happiness, having ne∣ver known a reverse; which, otherwise, he would have been more careful to prevent. Be∣ing come home, and near bed-time, he first ate his supper, and then, having performed his customary religious service, he goes to bed. The next morning, after paying his usual de∣votion, he takes a walk to his plantations, on which he implores a continuation of the pros∣perous condition they appear to be in; next, he goes to examine his nets, in which he finds a brace of fowls like ducks, but twice as large, and exceeding beautiful: the drake (which he knew by a coloured feather on his rump) was of a fine cinnamon colour upon his back, his breast of a mazarine blue, the belly of a deep orange, his neck green, head purple, his eyes, bill, and feet, red; every colour changing most agreeably as they moved. The duck was also very beautiful, but of quite different colours, and much paler than the drake's.</P>
<P>The disappointment in catching those de∣lightful fowls, instead of ravenous eagles, as he had purposed, no ways displeased him, but he rather was rejoiced to have such beautiful fowls to look at; yet it went much against his mind to deprive those creatures of their liberty (the
<PB N="151" REF="030190_0156_0FE506456499CFE0"/>
greatest comfort in life) which nature took such pains to adorn: <Q>But, said he, they were created for the use of man: so, in keeping them for my pleasure, they will but answer the end of their creation. Their confine∣ment shall be no stricter than my own; they shall have the whole island to range in.</Q> He then pinions them, puts them in the pond, and makes baskets for them to shelter in, which he places in the branches of those trees that hung closest to the water, taking particular care to feed them daily with roots roasted and boiled, and the guts of the fish, and other creatures, he used for his own eating; which made them thrive mainly, and take to the place; so that they bred in their season.</P>
<P>The five antelopes had by this time kidded, and brought ten young ones: his peas and beans also were wonderfully improved, having that season enough to stock the ground the year following. Thus he returned kind Providence thanks for the vast increase, and concludes to live upon the young antelopes as long as they lasted, reserving only one for suck of the old ones, to keep them in milk, of which he had taken notice they had plenty, designing to draw it daily for his own use; so that in a little time, he had enough to skim for cream, which he used for sauce instead of butter, and made small cheeses of the rest. Now having a pret∣ty store of dairy ware, he resolves to make a place to keep it in; the kitchen wherein he was obliged to lay his salt fish (which common∣ly smells strong,) not being a proper place for cream and milk: for which end he makes a
<PB N="152" REF="030190_0157_0FE50648833B2218"/>
dairy-house at the other side of his dwelling, with branches of trees, after the manner of a close arbour, and thatches it over with grass; which answering the kitchen in form and situa∣tion, made uniform wings, that added as much to the beauty as conveniency of the habitation.</P>
<P>Having completed his dairy, he proceeds in his resolution of making cheese, having learned the way in Holland; and for want of rennet to turn his milk, he takes some of the horse∣radish seed, which being of a hot nature, had the same effect: having curd to his mind, he seasons it to his palate; then with his hatchet, he cuts a notch round in the bark of a tree, a∣bout eighteen inches in circumference; and a second in the same manner, six inches below that; then slits the circle, and with his knife gently opens it, parting it from the tree: thus he makes as many hoops as he judged would contain his paste, which being girded round with cords to keep them from opening, he fills with the said paste, and lays them by, till fit to eat.</P>
<P>This being done, which completed his pro∣visions, he returns thanks for those blessings which had been so liberally bestowed on him: <Q>Now, said he, Heaven be praised! I ex∣ceed a prince in happiness: I have a habita∣tion strong and lasting, a beautiful and con∣venient freehold, store of comforts, with all necessaries of life free cost, which I enjoy with peace and pleasure uncontrouled: yet I think there is still something wanting to complete my happiness: if a partner in grief lessen sorrow, certainly it must in delight,
<PB N="153" REF="030190_0158_0FE5064A0B2086A8"/>
augment pleasure. What objects of admi∣ration are here concealed, and like a miser's treasure, hid from the world! If man, who was created for bliss, could have been com∣pletely happy alone, he would not have had a companion given him:</Q> thus he walks a∣bout thoughtful till bed-time.</P>
<P>In that disposition he goes to bed, and soon fell asleep: the night also, being windy, added to his disposition; but his mind finds no re∣pose: it still run heavy upon the subject that took it up the day before, and forms ideas suit∣able to his inclination; and as solitude was the motive of its being disturbed, he indulges it with the thoughts of company, dreaming that the same of his station, and happy state of life, was spread about the world; that it prompted a vast number of people, from all parts, to come to it, which at last induced se∣veral princes to claim a right to it; which be∣ing decided by a bloody war, a governor was sent, who laid taxes, demanded duties, raised rents, and warns him to be gone, having fixed upon his habitation for himself to dwell in. Being sadly disturbed, he cries out in his sleep, <Q>This is a great punishment for my uneasiness: could I not be contented with being lord of this island, without provoking Heaven to bring me under the power of extorting go∣vernors?</Q></P>
<P>There happening a great noise, he starts out of his sleep, with the thoughts of hearing a pro∣clamation; and cries out, <Q>Alas! it is too late to proclaim an evil which is already come:</Q> but being thoroughly awake, and
<PB N="154" REF="030190_0159_0FE50654E592FCF0"/>
the noise still continuing, he found he had been dreaming, which very much rejoiced him, he therefore put on his cloaths, and hastens to the place he heard the noise come from.</P>
<P>Being within forty or fifty yards thereof, he saw a number of monkeys of two different kinds; one sort squealing and fighting against the other without intermixing. At his ap∣proach the battle ceased; and the combatants, retiring at some distance, left the spot of ground, on which they fought clear; whereon lay a considerable quantity of wild pomegra∣nates, which the wind had shook off the trees the night before, and which were the occasion of their strife.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>His coming having caused a truce, every one of those creatures keeping still and quiet during his stay, he resolves to use his endea∣vours to make a solid peace; and as that dif∣ference
<PB N="155" REF="030190_0160_0FE506566F651650"/>
had arisen from the fruit there present, to which he could see no reason but that each kind had an equal right, he divides it into two equal parcels, which he lays opposite to each other towards both the parties, retiring a little way, to see whether this expedient would de∣cide the quarrel: which answered his intent; those animals quietly coming to that share next to them and peaceably carrying it away, each to their quarters. This occasioned several re∣flexions on the frivolous, and often unjust quar∣rels that arise among princes, which create such bloody wars, as prove the destruction of vast numbers of their subjects. <Q>If monarchs said he, always acted with as much reason as these creatures, how much blood and money would they save!</Q> Thus he goes on to his usual place of worship, in order to return thanks, that he was free of that evil, the dream where∣of had so tortured his mind; though he confess∣ed he justly deserved the reality, for his uneasi∣ness in the happiest of circumstances.</P>
<P>Having paid his devotion, he takes a walk to see how his peas and beans came on, which he found in a very improving disposition, each stem bearing a vast number of well filled pods. <Q>Heaven be praised! said he, I shall eat of this year's crop, and have sufficient to stock my ground the ensuing one.</Q></P>
<P>Thus being plentifully supplied with neces∣saries, and in a pleasant island, every thing a∣bout him being come to perfection; his dwell∣ing, which seems intended by nature for some immortal guest, being, by time, yearly repair∣ed and improved, leaving no room for care;
<PB N="156" REF="030190_0161_0FE50657F6D88700"/>
yet the unwise man, as if an enemy to his ease, cannot be contented with the enjoyment of more than he could reasonably crave, but must disturb his mind with what concerns him not: <Q>What pity, said he, so delightful a habi∣tation, attended with such conveniences, and situated in so wholesome an air, and fruitful a land, should at my death lose all those wonderful properties, being become useless for want of somebody to enjoy them! What admiration will here be lost for want of be∣holders? But what kind man could I set∣tle it upon, worthy of so fine an inheritance? Were it my pleasure to choose myself an heir, such only appear virtuous, whose weak na∣ture confides to chastity: every constitution cannot bear excess: want of courage occa∣sions mildness, and lack of strength good temper: thus virtue is made a cloak to in∣firmity. But why do I thus willingly ham∣per myself with those cares Providence has been pleased to free me of?</Q></P>
<P>Thus he holds the island from Providence: freely he bequeaths it to whom Providence shall think fit to bestow it upon: and that his heir may the better know the worth of the gift, he draws a map of the whole estate; and made an inventory of every individual tenement, ap∣purtenances, messuages, goods, and chattels, and also a draft of the terms and conditions he is to hold the here-mentioned possession upon; <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P><HI>Imprimis,</HI> A fair and most pleasant island, richly stocked with fine trees, and adorned with several delightful groves, planted and improv∣ed
<PB N="157" REF="030190_0162_0FE506598368B228"/>
by nature, stored with choice and delicious roots and plants for food, bearing peas and beans; likewise a noble fish-pond, well stocked with divers sorts of curious fish; and a spaci∣ous wood, harbouring several sorts of wild fowl, and beasts, sit for a nabob's table.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> A dwelling commenced by art, im∣proved by nature, and completed by time, which yearly keeps it in repair; and also its furniture.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> The officer and appurtenances thereof, with the utensils thereunto belonging; which said island, dwelling, &amp;c. are freehold, and clear from taxes; in no temporal dominion, there∣fore screened from any impositions, duties, and exactions; defended by nature from invasions or assaults; guarded and supported by Provi∣dence: all which incomparable possessions are to be held upon the following terms, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P>That whosoever shall be by Providence set∣tled in this blessed abode, shall, morning and evening, constantly (unless prevented by ill weather or accident) attend at the east side of this island, and within the alcove nature prepar∣ed for the lodgment of several harmonious echoes, and there pay his devotion; singing thanksgiving psalms to the great Origin and Director of all things, whose praises he will have the comfort to hear repeated by melodi∣ous voices.</P>
<P>Next, he shall religiously observe and keep a seventh day for worship only, from the rising of the sun until the going down thereof: there∣fore he shall, the day before, make all neces∣sary provision for that day.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="030190_0163_0FE50661988CE1B0"/>
That he shall, after any tempestuous wind or storm, visit the sea at the outside of the rock, at the east, south, west, and north ends, in order to assist any one in distress.</P>
<P>He shall not be wasteful of any thing what∣soever, especially of any creature's life; killing no more than what is necessary for his health: but shall every day examine his nets, setting at liberty the overplus of his necessity, lest they should perish in their confinement.</P>
<P>He must also keep every thing in the same order and cleanness he shall find them in; till and manure the ground yearly; set and sow plants and seeds, fit for food, in their proper seasons.</P>
<P>Having written this at the bottom of the map he had drawn, being supper time, he takes his meal; then goes to his usual evening de∣votion; and, after an hour's walk, to his bed, sleeping quietly all night, as being easy in his mind.</P>
<P>The next morning he takes his usual walks, and visits his nets. In that he had set for eagles, he found a fowl as big as a turkey, but the colour of a pheasant, only a tail like a par∣tridge; this having no sign of being a bird of prey, he was loth to kill it; but having had no fresh meat for above a week, he yields to his appetite, and dresses it, eating part thereof for his dinner: it was very fat and plump, and eat much like a pheasant, but rather tenderer, and fuller of gravy.</P>
<P>Though he was very well pleased with the bird he had taken, yet he had rather it had been one of the eagles which kept his young ante∣lopes
<PB N="159" REF="030190_0164_0FE5066B2A618878"/>
in jeopardy: but as he could not destroy them with his net, which he had hung a con∣siderable time without the intended success, he projects the prevention of their increase, by de∣stroying their eggs, leaving his nets wholly for the use they had been successful in; and searches the clifts of the rock next the sea, where those birds commonly build; where having found several nests, he takes away the eggs that were in them, being then their breed∣ing time, and carries them home, in order to empty the shells, and hang them up and down in his habitation, amongst the green leaves which covered the cieling thereof; but having accidentally broke one, and the yolk and white thereof being like that of a turkey, he had the curiosity to boil one and taste it, which eat much after the manner of a swan's. The rest he saved to eat now and then for a change, reaping a double advantage by robbing those birds; lessening thereby the damage they might do him in time, and adding a dish to his pre∣sent fare.</P>
<P>In this prosperous way he lived fifteen years, finding no alteration in the weather or seasons, nor meeting in all the time with any transacti∣ons worthy of record: still performing his usual exercises, and taking his walks with all the content and satisfaction his happy condition could procure; entirely forsaking all thoughts and desires of ever quitting the blessed station he then had in his possession.</P>
<P>Thus having walked the island over and over (which though delightful, yet the frequent re∣petition of the wonders it produces, renders
<PB N="160" REF="030190_0165_0FE5066CF80F0F18"/>
them, as it were, common, and less admira∣ble), he proceeds to view the sea, whose fluid element being ever in motion, daily affords new objects of admiration.</P>
<P>The day being fair, and the weather as calm, he sat down upon the rock, taking pleasure in seeing the waves roll, and, as it were, chase one another; the next pursuing the first, on which it rides, when come at; and being itself overtaken by a succeeding, is also mounted on thus, wave upon wave, till a bulky body is composed, too heavy for the undermost to bear, and then sinks all together: this, said he, is a true emblem of ambition; men striving to out∣do one another are often undone.</P>
<P>As he was making reflexions on the empti∣ness of vanity and pride, returning Heaven thanks, that he was separated from the world, which abounds in nothing else; a ship appears at a great distance, a sight he had not seen since his shipwreck: <Q>Unlucky invention; said he, that thou shouldst ever come into men's thoughts! the ark, which gave the first notion of a floating habitation, was or∣dered for the preservation of man; but its fatal copies daily expose him to destruction.</Q> Having therefore returned Heaven thanks for his being out of those dangers, he makes a so∣lemn vow, never to return into them again, though it were to gain the world: but his re∣solution proved as brittle as his nature was frail. The men on board had spied him out with their perspective glasses; and supposing him to be shipwrecked, and to want relief, sent their long-boat with two men to fetch him away.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="030190_0166_0FE5066E8630CEF0"/>
At their approach his heart alters its motion; his blood stops from its common course; his sinews are all relaxed, which intirely unframes his reason, and makes him a stranger to his own inclination; which struggling with his waver∣ing resolution, occasions a debate between hope and fear; but the boat being come pretty nigh, gave hope the advantage, and his late resolu∣tion yields to his revived inclination, which be∣ing now encouraged by a probable opportunity of being answered, rushes on to execution. He now, quitting all his former reliance on Pro∣vidence, depends altogether upon his getting away, blessing the lucky opportunity of seeing his blessed country again, for which pleasure he freely quits and forsakes all the happiness he enjoyed; gladly abandoning his delightful ha∣bitation, and plentiful island. He thinks no more of Providence; his mind is intirely ta∣ken up with his voyage; but disappointment, which often attends the greatest probabilities, snatches success out of his hand before he could grasp it, and intercepts his supposed infallible retreat; the boat could not approach him, by reason of the rocks running a great way into the sea under water; nor could he come at the boat for sharp points, and deep holes, which made it unfordable, as well as unnavigable; so that after several hours striving in vain on both sides to come at one another; the men, after they had striven all they could but to no purpose, said something to him in a rage, which he understood not, and went without him, more wretched now, than when he was first cast away. His full dependance on a retreat made
<PB N="162" REF="030190_0167_0FE5068021183E88"/>
him abandon all further reliance on Providence, whom then he could implore; but now, hav∣ing ungratefully despised Heaven's bounties, which had been so largely bestowed on him, he has forfeited all hopes of assistance from thence, and expects none from the world. Thus destitute, and in the greatest perplexity, he cries out, <Q>whither shall I now fly for help? The world can give me none, and I dare not crave any more from Heaven. O cursed delusion! but rather cursed weakness! why did I give way to it? had I not enough of the world, or was I grown weary of being happy?</Q> So, saying, he falls a weeping: <Q>Could I shed a flood of tears, sufficient to wash away my fault or ease me of the remorse it does create!</Q></P>
<P>The pains and labour he had been at in the day, climbing up and down the rock, drag∣ging himself to and fro, to come at the boat, having very much bruised his limbs; and the disappointment of his full dependance on the late promising success, as also the tormenting remorse, and heavy grief, for his sinful reliance thereon, much fatiguing his mind, rendered sleep, which is ordained for the refreshment of nature, of small relief to him; his thoughts are continually disturbed with frightful visions; all his past dangers glare at him, as if threat∣ening their return.</P>
<P>Being now awaked from his disagreeable sleep, he makes a firm resolution never to en∣deavour to go from hence, whatever oppor∣tunity offers, though attended with ever so great a probability of success, and prospect of gain; fully settling his whole mind and affec∣tion
<PB N="163" REF="030190_0168_0FE50681E30F4FB0"/>
on the state and condition Heaven has been pleased to place him in; resolving to let no∣thing enter into his thoughts, but his most grateful duty to so great a benefactor, who has so often and miraculously rescued him from death.</P>
<P>Thus having entirely banished the world out of his mind, which before often disturbed it, he limits his thoughts within the bounds of his blessed possession, which affords him more than is sufficient to make his life happy; where plenty flows on him, and pleasure attends his desires; abounding in all things that can gra∣tify his appetite, or delight his fancy: a herd of delightful antelopes, bounding and playing about his habitation, divert him at home; and in his walks he is entertained with the harmo∣ny of divers kinds of singing-birds; every place he comes at offers him new objects for pleasure: thus all seems to concur in complete∣ing his happiness.</P>
<P>In this most blessed state he thinks himself as Adam before his fall, having no room for wishes, only that every thing may continue in its present condition; but it cannot be expect∣ed, that fair weather, which smiles on the earth's beauty, will not change. The sun must go its course, and the seasons take their turn; which considerations must, for the present, admit some small care: he is naked, and his tender constitution susceptible of the cold; therefore the cloaths he was cast away in being worn out, he is obliged to think of providing something to defend his limbs from the hardness of the approaching winter, whilst it was yet warm.
<PB N="164" REF="030190_0169_0FE50683B3F45AA0"/>
Having considered what to make a wrapper of, he concludes upon using of the grass he made mats of, on which he lay, being soft and warm, very fit for that purpose: of this he cuts down a sufficient quantity, which, when ready to work, he makes small twine with, and plaits it in narrow braids, which he sews together with some of the same, and shapes a long loose gown, that covered him to his heels, with a cap of the same.</P>
<P>By that time he had finished his winter-garb, the weather was grown cold enough for him to put it on. The frosty season came on apace, in which there fell such a quantity of snow, that he was forced to make a broom, and sweep it away from about his habitation twice a day; as also the path he made to the places he had oc∣casion to go to, tossing the snow on each side, which before the winter was over, met at top, and covered it all the way; which obliged him to keep within doors for a considerable time, and melt snow instead of water; lest, when going for some, he might chance to be buried amongst the snow.</P>
<P>The winter being over, and the snow dissolv∣ed, the gay spring advances apace, offering nature its usual assistance, repairing the dam∣ages the last frost had done; which joyful tid∣ings made every thing smile. Quarll, also, finding himself revived, took his former walks, which the preceding bad weather had kept him from, though there had been no considerable storm the winter before.</P>
<P>He having a mind to view the sea, and being come to the outside of the north-west end of
<PB N="165" REF="030190_0170_0FE5068540454E30"/>
the rock, sees, at the foot thereof, something like part of the body of a large hollow tree, the ends whereof were stopped with its own pitch; and the middle, which was slit open from end to end, gaping by a stick laid across.</P>
<P>This put him in mind of canoes, with which Indians paddle up and down their lakes and ri∣vers; and being on that side the rock next to the island of California, he fancied some of them were come to visit this island, though not many in number; their canoes holding at most but two men; for the generality, one only: yet, as some of these people are accounted great thieves, daily robbing one another, he hastens home to secure what he had; but it was too late; they had been there already, and had ta∣ken away the cloaths he found in the chest; which being by far too little for him, hung carelessly on a pin behind his door. Had they been contented with that, he would not have regarded it; but they carried away some of his curious shells, and, what grieved him most, the fine bird he had taken such pains to dress and stuff, and care to preserve; as also his bow and arrows.</P>
<P>Having missed these things, which he much valued, he hastens to the outside of the rock, with his long staff in his hand, in hopes to over∣take them before they could get into their ca∣noe; but happened to go too late, they being already got half a league from the rock. Yet they did not carry away their theft: for there arising some wind, it made the sea somewhat rough, and overset their canoe; so that what was in it was all lost, but the two Indians, who
<PB N="166" REF="030190_0171_0FE50689A38EDFF0"/>
most dexterously turned it on its bottom again, and with surprising activity leaped in it, one at the one side, and the other at the opposite; so that the canoe being trimmed at once, they paddled out of sight.</P>
<P>Having seen as much of them as he could, he walks to the north-east side, in order to dis∣cover the effect of the high wind, which hap∣pened the night before.</P>
<P>Being come to the outside of the rock, he perceives something at a distance like a large chest, but having no lid on it; taking that to be the product of some late shipwreck, he grieved at the fatal accident; <Q>How long, reflected he, will covetousness decoy men to pursue wealth, at the cost of their precious lives? Has not nature provided every nation and country a sufficiency for its inhabitants? that they will rove on this most dangerous and boisterous sea, which may be titled Death's dominions, many perishing therein, and not one on it being safe.</Q></P>
<P>As he was bewailing their fate who he ima∣gined had been cast away, he sees two men come down the rock, with each a bundle in his arm, who went to that which he had taken to be a chest; and, having put their load in it, pushed it away till come to deep water; then, having got in it, with a long staff, shoved it off, till they could row to a long boat that lay at some distance behind a jetting part of the rock, which screened it from his sight, as also the ship it belonged to.</P>
<P>The sight of this much amazed him, and made him cease condoling others' supposed loss,
<PB N="167" REF="030190_0172_0FE5069B1049EFE8"/>
to run home and examine his own; well know∣ing those bundles, he saw carried away, must needs belong to him, there being no other moveables in the island but what were in his lodge.</P>
<P>Being come home, he finds indeed what he suspected; those villains had most sacrilegious∣ly rifled and ransacked his habitation, not leav∣ing him so much as one of the mats to keep his poor body from the ground; his winter garb also is gone, and what else they could find for their use.</P>
<P>The loss of those things, which he could not do without, filled him with sorrow. <Q>Now, said he, I am in my first state of being; nak∣ed I came into the world, and naked I shall go out of it;</Q> at which he fell a weeping.</P>
<P>Having grieved a while, <Q>Why, said he, should I thus cast myself down! Is not Pro∣vidence, who gave me them, able to give me more?</Q> Thus, having resolved before win∣ter to replenish his loss, he rests himself con∣tented, and gives the ruffians' evil action the best construction he could. <Q>Now I think on it, said he, these surely are the men, who, about twelve months since, would charitably have carried me hence, but could not for want of necessary implements; and now be∣ing better provided, came to accomplish their hospitable design; but not finding me, supposing I was either dead or gone, took a∣way what was here of no use; much good may what they have got do them, and may it be of as much use to them as it was to me.</Q> Thus he walks out, in order to cut grass to dry,
<PB N="168" REF="030190_0173_0FE5069C98C61E08"/>
and make himself new bedding, and a winter garb.</P>
<P>Having walked about half a mile, he per∣ceives the same men coming towards the pond. <Q>Heaven be praised! said he, here they be still. Now when they see I am not gone, nor willing to go, they will return my things, which they are sensible I cannot do without,</Q> with which words he goes up to them.</P>
<P>By this time they had caught the two old ducks, which, being pinioned, could not fly a∣way as the rest did. He was much vexed to see the best of his stock thus taken away, yet, as he thought they were come to do him ser∣vice, he could grudge them nothing, that would any wise gratify them for so good an in∣tent. But having returned them thanks for their good will, he told them he was very hap∣py in the island, and had made a vow never to go out of it.</P>
<P>These being Frenchmen, and of an employ∣ment where politeness is of little use, being fishermen, and not understanding what he said, only laughed in his face, and went on to the purpose they came about: then having as many of the ducks as they could get, they proceeded towards the house where they had seen the an∣telopes, some of which not running away at their approach, they proposed to catch hold of them.</P>
<P>Being come to the place where they used to feed, which was near the dwelling, the young ones, not being used to see any men in cloaths, nor any body but their master, presently sled; but the two old ones, which he had bred up,
<PB N="169" REF="030190_0174_0FE5069E22D10A48"/>
were so tame, that they stood still, only when the men came to them, they kept close to him, which gave the men opportunity to lay hold of them; when, notwithstanding Quarll's repeat∣ed intreaties, they tied a halter about their horns, and barbarously led them away.</P>
<P>Quarll was grieved to the heart to see his darlings, which he had taken such care to breed up, and which were become the principal part of his delight, following him up and down, and which, by their jumping and playing before him often dispersed melancholy thoughts; notwithstanding all these endearing qualifica∣tions, thus hauled away: he weeps, and on his knees begs they may be left; and though they understood not his words, his actions were so expressive and moving, that had they had the humanity of canibals, who eat one another, they would have yielded to so melting an object as the poor broken hearted Quarll was; but the inflexible boors went on, cruelly hauling and dragging the poor creatures, which, as if sen∣sible of the barbarity of the act, looked back to their afflicted master, as craving his assistance; which, at last, so exasperated him, that he was several times tempted to lay on the ravishers with his long staff; as often was stopt by the following consideration: <Q>Shall I, said he, be the destruction of my fellow creatures, to rescue out of their hands, animals of which I have an improving store left, and deprive them of their healths, and perhaps of their lives, to recover what cost me nought? Let them go with what they have, and the merit of their deed be their reward.</Q> Thus he
<PB N="170" REF="030190_0175_0FE506A2C008E940"/>
walks about melancholy, bemoaning his poor antelopes' fate, and his own misfortune: <Q>They were used to liberty, said he, which they now are deprived of, and for which they will pine and die, which, for their sake, I cannot but wish; for life without liberty is a con∣tinual death.</Q></P>
<P>As he was walking, thinking (as it is usual after the loss of anything one loves) of the plea∣sure he had during the enjoyment, the ruffians having secured the poor animals, came back with ropes in their hands. <Q>What do they want next? said he, have they not all they desire; would they carry away my ha∣bitation also? Sure they have no design on my person; if so, they will not take it so easily as they did my dear antelopes.</Q> Thus he resolved to exercise his quarter staff, if they offered to lay hands on him. The villains, whose design was to bind him, and so carry him away, seeing him armed and resolute, did not judge it safe for them to advance within the reach of his weapon, but keep at some distance, divining how to seize him.</P>
<P>Quarll, who, by their consulting, guessed at their design, not thinking proper to let them come to a resolution, makes at the nearest, who immediately takes to his heels, and then to the next, who immediately does the same. Thus he follows them about for a considerable time; but they divided, in order to the him with run∣ning, till the night approaching, and the wind rising, made them fear their retreat might be dangerous, if they deferred it; so that they went clear away: which being all he desired,
<PB N="171" REF="030190_0176_0FE506AA8A923128"/>
he returned as soon as he saw them in the long∣boat, which they rowed to their ship, that lay at anchor some distance from the rocks.</P>
<P>These wretches being gone, he returns Hea∣ven thanks for his deliverance; and as his bridge had favoured their coming, he pulls it off, and only laid it over when he had a mind to view the sea, and goes home to eat a bit, hav∣ing not as yet broken his fast. Having, there∣fore, eaten some of his roots and cheese, and being wearied with hunting these boors, he con∣sults how to lie, his bed and bedding being gone, as also his winter gown, and the nights being as yet cold: however, after a small con∣sideration, he concludes to lie in the lodge, which was left vacant by the stolen antelopes absence; whose litter being made of the same grass as his mats were, he lay both soft and warm.</P>
<P>Next morning having paid his usual devo∣tion, he goes into the kitchen, in order to breakfast, and afterwards to take his customary walk. Whilst he was eating, there arose a noise in the air, as proceeding from a quantity of rooks, jackdaws, crows, and such like birds, whose common notes he was acquainted with; and as the noise approached, he had the curio∣sity to go and see what was the matter, but was prevented by the coming of a large fowl, which flew over his head, as he was going out; he turned back to gaze at the bird, whose beauty seized him with admiration; the pleasure of seeing so charming a creature quite put out of his mind the curiosity of looking from whence proceeded the disagreeable noise with∣out;
<PB N="172" REF="030190_0177_0FE506AC150CB3D0"/>
which ceasing as soon as the bird was sheltered, made him imagine those carrion birds had been chasing that beautiful fowl, which, seeing itself out of danger, stood still, very calm and composed; which gave him the opportu∣nity of making a discussion of every individual beauty which composed; so delightful an object; it was about the bigness and form of a swan, almost headed like it, only the bill was not so long nor so broad, and red like coral; his eyes like those of a hawk, his head of a mazarine blue, and on the top of it a tuft of shining gold coloured feathers, which spread over it, hang∣ing near three inches beyond, all round; its breast, face, and part of its neck, milk white, curiously speckled with small black spots, a gold coloured circle about it; its back and neck behind of a fine crimson, speckled with purple; its legs and feet the same colour as its bill; its tail long and round, spreading like that of a peacock, composed of six rows of fea∣thers, all of different colours, which made a most delightful mixture.</P>
<P>Having spent several minutes in admiring the bird, he lays peas, and crumbled roots, both roasted and boiled, before it; as also water in a shell, withdrawing, to give it liberty to eat and drink; and stood peeping to see what it would do: which, being alone, having looked about, picks a few peas, and drinks heartily; then walks towards the door in a composed easy manner, much like that of a cock.</P>
<P>Quarll being at the outside, was dubious whether he should detain him, or let him go;
<PB N="173" REF="030190_0178_0FE506AD9F0B0198"/>
his affection for that admirable creature equally prompts him to both: he cannot bear the thoughts of parting with so lovely an object, nor harbour that of depriving it of liberty, which it so implicitly intrusted him withal. Thus after a a small pause, generosity prevails over self-pleasure; "Why should I," said he, "make the place of its refuge its prison?" He therefore makes room for it to go, which, with a slow pace, walks out; and having look∣ed about a small time, mounts up a consider∣able height; and then takes its course north∣west.</P>
<P>There happening nothing the remainder of the year worthy of record, he employs it in his customary occupations; as pruning and watering his lodge and dairy, making his mats to lie on, as also his winter garb; every day milking his antelopes and goats; making now and then butter and cheese, attending his nets, and such like necessary employments.</P>
<P>The mean time, the French mariners, who, probably, got money by what they had taken from him the year before, returned, it being much about the same season; and being re∣solved to take him away, and all they could make any thing of, out of the island, were provided with hands and implements to accom∣plish their design; as ropes to bind what they could get alive, and guns to shoot what they could not come at, saws and hatchets to cut down logwood and brazil, pick-axes and shov∣els to dig up orris roots, and others of worth, which they imagined the island produced; like∣wise flat bottomed boats to tow in shallow wa∣ter,
<PB N="174" REF="030190_0179_0FE506B9F3356000"/>
where others could not come; and thus by degrees to load their ship with booty: but ever watchful Providence blasted their evil pro∣jects, and confounded their devices, at the very instant they thought themselves sure of success; implements in a flat-bottomed boat were towed to the very foot of the rock, by a young fellow, who being lighter than a man, was thought fittest to go with the tools, which pretty well loaded the boat.</P>
<P>Their materials being landed, to their great satisfaction, the men on board embarked in two more of the same sort of boats; but were no sooner in them, but a storm arose, which dashed their slender bottoms to pieces, and washed them into the sea, in which they perish∣ed, oversetting also the flat bottomed boat on shore, with the load, and the lad underneath it.</P>
<P>The storm being over, which lasted from about eight in the morning till almost twelve at noon, Quarll, according to his custom, went to see if he could perceive any damage done by the late tempest, and if any, distressed by it, stood in want of help.</P>
<P>Being at that side of the rock he used to vi∣sit, he could see nothing but a few fishes and shells the sea had left in the clifts: <Q>If this, said he, be all the damage that has been done, make me thankful; it will recruit me with fresh fish and utensils.</Q> Going to the N. W. part, where he sees a battered boat, floating with the keel upwards, "This," said he, "bodes some mischief;" but thought it not to be of any consequence. Having gone about
<PB N="175" REF="030190_0180_0FE506BCF8768B48"/>
fifty yards further, he espies a small barrel at the foot of the rock, with several planks and fragments of a ship, floating with the tide: <Q>Alas! said he, these are too evident proofs of a shipwreck, to hope otherwise.</Q> As he was looking about, he hears a voice cry out, much like that of a man, at some distance, be∣hind a part of the rock: being advanced a small matter beyond where he was, <Q>Heaven be praised! said he, there is somebody, whom I am luckily come to save, and he is most fortunately come to be my companion: I cannot but rejoice at the event, though I heartily grieve for the accident.</Q> Hastening to the place where he thought the cries came from, which, as he advanced, he could discern to be too shrill for a man's voice, <Q>Certainly, said he, this must be some woman by the noise.</Q></P>
<P>He then, with his staff, endeavoured to break that which he took to be the lid of the chest, but proved the bottom; and, as he was strik∣ing, the boy underneath, calling to him to turn it up, thrust his hand under the side, which he perceiving, though he understood him not, stood still. Finding his mistake, <Q>This, said he, is a flat bottomed boat, such as the Frenchmen used the year before, when they came and plundered me. Now, am I safe if I turn it up? doubtless they are come in great numbers.</Q> Pausing awhile, and the lad (whom he took to be a woman) still con∣tinuing his moan, he was moved to compas∣sion; and, having considered the boat could not hold any great number, he ventures. <Q>Let
<PB N="176" REF="030190_0181_0FE506BF5D3182C0"/>
what will come on it, or who will be under, for the poor woman's sake I will relieve them; there cannot be many men. However I will let but one out at a time; if he be mischie∣vous, I am able to deal with him.</Q> At this, he puts the end of his staff where he had seen the hand, and lifts it up about a foot from the ground. Out of the opening immediately creeps the boy, who, on his knees, falls a beg∣ging and weeping, expecting death every mo∣ment, as being the merited punishment for the evil purpose he came about.</P>
<P>Being affected with his supplications, though the sight of the preparations made for his in∣tended ruin had moved him to anger against his mercenary companions, he helps the young fel∣low up by the hand; and the night coming on apace, he takes one of the hatchets that lay by, and gave another to the boy, then falls a knock∣ing the boat to pieces, and directed him to do the same, which he accordingly did.</P>
<P>The boat being demolished, they carried the boards up higher on the rock, as also the rest of the things; lest, in the night, some storm should rise, which might wash them back into the sea; it being then too late to bring them away. Having done, they each of them took up what they could carry, and so went home. The young Frenchman, finding a kinder treat∣ment than either he deserved or expected, was extraordinary submissive and tractable; which made Quarll the more kind and mild; and in∣stead of condemning his evil attempt, he com∣miserated his misfortune, and in room of re∣sentment showed him kindness. Thus having
<PB N="177" REF="030190_0182_0FE506C1044202F8"/>
given him of what he had to eat, he puts him to bed in his lodge, wherein he lay, till he had got his mats made up; then went to bed him∣self.</P>
<P>The next morning he rose and walked about till he thought it time for the boy to rise; he then calls him up, and takes him to the place that he usually went to every morning and evening to sing psalms; where the youth being come, and hearing so many different voices, and seeing nobody, was scared out of his wits, and took to his heels, making towards the rock as fast as he could; but as he was not acquaint∣ed with the easiest and most practicable parts thereof, Quarll had made an end of his psalm, and overtook him before he could get to the sea-side, into which he certainly would have cast himself at the fright; but Quarll, who, by the boy's staring, guessed his disorder, not having the benefit of the language, endeavour∣ed to calm him by his pleasing countenance, and prevented his drowning himself; but could not keep off a violent fit the fright had occa∣sioned, which held him several minutes.</P>
<P>The fit being over, he and the boy took away at divers times the remains of the boat, and what was in it, which they could not carry home the day before: then taking up two guns, <Q>Now, said he, these unlucky instruments, which were intended for destruction, shall be employed for the preservation of that they were to destroy;</Q> and taking them to his lodge, sets them at each side of the door; then being dinner time, he strikes a light and sets the boy to make a fire, whilst he made some
<PB N="178" REF="030190_0183_0FE506CA5836EDC8"/>
of the fish fit to fry, which he picked up upon the rock the evening before; then takes the dripping he saved, when he roasted any flesh, to fry them with. The boy, who had lived some time in Holland, where they used much butter, seeing dripping employed in room thereof, thought to please his master in making some; and as he had seen milk and cream in the dairy arbour, wanting a churn only, there being a small rundlet lying empty, he takes out one of the ends of it, in which, the next day, he beat butter.</P>
<P>Quarll, seeing this youth industrious, be∣gins to fancy him, notwithstanding the aversion he had conceived for his nation, ever since the ill treatment he had received from his coun∣trymen; and, as speech is one of the most ne∣cessary faculties to breed and maintain fellow∣ship, he took pains to teach him English.</P>
<P>The lad being acute and ingenious was soon made to understand it, and in six months ca∣pable to speak it sufficiently, so as to give his master a relation of his late coming, and to what intent. <Q>The men, said he, who a∣bout one year since carried away from hence some antelopes, with extraordinaty ducks, and several rarities, which they said belonged to a monstrous English Hermit, whose hair and beard covered his whole body, having got a great deal of money by showing them, encouraged others to come; whereupon se∣veral joining together, hired a ship to fetch away the Hermit, and what else they could find; therefore brought with them tools, and guns to shoot what they could not take alive.</Q>
<Q><PB N="179" REF="030190_0184_0FE506CD44CDB0C8"/>
Barbarous wretches! replied he, to kill my dear antelopes and ducks! pray, what did they intend to do with me?</Q> <Q>Why, said the boy, to make a show of you.</Q> <Q>To make a show of me! Sordid wretches! is a Christian then such a rarity amongst them? well, and what were the saws and hatchets for?</Q> <Q>To cut down your house, which they intended to make a drinking booth of.</Q> <Q>Oh monstrous! what time and nature has been fifteen years a completing, they would have ruined in a moment: well, thanks to Provi∣dence, their evil design is averted. Pray, what is become of those sacrilegious per∣sons?</Q> <Q>They are all drowned, said the boy.</Q> <Q>Then, replies he, the heavens are satis∣fied, and I avenged: but how camest thou to escape? for thou wast with them.</Q> <Q>No, replied the youth, I was upon the rock when their boat was dashed against it, and was over∣set with the same sea, under the flat-bottom∣ed boat, where you found me.</Q> <Q>That was a happy overset for thee. Well, is there no gratitude due to Providence for thy escape?</Q> <Q>Due to Providence? said he, why, I thought you had saved me: I am sure you let me out.</Q> <Q>Yes, replied Quarll; but I was sent by Providence for that pupose.</Q> <Q>That was kindly done too, said the boy; Well, when I see him, I will thank him: Doth he live hereabout?</Q> <Q>Poor ignorant creature! replied Quarll; why Providence is every where. What! didst thou never hear of Providence? What religion art thou of?</Q> <Q>Religion! answered the youth: I
<PB N="180" REF="030190_0185_0FE506CED1C01140"/>
don't know what you mean: I am a fisher∣man by trade, which my father lived by.</Q> <Q>Well, said Quarll, did he teach thee no∣thing else? no prayers?</Q> <Q>Prayers! repli∣ed the lad; why fishermen have no time to pray; that is for them who have nothing else to do: poor folks must work and get money; that is the way of our town.</Q> <Q>Covetous wretches! Well, said he, I grudge them not what they possess, since it is all the hap∣piness they aspire at; but thou shalt learn to pray, which will be of far more advantage to thee than work, both here and hereafter:</Q> from which time he begins to teach him the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Commandments; as also the principles of the Christian religion; all which instructions the youth taking readily, won his affection the more: he likewise taught him to sing psalms, which farther qualified him to be his companion in spiritual exercises, as well as in temporal occupations.</P>
<P>Now, having company, he is obliged to en∣large his bed, the lodge being wanted for his antelope against breeding time: he adds, there∣fore, to his mats. His other provisions also wanting to be augmented, and he having both tools and boards, out of the flat boat which he had taken to pieces, he and the lad went about making large boxes to salt flesh and fish in; then, with the boards that were left, they made a table for his dwelling that he had before, and one for his kitchen; as also shelves in the room of those that were made of wicker: then hav∣ing recruited his shell utensils that were stolen the year before, he was completely furnished
<PB N="181" REF="030190_0186_0FE506D1DE5B0AB8"/>
with all manner of conveniences; and Provi∣dence supplying him daily with other necessa∣ries, there was no room left him for wishes, but for thanksgiving, which they daily most religiously paid.</P>
<P>In this most happy state they lived in peace and concord the space of ten years, unanimously doing what was to be done, as it lay in each of their ways, without relying on one another.</P>
<P>Quarll, who before, though alone and de∣prived of society (the principal comfort of life), thought himself blessed, now cannot express his happiness, there being none in the world to be compared to it, heartily praying he might find no alteration until death: but the young man, not having met with so many disappoint∣ments in the world as he, had not quite with∣drawn his affections from it; his mind some∣times will run upon his native country, where he has left his relations, and where he cannot help wishing to be himself: thus, an opportu∣nity offering itself one day, as he went to get oysters, to make some sauce for some fresh cod-fish which Quarll was dressing, he saw, at a distance, a ship; at which his heart fell a panting; his pulses double their motion; his blood grows warmer and warmer, till at last, inflamed with desire of getting at it, he lays down the bag he brought to put the oysters in, as also the instrument to dredge them up with, and takes to swimming. The men on board, having espied him out, sent their boat to take him up; so he went away without taking leave of him he had received so much good from; who, having waited a considerable time, fear∣ing
<PB N="182" REF="030190_0187_0FE4FD12CF4D9E28"/>
some accident would befal him, leaves his cooking, and goes to see for him; and, being come at the place where he was to get the oys∣ters, he sees the bag and instruments lie, and nobody with them. Having called several times without being answered, various racking fears tortured his mind: sometimes he doubts he is fallen in some hole of the rock, there be∣ing many near that place where the oysters were: he therefore with his staff, which he al∣ways carried with him when he went abroad, at the other side of the rock grabbled in every one round the place; and, feeling nothing, he concludes some sea-monster had stolen him away, and, weeping, condemns himself as the cause of this fatal accident; resolving for the future, to punish himself by denying his appetite; and only eat to support nature, and not to please his palate.</P>
<P>Having given over hopes of getting him a∣gain, he returns home in the greatest affliction, resolving to fast till that time the next day; but, happening to look westward, in which point the wind stood, he perceives something like a boat at a great distance: wiping the tears off his eyes, and looking stedfastly, he discovers a sail beyond it, which quite altered the motive of his former fear: <Q>No monster, said he, hath devoured him: it is too plain a case, that he has villainously left me: but what could I expect of one who had project∣ed such evil against me?</Q> So saying he went home, and made an end of dressing his dinner; resting himself contented, being but as he was before, and rather better, since he
<PB N="183" REF="030190_0188_0FE506DE5E48D2A8"/>
had more conveniences, and tools to till his ground, and dig up his roots with. Having recommended himself to Providence, he re∣sumes his usual works and recreations, resolv∣ing that no cares shall mar his happiness for the future, being out of the way of all those irresistible temptations with which the world abounds, to lay the best men's hopes in the dust.</P>
<P>Being again alone, the whole business of the house lies upon his hands; he must now prune and trim the habitation that daily harbours him, being made of fine growing plants, which yearly shoot out young branches: this makes them grow out of shape. He must also till the ground; set and gather his peas and beans in their season; milk and feed his antelopes daily; make butter and cheese at proper times; dig up his roots; fetch in fuel and water when wanted; attend his nets; go to destroy eagles nests; and every day dress his own victuals: all which necessary occupations, besides the time dedicated for his usual devotions, kept him wholly employed; which made his renewed solitude less irksome. And, having walked all that afternoon to divert his thoughts, ad∣miring all the way the wonderful works of nature, both in the surprising rocks which sur∣rounded the island, and in the delightful crea∣tures, and admirable plants, that are in it; be∣ing weary with walking, he returns home, thanking kind Providence for settling him in so blessed a place, and in his way calls at his invisible choir; where, having sung a thanks∣giving psalm, and his usual evening hymn, he goes to supper, and then to bed, with a tho∣roughly
<PB N="184" REF="030190_0189_0FE506DFE8A68A38"/>
contented mind; which occasions plea∣sant dreams, to entertain his thoughts.</P>
<P>There happening a great noise of squealing, it waked him out of his dream; and his mind being impressed with notions of war, it at first seized him with terror: but being somewhat settled, and the noise still continuing, he per∣ceived it proceeded from the two different kinds of monkeys in the island, which were fighting for the wild pomegranates that the high wind had shaken off the trees the prece∣ding night which was very boisterous.</P>
<P>Having guessed the occasion of their debate, he rises, in order to go and quell their differ∣ence, by dividing amongst them the cause thereof. Getting up, he opens the door, at the outside of which, an old monkey of each sort were quietly waiting his levee, to entice him to come, as he once before did, and put an end to their bloody war.</P>
<P>He was not a little surprised to see two such inveterate enemies, who at other times never meet without fighting, at that juncture agree so well.</P>
<P>That most surprising sign of reason in those brutes, which, knowing his decision would compose their comrades difference, came to implore it, put him upon these reflexions: <Q>Would princes, said he, be but reason∣able, as those which by nature are irrational, how much blood and money would be sav∣ed;</Q> having admired the uneasiness of those poor creatures, who still went a few steps for∣ward, and then backward to him; he was in hopes to decoy one or both into his lodge, by
<PB N="185" REF="030190_0190_0FE506E172561008"/>
throwing meat to them: but those exemplary animals, hearing their fellows in trouble, had no regard to their separate interest, taking no notice of what he gave them; but kept walk∣ing to and again with all the tokens of unea∣siness they could express; which so moved him, that he hastened to the place; where his pre∣sence caused immediately a cessation of arms, and both parties retired a considerable distance from each other, waiting his sharing the wind∣falls; which being done, they quietly took that heap which lay next each kind, and went to their different quarters.</P>
<P>Fourteen years more being passed, every thing keeping its natural course, there hap∣pened nothing extraordinary, each succeeding year renewing the pleasures the preceding had produced. Thunders and high winds being frequent, though not equally violent, he thought it not material to record them, or their effects; as blowing and throwing fishes, shells, empty vessels, battered chests, &amp;c. upon the rock; only transactions and events wonderful and un∣common: and there happened a most surprising one a few days after, which though of no great moment, is as worthy of record as any of far greater concern; being a wonderful effect of Providence, manifested in a miraculous man∣ner, though not to be said supernatural.</P>
<P>One morning, when he had roasted a parcel of those roots which he used to eat instead of bread, and this he commonly did once a week, they eating best when stale; having spread them on his table and chest to cool, he went
<PB N="186" REF="030190_0191_0FE506F108A21540"/>
out to walk, leaving his door open to let the air in.</P>
<P>His walk, though graced with all the agree∣ables nature could adorn it with to make it de∣lightful; a grass carpet, embroidered with beautiful flowers, of many different colours and smells, under his feet, to tread on; before, and on each side of him, fine lofty trees, of various forms and heights, cloathed with plea∣sant green leaves, trimmed with rich blossoms of many colours, to divert his eye; a number of various sorts of melodious singing birds perching in their most lovely shades, as though nature had studied to excel man's brightest imagination, and exquisiteness of art: yet all these profusenesses of nature's wonders are not sufficient to keep away or expel anxious thoughts from his mind. It runs upon his two dear an∣telopes, the darling heads of his present stock, which he took such care to bring up, and were so engaging, always attending him in those fine walks; adding, by their swift races, active leapings, and other uncommon diversions, to the natural pleasantness of the place; which now, by their most lamented absence, is be∣come a dull memorandum of the barbarous manner in which they were ravished away from him.</P>
<P>In these melancholy thoughts, which his lonesomeness every now and then created, he returns home, where Providence had left a re∣medy for his grievance: a companion, far ex∣ceeding any he ever had, waits his return; which was a beautiful monkey of the finest kind, and the most complete of the sort, as
<PB N="187" REF="030190_0192_0FE506F2A3F644B0"/>
though made to manifest the unparalleled skill of nature, and sent him by Providence to dis∣sipate his melancholy.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Being come to his lodge, and beholding that wonderful creature, and in his own possession, at the farthest end of it, and him at the en∣trance thereof to oppose its flight, if offered, he is at once filled with joy and admiration: <Q>Long, said he, I endeavoured in vain to get one, and would have been glad of any, though of the worst kind, and even of the meanest of the sort; and here kind Provi∣dence has sent me one of an unparalleled beauty.</Q></P>
<P>Having a considerable time admired the beast, which all the while stood unconcerned, now and then eating of the roots that lay before him, he shuts the door, and goes in, with a resolution of staying within all day in order to
<PB N="188" REF="030190_0193_0FE506F46FA649B8"/>
tame him, which he hoped would be no diffi∣cult matter, his disposition being already pretty familiar, little thinking that Providence, who sent him thither, had already qualified him for the commission he bore; which having found out by the creature's surprising docility, he re∣turns his Benefactor his most hearty thanks for that miraculous gift.</P>
<P>This most wonderful animal, having by its surprising tractability and good nature, joined to its matchless handsomeness, gained its mas∣ter's love, beyond what is usual to place on any sort of beasts; he thought himself doubly re∣compensed for all his former losses, especially for that of his late ungrateful companion, who, notwithstanding all the obligations he held from him, basely left him, at a time he might be most helpful; and as he fancied his dear Beausiddle (for so he called that admirable creature) had some sort of resemblance to the picture he framed of him, he takes it down, thinking it unjust to bear in his sight that vile object, which could not in any wise claim a like∣ness to so worthy a creature as his beloved mon∣key.</P>
<P>One day that Quarll had occasion to go out, he happened to leave his pen and ink upon the table and some parchment he had been writing on close by it; Beausiddle perceiving his mas∣ter from home, immediately falls to work, scribbling over every word Quarll had been writing; and when done, he laid it by in the chest, as he saw his master do with what he had written; he then takes out another, which he does the same to, and so to half a dozen more,
<PB N="189" REF="030190_0194_0FE506F5FAD87BD0"/>
until his master's return prevented his doing any more mischief; however, in a quarter of an hour that he was absent, he blotted out as much as had taken full six months in writing.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Another day, as this lovely animal was of∣ficiating the charge it had of its own accord taken, being gone for wood, as wont to do when wanted, he finds in his way a wild pome∣granate, whose extraordinary size and weight had caused it to fall off the tree: he takes it home, and then returns for his faggot; in which time Quarll, wishing the goodness of the inside might answer its outward beauty, cuts it open; and, finding it of a dull lusci∣ousness, too flat for eating, imagined it might be used with things of an acid and sharp taste; having therefore boiled some water, he puts it into a vessel, with a sort of an herb which is of taste and nature of cresses, and some of the
<PB N="190" REF="030190_0195_0FE5070A11337910"/>
pomegranate, letting them infuse some time, now and then stirring it; which the monkey having taken notice of, did the same: but one very hot day, happening to lay the vessel in the sun, made it turn sour.</P>
<P>Quarll, who very much wanted vinegar in his sauces, was well pleased with the accident, and so continued the souring of the liquor, which proving excellent, he made a five gal∣lon vessel of it, having several which at times he found upon the rock.</P>
<P>Having now store of vinegar, and being a great lover of pickles, which he had learnt to make by seeing his wife, who was an extraor∣dinary cook, and made of all sorts every year; calling to mind he had often in his walks seen something like mushrooms, he makes it his business to look for some: thus he picked up a few, of which Beausidelle (who followed him up and down) having taken notice, immedi∣ately ranges about, and being nimbler footed than his master, and not obliged to stoop so low, picked double the quantity in the same space of time; so that he soon had enough to serve him till the next season.</P>
<P>His good success in making that sort of pic∣kle encourages him to try another; and, hav∣ing taken notice of a plant in the wood that bears a small green flower, which, before it is blown, looks like a caper, he gathers a few: and, their taste and flavour being no way dis∣agreeable, judging that, when pickled, they would be pleasant, he tries them, which, ac∣cording to his mind, were full as good as the real ones; and gathers a sufficient quantity,
<PB N="191" REF="030190_0196_0FE5070BEF685A40"/>
with the help of his attendant, stocking him∣self with two as pleasant pickles as different sorts. But there is another which he admires above all: none, to his mind like the cucum∣ber; and the island producing none, left him no room to hope for any; yet (as likeness is a vast help to imagination) if he could but find any thing, which ever so little resembles them in make, nature, or taste, it will please his fancy: he therefore examines every kind of buds, blossoms, and seeds; having at last sound that of a wild parsnip, which being long and narrow, almost the bigness and make of a pickling cucumber, green and crisp withal, full of a small flat seed, not unlike that of the thing he would have it to be, he pickles some of them; which being of a colour, and near upon the make, he fancies them quite of the taste.</P>
<P>His beans being at that time large enough for the first crop, he gathers some for his din∣ner: the shells being tender and of a delicate green, it came into his mind, they might be made to imitate French beans: <Q>they are, said he, near the nature, I can make them quite of the shape, so be they have the same savour.</Q> Accordingly he cuts them in long narrow slips, and pickles some; the other part he boils; and there being none to contradict their taste, they passed current for as good French beans as any that ever grew.</P>
<P>The disappointment of having something more comfortable than water to drink being retrieved by producing, in the room thereof, wherewithal to make his eatables more delici∣ous,
<PB N="192" REF="030190_0197_0FE5070D781675A0"/>
he proceeds in his first project; and, tak∣ing necessary care to prevent that accident which intercepted success in his first undertak∣ing, he accomplishes his design, and makes a liquor no wise inferior to the best cyder; so that now he has both to revive and keep up his spirits, as well as to please his palate, and suit his appetite.</P>
<P>Having now nothing to crave or wish for, but rather all motives for content; he lies down with a peaceable mind, no care or fear disturbing his thoughts: his sleep is not inter∣rupted with frightful fancies, but rather di∣verted with pleasant and diverting dreams; he is not startled at thunder or storms, though ever so terrible, his trust being on Providence, who at sundry times, and in various manners, has rescued him from death, though apparently unavoidable; being for above thirty years mi∣raculously protected and maintained in a place so remote from all human help and assistance.</P>

<HEAD>A SKETCH OF UNIVERSAL HISTORY.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE following Sketch of Universal History was written by a gentleman for the use of two young ladies, and not intended for publication; but as it was designed to sup∣ply what he thought was wanting to give the minds of children some idea of general history, and as it perfectly answered the purpose for which he composed it, he has been induced to publish it, that others might reap the same advantage which those have for whose use it was particularly composed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>There are, it is true, many abridgments of Sacred, Greek, Roman, and English Histories; but some short sketch of General History seems wanting; that the learner may be enabled to see how the separate parts are connected with each other. This deficiency is here attempted to be supplied; and as young minds are too volatile to be long fixed, it is drawn on as small a scale as possible: on the same account it was thought proper not to load it with chronological dates, but to throw it into a concise and sim∣ple narrative, that the connexion of the successive events
<PB N="194" REF="030190_0199_0FE4FDBD6F3232F8"/>
with each other might be readily acquired, and easily re∣tained when acquired.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The author has carefully avoided the giving a greater space to those circumstances which are nearest the present time: for though in larger histories this must necessarily happen from the increasing quantity of materials, yet it is a fault in a work of this sort, since it tends to impress on the duc∣tile imagination of youth wrong ideas of chronology which are not easily eradicated, as the mind will be apt to con∣nect the length of the aera with the number of the pages it occupies.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The author of these pages is free to confess that his own imagination, even in riper years, was so much biassed by this early prejudice, that it cost him some pains to cor∣rect it; and he will venture to say, that many persons of no inconsiderable historical knowledge will find the time bestowed on a careful perusal of this Sketch, accompanied with an inspection of Doctor Priestley's Historical and Biographical Charts, by no means thrown away.</HI></P>

<DIV2 TYPE="history">
<P>THE earliest information we have of the ac∣tions of mankind is from the Holy Scriptures. We have there an account of the creation of the world, the destruction of it by the Flood, the the renewal of mankind by the family of Noah, who were preserved in the Ark, and their increase and dispersion over the whole face of the earth. The Scriptures then proceed prin∣cipally with the history of the descendants of Abraham, whose great grandson Joseph set∣tling in Egypt with his eleven brothers, they became, with their progeny, slaves to that powerful people. But increasing in process of time, they migrated from thence and settled in
<PB N="195" REF="030190_0200_0FE4FE82D3AAFD08"/>
Palestine, after many wars, expelling the old inhabitants, who are called in our translation of the Bible, Philistines. The descendants of Abraham styled themselves Israelites, or chil∣dren of Israel, from Jacob, the father of Joseph, who was also named Israel. They divided the country among their twelve tribes, distinguish∣ed by the names of the twelve sons of Jacob, from whom they were severally descended. At first they were governed by magistrates called Judges; and afterwards by Kings. In the reign of Rehoboam, their fourth King, son to Solo∣mon, and grandson to David, ten of the tribes revolted, under a leader named Jeroboam, leaving two tribes only, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Juda and Ben∣jamin, under Rehoboam, whose descendants were called Kings of Juda, from whence the name of Jews was derived; and the successors of Jeroboam were called Kings of Israel.</P>
<P>Several powerful nations arose in their neigh∣bourhood, which all became in time subject to the empire of Assyria. To such a formidable enemy the offspring of Abraham were an easy conquest: the ten tribes of Israel were carried into captivity, and their name no more heard of among the nations: the chief person among the Jews were also carried to Babylon, the ca∣pital of Assyria; but the people were permitted to remain at home under the dominion of their conquerors.</P>
<P>Soon after this a new power arose. The King of Assyria turned his arms against the Medes and Persians. Cambyses, King of Persia, had married Mandane, daughter of Astyages, King of Media. The first attack of the Assyrians
<PB N="196" REF="030190_0201_0FE4FE87A6B218F0"/>
was against Media. The Persians sent Cyrus, son of Cambyses and Mandane, at the head of an army, to the assistance of his uncle Cy∣axares, who was then King. The invader was repelled, invaded in his turn, the King of Assyria killed at the taking of Babylon, and the whole empire reduced under the dominion of the Medes and Persians; over both of whom Cyrus reigned, by marrying the only daugh∣ter of his uncle Cyaxares. Thus was the Per∣sian empire founded.</P>
<P>The Persian empire extended over all the known parts of Asia: and the ambition of Darius, a successor though not a descendant of Cyrus, induced him to attempt the conquest of part of Europe; but here he met with a se∣vere repulse from the Grecian republics.</P>
<P>This small people, who inhabited a country of narrow extent, were not only able by their courage and military skill to check this power∣ful invader, but they had made such a profici∣ency in wisdom and arts, that we may now say, every attainment modern Europe has made in both is principally, if not solely, derived from them. The origin of this singular people is very uncertain. The first time they made any conspicuous figure in the annals of man∣kind, was in the Trojan war, which has been rendered immortal by the poems of Homer. At that time they were divided into small king∣doms, under limited monarchs; all of which, before the Persian invasion, were formed into republics.</P>
<P>The Persian King Darius despised such feeble antagonists; but both he and his son Xerxes
<PB N="197" REF="030190_0202_0FE4FE8935FC9650"/>
soon learned, by fatal experience, the advan∣tage of valour and discipline over timid mul∣titudes. After the loss of immense armies, the Kings of Persia contented themselves with fo∣menting the differences which began to arise among the Grecian republics, in which Athens and Sparta took the lead; and remaining anxi∣ous spectators of the bloody wars which they made with each other, when freed from the ap∣prehensions of a foreign enemy.</P>
<P>While Greece was thus wasting her strength in wars at home, great jealousy was still enter∣tained lest the common enemy (for so the King of Persia was esteemed) should take advantage of her weakness to accomplish his ambitious designs, when a storm unexpectedly burst on them from another quarter.</P>
<P>There was a country to the north of Greece, called Macedonia, which, though in many res∣pects congenial with it, was looked on as bar∣barous (for the Greeks called all nations but themselves barbarians). Macedonia was go∣verned by an absolute King. Philip, Prince of Macedonia, happening, on some occasion, to be an hostage among the Greeks, had the ad∣vantage, at the same time, of learning their art of war and seeing their internal dissentions. Profiting by this knowledge, when he succeeded to the throne of Macedonia, he so contrived to embroil the affairs of Greece by corruption and intrigue, and by taking part, sometimes with one party, and sometimes with another, so to weaken the whole, that, having bribed the chiefs of some of the republics to his interest, and totally defeated the Athenians and their
<PB N="198" REF="030190_0203_0FE508459CE199B8"/>
allies at the battle of Chaeronea, he rendered Greece entirely dependent on himself.</P>
<P>Knowing, however, the difficulty of keep∣ing such a people in peaceable subjection, he planned the popular scheme of an invasion of Persia; assembling for this purpose the whole force of Greece, and causing himself to be ac∣knowledged chief of the confederacy. In the midst of this undertaking he was assassinated, and was succeeded in his power by his son, distinguished by the appellation of Alexander the Great.</P>
<P>Alexander, immediately putting himself at the head of this formidable army, conquered the Persian empire with all its depedencies, and, penetrating to the banks of the Ganges, sub∣dued even part of that country so well known to us by the name of the East Indies. But this immense empire was of short duration; for, on his return, he died at Babylon, as some say, by poison, as others by excessive drinking, leaving his vast dominions to be divided among his generals. Asia, Egypt, and Greece, ex∣hibited a continual scene of war and desolation; especially Greece, where there were perpetual struggles between the successors of Alexander for dominion, and the republics for liberty, till the whole was reduced to subjection by the power of Rome.</P>
<P>Rome, which makes so conspicuous a figure in the history of mankind, arose from being a small state to the utmost extent of territory and power. At first it was governed by Kings, who were expelled for their tyranny, and two annual magistrates chosen in their place; these,
<PB N="199" REF="030190_0204_0FE4FD6966F2BFB8"/>
with the senate and assemblies of the people, formed the government, not unlike our Presi∣dent, Senate, and House of Representatives. The Romans soon engaged in wars with the other states of Italy, all of which they finally conquer∣ed; increasing by those means not only their strength but their military knowledge; and as many of the Italian states were Greek colonies, they had all the advantage of the Grecian art of war improved by their own experience. Being masters of Italy, they turned their arms a∣gainst Sicily, which engaged them in a war with Carthage, a powerful state on the north of Afri∣ca, who had colonies in that island. This war was prosecuted with various success, till the perseverance and courage of the Romans pre∣vailed, and Carthage was totally subdued.</P>
<P>To return to the affairs of Greece: Rome made the assisting the Greek republics a pre∣tence for interfering in their disputes, and fi∣nally reduced both the oppressors and the op∣pressed to an entire dependence on herself.</P>
<P>The armies of Rome now became invincible. Not only Asia, Egypt, Greece, and the north∣ern parts of Africa, were subdued, but she extended her conquests to Spain, Gaul, and Britain.</P>
<P>Yet, amid these splendid scenes of victory abroad, Rome was torn to pieces by factions at home. At first the struggles were between the senate and the people, till particular per∣sons obtaining power by holding long com∣mands abroad, the names of the popular, or noble party were only used as skreens to the ambition of individuals. The last great con∣test
<PB N="200" REF="030190_0205_0FE4FD6AEECC87A0"/>
was between Julius Caesar and Pompey; the first of whom had commanded in the nor∣thern, and the other in the eastern provinces. The decisive battle of Pharsalia, and the sub∣sequent death of Pompey, gave the whole Ro∣man empire into the hands of Caesar. The spirit of liberty, however, made one dying ef∣fort. Caesar was stabbed in the senate house, and an army raised in defence of public free∣dom. But after a short war, the veteran troops of Caesar, under command of Octa∣vius, his nephew and adopted heir, Marcus Antonius, his friend, and Lepidus, one of his generals, defeated the army of the republic, and the three leaders divided the empire a∣mong them.</P>
<P>Lepidus, being a weak man, was soon de∣posed; and M. Antonius, devoted to his plea∣sures, shut himself up in Egypt with Cleopa∣tra, the queen of that country. Octavius Cae∣sar, taking advantage of his indolence, en∣croached on his provinces, and a war ensuing, Antonius was totally defeated at the naval bat∣tle of Actium, soon after which he killed him∣self, and Octavius remained sole master of the Roman empire, with the title of Emperor, and the name of Augustus Caesar; and Rome, with its vast territories, from this period be∣came subject to the dominion of an arbitrary monarch.</P>
<P>Our Saviour was born during the reign of Augustus, and suffered crucifixion under Tibe∣rius, his immediate successor.</P>
<P>From this time the whole civilized world being under one master, history for a long pe∣riod
<PB N="201" REF="030190_0206_0FE5076B476497E8"/>
has little else to record than the characters of the Roman Emperors; and mankind were happy or miserable as their governors were mild or cruel. Perhaps the state of the human race was never more enviable than when such charac∣ters as Titus, Trajan, or the Antonines, were masters of the world. While under the govern∣ment of such monsters, as Caligula, Nero, and Domitian, who seemed to delight only in cru∣elty, mankind were in the most miserable situ∣ation, unable either to resist the power of the tyrant, or escape from his dominions, as there was no country out of the limits of the Roman empire that was not inhabited by the most sa∣vage barbarians. It may not be amiss here to mention, that, under the reign of Titus, tenth Emperor from Augustus, the city of Jerusalem, after repeated rebellions, was finally destroyed by the Romans, and the Jews dispersed, as they remain at this day: a singular instance of a peo∣ple, who, having lost their country, still main∣tain, though scattered over the face of the earth, their religion, their language, and their laws, the same as they were at a period far be∣yond any antiquity to which the annals of any the most ancient nation extend.</P>
<P>Though the barbarous tribes that bordered on the Roman empire were continually infest∣ing the frontiers with hostilities, and gradually encroaching on its provinces, yet it suffered no great diminution of territory till after the time of Constantine, who was the forty-first Empe∣ror in succession from Augustus, and lived up∣wards of three hundred years after him</P>
<P>During that period Christianity had been
<PB N="202" REF="030190_0207_0FE4FD6DEB059C60"/>
gradually, though privately, extending itself. The professors of it had been cruelly persecuted by some of the Emperors, and tolerated by others; but Constantine was the first Emperor who openly professed to be a Christian, and from his time Christianity became the estab∣lished religion of the empire.</P>
<P>Constantine, from an absurd vanity, remov∣ed the imperial seat from Rome to a city of his own building, between the Mediterranean and Euxine Seas, which he called Constanti∣nopolis, or the city of Constantine; and on his death he divided the empire between his sons. From this time the Roman empire con∣sisted of two parts; the one, whose seat conti∣nued at Rome, was called the Western Empire; the other, whose capital was Constantinople, was called the Eastern, and sometimes the Gre∣cian Empire</P>
<P>The empire, being thus divided, grew con∣sequently weaker, and the inroads of the bar∣barous nations more formidable. The Goths and Vandals attacked the Western empire. The Franks, a brave, though uncivilized peo∣ple, possessed themselves of Gaul, from whom it received the name of France. The Britons, on being abandoned by Rome to the inroads of the savage tribes in the north of the island, call∣ed in the Saxons to their assistance, who soon made themselves masters of the whole, except the mountains of Wales and Scotland, which afforded an asylum to the ancient inhabitants. And Rome itself, under Augustulus, the last of its Emperors, was taken by Odoacer, King of the Heruli.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="030190_0208_0FE4FDB03577A710"/>
The Eastern empire was attacked by the Sa∣racens, a fierce people, who had embraced the religion of Mahomet, an impostor and founder of a new sect, whose doctrine soon spread, and still retains its influence in the East. This warlike race conquered Arabia, Syria, Egypt, and the northern coasts of Africa; but they were, in their turn, expelled by the Turks, a nation of Scythian origin, who adopted the re∣ligion and manners of the vanquished. The provinces of the Eastern empire gradually mouldered away, till it was at last confined to the walls of Constantinople. A final period was put to the Roman empire so late as the year of our lord 1453, when Constantinople was taken by Mahomet, Sultan of the Turks, of whose dominion it has ever since remained the capital. This happened under Constantine X. (the hundred and fourteenth Emperor in suc∣cession from Augustus), who was killed in the assault, 2200 years from the foundation of Rome, and during the reign of Henry VI. of England.</P>
<P>This was the real end of the Roman empire; but previous to this, so early as the year of our Lord 800, there was a pretended revival of it in the person of Charlemagne, or Charles the Great.</P>
<P>The barbarous tribes who overturned the Roman empire, having very obscure notions of any religion, easily adopted that of the people they conquered; and as the Saracens, and after them the Turks, who ravaged the East, embra∣ced the errours of Mahomet, which they found established in Arabia, so the northern barba∣rians
<PB N="204" REF="030190_0209_0FE4FDB215AC1498"/>
who conquered Gaul, Germany, and Italy, were easily converted to the faith of Christ: and the Bishop of Rome, who assu∣med the title of Pope, and Patriarch of the Roman church, soon obtained the same influ∣ence over the Heruli, and the Lombards, who succeeded them, as he had over the Romans under their Christian Emperors. But Deside∣rius, the Lombard King of Italy, opposing the ambition of Pope Stephen III. the Pope called Charlemagne, King of France, to his aid, who dethroned Desiderius and conquered Italy: as a reward for which, the Pope crowned him Emperor at Rome; and Charlemagne becom∣ing afterwards master of Germany, and divid∣ing his dominions between his sons, that to whom Germany fell retained the title of Roman Em∣peror, which his successors still continue to assume: and the head of a limited elective mo∣narchy, who resides at Vienna, now calls him∣self Emperor of the Romans, and takes the names of Caesar and Augustus.</P>
<P>About the same time that Charlemagne made these conquests on the continent of Europe, Egbert united the seven provinces into which the Saxons had divided all the southern part of Britain (except Wales) into one kingdom by the name of England.</P>
<P>These barbarians were no sooner settled in their conquests, and in some degree civilized, than a fresh inundation poured in from the north, under the name of Danes and Normans, and, committing the same ravages on the new possessors which they had committed on the old inhabitants, at last fixed themselves, part in
<PB N="205" REF="030190_0210_0FE5076CF05B6118"/>
Germany, part in England, and part in that province of France which yet retains the name of Normandy; and, as their predecessors had done, soon assumed the religion and manners of the vanquished.</P>
<P>As these northern nations settled over all the western parts of Europe, which were divided by them into many states, so the same form of government, derived from the same origin, was established in them all. The leader of each army of invaders was considered as King, and in some measure as proprietor of the conquered territory. But as it was necessary to have an army ready at all times to repel new invaders, and guard against the encroachment of neigh∣bours, the King, or General, parceled out his land among the superior officers, who, by way of acknowledgment, were bound to furnish him with a proportionable assistance of men and arms in time of war, and to attend his councils in time of peace. And these leaders, to enable themselves to command the requisite number of troops which they were to furnish, allotted part of their lands again to the infe∣rior officers and soldiers, on condition that they should attend them to the wars when summoned by the King or the Lord Paramount. And this, which is called the feudal system, is the origin of that limited monarchy, which, till within these two centuries, was established through∣out the greatest part of Europe, and which Great Britain has preserved to this time.</P>
<P>Civilization had as yet made but a small progress: the writings of the ancient Greeks and Romans, which are now the models of
<PB N="206" REF="030190_0211_0FE5077146754648"/>
every thing great and elegant, were confined to the hands of a bigoted clergy; and war was the sole delight of princes and nobles too igno∣rant even to write their names.</P>
<P>This warlike spirit, however, was attended by some good consequences: for the Saracens, who had over-run the eastern parts of Europe, began to turn their arms against the southern parts of western Europe: they threatened Italy, invaded the south part of France, their African colonies had made themselves masters of the best part of Spain, and nothing less than the warlike turn of its inhabitants could have pre∣vented all Europe from becoming a prey to these fierce barbarians, and the consequent rudeness and despotism which ever have attend∣ed the religion of Mahomet wherever it pre∣vails.</P>
<P>The Christian Doctrine, corrupted as it was by the Church of Rome, had yet a tendency to polish and soften the manners of its professors; and even the power of the Pope, whose supre∣macy was acknowledged by so many independ∣ent and turbulent princes, though often used for the purposes of superstition, was sometimes also instrumental in stopping the progress, or mitigating the horrors of war.</P>
<P>A new spirit of enterprize now took place in Europe. As the zeal for Christianity increas∣ed, the warlike princes and nobles who pro∣fessed it beheld with indignation the scene of all the miracles, recorded both in the Old and New Testament, in the hands of infidels. The Pope encouraged this religious fervour; and vast armies were poured forth to rescue these
<PB N="207" REF="030190_0212_0FE5077D1709CBF0"/>
consecrated seats from the Mahometans. But, after deluging the plains of Palestine with Chri∣stian blood, and making a conquest of Jerusa∣lem, which could not be retained, the votaries of Mahomet remained, and still remain, pos∣sessors of that country which is commonly called the Holy Land.</P>
<P>Some advantage, however, was derived from these enterprizes. Part of the immense armies that passed from Europe to Asia, took their rout by Constantinople; and though, to their shame it must be owned, that while their end was to rescue part of Asia from the power of in∣fidels, they themselves committed devastation in the dominions of the only Christian Prince in the east of Europe, yet they were struck with the magnificence of the court of Constantino∣ple, where some relics of the splendour of the Roman empire were still preserved. This in∣troduced a taste for the arts among the Princes of western Europe; and on the Turks putting an end to the Eastern empire by the capture of Constantinople, the learned men of that city migrated into France, Italy, Germany, and Britain, and introduced there a knowledge of Grecian literature.</P>
<P>Happily for the revival of learning, Leo X. who was then Pope, was as desirous of extend∣ing literature as some of his predecessors had been of spreading ignorance; he therefore en∣tertained the Grecian exiles, and encouraged letters among the clergy. At this time Europe was in a more pacific state: England breathed after the long wars between York and Lancas∣ter: France, from being divided among a num∣ber
<PB N="208" REF="030190_0213_0FE5077EC25077E0"/>
of independent nobles, each able to awe the titular King, became one powerful monar∣chy: the Moors were driven out of Spain, and that whole country, which had formed many separate kingdoms, was united by the marriage of Ferdinand of Castile and Isabella of Arra∣gon: Germany was one large republic of Prin∣ces, of whom the Emperor was the head; and Italy was divided into many small states, the chief of which were the kingdom of Naples, and the commonwealth of Venice.</P>
<P>The Pope now found his authority shaken. As literature advanced, a spirit of inquiry took place, and the monstrous errours grafted by the church of Rome on the pure religion of Christ began to be perceived. Luther and Calvin published their opinions on this subject, and had many followers, who, from protesting a∣gainst the errours of the church of Rome, ob∣tained the name of Protestants; and their opi∣nions prevailed in England, the northern coun∣tries, and part of Germany and Switzerland.</P>
<P>About this time the art of navigation being greatly improved, a large continent was dis∣covered in the west, called America. Many colonies were soon formed there by the English, French, and Spaniards, which have occasioned frequent wars among those nations. From this period, as commerce has increased, mankind have become more civilized. Religion and politics for a time filled both England and France with intestine commotions. Charles I. of England was brought to the scaffold by his subjects, and Henry IV. of France was stab∣ed by an enthusiast. By the arts of Lewis
<PB REF="030190_0214_0FE507804D86E7E8"/>
XIV. France was brought to be an absolute mo∣narchy, without any legal restraint, indeed, on the power of the crown.</P>
<P>The last king of this potent empire was Lewis XVI. who was born August 23, 1754, married to Maria Antoniette of Austria, May 16, 1770; ascended to the throne upon the death of his grandfather Lewis XV. May 10, 1774; and was crowned at Rheims, June 12, 1775.</P>
<P>About this period Great Britain, through a mistaken policy, differed with her colonies in North America, now the UNITED STATES; and after a fruitless and bloody contest for some years, was compelled to acknowledge them free and independent.</P>
<P>A revolution commences in France July 14th, 1789—Royalty abolished 10th. August 1792—Lewis XVI. ordered for trial to the bar of the convention 11th. December—Sentence of death decreed him, 19th. January 1793, and guillotined 21st. January. His Queen, Maria Antoniette tried and executed 16th. October 1793.</P>
<P>The history of France and Great Britain, eternal rivals in glory and interest, for the two last centuries, is in fact the history of the world. During that period, there has been no war of any consequence between European powers in any part of the world in which they have not acted a principal part; and a war between them extends its influence from the shores of Amer∣ica to the banks of the Ganges. They have been constantly ready to attack each other on the most trivial occasions, and even their trea∣ties of peace have seemed rather cessations of
<PB N="210" REF="030190_0215_0FE507838F23EE48"/>
hostilities for the purpose of renewing them with greater vigour, than any permanent re∣conciliation. When and how the present fruitless and wanton quarrel (on the part of Great Britain) may terminate, time must deve∣lope; for the sake of humanity we wish it at an end, and that the future contests of all-mankind may be, who shall excel most in arts of peace and the pursuits of literature!</P>

<HEAD>THE ELEPHANT.</HEAD>
<P>NEXT to Man, the Elephant is the most res∣pectable of the Almighty's creatures. In size he exceeds all other terrestrial animals; and by his understanding he approaches nearly to the human species. His temper is naturally gentle. Even while wild in the forests he thirsts not after blood, nor does he use his vast strength, except in defending himself or pro∣tecting his companions. His favourite food is rice, roots, and herbs; he abhors fish and flesh. When he finds a plentiful pasture, he makes use of a particular cry, which gives notice to his comrades to come and partake of the dain∣ties which he has found. An invitation which they readily obey, to the great loss of the own∣er of the land.—The Elephant is caught and tamed without difficulty. His love of society renders him easy to be allured into a snare by others of his own species, who have been edu∣cated
<PB N="217" REF="030190_0222_0FE507A200091438"/>
for that purpose. Two of these, after he is in confinement, constantly attend all his motions, and, when he is not disposed to sub∣mit, compel him by striking him with their trunks to obedience. Very soon, however, his own astonishing judgment convinces him that no harm, is meant to him, and that his efforts towards resistance are all in vain. In conse∣quence of this, he applies himself to learn his duty, and becomes the mildest and most obe∣dient of all domestic animals. He soon learns to comprehend signs. He distinguishes the tone of command, of anger, and of approbation. He never mistakes the voice of his master, re∣ceives his orders with attention, and executes them with prudence and eagerness, but with∣out precipitation. He seems to take pleasure in being covered with gilded harness and gay housings. He draws carriages, waggons, ar∣tillery, &amp;c. with evenness and good humour, provided he be not treated ill, undeservedly, and that the people who are employed with him have the air of being pleased with his be∣haviour. His conductor (styled his Cornac) generally rides on the Elephant's neck and car∣ries in his hand a sharp iron, with which, when necessary, he pricks the creature's head or ears, to make him move faster; but this is seldom put in practice, since words are always suffici∣ent, provided that the Cornac has had time to acquire the Elephant's confidence; after which the beast's attachment and affection become so strong, that one is actually recorded to have died of grief, because in a fit of passion he had killed his keeper.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="030190_0223_0FE507A843977AB8"/>
Before the invention of gunpowder, Ele∣phants were used in war, and have often by their efforts decided the fate of battles. On their backs they carried small towers which held five or six armed men; and from their trunks hung heavy chains, which they were taught to swing around them in order to break the ranks of the enemy's army. But now that fire is the chief instrument of death in battles, the Ele∣phant, as he is subject to dread both the noise and the flame of fire-arms, would be dangerous to his own party. He is still employed by Euro∣peans in the East for the purpose of transport∣ing the baggage of their troops, and by the In∣dian princes, for carrying their women in large cages covered with green branches of trees.</P>
<P>Elephants are more numerous in Africa than in Asia, the only two parts of the world where they are, naturally, found. In Africa they live uncontrouled, for they despise the ne∣groes as a set of unskilful, weak beings, who have neither strength nor art enough to reduce them to slavery. Those of the Asiatic island, Ceylon, are looked upon as the largest, boldest, and most intelligent of the whole species.</P>
<P>The Elephant is strong in proportion to his vast bulk. He can with ease carry from three to four thousand weight; and on his tusks a∣lone he can support upwards of one thousand pounds. The quickness of his paces, when the immense weight of his body is considered, is a proof of his amazing strength. His usual walk equals the common trot of a horse; and he can run as fast as a horse can gallop. He is gene∣rally permitted to walk when loaded, and can
<PB N="219" REF="030190_0224_0FE507B083899BF0"/>
with ease perform fifty miles in a day, but, when pushed, can go almost twice as far. He will do as much work as six strong horses, but his price is immense, and the charge of main∣taining him very great indeed. An Elephant who has been properly disciplined is worth from four to five hundred guineas; and he will eat in a day above a hundred pounds of rice, besides vegetables. In India all barrels, sacks, and bales of goods are carried from place to place by Elephants, and if their necks and trunks have no more room for burthens, they will carry an additional weight in their mouth. The Elephant unites sagacity with strength, and never injures any thing committed to his charge, be it ever so delicate. He will carry each particular parcel to a boat in his trunk without wetting it; he will range each in order, will try whether each lies firm, and will actual∣ly place stones where necessary to prevent casks from rolling from their proper station.</P>
<P>The trunk (or proboscis) of this wonderful animal ought to be particularly described. It extends itself considerably beyond his mouth, and is terminated by a protuberance which per∣forms all the offices of, and is by no means un∣like to, a finger: with this he can lift the small∣est piece of money from the ground; he can untie knots; he can turn keys, push back bolts, or loosen straps from buckles; and with this he can gratify his sense of smelling (which there is reason to believe to be very exquisite) by ga∣thering flowers, and conveying them to his nose, which, as well as his finger, composes a part of his trunk. The orange tree, in whose
<PB N="220" REF="030190_0225_0FE507B27AD12CB8"/>
flowers he delights, both for their taste and smell, is an object of his most eager pursuit.</P>
<P>The Elephant, when old, suffers great in∣convenience from the increasing size of his large teeth or tusks; to remedy this evil, his natural sagacity prompts him to make two holes in a tree, if wild, or if tamed, in a wall, to support them, and prevent the vast fatigue which his neck endures from their weight. As great part of his skin is tender and delicate, he suffers much from the bites and stings of flies. To prevent this inconvenience, he puts in prac∣tice all the means which his peculiar good sense suggests: if he cannot keep the insects away by brushing them off with branches of trees and whisps of straw, he then wets all the most ex∣posed parts of his body, and gathering dust with his trunk, spreads it carefully over each un∣guarded place.</P>
<P>The height of the creature in his natural state is generally between ten and fourteen feet; but in captivity his growth is considerably checked.</P>
<P>He is nice in many particulars, abhors bad smells, and, probably on that account, dreads the sight, or even the cry of a hog. In eating, let him be ever so hungry, he will fast until he has nicely examined his victuals, and separated from them every particle of dirt, dust, or other uncleanliness.</P>
<P>Both ancient and modern writers dwell with peculiar pleasure on the innumerable instances of instinct, or rather somewhat which ap∣proaches very nearly to reason, in this noble animal; but of these we shall select a few of the best attested.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="030190_0226_0FE507B412471B90"/>
An Elephant had been provoked by ill usage to kill his conductor.—The widow, who had been a witness to the horrid scene, rushed with her two infant children to the enraged animal.—<Q>Here, said she, since you have slain my husband, take my life too, and complete your bloody business by destroying these poor babes!</Q> The beast, apparently hurt at his own excess of passion, lost at once his resent∣ment, and taking the eldest of the children in his trunk, adopted him, as it were for his go∣vernor, and would never suffer any other person to mount his neck.</P>
<P>If the Elephant is revengeful when ill treated, he is truly grateful to those who use him kindly. A soldier in the East Indies had been accustom∣ed, when he received his pay, to treat one of these sensible animals with arrack; one day, having himself partaken too largely of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> liquor, he escaped from a detachment who had been ordered to convey him to prison, and tak∣ing shelter beneath the creature whom he had obliged, he fell fast asleep. His pursuers find∣ing that the Elephant had taken him under his protection, left him, and he, when he awoke, sober, and frightened at his situation, was con∣soled by the caresses of the good-natured ani∣mal, who seemed sensible of the terrours which his benefactor felt, and willing to remove them. An Elephant, in a battle fought not many years ago, having been driven to distraction by the pain of his wounds, ran about the field making the most hideous cries. A wounded soldier of his own party lay just in his way and naturally expected instant destruction. But the
<PB N="222" REF="030190_0227_0FE507B59CD6FAF8"/>
poor tortured animal, conscious that he owed none of his pain to the soldier, took him ten∣derly up with his trunk, and, having placed him out of the common path, continued his route. This anecdote points out the species of excellent reasoning in the Elephant, which pre∣vents him from being provoked, even by the most accute pain, to hurt such as have not in∣jured him: but he must not be wantonly in∣sulted; and even the most trifling affront may expose the giver to a fatal recompence. An Elephant which was kept at Versailles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A palace about ten miles from Paris, where the Kings of France used to have a collection of curious beasts, birds, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE> not many years past, appeared to know when he was mocked by any person, and seldom failed to revenge the insult. A man deceived him, by pretending to throw eatables into his mouth. The animal took his opportunity to knock him down with his trunk, and treated him so se∣verely that he scarcely escaped with life. Ano∣ther time a painter, in order to draw him with his trunk elevated, employed his servant to throw, or pretend to throw, fruit into the Elephant's mouth; the deceitful part of this order was resented by the creature with such ex∣cellent sagacity, that instead of revenging him∣self on the servant, (who appears to have been within his reach,) he squirted such a quantity of water from his trunk at the master, (whom he judiciously discerned to be the contriver of his mortification,) that it utterly ruined the pa∣per on which his work was going forward.</P>
<P>It is recorded, and universally credited, of an Elephant, that as he was passing along a
<PB N="223" REF="030190_0228_0FE507C1E59765D8"/>
street in the city of Delhi, he thrust his trunk in at the window of a room where a tailor sate employed on a rich habit.—This man, dis∣pleased at being interrupted in his work, caused the animal to withdraw in great haste, by pricking him with a needle; provoked at this treatment, the Elephant, who knew that he should pass by the same street again the next day, it being the usual road to his watering place, took care to be prepared for his enemy, by laying in a store of dirty water; this he emptied from his trunk at the same window, and completed his revenge, by thoroughly spoiling the silk on which the tailor was at work.</P>
<P>Accounts hardly credible, although perfect∣ly well attested, are told of the Elephant's sen∣sibility to reproach. One in particular, having been upbraided by his keeper, as a poor indo∣lent creature, for having failed in an effort to set afloat a vessel which lay ashore, an attempt which was really beyond his strength, was so much hurt by the charge, that he made a new trial, succeeded in it, but fell instantly dead, from the damage which he had received in con∣sequence of the exertion.</P>
<P>It has been said before, that mild as the Ele∣phant naturally is, he is not to be trifled with. One of these animals having, with great saga∣city, carried the iron vessel in which he usually drank, to the smith's shop where it used to be repaired; the workman mended it but by halves; the Elephant carried it back, and was severely reproached by his master; who made him comprehend, by showing him how the
<PB N="224" REF="030190_0229_0FE507C379600CA0"/>
water ran out of the vessel, that it needed a farther repair. The animal, as much hurt as if <HI>he</HI> had been accountable for the workman's neglect, snatching the vessel out of the owner's hand, half full of water as it was, carried it in haste to the shop; and as soon as the person who had done his work so ill appeared, the Elephant discharged the water in his face, as a punishment for his misbehaviour.</P>
<P>Hitherto, Mr. Buffon has supplied what has been said of the Elephant; what follows, is chiefly taken from Sparman's account of the Cape of Good Hope.</P>
<P>A female Elephant lost her young one. It seems, that it had fallen into the hands of a party of the native Hottentots, who had killed and devoured it. The mother, the next night, having some how (probably by the scent) dis∣covered the place of its death, attacked the kraal or village in the dark, and utterly destroy∣ed it, by beating down all the huts, and tramp∣ling all the plantations to pieces. And here it may be properly remarked, that the Hotten∣tots eagerly seek the flesh of the Elephant to eat it; which is not the case with any other Af∣rican or Asiatic people, that we read of.</P>
<P>In the country round the Cape, the Elephant is pursued, not to be tamed, but to be slain for the sake of the ivory which his teeth afford. In this chace, the danger to the hunter is great; but the hopes of a large profit (sometimes as much as 300 gilders, or about twenty-six pounds, by a single Elephant) make him close his eyes to all perils. He must be very atten∣tive to approach the animal on the side whence
<PB N="225" REF="030190_0230_0FE507C507002510"/>
the wind blows; for should he be discerned by his piercing scent, the Elephant rushes on him; nor can any thing save him, except a steep hill or wood, either of which circumstances incum∣ber the beast, and save the sportsman. The bullet which is destined to destroy this immense creature, must be made of a proportionable mixture of tin and lead; the piece from whence it is discharged, is generally one of those mus∣quets which were in use about one hundred and eighty years ago, so strong and heavy, as to require a rest to support it when levelled. And yet, when these enormous pieces are deeply loaded, and supplied with proper balls, an Ele∣phant has been known to receive eight wounds in his body, before he was deprived of life.</P>

<HEAD>THE LION.</HEAD>
<P>THE Lion, though inferior in size to seve∣ral other animals which inhabit the same coun∣tries with himself, is so superior in the united qualities of strength, address, and courage, as to have obtained the highest rank amongst the brute creation. Even the cumbrous Elephant, and the robust Buffalo, are conquered by this lordly beast, who proudly subdues and preys upon all, but is himself the prey of none. Nor is his courage less remarkable than his strength. The fierce Lion, who has been used to con∣quer, and is ignorant of the superior power of man, will sometimes rush upon a caravan which
<PB N="226" REF="030190_0231_0FE507C86A25EAC0"/>
is travelling through the deserts; and such is his contempt of danger, that when he is re∣pulsed, he does not turn his back and endea∣vour to escape, but retreats sighting, and de∣fending himself against the attacks of his ene∣mies. The largest Lions are about eight or nine feet in length, and three or four feet in height: their colour is yellow on the back, and a dusky white on the sides and belly. The male Lion is adorned with a large flowing mane, which grows larger as he advances in years; but the female is without this ornament, and is about one-fourth less in size. In general the Lioness is much more docile and gentle than the Lion; but when she has young, she becomes still fiercer than he, and will attack a number of armed men in defence of her whelps. Her care to secure them from disco∣very is shown before their birth; she retires to the least frequented places, and when they are brought forth, she is so careful to preserve them, that when she leaves them to procure food, she carefully brushes away the marks of her feet with her tail, that her young may not be disco∣vered by the prints of her steps. The Lion is an inhabitant of warm climates, and is never found in the frozen regions of the North. In∣deed the strength and fierceness of this terrible animal appear to be greatly increased by the heat of the climate he inhabits; and there is a remarkable difference between the ferocity of those Lions which breathe the temperate air of lofty mountains and of those which dwell in the sandy and scorching plains. The American Lions, which are natives of a milder climate, have neither the fierceness, the strength, nor
<PB N="227" REF="030190_0232_0FE507D1444DDE20"/>
the courage of those born under the fervid rays of an Indian or African sun; nor are they a∣dorned with a mane. Indeed, their differing in so many respects has made several Naturalists very doubtful whether or not they were of the true Lion species.</P>
<P>Though the Lion is naturally an inhabitant of hot countries, he can subsist a long time in more temperate climates. Several have lived during many years in Europe, and some have brought forth young, and attained to a consi∣derable age, in Britain. The time which has been supposed the usual term of their lives is between twenty and twenty-five years. Their numbers have been greatly lessened by the in∣crease of the human species, and the invention of fire-arms; and though many still inhabit the southern parts of Africa and Asia, and are very fierce and dreadful, yet they are no longer found in very large numbers. Those Lions which dwell near the villages of India or Bar∣bary, have so often experienced the superior powers of man, that they have lost much of their native fierceness, and, if forced by hunger or provoked by the attacks of men, they attempt to assault them, they approach with great cau∣tion and signs of fear. It is however asserted, that if this fierce beast has conquered, and has once tasted human flesh, he will never after∣wards prey with equal pleasure upon any other animal.</P>
<P>When the Lion prepares to attack his prey, he generally makes use of stratagem to ensure his success He lies in wait near the springs where the animals go to drink, couched upon
<PB N="228" REF="030190_0233_0FE507D2CF385CC0"/>
his belly, darts upon them as they pass, and seldom misses his aim, though he frequently makes a leap twelve or fifteen feet in length. As he neither hears nor sees very well, though he has the faculty of seeing in the night, he is known to employ great watchfulness to procure his prey; and is obliged to keep at a conside∣rable distance from the animal he means to at∣tack, who would, if he came nearer, soon dis∣cover him by his strong scent. Springs and fountains are very agreeable to him, not only on account of their being frequented by other animals, but also from the great thirstiness of the Lion; for though he is able to support great hunger, he suffers much from thirst. When he attacks the Buffalo, he rushes upon him unseen, fastens his two fore paws upon his mouth and nostrils, and does not resign his hold till the animal is quite strangled; he then sometimes tears out the entrails that he may remove the body with more ease, and drags it to a retreat, where he may enjoy his feast in security.</P>
<P>All animals appear to have a natural dread of the Lion, and travellers have frequently been acquainted with their approach by the uneasiness of their cattle. The oxen and hor∣ses sigh deeply, and show every appearance of terrour, and the dogs creep close to the feet of their masters, and are afraid even to bark. At the sound of his terrible voice the affrighted animals run wildly about to avoid him; but as he lays his mouth to the ground when he utters his deep continued roars, the sound is so dif∣fused, that they know not whence it proceeds,
<PB N="229" REF="030190_0234_0FE507D45A83AC88"/>
and they frequently advance to the very spot where he stands ready to devour them. But terrible as the Lion is to every other animal, he is so inferior to man, that he is not only fre∣quently taken in toils which are formed to de∣stroy him, but is even hunted for amusement. The inhabitants of the southern parts of Afri∣ca, mounted on horseback, frequently pursue and kill him, and they esteem his flesh both pleasant and nourishing. His skin, which in some countries has been used as a royal mantle, is however regarded as very inferior in real use∣fulness to the hide of an Ox.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the Cape of Good Hope, who are much infested by Lions, which devour their flocks, make use of many artifices to de∣stroy them. In travelling in the night, they are obliged to be pretty constantly upon their guard against this fierce animal, though he sel∣dom attacks them in the day, except he is very hungry, or greatly provoked. A Hottentot, who was travelling to a considerable distance, observed that he was followed by one of these formidable animals, which kept several yards behind him, but advanced with exactly the same speed. Sensible of the cunning of the Lion, who seldom attacks his prey openly, the traveller concluded that he only waited for the approach of darkness to rush upon him; and as he was without weapons, and at a great dis∣tance from any habitation, he was in the ut∣most danger of being torn in pieces by his pur∣suer. His knowledge of the manners of the animal, and his own ingenuity, furnished him, however, with the means to escape. He care∣fully
<PB N="230" REF="030190_0235_0FE507D7E2B98AA8"/>
sought for some rocky place, which was level at the top, and had a deep precipice on one side; and seating himself on the brink, he prepared for the part he was to act to save him∣self from destruction, while his enemy lay couched upon the ground, and steadily observ∣ing him. As soon as it became dusk, the Hottentot, gently sliding forwards, let himself down upon a small part of the rock which pro∣jected just below him, and which was just large enough to support him; but in order to de∣ceive the Lion, he raised his stick, upon which he had placed his hat and cloak, and made a gentle motion with it just above his head, at a small distance from the edge of the mountain. This stratagem had the desired success. The Lion crept gently towards the stick, which he mistook for the man, and then bounded upon it, with so exact an aim as to fall down the precipice close to the spot where the Hottentot had placed the snare.</P>
<P>There are few dispositions so savage that they may not be tamed by kindness, and even the ferocious Lion has afforded the strongest proofs of attachment and gratitude for the benefits he has received. The celebrated Earl of Peter∣borough, when a boy, was presented with a young Lion, which he greatly delighted to ca∣ress and to feed; and the animal became so tame as to suffer his lordship to play with him, with the familiarity of a brother. They grew up together, and their intimacy had continued several years, when the Earl was appointed by Queen Ann to the command of her army in Spain. His promotion did not, however, make
<PB N="231" REF="030190_0236_0FE507E1D5B9AD10"/>
him forgetful of his old friend the Lion; he gave strict orders to his housekeeper to take care of his playfellow. The animal showed great concern at the absence of his lordship, sensibly pined for his loss, and refused his food; and the Earl, in order to preserve his life, or∣dered him to be presented to her Majesty, in hopes that the society of the other animals in the Tower would make him forget his old friend. A long time passed before the return of the Earl from Spain, who brought over with him a Spanish officer whom he had taken pri∣soner. His humanity made him desirous of making the captivity of the Spaniard as easy as possible; and in hopes of amusing him, he took him to view whatever was curious, in or near London, and amongst other places they visited the Tower. Here the Earl was received by a roar of joy from his old companion, who immediately knew him, and showed the great∣est transports at the return of his benefactor; nor did he suffer him to depart, till, in the excess of his rapture, he had deprived his lordship of nearly the whole of his coat, though he very carefully avoided injuring his person.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE TWO-HORNED RHINOCEROS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS animal is sound in Africa, chiefly a∣bout the Cape of Good Hope, and is distin∣guished from the common or one-horned Rhinoceros, as well as from all other beasts, by having two horns upon its nose, the larger of which stands foremost towards the muzzle or snout of the animal, the shorter behind it, and higher up towards the forehead. The fore∣most horn grows almost to the length of two feet, and seven or eight inches thick at the bottom; the hindmost sometimes measures so long as sixteen inches, and proportionably thick. They are of a conical shape, with the tips inclined somewhat backwards, but their size does not always appear to be in propor∣tion to the body. This species of Rhinoce∣ros is endued with prodigious strength, and, though little inferiour in size to the Elephant, and somewhat resembling it in its enormous unwieldy make, runs with astonishing swift∣ness. It harbours amongst close thickets and bushy copses, from whence it comes forth in the cool of the evening, to graze for the night. Its food consists of plants and roots, with the
<PB N="233" REF="030190_0238_0FE507E4EB7C6A70"/>
tops of shrubs, and small branches of trees. The roots it is supposed to dig up with the smallest of its horns, as this, especially in the older animals, is most commonly observed to be worn away in different parts, which is never the case in the foremost and larger one. It is natural to suppose that this latter is the offen∣sive weapon of the animal, and is therefore never used in the servile employment of digging for its food, at which time it is turned on one side, out of the way; for these horns are said to be so loose and moveable, that when the Rhinoceros walks carelessly along, one may see its horns dangle about, and hear them clash and clatter against each other. The shrubs and plants, which also compose part of its food, it clips off with its lips, not having any fore teeth for that purpose, Indeed it has little room for them, as the mouth goes off so sharp at the fore part (something like that of a Tortoise) that it is only an inch and a half broad. Be∣sides, it has no occasion for any teeth there, the skin which forms the lips being of the ex∣treme hardness, that it can perform the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of teeth very well, and that with so much the great∣er ease, as the under jaw goes within the upper.</P>
<P>The tongue is perfectly soft, which directly contradicts the common notion that the Rhi∣noceros kills by licking with his tongue.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the formidable bulk and amazing strength of this animal, which has been known to run up to a waggon and carry it to a considerable distance on its snout and horns, the Hottentots and the Dutch farmers <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> live in the inland parts round the Cape of
<PB N="234" REF="030190_0239_0FE507E8E36FDE70"/>
Good Hope, frequently attack and overpower it. For the purpose of shooting it they use balls made of lead and tin mixt, and having found out its retirement, they approach it on the side opposite to that from which the wind blows. This precaution is absolutely necessary on ac∣count of the very acute smell and hearing with which the animal is endued. At the least noise more than usual, it takes the alarm, and erect∣ing its ears, stands clapping with them and list∣ening; and if the hunter be so imprudent as to get to the windward of it, even at a great dis∣tance, it seldom fails directly to follow him by the scent and attack him with the greatest fury. Being therefore pretty secure on the side of the wind, the Rhinoceros has the sagacity in gene∣ral to choose, by way of entrenchment, a bush very thick, and high on that side from whence it has no scent. If wounded it rushes out from the thickets into the plain, when the boldest sportsmen prudently consult their safety by flight. It soon, however, turns aside, and if there be no copse convenient for its escape, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> off straight forward over the plain; if they happen to have hounds out with them, these pursue it, and form a strong contrast to the colossal size of the animal, which, how∣ever, seems not to take the least notice of them. With a gentle rise and fall of the neck it keeps on an even steady course, a kind of pacing, which nevertheless gets over a great deal of ground: but this pace, on hearing a few shots fired after it, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to a very fast gallop, so as in an instant <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ave the hounds at a great distance behind; and, in all probability, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="235" REF="030190_0240_0FE507F005CF2EC0"/>
sportsman would inevitably be lost, who should happen to become the object of its pursuit, if he had not art enough to get out of the sight and scent of it by shifting and dodging occa∣sionally. In this particular the Rhinoceros is said to resemble the Elephant, that without de∣laying or stopping in the least, it will run to the distance of many leagues from the place where it has been closely hunted, or in any other way molested.</P>
<P>The two-horned Rhinoceros sleeps in a different posture from the Elephant; it lies down on the ground on one side, and withal is said to sleep so sound, that the Hottentots and Dutch colonists frequently steal upon it while in that situation, and shoot it; it differs very much in this respect from the common or one-horned Rhinoceros, which is described as by no means a sleepy animal. If it happens not to die immediately of its wounds, the Hottentot hunters will nevertheless follow the traces of it for one or more days, till it drops down with weakness and fatigue. In general, however, they poison one or two of their darts <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they attack it, in which case they have no oc∣casion to wait so many days as they otherwise would before their prey falls into their hands.</P>
<P>Fortunately for those who attack the Rhi∣noceros, with all its keenness of smell and hearing, it labours under the disadvantage of being extremely near-sighted. In effect, its eyes are very small and sunk into its head, which is perhaps the reason <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it sees but in∣distinctly, and that only straight forward, so as <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to perceive a horseman at the distance
<PB N="236" REF="030190_0241_0FE507F392787848"/>
of fifty or sixty yards upon the open plain, unless directed by its scent or hearing to fix upon the object. Whenever therefore it hap∣pens to receive a wound without being able to discover from what hand it proceeds, this cir∣cumstance seems to provoke it to a greater de∣gree of fury. Not knowing where to wreak its vengeance, it swings the fore part of its body violently from one side to the other, and snuffs up with its nostrils as if endeavouring to disco∣ver the enemy by its smell. The noise which it makes with its nose upon such occasions is particularly terrible to the horses of those who are in chace of it: for when wounded, it will snuff and blow so hard and so loud as to startle them, and make them uneasy, at the distance of some hundreds of yards. Indeed, instinct sufficiently informs the horse of its danger, when the Rhinoceros is nigh, not only by the hear∣ing but by the smell also; for whenever the sportsmen approach its retreat, which is always done against the wind, the horses having the advantage of the breeze, are enabled to disco∣ver their tremendous enemy so far off as forty or fifty yards by the smell: upon this they im∣mediately stop, and give evident proofs of ter∣ror by their unwilliness to proceed any farther.</P>
<P>This animal is of a greyish or ash colour, but, which is very remarkable, seems to change its hue, and become almost black upon being hard hunted. This is owing probably to the dust and dried mud that sticks to its skin (as it is very fond <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>rolling and wallowing in the mire), and when moistened by sweat, becomes much darker in colour. About the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="237" REF="030190_0242_0FE507F531B30D90"/>
however, where the skin is not so thick as on the rest of the body, and almost quite smooth, it is nearly the colour of a man's flesh. On all other parts the surface of the skin is rough and knotty, and not much differing from that of an Elephant, but of a closer texture, and when it is dry, extremely hard. It has not, however, any of those plaits and folds which are to be observed in the common descriptions and fi∣gures published of it, and which give it the ap∣pearance of being covered with a harness. The hide is an inch and a half thick on the back, and somewhat thicker on the sides, though less compact there. It is, however, by no means impenetrable, as has been commonly supposed. Leaden balls indeed will sooner be flattened a∣gainst the skin than pierce it; but when they are hardened by a proper mixture of tin, the Rhinoceros may be killed by a single shot. Nay, its hide, as well as that of the Elephant, is capable of being penetrated by javelins and darts. A Hottentot, at the distance of five or six paces, has been known to pierce through the hide of a Rhinoceros half a foot deep into its body. Some have also imagined it to pos∣sess no feeling in its skin; but, besides what is mentioned of the common Rhinoceros, that it is capable of being tickled under the belly with a whisp of straw, the Two-horned Rhinoceros is fond (as was mentioned before) of wallowing in the mire like a hog, which would hardly be the case were its hide absolutely insensible; and indeed, when the thick hide of an Elephant is affected by the stinging of flies, we cannot sup∣pose that of the Rhinoceros to be totally des∣titute
<PB N="238" REF="030190_0243_0FE507F6C0133DC8"/>
of feeling. Its skin, though tough and close in its texture, has, particularly about the groin, vessels, blood, and juices, adapted for the nourishment of insects; and in effect this animal is found to be infested in that part with a particular species of insect; neither does the thickness of its hide hinder it from perspiring. Lastly, the Rhinoceros here described may be said to be totally destitute of hair, though there are a few scattered dark bristly hairs, about an inch long, on the edges of the ears, with a very few between and round about the horns, and at the tip of the tail. This part of the animal is about an inch thick, diminishing by degrees from the root to the tip, where it is flattened at the sides; and on the edges, produced by this flatness, are to be seen some strong stiff hairs, an inch or an inch and a half in length. Such of them as stand towards the creature's hard and rough body are visibly worn down and stunted.</P>
<P>Of the inward parts of this animal, it is sufficient to observe, that its flesh, when drest, taste a good deal like pork, but much coarser. Its brain are less than those of a middle-sized man; like the horse, it has no gall; its en∣trails also most resemble those of a horse: so that this beast, notwithstanding its being fur∣nished with horns, does by no means belong to the class of those which chew the cud, but rather of those whose fat is of a soft nature like lard, and not hard like tallow. The stomach, however, does not bear the least resemblance to that of a horse, but rather to that of a man or hog; and the contents of it, when opened,
<PB N="239" REF="030190_0244_0FE50805E39F1848"/>
after the animal has been lately killed, are usually without smell, and perfectly fresh and sweet, consisting of roots and small branches of trees chewed, some of them as big as the end of a man's finger; and of succulent plants, the whole diffusing around a very strong and not disagreeable aromatic odour.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="description">
<HEAD>OF THE HUMMING-BIRD.</HEAD>
<P>OF this charming little animal, there are six or seven varieties, from the size of a small wren, down to that of an humble bee. An European could never have supposed a bird existing so very small, and yet completely furnished out with a bill, feathers, wings, and intestines, ex∣actly resembling those of the largest kind. A bird not so big as the end of one's little finger, would probably be supposed but a creature of imagination, were it not seen in infinite num∣bers, and as frequent as butterflies in a sum∣mer's day, sporting in the fields of America, from flower to flower, and extracting their sweets with its little bill.</P>
<P>The smallest humming-bird is about the size of an hazel-nut. The feathers on its wings and tail are black; but those on its body and under its wings, are of a greenish brown, with a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> red cast or gloss, which no silk or velvet can imitate. It has a small crest on its head, green at the bottom, and as it were gilded at the top; and which sparkles in the sun like a little star in the middle of its forehead. The bill is
<PB N="240" REF="030190_0245_0FE5080793529C08"/>
black, straight, slender, and of the length of a small pin. The largest humming-bird is near half as big as the common wren, and without a crest on its head; but to make amends, it is covered, from the throat half way down the belly, with changeable crimson-coloured fea∣thers, which, in different lights, change to a variety of beautiful colours, much like an opal. The heads of both are small, with very little round eyes as black as jet.</P>
<P>It is inconceivable how much these add to the high finishing and beauty of a rich luxuri∣ous western landscape. As soon as, the sun is risen, the humming-birds, of different kinds, are seen fluttering about the flowers, without ever lighting upon them Their wings are in such rapid motion, that it is impossible to dis∣cern their colours, except by their glittering. They are never still, but continually in moti∣on, visiting flower after flower, and extracting its honey. For this purpose they are furnished with a forked tongue, that enters the cup of the flower, and extracts its nectared tribute. Upon this alone they subsist. The rapid mo∣tion of their wings brings out a humming sound, whence they have their name.</P>
<P>The nests of these birds are not less curious than the rest: they are suspended in the air, at the point of the twigs of an orange, a pome∣granate, or a citron tree; sometimes even in houses, if they find a small and convenient twig for the purpose. The female is the architect, while the male goes in quest of materials; such as cotton, file moss, and the fibres of vegeta∣bles. The nest is about the size of an men's
<PB N="241" REF="030190_0246_0FE508091D38B298"/>
egg cut in two. They lay two eggs at a time, and never more, about the size of small peas, and as white as snow, with here and there a yel∣low speck. The time of incubation contin∣ues twelves days; at the end of which the young ones appear, and are much about the size of a blue-bottle-fly.</P>
<P>It is a doubt whether or not these birds have a continued note in singing. All travellers agree that, beside the humming noise produced by their wings they have a little interrupted chirrup; but Labat asserts, that they have a most pleasing melancholy melody in their voices, though small and proportioned to the organs which produce it. It is very probable that, in different places, their notes are also different; and as there are some that continue torpid all the winter, there may likewise be some with agreeable voices, though the rest may in general be silent.</P>

<HEAD>THE NIGHTINGALE.</HEAD>
<P>THE NIGHTINGALE is the most famous of the feathered tribe. It visits England in the be∣ginning of April, and leaves it in August. It is found but in some of the southern parts of that country, being totally unknown in Scot∣land, Ireland, or North Wales. They fre∣quent
<PB N="242" REF="030190_0247_0FE5080AA8BB3F00"/>
thick hedges and low coppices, and ge∣nerally keep in the middle of the bush, so that they are rarely seen. They begin their song in the evening, and generally continue it for the whole night. For weeks together, if undis∣turbed, they sit upon the same tree; and Shake∣spear rightly describes the nightingale sitting nightly in the same place.</P>
<P>In the begining of May, the nightingale prepares to make its nest, which is formed of the leaves of trees, straw, and moss. The nest being very eagerly sought after, is as cunning∣ly secreted; so that but very few of them are found by the boys when they go upon these pursuits. It is built at the bottom of hedges, where the bushes are thickest and best covered. While the female continues sitting, the male at a good distance, but always within hearing, cheers the patient hen with his voice, and, by the short interruption of his song, often gives her warning of approaching danger. She lays four or five eggs; of which but a part, in that cold climate, come to maturity.</P>
<P>The delicacy, or rather the fame, of this bird's music, has induced many to abridge its liberty to secure its harmony. Its song, how∣ever, in captivity is not so very alluring; and the tyranny of taking it from those hedges where only it is most pleasing, still more depreciates its imprisoned efforts. Gesner assures us, that it is not only the most agreeable songster in a cage, but that it is possessed of a most admira∣ble faculty of talking. He tells the following story in proof of his assertion, which he says was communicated to him by a friend. <Q>Whilst
<PB N="243" REF="030190_0248_0FE50817975680A8"/>
I was at Ratisbone, says his correspondent, I put up at an inn, the sign of the Golden Crown, where my host had three nightin∣gales. It happened at that time, being the spring of the year, when those birds are ac∣customed to sing, that I was so afflicted with the stone, that I could sleep but very little all night. It was usual then about mid∣night to hear the two nightingales jangling. and talking with each other, and plainly im∣itating men's discourses. Besides repeating the daily discourse of the guests, they chant∣ed out two stories. One of their stories was concerning the tapster and his wise, who re∣fused to follow him to the wars as he desired her; for the husband endeavoured to per∣suade his wife, as far as I understood by the buds, that he would leave his service in that inn, and go to the wars in hopes of plunder. But she refused to follow him, resolving to stay either at Ratisbone, or go to Nuremberg. There was a long and earnest contention be∣tween them; and all this dialogue the birds repeated. The other story was concerning the war which the emperor was then threatening against the protestants; which the birds pro∣bably heard from some of the generals that had conferences in the house. These things did they repeat in the night after twelve o'clock, when there was a deep silence. But in the day time, for the most part, they were silent, and seemed to do nothing but meditate and revolve with themselves upon what the guests conferred together as they sat at table, or in their walks.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="030190_0249_0FE4FE8AC523DF48"/>
Such is the sagacity ascribed to the nightin∣gale. But there is a little bird, rather celebrat∣ed for its affection to mankind than its singing, which however, in a British climate, has the sweetest note of all others. The reader already perceives that I mean the RED-BREAST, the well∣known friend of man, that is found in every hedge, and makes it vocal. The note of other birds is louder, and their inflections more ca∣pricious; but this bird's voice is soft, tender, and well supported; and the more to be valued as it is enjoyed the greatest part of the winter. If the nightingale's song has been compared to the fiddle, the red-breast's voice has all the delicacy of the flute.</P>

<HEAD>THE THREE BROTHERS.</HEAD>
<P>EUGENE, RICHARD, and CASSANDER, were the sons of Mr. Smithson, a reputable mer∣chant in the North of Old England, who hav∣ing no other children besides them, and being in pretty affluent circumstances, resolved to have them educated immediately under his own eye. For this purpose he invited into his house a Mr. Markham, a gentleman of learning and approved morals, to be their tutor, whose care and attention to their improvement afterwards fully answered all his expectations.</P>
<P>These Three Brothers, from their earliest in∣fancy, were play-mates and companions. They had never been sent out of their father's house, either to nurse or even to a school: as Mrs. Smithson, their mother, whose education ren∣dered her perfectly equal to the task, under∣took to put them through the first rudiments of learning, and to prepare them for whatever studies a tutor might afterwards direct them to. Whether it was their constant society from their earliest childhood; in the course of which, notwithstanding the difference of two years, be∣tween
<PB N="246" REF="030190_0251_0FE4FE970A09B7A8"/>
the age of Cassander and that of Eugene, each shared invariably in the studies as well as the amusements of the other two; or whether it was the natural bent of their dispositions, I know not, but they were remarkable for bear∣ing towards each other a degree of affection that is rarely to be found amongst brothers in general. In their sports they were inseparable; the inequality of their number was never an ob∣stacle to their all partaking of the same pastime, though it might originally have been intended but for two; and notwithstanding there would now and then arise a trifling dispute amongst them concerning their play, all differences were usually settled and reconciled before the con∣clusion of the game, so that they never parted from each other in a pet; but, on the contrary, after they were tired of play, it was no un∣common thing to see them linked all three arm in arm, sauntering up and down the gar∣den walks, which were commonly the scene of their amusements; and in that friendly at∣titude communicating to each other their little fancies, discussing the remarkale stories that occurred in the course of their lessons, or else laying their heads together to plan and strike out some new mode of diversion.</P>
<P>Thus agreeing, and unanimous in all things, they entered with pleasure upon the course of study laid down to them by Mr. Markham, their tutor. Mrs. Smithson had never, while her sons were under her care, made their les∣sons a painful or disagreeable task; the novelty therefore of Mr. Markham's first examination, under whom they found that they were to learn
<PB N="247" REF="030190_0252_0FE4FE9A2921A9C0"/>
both Latin and Greek, so charmed and de∣lighted them, that they all three jumped for joy when their Papa showed them three Latin Grammars, which they were to begin the next day.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Besides, their satisfaction at not being o∣bliged to leave their dear parents, nor to be se∣parated from each other, might not a little con∣tribute to the alacrity they showed on this oc∣casion. In effect the quickness of their pro∣gress surprized and delighted Mr. Markham,
<PB N="248" REF="030190_0253_0FE4FEA2A7825970"/>
their present tutor, as well as their former one, that is their Mama, to whom they would run every day in raptures of joy to communicate the contents of their several lessons.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have seen Eugene, Richard and Cassander, perfectly alike and equal in all things; it is necessary now to show in what res∣pects they were unlike, and how the particular character and disposition of each, though lead∣ing to actions extremely different from what the others would pursue, yet always uniformly concurred in the exertion of that amiable prin∣ciple, brotherly love.</P>
<P>Eugene, therefore, with much generosity and something of fire in his composition, was at the same time a little arch, or what is called waggish. His pranks in general were the most innocent in the world, it is true, and he could say at least, that he never meant to hurt: if, however, it would sometimes happen, which after all was seldom the case, that any of his little jokes cost either of his brothers a tear; that tear, it was easy to be seen, gave Eugene infinitely more pain than any he himself shed: but the open frankness and ardent good-nature, with which he would console his weeping bro∣ther, seldom failed to dry it up in a moment. He would never justify his own mistakes or his awkwardness; and thus he seldom felt the re∣proaches of his companions, because they al∣ways found him ready to submit to them can∣didly, and, whenever it so happened, to own himself in the fault.</P>
<P>Richard, on the other hand, was all simpli∣city: he had not the least shadow of design in
<PB N="249" REF="030190_0254_0FE4FEA4A36FC700"/>
him; and were it not for the extraordinary ap∣prehension that he showed in his learning, in which he outstripped both his brothers, he might be said not to have a thought of his own. Thus Richard, though as cheerful as the day, seldom laughed unless Eugene or Cassander led the joke. He never proposed a new sort of play, or invented a fresh plaything, but always was ready, with the greatest good humour, to join in the one and admire the other, if offered to his attention by either of his brothers. He might even be said to have no wants or likings of his own, but as they put him in mind of them. If Eugene said to the maid, "Molly, I want to go to bed;" Richard would add, "so do I too." If Cassander said, "Mama, pray give me a piece of bread and butter," Richard, it present, would commonly join, "Aye, and me too." And this disposition of Richard was the happiest in the world; for preserving the friend∣ship of the Three Brothers; since, whatever advantage or superiority he might have in his learning, all his amusements, all the pleasure that he enjoyed from society, depended wholly on Eugene and Cassander.</P>
<P>This last was neither so volatile as his elder brother, nor so simple as Richard: he had something grave even in his countenance, and though youngest of the three, was allowed to be much the most prudent; by which means he balanced, as it were, the opposite defects of his brothers, and frequently would act as their adviser and censor, by reproving Eugene for his too great vivacity, which led him so often into scrapes, and Richard for his thoughtless absence and extreme credulity. But though
<PB N="250" REF="030190_0255_0FE4FDBB8579E6B8"/>
he sometimes took this freedom, it was always with the greatest tenderness, being accustomed from his infancy to treat his elders with respect, particularly his brothers. Indeed a respect for their elders and superiors Mrs. Smithson took early care to inculcate on the minds of all her children. Richard was commanded, to yield in every thing to Eugene, and Cassander to Richard; and all three to behave with proper deference to those who were more advanced in life than themselves. This injunction had a good effect more ways than one: it prevented any childish contests for the preference, as each knew and was contented with his own rank, and always waited his proper turn. Besides, it made them behave with good manners to strangers, let their condition in life be what it will; nor was any one of them ever known to speak or act with petulance even to a beggar.</P>
<P>After remaining a competent time under the instruction of Mr. Markham, it was their fa∣ther's pleasure that they should all three enter the University together, and pursue their studies there, in order to qualify themselves for what∣ever of the learned professions they might af∣terwards choose. This circumstance gave them infinite pleasure. The love that they bore to each other while children, was now ripening into a steady, ardent friendship, which no time could alter or diminish; and they saw before them a prospect of being happy in each other's society during the whole course of their lives. But human events are uncertain, and the shades of misfortune often intervene unexpectedly to chequer the most equal and placid sunshine of
<PB N="251" REF="030190_0256_0FE4FEA94EB7D668"/>
prosperity. Mr. Smithson was still in trade, and therefore liable to accidents and crosses which merchants frequently experience. It hap∣pened, in the beginning of the war, that two ships, containing property of his to a very con∣siderable amount, uninsured, were taken by the enemy. The deficiency produced in his capital by this misfortune, joined to several other smaller losses, obliged Mr. Smithson to become a bankrupt; after which, conceiving a distaste to his native place, he determined to take a voyage to the West Indies, in order to look after an estate in land which had been be∣queathed him as a legacy by some distant rela∣tion since the time of his failure. At his de∣parture, not judging it expedient to take his wife along with him, he left her a small sum of ready money, but promised to send over remit∣tances whenever the property, of which he went to take possession, could be turned to any account.</P>
<P>Our Three Brothers were inconsolable at parting with their father: this was the first time in their lives that they might be said to feel the grief of absence from their beloved parents; for while at College they could hardly be called absent from home, as they conversed weekly, nay almost daily, by letters, either with Mr. or Mrs. Smithson. But their sorrow was con∣siderably increased, when, after two years had elapsed without any tidings from their father, they received a melancholy epistle from Mrs. Smithson, informing them of her utter inability to maintain them any longer at College, and requesting their immediate return, in order to
<PB N="252" REF="030190_0257_0FE4FEA63353CD10"/>
consult how they should dispose of themselves for their future settlement in life.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>During the last two years that they had spent at the University, nothing but the strict∣est economy, on the part of the Brothers, as well as that of their indulgent parent, could have enabled them to subsist; yet notwithstand∣ing the general dissipation of the place, their temperance and frugality did not hinder them from supporting an amiable character, and be∣ing highly esteemed by all who knew them. They were remarked for an obliging, affable demeanour, an unexceptionable attention to their College duties, but particularly for the strict intimacy and happy degree of unanimity which they always appeared to maintain. They were indeed distinguished by the title of the <HI>Three Brothers;</HI> and the wits of the place spoke of them as an exception to that remark of the poet
<Q><L>Friendship, like love, is but a name,</L>
<L>Unless to one you stint the flame,</L></Q>
<PB N="253" REF="030190_0258_0FE4FDB39FB0B390"/>
However, there was a considerable difference in their dispositions, which, without the least impairing their affection, grew every day more and more conspicuous. Eugene was now am∣bitious, enterprising, and changeable: his parts were rather brilliant than solid. Cassander, on the contrary, was steady in his opinions and re∣solutions, which he built on the soundest and most mature reflexion: he appeared more slow in apprehending the difficulties of science than his elder brother; but, in return, his memory was more faithful and retentive, and whatever knowledge he once made his own was ever af∣ter at his command; for, as Mr. Pope elegant∣ly observes,
<Q><L>Where beams of warm imagination play,</L>
<L>The memory's soft figures melt away</L></Q>
Richard was a sort of <HI>medium</HI> between these opposites: with something of Fugene's viva∣city and the steadiness of Cassander, he had an ardent and insatiable thirst of knowledge; in effect, he had recommended himself so power∣fully to his superiors, by the extent and splen∣dour of his attainments, that he was at this very time of Mrs. Smithson's writing for him and his brothers, pointed out to a nobleman, equally respectable for his rank and principles, as a proper person to be private tutor to his Lordship's two sons, who were lately entered at the University.</P>
<P>At their return, therefore, upon the sum∣mons of their mother, when she laid before them the melancholy state of their affairs, the disappointment of their expectations, and, to
<PB N="254" REF="030190_0259_0FE4FEB2CABDF060"/>
crown all, the dreadful apprehensions that she entertained of the loss of her husband, either at sea or by the casualties of war; concluding with the tenderest advice to them, to unite their efforts towards the re-establishing of their circumstances by a steady course of industry in whatever professions they might adopt: upon this occasion it was that the advantages of su∣perior application and a more rapid progress in learning appeared conspicuous. While Eugene and Cassander endeavour to comfort Mrs. Smithson by the strongest assurances of their future diligence and the exertion of their in∣dustry in some line or other that might afford themselves and her a decent maintenance, Richard had the happiness of being able to make his mother and brothers the immediate tender of a small competency from the salary which his noble patron was to allow him, who only waited for his answer to invest him with the care of his children's education. This prospect was a seasonable relief to Mrs. Smith∣son from the despondency into which the pre∣sent gloom of her affairs had thrown her. It is true, the iron hand of want had not as yet be∣gun to pinch her and her children, but the near approach of that unwelcome visitor (with∣out such a resource as Richard now suggested), was sufficient to fill her mind with the most melancholy ideas and dismal presages of adver∣sity and distress.</P>
<P>Now therefore at length, by the irresistible decree of necessity, were our Three Brothers obliged to part, and take different walks on the vast theatre of life. Richard, returning to the
<PB N="255" REF="030190_0260_0FE4FEB45F82C5C0"/>
University, attached himself with so much suc∣cess to the education of his noble pupils, and to his own improvement, that, besides being able for the present to contribute to the com∣forts of his mother, and those whom he held most dear next to her, he had the prospect be∣fore him of obtaining an ample settlement in the church, through the interest of his munifi∣cent patron, whose favour he enjoyed in as full a measure as his numerous good qualities enti∣tled him to it. Eugene, having procured re∣commendations to a merchant in London, re∣paired thither, and, applying himself steadily to business, in the course of four years gave such proofs of his integrity and other good qualifica∣tions, that he was taken by the merchant into partnership. Cassander, in the mean time, fearing to become a burthen on the moderate pension that Richard allowed his mother, em∣braced the offer of a Newcastle trader, who, hav∣ing formerly been an intimate friend of Mr. Smithson's agreed to take Cassander a voyage to the East country upon trial. Cassander was still but young, being no more than sixteen at the time of his entering upon a sea life, and af∣ter his voyage of trial he prudently made it his choice, in preference to waiting for the un∣certain chance of some more brilliant establish∣ment. In effect, what with the advantage of an excellent education, a patient and humane disposition, and the uncommon character (for a seaman) of being remarkably sober and fru∣gal, he in a very few years so improved himself in the knowledge of trade and navigation, that he was appointed mate of a vessel trading to
<PB N="256" REF="030190_0261_0FE4FEB5EC193328"/>
Russia, the owners of which were so well pleas∣ed with his activity and good conduct, that they were determined, notwithstanding his youth, to send him out master of one of their ships, the first opportunity that offered.</P>
<P>Thus, for some years after the separation of the Three Brothers, fortune seemed to recom∣pense the severe loss that they had felt in the person of their father, concerning whom, all this time, notwithstanding every possible in∣quiry, not the smallest intelligence had been received. But now, alas! once more, sorrow and adversity came hand in hand to disquiet the feeling hearts of our three youths, by an hour of trial such as they had never yet experienced. The news of their mother's death was the se∣vere prelude to their misfortunes. Richard had scarcely recovered the shock of this, when the death of his patron totally dissipated all the flattering hopes that he had formed of fortune and preferment in the church, in which he had already taken orders. Eugene, and his partner had for some time felt their affairs in a critical condition; but this did not hinder him from exerting his native generosity in the service of an ancient friend. Indeed, the voice of friend∣ship and gratitude always met with a favoura∣ble hearing from Eugene, let their summons be ever so pressing and importunate. His old tutor, Mr. Markham, under whom he and his brothers had spent some of the happiest years of their life, was at this time in London. Dis∣abled by sickness and infirmity, advancing fast towards helpless old age, and sorely galled by poverty and the neglect of the world, he was
<PB N="257" REF="030190_0262_0FE5071BE76F3AE8"/>
almost without a friend. In this crisis, chance threw his generous pupil in his way, who am∣ply supplied the place of one to him. Besides
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
furnishing him with the means of supplying his present necessities; Eugene, and by his per∣suasion his partner, became security for the payment of a very considerable debt, which was on the point of consigning Mr. Markham to a gaol, where he might probably have passed the remainder of his life. But how ill did for∣tune requite Eugene for this friendly action! Mr. Markham died in less than three months after, when of course the debt devolved upon those who had given security for him. Imme∣diately upon the heels of this misfortune follow∣ed another. The affairs of Eugene's partnership growing desperate, they were obliged to declare themselves bankrupt, and this very kindness which he showed Mr. Markham, was reckoned
<PB N="258" REF="030190_0263_0FE5071DF6F1E718"/>
among the misfortunes that contributed to his ruin. The shock that Eugene's spirits suffered upon this occasion, as he found himself now un∣able to fulfil engagements which he looked up∣on as sacred, drove him from one act of rash∣ness and despair to another; till in the end, re∣duced to extremity of want, in an obscure coun∣try place, he madly and precipitately threw himself among a company of travelling players, and, to crown all, in this unpromising state of life, being barely able to subsist himself, he had the desperate imprudence to marry. It seems he had formed a slight acquaintance with a young lady (the daughter of a clergyman), who was so struck with his figure and accomplishments, that she yielded to his solicitations to be united with him in the ties of clandestine wedlock; thereby utterly forfeiting all her expectations of fortune, together with the friendship of eve∣ry one of her relations. The consequence of this unadvised step, which brought poverty and her train into Eugene's habitation in shapes unknown before, he bore with as much forti∣tude and philosophy as usually falls to the share of five and twenty, that is, with very little if any at all. Some time before this, Cassander who had made two or three voyages for his north-country owners, was invited to London by his brother and his partner, to take the command of one of the large ships in which they were principal proprietors. Overjoyed at this invitation, which would give him an op∣portunity, or rather indeed lay him under the necessity, of being frequently with his brother while on shore, he came to town with all speed,
<PB N="259" REF="030190_0264_0FE5072073094EC0"/>
and was just time enough to be witness to the unfortunate failure of Eugene and his associate in trade.</P>
<P>Thus were the Three Brothers plunged into circumstances of the most helpless distress, just at a time when they entertained hopes (appa∣rently well founded) of fixing themselves to their satisfaction for life in their respective pro∣fessions. Had any one of them been exempt from the pressure of misfortune, the other two would have been sure of partaking with him in the comforts that depend on a competency of wealth. But all three were equally reduced; and the only remnant of happiness, that they could call their own, was the sense of their mu∣tual affection, which still continued unalter∣able, amidst the most pinching trials of disap∣pointment and calamity. In this situation were the Smithsons, when an incident happened which put that affection to the proof, and brought forth instances of self-denial and gene∣rosity that well deserve to be recorded. In the course of Eugene's wanderings as a country player, fortune conducted him to Gravesend where, as he was exhibiting before an audience, chiefly composed of seafaring people, the same fortune unaccountably led his father to become a spectator of his performance. In order to ex∣plain the sudden appearance of Mr. Smithson, it will be necessary to relate what befel him af∣ter his departure from England. The reader will remember that this gentleman had set sail for the West-Indies, in order to take possession of an estate in one of the islands there; but, having pretty early intelligence that the enemy
<PB N="260" REF="030190_0265_0FE5072201315410"/>
were masters of the island, and therefore ap∣prehending numberless obstacles to his obtain∣ing clear and quiet possession of the estate; he formed the immediate resolution of getting out, if possible, to the East Indies, where he trusted that, by his general knowledge of trade, he should in a short time be able to retrieve his shattered circumstances, and to return to his native country with a fortune sufficient to ren∣der the remaining years of his life easy and com∣fortable. At the same time he took another re∣solution (the source of infinite grief and dis∣quiet to his family), which was, never to in∣form them of the place of his retirement until he had gained wealth sufficient to release them from the state of indigence and obscurity into which, he was pursuaded, his absence must have plunged them. This object he amply accom∣plished in ten years, during all which time his family considered him as dead; and at the end of that period he was now returning to share his riches with those whom he held most dear; when the first sight that saluted his eyes after he went on shore was his unfortunate son figuring in the humble profession of a stroller. It is impossible to express the rage, sorrow, and disappoint∣ment, which at once took possession of Mr. Smithson's breast, when he was at length con∣vinced that his eyes and ears did not deceive him. He suddenly left the theatre, or rather barn, before the play was half over, and tak∣ing no farther notice of his son than to leave a note directed for him, and filled with the bit∣terest reproaches, he hurried on board the ship. Upon his arrival in London, finding his anxi∣ous
<PB N="261" REF="030190_0266_0FE507309629A908"/>
wishes and all the projects of his affection disconcerted by his eldest son's imprudence; his next care was to make inquiry about Richard and Cassander; for his wife's death he had been informed of by mere accident a short time be∣fore he left India. Richard he soon found out, who, upon the first summons, flew to embrace his long lost parent. Mr. Smithson, after brief∣ly relating to him the circumstances of his voy∣age to and success in the East Indies, began, bitterly to lament his misfortune in having a son so abandoned to modesty and discretion, as he styled the unfortunate Eugene. He added, that the bulk of the fortune which he had realized abroad, he intended now to divide between his two younger sons, the elder having proved him∣self so unworthy of his favour: that he did not mean to keep them in expectation until his death, but would put each of them in imme∣diate possession of an ample fortune; reserving for himself what he was determined should be sufficient for his necessities during the remain∣der of his life. He concluded with insisting, that whatever he meant thus to dispose in favour of his younger sons, he would take care to see settled in such a manner, that neither Eugene nor his posterity should ever inherit a penny of it.</P>
<P>Richard modestly thanked his father for the affectionate care that he testified for his interest, but tenderly intreated him not to form too pre∣cipitate a resolution to the prejudice of his eldest born. He used many arguments to excuse, or at least to palliate Eugene's indiscretion; repre∣sented the sorrowful effects that a continuance
<PB N="262" REF="030190_0267_0FE5073221AB6280"/>
of his father's resentment might have upon a mind so exquisitely feeling as his; and ended with these words: "As to what regards my own personal advantage, I assure you Sir, I feel myself naturally very indifferent; and were I not so by nature, the profession that I have em∣braced, the precepts of which I have with my whole heart consented to obey, that profession commands me to fix my thoughts and expect∣ations upon matters of a far different nature. Besides, had I the most worldly regard for my own interest, the affection that I have ever borne, and still bear to my brother Eugene, would stand as a bar to my accepting any fortune to which he had the most distant claim. I am not with∣out hopes, my dear father, that when your pre∣sent anger subsides, you will once more look upon him with the tenderness of a parent, in which case you will, I trust, applaud the prin∣ciple that induces me to decline your liberal offer." Mr. Smithson, with astonishment in his countenance, asked his son if he was serious in refusing so handsome a fortune; and finding him fixed in the determination that he had be∣fore expressed, he rose up with evident marks of vexation and disappointment; and casting some uncharitable reflexions on the destiny which, he said, pursued him through life, baffling and frustrating the most favourite and even lauda∣ble wishes of his heart, he added in a tone of voice, somewhat softened, "Little did I expect, when I sent for you, to find you an abettor of that profligacy which has alienated my heart from your elder brother. I fondly thought that my children would pay such deference to my
<PB N="263" REF="030190_0268_0FE50733ABC01A90"/>
authority as even to adopt my prejudices; but since you have determined to think for your∣self, be your own master. Thank Heaven, I have yet one son left." Richard endeavoured in the most respectful manner, to represent the motives of his conduct, but perceiving that whatever he said only tended to irritate his fa∣ther, and that it was impossible, for the pre∣sent, to obtain a calm hearing, he reluctantly withdrew, leaving his father in a situation not to be envied by a parent.</P>
<P>Nothing could arrive more opportunely to relieve the depression of Mr. Smithson's spirits, than the news that he heard next morning; which was, that a ship, in which Cassander had gone out in the capacity of a mate, after the failure of Eugene, was returned from her voy∣age in the river. His resentment was now not only pointed at Eugene for his indiscretion, but at Richard for his too scrupulous, uncomply∣ing principles. He was therefore determined to bestow his whole fortune upon Cassander. But what language can express the amazement of Mr. Smithson, when, upon his proposing to do so, the generous seaman, without the least he∣sitation or preamble, flatly refused to accept a penny of it! He thought, however, that re∣spect to his father required him to give the reasons on which he grounded his refusal. He did so, and with arguments nearly the same as those used by his brother Richard, he endea∣voured to convince his father that passion had a much greater share than mature deliberation in the sentence which he was going to pass upon his eldest son: "We are all liable to go a∣stray,"
<PB N="264" REF="030190_0269_0FE5073534B0A5C0"/>
said Cassander: "happy is he who has the fewest faults. If we do not forgive those of a son, or a brother, Heaven help us when our own come to be judged! As for me, I have lived contented with a little, and am not un∣acquainted with hardship and distress. God for∣bid, therefore, that I should grasp at my bro∣ther's birth-right.—But I declare, were Eugene no brother of mine, knowing as I do his gene∣rons nature and the warmth of his honest heart, I would go before the mast all my life long, sooner than accept, to his prejudice, a property which nature and reason so clearly adjudge to him."</P>
<P>There was something so ingenuous in this address of Cassander's, something that spoke so feelingly to his father's breast, that, in spite of a short conflict which resentment endeavoured to excite there, he found himself constrained to yield the point, and while he wiped away a tear, the offspring of returning tenderness and affection, he took his son by the hand: "Cas∣sander," said he, smiling, "thou hast con∣quered. Surely there must be something of extraordinary merit in Eugene, since he has found two so resolute advocates in his favour as you and your brother Richard.—Well, I for∣give all the past—it shall be buried in oblivi∣on.—Convince me, as I doubt not you will, that my eldest son possesses qualities worthy to excite such sentimnets as you have both express∣ed in his favour, and I shall be happy indeed."</P>
<P>It is needless to add, that the joy produced by this favourable change in Mr. Smithson's feelings was soon diffused in the breasts of his
<PB N="265" REF="030190_0270_0FE5074552B00EC0"/>
two disconsolate sons. Eugene, upon the re∣ceipt of his father's note, had hurried up to town from Gravesend, like one distracted, and was now at Richard's lodgings, indulging the most passionate effusions of grief and despair, while Richard, depressed with a load of sorrows, sat moping in silence, without a word of comfort to offer to his brother. They hardly perceived Cassander enter the room; but when he met their eyes, they started as at the sight of an an∣gel. Something prophetic whispered comfort to their minds even before he spoke. But how

full was the measure of their joy when he an∣nounced to them his father's invitation to repair immediately to his presence! The sequel is ea∣sy to be imagined: all was reconciled: the past was forgotten, and the future opened a prospect of happiness before them more smiling than they had ever enjoyed before.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="030190_0271_0FE507476A0F1700"/>
Thus the Brothers, by the efforts of their mutual affection, increased the happiness that prosperity afforded them, sustained each other under the pressure of misfortune, and, by per∣severing in unalterable friendship to each other, at length ensured both their own happiness and that of their dearest and first friend on earth—their Father.</P>

<HEAD>THE THREE SISTERS.</HEAD>
<P>NOT many years ago there returned from Bengal a man whom we will call John Sterling: he had been well educated, was sprung from a decent family, and brought home the same good heart which he carried out with him from Britain. As his fortune was now very large, and he had formed no matrimonial connexions, his first care, on his arriving in his native land, was to discover what relations he had still re∣maining, and to inquire into their circum∣stances, in order to bestow on the most deserv∣ing of them, part of his great acquisitions. It chanced that the person to whom he applied, was able to assist in his search. "Some at least," said he, "of your family, I can give you a pretty good account of: you have two cou∣sins
<PB N="267" REF="030190_0272_0FE5074A504A74B8"/>
settled in London; they are sisters, and are by no means in distressed circumstances, but are perfect contrasts to each other in their man∣ner of living. The eldest of them is avarici∣ous to an extreme, lives in a paltry lodging, keeps but one maid servant, and in short seems to have no pleasure on earth, except that of heaping up money. Not so her younger sister; she takes care to spend to the very extremity of her income. She takes great delight in dress, equipage, and every species of luxury, but her expences of the showy kind never prevent the exertions of her humanity: there passes no week in which she does not distribute, on an ap∣pointed day, money, cloaths, and victuals to a number of beggars, who crowd around her door to be relieved." "This last cousin of mine," said our Indian, "I like well enough, by your account; but as to the other, not a penny of mine shall she have, to add to her heaps, an old avaricious skin-flint!"</P>
<P>With these sentiments, John Sterling set out to visit his youngest relation. From her he met with a polite and hospitable reception, and de∣parted from her house in a perfect good humour with her and her manner of living.</P>
<P>It happened that the only maid servant who lived with the eldest sister, was acquainted in the family of the person from whom Sterling had received his intelligence concerning the characters of the two sisters. Some of the do∣mestics had overheard the conversation, and took the first opportunity to reproach the girl for the parsimony of her mistress, which they told her had lost her the sharing of a fine sum of
<PB N="268" REF="030190_0273_0FE5074E810CD838"/>
money. This soon reached the ears of the fe∣male miser, whose vexation, at hearing what she had missed, was almost insupportable. The large fortune, which by dint of the most penu∣rious economy she had scraped together, now appeared to her less than nothing, when she considered the immense treasures of her cousin, all of which she thought might have been her own, had she but managed so as to gain the good graces of the owner. "Perhaps," said she to herself, "it may not, even now, be too late to retrieve my error. Some of my money I must sacrifice, it is true, but then if I succeed, I shall be nobly reimbursed. It will go to my heart, indeed, to part with what has been the whole joy of my life to procure, but I see no other chance in my favour, and this scheme must be tried." Having taken her resolution, she determined, as the first step, to contrive to fall into company with her opulent relation. This she soon brought about, by meeting him at her sister's, where he was almost always to be found. She now endeavoured, by every win∣ing grace in her power to captivate his atten∣tion, and when she thought she had in some measure succeeded, she took an opportunity to reproach him for appearing to have forgotten that he had such a relation as herself. "No, Madam," said the blunt Sterling, "I had by no means forgotten you, but the plain truth is, that finding on inquiry, that your turn and mine were as widely different as light and dark∣ness, I thought that no good could arise from any connexion between us." "I comprehend you, Sir," (replied the lady,) you have heard
<PB N="269" REF="030190_0274_0FE50756EA349890"/>
me represented in the most odious colours, as a pattern of meanness and avarice. How cruel is the tongue of defamation! I have laid up mo∣ney, it is true, but Heaven knows with what intent! The service of my indigent fellow-crea∣tures has been my real motive, and it was only to amass a sum sufficient to lay the foundation of a new Hospital, that I have deprived myself of not only the <HI>superfluities,</HI> but almost of the <HI>necessaries</HI> of life. At length I have attained to my wish, and to-morrow I intend to deposit, in the hands of proper trustees, five hundred guineas, which I mean to be laid out in the purchase of land for the edifice to stand upon." The honest Indian was completely taken in by this manoeuvre. "How unjustly," said he to himself, "have I thought of this poor woman! Here has she denied herself every gratification for the sake of the poor, and I have looked on her as a self-interested miser! Well, well, I must contrive to make her amends." Then turning to the lady, "Madam," said he, "hither∣to I have mistaken your character, but I now honour you as much as a few hours past I des∣pised you. But you must not prevent me from sharing with you the merit of the noble work which you have taken in hand; to-morrow I will attend upon you, and will add my part to the do∣nation which you are about to make." He kept his word, and accompanied her the next morn∣ing: he then saw her make a deposit of the sum which she had mentioned, to which he joined a much more considerable present for the same charitable purpose.</P>
<P>The worthy Sterling was recounting the ad∣ventures
<PB N="270" REF="030190_0275_0FE5075A6B2804F8"/>
of the day to his friend, and was tell∣ing him how very unjustly he had thought of the elder of his cousins, when he was told that an old domestic of the family earnestly entreat∣ed to speak with him. "Perhaps," said the good East Indian, "he may need my assistance; let him come in." The poor fellow entered. "Can I, my good friend, be of any service to you?" said Sterling. "I am very unfortunate," said the suppliant, "and it is only the report which I have heard of your goodness, which has tempted me to this application. I lived twenty years in the service of your worthy un∣cle: I married, and when I lost my good mas∣ter, I set up a little shop: when I was going on with tolerable success, I was utterly ruined by an unfortunate fire, which consumed my whole stock. Since that cruel event I have been unable to provide for my young and nu∣merous family, and I now presume to hope that your goodness will enable me to put my poor children into some way of business."</P>
<P>"But why, in the name of wonder, did you not apply to my two cousins!" "Alas, good Sir, I addressed myself to them in the begin∣ing of my misfortunes; but from the eldest I met with a positive refusal; and the other lady, though she offered me some relief, yet she ac∣companied that offer with the condition of my coming publicly along with other poor, to re∣ceive charity at her door; and indeed, Sir, it appeared hard to one who had been a reputable, tradesman, to be reduced to beg his bread at a door in a public street. No Sir, I rather chose
<PB N="271" REF="030190_0276_0FE5075BF6CA5E00"/>
to get into a service, which I fortunately con∣trived to do."</P>
<P>"And what my good friend became then of your children?"</P>
<P>"My eldest daughter, Sir, has had the hap∣piness of being protected by your Honour's cousin, Madam Sophia, who is goodness itself, and who, although in very narrow circumstan∣ces, yet finds opportunities of doing a thousand good actions."</P>
<P>"How?" said the good Sterling, "and have I another cousin? And is she poor, and yet is she charitable? And have I, like a blockhead as I am, been ignorant of her very existence?"</P>
<P>"There is such a one, I assure you, Sir; she is the daughter of your uncle, and young∣est of the three sisters."</P>
<P>"Is this possible?" said the East Indian, "and if so, how comes it about that neither of her sisters have mentioned her name <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>? Where has she lived? How came she so poor?"</P>
<P>"The good lady, Sir, trusted her fortune in the hands of a merchant who became a bank∣rupt, and lost nearly the whole of it. She then retired, with what little she had remaining, to a village in the country, where she boarded at the house of a friend of her's who married a clergyman. There, from her small income, she found means to be of infinite service to her poor neighbours; she visited the sick, she in∣structed the young, and by her example and advice, she reclaimed the idle, and encouraged the worthy members of society. As to her name not being mentioned to you by her sis∣ters, I fear their motive for keeping you in ig∣norance
<PB N="272" REF="030190_0277_0FE5075F77C93C18"/>
concerning her, was their conscious∣ness of her superior claim to your favour and protection."</P>
<P>"This," cried Sterling, "is the exact per∣son that I am looking for. Come, my lad, get your boots ready, to-morrow you shall be my guide to the village where this precious cousin of mine resides; trouble yourself no more about your children; they shall hence forward be <HI>my</HI> care: and as to yourself, quit your service as soon as you can with decency; you are too old to wear a livery, I will provide for you com∣fortably for the rest of your life."</P>
<P>"Oh, Sir," said the old servant, "be assured that what is left of that life shall be employed in praying for blessings on you, and on my kind benefactress Madam Sophia."</P>
<P>Sterling soon reached the village. He alight∣ed at the parsonage, and inquired of the minis∣ter concerning his amiable cousin. "She is an angel," said the priest; "notwithstanding the loss of her fortune, her countenance expresses the happy tranquillity of her mind. Nothing, in short, can deprive her of her benevolence, and that benevolence must always insure her tranquillity." "Tell her, I entreat you, Sir," said Sterling, "that a relation, whom she has never seen, begs to be introduced to her." So∣phia received her cousin with unaffected regard and natural politeness. "I am enchanted with you, my sweet cousin!" said the East Indian. "In your modest, neat, linen gown, you look more like a woman of fashion than your showy sister in her gayest dresses; and poor as you are, your features are illuminated by an air of con∣tent
<PB N="273" REF="030190_0278_0FE50769B0591B10"/>
which never appears on the visage of that other sister of yours; that rich lady that founds hospitals! But tell me now, honestly, cousin Sophy, how has it happened that neither of my cousins ever made mention of your name to me since my arrival? Have you fallen out with them? Or do they not know where you reside?"</P>
<P>"Believe me, Sir," replied Sophia, "I love them both too well to keep them in ignorance of my place of abode, and within these last three days I have written to each of them." "Hard-hearted wretches!" exclaimed the good Sterling; "can I ever forget their indifference to so amiable a relation?" "Excuse them this one time," said the gentle Sophia; "I doubt not but that they meant to have made me amends for this omission, by the future kind∣ness of their behaviour." "No, no," said her cousin, "I know the vileness of their hearts. They were conscious of your superior merit, and dreaded, lest I should reward it by bestow∣ing on you that fortune which each of them al∣ready grasped as her own: but their odious cunning and greediness shall be disappointed. To your ostentatious sister I will not give one farthing; she does good, indeed, but it is merely for the sake of being talked of abroad as a woman of unbounded charity. Your pe∣nurious sister I am still less disposed to encou∣rage. The donation which she has made in fa∣vour of the poor, has her own interest so im∣mediately in view, that it gives me infinitely more <HI>disgust</HI> than <HI>pleasure. You,</HI> my worthy cousin, who do good actions merely because it is right and fitting to do them, <HI>you</HI> I declare
<PB N="274" REF="030190_0279_0FE5081964C836C8"/>
to be my sole inheritrix; and from this mo∣ment I insist on your making use of my fortune as if it were your own. I know that fortune is by no means necessary to your happiness; but I know, at the same time, that <HI>your</HI> being rich will be the means of communicating happiness to numbers of sufferers, whom, until now, you could only pity and not relieve."</P>

<HEAD>THE CONTRAST.</HEAD>
<P>FREDERIC was the son of a lady of fortune, who, having retired to her estate in the coun∣try, bestowed most of her time on his educa∣tion. In return for her attachment to him, Frederic was modest, studious, and humane; he felt the obligations which he was under to his parent, and did his best to requite them by pursuing her instructions with care, and by preferring her company to that of any other person. Jacob, a lad of the same age with Fre∣deric, and whose mother's cottage stood near the park-pale of the lady we have just spoken of, was in every respect of a character directly opposite to that of his amiable neighbour. He
<PB N="275" REF="030190_0280_0FE5081AF1907A00"/>
was loved by no one, not even by his poor mo∣ther, all whose endeavours could never prevail on him even to take the pains of learning to read. The most innocent way in which he spent his time was in loitering from place to place, and lounging about; at other seasons he was the plague of his comrades, and, in consequence, the detestation of the village. Frederic was too well bred up to choose so vile a boy for a play-fellow; Jacob, however, taking advan∣tage of the opportunities which the situation of his mother's tenement gave him, stole, one day, into the room where Frederic's playthings were kept, broke to pieces his violin and his chariot, completely spoilt his bird organ, and carried off in triumph his hobby horse.</P>
<P>The author of this mischief was soon dis∣covered, and Frederic, in the first emotions of resentment, was running, by the advice of a ser∣vant, to acquaint the mother of Jacob with the exploits of her son. "But, no," said he checking his speed, "she is a severe woman, and she will horsewhip him without mercy, and, may be, shut him up in an out-house for a week together. How should I like that for myself? No, no, I had better forgive him, for this once."</P>
<P>Not long after this, Frederic was walking out with his beloved mother, when unluckily they strolled near a place where the thoughtless, wicked Jacob was amusing himself by throwing stones with all his little force at every object within his reach, totally regardless of the mis∣chief which he might occasion. One of these unluckily hit the little Frederic on the head,
<PB N="276" REF="030190_0281_0FE5081EEDD36E18"/>
and fetched the blood; but Frederic was too much of a man to cry at a little pain.—"Ma∣ma," said the spirited lad, "this stone has hurt me a little, but I dare say the pain will soon be over." As his forehead, however, was all covered with blood, his mother went directly home with him and had every proper care taken of his wound. It was an ugly one, and brought on a fever, and it was the end of seven or eight days before he was permitted to walk out, and his mother being engaged with company, ordered a servant to accompany him. As they were walking, the discourse turned on the wickedness of Jacob: and just as the do∣mestic was hopeing that they might see nothing of him during their walk, they heard a rustling noise in a tree behind them, and down, at once, came Jacob, screaming and crying, from the top of an elm, which his usual spirit of mischief had tempted him to climb in pursuit of a crow's nest. "I fear," said Frederic, exerting his ut∣most endeavours to raise the poor wretch, "that you have hurt yourself sadly." Jacob still con∣tinued his groans and cries; and well he might, for, upon examination, his leg appeared to be, broken in two places, "Poor fellow," said the benevolent Frederic, "how he must suffer! let us contrive some how or other, to convey him home to his mother.—Unhappy woman! what distress must she not feel when she sees the condition of her unlucky son!" Her distress was great indeed. "Poor as I am," she ex∣claimed, "I can just support myself and this ungracious lad; but how shall I ever be able to pay the long demand which the surgeon will
<PB N="277" REF="030190_0282_0FE5082AB4ED9368"/>
have upon me, by the time that Jacob reco∣vers." Little Frederic, who was a witness to her complaints, afforded to them those tears which his own suffering could never extort from him.—"Make yourself easy, my good neigh∣bour," said the amiable boy, "and oblige me so far as to accept this new crown-piece, which my good Mama has just given me that I might buy me a fairing, but I can do without it bet∣ter than <HI>you</HI> can." The afflicted mother looked at him with silent admiration. Frederic pro∣ceeded to assure her, that he was conscious of the smallness of the sum, (though it was his all) he would use his interest with his parent for a larger supply, and did not doubt to obtain it. The unfortunate woman now found her tongue, and expressed in the most affecting terms, her astonishment at seeing his earnestness in reliev∣ing that worthless lad, by whose mischievous hand his forehead was <HI>still</HI> smarting. "This," said she, "is <HI>truly</HI> to return good for evil!" Frederic now returned to his mother, and after giving her the history of the whole occurrence, "How comes it, Mama," said he, "that al∣though I was truly sorry for poor Jacob's mis∣fortune, and though I feel both for him and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mother, yet, on the whole, I am more <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> than <HI>grieved?</HI>" "Child," said the lady, "you have had an opportunity of doing well, and you have made use of it; and, believe me, throughout life you will find, that the con∣sciousness of having done a benevolent action will be the most effectual cordial for every painful sensation."</P>

<HEAD>THE DIVERTING HISTORY OF JOHN GILPIN; SHOWING How he went Farther than he intended, and came safe Home again.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>JOHN GILPIN was a citizen</L>
<L>Of credit and renown;</L>
<L>A train-band captain eke was he</L>
<L>Of famous London town.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>John Gilpin's spouse said to her dear—</L>
<L>"Though wedded we have been</L>
<L>"These twice ten tedious years, yet we</L>
<L>"No holiday have seen.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="280" REF="030190_0285_0FE5082EF2CCF1A0"/>
<L>"To-morrow is our wedding day,</L>
<L>"And we will then repair,</L>
<L>"Unto the Bell at Edmonton,</L>
<L>"All in a chaise and pair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"My sister and my sister's child,</L>
<L>"Myself and children three,</L>
<L>"Will fill the chaise; so you must ride</L>
<L>"On horseback after we."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He soon replied—"I do admire</L>
<L>"Of womankind but one,</L>
<L>"And you are she, my dearest dear,</L>
<L>"Therefore it shall be done.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"I am a linen-draper bold,</L>
<L>"As all the world doth know,</L>
<L>"And my good friend the callender</L>
<L>"Will lend his horse to go."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Quoth Mrs. Gilpin—"That's well said;</L>
<L>"And, for that wine is dear,</L>
<L>"We will be furnish'd with our own,</L>
<L>"Which is both bright and clear."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>John Gilpin kiss'd his loving wife;</L>
<L>O'erjoy'd was he to find,</L>
<L>That, though on pleasure she was bent,</L>
<L>She had a frugal mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The morning came, the chaise was brought,</L>
<L>But yet was not allow'd</L>
<L>To drive up to the door, lest all</L>
<L>Should say that she was proud.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="281" REF="030190_0286_0FE5083089363B08"/>
<L>So three doors off the chaise was staid,</L>
<L>Where they did all get in,</L>
<L>Six precious souls, and all agog</L>
<L>To dash through thick and thin.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Smack went the whip, round went the wheels,</L>
<L>Were never folks so glad;</L>
<L>The stones did rattle underneath,</L>
<L>As if Cheapside were mad.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>John Gilpin, at his horse's side,</L>
<L>Seiz'd fast the flowing mane,</L>
<L>And up he got, in haste to ride,</L>
<L>But soon came down again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For saddle-tree scarce reach'd had he,</L>
<L>His journey to begin,</L>
<L>When, turning round his head, he saw</L>
<L>Three customers come in.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So down he came; for loss of time,</L>
<L>Although it griev'd him sore,</L>
<L>Yet loss of pence, full well he knew,</L>
<L>Would trouble him much more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas long before the customers</L>
<L>Were fated to their mind,</L>
<L>When Betty, sceaming, came down stairs,</L>
<L>"The wine is left behind!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Good lack!" quoth he—"yet bring it me,</L>
<L>"My leathern belt likewise,</L>
<L>In which I dear my trusty sword</L>
<L>'When I do exercise."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="282" REF="030190_0287_0FE5083F2E857068"/>
<L>Now Mrs. Gilpin—careful soul—</L>
<L>Had two stone bottles found,</L>
<L>To hold the liquor that she lov'd,</L>
<L>And keep it safe and sound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Each bottle had a curling ear,</L>
<L>Through which the belt he drew,</L>
<L>And hung a bottle on each side,</L>
<L>To make his balance true.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then over all, that he might be</L>
<L>Equipp'd from top to toe,</L>
<L>His long red cloak, well brush'd and neat,</L>
<L>He manfully did throw.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now see him mounted once again</L>
<L>Upon his nimble steed,</L>
<L>Full slowly pacing o'er the stones,</L>
<L>With caution and good heed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But finding soon a smoother road</L>
<L>Beneath his well-shod feet,</L>
<L>The snorting beast began to trot,</L>
<L>Which gall'd him in his seat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So, "Fair and softly," John he cried,</L>
<L>But John he cried in vain;</L>
<L>That trot became a gallop soon,</L>
<L>In spite of curb and rein.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So stooping down, as needs he must</L>
<L>Who cannot sit upright,</L>
<L>He grasp'd the mane with both his hands,</L>
<L>And eke with all his might.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="283" REF="030190_0288_0FE50841D63BF0B8"/>
<L>His horse, who never in that sort</L>
<L>Had handled been before,</L>
<L>What thing upon his back had got</L>
<L>Did wonder more and more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Away went Gilpin, neck or nought,</L>
<L>Away went hat and wig;</L>
<L>He little dreamt when he set out,</L>
<L>Of running such a rig.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The wind did blow, the cloak did fly,</L>
<L>Like streamer long and gay,</L>
<L>Till loop and button failing both,</L>
<L>At last it flew away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then might all people well discern</L>
<L>The bottles he had slung;</L>
<L>A bottle swinging at each side,</L>
<L>As hath been said or sung.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The dogs did bark, the children scream'd,</L>
<L>Up flew the windows all;</L>
<L>And ev'ry soul cried out, "Well done!"</L>
<L>As loud as he could bawl.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Away went Gilpin—who but he!</L>
<L>His fame soon spread around—</L>
<L>"He carries weight!—he rides a race!—</L>
<L>"'Tis for a thousand pound!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And still, as fast as he drew near,</L>
<L>'Twas wonderful to view,</L>
<L>How, in a trice, the turnpike-men</L>
<L>Their gates wide open threw.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="284" REF="030190_0289_0FE50844103D1AC0"/>
<L>And now as he went bowing down</L>
<L>His reeking head full low,</L>
<L>The bottles twain behind his back,</L>
<L>Were shattered at a blow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Down ran the wine into the road</L>
<L>Most piteous to be seen,</L>
<L>Which made his horse's flanks to smoke</L>
<L>As they had basted been.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But still he seem'd to carry weight,</L>
<L>With leather girdle <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</L>
<L>For all might see the bottle-necks</L>
<L>Still dangling at his waist.</L>

<LG>
<L>Thus all through merry Islington,</L>
<L>These gambol <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> did play,</L>
<L>And till he came unto the Wash</L>
<L>Of Edmonton so gay</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And there he drew the Wash about</L>
<L>On both sides of the way,</L>
<L>Just like unto a trundling-<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</L>
<L>Or a wild goose at play.</L>

<LG>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Edmonton his loving wife</L>
<L>From the balcony spied,</L>
<L>Her tender husband, wond'ring much</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Stop, stop, John Gilpin! here's the house!"</L>
<L>They all at once did cry;</L>
<L>"The dinner waits, and we are tir'd!—well</L>
<L>Said Gilpin—"So am I."</L>

<L>But yet his horse was not a whit</L>
<L>Inclin'd to tarry there;</L>
<L>For why?—his owner had a house</L>
<L>Full ten miles off, at Ware.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So like an arrow swift he flew,</L>
<L>Shot by an archer strong;</L>
<L>So did he fly—which brings me to</L>
<L>The middle of my song.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Away went Gilpin out of breath,</L>
<L>And sore against his will,</L>
<L>Till at his friend the callender's</L>
<L>His horse at last stood still.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The callender, amaz'd to see</L>
<L>His neighbour in such trim,</L>
<L>Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate</L>
<L>And thus accosted him—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"What news! what news! your tidings tell,</L>
<L>"Tell me you must and shall—</L>
<L>"Say, why bare-headed you are come,</L>
<L>"Or why you come at all?"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now Gilpin had a pleasant wit,</L>
<L>And lov'd a timely joke;</L>
<L>And thus unto the callender</L>
<L>In merry guise he spoke—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"I came because your horse would come;</L>
<L>"And, if I well forebode,</L>
<L>"My hat and wig will soon be here;</L>
<L>"They are upon the road."</L>

<L>The callender, right glad to find</L>
<L>His friend in merry pin,</L>
<L>Return'd him not a single word,</L>
<L>But to the house went in:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whence straight he came with hat and wig,</L>
<L>A wig that flow'd behind,</L>
<L>A hat not much the worse for wear,</L>
<L>Each comely in its kind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He held them up, and, in his turn,</L>
<L>Thus show'd his ready wit—</L>
<L>"My head is twice as big as yours,</L>
<L>"They, therefore, needs must fit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"But let me scrape the dirt away</L>
<L>"That hangs upon your face;</L>
<L>"And stop and eat—for well you may</L>
<L>"Be in a hungry case!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Said John—"It is my wedding day,</L>
<L>"And all the world would stare,</L>
<L>"If wife should dine at Edmonton,</L>
<L>"And I should dine at Ware."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So turning to his horse, he said,</L>
<L>"I am in haste to dine;</L>
<L>"'Twas for your pleasure you came here—</L>
<L>"You shall go back for mine."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah! luckless speech and bootless boast,</L>
<L>For which he paid full dear;</L>
<L>For, while he spake, a braying ass</L>
<L>Did sing most loud and clear:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="287" REF="030190_0292_0FE5085BD2CCCA38"/>
<L>Whereat his horse did snort, as he</L>
<L>Had heard a lion roar,</L>
<L>And gallopp'd off with all his might,</L>
<L>As he had done before.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Away went Gilpin—and away</L>
<L>Went Gilpin's hat and wig;</L>
<L>He lost them sooner than at first,</L>
<L>For why?—they were too big.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now Mistress Gilpin, when she saw</L>
<L>Her husband posting down</L>
<L>Into the country far away,</L>
<L>She pull'd out half-a-crown;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And thus unto the youth she said</L>
<L>That drove them to the Bell,</L>
<L>"This shall be yours, when you bring back</L>
<L>"My husband safe and well."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The youth did ride, and soon did meet</L>

<HEAD>FATAL EFFECTS OF DELAY.</HEAD>
<P>CHARLES STANLEY was the second son of a gentleman, who possessed a small estate in Yorkshire, (Old England) which at his death was designed for his eldest son, and the young∣est was to be brought up to some genteel busi∣ness, by which he might improve the little for∣tune which his father intended for him. Charles gave early marks of a sweet and engaging tem∣per; he was dutiful to his parents, he tenderly loved his brother, and was so obliging to the servants, that he became the favourite with them all. Every little boy in the village talk∣ed of the good nature of little Charles, and of his willingness to part with his sweetmeats and playthings.</P>
<P>When Charles was about four years old, his father sent him to a neighbouring school, where he was very soon as much remarked for the progress he made in learning as he had been for his sweet temper. He read better than any boy in the school, and whenever he went be∣fore
<PB N="290" REF="030190_0295_0FE50869C6FF6D78"/>
his master to spell, he was certain to get the first place. This great quickness gave much delight to his fond parents and his tutor, though they observed that with all his good qualities, Charles had one capital fault; instead of going directly to school he would often loiter in the fields till long after the other boys had gone in, and his books were always to be sought for at the very time when he should have taken them to his master.</P>
<P>At a proper age, Charles was placed by his father at a great school, where he no longer found the indulgence to his faults, which he had met with from the village tutor. He was not allowed to defer the morning's task till the afternoon, and it was remarked to him that he was inferior in learning to many who were his juniors in age. Charles was stung with the re∣mark; he knew that he was able to excel, and he resolved that he would at some time take great pains, and obtain the same rank he had held in the village school; but he thought he might defer this till some future time. His work, while he was under the eye of his master, was performed as well, and in less time than that of most of his school-fellows; but the tasks which he had to perform out of school hours were always deferred, and everything furnished Charles with an excuse for delay; not that he passed his vacant time in play; instead of that he was often employed in writing exercises for his school-fellows while they were amusing themselves, and his own task was deferred till the morning, when there was little time to per∣form it well, and he was punished for the faults.
<PB N="291" REF="030190_0296_0FE5086BA32709E8"/>
Thus poor Charles seldom enjoyed the proper season for play. He was compelled to com∣plete his task, when his companions were en∣joying themselves in innocent sports, and he was seldom set free from work till they were retiring to rest.</P>
<P>Charles continued in this situation till the age of fourteen, and was every day remarked for his abilities to excel, and for those habits of de∣lay which often destroyed all the advantages he naturally possessed. Mr. Stanley then took him to London, and placed him with a Mer∣chant, a friend of his, in the city, to whom he hoped Charles would become so agreeable, as in time to be admitted into partnership with him. In this situation Charles gave the strong∣est proofs of integrity, sweet temper, and great abilities, but delay attended whatever he under∣took; he was not dressed till some hours after he should be at the desk; he did not get to the Custom-House till the books were shut, nor appear upon Change, till every man of bu∣siness had deserted it. With more virtues, and greater ability, than almost any man of his ac∣quaintance, he became a general object of ridicule and derision, and when the term of his apprenticeship expired, he found that, with a character which was shaded with only one foible, all intimate connexions with him were shunned by the sober part of the trading world.</P>
<P>About this time Charles had the misfortune to lose his father, who bequeathed him such a fortune as entitled him to expect a partnership in some respectable house. But his known ha∣bit of delay prevented his friends from making
<PB N="292" REF="030190_0297_0FE5086D37DEFA80"/>
the offer; and though he fully intended to seek such a connexion, yet he continued to defer it till he had greatly lessened his little patrimony. His father had introduced him to several friends who might have assisted him greatly, but he had disgusted them by his conduct, by deferring his visits to unseasonable hours, and by protracting them till the repeated yawns of the family informed him that it was time to de∣part. Charles, who saw himself in a situation where he was very likely to be without either friends or fortune, now resolved to exert him∣self, and to follow the plan which his father had traced out for his conduct in life. He could not, indeed, meet with an agreeable partnership, but he determined to enter into a mercantile line by himself; and his friends, who were delighted with his exertions, formed such extensive connexions for him, that he had the greatest chance of being in a few years one of the richest men in the city. But alas! his habit of delay had acquired more strength than he was aware of, and his efforts to conquer it were but transient. Charles soon relapsed into his former indolence. He deferred business till he had not time to transact it. He neglect∣ed to comply with the orders of his correspond∣ents till the goods they sent for were no longer wanted; and he omitted insuring his vessels, not because he intended to risk the loss, but because, as he did not see them sinking he thought he might defer the business to some future <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. In a short time his business de∣clined, several of his vessels had either been ta∣ken or lost, his creditors poured in from every
<PB N="293" REF="030190_0298_0FE50870A0CF2798"/>
quarter, his property could not answer their demands; and Charles Stanley, whose integrity was respected by all, was hurried to prison, with the conviction that his misfortunes were the consequence of his folly.</P>
<P>In this wretched situation Charles was a prey to sorrow. His heart was melted at the misery which many poor and innocent families must have suffered from his failure; and he thought of the uneasiness he must have given to his mo∣ther with agony. Firmly did he resolve, that if he could ever again be established, he would atone by his future diligence for his past mis∣conduct; but where could he look for assist∣ance? His mother had no more than was suffi∣cient for her support; and his brother had al∣ready given him whatever he could afford. Charles was sitting alone, reflecting upon the sad situation of his affairs, when he was inform∣ed that a gentleman inquired for him below, and in a few moments he beheld a brother of his mother's, whom the family had believed to be dead, but who was just returned from India with a large fortune. Mr. Hilton was much grieved at the misconduct and misfortunes of his nephew; but was so much affected by his in∣genuous account of his past faults, and his reso∣lutions of amendment, that he generously dis∣charged all his debts, and enabled him to ap∣pear again amongst his old acquaintance with credit.</P>
<P>Charles, fully sensible of the miseries from which he had been delivered, was very earnest to settle himself in some business which would afford him support; and his kind uncle, who
<PB N="294" REF="030190_0299_0FE5088013EBAF88"/>
hoped that a new scene would be favourable to his new-formed plans, earnestly advised him to embark for India, promising to return with him that he might see him well settled. This good∣ness filled the heart of Charles with the warmest gratitude; he fell at his feet, and declared with tears, that he would exert himself to the utmost to fulfil the commands of his generous bene∣factor. Every thing was ordered for their de∣parture, and when the time arrived for the sail∣ing of the ship, Mr. Hilton went on board with some goods which were in readiness, leaving his nephew to follow him to the Downs with those which were not quite finished. But de∣lay again appeared in the conduct of Charles; he omitted inquiring after them till an express arrived from Mr. Hilton, with the account that the vessel was to sail the next day, and that he must hasten down immediately. Charles then began to execute the orders which his uncle had left, but was detained so long before he could get the goods, that when he reached the Downs he found the ship had sailed some hours. Almost distracted with this account, and with the thoughts of what his kind uncle must think of his misconduct, he wandered about for some time in the greatest distress, and at length having become almost desperate, he hired a quick-sailing boat, in hopes of being able to overtake the ship. For some time they ad∣vanced rapidly, and gained sight of the India ship, and the heart of Charles was alternately agitated by hope and fear. But suddenly the sky was overcast, the sea swelled, the wind roared, and the boatmen declared that there
<PB N="295" REF="030190_0300_0FE5088D169455A0"/>
was every appearance of an approaching storm, which soon raged round them with the utmost fury. The vessel, which was too light to re∣sist its force, was tossed about at the mercy of the wind and waves, and the only hope the un∣happy Charles had of saving his own life, and those of his companions, was by reaching the ship which they saw at a small distance before them. But they exerted every effort in vain; a great sea broke over the bark, and Mr. Hil∣ton had the misery of seeing it sink for ever into the bosom of the ocean, and to lament the loss of the unfortunate Charles, who, though possessed of such talents as made him loved and admired by all, yet by one unhappy foible was rendered miserable and ridiculous through life, and subjected to a dreadful and premature death.</P>

<HEAD>THE NOSEGAY.</HEAD>
<P>CAPTAIN DORMER, and his amiable La∣dy, had lived during several years at their seat in Dorsetshire, happy in themselves, and beloved by all around them, when they re∣ceived the unwelcome account that the Captain was commanded to join his regiment, which
<PB N="296" REF="030190_0301_0FE5088EA1AE0A30"/>
was ordered to embark for America. The news of this event filled all the country with sorrow. The rich grieved for the loss of so excellent a neighbour; the poor mourned for the departure of their kind and constant bene∣factor; and the tenants and servants wept aloud at the thoughts of being separated from a mas∣ter who had always treated them more like children than dependants. But in vain were their intreaties that he would remain; honour called upon him to depart, and Mrs. Dormer saw, with the utmost sorrow, that to honour he would sacrifice the strongest feelings of his breast. She resolved, however, not to be left behind, and in a short time they exchanged the tranquil pleasures of Belmount, for the horrors of carnage and war.</P>
<P>Mrs. Dormer had not been long in America before she lay-in of twins, both daughters, and very beautiful. In the care of these sweet children she found some relief during the fre∣quent absences of her husband, and would oft∣en indulge the hope of returning peace, when the Captain, instead of engaging in the slaugh∣ter of his fellow-creatures, might enjoy the delight of improving his little Fanny and So∣phia. The children daily became more fond of their parents, often clinging to their father when they saw him preparing to go out, and always clapping their little hands with joy when they saw him return. As soon as they were able to speak, Mrs. Dormer taught them to say Papa, and in a short time, when they saw him at a distance, they would directly leave their play, and running up to Mama, would
<PB N="297" REF="030190_0302_0FE508902FC3F760"/>
cry out, <Q>Papa is come, dear papa is come to see his little girls.</Q></P>
<P>The improvement of the children became more visible every day, and they were daily more dear to their parents, when Captain Dor∣mer, returning from a foraging party, was fiercely and suddenly attacked by the Indians, and a desperate engagement ensued. The time when Mrs. Dormer had expected his return had long passed, and she sat in silent agony look∣ing at her dear children, whom at one moment she feared were deprived of their parent, and the next, stepping to the room door, she anxi∣ously listened to every noise, and was fearful, lest even the sound of her own breath should prevent her from hearing the well-known step of her beloved husband. At length a sound reached her ears—it came nearer; it increased, and she flew down stairs in the fond hope of welcoming the return of what was most dear to her. The door was opened, but it no longer opened to admit the tender husband and fond father joyfully returning from the labours of the day; Captain Dormer was brought in a mangled lifeless corpse.</P>
<P>Thus cruelly deprived of her husband, Mrs. Dormer resolved to return to England, and to employ her time in the education of her little girls. She took them down into Dorsetshire, and instructed them herself; and little Fanny and Sophia Dormer were soon remarked as the neatest work-women in the country. But their good Mama did not direct their attention merely to the little arts of making trifling or∣naments: she taught them that virtue was su∣perior
<PB N="298" REF="030190_0303_0FE50893B42E3B08"/>
to accomplishments, and that what was useful was more excellent than what was merely elegant. Little Fanny soon understood, that though music gave her great delight, it was still more delightful by her own sweetness to charm all around her; and Sophia learned that no pleasure was equal to the pleasure of doing good to her fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>In this happy retirement Mrs. Dormer con∣tinued for some years improving her sweet girls in real virtue and useful knowledge. At this time Lady Aubrey, a relation of Mrs. Dormer's paid her a visit, and upon her re∣turn would gladly have prevailed with the good mother to suffer both her daughters to spend some time with her in London. This, how∣ever, Mrs. Dormer could not agree to; but as Fanny had shown a strong affection for her La∣dyship, and earnestly wished to see London, she consented to her going; and Sophia, who preferred the company of her Mama to any other enjoyment, was left at home. At first indeed, she felt uneasy without her sister; she found a solo on the harpsichord was not half so agreeable as a duet, and the beautiful alcove in the garden was not near so pleasant, as when Fanny sat with her there, at her drawing or needle-work. By degrees, however, she be∣came reconciled to her loss, but frequently thought that Fanny could not enjoy half the pleasure in London that she did at Belmount, in assisting her Mama to work for the poor people of the village, or in going with her to visit those who were sick. But her greatest de∣light was in the office which Mrs. Dormer had
<PB N="299" REF="030190_0304_0FE5089DC46588B8"/>
given her of distributing the broken victuals, which were given away to the poor every day at her gate. This was the highest pleasure Sophia could receive. She slew with rapture to the house keeper to obtain her welcome burden, under which she tottered to the door. She exulted in seeing so many poor creatures made happy by her bounty, and delighted to hear them say, <Q>Here comes the good little girl; she will, one day, be as good a lady as her Mama;</Q> and she often thought with great pleasure of the joy which her sister Fanny would have, when she returned, in this new employment.</P>
<P>But Fanny's visit to Lady Aubrey unfitted her for the innocent pleasures of Belmount. She never heard of such a thing as working for the poor from her Ladyship; and cards, dress, and elegant equipages, engaged the attention of all the circles to which Fanny was admitted. She almost learned to forget the poor; and when she returned to Belmount, she spoke haughtily to the servants, and scarcely noticed her inferiors; and when the poor came to re∣ceive their daily allowance, instead of serving them, she either turned away, or suffered her little favourite dog, Surly, to bark at them, and shake their tattered cloaths. All the village talked of her pride, and lamented that the good Mrs. Dormer should have such a naughty little girl; but the good and gentle Sophia was loved by them all. They presented her with the choicest flowers in their gardens, and the most beautiful bantams and pea-fowls were sent to the poultry-yard of the good little girl that be∣haved
<PB N="300" REF="030190_0305_0FE5089F50E59B78"/>
so well to every one. When Mrs. Dor∣mer came from church, all the farmers and their wives made their best bows and curtsies to the good lady, who spoke kindly to them all. She was followed by Fanny, who never turned her head aside; but when Sophia came near, the children plucked one another, and said, <Q>Here comes the good young lady, see how good humoured she looks: she will ask us all how we do.</Q></P>
<P>Fanny could not avoid seeing how disagree∣able her pride made her to every body, and she found herself much less happy than she was be∣fore she went to London; but she had learned there to think that such behaviour was right, and, if it was an error, she foolishly resolved ra∣ther to adhere to it than to own she had been wrong. She was one day invited with her sister to a ball at the house of a lady in the neighbour∣hood, where she was to meet all the young peo∣ple in that country. Her heart exulted in the thoughts of this gay party, and she resolved to behave in the same manner she had seen some fashionable ladies do in London. Upon enter∣ing the room she advanced to a small knot of young ladies of her acquaintance; and, without speaking to the rest of the company, began to make remarks upon their dress and manners in a whispering voice, but in a tone loud enough to be heard. After some time a young lady, whom she had never seen before, entered the room, in a dress made up in a manner very dif∣ferent from any that Fanny had ever observed; she directly began to sneer at her, and declared, that for her part she was surprised such strange
<PB N="302" REF="030190_0306_0FE508A0DC0080B8"/>
figures should think of mixing with people of fashion, and wondered where they came from. The young lady, confounded at so rude a re∣ception, retired to a corner, where she was joined by the good humoured Sophia, who chatted with her till the lady of the house re∣turned into the room, and introduced her into the company as the eldest daughter of the Duke of Dorset, who was just returned from a tour to France. Nothing could exceed the chagrin of Fanny, when she found that the young lady whom she had been ridiculing was the principal person in the company, and that the dress she had despised, was the admiration of all who saw it. She had not the assurance to endea∣vour to repair her fault by apologies, or to press her acquaintance upon the lady whom she had so grossly affronted. Indeed she saw that nei∣ther her excuses nor intimacy would be accept∣ed, and she had the mortification of hearing her sister Sophia receive a very pressing invi∣tation to Dorset House, in which she was not included.</P>
<P>Fanny was greatly mortified at this incident, and she resolved never to behave in such a man∣ner again. She ought, indeed, directly to have endeavoured to conquer every feeling of pride, and to return to that behaviour which made her beloved by every body; but she only resolved that she would not again laugh aloud at a stranger in a genteel company, and run the risk of offending her superiors. As to the poor and miserable, she thought them beneath her regard.</P>
<P>Some time after this, Fanny and Sophia were
<PB N="302" REF="030190_0307_0FE508A4478FE1F0"/>
again invited to the house of a lady, whom, as Fanny regarded her as a person of great taste, she was desirous to please her by appearance. She put on all her little finery, but found that one thing was necessary to complete her dress, which was a Nosegay, and this she was deter∣mined to buy when they reached the town. They set off in the carriage, attended only by servants, and by Fanny's little dog, which ran at the side of the chariot. Fanny could talk of nothing but of calling at the florist's, and of the elegant Nosegay with which she should be adorned. At length they saw a little tattered girl laying asleep upon the side of the road, whom Surley directly attacked, and began to shake her ragged cloaths. Sophia called him hastily away, and would have succeeded before he had awakened the poor little girl, but Fanny encouraged him to proceed; upon this the child starting up, aimed a blow at the dog, which he avoided, and made a snap at her leg. The poor terrified girl then endeavoured to run away, but in running missed her step, and fell down the bank into the ditch. She had hurt her foot, and lay crying in the ditch till Sophia ordered the servant to take her up, and, contrary to the advice of Fanny, desired him to place her in the chariot that they might convey her home. She then began to comfort the poor child, and inquired about her hurt; but she continued to cry out, "O my poor mammy, my poor mam∣my, what will she do, now I cannot run a∣bout and beg for her and my daddy!" "Who is your mammy," said Sophia, "and what shall we do for your foot?" "Oh! don't mind my
<PB N="303" REF="030190_0308_0FE508ADE11B6EF0"/>
foot," said the child, "give me only some bread for my poor mammy and daddy, and my little brother, and I don't care what becomes of my foot."</P>
<P>The child had scarcely finished her speech when the carriage stopped at the door of a cot∣tage, which the little girl said was her home. When she attempted to get out, she found her∣self unable to walk, and was obliged to be car∣ried by the footman, who, accompanied by So∣phia, entered the house, while Fanny remained in the carriage sullenly pouting at her sister's condescension, and very angry to be so delayed. She was indeed sorry to see the poor child so hurt, and when she was taken out of the car∣riage gave her what money she could spare; but she took care to keep enough to buy her elegant Nosegay. When Sophia entered the house, she found a scene of misery which she could not have conceived. The father of the little girl had long laboured under an ague and fever, her mother was worn down with poverty and fatigue, and her little brother crying for hunger in a corner of a poor cottage, strip∣ed of almost of all its furniture, which had been sold to buy necessaries. Sophia found that little Sally had gone out in the morning to beg something for this afflicted family, and that, quite exhausted with hunger and fatigue, she set down upon the bank and cried herself to sleep. The tender heart of Sophia was greatly affected by this distress; she empitied her pocket of every farthing which it contained, and gave it to the good woman of the house, and would not keep enough to buy the collar which she
<PB N="304" REF="030190_0309_0FE508B173F15918"/>
had once intended for her little favourite squir∣rel. She then prepared to leave the cottage, but before she went, desired the poor people to get what was necessary, and told them she would soon return with her good Mama, who would give them cloaths and victuals enough.</P>
<P>The sisters then proceeded to their visit. Fanny bought her Nosegay, which was very beautiful: but the sweetness of Sophia, and the cheerfulness which the thoughts of the good action she had been performing inspired her with, made her so agreeable, that all the com∣pany were charmed with her, but paid little attention to Fanny. At night, when they re∣turned, Mrs. Dormer noticed Fanny's Nose∣gay, which, though it had begun to fade, was still very beautiful. This pleased Fanny, and she cried out, "Ah! Mama, I was sure you would like it, it is so very pretty, and my sister liked it very much indeed." "Then why did she not buy one?" said Mrs. Dormer; Fanny hung down her head, and in a faultering tone answered, "Because she had no money." Mrs. Dormer, surprised at this, for she had given some to each of them that very morning, in∣quired from Sophia what was become of it; Sophia then recounted to her mother the con∣dition in which she had seen the poor people at the cottage, but took care not to mention a word of Fanny's ill behaviour: she then told her the way in which she had disposed of her money, and the promise she had made of tak∣ing her Mama to the cottage; and ended by begging that she would go with he▪ in the morning. Transported with her conduct, Mrs.
<PB N="305" REF="030190_0310_0FE508B303C4EF70"/>
Dormer pressed her virtuous child to her bosom, and promised to take care of the wretched fa∣mily, for whom Sophia was so much interested. Then looking with anger at Fanny, she said, "Did you then give nothing to these poor unhappy creatures?" Fanny hung down her head in silence, for she was ashamed to speak; but Sophia said, "Oh yes, Mama, indeed she gave them all the money she had; except just enough to buy her Nosegay and a trinket for her little watch; and I am sure if she had gone into the cottage and seen their misery, she would have given them that too." "She sat at the door then," said Mrs. Dormer, "while you went in." Then turning to Fanny, "Proud and unfeeling girl," said she, "who could pre∣fer vain and trifling ornaments to the delight of relieving the sick and miserable! Retire from my presence; take with you your trinket and Nosegay, and receive from them all the com∣forts which they are able to bestow."</P>
<P>Sophia would gladly have retired with her sister; she was grieved at the displeasure she had incurred from her Mama, and she wished earnestly to sooth and comfort the dejected Fanny. Mrs. Dormer, however, chose that she should be left alone, and Fanny was obliged to pass the night by herself. She then began to reflect upon the happiness which she had known be∣fore she went to visit Lady Aubrey: she was then beloved by every one, every body met her with a smile; all the servants were ready to oblige her▪ and all the neighbours loved her: now all was changed, and no one except Sophia, no, not even her Mama, seemed to love her.
<PB N="306" REF="030190_0311_0FE508B48F64F2D0"/>
At this thought she wept bitterly. "And why am I not beloved?" said she. "And why does every one shun me, at the very time that they are so fond of my sister? Alas! it is because I am not so good as she." Fanny then thought of the vexatious situations into which she had been brought by her vanity and pride. They had caused her to be shunned not only by her inferiors, but by those above her, and had made her generally hated or despised. Heartily asham∣ed of her conduct, and grieved at its conse∣quences, she passed the greatest part of the night in weeping, and resolved that she would again be good, and again behave in such a man∣ner as should make her beloved by all, and hap∣py in herself.</P>
<P>Towards morning Fanny fell asleep, and, as she was much tired with lying awake so long, she slept till it was pretty late; the next day when she awoke, she inquired for her Mama, and was resolved to ask her forgiveness, and to inform her of her sorrow for her past faults, and her resolutions to amend. She was informed that Mrs. Dormer and Sophia were gone to the cottage, and had taken cloaths, and other necessaries for the family, and had sent for a physician to attend the sick man. "Ah!" said she, "Sophia is happy, and she deserves to be so, for she is good; I was not worthy to have the pleasure of going to the cottage, but I will begood and happy too." She then rose, and the first thing she saw was her Nosegay, which the maid had carefully put into a pot of water the night before. "This Nosegay," said Fanny, "shall be the constant memorial of my faults, and of my repentance." She then reach∣ed
<PB N="307" REF="030190_0312_0FE508BA1E4E1E20"/>
her pallet, and making a beautiful sketch of the almost dying flowers, she wrote under them in a large hand, <HI>Virtue never fades,</HI> and placed the drawing in the most conspicuous part of the room. When Mrs. Dormer returned, she was struck with this elegant performance, and calling for Fanny, had the delight of hearing from herself what had passed in her mind during the past night, and her resolutions of amend∣ment. After some time, during which Fanny had entirely laid aside her haughty behaviour, the indulgent Mrs. Dormer would have re∣moved the drawing that it might no longer mortify her child; but Fanny begged it might remain, and whenever she found herself inclined to return to her former folly, she placed herself before the picture, which soon became, not merely the shameful memorial of past faults, but the elegant monument of her return to virtue.</P>

<HEAD>COURAGE INSPIRED BY FRIENDSHIP.</HEAD>
<P>Two sailors, a Frenchman named Robert, and a native of Spain, called Antonio, were slaves to the same master at Algiers. Friendship is the only consolation of persons in distress.
<PB N="308" REF="030190_0313_0FE508C416C9C168"/>
Antonio and Robert happily enjoyed this conso∣lation—they communicated to each other their mutual griefs; they conversed perpetually about their families, their countries, and of the exqui∣site delight which the recovery of their liberty, should it ever be granted to their wishes, would afford them. Their conferences always ended in a flood of affectionate tears, and this expan∣sion of their hearts enabled them both to sup∣port the hard labour, which was their daily lot, with uncommon fortitude.</P>
<P>The task appointed them was the construc∣tion of a road on the top of a cliff which over∣hung the sea. One morning the Spaniard rest∣ing for a moment from his toil, and casting an anxious look on the sea, "My friend," said he, "all my vows, all my hopes, are directed towards the opposite bounds of that vast liquid plain; why can I not, in company with the partner of my woes, attain those happy shores? My wife, my children, are ever before my eyes, eagerly longing for my arrival, or bit∣terly lamenting my supposed death." Antonio perpetually indulged himself in these gloomy reflexions, and every day that he was summon∣ed to his work on the cliff, he turned his eyes to the ocean, and regretted the fatal expanse which separated him from his friends and his country.</P>
<P>It chanced that one day a Christian ship appeared at anchor not very distant from the shore. "There friend", cried the Spaniard, "do you see that vessel? She brings us life and liberty. Though she will not touch here, (for every one avoids these barbarous coasts) yet to∣morrow
<PB N="309" REF="030190_0314_0FE508C811D44CF0"/>
if you choose it, Robert, our woes shall end, and we will be free! Yes, to-morrow that ship will pass within a league of the shore, and we will plunge into the sea from this rock, or perish in the attempt; for even death is preferable to this cruel slavery." "If you can save yourself," replied Robert, "I shall sup∣port my unhappy lot with greater resignation. You know, Antonio, how dear you are to me; my friendship for you will only terminate with my life. I have only one favour to ask of you; endeavour to find out my father—If grief for my loss, and old age, have not already de∣stroyed him, tell him"—"What do you mean?" answered Antonio; "I seek your fa∣ther!—And do you think I could live happily a single moment with the idea of having left you in chains?" "But I cannot swim," cried Robert; "and you know"—"I know that I have the strongest friendship for you," replied the Spaniard, embracing him, and shedding tears of affection: <Q>friendship will give me re∣doubled strength: you shall hold upon my belt, and we will both save ourselves.</Q> In vain did Robert represent the danger there would be of his perishing himself, and dragging his pre∣server down with him to destruction; nothing could overcome the resolution of Antonio. <Q>We will both escape, or both perish toge∣ther,</Q> he cried. "But we draw the attention of our savage keepers; even some of our com∣panions would be base enough to betray us—Farewel—I hear the bell that calls us from our work; we must separate; farewel till to-mor∣row!"</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="030190_0315_0FE508C99CE7F2B8"/>
They now returned to their dungeon.—Antonio was wrapped up in the idea of his pro∣ject: he fancied he had already passed the Mediterranean, and was in the arms of his friends, his wife, and his children. But Ro∣bert formed to himself a very different picture: he saw his friend falling a victim to his own generosity, and dragged by him to the bottom of the sea, and perishing by that means, when, if he had only consulted his own safety, he might have preserved himself, and been restored to the bosom of his family, who most proba∣bly were continually lamenting his loss. "No," said the unfortunate Frenchman to himself, <Q>I will not give way to the solicitations of An∣tonio; I will not repay so generous a friend∣ship by being the cause of his death. He will be free. My unhappy father will at least learn that I am alive, and that my affec∣tion for him is unabated. Alas! I could wish to be the support and consolation of his age. He wanted my assistance—perhaps he is now perishing in poverty, and wishing to see and embrace his son. However, if Antonio is happy, I shall die with less re∣gret.</Q></P>
<P>The slaves were not taken from their prison the next morning at the usual hour. The Spaniard was all impatience, while Robert was in doubt whether he should rejoice or grieve at the disappointment. At length they were call∣ed to their labour, but they could not speak to each other, for their master went with them. Antonio could only look at Robert and sigh. Sometimes he cast his eyes towards the sea, and
<PB N="311" REF="030190_0316_0FE508D4E2F93388"/>
could hardly suppress his emotions. At length night arrives, and they find themselves alone. "Let us seize this opportunity," cries the Spa∣niard, "Come!" "No," replies the other: my friend I never will consent to endanger your life: farewel, Antonio! I embrace you for the last time. Save yourself, I conjure you; you have no time to lose. Remember our friendship. I only request you to remember your promise in regard to my father. He must be very old, and much in distress; go and console him. If he should want assistance, I am sure my friend"—At these words the voice of Robert failed—he shed a torrent of tears—his bosom was torn with anguish. "You weep, Robert," says Antonio; "it is not tears, but courage, that we now want: resist no longer; a moment's delay may ruin us; we may never have the opportunity again; either deliver yourself to my direction, or I will dash my head against those rocks."</P>
<P>The Frenchman threw himself at the feet of the generous Spaniard: he still represented the hazard of the attempt, and pointed out the in∣evitable danger that must attend his resolution of endeavouring to preserve him. Antonio made no reply, but catching him in his arms, he ran to the edge of the precipice, and plung∣ed with him into the sea. At first they both sunk; but, rising to the surface, Antonio ex∣erted all his force, and swimming himself, kept Robert also above the water, who seemed to re∣fuse his assistance, and to fear lest he should in∣volve him in his own destruction.</P>
<P>The people in the ship were struck with an
<FIGURE>
<PB N="312" REF="030190_0317_0FE508D6880E0300"/>
</FIGURE>
object which they could not well distinguish. They thought it was some sea-monster that ap∣proached the vessel. Their curiosity was now called another way; they saw a boat leave the shore and hastily pursue what seemed to them a monstrous sea-animal. These were the soldi∣ers who guarded the slaves, and who were anxious to overtake Antonio and Robert. The last saw them approach, and, casting his eyes on his friend, and perceiving that he grew weak, he made an effort and got loose from An∣tonio,
<PB N="313" REF="030190_0318_0FE508D81CD5DDD0"/>
saying to him at the same time. "We are pursued. Save yourself, and let me pe∣rish; I only retard your course." He had hardly finished these words when he sunk. A new transport of friendship animates the Spani∣ard; he darts towards the Frenchman, and seizing him as he is just ready to expire, they both disappeared.</P>
<P>The boat, uncertain which way to pursue, stopped; while another was sent from the vessel to discover what the object was which they had seen. The waves began to grow rough; at last they discovered two men, the one sup∣porting the other, and trying to reach the ves∣sel. They rowed to them as fast as possible, and came up with them just as Antonio's strength began to fail. They took them both on board. Antonio cried out feebly, <Q>Assist my friend—I die;</Q>—and his countenance seemed convulsed with the agonies of death. Robert, who was in a swoon, recovering at the instant, and seeing Antonio without any sign of life extended by his side, was almost dis∣tracted; he threw himself on the body of his friend. "Antonio!" he cried, "my dear Antonio, my friend, my deliverer, have I been your murderer? Alas! you cannot hear me. Is this your recompense for having saved my life? But what is life? Who can support it af∣ter the loss of such a friend?"</P>
<P>Saying this, he started up in the boat, and, seizing a sword, would have plunged it into his bosom, if he had not been disarmed; but in the midst of his lamentations and distraction, Providence, apparently to reward an affection
<PB N="314" REF="030190_0319_0FE508DB5B7F2F40"/>
so sincere, interposed in his favour—Antonio breathed a sigh. Robert flew to the assistance of his friend, who, lifting up his languid eyes, tried to find the Frenchman, and, as soon as he perceived him, cried out with a transport be∣yond his strength, "I have saved my friend!"</P>
<P>They were both conveyed on board the ves∣sel. Their exemplary friendship diffused a respect for them among the whole crew. And, such is the effect of virtue even on the rough∣est minds, every one contended with his fel∣lows in showing them attention. Robert ar∣riving in France flew to his father, who was ready to die with excess of joy at seeing him, and was appointed to a genteel office under the Government. But the Spaniard, who was likewise offered a very advantageous post, for one in his situation of life, chose rather to re∣turn to his wife and family. But absence did not diminish his friendship; he continued still to correspond with Robert, and their letters, which are master-pieces of simplicity and affec∣tion, do honour to the sentiment which was capable of producing so heroic an action.</P>

<HEAD>THE DUEL; OR THE MAN OF TRUE COURAGE.</HEAD>
<P>MELCOUR lost his parents at an age when he could not be sensible of the greatness of his mis∣fortune. One of his uncles took him home, brought him up with his own son, and paid the
<PB N="315" REF="030190_0320_0FE508E20B3ED090"/>
utmost attention to his education. Florival and Melcour, already united by the ties of kin∣dred, were soon more so by those of friendship, which, from their living constantly together, grew stronger every day. They were both de∣signed for the army. When they were of a proper age, they got commissions in the same regiment. Florival always hated application, and the dissipation that naturally attends a mi∣litary life still inclined him less to it. As for Melcour, he had not only a very good natural genius, but a strong inclination to cultivate it. His studies had been properly directed; and a generous and humane disposition, joined with a habit of thinking seriously, led him to condemn the criminal practice of fighting duels on tri∣vial occasions, a custom too prevalent in the army.</P>
<P>Different pursuits lessened, by degrees, the friendship of the two young men. Florival was blinded by the love of pleasure, he ran in∣to all sorts of extravagance, and became in∣volved in debt. Melcour lamented his folly, assisted him with his purse, and endeavoured to save him from the ruin into which he was going to plunge. He represented to him how much his conduct degraded him in the eyes of sensible people. "Even those," said he to him, "who now applaud your extravagance, will be the first to upbraid you when they see you in dis∣tress. They call themselves your best friends, and you believe them; they have estranged you from me. They have painted me to you in the most unfavourable colours, and if they have not entirely extinguished the friendship
<PB N="316" REF="030190_0321_0FE508E5A487CE80"/>
that subsisted between us, at least they have greatly weakened it. The wretches well knew my sincere affection for you; they are informed of the pains I have taken to discover to you their perfidious designs, and they wish to pu∣nish me for them. O, my friend, if they should succeed in robbing me of your esteem, their triumph will be too complete! But, my dear Florival! I do not speak on my own account only. I conjure you, by every sentiment of virtue that united our infancy, not to plunge a dagger in the heart of the best of fathers. If he were to know the excesses you run into he would die with sorrow."</P>
<P>These remonstrances touched the heart of Florival. He promised to amend; but his perfidious friends represented vice to him in so amiable a form, that he was unable to resist. Melcour being informed, that, after having lost a great sum of money at play, he was gone to dissipate his sorrow by infamous debauchery, immediately went to him, and urged to him, with some vehemence, the duties of his situa∣tion, and the promises he had made to fulfil them.</P>
<P>Florival was no longer master of himself; he fell into a most violent rage against his cou∣sin; he even drew his sword on him; and on Melcour's refusing to sight him, he abused him in the grossest terms, and was almost tempted to strike him. His cousin still kept his tem∣per: unworthy as Florival appeared of his af∣fection, he yet only regarded him as a friend and relation.</P>
<P>Overcome by this steadiness, he at length
<PB N="317" REF="030190_0322_0FE508E72FEFAAE0"/>
recovered his temper. He was ashamed of his behaviour, and begged pardon of Melcour for his violence, which was immediately granted by the generous youth, and an immediate and perfect reconciliation took place.</P>
<P>An officer belonging to another regiment happened to be present during the affair; he had been witness to the provocation given by Florival, and he imputed the coolness of his cousin to want of courage. He did not fail to make many sarcastic remarks on it, and they came at length to the ears of some of Melcour's friends. The least suspicion is deemed injuri∣ous to the honour of a soldier. After many inquiries, it was discovered whose conduct had given rise to the scandal. They were told the honour of the corps was wounded through them, and it was their duty to vindicate it. The means were evident. If the report was true, they must fight each other; if false, they must punish the author of it. Melcour was truly miserable. His principles disapproved of duelling in any instance; and in this, if he obeyed the injunctions of his corps, he was re∣duced to the terrible necessity of plunging his sword into the bosom of his relation and friend. But, in vain did he represent his feelings to his brother officers, they would hear of nothing but the choice of weapons, time, and place. His sorrow was unutterable: he retired to his apartment. Florival, who went to look for him, found him leaning on a table, hiding his face with his hands, his eyes streaming with tears, and his continual sighs only interrupted by the frequent repetition of the name of Flori∣val.
<PB N="318" REF="030190_0323_0FE508EA6E41D7B8"/>
At such a sight he was not able to con∣tain himself; he threw himself at the feet of his friend. His appearance recalled to Melcour all the horror of his situation—"What! in a moment I am called upon to pierce your heart, and do you come to seek me?—O Florival!" said he, his voice almost choaked with tears, "should my arm deprive you of life, I would not survive you. What should I say to your fa∣ther? did he take so much care of my infancy, to see me stained with the blood of his son? O, wretched old man, whatever may be the event of this horrid duel, it will be an eternal source of anguish for you!"</P>
<P>At this instant some of the officers forced open the door; they came to tell Melcour he could not delay the combat any longer without giving room to call his courage in question. What a terrible situation! At this instant the two friends were embracing each other—they were unable to return any answer.</P>
<P>Florival was the first who broke this mourn∣ful silence. In him the mistaken principles of honour at present prevailed over those of friend∣ship. He got up, and extended his arm to as∣sist Melcour, without daring to look at him. He arose and walked about the room in the greatest agitation; he fancied he saw his rela∣tion and friend murdered by his hands, and his distracted uncle demanding vengeance for the blood of his son. At length, recovering himself, he turned to the officers, and said to to them in a firm and resolute tone of voice: I will no longer hesitate to act the part which is pointed out to me by the voice of religion, of
<PB N="319" REF="030190_0324_0FE508F42A6E2EC0"/>
reason, and of humanity, be the consequence what it may. My determination is fixed. Go, and inform those who sent you, that Melcour prefers an <HI>imaginary</HI> dishonour to a <HI>real</HI> crime, and that no consideration upon earth shall tempt him to point his sword against the bosom of his friend. This answer determined his fate. His brother officers informed him with the sincerest regret, that, as he had refused to fight, it was impossible for them to roll with him, and that he must quit the regiment. Who can describe the feelings of Florival, when he heard this sentence? it was <HI>be</HI> who had brought Melcour into this terrible situation. The disgrace of his cousin was owing to <HI>his</HI> follies. These thoughts almost drove him to distraction. His friends were alarmed for the consequences, and removed him by force from the mournful scene.</P>
<P>Melcour, left to himself, soon determined what steps to take. He was determined not to return home, to be there exposed to a disgrace he was conscious of not deserving. He resolv∣ed to endeavour to improve the talents which Nature had endowed him with by travelling, till time should either obliterate the memory of this unfortunate adventure, or show it in its true light. That very evening he made the proper preparations for his journey, and wrote a letter to his cousin, acquainting him with his intended expedition. "Inform my uncle," he added, "of all that has happened; let him know that they wanted to compel me to be∣come your murderer. He will shudder at the thought. Though these barbarians, guided
<PB N="320" REF="030190_0325_0FE508F5C873CD98"/>
only by a false sense of honour, think me un∣worthy to serve my king and country, he at least will applaud the courageous efforts I have made to preserve us both from a crime. This lesson, my dear Florival, will be of ad∣vantage to you; your eyes are now opened to the conduct of your companions. Still conti∣nue your regard for me; and never esteem me unhappy while I preserve a place in your friend∣ship."</P>
<P>He set out at day-break the next morning, accompanied by a single servant. He had not gone many miles from the garrison when he saw a large detachment of the enemy on the point of defeating an inferior number of French troops. He could not behold his countrymen in danger of being vanquished without burning with ardour to assist them. Regardless of the danger of the attempt, he only listened to the call of glory; and this Melcour, whose cou∣rage his brother officers had presumed to ques∣tion, flew to the field of battle, performed pro∣digies of valour, took one of the enemy's co∣lours, and animating his countrymen by his example, they obtained the victory.</P>
<P>The general officer who commanded the de∣tachment was charmed with the bravery of the young warrior, and earnestly desired to know his name. "Sir," he replied, "I will tell you who I am directly; but, will you give me leave first to ask, what is the immediate desti∣nation of your detachment?" "It is going," said he, "to reinforce the neighbouring garri∣son," (naming that which Melcour had left.) "of which I am to take the command," <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
<PB N="321" REF="030190_0326_0FE508F750D6F578"/>
Sir," said Melcour, "if you will permit me, I will attend you thither, and receive there those marks of your approbation that you shall be pleased to honour me with."</P>
<P>They arrived. "Sir," said Melcour, "the only favour I ask of you, is to call together the officers of the regiment of ***" (that which he had quitted); they assembled, and Melcour appeared. "Behold, gentlemen," said he, "the unfortunate victim of a false ho∣nour, to which you sacrifice every thing, though it often renders you cruel and unjust. Because I refused to stain my hands with the blood of a relation younger than myself, and who had ex∣piated a very slight offence by the most unequi∣vocal marks of sorrow and repentance; because I listened to the voice of religion and humanity; because I respected the laws, you have judged me unworthy to carry arms in the service of my country. Blinded by prejudice, you have dared to accuse me of cowardice. For that accusation I have taken ample revenge. These colours, taken from the enemy, are a suffici∣ent testimony of my courage." His brother officers surrounded him, and embracing him, by the praises they lavished on him, and the ex∣cuses they made, they atoned for the rash suspi∣cions they had entertained of him.</P>
<P>The general, astonished and charmed with the behaviour of Melcour, pressed him to re∣sume his rank for the present, till he could have an opportunity of reporting so gallant an action to the minister. Melcour yielded to his solici∣tations, seconded by those of the officers of the regiment. "Accept," said the general, "that
<PB N="322" REF="030190_0327_0FE508FA5EC574E8"/>
commission you was deprived of yesterday, as a tacit avowal of the injustice of that prejudice which condemned you, and may your example entirely root it out!" Then turning to the of∣ficers who surrounded him, he added: "Let the behaviour of this virtuous young man teach you, for the future, not to accuse that person of cowardice, who, obedient to the laws of true honour, and of his country, refuses to become a murderer. Renounce, gentlemen, that fatal error, which shows you the man of true courage in him who is not afraid to wash out an injury in the blood of his fellow citizen: behold him rather in the person who has greatness of soul to be above the desire of revenge. For the fu∣ture, defer your quarrels till the day of battle, and let the contests for superior resolution be decided in the face of the enemies of your king and country. Or, if the insult offered you is amenable to the laws, let the laws fix that ignominy on your adversary that his conduct may deserve. But, let your warmest praises be bestowed on Melcour, and on those who have the magnanimity to follow the example he has this day given us."</P>
<P>It is impossible to describe the transports of Florival during this affecting scene. From that moment he renounced his fatal errors, and, strictly keeping the solemn promises he had made to his friend, and profiting by his exam∣ple, they both were raised to the highest stati∣ons in the army, which they filled with the greatest honour to themselves, their family, and their country.</P>

<P>EMMELINE was the daughter of a gentleman of large fortune; she was always dressed in the most elegant manner; her nursery was filled with the most expensive toys, and she had se∣veral servants to wait upon her. If she wished for any thing, however absurd in itself, or in∣capable of pleasing her when obtained, yet Emmeline must be indulged. Not a servant in the house was suffered to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="324" REF="030190_0329_0FE5090472A9E110"/>
sometimes, if they happened to displease her, she would scratch and beat them in the most violent manner. Notwithstanding her finery, and her superfluity of toys, notwithstanding she had every thing at her command which riches could procure, and every one was striving to make her happy, she was a most miserable lit∣tle girl. Her tyrannical temper made her universally disliked, even by those who were obliged to be subservient to her, and her fret∣fulness and ill humour was a constant thorn in her own bosom.</P>
<P>At the entrance of her father's park stood a lodge, which was inhabited by a poor man who had also one daughter. Little Jenny was one of the best tempered girls in the world; she was never seen crying and out of humour like Emmeline, but on the contrary, was civil and obliging to every body. There was not a ser∣vant at the hall but loved her as if she had been their own child; and never did they go down to the lodge, but they were sure to carry her an apple, or a piece of plum-cake, or some∣thing, nice in their pockets. It frequently hap∣pened that Jenny was sent for to play with Em∣meline, which she did not like at all, for the young lady was so whimsical it was impossible to please her, and frequently would desire Jenny to do what was very improper. On such oc∣casions the would never comply; for though she paid the haughty little girl every respect which was due to her rank, she never forgot what was due to herself: well knowing that a wrong ac∣tion is equally culpable, whether he person who tempts us to commit it, be poor or rich.
<PB N="325" REF="030190_0330_0FE50905FAE1EDC8"/>
If in their play they happened to break any thing, Emmeline would desire Jenny to say it was one of the servants who did it; and when she refused to be guilty of so wicked an action, Emmeline would put herself in a violent passion, and frequently beat her. In short it is not to be conceived how disagreeable she made her∣self. She was also very ignorant; she could neither read, nor write; for though she had several masters, not one of them attended her more than three or four lessons. Mrs. Gordon would not permit her to be reprimanded, and no one could long endure her unrestrained inso∣lence. She was therefore unacquainted with the most common branches of learning, and when Jenny, who was nearly the same age, could read very well, Emmeline scarcely knew her letters. Jenny was one day as usual sent for to the hall, and when she arrived she found the young lady in the parlour with her Papa and Mama, who were endeavouring to divert her by a great variety of very pretty prints, which they had sent for from London. She looked at them a little time, and then being tired, tossed them away. Jenny took one to look at, when Emmeline snatching it from her, asked her how she dared touch it? <Q>I beg your pardon, Miss Emmeline, said she but I was only going to look at it.</Q></P>

</SP>
<P>They went into the garden, accompanied by a servant, for Emmeline was never suffered to move without one. As they were running about, Emmeline happened to fall, and scratch her arm against a gooseberry bush. She im∣mediately began to cry and shriek so loud, that in a few minutes her Papa, Mama, and half the servants came running to see what was the matter. Mrs. Gordon chided the servant very much for the accident, though she well knew it was in no servant's power to prevent her daugh∣ter's doing what she liked. Mr. Gordon took her in his arms, and carried her into the house; but it was some hours before she could be paci∣fied. Such was the child, whom unbounded indulgence had totally spoiled, for Emmeline had not naturally bad dispositions. With in∣creasing years, her faults increased also, and her parents then began to see, and lament the folly of their conduct. Every pleasure, every comfort of their lives were totally destroyed. They could not enjoy their own home from the wretched temper of their daughter, nor were they happier when abroad, as their fears for her safety were ever awake. They knew no one
<PB N="327" REF="030190_0332_0FE50910ABF743A8"/>
could controul her, and that however dangerous what she had a fancy for, that, she would do. They were invited to spend a month at a gen∣tleman's seat at some miles distance. Not with∣out great reluctance did they accept the invita∣tion; but at length it was determined Jenny should stay with Emmeline during their ab∣sence. Poor Jenny dreaded the persecution she knew she must endure, and when she put on her bonnet to go to the hall, she could not help crying. The first day of her visit was spent much as usual; but the second, Emmeline was if possible, more ill tempered than ever; and Jenny, tired beyond all endurance, thus ad∣dressed her: <Q>Miss Emmeline, I am come here, not because I wish it, but because your Mama, has desired it; do not therefore think that I will be treated in this manner. I know that I am poor, and you are rich; but yet, Miss Emmeline I would not change situations with you. Of what use to you is your rank, but to enable you to torment others, and to make every one as unhappy as yourself? I do not believe the poorest beggar suffers more than you do. You have riches, but you do not know how to enjoy them, and though you call yourself great, nobody loves you.</Q></P>
<P>This was language Emmeline had never be∣fore heard; she would have uttered the effusi∣ons of her passion, but shame kept her silent. She felt a sensation she had never experienced; and inferiority wholly new. How much did this little peasant appear superior to herself? how was all her boasted consequence dwindled to nothing?</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="030190_0333_0FE509141CB1E2E0"/>
Such is the power of Virtue, that even the wicked are awed by it. From that time Emme∣line felt a veneration for Jenny she knew not how to account for. She saw how happy she always appeared, how much she was beloved, and in short, how different she was in every re∣spect to herself. These reflexions first con∣vinced her of her folly, in imagining she could ever be happy if she was not good. She re∣solved to imitate the conduct she could not but admire, and, if possible, to become amiable. But she found this a very hard task; she had not only virtues to acquire, but faults to con∣quer which <Q>had grown with her growth, and strengthened with her strength.</Q> But yet, though it was difficult, it was not impossible; she told her resolution to Jenny, who could scarcely contain the raptures she felt at hearing this declaration; and she thought Emmeline had never appeared so lovely as in that moment. Her countenance was no longer clouded by frowns and tears; she began to feel what hap∣piness virtue can bestow, and that it is she alone who makes us truly great.</P>
<P>Very often did she relapse into her former habits, but reflexion, by pointing out their fol∣ly, and experience, by showing their misery, fortified her mind to resist their attacks; Jen∣ny too was near, and assisted her to conquer them. Hitherto the profusion of money, which the too great indulgence of her parents had al∣lowed her, had been spent in cakes, sugar∣plums, and toys; but now, a new source of de∣light was opened to her; she tasted the charms of benevolence, and her bosom was warmed by
<PB N="329" REF="030190_0334_0FE50915AA2D64D0"/>
the emanations of charity. The poor of the village saw in her a rising benefactress, and the widow and the orphan prayed for her happiness. The servants too, whom she now treated in a very different manner, respected her as much as they had before despised her; and every one was eager to wait upon, and oblige her. As for Jenny, by whose example and advice the little tyrant had been reclaimed (for it was she who had taught her to pray Heaven to assist her good intentions) it is impossible to say with what warmth of affection she loved her. Her stay at the hall was no longer disagreeable to her, no longer occasioned dread and uneasiness.</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. Gordon had been persuaded by their friends to extend their visit a month longer. So uncomfortable was their own home, that they agreed to it with much less reluctance than they would otherwise have done. Two months, therefore, they had been absent, when they began to prepare for their return. The pleasure they would have felt in seeing Emme∣line after this long absence, was much damped by the consciousness how ill she deserved their affection: yet themselves only had they to blame; for her heart was good, and naturally inclined to virtue; but <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> destructive are the consequences of unrestrained indulgence, that human nature is vitiated by it.</P>
<P>The first glance Emmeline caught of the car∣riage among the trees, her heart began to beat with unusual sensations. She felt the painful emotions of conscious shame; she knew how ill she had requited the tenderness of her parents, and after a struggle with some <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="330" REF="030190_0335_0FE50918D137BAE8"/>
sparks of pride, she determined to confess her faults, and entreat her parents' forgiveness. As soon as they entered the house, she express∣ed in a manner very different from her former habits, the joy she felt at seeing them. They clasped her to their bosoms, and looked at each other in silent astonishment. They now began to display the profusion of toys, which they had brought her home, and asked her how she liked them? She made no answer, but bursting into an agony of tears, threw herself on her knees before them, and declared her conduct had hi∣therto made her unworthy their goodness, but she would in future endeavour to deserve it more.</P>
<P>Inexpressible were the raptures of Mr. and Mrs. Gordon, they could not find words to de∣clare their feelings, but each endeavoured to exceed the other in the most affectionate ca∣resses. She now constituted their happiness as truly as she had before been the cause of their sorrow. Her bad habits had been too long in∣dulged to yield to any thing but time and re∣solution; yet her relapses were short, and the contrition she felt, was her best security against their return. When her parents were informed it was to Jenny they were in a great measure in∣debted for their daughter's reformation, they determined their gratitude should equal her virtue.</P>
<P>Emmeline had very soon a worthy woman provided as a governess for her, to whom she was docile, obedient, and attentive; and made so rapid a progress in her studies, that she asto∣nished all who had known her former ignorance.
<PB N="331" REF="030190_0336_0FE50922B0A08838"/>
Jenny was kept at the hall, and shared in the pleasure and instructions of her friend, to whom she every day became dearer.</P>
<P>From this story, my little readers may learn the benign influence of Virtue. Vain are rich∣es, vain the boast of power without it! They can never raise any one so high as Virtue.</P>
<P>Let them consider Emmeline and Jenny. How much was the latter, though cloathed in the simplest manner, superior to her haughty friend, even when decked in the most costly at∣tire! Let none then despise Poverty, it is often found the residence of Virtue. Let them pay to merit what is always its due, though found in the humblest walks of life. And let every one remember there is no real superiority but that of Goodness; and that it is equally the part of Wisdom and Virtue, to efface the wild ine∣quality, the distinctions paid alone to rank and riches, which pride and folly have introduced into the world.</P>
