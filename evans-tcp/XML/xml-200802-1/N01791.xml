<Q><BIBL>REVELATION III.I.</BIBL>
— I know thy works, that thou hast a Name that thou Livest, and art Dead.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>CONSIDERING the curious Workmanship of God, in the Regularity, comely Proportion and mutual Usefulness of all things, in their Original Frame &amp; Contexture; and how all kinds of Creatures did serve in their several Places, and accord∣ing to their several Capacities, to shew forth the Glory of Him who gave them their Being, Beauty and Activity; 'tis a wonderful and abasing Consideration, to every Contempla∣tive
<PB N="2" REF="002123_0004_0FBC1F55DCF8C750"/>
&amp; Serious Soul, that there is now no more Stability and Decency, especially in humane Proceedings. But that Darkness, Disorder, Sin and Death, have thus Invaded, and over∣run the World. Indeed the World has suf∣fered Miserable Overthrow and Ship wreck; but it is a strange as sad, that nothing will reduce the Children of Men, to that Love &amp; Obedience to their Maker which was Origi∣nally founded in their Natures.</P>
<P>When the Lord appeared in his Greatness on Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> it look't as if men would be afraid to be <HI>bad Israelites</HI>; and in His Gracious∣ness on Mount-<HI>Sion,</HI> as if men would be per∣swaded to be <HI>strict Christians</HI>: but thus it is, Scarcely any thing less than <HI>Heaven,</HI> will make the Saint Serious; or any thing less than <HI>Hell,</HI> will make the Sinner Silent. There is and will be Sin in the best of Saints; and Sinners in the best Regulated Societies &amp; Churches.</P>
<P>Indeed the Apostolick was a truly Golden Age; yet in the Churches of Christ there was Dross as well as pure Gold; there were Infirm Saints, &amp; bold Sinners Hypocrites &amp; False∣hearted, as well as Sound and Sincere Pro∣fessors.</P>
<P>The Apostle mentioned in the beginning of this Book, spent great part of his Ministry among the seven Churches of the <HI>lesser Asia</HI>;
<PB N="3" REF="002123_0005_0FBC1F576AA2BFC8"/>
and most of them were grown Corrupt &amp; De∣fective, when he wrote to them from the Isle, where he was Confined, for the Testimony of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>This Book in General Contains many Pro∣phetick Visions; and in them a solemn repre∣sentation of the present and succeeding State of the Church of Christ.</P>
<P>This Epistle is particularly directed to the Seven Principal Churches of this <HI>Lesser Asia,</HI> and the three First Chapters altho' they ex∣presly mention these Churches and no others, yet (the number Seven in Scripture Signifying a compleat thing) they Indifferently respect the Universal, under such like circumstances.</P>
<P>In the first part of this Chapter, the Apostle directs himself to the Church in <HI>Sardis,</HI> in the Person of the Angel or Overseer of it. Where we have.</P>
<P N="1">I. A Description of its State. That altho' it had a <HI>Name to Live,</HI> yet <HI>was really Dead,</HI> or at lesst <HI>ready to Die.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. A Remedy prescribed against the Disease, under which it Laboured. <HI>Be Watchful, &amp;c. Remember therefore, how thou hast received, and heard, and hold fast and repent:</HI> To return to their first state, &amp; have recourse to the primi∣tive institution, &amp; form of Doctrine delivered to them by the Apostles &amp; Apostolical men.
<PB N="4" REF="002123_0006_0FBC1F5A73277198"/>
Doubtless <HI>Tertullian</HI>'s Rule borrowed from hence, is very safe &amp; may be depended upon, viz. <HI>Quicquid primum Illud verum.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. A Threatning denounced in case of neg∣lect <HI>If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come upon thee as a Thief. v.</HI> 3.</P>
<P N="4">4. A Commendation given to some who had kept themselves from those Corruptions, which prevail'd among the rest: together with due Incouragement given to all to return to God. <HI>v.</HI> 4. &amp; 5.</P>
<P>What I would take notice of in the Words read; is a discovery of the Unsound (or a General Description of the) Condition of the once Gloriou Church of Christ in <HI>Sardis.</HI> And it is put in mind,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>What it was in Name.</HI> Or what it seem'd to be. <HI>Thou hast a Name that thou livest.</HI> It not only retained its Name of Christian Church, and made a Publick Profession of the only true Religion in the World, but was Favoured with agreeable Advantages; and so might be yet very considerable, in the ac∣count of such as took notice of the outside, or shew, but not of the Power of Religion.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>When it was in Reality: And art Dead.</HI> Not Absolutely, but Comparatively; for there were a few names in <HI>Sardis</HI> that had not Defiled their Garments. Altho the general∣lity
<PB N="5" REF="002123_0007_0FBC1F5CA3DD32B8"/>
were gone off from God, yet there were some few that cleaved to him. As for rest altho'they might retain somewhat of the form of Godliness, yet had in a great Measure lost that good Spirit, which had before Influ∣enced them, and kept them alive. So that they were now Dead. Or as said in the next Verse, <HI>ready to Die.</HI> What ever the World thought' of them, or they of them∣selves; altho their Profession might be high, and their Advantages considerable, yet they were evidently and certainly Languishing.</P>
<P>Hence the Truth which offers it self to us; &amp; may be Insisted on at this time is this, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>That a People may, &amp; sometimes have a Name to Live; and yet are really in a Dying Condition.</P>
<P>A Man may esteem himself, &amp; be look't up∣on by others as having a healthy &amp; firm Con∣stitution; when some fatal Disease has Seised him in a Vital Part. A Man may nave the Advantage of a fair Estate, and yet be really Poor. And not only a Person, but a People may seem to be something, when they are nothing. The Church of the <HI>Laodiceans</HI> said it was <HI>Rich &amp; increased in Goods,</HI> and had <HI>need of nothing.</HI> And yet was <HI>Wretched, &amp; Miserable, &amp; Poor, &amp; Blind, &amp; Naked.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="002123_0008_0FBC1F5E356C54A0"/>And if we look back to <HI>Israel</HI> of Old we shall find, that there was no Nation upon Earth so Favoured; that had such a Name and privi∣ledges: <HI>God did lead his people like a Flock, by the hand of Moses &amp; Aaron.</HI> Psal. 77. ult. <HI>Moses</HI> was as a King in the Army; and <HI>Aaron</HI> Mi∣nistered in things that were Typical &amp; Sacred: <HI>Moses</HI> brought their causes before GOD; and <HI>Aaron</HI> Offered their Sacrifices to God, and <HI>Israel</HI> had Laws, Statutes, Judgments and Or∣dinances accordingly: Yet were they a <HI>Proud, Stiff-necked, Murmuring, Unbelieving, Ugrateful &amp; Idolatrous People</HI>; And did Backslide from God, with a perpetual Backsliding.</P>
<P><HI>Baalam</HI> in the Twenty-third and Twenty∣forth Chapters of <HI>Numbers,</HI> seems to be Trans∣ported, at the light of <HI>Israels</HI> Glory &amp; Felicity: And yet in the very next Chapter, we Read of <HI>Isrels</HI> Committing Whoredom with the Daughters of <HI>Moab,</HI> and Joyning themselves unto <HI>Baal-peor.</HI></P>
<P>David says 2 Sam. 7.23.2.4. <HI>What one nation in the Earth, is like thy people even Israel—For than hast Confirmed to thy self thy people Israel to be a people unto thee forever: And thou Lord art become their God.</HI> Yet are they often Branded in Scripture with that Character of a <HI>Rebellious house.</HI> And in the time of the Gospel our SAVIOUR calls then <HI>Serpents,</HI> and <HI>Generation of Vipers.</HI> The
<PB N="7" REF="002123_0009_0FBC1FB7619D50F0"/>
Martyr <HI>Stephen</HI> (after he had given them a short account how Gods gentleness had made them great) calls them <HI>Stiff-necked, &amp; Uncir∣cumcised in Heart, and Ears</HI>; Tells them that they did <HI>always Resist the Holy Ghost; as their Fathers did so did they. Which of the Prophets</HI> (said he) <HI>have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the just One, of whom ye have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the betrayers &amp; murderers: Who have r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ived the law by the disposition of Angels, and have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> kept it,</HI> Act. 7. 5I, 52, 53.</P>
<P><HI>Israel</HI> indeed did sometimes revive a little; when God raised up some Eminent Reformers of poured out his Wrath upon them in ter∣rible manner. Yet their returnings to God were Ordinarily Hypocritical, or Partial, or of no long continuance: For indeed the Body of them were rotten at the Heart, and their Wound Incurable.</P>
<P>In Speaking to the Truth before us, I shall Consider,</P>
<P N="1">I. When a People may be said to have a Name to Live.</P>
<P N="2">II. When they may be said to be in Dy∣ing Condition. And,</P>
<P N="3">III. What makes such a People thus De∣cline and Languish.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="8" REF="002123_0010_0FBC1FB8E42BBC30"/>I. <HI>When a People may be said to have a Name to Live.</HI> Now a People may be said to have a Name to Live, on the account of the great shew &amp; appearance which they make of Li∣ving. Now in this a Peoples real Advantages may be very considerable. And at this time we shall rather insist on the Privileges &amp; Ad∣vantages which a People Enjoy, than upon the meer Profession &amp; shew which they make.</P>
<P>So then People may be said to have a Name to Live, on the account,</P>
<P N="1">(I.) Of their <HI>Civil.</HI> (2.) Of their <HI>Sacred Interests</HI> and Advantages.</P>
<P N="1">[I.] With respect to their <HI>Civil Advantages</HI> &amp; Priviledges. And this may be considered.</P>
<P N="1">I. With respect to the Rules by which a People are Guided. And</P>
<P N="2">2. With respect to the Rulers by whom they are Governed.</P>
<P N="1">(I.) With respect to the <HI>Rules</HI> by which a People are Guided. And they are contained in a certain Body of Laws, Composed, Altered, &amp; Increased, by Persons of great Wisdom, Fi∣delity &amp; Piety ('tis like not without many Serious Prayers to God) &amp; so Accommodated to the State, &amp; Circumstances of that People for whom they are made.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) With respect to the <HI>Rulers</HI> by whom they are Governed. And they are such (for
<PB N="9" REF="002123_0011_0FBC1FBB9927C9F0"/>
'tis supposed that nothing hinders except among a People themselves, but that they may have such to Rule over them if such there be) as are qualifyed according to the direction of Gods Word.</P>
<P>And so under whose Wise &amp; Faithful Con∣duct, a People may sit safely, and Comfortably under their own Vines and Fig-trees: The Feeble, the Simple, the Poor, the Fatherless &amp; Widow, may Shelter themselves from the Violence and Fury of the Oppressor. Mens Lives, Liberties &amp; Properties may be Secured from the Malignant, Proud and Covetous: Controversies may be Decided, doubtful Causes Determined; Good Orders Establish∣ed, the Vertuous Incouraged, Well-doers Re∣warded; Criminals, Prophane and Profligate Persons Punished, and brought to Shame. In a word all things that tend to a Peoples Ad∣vancement, may be farthered; and all things that tend to their Ruine and Dissolution Suppressed.</P>
<P>Moreover such Rulers are as a <HI>Fortress, and Bulwark to Religion.</HI> For such Incourage, Command, and see to it, that Ministers, and Men of all Ranks and Conditions, Worship God in a Solemn Manner; that God be Pub∣lickly Magnify'd for all his Favours. That Men Humble themselves for their Sins, and
<PB N="10" REF="002123_0012_0FBC1FBD5ADA1988"/>
under Gods Judgments. They Discounte∣nance and Punish bold Intruders, &amp; such as Advance Damnable Doctrines and endeavour to Subvert the Established Religion; the In∣terrupters of Gods Worship and Ordinances, the Prophaners of Gods Holy Sabbaths, the Blasphemous, and such like.</P>
<P N="2">[2.] In respect to their <HI>Sacred Interests,</HI> and Privileges.</P>
<P>As,</P>
<P>When they have the True Word of God among them; and that in their own proper Dialect, which they may use without restraint, and in which they have a sufficient account concerning God, &amp; themselves; of the Works of God in Creation, Providence &amp; Redemption; Precepts to Awaken, Oblige &amp; Guide them; &amp; Promises to Quicken amp; Encourage them. Or in a Word whatsoever is necessary to Furnish men throughly to every good Thought and Affection, Word and Action. Also when a People have God himself nigh them, ready to hear their Crys, to Correct their Errors, to Supply their Wants, and to give His Holy Spirit to them that ask Him. Moreover when a People have Gods Ministers, who Labour to Convince their Consciences, to stir their Af∣fections &amp; Inclinations; especially in things that relate to Faith, Repentance and New∣Obedience;
<PB N="11" REF="002123_0013_0FBC1FBE2D1F50B8"/>
do Solemnly Administer the Seals of the New Covenant, Reprove Sinners, and cut off the Incorrigible from the Inheri∣tance of the Lord.</P>
<P>Now altho' a People so Favoured, may be Languishing and Dying with respect to their Spirit and Practice, in things truly amiable; yet these things put them under great Ad∣vantages of moving, toward the Unity of the Faith, &amp; of the Knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect Man, unto the measure of the Stature of the fulness of Christ, as the Apostle expresseth it, <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.I3.</P>
<P>We may say concerning such a People, as <HI>Moses</HI> concerning Israel, — <HI>That the natios which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise &amp; understanding people. For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, as the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon him for? And what nation is there so great, that has statutes &amp; judgments so righteous</HI> —? Deut. 4, 6, 7, 8. It was spoken of, as a singular Favour, that God made known <HI>His word unto Jacob, His statutes and judgments unto Israel.</HI> Psal. I47.I9. Such a People ride upon the High Places of the Earth, and God feeds them with the Heritage of <HI>Jacob</HI> their Father. <HI>Isa.</HI> 58.I4.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="12" REF="002123_0014_0FBC1FBFC1A4A780"/>II. <HI>When a People may be said to be in a Dying Condition.</HI> And</P>
<P N="1">I. When they are going from, their first Estate: are past their Flourishing Years. All things have their turns of Goodliness &amp; Beau∣ty; Vegetables, and all kinds of Living Crea∣tures have their Springing &amp; Increasing Season: For God <HI>hath made every thing Beautiful in His time.</HI> Eccl. 3.II. Yet as there is a <HI>Time to be Born,</HI> so likewise is there a <HI>Time to Die.</HI> And as there is a time with Common-Wealths, Churches, Towns, particular Families, &amp; Per∣sons, when all things look like a rising Sun, &amp; Spring Morning; so it sometimes happens that there is a Change in the Countenance &amp; Complexion of all these things. As there is a time to rise, so ordinarily a time to fall. The Wise man gives us a very apt Figurative De∣scription, of the Decline of Humane Strength &amp; Glory; the Decrepit State of the Children of Men, after a considerable space of Health, Strength, Beauty and Activity. <HI>In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkned, And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the Bird, And all the daughters of musick shall be brought low;
<PB N="13" REF="002123_0015_0FBC1FC11FB55328"/>
Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond-tree shall flourish &amp; the grashopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail,</HI> Eccl. I2. 3, 4, 5. Thus the Eyes are dim, the Ears dull, the Countenance wan and pale; and many other Symptoms of a Declining condition.</P>
<P>When a People have had their Flourishing time, and are past the Flower of their Age; If Justice, Righteousness, Holiness, Meekness, Brotherly-kindness, &amp; Charity, meet with ano∣ther manner of Entertainment than hereto∣fore; it would be as Wonderful as Comfortable, if such a People should again return to the days of their Youth.</P>
<P N="2">2. When the means used for a Peoples Re∣covery prove Ineffectual. Altho' the Body natural be Incident to divers kinds of Dis∣eases, yet there is generally Balm, &amp; Physitians to be had; but in case the Physitians be Skil∣ful and Faithful, the Means used Proper and Suitable against the Disease, and yet take no good Effect, the Disease seems Deadly, and the Wound Incurable. Thus when a People are come to that pass, that neither Sickness, or Health, War or Peace, Scarcity or Plenty, Mercies or Judgments, Corrosives or Leni∣tives; the unweared endeavours of the Magis∣tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ministry avail, to a Peoples Con∣version;
<PB N="14" REF="002123_0016_0FBC1FC2A0608F18"/>
or so much as to any considerable degree of Reformation; but a People will run over Law and Gospel, and do that which is right in their own Eyes, in Despite of the Powers above and below; they are like the Ground that Yearly brings forth nothing <HI>but Briers &amp; Thorns</HI>; (Notwithstanding its drink∣ing in the rains that come oft upon it) and is therefore Rejected nigh unto Cursing, <HI>Heb.</HI> 6 8 Or like the Vineyard, which after all that was bestowed upon it, brought forth nothing but <HI>Wild Grapes</HI>; and was therefore Condemned to be laid waste, <HI>Isa.</HI> 5.6.</P>
<P N="3">3. When a People have no Heart, and so will take no pains to help themselves. Not only refuse, and scorn the Help of others, but will do nothing for their own Relief. Either are so Stupid that they have lost all manner of sense of their Condition, or else are so Listless, that they will rather run the Chance and Hazard, of every thing that is Dear &amp; Valu∣able, than be at any considerable Pains and Charges, for their own Deliverance. Now when a People are so Besotted, and Stupify'd, that they are grown into an Indifferency whe∣ther they Live or Die, they'l tamely Yield to the course of their Disease; if it Mitigate of it self well; if it rage it's all alike. Sometimes a People are so Infatuated by Satan, and Buried
<PB N="15" REF="002123_0017_0FBC1FC4846D0E80"/>
in their own Vanitys, that they have not a thought about diverting the course of their Sins, or Gods Judgments: They Imitate the Old World, that could Eat &amp; Drink, Marry Wives, &amp; give in Marriage, till Noe entered into the Ark, and so the Flood came and De∣stroyed them all. And likewise <HI>Sodom,</HI> that could Eat and Drink, Buy and Sell, Plant and Build, until the Day that Lot left them; and it Rained Fire and Brimstone from Heaven, and Destroyed them all, <HI>Luk.</HI> I7.27, 28, 29. Now such a People (and more especially, a Professing, and Priviledged People;) as have no Heart nor Spirit, to Reflect on their Wick∣edness; to look into their Spiritual Condition; but can say to themselves, Take your Ease, Eat, Drink and be Merry; when the very Heavens are ready to reveal their Iniquity, and the Earth to rise up against them; verily such a People are Dying with a Witness: They are at least in the way to Commit all Iniquity with Greediness; and to treat God, &amp; all that is Good with High-handed Contempt.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>We shall consider, What makes such a Peo∣ple Decline and Languish.</HI> And here I intend only to give a few hints at some Plain and Obvious Things, that Hurt and Weaken a People. And</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="16" REF="002123_0018_0FBC1FC59C24A6A0"/>I. <HI>The Unexemplariness of Men that make a Principal Figure, in the Places where they Live</HI>: And this, on the Account either of their Age, Abilitys, Profession or Improve∣ment either in Town, Church or Common∣Wealth. If such as these don't carry it well, are False to their Word; to their Trust; are Contentious, Covetous, Uncharitable, Proud, Intemperate, Unjust, Cruel, Wanton, and the like: I may say that such as these (especially) by such manners, do give a deep Wound to Religion, &amp; Vertue, in the Places where they Live. And the ill Savour of these things will Diffuse it self as far as their Improvement and Names Extend. As Dead Flies in the Oint∣ment of the Apothecary, causes it to send forth a stinking Savour: So doth a little Folly him that is in Reputation for Wisdom, &amp; Ho∣nour, <HI>Eccl.</HI> I0.I. And as on the one hand such are had in abomination by the truly Pious, and such as are hurt by their Unexemplary Conduct; so on the other hand, many will make use of such mens Lives, as an Argument to Justify, or a Cloak to Cover, their Practi∣cal Contempt of Vertue, &amp; Goodness. There is in many a great Ambition to Imitate those that are above them, in Vice as well as Vertue.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>And</HI> (which was touched in the fore∣going particular) <HI>the Disproportion there is
<PB N="17" REF="002123_0019_0FBC1FC8F8EEE7C8"/>
between the Pretences and Practice of many High Professors, hurts a People.</HI> Some make a Loud Noise about Religion; cry out concerning the Sins of a Land; are very severe in censuring others; give Sacred Things a high Character; are Zealous for God and Christ in Words and Gestures; and yet are themselves very Cor∣rupt, &amp; Defective in some considerable Arti∣cles of a Christian Life. It may be they <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Tithe, of Mint, Anise, &amp; Cummin</HI>; and yet Omit <HI>the Weightier matters of the Law,</HI> Judgment, Mercy and Faith. Do <HI>Strain at a Gnat,</HI> and <HI>Swallow a Camel, Mat.</HI> 23.23, 24. Make their <HI>Boast of the Law,</HI> and yet through <HI>breaking the Law Dishonour God,</HI> as the Apostle Expresseth it, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.23. Such are Disserviceable to Re∣ligion; for if they be Men of an Established Reputation, many will do like them, ex∣pecting to Fare in the Day of Judgment as well as such: As for others as men loath them because they esteem them Hypocrites, so many will be ready to Abhor the very Religion of which such make so notable a Profession.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Declining Religious Communication; especially by the Wiser sort of Men Weakens a Peo∣ple.</HI> God Commanded Israel, not only to re∣tain His Words in their Hearts: But <HI>to talk of them when they sat in their Houses,</HI> when they <HI>Walked by the Way,</HI> when they <HI>lay Down</HI> &amp; when
<PB N="18" REF="002123_0020_0FBC1FCA30728EB0"/>
<HI>they Arose, Deut.</HI> 6.7. Doubtless the design in this Charge was, that the Knowledge and Love of these things, might be Preserved, and Promoted among them. But this is (it may be) by many of the Abler sort, accounted a Con∣temptible way of Improving their Talents; they think it more proper for the Weak and Feeble part of Mankind. But this is no Dis∣honour to Men of Understanding: The Psalmist thought so, when he Declared that <HI>he would speak of Gods Testimonies before kings and not be ashamed, Psal.</HI> II9.46 Were these things duely Maintained, &amp; Promoted among both Great and Small, and the Great would Soberly Condescend to Men of Low Degree, 'twould it may be give no little Life &amp; Energy to Religion and Goodness among a People; for so all would be Directed, Comforted, and Encouraged. <HI>Ointment &amp; Perfume, Rejoyce the Heart; so doth the sweetness of a mans Friend by hearty Counsel. Iron sharpneth Iron, so a man sharpneth the countenance of his Friend,</HI> Prov. 27.9, I7.</P>
<P>But if the more Accomplished, mind no∣thing but Earthly things, the Simple are in great danger of erring in their Spiritual Con∣verses, and Degenerating with them.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Neglecting the Rising Generation has no little tendency towards the Ruine of a People.</HI> If
<PB N="19" REF="002123_0021_0FBC1FCBA7070EF0"/>
their Government and Education in Families, and their Spiritual Nourishment in Churches, be for the most part neglected; what may be expected, but <HI>an Increase of Sinful Men?</HI></P>
<P>And here I might add, that of Mens Living so Remote, from Places of Publick Worship and Education. For altho' it seems Una∣voidable as to many; yet it has a fatal ten∣dency: For not a few are ready to make use of such an Inconveniency, if not as an Argu∣ment to Justify, yet as an Excuse for the Ig∣norance &amp; Irreligiousness of themselves and theirs. And indeed Ignorance, Rudeness, &amp; Prophaneness reigns among many such. In not a few such Unhappy Families, is found a sad Neglect of the Soul; and a readiness to Embrace any Vanity or Iniquity, to which their Hearts Incline them and Satan Tempts them. It would Grieve ones Soul to see a Numerous and Plentiful Increase, of reasona∣ble Creatures Scattered up and down the Wilderness, as Sheep, having no Shepherd.</P>
<P>The IMPROVEMENT of this Truth may be in Three Words;</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> By way of Instruction.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> By way of Reflection.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> By way of Exhortation.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="20" REF="002123_0022_0FBC1FCD497B8168"/>I. <HI>By way of INSTRUCTION, in a few Inferences.</HI></P>
<P>And</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Hence there is just Grounds to fear that it will not be long before such a People will be really Dead.</HI> How long it shall be precisely, or whe∣ther it shall be so or not God only knows; for God can Work and none can hinder; he can recover them that are deadly Wounded; the Effusion of his Holy Spirit, would soon alter the face of all things; GOD can <HI>Fill the Valleys,</HI> and bring every <HI>Mountain and Hill Low</HI>; he can <HI>make the Crooked Strait,</HI> and the <HI>Rough way Smooth, Luk.</HI> 3.5. Yet according to the nature and manner, of most things under the Sun, that which is Languishing, &amp; ready to Vanish away seldom Revives. Particular persons indeed have been under manifest Decays, yet have been Restored: But when they have been Apparently under the Symptoms of Death, have seldom Liv'd long. Applicable to this is that Objection which Israel seem'd to offer against themselves, <HI>If our Transgres∣sions, and our Sins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then Live?</HI> Ezek 33.I0, And here we may say concerning a People, that have been, &amp; yet are, under Advantages to recover themselves, that in case Death rides
<PB N="21" REF="002123_0023_0FBC1FCEB5252DC8"/>
upon <HI>the Pale Horse,</HI> 'tis to be expected that <HI>Hell will follow after.</HI> And that the less Privi∣leged part of Mankind, yea Hell it self will be moved and say, <HI>Art thou also became weak as we, art thou become like unto us</HI>?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>'Tis a Miserable Life that such a People Live.</HI> Indeed there be some who altho' they dread those malignant and acute Diseases, to which the Body is Incident; and are Intolera∣ble restless when under them: Yet can be Pa∣tient, Easy, yea Chearful, under those of a more Terrible Nature and Tendency. Now altho' it be thus, a Peoples Sinful, and Dis∣composed Circumstances, are a Provocation to God to Blast their Endeavours, to reduce them to great Straits, to deny his Blessing to the means which they Injoy, for their Natural, and Spiritual Comfort. By these they are also Exposed to great Shame and Disgrace, as also to be Devoured one of another.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That such a People, are but an Unnatural, and sadly Mistaking People, if they do not be bestir themselves.</HI> The very Brute Creatures, have their various ways by which they express a certain Impulse, when any Evil or Danger is before them. And as they are very quick∣sighted in discerning their Danger, so are they no less Active, and Industrious, to secure themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="002123_0024_0FBC1FD068184C28"/>And as for men there be but few whose Self-preserving Principles are so Stupifyed, Weakned, and Lost, but will Seasonably, Voluntarily, and Expensively lay out them∣selves, for the preventing or removing, those Evils especially which apparently Threaten their Natural Life. And what Satan said with respect to <HI>Job</HI> is doubtless true in the general, <HI>Skin for Skin, yea all that a man hath, will he give for his Life,</HI> Job 24. How then doth this upbraid mens Negligence, in those things that greatly concern the Comfort of their Natural Life; as also that state of theirs, which is to be Immutable, &amp; Everlasting?</P>
<P>It looks as if the Apostasy had so Inverted the order of Humane Nature, and Reason, that great things seem Indifferent; and that which is Sinful, or of no great Moment, as the <HI>Magnum Op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtet,</HI> in no case to be Neglected. But since the Gospel is so suitable to Convince Mens Judgments, to Excite their Affections &amp; Inclinations; or in a Word to recover them from their Blindness, Stupidity &amp; Prejudice, a People are Inexcusably Unnatural, it it may be said of them with Reference to their Sinful Condition, in the Words of the Prophet, <HI>Isa.</HI> 42. ult. <HI>And it hath set him on Fire round about, yet he knew not; it burned him, yet he laid it not to Heart.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="23" REF="002123_0025_0FBC1FD19FE63E98"/>4. '<HI>Tis a very Melancholly Prospect, to see such a People Aggravating their Disease and Hastening their own Death.</HI> It would fill one with Hor∣ror <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> see a Man offering Violence against his own Life. It was a sad sight to behold the man possessed with Devils among the Tombs, <HI>crying and cutting himself with Stones.</HI> But its more surprising to see a People (under many Advantages to help themselves) not only dy∣ing to all that is good, but <HI>living to all that is Evil.</HI></P>
<P>For a People to work against that little life which remains among them, as 'tis otherwise amazing, so particularly in regard that it re∣flects on GOD, as if He had made them desti∣tute of the Principles of Self-preservation; as if God had beautify'd &amp; compleated only the grosser part of the man, and left the Soul (which is the very Essence of the man) half∣formed, uncapable of acting in a proper man∣ner, fixing on suitable Objects, proposing right ends in the various actions of Life: or rather as if the Soul were made like a Kingdom di∣vided against it self. But furely <HI>GOD made man upright,</HI> Eccl. 7. <HI>ult.</HI> and 'tis Man himself that hath <HI>sought out many inventions.</HI> Man was made <HI>a little lower than the Angels,</HI> and <HI>crowned with glory &amp; honour,</HI> Psal. 8.5. GOD hath given us good assurance that <HI>He takes no pleasure in the
<PB N="24" REF="002123_0026_0FBC1FD393FCAF18"/>
death of him that dieth,</HI> Ezek. I6. <HI>ult.</HI> Tis there∣fore a fearful thing, for men to say when they are tempted to destroy themselves, that <HI>they are tempted of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>II. By way of REFLECTION.</P>
<P>It becomes us to consider whether this be our Case; that if so, we may think Soberly, and Meanly of ourselves: Yea that we may remember and be Confounded, &amp; never open our Mouths because of our Shame.</P>
<P>Now it may be there are many forts as well as great numbers among us, that are not only Dying themselves, but their Diseases being Infectious, are pernicious to others.</P>
<P>I shall make a few Reflections on some of them. For as much as those that do most at Ruining themselves, and those among whom they dwell, do least at Reflecting on them∣selves for it. And,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>The Negligent.</HI> Some there be, that are it may be grosly Negligent, in, and of their Families; Neglectful of the Government, and Education of their Children; bring them up indeed, but not in the <HI>Nurture and Admonition of the Lord,</HI> Pray not at all among them, or for them; or if they do, 'tis but rarely, and as faintly. Fury belongs to them that call
<PB N="25" REF="002123_0027_0FBC1FD49FEA78A0"/>
not on the Name of God, for such do not a little towards, <HI>Devouring Jacob &amp; laying his Ha∣bitation Desolate, Jer.</HI> I0. ult. Many of these 'tis like would gladly be look't upon as very Devout in their Closets, but it seems to be no great breach of Charity, to Conclude, that such as are Heathens in their Families, are not very good Christians in their Closets. It sounds like a Contradiction, that Men should have a tender Regard to their own Souls, and none to the Souls of those that are about 'em.</P>
<P>Some plead they want <HI>an Institution for Fami∣ly Prayer.</HI> Very like, such were never at a loss about the <HI>Institution,</HI> before they had lost <HI>the Inclination.</HI> And if they could regain the Dis∣position, they would soon furnish themselves with Arguments both Rational, &amp; Scriptural, to justify such a Practice. I suppose this is a point most Disputed, when and where Iniqui∣ty does abound, and the Love of many is grown Cold.</P>
<P>Again, Those that Neglect the <HI>Publick Wor∣ship &amp; Ordinances of God.</HI> Not only the Holy Sacraments are practically Despised; but the Ordinary Worship of God. The House of God is Unfrequented by them. They are far from the Psalmists spirit, who accounted <HI>a day in Gods Courts better than a thousand, Psal.</HI> 84. I0. But these will easily be detained. Some pre∣tend
<PB N="26" REF="002123_0028_0FBC1FD9CEF193A8"/>
Works of Necessity &amp; Mercy, or Bodily Indisposition (more seigned than true) some Difficulty in the season, and such like: But the bottom of all is the want of an Heart to the Duty.</P>
<P>'Tis Probable there be those that have little Heart to attend on the stated Worship of God, who chearfully wait on some other Publick Solemnity's and as probable that their design is Earthly and Sensual, that 'tis more for their Recreation than their Edification; for the Gratification of their Lusts, rather than the salvation of their Souls. Most likely, they aim at what God solemnly forbids, viz. <HI>Rioting and Drunkinness, Chambering &amp; Wantonness</HI>— And instead of putting on the Lord Jesus Christ, they intend to make <HI>Provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof, Rom,</HI> I2, I3, I4.</P>
<P>Moreover such as Neglect <HI>their Callings,</HI> Work not at all, or but very little: whose Hands refuse to Labour. These set ill Ex∣amples, are Chargeable and Burdensom; are making U proars, &amp; carriying on Factions in the places where they Live; whilst the Honest La∣bourers, are Sweating &amp; Toiling to Maintain them: for by that time the Labourers have gathered in their Increase, these wanderers have devised some Unjustifiable methods, to make a considerable part of it their own.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="27" REF="002123_0029_0FBC1FDAD2E2DE90"/>2. <HI>Men of Unsavoury Language.</HI> Yea, yea; and Nay, nay; is as easy to Pronounce, as the Prophane Stuff, the Vain Jests, &amp; Horrid Oaths, now in Credit with many. The Apostle <HI>James</HI> sets forth this Mischievous, Inconsist∣ent Folly, to the Life, telling us that the <HI>Tongue is a fire, a world of Iniquity,</HI> that it <HI>sets on fire the course of nature; and is set on fire of Hell.</HI> That <HI>therewith men Bless God &amp; Curse men, which are made after the Similitude of God. Jam.</HI> 3.6, 9. If such did seriously consider the Evil which they bring upon themselves; how hurtful they are to their fellow Creatures; what confusions, &amp; quarrels they are the Authors of, by such Com∣munications; and what an Account Men will have to give at last for every Idle Word. 'Twould lay them under some Restraint.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Excessive Drinkers.</HI> Indeed every Crea∣ture of God is good; strong Drinks are so; and would be a considerable Support to the natural Spirits, Revive humane Nature, make Men more fit for Service, were they Improved in due season, manner &amp; measure. The Psal∣mist tells us that <HI>Wine maketh glad the Heart of man,</HI> Psal. I04. I5. But the Immoderate use of these things, is exceeding Hurtful: Multi∣tudes to their cost have found it so. This is a Sin which is but seldom Repented of, or For∣saken, till 'tis too late: until Nature is so weakened
<PB N="28" REF="002123_0030_0FBC1FDC55D055D8"/>
weakened and disordered; that it cannot per∣form its several Offices: And the Body cannot by any means, or Medicines, be Reduced to a good state; but must return to its Dust after much Languishing &amp; Misery. And as for the Souls of such, 'tis most likely they are going to that Wrath, which they have Treasured up, thro' much Impenitency, &amp; hardness of Heart.</P>
<P>By <HI>Intemperate Drinking,</HI> much time is wast∣ed, estates diminished, and so the Drinkers, &amp; their Families Impoverished; their Names are ruined, their Stomachs overcharged, their Brains over heated, &amp; their Consciences fear∣ed. This makes the Diligent Sluggish; the Frugal Prodigal; the Wise Simple; the Modest Impudent, and Loathsome, both in Words and Actions: Would to God such would be Ad∣vised by <HI>Solomon, &amp; not took upon the Wine, when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, and moveth it self aright</HI>: For he assures them, that afterwards <HI>it biteth like a serpent, &amp; stingeth like an adder.</HI> Prov. 23.2I, 32. Such often experi∣ence the Truth, of what he Asserts; but can∣not be perswaded to embrace his Counsel.</P>
<P><HI>Taverns</HI> are too often the places of ungodly mens Extravagancy's; the Chambers where mischief and vanity walk in Triumph: here men of all Ranks and Professions, are made <HI>the Song of Drunkards</HI>; here strises, debates, whis∣perings,
<PB N="29" REF="002123_0031_0FBC1FDE0E57A180"/>
swellings and tumults, are Cherished; here men <HI>cast fire-brands, arrow, &amp; death, and then say that they are in sport.</HI></P>
<P>And I might here say, that when &amp; where it so happens, that men of loose Principles, greedy of filthy lucre, left to their Liberty; men whose subsistance depends upon this manner of living are the Masters of such Houses; they that will be filthy, may be so: for they shall have opportunity to gratify their Lusts, and Friends to cover the multitude of their Abominations.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Such as Revile, or Speak Evil of Rulers.</HI> We are bound, not to speak evil of any man; and then certainly not of Rulers. To revile any is a Sin, because it is a Transgression of Gods Command: but its greatned &amp; aggravated, when directed against Superiors. Such as speak evil of the things that they understand not, cannot be innocent, or excusable, since the Apostle sets them forth, by <HI>natural brute beasts, made to be taken &amp; destroyed</HI>; 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.I2. Such a Sin must be great, which strikes at the power of those that Govern; and the peace of them that are Governed.</P>
<P>Complainers &amp; Revilers always make some fair colours and pretences for what they say against Rulers. And it is no new thing, for men to think themselves right in their own
<PB N="30" REF="002123_0032_0FBC1FDF2B3806A0"/>
cause, altho' the whole proceeding be really a very wrong thing. <HI>Korah</HI> and his Company, boldly told <HI>Moses &amp; Aaron,</HI> that they took too much upon them: But God soon Con∣vinced them of their error &amp; folly in a terrible manner.</P>
<P>If Rulers really do amiss; (as there is none Absolutely Perfectly &amp; Invariably Good but GOD) it better becomes men to Pray for them, than Prate against them.</P>
<P>Now altho' we are to treat Rulers with great Deference, &amp; intreat them as Fathers; yet good Rulers will Bear to be Humbly and Modestly put in mind of their failings &amp; mis∣takes: yea will doubtless say with <HI>David, let the righteous smite me, it shall be a kindness; and Let him reprove me, it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head, Psal.</HI> I4I.5.</P>
<P>But to Curse &amp; Revile is the way of an in∣constant, head-strong, stiff-necked, &amp; haughty Generation. <HI>John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, he hath a Devil: The Son of Man, came eating and drinking, and they say, behold a gluttonous man, and a wine bibber, a friend of publicans &amp; sinners, Mat</HI> II.I8, I9. And such kind of treatment as this, may Civil Ru∣lers, (as well as JESUS and his Messenger) expect, (&amp; the more faithful the more curses) from such as cannot bear to be Reformed nor
<PB N="31" REF="002123_0033_0FBC1FE0A0607B90"/>
Governed. Such men would be thought to have a very great affection, for the Publick Weal, I suppose this to be a very indirect way to promote it. May not such Revilings ra∣ther be thought to be the effects of Pride, Pre∣judice, Envy, Emulation, and such like?</P>
<P>If any such Covet the Honour of being Rulers; they may do Wisely to consider, the Burden as well as the Honour of Government: And what an Emperor once said when he Ob∣served people to gaze on his Purple Robe and Golden Crown, <HI>Did you know what Cares are under them, you would not take them from the Ground to have them.</HI></P>
<P>If Honour be the thing that such aim at, they should therewith remember, that they would take but little Pleasure in it, if others should at this rate attempt to practise upon them: Yea a Vain-glorious Spirit, can scarcely bear the least Affront. <HI>Haman</HI> declared, that <HI>the glory of his Riches,</HI> the <HI>multitude of his Chil∣dren; and the singular respect the King and Queen had shewed him,</HI> (having honoured him above the rest of the Princes) <HI>Availed him nothing. Ester</HI> 5.II, I2, I3. And that which filled him with discontent &amp; rage was, that <HI>Mordecai refused to rise up or move for him.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="32" REF="002123_0034_0FBC1FE21FFED778"/>III. By way of EXHORTATION.</P>
<P>If this Truth be Applicable to us, then this Word may be Directed</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>To all such as have, or shall this Day be called to take the Civil</HI> (and therewith not a little of the Religious) <HI>Concerns of this People under their Care and Management.</HI></P>
<P>Let all such be humbly Intreated to be of one Heart, in endeavouring to be to this Peo∣ple, <HI>as the Rain upon the mowen Grafts: as showers that water the Earth.</HI> Such must needs Pity us; for as our Sins are upon us, so the Hand of GOD is often touching us.</P>
<P>I may at this time offer a few Words, more especially to the Honourable GOVERNOUR, and DEPUTY-<HI>Governour,</HI> with the <HI>Worshipful</HI> ASSISTANTS.</P>
<P>You will give me leave (<HI>Honourable &amp; Wor∣shipful</HI>) Humbly and Submissively to Beseech You <HI>to do what may be done for this languishing People that are round about you.</HI> You have for some time observed us to be <HI>ready to Die</HI>; but as yet we are not <HI>quite Dead.</HI></P>
<P>What I would here say, is only to <HI>stir up your pure minds, by way of remembrance.</HI></P>
<P>And then, That something extraordinary is expected from Civil Rulers. Such are here∣unto
<PB N="33" REF="002123_0035_0FBC1FE39D00AEC0"/>
unto Appointed by God, &amp; designed by Men; to do something more than others. And as they are laid under singular Obligations, so have they some special Opportunities of Im∣proving their Talents, for the good of a great many. Those to whom much is Given and Committed, of them <HI>GOD will require,</HI> and <HI>men will expect the more.</HI> GOD expects you should be, <HI>Good men</HI> Pray that you may be, and only <HI>ungodly men</HI> desire &amp; endeavour that you may not be, <HI>the Glory and Stability of our Times.</HI></P>
<P>There be many that can do little more than Pray for us; and those that are Persons of considerable Abilities, are obliged to restrain the Improvement of them, within the bounda∣ries of their several Stations: And that which might be very Disorderly, and sinful in some others to do or attempt, may be a great Duty &amp; vertue in Rulers. <HI>GOD is a God of Order,</HI> not of <HI>Confusion</HI>: And as in a Natural Body, so in a Civil, there be indeed <HI>many Members</HI>; yet all have not the same, but their <HI>several Offices.</HI> So that altho' the design of an action be good, yet if in the doing of it men break their Ranks, and step out of their Places, God will not be well Pleased with them. Now God hath put into the hands of Civil Rulers, the Reins of Government and the Sword of
<PB N="34" REF="002123_0036_0FBC1FE52423CCF0"/>
Judgment, that they might be able to restrain and subdue those hardy Sinners, that will not be reduced by Counsel, Perswasion, or Ex∣ample.</P>
<P>Again; Altho' it may be very discouraging in it self, to be Concerned with a People of a froward spirit; yet the more troublesom we are grown, the more need have we of your Zeal and united Endeavours for our Amend∣ment.</P>
<P>If Rulers at such a time should slacken their Hands, good Men in some pang of Zeal, might be apt to step out of their Places: And as for the Wicked, they want nothing but an oppor∣tunity to thrust themselves into other mens Offices; and put all things into Confusion. <HI>Absalom</HI> perswaded the people, that there was no man deputed to hear them: and then adds, <HI>Oh that I were made a judge in the land, that every man that hath any suit or cause, would come to me, and I would do him justice,</HI> 2 Sam. I5.4. And his Project with a <HI>few Kisses,</HI> took with the People, and thus he stole away their Hearts: But a terrible Convulsion, Distraction and Slaughter soon followed.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Korah</HI> rebellion, <HI>Moses</HI> does not sink under discouragement; nor say as a little be∣fore, Numb. II.I4. <HI>I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.</HI> But
<PB N="35" REF="002123_0037_0FBC1FE75D1D9918"/>
bestirs himself, and puts on the Courage and Zeal that became him; and GOD wrought with him, and for him; for His own Glory, and <HI>Israels</HI> Safety &amp; quiet, in the Conviction of the Congregation, and in the Destruction of those Sinners against their own Souls.</P>
<P>And further; It is to be Acknowledged, that you have done many worthy deeds a∣mong us, and for us. And altho' there may be ungrateful and ungovernable Spirits among us; yet 'tis to be hoped that there remains very significant numbers, that will heartily Submit to your Government, and strengthen your Hands, in all your further endeavours for our good.</P>
<P>Moreover; If you should recover us, you would have a double portion of the Glory and Comfort of such a happy Revolution: You shall spend the remains of your days in quiet; after you have seen what I doubt not you pre∣fer above <HI>your chief Joy.</HI> You shall be highly Esteemed; and men every where, shall Bless God that hath made you the healers of our breaches; yea you shall (by way of Eminency) be had in everlasting Remembrance.</P>
<P>Also; I may say, we are a People, many of whose Fathers, were some of <HI>the best of Men.</HI> Men of excellent Spirits. We may in a good sense, be said to be <HI>Children of the stock of Abra∣ham</HI>:
<PB N="36" REF="002123_0038_0FBC1FEC831ED400"/>
Children of the Prophets, and of the Covenant which God made with our Fathers. <HI>Act.</HI> 3.25. Were we the Children of <HI>base men,</HI> yet it would grieve you to see us pine away in our Iniquities: And much more since we are not only Gods Covenant People; but such for whom, <HI>our Fathers have laid up a liberal stock of Prayers.</HI></P>
<P>And may I here add; That when you shall arrive at the pleasant Land, those of our Fa∣thers that are gone before, shall Embrace you, with exceeding Joy &amp; Thankfulness for your Care &amp; Kindness, to their Perishing Progeny.</P>
<P>Finally; So often as your Inferiours stand before you at the Bar; are you put in mind of the great, and Notable Day: when you shall be plentifully rewarded, for all the good, you have done, or may do, for us. What you give to this People shall be given you again; good measure, pressed down and shaken together; yea running over. I trust you will be able to say at last with <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> Isa. 38.3. <HI>Remember now, O Lord, I beseech thee, how I have walked be∣fore thee, in truth, &amp; with a perfect heart, &amp; have done that which is good in thy sight.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>To Gospel</HI>-MINISTERS.</P>
<P>Both God and Men expect, that the Zeal, Wisdom and Faithfulness of this venerable
<PB N="37" REF="002123_0039_0FBC1FED5D865980"/>
Order of men, should be somewhat Excelling. Such are called the <HI>Salt of the Earth, &amp; Light of the World.</HI> And as they <HI>represent CHRIST,</HI> so its expected that they should <HI>imitate him,</HI> and cleave closer to him, (especially in a De∣clining time) than is expected from some o∣thers. CHRIST was Industrious, Zealous, Holy, Harmless, and Undefiled; and spent His whole time and life, for the destroying Satans Kingdom, &amp; advancing the Kingdom of God in the World: All his Ministers should, and all good Ministers will labour to be, &amp; do so. Much is expected from those that <HI>Profess Christ</HI>; but more from such as <HI>Personate Him.</HI> It was a very solemn Question our SAVIOUR put to the Apostles, <HI>Will ye also go away</HI>? Joh. 6.67. Which shews that if all others should Apostatize &amp; forsake him, yet he expects that his <HI>Ministers</HI> should stand by him. Its left upon Record for an everlasting Praise to the <HI>Apostles,</HI> that they continued with CHRIST in his <HI>Temptations,</HI> Luk. 22.28.</P>
<P>Again; The work of such men is a work of the greatest Weight and Moment: They are properly &amp; nextly Concerned about the <HI>Souls of Men,</HI> and their <HI>Eternal Salvation.</HI> If a man lose his Life thro' the neglect of him that hath the charge of it, yet 'tis possible his Soul may be Saved; or if he lose his Estate in like man∣ner;
<PB N="38" REF="002123_0040_0FBC1FEEE411DF18"/>
yet 'tis possible he may recover himself, and gain another as good or better: But if the Soul be lost the man is gone forever. All the treasures in the World cannot make up this Loss. <HI>It's not thousands of Rams,</HI> or <HI>ten thousands of rivers of Oil that can redeem him,</HI> Mic. 6.7. Therefore they that have the charge of Souls, have a concern of Infinite Worth.</P>
<P>Again; Such by reason of the Nature of their work, are advantaged to be some of the most Spiritual men in the world. Their work is properly Spiritual: they are necessarily, principally, and in a manner intirely, taken up about such things, as nextly concern, the Kingdom of Christ, and the Eternal State of men, <HI>They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they shall put incense before thee, &amp; whole burnt-sacrifice upon thine altar,</HI> Deut. 33 I0 Such are under singular Advantages to know the Will of God; to be Confirmed &amp; Esta∣blished in the great Doctrines of the Gospel: to know the Greatness &amp; Cer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ainty of mans Misery by the First, and of his Felicity and Blessedness by the Second <HI>Adam.</HI> And Christ seems to have put so much of his Spirit and Power upon Ministers, as gives them some peculiar advantages of influence upon the Children of men.</P>
<P>It being thus, its expected that Ministers be
<PB N="39" REF="002123_0041_0FBC1FF05FBF26C8"/>
men, frequent &amp; mighty <HI>in Prayer</HI> especially when men are generally going off from God, It is very observable, how the Spirit of Sup∣plication rested on <HI>Elijah</HI>; for his heart being hot within him, and his Soul grieved on the madness &amp; misery of Israel he Pray<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d &amp; said, <HI>Lord God of Abraham, of Isaac &amp; of Israel let it be known this day, that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word, Hear me, O Lord hear me, that this people may know that thou art the Lord God; and that thou hast turned their heart back a∣gain,</HI> I King. I8 36, 37 Now in such solemn &amp; servent Addresses to GOD, Ministers may expect the Concurrence of all that are fearers of God, that have a genuine Love to man∣kind that have not bowed the Knee to the Idols of this Generation; that have been look∣ing &amp; longing for the Returns of God's Holy Spirit upon a People, that are almost Re∣volted and Gone.</P>
<P>But if <HI>Israel be not Gathered</HI>; if the <HI>Founders melt in vain</HI>; if the <HI>Fig-tree do not blossom</HI>; if there <HI>be no fruit in the vine,</HI> and <HI>the labour of the Olive fail</HI>; yet will it be exceeding Comforta∣ble for such to be able to say at <HI>Christ's appear∣ing &amp; Kingdom</HI> (as good Stewards of the ma∣nifold Grace of GOD) according to their measure, with the <HI>Psalmist</HI>; Psal. 40.9 <HI>I have

Preached Righteousness in the great Congregation. I have not refrained my lips, O Lord, thou knowest.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>To the Whole</HI> CONGREGATlON.</P>
<P>Let us all be prevail<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with to do our true Endeavour, &amp; take Pains with our Selves Fa∣milies, &amp; one with another, according to our several Abilities Conditions &amp; Obligations; that we maybe <HI>a living People,</HI> as well as have <HI>a Name to live</HI> that we may <HI>not be dead while we live.</HI> Were all that are here present before the Lord, <HI>dead to sin</HI> and <HI>alive unto God,</HI> it may be we should more generally (in a little time) <HI>revive as the Corn,</HI> and <HI>grow as the Vine.</HI></P>
<P>As for those that have been the great In∣struments of Wounding &amp; Weakning us, and will still do wickedly, come on it what will; they should remember, That if GOD should give Us <HI>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Cup</HI> that may yet be in His Hand (altho' many may be ready to promise them∣selves tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the bitterness of Death is pass'd) <HI>such shall wring out the dregs of it &amp; drink them,</HI> Psal. 75.8. As they <HI>loved Cursing</HI> so it shall <HI>come upon them,</HI> as <HI>Oil into their bones</HI>; and as they delighted not <HI>in a Blessing,</HI> so it shall <HI>be far from them.</HI></P>
<P>O let us not be so Ung<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ateful to GOD, so Unkind &amp; Unnatural to our Serves &amp; to our Children, as to perpetuate our Apostasy: <HI>Hu∣manum

est Peccave, Diabolicum Perseverare, et Angelicum resurgere.</HI> We shall be very inex∣cusable and unpardonable, if it may be said after all that God hath done with us &amp; for us; <HI>That GOD called, and we refused; the god of this world called, and we attended</HI>: That neither the Hopes of Salvation, nor the Fears of Destru∣ction were strong enough to call us back, <HI>from darkness unto light</HI>; and <HI>from the power of Satan unto God.</HI></P>
<P>To close all: Would to God there were so much Life in us, as was in <HI>Ephraim,</HI> when he bemoaned himself thus, <HI>Thou hast Chastised me &amp; I was Chastised; as a Bullock unaccustomed to the Yoke: Turn thou me &amp; I shall be turned; for thou art the Lord my God,</HI> Jer. 3I.I8. For then might we expect the like Comfortable returns of Divine Compassion: <HI>For since I spake against him I do earnestly remember him still; therefore my Bowels are troubled for him,</HI> Ver. 20. And that this Speech would be again used among us; <HI>The LORD Bless thee, 0 Habitation of Justice, &amp; Mountain of Holiness.</HI> Oh! That it might Please GOD to say concerning us, <HI>I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their GOD, and they shall be My People.</HI></P>
