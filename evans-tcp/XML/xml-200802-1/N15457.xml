<HEAD>The Life and Confession of JOHNSON GREEN, Who is to be Executed this Day, August 17th, 1786, for the Atrocious Crime of BURGLARY; Together with his LAST and DYING WORDS.</HEAD>
<P>I <HI>JOHNSON GREEN,</HI> having brought myself to a shameful and ignominious death, by my wicked conduct, and as I am a dying man I leave to the world the fol∣lowing History of my Birth, Education, and vicious Practices, hoping that all people will take warning by my evil example, and shun vice and follow virtue.</P>
<P>I was born at Bridgwater, in the Country of Plymouth, in the Commonwealth of Massa∣chusetts, was twenty-nine years of age the se∣venth day of February last. My father was a negro, and a servant to the Hon. Timothy Ed∣son <ABBR>Esq;</ABBR> late of said Bridgwater, deceased. My mother was an Irish woman, named Sarah Johnson, she was a widow, and her maiden name was Green. I have been called Joseph-Johnson Green. When I was five years of age my mother bound me as an Apprentice to Mr. Seth Howard of said Bridgwater, to be instructed in Agriculture. I was used very tenderly, and instructed in the principles of the Christian Religion. Whilst I was an ap∣prentice my mother gave me much good ad∣vice cautioned me against keeping company with those that used bad language and other vicious practices, She advised me not to go to sea nor into the army, foretold what has come to pass since the commencement of the late war, and said it would not come to pass in her day. She died about sixteen years ago, and if I had followed her good advice I might have escaped an ignominious death.</P>
<P>When I was eighteen years of age (contrary to my mother's advice) I inlisted into the A∣merican service, and remained in the same for the duration of the war. I would just observe to the world, that my being addicted to drun∣kenness, the keeping of bad company, and a correspondence that I have had with lewd wo∣men, has been the cause of my being brought to this wretched situation.</P>
<P>In March, 1781, I was married at F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stown, to one Sarah Phillips, a mus<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, who was brought up by Mr. Olney, of Providence. She has had two children since I was married to her, and I have treated her exceeding ill.</P>
<P>When I began to steal I was about 12 years old, at which time I stole four cakes of gin∣gerbread and six biscuit, out of a horse cart, and afterwards I stole sundry small articles, and was not detected.</P>
<P>When I was about fourteen, I stole one do∣zen of lemons and one cake of chocolate, was detected, and received reproof. Soon after I stole some hens, and my conduct was so bad that my master sold me to one of his cousins, who used me well.</P>
<P>I continued the practice of stealing, and just before I went into the army I took my master's key, unlocked his chest, and stole two shillings; he discovered what I had done, gave me cor∣rection, but not so severely as I deserved.</P>
<P>Sometime after I was engaged in the Ame∣rican service, at a certain tavern in Sherburne, I stole fifteen shillings, one case bottle of rum, one dozen of biscuit, and a pillow case with some sugar.</P>
<P>In April, 1731, I stole at the Highlands, near West-Point, a pair of silver shoe buckles, was d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>cted, and received one hundred lashes.</P>
<P>In October, the same year, when I was at West-Point and we were extremely pinched for the want of provisions, three of us broke open a settler's markee, stole three cheeses, one small firkin of butter, and some chocolate. I only was detected, and punished by receiving one hundred stripes.</P>
<P>Sometime in the winter of 178<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, at Easton, I broke into a grist mill, belonging to Mr. Timothy Randall, and stole about a bushel of corn, and at sundry times the same year I broke into a cellar belonging to Mr. Ebenezer How∣ard, of the same place, and stole some meat and tobacco; and I also broke into a cellar and a corn house belonging to Mr. Abiel Kinsley, of the same place, and stole some meat and corn; and at hast-Bridgewater, the same year, I broke open a grist mill, and stole near a bushel of meal; and at same time stole three of four dozen herrings our of a corn house. I also went to a corn house belonging to Mr. Nathaniel Whitman, of Bridgwater, and stole two cheeses out of it.</P>
<P>August Ist, 1784, I broke open a house in Providence, and stole goods to the value of forty dollars. Soon after I broke open a shop near Patuxet Falls, stole one pair of cards, two cod fish, and sundry other articles.</P>
<P>In 1784 I also committed the following crimes, viz. I broke into a cellar about a mile from Patuxet Bridge, stole about thirty weight of salt pork, one case bottle, and several other articles. About the same time I stole out of a washing tub in Patuxet, a pair of trowsers, three pair of stocking, and a shirt; and at Seaconk I stole two shirts and some stockings through an open window. I stole at a barn between Seaconk and Attleborough, a woollen blanket, and through an open window near the same place, I stole two sheets, one gown, and one shirt. At Mr. Amos Shepherdson's in Attle∣borough, I stole out of wash-tub, one shirt, two shirts, one short gown, and one pair of stockings.</P>
<P>At Norton, I broke into a cellar belonging to Col. George Leonard, and stole a quarter of mutton. The same night I broke into another cellar near that place, and stole between twen∣ty and thirty weight of salt pork.</P>
<P>About the same time, I broke onto tavern near the same place, and stole near two dollars in money, and one case-bottle of rum.</P>
<P>Between Providence and Attleborough, I broke open two cellars, and stole some meat.</P>
<P>I broke into a house in Johnson, and stole betwixt twenty and thirty wt. of salt pork and beef, and one broom.</P>
<P>Some of the things I stole this year, I sold at the market in Providence.</P>
<P>April 23d. 1785. I was imprisoned at Nan∣tucket, for striking a truckman, and some o∣ther persons, at a time when I was intoxicated with liquor: The next day I was released upon my paying a fine and the cost of prosecution.</P>
<P>I broke open a house in Stoughton, stole sev∣eral aprons, some handkerchiefs, and some o∣ther apparel.</P>
<P>I stole about two yards and an half of tow cloth from Col. David Lathrop, of Bridgewa∣ter; and the same night I stole a shirt from a clothier, in the same town; and I also stole one apron, one pocket-handkerchief, one pair of stockings, and one shift from Thomas Howard, of East-Bridgewater, upon the same night.</P>
<P>The next week I stole a piece of tow-cloth, in Halifax, and at the same time I broke into a house, and stole about twenty pounds of salt beef, and three pounds of wool.</P>
<P>October 15th, 1785, I broke open a shop in Walpole, and stole seven pair of shoes.</P>
<P>Nov. 1785. I broke open a store in Natick, and stole a quantity of goods from the owner, viz. Mr. Morris.</P>
<P>At Capt. Bent's tavern, in Stoughtonham, I went down chimney, by a rope, opened a window and fastened it up with my jack-knife; immediately after, a man came to the house for a gallon of rum; he called to the landlord, and his daughter (as I took her to be) arose and waited upon him. She discovered the open window, with the jack-knife, and said it did not belong to the house; it was concluded that it belonged to some boys who were gone to a husking, and had called there that evening.—It was my design to have made my escape out at the window, when I opened it, in case I should be discovered by any person in the house: But when the man came up to the house, I fearing I might be discovered, drawed myself up chim∣ney and stood on the cross-bar until he was gone and all the people were asleep; I then descended again, and stole near three dollars out of the bar; then ascended the chimney and escaped without being discovered.</P>
<P>The same month I hid a quantity of goods which I had stole (part of them being the goods I had stolen at Natick) in a barn, belonging to Mr. Nathaniel Foster, in Middle∣borough, and I engaged to come and work for the said Foster It happened that I was taken upon suspicion that I had stolen a horse (which I had taken and rode about four miles) and committed to gaol in the county of Ply∣mouth, but as no sufficient evidence appeared, I was set at liberty. In the mean time the said Foster found the goods and advertised them. I sent my wife to him, she owned and received the goods, and I escaped undiscovered, by her telling him that I came to his house in the even∣ing preceding the day I had gromised to work for him; that as it was late in the night, and the weather rainy, I did not choose to disturb him and his family, by calling them up; that I was obliged to leave the goods and return home, and being taken up on the suspicion a∣foresaid, I could not take care of the goods &amp;c.</P>
<P>April 1st, 1786, I broke into a house, in Medford, and stole two pair of stockings, one scarf, one gown, and one pair of buckles.</P>
<P>The same month I broke into the house of one Mr. Blake, innholder, opposite the bar∣racks in Rutland, and stole a bottle of bitters, and three or four dollars in money.</P>
<P>Soon after I broke into Mr. Chickery's house, in Holden, and stole about thirty dol∣lars worth of clothing. The next day I lodg∣ed in the woods, and at evening Mr. Chickery took me up after I had got into the high-way, searched my pack, and found his things. On his attempting to seize me, I ran off, and made my escape.—I left my pack, and the money I had stolen from Mr. Blake.</P>
<P>Not long after, I went to Mr. Jotham Howe's in Shrewsbury, and opened a window, and stole a blanket.</P>
<P>I then went to another house, broke in, and stole a fine apron out of a desk. The same night I went to a barn belonging to Mr. Baldwin, in said Shrewsbury, and lodged in it the next day, and at evening I broke into his house, and stole about three shillings and three pence in money, and about nine dollars worth of clothing, for which crime I am now under sentence of death.</P>
<P>The same night I broke open the house of Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>or, In said Shrewsbury, and stole i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> money and goods, to the value of near six dollars.</P>
<P>I also broke into the house of Mr. Ross Wyman, of the same town, and upon the same night, and stole from him near two dollars.</P>
<P>Moreover, I stole a pair of thread stockings at a house just beyond said Wyman's, and hid myself in the woods, where I lay all the next day, and at evening I sat off towards Bos∣ton, and was taken up by a guard that was placed by a bridge in the edge of Westborough. I was taken before General Ward, confesesed the crimes alledged, was committed to gaol, and in April last, I received sentence of death, for the crime aforementioned.</P>
<P>Upon the evening of the first day of June, I cleared myself of all my chains, and made an escape from the gaol; And notwithstanding all the admonitions, counsels and warnings that I had received from the good ministers and other pious persons who had visited me under my confinement, I returned again to my vicious practices, "like the dog to his vomit, and the sow that is washed, to her wallowing in the mire;" for the very same evening I stole a cheese out of a press in Holden: And the next Saturday I broke into the house of Mr. James Caldwell, in Barre, and stole near twen∣ty five dollars worth of clothing.</P>
<P>I tarried in Barre about twelve days, and then set off for Natick, and on the way I broke into a cellar, in Shrewsbury, and stole some bread and cheese—Whilst I tarried in Barre, I lived in the woods all the time—when I had got to Natick, I stole two pair of stockings and two pocket handkerchiefs, that were hanging out near a house.</P>
<P>From Natick I went to Sherburne, and broke open a store belonging to Mr. Samud Sanger, and stole between four and five dozen of buttons.</P>
<P>From thence I went to Mr. John Sanger's house, in the same town, broke it open, and stole a case bottle of rum, one bottle of cherry rum, six cakes of gigerbread, and as many biscuits: I searched for money, but found none.</P>
<P>At another tavern in the same town, I took out a pane of glass, and opened the window, but I was discovered by the landlord, made my escape, and went back to Natick, and tar∣ried there two days.</P>
<P>From Natick I went to Sroughtonham, and at Capt. Bent's (the place were I went down the chimney) the cellar being open, I went through it, and in the bar-room I stole fifteen shillings in money, one case bottle of rum, and one half dozen of biscuits.</P>
<P>Afterwards I went to Easton, and on the way I broke open a house, and stole some cheese, and two pair of shoes, and two pair of shoe buckles. At Easton I tarried two days, and then made my escape from two men who at∣tempted to take me up on suspicion that I had broken gaol. From thence I went to Attle∣borough, and through a window I stole two cheeses and at a tavern near the same place, I stole six shillings and eight pence, one case bottle of rum, a sailor's jacket, and one pair of silver knee buckles.</P>
<P>I then sat off for Providence, and by the way I opened a window, and stole one cotton jacket, one jack-knife; and at another house on the same way, I stole through a window one fine apron, one pocket handkerchief, and one pillow case.</P>
<P>I came to providence the 26th day of June, and not long after, I broke open a cellar, and stole one bottle of beer, some salt fish, and ten pounds of butter.</P>
<P>A few nights after, I went to Col. Mantons's in Johnston, and the cellar being open, I went into it, and stole twenty pounds of butter, near as much salt pork, one milk pail, one cheese cloth, and one frock.</P>
<P>A few nights after, I went to Justice Belknap's in the same place, and broke into his cellar, and stole about thirty pounds of salt pork, one neat's tongue, one pair of nippers, one box of awls, and one bag.—It remarkably happen∣ed on the 13th ultimo (the day that had been appointed for my execution) that I was com∣mitted to gaol in Providence, on suspicion of having stolen the things last mentioned, and on the 18th ult. I was brought back and con∣fined in this gaol again.—Many more thefts and other vicious, practices have I been guilty of, the particulars of which might tire the pa∣tience of the reader.</P>
<P>Some of the things I have stolen I have used myself—some of them I have sold—some have been taken from me—some I have hid where I could not find them again—and others I have given to lewd women, who induced me to steal for their maintenance. I have lived a hard life, by being obliged to keep in the woods; have suffered much by hunger, nakedness, cold, and the fears of being detected and brought to justice—have often been ac∣cused of stealing when I was not guilty, and others have been accused of crimes when I was the offender. I never murdered any person, nor robbed any body on the high∣way. I have had great dealings with women, which to their and my shame be it spoken, I often too easily obtained my will of them. I hope they will repent, as I do, of such wicked and infamous conduct. I have had a corres∣pondence with many women, exclusive of my wife, among whom were several abandoned Whites, and a large number of Blacks; four of the whites were married women, three of the blacks have laid children to me besides my wife, who has been much distressed by my behaviour.</P>
<P>Thus have I given a history of my birth, education and atrocious conduct, and as the time is very high in which I must suffer an ig∣nominious death, I earnestly intreat that all people would take warning by my wicked example; that they would shun the paths of destruction by guarding against every tempt∣ation; that they would shun vice, follow vir∣tue and become (through the assistance of the ALMIGHTY) victorious over the enemies of immortal felicity, who are exerting themselves to delude and lead nations to destruction.</P>
<P>As I am sensible of the heinousness of my crimes, and am sorry for my wicked conduct, in violating the laws of the great Governour of the Universe, whose Divine Majesty I have offended, I earnetly pray that he would for∣give my sins, blot out my multiplied trans∣gressions, and receive my immortal spirit into the Paradise of never ending bliss.</P>
<P>I ask forgiveness of my wife, and of all per∣sons whom I have injured. I return my sincere thanks to the Ministers of the Gospel, and others, who have visited me under my confine∣ment, for their counsels and admonitions, and for the good care they have taken of me: God reward them for their kindness, and con∣duct us all through this troublesome world to the regions of immortal felicity in the kingdom of Heaven—AMEN.</P>

<HEAD>The following POEM was written at the request of JOHNSON GREEN, by a prisoner in Worcester Gaol, and is at said GREEN's special request, added to his Life and Confession, as a PART of his DYING WORDS.</HEAD>
<L>LET all the people on the globe</L>
<L>Be on their guard, and see</L>
<L>That they do shun the vicious road</L>
<L>That's trodden been by me.</L>
<L>If I had shun'd the paths of vice;</L>
<L>Had minded to behave</L>
<L>According to the good advice</L>
<L>That my kind mother gave,</L>
<L>Unto my friends I might have been</L>
<L>A blessing in my days,</L>
<L>And shun'd the evils that I've seen</L>
<L>In my pernicious ways.</L>
<L>My wicked counduct has been such,</L>
<L>It's brought me to distress;</L>
<L>As often times I've suffer'd much</L>
<L>By my own wickedness.</L>
<L>My lewdness, drunkenness, and theft</L>
<L>Has often times—(behold)</L>
<L>Caus'd me to wander, and be left</L>
<L>To suffer with the cold.</L>
<L>Hid in the woods, in deep distress,</L>
<L>My pinching wants were such,</L>
<L>With hunger, and with nakedness</L>
<L>I oft did suffer much.</L>
<L>I've liv'd a thief; it's a hard life;</L>
<L>To drink was much inclin'd;</L>
<L>My conduct has distress'd my wife,</L>
<L>A wife both good and kind.</L>
<L>Though many friends which came to see</L>
<L>Me, in these latter times,</L>
<L>Did oft with candour, caution me</L>
<L>To leave my vicious crimes;</L>
<L>Yet when I had got out of gaol,</L>
<L>Their labour prov'd in vain;</L>
<L>For then, alas! I did not fail</L>
<L>To take to them again.</L>
<L>If I had not conducted so;</L>
<L>Had minded to refrain;</L>
<L>Then I should not have had to go</L>
<L>Back to the gaol again.</L>
<L>Thus in the Devil's service, I</L>
<L>Have spent my youthful days,</L>
<L>And now, alas! I soon must die,</L>
<L>For these my wicked ways.</L>
<L>Repent, ye thieves, whilst ye have breath,</L>
<L>Amongst you let be wrought</L>
<L>A reformation, lest to death,</L>
<L>You, like myself, be brought.</L>
<L>Let other vicious persons see</L>
<L>That they from vice abstain;</L>
<L>Lest they undo themselves, like me,</L>
<L>Who in it did remain.</L>
<L>I hope my sad and disinal fate</L>
<L>Will solemn warning be</L>
<L>To people all, both small and great,</L>
<L>Of high and low degree.</L>
<L>By breaking of the righteous laws,</L>
<L>I to the world relate,</L>
<L>That I thereby have been the cause</L>
<L>Of my unhappy fate.</L>
<L>As I repent, I humbly pray</L>
<L>That God would now remit</L>
<L>My sins, which in my vicious way</L>
<L>I really did commit.</L>
<L>May the old TEMPTER soon be bound</L>
<L>And shut up in his den,</L>
<L>And peace and honesty abound</L>
<L>Among the sons of men.</L>
<L>May the great GOD grant this request,</L>
<L>And bring us to that shore</L>
<L>Where peace and everlasting rest</L>
<L>Abides for ever more.</L>
