<HEAD>THE Rev. Mr. WHITEFIELD's ANSWER To the BISHOP of LONDON's LAST PASTORAL LETTER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I NEED make no Apology for troubling your Lordship with this. As your Lordship was pleased to make me the chief Subject Matter of your <HI>last Pastoral Letter,</HI> I think it my Duty to answer it in the best Manner I can.</P>
<P>Your Lordship is to be highly commended, for the Care you have taken in Watching over the Souls of those, who are committed to your <HI>Lordship'</HI>s Charge.—<HI>Luke-warmness</HI> and <HI>Enthusiasm</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="004457_0003_100D84166A8DE008"/>
are the two Rocks, against which even well-meaning People are in Danger of splitting All ought to be thankful to that Pilot, who will teach them to steer a safe and middle Course—I would gladly hope, that, <HI>a Zeal for God in the Discharge of your Duty, and a hearty Concern for the Safety of Souls</HI> moved your Lordship to write.—These are the Principles, I trust, which now ex∣cite me, to direct this Answer to your Lordship. And, blessed be <HI>God,</HI> that I can write with some∣what of that Love and Meekness which becomes a Disciple of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> and with all that Hu∣mility and Reverence, which is due from a Pres∣byter to a Bishop of the Church of <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lukewarmness</HI> and <HI>Enthusiasm,</HI> my Lord, are certainly the Bane of true <HI>Christianity.</HI> I thank your Lordship again for your kind Cautions a∣gainst them. The only Query is, <Q>Whether there was any Occasion for your Lordship's warning the People of your Dioc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s, against running into either of these Extremes, upon ac∣count of any thing I have either spoken or wrote?</Q> Your Lordship thinks there was; And you quote Passages out of my <HI>Journal</HI> to prove it; if it can be proved, I will ask publick Pardon, both of your Lordship and Them, with all my Heart.</P>
<P>As for your Cautions against <HI>Lukewarmness,</HI> I am not much concerned in them. You do not seem to point at me in particular; unless it is, where your Lordship, (<HI>Page</HI> 10) informs your
<PB N="3" REF="004457_0003_100D84166A8DE008"/>
People, <Q><HI>That a diligent Attendance on the Duties of the Station wherein Providence has placed them, is, in the strictest Sense, the serving of God.</HI></Q> None but those, who condemn Me unheard, can justly charge Me with affirming to the contrary.</P>
<P>However, I beg Leave to observe, that your Lordship, (<HI>Page</HI> 8.) calls that a very <HI>imperfect State</HI> of Christianity, which is no <HI>State</HI> of <HI>Christianity</HI> at all. St. <HI>Paul</HI> writing to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> Chap. 13. v. 5. says, <HI>Examine your selves, whether ye be in</HI> the Faith; <HI>Prove your own selves.</HI> And that they might have a certain Rule, whereby to judge whether they were <HI>in the Faith,</HI> truly so called, or not; he immediately adds, <HI>Know ye not your ownselves, how that Christ Jesus is</HI> IN you, <HI>except ye be Reprobates?</HI> So that, according to St. <HI>Paul'</HI>s Rule, <Q>He that finds, he has hitherto contented himself with a bare bodily Attendance upon the Publick Worship of <HI>God,</HI> and following his daily Employment on other Days, and with ab∣staining from the more gross and notorious Acts of Sin, and from doing any Hurt or Injury to his Neighbour, and has rested finally upon these as the Whole of that Christianity requires of him;</Q> is so far from being in a very <HI>imperfect State,</HI> as your Lordship is pleased to affirm, (<HI>Page</HI> 8) that he is in no State of <HI>Christianity</HI> at Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. No, My Lord, he is a <HI>Reprobate, i. e.</HI> one who at present is out of a State of Salvation, nor can he ever have any Assurance that he is in a State of Salvation, till he <HI>Knows that Jesus Christ
<PB N="4" REF="004457_0004_100D8419A64B5070"/>
is IN Him,</HI> by the <HI>indwelling of His Holy Spi∣rit.</HI> If I have mistaken your Lordship's Expression, I will freely beg your Pardon.</P>
<P>Another Thing, My Lord, to me seems dark∣ly expressed in (<HI>Page</HI> 8) (Oh<HI>!</HI> let not your Lordship be angry, for indeed I will endeavour to speak with all Gentleness and Humility!) Your Lordship's Words are these. <Q><HI>Nor need they any other Evidence besides those</HI> Good Dispositions <HI>they find in their Hearts, that the Holy Spirit of</HI> God <HI>co∣operates with their honest Endeavours to subdue Sin and grow in Goodness.</HI></Q> If by <HI>Good Dispositions,</HI> your Lordship only means <HI>Good Inclinations or Desires,</HI> I deny <HI>That</HI> to be a sufficient Evidence, that the <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>God</HI> co-operates with their honest En∣deavours to subdue Sin and grow in Goodness▪ For there is a great Difference between <HI>Good De∣sires</HI> and <HI>Good Habits.</HI> Many have <HI>One,</HI> who never attain to the <HI>Other.</HI> Many have good Desires to subdue Sin, and yet, resting in those good De∣sires, <HI>Sin has</HI> always had <HI>Dominion over them.</HI> A Person sick of a Fever! may desire to be in Health, but that Desire is not Health it self. In like Manner many have good Dispositions or de∣sires to be Good, but That is not Goodness it self. And consequently Men need more Evidence than good Depositions, to prove to Themselves or Others, <Q>That the Holy Spirit of <HI>God</HI> co-operates with their honest Endeavours to subdue Sin.</Q> If by good <HI>Dispositions,</HI> your Lordship means Good Habits wrought in the Heart by the Spi∣rit
<PB N="5" REF="004457_0004_100D8419A64B5070"/>
of <HI>God,</HI> such as Peace, Love, Joy, Long-suffering, Goodness, Truth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I then agree, a Man needs no other Evidence. For these are the proper and genuine Fruits of the Spirit it self.</P>
<P>Your Lordship immediately adds, <Q>Nor that, persevering in their Course, and praying to <HI>God,</HI> for his Assistance, and relying upon the Merits of <HI>Christ</HI> for the Pardon of all <HI>Such</HI> Sins, Fail∣ings, and Imperfections, as are more or less unavoidable in this mortal State.</Q> I beg leave to ask your Lordship, whether this does not fa∣vour too much of the common Divinity, <HI>viz.</HI> That we are to do some thing for ourselves; or, in other Words, that we have partly a Righte∣ousness of our own, and that <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o make UP the Deficiencies of That Righteous∣ness? What else can your Lordship mean, by saying, That we must rely on the Merits of <HI>Christ,</HI> for the Pardon of <Q>all <HI>Such</HI> Sins as are more or less unavoidable in this mortal State?</Q> Did <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> come into the World, My Lord, only to save us from the Guilt of <HI>Such Sins,</HI> as are more or less unavoidable in this mortal State? The Scriptures every where affirm, That Man hath no Righteousness of his own, That <HI>there is none Righteous, no not one:</HI> That <HI>all Our Righteous∣ness is as filshy Rags;</HI> and that <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> died not only to save us from the Guilt of all <HI>such Sins, Failings,</HI> and <HI>Infirmities,</HI> as are more or less unavoidable in this mortal State, but from all willful
<PB N="6" REF="004457_0005_100D841CCDB91B78"/>
Sins, and also from that original Corruption, which every Man naturally engendred of the Off-spring of <HI>Adam,</HI> brings into the World with him. I hope, I have not misunderstood or over∣strained your Lordship's Expression.</P>
<P>I come now to your Lordship's Caution against <HI>Enthusiasm.</HI> For that I suppose your Lordship intended more particularly against me.</P>
<P>And here, my Lord, I beg Leave to observe, That, in my Opinion, your Lordship has by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Means been clear enough in your Definition of the Word <HI>Enthusiasm.</HI></P>
<P>According to the fair Rules of Writing▪ was it not first Incumbent on your Lordship to shew, that the Word <HI>Enthusiast</HI> had a good as well as bad Meaning: That it signifies no more than <HI>a Person in God,</HI> and consequently every Christian, in the proper Sense of the Word, is an <HI>Enthu∣sia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t?</HI> For St <HI>Peter</HI> writes, <HI>That to us are given ex∣ceeding great and precious Promises, that by these we might be Partakers of the divine Nature.</HI></P>
<P>And our Church says. If we receive the Sacra∣ment worthily, We are one with <HI>Christ</HI> and <HI>Christ</HI> with us, We dwell in <HI>Christ</HI> and <HI>Christ</HI> in us. For which she has sufficient Warrant from our <HI>Lord's Prayer,</HI> John 17. 20. <HI>Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on Me through their Word.</HI> Ver. 21. <HI>That they all may be one, As Thou Father art in me, and I</HI> in <HI>Thee, that they also <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be one</HI> in <HI>us.</HI> Ver. 23. <HI>I</HI> in <HI>them and they in Me, that they may be made perfect in one.</HI> Ver. 26.
<HI><PB N="7" REF="004457_0005_100D841CCDB91B78"/>
that the Love wherewith Thou hast loved me, may, be</HI> in <HI>them▪ and I</HI> in <HI>them.</HI></P>
<P>But, indeed your Lordship's Definition of <HI>Enthusiasm,</HI> when examined, does not convey any ill Idea at all. <Q><HI>Enthusiasm,</HI> is a strong Perswasion on the Mind that they are guided in an <HI>extraor∣dinary</HI> Manner, by immediate <HI>Impulses</HI> and <HI>Im∣pressions</HI> of the Spirit of <HI>God.</HI></Q> Had your Lord∣ship said, a strong but <HI>Groundless</HI> Perswasion, that they are guided in an extraordinary Manner, it would have been to your Lordship's Purpose. But to affirm, without any Restriction, that a strong Perswasion that we are guided man ex∣traordinary Manner by immediate Impulses, is <HI>Enthusiasm</HI> in the worst Sense of the Word, when your Lordship yourself says, (<HI>Page</HI> 54) <Q>There is, no doubt, but <HI>God,</HI> when He pleases can work upon the Minds of Men by <HI>extraordinary</HI> Influences,</Q> to me seems a little inconsistent.</P>
<P>Your Lordship proceeds thus. <Q>And this is owing chiefly to the Want of distinguishing aright between the <HI>ordinary</HI> and <HI>extraordinary</HI> Operations of the <HI>Holy Spirit.</HI> The extraordina∣ry Operations were those, by which the A∣postles and Others, who were entrusted with the first Propagation of the Gospel, were en∣abled to work Miracles, and speak with Tongues in Testimony, that their Mission and Doctrine were from <HI>God.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I suppose, by <HI>extraordinary</HI> Operations, your Lordship means the same as being guided in an
<PB N="8" REF="004457_0006_100D841E5D691D20"/>
<HI>extraordinary Manner</HI> just above. And if so, ac∣cording to your Lordships own Definition, I am no <HI>Enthusiast.</HI> For I never did pretend to those <HI>extraordinary</HI> Operations of working Mira∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with Tongues, in Testimony, that my Mission and Doctrine were from <HI>God;</HI> I only say Claim to the ordinary Gifts and In∣fluences of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> which your Lordship, (<HI>Page</HI> 20) says, '<HI>Still continue</HI>': And what Need was there then, my Lord, that the People of your Lordship's Diocese should be cautioned against <HI>Enthusiasm</HI> upon my Account?</P>
<P>But your Lordship farther adds, the ordinary Gifts, <Q>However real and certain in themselves, are no otherwise discernible, than by their Fruits and Effects.</Q> Had your Lordship said, No otherwise discernible to <HI>others,</HI> than by their Fruits and Effects▪ it would have been right. But if your Lordship means they are no other∣wise discernible to ourselves, in my Opinion it is wrong; for it is possible, my Lord, for a Per∣son to feel and discern these ordinary Gifts and Influences of the Spirit in <HI>himself,</HI> when there is no Opportunity of discovering them to others. For instance, on Supposition that your Lordship was assisted by the blessed Spirit, in writing your Pastoral Letter—might not your Lordship be sensible of an inward Joy and Complacency, wrought by that felt same Spirit, which was not then discernible to others? So likewise it is pos∣sible for another to feel Joy in the Holy Ghost,
<PB N="9" REF="004457_0006_100D841E5D691D20"/>
with the rest of his Fruits, which at that Time may not be discernible to others; and which they who have never experienced the like, may not believe, though a Man d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> unto them. I hope, my Lord, these R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sonings carry with them their own Evidence.</P>
<P>But to proceed: (<HI>Page</HI> 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25▪) your Lordship has taken Pains to collect several Passages out of the publick Liturgy, to prove the Doctrine of Regeneration or our New Birth, to be the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> Your Reason for so doing, appears (<HI>Page</HI> 25.) <Q>to arm your People against any Sug∣gestions, as if our Church were regardless of the Doctrine of <HI>Regeneration</HI> and <HI>New Birth,</HI> as if there were Need for any Member of it, to seek elsewhere for a more <HI>Spiritual</HI> Service.</Q> If this, my Lord, was intended to arm your People against any such Suggestions made by <HI>me;</HI> indeed, your Lordship does not do me Jus∣tice. As your Lordship, I find, has done me the Honour, to peruse my third Journal, your Lordship may remember this Observation, (<HI>Page</HI> 39) that, after I had baptized an Adult, I proved the Necessity of the New Birth, from the Office of our Church.</P>
<P>In my Sermon, upon the <HI>Indwelling of the Spi∣rit of God,</HI> which I have made bol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd your Lordship with this Letter, you will find. I have quoted the Expressions of our own Church Offi∣ces, to prove the Doctrine of the New Birth, as
<PB N="10" REF="004457_0007_100D8420E701E6A0"/>
your Lordship does in your Pastoral Letter. My constant Way of preaching is, first, to prove my Propositions by Scripture, and then to illu∣strate them by the Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>s and Collects of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> Those that have heard me, can witness, how often I have exhorted them to he constnat at the Publick Service of the Church. I attend on it my self, and would read the Publick Liturgy every Day, if your Lordship's Clergy would give me Leave. What further Satisfaction can your Lordship require, that I do not suggest to your Lordship's People, <Q>as if our Church were regardless of the Doc∣trine of <HI>Regeneration</HI> and <HI>New Birth,</HI> and as if there were Need for any Member of it, to seek else∣where for a more <HI>Spiritual</HI> Service.</Q></P>
<P>In the following Paragragh, your Lordship has the same Insinuation, as though I wanted to introduce Extempore Prayer, and to lay aside the publick Liturgy of our Church. For after your Lordship had been speaking against praying by the Spirit, and affirming that the Scripture no where tells us, that Prayer is the <HI>single Work</HI> of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> your Lordship says to your People, <Q>You have great Reason to be thankful to <HI>God,</HI> for a publick Service prepared to your Hands.</Q> My Lord, I never said to the Contrary. But does not your Lordship seem to insinuate at the same Time, that we are not to depend on the Spirit of <HI>God</HI> to enable us to pray extempore, either in Publick, or private? That Prayer is not the <HI>single
<PB N="11" REF="004457_0007_100D8420E701E6A0"/>
Work</HI> of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> without any Co-operation of our own, I readily confess. But that the Spirit of <HI>God</HI> does assist true Christians to pray extem∣pore, now, as well as formerly, is undeniable, if the Scriptures be true. For what says the Apostle? <HI>We know not what to pray for, as we ought, but the Spirit it self helpeth our Infirmities, and maketh Intercession for us with Groanings, that cannot be utter∣ed.</HI> And this is founded upon a general Promise, made to all <HI>God'</HI>s People. <HI>Zacharias</HI> 12. 10, <HI>I will pour upon the House of</HI> David, <HI>and upon the Inha∣bitants of</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>the Spirit of Grace, and of Sup∣plication.</HI> And I believe, my Lord, we may ap∣peal to the Experience of all true Christians, whether or no they did not find the <HI>spirit of Supplication,</HI> or a Power of praying without a Form, encrease in Proportion to the Encrease of <HI>God'</HI>s Grace or Holy Spirit in their Hearts. This is all, my Lord, that I pretend to: And where is the Impropriety of this, when your Lordship confesses in the same Page, that the <Q>Spirit of <HI>God</HI> does particularly assist us, in a due Perfor∣mance of Religious Offices?</Q></P>
<P>Farther, as your Lordship seems to deny the immediate Assistance of the Holy Spirit in our particular Addresses at the Throne of Grace, so your Lordship seems to deny it also in our par∣ticular Actions. <Q>In like Manner, your Lord∣ship says, we are firmly persuaded in <HI>general,</HI> that we live under the gracious Influence of <HI>God'</HI>s <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> and that he both excites and enables
<PB N="12" REF="004457_0008_100D8423572AAA00"/>
us to do Good. But that this or that <HI>Thought</HI> or <HI>Action</HI> is an Effect of the sole Motion, or im∣mediate Impulse of the Spirit, without any Co-operation of our own Mind;</Q> (My Lord, who ever affirmed, that there was no Co-operation of our own Minds, together with the Impulse of the Spirt of God? Your Lordship adds, <Q>Or that the Holy Spirit, and our natural Concep∣tions, do respectively contribute to this or that Thought or Action, in such a Measure or to such a Degree; these are Things we dare not say.</Q> Indeed my Lord I <HI>dare say them.</HI> For if there be any such Thing as a Particular Provi∣dence, why may we not expect particular Direc∣tion from <HI>God's</HI> Holy Spirit in a particular Cases? Does not our Church, my Lord▪ teach us to pray, that <HI>God'</HI>s Holy Spirit may in all Things direct and rule our Hearts? But your Lordship says, we dare not say this, because our Saviour has told us, that we know no more of the working of the Spirit, than we know of the Wind, <HI>from whence it cometh, and whither it goeth.</HI> Neither need we know any more of them: But you must allow, that we know <HI>as much.</HI> Cannot your Lordship feel the Wind then? Does not your Lordship know when it makes any Impression upon your Body? So easy it is for a Spiritual Man to know when the Holy Spirit makes an Impression upon his Soul. Without acknow∣ledging this, all the Expressions of being <HI>led by the Spirit, walking by the Spirit,</HI> and such like, must
<PB N="13" REF="004457_0008_100D8423572AAA00"/>
be only so many Words without any real Mean∣ing. Your Lordship acknowledges, that the Holy Spirit does act in <HI>general,</HI> and why not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the <HI>particular</HI> Actions of our Lives also? For, can the <HI>One</HI> be without the <HI>Other?</HI> Does it not frequently happen, my Lord, that the Comfort and Happiness of our whole Lives, depend on <HI>one particular</HI> Action? And where then, my Lord, is the Absurdity of saying, that the Holy Spirit may even in the minutest Circumstance direct and rule our Hearts? I have been the more par∣ticular, my Lord, on this Part of your Lord∣ship's Letter, because if this be proved, many of your Lordship's Objections against my Journals, will fall to the Ground.</P>
<P><HI>Page</HI> 27. Your Lordship has the following Paragraph. <Q><HI>God</HI> forbid, that in this profane and degenerate Age, every thing that has an <HI>Appea∣rance</HI> of Piety and Devotion, should not be con∣sidered in the most favourable Light that it is capable of. But at the same Time, it is surely very Proper, that Men should be called upon for some reasonable Evidence of a <HI>Divine Com∣mission.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I take it for granted, that I am one of those Men, whom your Lordship thinks should be called upon for some reasonable Evidence of a <HI>Divine Commission.</HI></P>
<P>But, my Lord, what reasonable Evidence does your Lordship require? Did I not receive Let∣ters dimissory from your Lordship's own Hands
<PB N="14" REF="004457_0009_100D8425CFC425E8"/>
to be ordained Priest? Did I not, when ordai∣ned Deacon <Q>affirm that <HI>I</HI> was <HI>inwardly moved by the Holy Ghost,</HI> to take upon me that Office and Ministration?</Q> Did not my Lord of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> when he ordained me Priest, say unto me, <Q><HI>Re∣ceive</HI> thou the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> now committed unto thee, by the Imposition of our Hands, in the Name of the <HI>Father,</HI> and of the <HI>Son,</HI> and of the <HI>Holy Ghost?</HI></Q> And is not this, my Lord, a reaso∣nable Evidence that I act by a <HI>Divine Commission?</HI> If this be not true, must not All those whom your Lordship, or the other Bishops ordain, act only by a <HI>Human Commission?</HI> Nay, (to use the Words of Bishop <HI>Burnet</HI> in his <HI>Pastoral Letter</HI>) <Q>Must not they who are ordained, <HI>Lie</HI> not only unto Man but unto <HI>God,</HI> by saying, They are <HI>inwardly moved</HI> by the <HI>Holy Spirit?</HI></Q></P>
<P>If your Lordship in any wise disputes my act∣ing by a <HI>Divine Commission,</HI> you disclaim your own Divine Right and Authority; nor can you possibly avoid the Dilemma, of either allowing <HI>my Divine Commission,</HI> or denying <HI>your own.</HI> Af∣ter your Lordship has insinuated a Demand for the Evidences of my <HI>Divine Commission,</HI> immedi∣ately follows these Words, <Q>When they tell us of extraordinary Communications they have with <HI>God.</HI></Q></P>
<P>If by <HI>extraordinary Communications,</HI> your Lord∣ship means the extraordinary Operations of the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> as working Miracles, and speaking with Tongues; your Lordship may assure yourself, <HI>I</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="004457_0009_100D8425CFC425E8"/>
never pretended to any <HI>Such</HI> Thing—If, by <HI>extraordinary Communications,</HI> your Lordship means more Assistances and Comforts from <HI>God,</HI> at some times than I have at others, (which is all I mean by <HI>extraordinary Communications</HI>) I own the Charge? And what is there, my Lord, <HI>extraordinary</HI> in that?</P>
<P>Again, your Lordship says, (<HI>Page</HI> 28.) <Q>When they talk in the Language of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se, who have a special and immedia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>Mission</HI> from <HI>God.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And does your Lordship, and the rest of the Bishops, ordain any without obliging them first to give good Proofs, that they have a <HI>Special C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l</HI> or <HI>Immediate Mission</HI> from <HI>God</HI> to the Work of the Ministry? If ever you so do, my Lord, do not your Lordships lay Hands too suddenly upon Men?</P>
<P>(<HI>Page</HI> 29.) Your Lordship writes thus.—<Q>When they profess to think and act under the immediate Guidance of a <HI>Divine Inspiration.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And does not your Lordship think an act by the same Rule? Why, otherwise does your Lord∣ship Pray when you administer the <HI>Holy Commu∣nion,</HI> that <HI>God</HI> would cleanse the Thoughts of our Hearts by the <HI>Inspiration</HI> of his <HI>Holy Spirit?</HI></P>
<P>(<HI>Page</HI> 31.) Your Lordship says, <Q>When they speak of their Preaching and Expounding, and the Effects of them, as the sole Work of a <HI>Di∣vine Power.</HI></Q></P>

<P>Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, my Lord, is the Enthusiasm of such a Pretension? Has your Lordship been a Preacher in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> for so many years, and have you never seen any sudden or surpri∣zing Effects, consequent upon your Lordship's Preaching? Was this my Case, should I not have Reason to doubt, my Lord, whether I had any more than a bare <HI>Human Commission?</HI> Or might I not take up the Prophet's Lamentation, <HI>Oh my Leanness, my Leanness!</HI> My Lord, the Gospel, like it.

<P>What <HI>I</HI> have said about my Success. <HI>God</HI> has been pleased to fulfil already. What I have said about Suffering<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, they who without Cause are my Enemies, are fulfilling daily.

<P>If <HI>I</HI> am not to speak in an <HI>Apostolical</HI> Language, why did my Lord o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Gloucester</HI> give me an <HI>Aposto∣lical</HI> Commission▪ <Q><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> thou dost forgive, they are forgiven; and whose Sins thou dost re∣tain, they are retained?</Q> And I hope, my Lord, using the Words which <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> used, is not taking upon me the Character of <HI>Christ.</HI></P>
<P>(<HI>Page</HI> 36.) <Q>When they profess to plant and Propagate a <HI>New Gospel,</HI> as unknown to the Generality of Ministers and People, in a Chris∣tian Country.</Q></P>
<P>'Tis true, my Lord in one Sense, mine is a <HI>New Gospel,</HI> and will be always <HI>Unknown</HI> to the Generality of Ministers and People, even in a Christian Country, if your Lordship's Clergy follow your Lordship's Directions. For what says your Lordship (<HI>Page</HI> 46) <Q><HI>I</HI> hope, that
<PB N="18" REF="004457_0011_100D842B116EB138"/>
when Ministers Preach to you of <HI>Justifica∣tion by Faith alone,</HI> which is a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rted in the strongest Manner by our Church, they explain it in such a Manner as to leave no Doubt upon your Mind, whether good Works are a <HI>neces∣sary Condition</HI> of your being justified in the Sight of God.</Q></P>
<P>But pray, my Lord, where has the Scripture made good Works a <HI>Necessary Condition</HI> of our being justified in the Sight of God? St. <HI>Paul</HI> says, <HI>By grace ye are saved, thro' Faith, not of Works,</HI> and that, <HI>least any Man should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> For <HI>Eternal Life is the</HI> Gift <HI>of God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</HI> your Lordship exhorts your Clergy to preach <HI>Justification by Faith alone,</HI> and quotes the 11<HI>th</HI> Article of our Church, which tells us, we are justified by <HI>Faith</HI> only, and not for our own Works or Deservings.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the 11th, 12th, and 13th Articles at the End.</NOTE>At the same Time, your Lordship bids them <Q>explain it in such a Manner as to leave no Doubt upon their Minds, whe∣ther <HI>good Work</HI> are <HI>a necessary Condition</HI> of their being justified in the Sight of God.</Q> Your Lordship, in my Opinion, could not well be guilty of a greater inconsistency. This, my Lord, is truly a New Gospel. <HI>I</HI> am sure it is not what the Apostles Preached; and it is as contra∣ry to the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and the whole Tenour of the Gospel, as Light is contrary to Darkness. Had your Lordship in∣sisted on your Clergy's preaching up good Works
<PB N="19" REF="004457_0011_100D842B116EB138"/>
as a <HI>necessary Fruit</HI> and <HI>Consequënce,</HI> instead of a <HI>necessary Condtition</HI> of our being <HI>justified,</HI> your Lordship would have used your Authority aright. For we are commanded to shew forth or declare to others, that we have a <HI>True Faith</HI> by our <HI>Works.</HI> And the 12<HI>th</HI> Article of our Church says, that '<HI>good Works</HI> follow <HI>after Justification;</HI> and how then, my Lord, are they <HI>a necessary Condition</HI> of our <HI>Justification?</HI> No, my Lord, Salvation (if the Gospel be true) is the Free Gift of God through <HI>Jesus Christ. Faith</HI> is the▪ <HI>Means</HI> whereby that Salvation is applied to our Hearts, and good Works are the necessary <HI>Fruits</HI> and <HI>Proof</HI> of that <HI>Faith.</HI></P>
<P>This, my Lord, is the <HI>Doctrine</HI> of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> This is the <HI>Doctrine</HI> of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> And it is, because the Generality of the Clergy of the Church of <HI>England</HI> do not Preach this <HI>Doctrine,</HI> that I am resolved, <HI>God</HI> being my Hel∣per, to continue instant in Season and out of Sea∣son, to declare IT unto all Men, let the Conse∣quences, as to my own private Person, be what they will.</P>
<P>As for your Lordship's blaming me for rashly censuring the Clergy, for their Practice, none are concerned, but my <HI>Indolent, Earthly-minded, Pleasure-taking</HI> Brethren, (<HI>Page</HI> 39) And surely, your Lordship will not stand up in their Defence. No.—I hope your Lordship will not fail to re∣buke THEM <HI>sharply.</HI> And as for your Lord∣ship's <HI>Suspicions,</HI> (<HI>Page</HI> 50.)—(For your Lord∣ship's

Sake I would not Mention them) I hope my Life and Doctrine will always prove them to be Groundless.</P>
<P>Would Time permit, I could now proceed to satisfy your Lordship more particularly about the Case of Mr. <HI>Benjamin Seward:</HI> But as that is done in a Letter sent to my Lord of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> and pub∣lished in my last <HI>Journal;</HI> and as I am now to embark in a few Hours, <HI>I</HI> hope, your Lordship will excuse me, if I only add my hearty Pray∣ers for your Lordship's temporal and eternal Welfare, and subscribe my self,</P>

<HEAD>XI, Of the Justification of Man.</HEAD>
<P>WE are accounted righteous before God, <HI>Only</HI> for the Merit of our Lord and Saviour <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> by Faith, and not for our own Works, or Deservings. Wherefore, that we are justified by Faith ONLY, is a most wholesom Doctrine, and very full of Comfort, as more largely is ex∣pressed in the Homily of Justification.</P>

<HEAD>XII. Of good Works</HEAD>
<P>ALbeit that good Works, which are the Fruits of Faith, and follow after Justification, cannot put away our Sins, and endure the Seve∣rity of God's Judgment; yet are they pleasing and acceptable to God in <HI>Christ,</HI> and do spring out necessarily of a true and lively Faith, inso∣much that by them a lively. Faith may be as evidently known, as a Tree discerned by the Fruit.</P>

<HEAD>XIII. Of Works before Justification.</HEAD>
<P>WOrks done before the Grace of <HI>Christ,</HI> and the <HI>Inspiration</HI> of his Spirit, are not pleasant to God, forasmuch as they spring not of Faith in <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> neither do they make Men meet to receive Grace, or (as the the School-Authors say) deserve Grace of Congruity: Yea, rather for that they are not done as God hath willed and commanded them to be done, we doubt not but they have the Nature of Sin.</P>
