<P>Narrative of the Life, Last Dying Speech &amp; Confession OF JOHN YOUNG, Condemned to be executed this Day, for the Murder of ROBERT BARWICK, One of the Deputy Sheriffs.</P>
<P>The following Hymn was composed by John Young, to be sung at the place of Execution.</P>
<LG>
<L>To thee my God I daily sigh, but not for golden stores</L>
<L>Nor covet I the brightest Gems on the rich Eastern shore,</L>
<L>Nor Pleasures soft enticing charms, my fond desires alure.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>2. For greater things than earth can yield, my wishes would secure,</L>
<L>Those blissful, These Transporting Smiles, that brighten heaven above,</L>
<L>The boundless riches of thy grace, &amp; treasures of thy love</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>3. O let our tongues be one to praise our God on High,</L>
<L>Who from his bosom sent his Son, to fetch us strangers nigh</L>
<L>O my Saviour's pierc'd side pour'd out a double Flood,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>4. By water we are Purified, and Pardoned by the blood</L>
<L>It cost him cries, and many tears, to bring us near to God</L>
<L>Great was our Debt, and it appears to make our payment good.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>5. What tho' the Hosts of death and hell all armed a∣gainst me stood,</L>
<L>Terrors no more shall shake my soul, my refuge is my God,</L>
<L>Arise O Lord, fulfil thy Grace, while I thy Glory sing,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>6. My God has broke the Serpents teeth, and Death has lost his sting,</L>
<L>Salvation to the lord belongs, his arm alone can save,</L>
<L>Blessing attend thy people here, and reach beyond the grave.</L>

<HEAD>Dying Speech, Life &amp; Confession Of JOHN YOUNG,</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>"Man is born to trouble as the Sparks fly upwards"</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE World usually anticipate from an un∣fortunate man in a situation like mine, a dying confession; not so much to comply with this custom as to remove the odium that now does, and after my decease may exist in the minds of many, if I pass hence into eternity, "from whose bourne no traveller returns," without such a narrative, has induced me to pen the following lines. To vouch for the truth of them I presume nothing need be said more, than that they are the last words of a dying man, who looks for∣ward with the pleasing hope of salvation and comfort in regions of bliss far beyond what this transitory life can afford.</P>
<P>I die, so do all mankind, but I die untimely, mine is an unhappy end It needs not then that I speak of my parents and relations, who or what they are, is of little moment to the Public, thus silent, they will avoid the taunts of unfeeling men I shall therefore touch not on the transactions of my life at an early period, but confine myself to those leading points, that have precipitated me in the vortex of ignominious dissolution.</P>
<P>In 1793 I was in a respected situation at Phi∣ladelphia as a publisher of Music, carressed by men of Virtue and Influence, as I had no capital I was necessitated to attempt to extend the Sale of my Merchandize by Subscription over the whole Continent, with this view I proceeded to Charleston, from thence to New-York, took up
<PB N="3" REF="033255_0003_0FF769B99D9987A8"/>
my Lodgings at Mrs. Weisenfelt's, finding my∣self unable to prosecute my plan on an extensive Scale, and being much pressed for Money I en∣gaged with Mr. Ricketts as a Musician, about this time I became acquainted with a Mr. Daniel Thew, Notary Public of this City, from the ap∣parent advantages that might arise by the Publi∣cation of Music, he made me proposals to ad∣vance a capital provided he received his part of the Profit, we agreed, the Sum was to be 3 col. at his request I went to Boston to obtain Subscri∣bers, he advanced for the expence of my Journey 95 Dollars. On my arrival, and afterwards I wrote him several Letters, but receiving no an∣swer I suspected his intentions were to deceive me, in consequence of which I returned to New∣York, on my arrival at my lodgings I found the the whole of my Apparel gone as well as upwards of 100 scratched Songs, I could gain no further information on the subject, more than that Mr. Thew as my partner had taken possession my room and removed every thing in a few days after my departure for Boston; in a short time I was served with a writ at the suit of this very Thew, for the monies advanced for my Journey from Boston and about 30 dollars in addition, which he had paid on my account; destitute as I was, I must have gone to Gaol, had not that worthy man Mr. Abraham Skinner by his humanity pre∣vented it, a succession of disappointments invol∣ved me in difficulties, my Creditors became cla∣morous, I was again arrested in the Bear Market by one who called himself a deputy Sheriff,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Handay side.</NOTE> and was dragged near a mile, when lo! I discovered he had no writ, but was privy to Mr. Canon's
<PB N="4" REF="033255_0004_0FF769BB20661528"/>
having one against me, to whose custody I was turned over, Thus it is Debtors are abused, thus it is, in a State who boast their protection of the subject and their detestation of despotic sway, permit their administrators of Justice to twist an arbitary construction of the Laws, to countenance these hirelings to distress the honest tho' unfortu∣nate Citizens it requires more than mortal forti∣tude to resist punishing such mortals, who regard more extortion, than the administration of Justice</P>
<P>I was conducted to Goal previous to this, and after my connection with Thew, I entered into partnership with one Isaac Samo, to whose base∣ness I attribute Berwick's and my death. He ad∣vanced me 50 dollars, and afterwards 60 more, in part of his contract with me of 150 dollars, the sum agreed on. Soon after the commence-of the publication, I was arrested as above men∣tioned. Samo refused to bail me; he pretended the business would be at a stand, and he should loose his money. Though it appeared plain to me afterwards, his only intention was to get all the materials in his own hands, and gather from me as much information as possible, relative to the business, with the view of commencing by himself, and leaving me in my misfortunes.</P>
<P>I continued in confinement near four months, when I was relieved by a new contract with Mr. Ricketts; some time after my discharge I received a note from a Mr. CONSTANT an Attorney, requesting to see me. I called on him, he infor∣med me he had an account against me at the suit of Mrs. Miller, with whom I formerly boarded, I was astonished, as I did not conceive I was in∣debted to her any thing; she had at various
<PB N="5" REF="033255_0005_0FF769BF4C9FCBD8"/>
times received money from me to the amount of Eighty-three dollars, and had departed for Am∣sterdam; I refusing payment he served a writ on me, for which I gave bail, my astonishment after∣wards ceased when I was informed by a Mr. Crawford, wholesale Grocer at the Ship-Yards, that this VERY HONEST LAWYER CONSTANT, had purchased for Ten Dollars this imaginary debt of Mrs Miller; shame, shame on such prac∣tices, practices that disgrace the name of civili∣zation, which every honest mind must revolt at, and which I am sorry too say, is too much coun∣tenanced by those whose duty as well as inclina∣tion should teach to punish more than encourage such infamy.</P>
<P>From this period I was continually harrassed with writ after writ till my life became miserable, at this time Samo called on me, proposed as there was little prospect of continuing the business, I should give him my notes for the money advan∣ced and he would wholly relinquish what he had of mine, I complied; gave them at 60, 90, and 120 days. I repeatedly sent for the articles be∣longing to me but without effect, but seemed to intimate he should hold them as security for pay∣ment of the Notes, this was an act of the great∣est injustice which he best knows how to reconcile being compelled secrete myself fearful of arrest, I neglected to give speciel bail to Constants suit, he obtained executiion against me, I was taken to Goal and remained in confinement thirteen weeks, when I was discharged by pledging an Instrument and my Note for 85 dollars, in the in∣terim Samo's notes became due, he pressed me for the payment after my discharge though he still
<PB N="6" REF="033255_0006_0FF769A4544CF9C8"/>
held my property the only means I had of raising the money for his payment, we had frequent conversation on this subject but could not effect any settlement.</P>
<P>At last on my return from Col. Burr's where I had been with music to Mrs. Temple, when scarcely in the house ten minutes Berwick called on me said he had something against me at the suit of Samo; I requested him to go with me to Samo's house about 30 yards distant, on my arri∣val I solicited a settlement, Samo observed he had nothing to do in the business, my stay was not more than three minutes we then walked away, this was at the top of Cedar street, we never went into any place nor spoke to any one till I stop'd at the bottom of the Park. I never saw the writ, nor any thing he had against me, I re∣quested him to go with me to some other place he positively said no; distres'd in mind, harras'd with my cares, and the dread of again being con∣fined operated at this moment to determine me not to go to Gaol, I put my hand in pocket drew out a Pistol and at the same Time desired him repeatly aloud to keep his distance, he rashly re∣fused my advice, rushed on the mouth of the Pi∣stol, I fired without any direction other than a pointed arm, he fell—Let any man Judge what time it will take for two persons to walk a smart pace from the top of Cedar street to the bottom of the Park, which was all the time he was with me except when at Samo's, they then can form an opinion what credit ought to be given to those who swore Berwick and I were together three hours previous to his death; as for the writ, I call God to witness I never saw it till the morning of my trial before the Court.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="033255_0007_0FF769C682CCCC00"/>
I pity from my Soul those three unfortunate perjured people who swore against me. I pray God to have mercy on them.</P>
<P>The one that swore he heard Berwick say he was tired going about from place to place with me for three hours and that he would go no further.</P>
<P>The poor wretch that swore we walked arm and arm together and that I declared he had taken many persons but should never take another when I shot him; they are both false. The day of punishment will come when their perjured consciences will rise up in judgment against them.</P>
<P>And the Mulatto who swore she was so near us, that the smoke went in her face, and yet did not hear a word that pass'd between Berwick and myself; she certainly must have been between us, otherwise it could not have gone in her face, as I saw it rise direct between Berwick and me.</P>
<P>I forgive them all, as well as my enemies who have delu∣ded these people, and pray God to forgive them, as I hope he will forgive me. God Almighty bless my friends and all good people.</P>
<P>To authenticate the above writings, Mr. Abraham Skinner has the writings between Thew and me, Mr. Hunn, the agreement between Samo and myself, or on Mr. Watson, now in Prison, who is in possession of the last writing between Isaac Samo and me, executed at the time I gave my note, though he afterwards refused to com∣ply with his own signature; he has likewise an account in Mrs. Millar's hand writing of what was due her, which CONSTANT gave me so much trouble about.</P>
<P>Creditors trust not your papers in the hands of those tolerated Leeches, that call themselves Sheriff's Officers, Creditor or Debtor is of little consequence to them, their only object is to suck profit to themselves. Many Attornies are no better, a Bill of Costs, and not the advantage of the Creditor, is usually the stimulus to their industry.</P>
<P>Creditors! turn your Eyes to the only Bastile in this Land of boasted Freedom, see there many unfortunate worthy Citizens, shut up from the World, their families, friends and relatives; and why: because they are unable to discharge in FULL their debts, remember that one Years imprisonment will not pay one shilling of debt, re∣member

Do honor to yourselves, and justice to those you represent, by acts of wisdom and justice—Remember 'tis the Words of a Dying Man who has experienced <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</P>
<P>I shall now conclude with only one more remark, that is on the severity of the Court, allowing me so short a time for preparation for my trial, though I informed them I was not prepared with my Witnesses and Counsel.</P>
<P>The Lord God have Mercy on all my Friends, and God Bless them, Adieu.</P>
