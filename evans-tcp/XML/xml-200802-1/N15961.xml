<SPEAKER>Spoken by Mr. BANNISTER, jun.</SPEAKER>
<L>PROLOGUES, with caustic touch, have often tried</L>
<L>To probe your spleen, prove knaves and fools allied;</L>
<L>Have twisted words and wit ten thousand ways,</L>
<L>To shew that these are most degenerate days!</L>
<L>-A different task be ours.—We'll prove that you</L>
<L>Are wise and happy. Nay! tho' strange, 'tis true!</L>
<L>First on your <HI>safety</HI> think! now belles appear</L>
<L>By ample bulwarks guarded, front and rear!</L>
<L>Now male and female amble, side by side,</L>
<L>Exempt from harm, by breast-works fortify'd!</L>
<L>Here polygons defend Miss Molly's breast!</L>
<L>There horn-work's bush the husband's fears to rest!</L>
<L>By ramparts, daily rais'd, he's freed from cares;</L>
<L>If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but grant sufficient for repairs.</L>
<L>Our strength thus prov'd, proceed we to disclose</L>
<L>How new-made wealth thro' new-made channels flows!</L>
<L>How rich we are, in medal-rust and rare things!</L>
<L>In copper coins, gilt pence and—Queen-Anne-farth∣ings!</L>
<L>How shells, stuff'd monkies, and Cremonas old,</L>
<L>In hand of Auctioneer, are current gold!</L>
<L>He "Going ! going!" cries. "The hammar's up!</L>
<L>"This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ne antique! this Roman—<HI>candle-cup!</HI>"</L>
<L>A gem so rare makes connisseurs turn pale,</L>
<L>Fearful, alike, to purchase or to fail!</L>
<L>Hope trembles, starts, from lip to lip rebounds,</L>
<L>'Till down she's knock'd by—Ah!—one thousand pounds!</L>
<L>The envied purchaser, with joy elate,</L>
<L>Pays for his prize by—selling his estate!</L>
<L>While <HI>Smirk,</HI> in storid style, words nicely plac'd,</L>
<L>Protests the lot does, <HI>anner</HI> to his taste! <HI>(Mimicking.)</HI></L>
<L>Yes! sure you're happy! and should rest content,</L>
<L>Now landscapes are reduc'd fifteen percent:</L>
<L>And Claude's and Titian's new-found wonders may</L>
<L>By new-made Peers be bought—if new-made Peers can pay.</L>
<STAGE><PB REF="020425_0005_0FC7415E0B5A18F0"/><HI>(Assuming sorrow.)</HI></STAGE>
<L>One thing, indeed, may well your peace invade,</L>
<L>Pawnbrokers! threaten you to leave off trade!</L>
<STAGE>(Weeps.)</STAGE>
<STAGE>(Returning to his former chearful tone.)</STAGE>
<L>All things considered, now, while safety smiles,</L>
<L>And wealth inundates thus our Queen of isles;</L>
<L>While Vickery head defects so soon repairs,</L>
<L>And half unpeoples Greenland of her bears;</L>
<L>While exhibitions, galas and reviews,</L>
<L>Lisle-street, Vanxhall, the Abbey, Handel, Hughes,</L>
<L>Flutes, fiddles, trombos, double-drums, bassoons,</L>
<L>Mara, the speaking-figure, fish-balloons,</L>
<L>Earth-baths, live-eagles, such as never flew,</L>
<L><HI>L'Hercule du Roy!</HI> and General Jackoo!</L>
<L>While these create a round of such delight,</L>
<L>Sure, we may hope, you will not frown to-night!</L>
<L>While farces numerous as these go down,</L>
<L>Our farce may in its turn amuse the town,</L>
<L>And, smiling thus on Folly's vast career,</L>
<L>Sure not on us, alone, you'll be severe!</L>

<SPEAKER>FLORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I Can't go at present, Mr. Jerome, for I expect my Lady every moment to ring, and if I should be out of the way <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> will be angry; and as I am but new in her service.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<P>She angry! Oh you don't know her yet—When you have been a day or two with her you'll find she <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> angry— She is the best temper'd creature—and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> not for her aversion to us men, she would not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FLORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you consider that as a fault, Mr. Jerome?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure I do—For my part, I think she had much better be too fond of us, as the rest of her sex are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FLORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Mr. Jerome, what caused her aver∣sion to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you Flora, if it won't make you melancholy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FLORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, no, Mr. Jerome—I like a melancholy story—I like dearly to cry, when it is not on my own account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then—when my lady was only 15 she <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> with a fine handsome young fellow, interior to her both in rank and forturne; but my good old Lord, her father, who doated upon her, was afraid
<PB N="6" REF="020425_0007_0FC74164CBE885E0"/>
a disappointment might break her heart, and so con∣sented to her having him; but he proved so bad a husband, that my poor old master soon died with grief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FLORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor man!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't cry yet, there's something worse to come—My Lady, on this, took such a dislike to her husband, that he died of grief too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FLORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Mr. Jerome, this is very moving.</P>
</SP>

<P>On this—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FLORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope there is nothing worse to come?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<P>On this, my Lady made a vow to shut herself up from the whole sex.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FLORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, that is more affecting than any of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<P>And she immediately retired to this lonely Castle, where, except the house of Donna Isabella, next door, we have not a neighbour for miles, and even there we are strangers—for my part I have never so much as seen Donna Isabella, or exchanged a word with any of the servants since they came to the place—tho' indeed they have not been here above eight days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FLORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how long has my Lady kept this vow of avoiding all your sex?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<P>Eighteen months.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FLORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Eighteen weeks! what a time!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<P>Months.</P>

<P>Not she.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FLORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>O but I am sure she must have lost some of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you no.—But I must leave you now Mrs. Flora, for yonder is Don Antonio, and I believe he is coming this way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FLORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought no man was admitted into the castle but you, Mr. Jerome?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; Don Antonio lives here—but then he is my Lady's uncle; and you know there can be no fear of her falling in love with him, as he is a relation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FLORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>But <HI>you</HI> are no relation, Mr. Jerome.</P>

<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, as you say, she might fall in love with me—Stranger things have happened—and to tell you the truth, she does not seem positive she shan't, for she bids me keep out of her sight as much as possi∣ble, for fear I should put her in mind of that handsome villain that brought her to this retirement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FLORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here comes the old Gentleman!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEROME.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I must go, for he'll be wanting to say something to you—he is for ever running after the maids—I am sorry to leave you—I am, indeed, Flora; indeed I am—Oh it would be a happy thing for me if I could bring myself to care as little for the women, as my lady does for the men.</P>

<P>Hah!—what!—what is all this!—what have we here?—what have we here? a pretty girl—a very pretty girl indeed!—My niece's new maid, I suppose—Aye, aye, I had the other sent about her business—She must be like her mistress forsooth, and have nothing to say to a man—<HI>(going up to Flora)</HI> My dear, come this way—I think your's is a new face—</P>

<P>Well, Inis—I am impatient to hear—What success?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>INIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Delightful, Madam—I have been introdu∣ced to the young Countess—I first communicated the
<PB N="10" REF="020425_0011_0FC7416DEC914570"/>
intelligence of the pretended plot forming against her to her waiting woman, who was sufficiently alarmed at it, to take me to her Lady immediately.</P>

<SPEAKER>ISABEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ISABEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>INIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>And then, before I discovered what I had to say, I made her promise not to betray me, which she did most solemnly, and without the least reluctance—and now, Madam, says I, I live servant with your neighbour, Donna Isabella, a slighty Lady, who turns every thing serious and sacred into ridicule; and she has resolved to make sport of you for pretending an aversion to men, and for that purpose she has procured recommendations for you to receive the visits of the young Marquis her brother, but instead of him, she proposed to come herself, disguised as a man, prevail on yon to consent to be married to her, and then throw off the mask, and make you and your vow the jest of the whole kingdom.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>ISABEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is all right—go on.</P>

<SPEAKER>ISABEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes—The Countess, from what you have told her, will suppose him a woman, receive him, and consequently suffer a thousand endearing familiari∣ties; till, charmed by the graces of his mind and per∣son, she shall love him without <HI>knowing</HI> it, and, when she detects the impostor, be unable to part with him.</P>

<P>He has nothing to <HI>act,</HI> being the very person he represents, and therefore shall not know of the art by which he is introduced—for, except being a little too attentive to dress and etiquette, a circum∣stance which, with his youthful appearance, favours our design, he is one of the most amiable young men in the world, and the least idea of imposition would shock his honour, and put an end to my scheme.</P>

<P>Niece, I was this moment coming to you, to bring these letters from your uncle at Madrid, which you will find recommend, in the strongest man∣ner, to your acquaintance, no other than the young Marquis our neighbour—as fine a youth as ever I saw.</P>

<P>Niece, I always knew you could not keep your vow—I always knew the very first man that came in your way—crash it would go direcly; but let me persuade you to break it by degrees, and not let the world say you made no struggle first.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Struggle! Now, my dear Uncle, with all your deep discernment, particularly in regard to our sex, to see you at last imposed upon delights me.</P>

<P>Your uncle's behaviour, Madam, has something in it rather extraordinary—I hope I have not in any means offended him?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARQUIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha, ha—I protest no more can I—Sure fate directed me to this heavenly spot, where ceremony has no share in politeness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did you suppose I should use any ceremony with such a sweet, sweet fellow as you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARQUIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Egad, I'll use no ceremony either. <HI>(Aside.)</HI> Thus, on my knees, let me pour my thanks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COUNT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh you artful creature!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Stroking his cheek.</STAGE>
<SP>

<P>Art! I disclaim it—and so do you—You are all pure nature.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I positively do think you one of the cleverest of your whole sex.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARQUIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank you.—Thank you—my dearest creature.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>(Kissing her hand.)</STAGE>
<SP>

<P>So negligent—so easy—not the least awkward or embarrassed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARQUIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Egad, I think you as little embarrassed to the full. <HI>(Aside.)</HI> My dear Madam, your char∣ming society has inspired me.</P>
</SP>

<P>Now if you were really a <HI>man,</HI> what would you <HI>deserve</HI> for that?</P>

<P>Madam!</P>

<P>I say, if you were <HI>really</HI> a man, what would you deserve for that freedom?</P>

<P><HI>Really</HI> a man! Why?—What—Don't I look like a man?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes—that you do—and a sweet pretty man—Come, come, don't be frightened—shake hands—I forgive you—forgive you all your impertinence—and, early the jest as far as you will, I am resolved not to be angry.</P>

<P>Oh, Uncle, I have been so ill-used by this Gentleman, that I must beg you will resent his behaviour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARQUIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>How!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANTO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, my dear, if you <HI>have</HI> been used ill.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARQUIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my honour, Sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zounds, Sir, my Niece is one of the most reserved, prudent young women—and whosoever offers an insult to her, it is my place, and consistent but with my honour, to resent it.—How white she looks.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARQUIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I shall not draw my sword before the Countess, and therefore I beg you will put up yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so I will, my poor Lady—I see it has frightened you—Here, Niece, have you any hartshorn or drops at hand—the poor thing is terrified out of her life. Come, come, my poor little creature—Poor thing—Poor rogue.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>(He goes up to sooth him, and the Marquis gives him a blow.)</STAGE>

<P>I have received many a blow from a Lady, but never such a one as this!.</P>

<P>Do you dare to call me a Lady again, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Lady, oh no—you are a tyger, a fury.</P>

<SP>

<P>I never met with such usage!—Damnation!</P>

<P>What a profligate she is! I did not think such a word could come out of a woman's mouth!</P>

<P>How, Sir!—Dare you say that again, and I'll nail you to the wall.</P>

<P>To frighten me!—Did you think I was to be frightened?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not! you see I am.</P>

<SPEAKER>MARQUIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I see, and scorn you for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Uncle, the tables are fairly turned upon you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Niece, and I'm much obliged to you, for your advice in the business—But you may depend upon it, I shall take care how I attempt to frighten one of your sex again.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Going.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARQUIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come back, Sir; I insist upon your coming back, and recalling what you have said—I insist upon your begging my pardon for your imperti∣nent insinuation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO.</SPEAKER>
<P>What insinuation?—That I think you a female?—I am sure there is no offence meant in that—for, when I suppose you a woman, I suppose you what I like better than any thing in the world; what I am never happy without; and what I even make myself poor, despised, and ridiculous, in the daily pursuit of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARQUIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, Sir, in what do I appear like a woman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, Sir, in what does any of our modern coxcombs appear like a man? and yet they don't scruple to call themselves men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARQUIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you will not recall your senti∣ments and beg my pardon?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Beg your pardon?—No—Yes, yes—Put on your petticoates, and I'll fall at your feet as soon as you please.—</P>

<P>See, Jerome, how my life is assailed.</P>

<P>I am sorry for your misfortune.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARQUIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don Antonio, this treatment I suppose you inflict as a just recompence for my presumption in daring to hope for an alliance in your family, spite of the prejudice which I knew the Countess had conceiv∣ed. I cannot deny the justice of the accusation—I came into her house with the vain hope—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means <HI>vain</HI>—I am ready to comply, be your hopes what they will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARQUIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can I believe what you say real?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly—Were you going to say you hoped to marry me? If you were, call the Priest, and we'll be married immediately.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, if that is what your Lordship wants, the Priest shall tack you together in five minutes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARQUIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>This sudden consent staggers me—I was not prepared for it—one likes a little preparation before marriage as well as before death.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Aside.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! you are cast down—alarmed—want to recant—but I won't let you—You <HI>shall</HI> marry me—I insist upon it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARQUIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! directly?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, directly—I am in a hurry.</P>

<P>Sister Isabella, when I shall relate to you the strange reception I have met with in this house, you will be amazed—but I think you will sincerely re∣joice at the final event of my visit, when I tell you it is a solemn promise from this Lady to become my wife.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>ISABEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Countess, I knew you never would have consented to have seen the Marquis, had he been intro∣duced into the house as a man, therefore I formed this stratagem, unknown to him, thus to bring you together.</P>
